That mean the electric-car maker will soon share it total quarterli vehicl deliveries.Ahead of Tesla' first-quart updat on vehicl deliveries, here' a close look at what investor know.Tesla vehicl outsid of Tesla factory. Imag source: Author.makeArticleAd();A wildcard quarterTypically, Tesla investor have some solid visibl into potenti vehicl deliveri for a given quarter. But there' much more uncertainti surround thi quarter' possibl deliveri than usual, as Tesla opt to onli provid guidanc for the first half of the year -- without specifi what it expect for the first quarter.For the first half of the year, Tesla said it expect to deliv 47,000 to 50,000 Model S and Model X vehicl combined, up 62% to 72% compar to same period in 2016.Investor also know that Tesla end it fourth quarter with a record 6,450 vehicl in transit to customers, set the compani up for a strong start to the quarter. Tesla also said demand for it vehicl is look up; order for the Model S and Model X combin were up 49% year over year and were 24% higher than ani other quarter, manag said.But even thi inform still leav lot of room for guesswork sinc quarterli deliveri can also be influenc by the time of shipment to differ regions, as well as by product challenges. The best ballpark figur investor can arriv at for estim Model S and Model X deliveri in the first quarter, therefore, is one that simpli cut Tesla' forecast for the first half of the year in half. Assum Tesla deliv half of it 47,000 to 50,000 estim unit for the first half of the year in Q1, it would impli 23,500 to 25,000 deliveri dure the quarter -- up from 22,252 deliveri in the fourth quarter of 2016 and 14,820 unit in the first quarter of 2016.Investor should look for Tesla' first-quart deliveri to be between about 23,500 and 25,000. But sinc thi estim is extrapol from guidanc for a broader period, investor shouldn't be surpris if actual deliveri deviat from thi estimate. If deliveri do come in below or abov thi level, investor may want to look into a reason for the variance.Look for an updat on demandBeyond Tesla' report deliveri in it upcom update, which is usual releas within three calendar day of the quarter' close (anywher between April 1 and April 3), investor may want to look for an updat on demand for Model S and Model X.Model 3.

Assum the predict is on the money - when doe it get there, and more importantly, how?Ther are three answer to thi question, in my opinion, the first be the best option for TSLA stock blow past $500 on it way to $1,000.TSLA Need to Be ProfitableIt' a simpl concept but one that investor have grappl with sinc TSLA stock startedtradingon June 29, 2010. Sinc then, it ha amass $2.4 billion in oper loss and $17 billion in revenue. That' an averag of $343 million in annual oper loss and $2.4 billion in annual revenu for a 14.2% neg oper margin.It ha never made money on an annual basis, not even with the zero-emiss vehicl (ZEV) credit it sell from time to time as a result of produc emission-fre vehicles. In Q3 2016 it did make a $0.71 per share non-GAAP profit, but that included$139 millionin ZEV credit sold dure the quarter. Without the ZEV credit accord to UB lead auto analyst Colin Langan, it would have been a $0.18 loss.7 Small-Cap Tech Stock on the Cut EdgeFutur earn are what ultim drive stock prices.If Tesla could simpli gener posit free cash flow on an annual basis, it would be more than enough ammunit for the bull that TSLA stock wa worth own at $500 and beyond. Of course, it doesn't - neg free cash flow in 2016 of$1.4 billion- henc the line in it 2016 10-K:""Until we are consist gener posit free cash flows, we may need or want to rais addit fund through the issuanc of equity, equity-rel or debt secur or through obtain credit from financi institut to fund, togeth with our princip sourc of liquidity, the cost of develop and manufactur our current or futur vehicles.""That' exactli what Tesla did recent when it raised$1.2 billionin cash - $350 million in new equiti and $850 million in senior convert note - to pad the amount of capit avail to bring the Model 3 to production.Blow past $500 would be a lot more of a sure thing if it start make some kind of a GAAP-lik profit. Until then, you'r go to have a lot of skeptics. That' just the natur of the beast.TSLA Stock Is a Winner If Model 3 Is a SuccessTh honeymoon is over.Elon Musk ha said that it will produce5,000Model 3s' per week in the fourth quarter of 2017, ramp up to 10,000 per week in 2018. At 400,000 pre-ord it will like fill that pent-up demand sometim in 2019.Skeptic point out that Tesla ha onli deliv 183,000 vehicl over the last five years, make thi kind of product increas fraught with risk. If Tesla can't meet the pre-ord demand in a time fashion, the odd of the Model 3 becom a big commerci success decreas exponenti put signific downward pressur on TSLA stock and ultimately, Tesla' long-term viability.""Whil we are bullish about Tesla' long-term potential, we have sever near term concerns, most notabl (1) gross margins, as Model 3 and it associ capex ramp up, and (2) Tesla' overal custom experi - which we believ is not strong today - and could be further pressur as the compani migrat to sell to a more mass-market consumer,"" a Bernstein analyst recentlywrotein a note to investors. ""A poor ramp and custom experi on Model 3 could not onli impact Tesla' near-term financials, but undermin the franchis longer-term.""Th posit in all of thi is that Tesla is said to be alreadi make ""releas candidate"" version of theModel 3, elimin the costli ""prototype"" phase, which suggest the company' abil to get concept vehicl into product in a time manner will continu to improv in the future. Thi bode well for it futur vehicl and the Model 3.Model YCar compani are known to use a singl platform to produc sever differ vehicl in one product facility. Tesla is said to be introduc itsModel Ycrossov SUV sometim in 2018; it' a vehicl that could be built on the same platform as the Model 3. If so, the cost of produc the Model Y would drop significantli help to point it way toward GAAP profit and automot mass production.BofA Think FireEye, Inc. (FEYE) Stock Ha 70% Upside. Here' Why.W don't even know if the Model 3 is go to be a hit, but a smooth rollout later in 2017 should pave the way for strong demand of the Model Y.Bottom Line on Tesla StockIn December, IsuggestedTesla stock belong in one' IRA, albeit that it shouldn't repres more than 5% of your plan. The reason: TSLA stock is still a risk despit all the good thing happen at the company.Frankly, I think Tesla stock get to $500 by thi time next year, becaus by then we'll know if the Model 3 is a success or failure. When it start make money, and that' a bigif, $1,000 will look like chump chang in the scheme of things.Unfortunately, there' a lot of water to go under the bridg yet. If you'r long, I'd stay long. If you'r short, good luck to you, and if you don't own TSLA stock, I wouldn't get overli aggress in your purchas until it futur is a littl more clear.A of thi writing, Will Ashworth did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlace10 Safe Dividend Stock to Own Dure the Next Market Crash10 Danger Dividend Stock to Dump NowTh post3 Way Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Can Reach $500 and Beyondappear first onInvestorPlace."

Tesla (TSLA) to Discontinue Model S 60 Sale from April,3/20/2017,"Tesla, Inc.TSLAha recent mail it custom inform them of the discontinu of the sale of the entri level Model S vehicle, accord to sources. The compani ha decid to remov the Model S 60 and 60D from it lineup. The last day to buy the 60 kWh version ha been set at Apr 16, 2017. Post the date, the entri level Model S sedan will be S 75 and 75D, price $6,500 higher. Late last year, the compani had rais the price of it Model S vehicl by $2,000.A Cheaper Model STesla had introduc Model S 60 and 60D version last year. The cheaper version wa introduc as the compani experienc a higher-than-expect demand for Model 3 as well as immedi demand for a more afford Model S. These version were introduc to boost sale which in turn would encourag the adopt of electr cars. The Model S 60 kWh version ha the same batteri as the 75 kWh version. However, a softwar limit the batteri usag to 80%. Custom have the option to upgrad the batteri to util the entir capac by unlock the softwar for $9,500.Dure the introduct of thi version, Tesla had expect demand for Model S to increas and subsequ the custom would also pay for unlock of the 60 kWh version for the addit 15 kWh. The compani expect gross margin for the sale of the lock version to be 15−20%. However, if custom unlock the software, the margin wa expect to rise to the mid-20% range.Tesla ha claim that most custom who purchas the Model S 60 kWh version unlock the softwar to 75 kWh. To eas the order process for consumers, the compani ha decid to elimin the 60 kWh version. Anoth reason for the remov of the version from the company' vehicl lineup could also be to boost the gross margin if the rate of upgrad fell short of expectations.Model 3 on the CardsTh announc come at a time when Tesla is prepar to begin product of the Model 3, which will be the company' most afford vehicle. The price of the model will be less than half of the new entri level Model S.

FEY stock got a 6%-plu pop as BofA share a ""Buy"" rate and an $18 price target - a whop 70% better than Friday' close.makeArticleAd();Source:David via Flickr (Modified)It' hard to be inspir right now. Bearish ha been right high becaus valuat - rel to futur growth - are unfavorable. Manag shuffl and a light forecast from FEY also suggest that FireEy will have limit upsid for investor in the near-term.But BofA see what I see - that in the long-term, FEY stock could pan out.Th FundamentalsLast month, FireEy report flat (year-over-year) fourth-quart revenu growth of $184.7 million. Oper margin improv to -1%. The compani forecast Q1 revenu of as low as $160 million, while analyst expect FEY would gener $177 million in revenue.8 Place to Run and Hide in a Market CrashTh compani clearli is in a turnaround phase, but until the sale team transit stabilizes, short-term pain in FEY stockwillcontinue.Last quarter, FireEy revenu suffer due to the limit releas of new products. It sale team had vacanc that need filling, leav a massiv gap in leadership. But the compani had no head of sale for the worldwid or Europ divisions. The company' Middl East and Japan unit underw sale manag transitions, too.Th impact on result is veri clear: FireEy did not meet analyst expectations.Investor may anticip sale improv sometim in the next few quarters, depend on the product of the new sale team. Fix the intern sale process will result in better profitability. On it confer call, FEY manag said:W are also work across the board to minim the number of deal that go through our non-standard price process, or NSP process, so partner can control their margin and shorten their sale cycle.FEY ha a believ plan to turn around and restructur it sale division. The problem is simpli one of timing.FireEy ValuationWith the stock price hover near yearli lows, some, if not all, of the risk of a fail turnaround are price into FireEy shares.Bi assum a discount rate of between 11.5%-12.5%, FEY stock is worth 12.5% more than current levels. Conversely, if revenu continu falling, the fair valu base on futur cash flow impli a lower share price. BofA doesn't see that as happening, though.""W think the Street larg ignor management' guidanc for growth resumpt in 2H17, which is an opportun for a posit surprise,"" say analyst Tal Liani.There' headlin support here, too.

Revenu growth is slow at first, but when it pick up, profit soars.Radcom Ltd.(NASDAQ:RDCM), a supplier of qualiti assur solut for the telecom industry, also move toward a subscript model with great success.Bottom Line on FEY StockLast month, rumor thatSymantec Corporation(NASDAQ:SYMC) would buy FireEy prove short-lived.

Furthermore, by remov the upgrad 60 kWh option, Tesla say it will ""simplifi the order process"" for it customers.I Model 3 the real reason?But there' also good reason to believ the discontinu of a 60 kWh Model S could have just as much to do with Tesla' upcom Model 3.

Tesla Inc.'s Capital Expenditures Could Soar Nearly 200% This Year,3/18/2017,"On Thursday, electric-car companyTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) follow through on CEO Elon Musk' recent commentari regard a likelycapit rais to reduc riskassoci with rapidli increas spend for it ambiti growth plans. Tesla said it would raiseabout $1.15 billion.A Tesla rais cash in prepar for a big jump in spending, it' a good time to take a look at how much the company' capit expenditur could go up thi year.Tesla vehicl production. Imag source: Author.makeArticleAd();Big plans, lot of cashIt' no surpris that Tesla need a lot of capital. The compani ha some veri ambiti plan for Model 3. With the help of a higher-volume, lower-pr Model 3, manag expect it annual product to increas from about 100,000 unit today to a whop 500,000 unit in 2018.But exactli how much cash will Tesla need? A lot more than it did last year. Here' what we know.With plan to begin product of it upcom Model 3 in July, Tesla expect capit spend dure the first half of the year to rise sharpli as it lay the groundwork for production. Manag guid for $2 billion to $2.5 billion in capit expenditur in the first half of the year alon -- an amount that easili trump the $1.3 billion it spent dure the entir year of 2016 on capit expenditures.What about the second half of the year? While Tesla didn't provid guidanc for expect capit expenditur then, sinc manag is focus primarili on initi invest requir to get it upcom Model 3 to volum production, Musk did recent impli that Tesla anticip spend to come down dure the second half of the year.Here' what he said dure the fourth-quart earn call:I mean, there' obvious go to be ... increment invest to go from 5,000 car a week to 10,000 car a week, but it' go to be a lot less than get to 5,000 car a week in the first place. We don't know exactli what that' go to be except I'm confid it will be less ...Musk went on to conclud he wouldn't expect capit spend in the second half of the year to exceed 70% of it spend dure the first half. Therefore, assum spend in the second half of the year max out at about 70% of spend dure the first half, investor can arriv at a ballpark estim for Tesla' total capit spend in 2017: approxim $3.825 billion -- up an incred 194% compar to capit expenditur in 2016.Gigafactori and Model 3 are Tesla' biggest investmentsHow will thi spend be allocated?

Tesla Model S Prices Are About to Go Up,3/18/2017,"Follow a $2,000 price bump in November, the price ofTesla's(NASDAQ: TSLA) Model S is about to go up even further. That' becaus the compani is prepar to discontinu the current entry-level 60 kWh model, includ both the single-motor version as well as the dual-motor version that cost an extra $5,000. Tesla ha sent out email notifi custom of the change, andElectrekconfirm the plan with Tesla. The last day that prospect custom can purchas the 60 kWh version will be April 16, 2017.Tesla say it is make the chang becaus most custom subsequ purchas the upgrad to a 75 kWh battery, which is unlock via a softwar update, and the compani is streamlin the order process. Assum no other price changes, the singl motor 75 kWh Model S start at $74,500.Imag source: Tesla.makeArticleAd();Follow in Model X' footstepsTh discontinu of the Model S 60 come shortli after Tesla made similar move with the Model X last year. The electric-car maker introduc a more afford 60 kWh version of it Model X SUV (onli avail in dual motor) in Juli 2016, which wa similarli a 75 kWh batteri pack that wa software-limit to 60 kwh and start at $74,000. That variant didn't last long, as it wa discontinu in Octob 2016, just four month later. Tesla never provid an offici reason. The Model X 75D start at $88,800.The software-limit 60 kWh Model S last a bit longer, as it wa also introduc slightli earlier than the compar Model X, but it appear to be follow in the Model X' footsteps.Whi is Tesla do this?Th software-limit approach ha been controversi from the veri beginning. On one hand, there wa initi backlash at the idea that custom were be needlessli prohibit from access the full batteri capac of a product they had paid for. On the other hand, they paid a lot less for a softwar limit 60 kWh pack.From Tesla' perspective, there wa a certain amount of risk associ with the approach, sinc it wa still includ 75 kWh of capacity, which come at a cost. The hope wa that the lower price point would attract more buyers, who would later upgrade. If the custom is content with 60 kWh and never upgrades, Tesla end up take a meaning hit on margins.On the earn call shortli after the software-limit 60 kWh pack wa introduced, CEO Elon Musk said that most peopl that were buy the base 60 were option up to where averag transact price were ""over $80,000,"" while acknowledg lower margins:Becaus peopl are option up the 60, it actual end up be decent. I mean it' not...mayb it is 15% to 20% gross margin wherea say something, like if somebodi order the perform dual motor, that might actual be more like a 30%, 35% gross margin. But there' just a small number of peopl that want high-perform car and are will to pay tripl digits, or six digit I should say. But it also remain to be seen how mani who order the 60 then choos to do the upgrad to 75 kilowatt hour rate.Ther is go to be some number, it' too earli to tell, of peopl who buy it at 60, realiz they want the extra range, and then they can just order it kind of like an in-app purchas on the car screen and unlock it. I suspect we will see a pretti decent number of peopl do that. But we don't, it is still veri early, so it' hard to say what number that would be. And if they do do that, then it would push gross margin up into the 20 [percent], like mid-20 [percent] or something.For reference, Tesla' adjust automot gross margin last quarter wa 22.2%, which wa down sequenti due to delay Autopilot-rel softwar updates; the compani said it recogn ""almost no new Autopilot-rel revenue"" dure the quarter.Tesla' justif that the move is meant to streamlin order doesn't pass the sniff test. More than likely, the S 60 is be discontinu for financi reasons, if the upgrad rate is lower than Tesla had previous anticipated. A larg concentr of non-upgrad 60 with a 15% to 20% gross margin could put pressur on profitability, while discontinu the option push the margin on those vehicl to the 20% to 25% rang with the potenti downsid of lose some custom who aren't will to pay more.Hopefully, the margin upsid offset ani lost sales.10 stock we like better than TeslaWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Business Model Innovation Will Help Make Make Energy Storage Work,3/18/2017,"Energi storag is come to closer to a realiti for hundr of thousand of residenti energi customers, and we still don't know how compani are go to sell it to them. A batteri system could be purchas or leased, and a custom could make money off it through a revenue-shar program, or some kind of servic model that maxim it valu to customers. If you look back to 2010, when the residenti solar market wa in a similar position, it wa the busi model that separ the winner from the crowd. And it wa compani offer leas to custom on a larg scale who were earli winners.W do know that residenti energi storag is expect to be a multibillion-dollar busi by the end of the decade, we just don't know what busi model will work for energi storag companies. And whoever can get the busi model right will be in a nice posit for investors.Tesla' Powerwal on a home. Imag source: Tesla.makeArticleAd();Th nation instal modelA number of compani are tri to leverag their residenti solar footprint to expand into energi storage.Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) is the largest of these after it acquisit of SolarCity, andSunrun(NASDAQ: RUN) is anoth player worth watching.Tesla' earli Powerwal model were sold directli to custom with the main justif be backup power. But as cost come down and rate structur with demand charg or time-of-us rate becom more common, we'll see more financi justif for energi storage, and new busi model will open up.Nat instal will also like tri to fold energi storag into a long-term energi contract for consumers. Sunrun is do thi with it Brightbox lease, which match it focu on solar leases. Marri the two togeth could keep the leas aliv and give nation instal new life.Th dealer energi storag mode should also note that nation instal are lose market share becaus the leas is quickli lose popularity. I think that will lead to a service-ori dealer model open up.SunPower(NASDAQ: SPWR) is an exampl of a compani who use dealers, provid equip and services, but lean on the dealer to complet sale and perform installations.In energi storage, SunPow may provid a pre-engin solut that plug directli into it solar system as well as financ and some sort of value-gener model. A custom may buy the energi storag system and then share the revenu gener with SunPower. It may leas and share value, similar to the nation instal model I outlin above. Or it may just sell the system and provid the algorithm that control the system for a fee.Th third-parti energi storag modelOn grow model is have energi storag as a stand-alon service, not tie to a solar system' financing. Sonnen is one of the industri leader in Germany, where energi storag ha been viabl for year now, and is move quickli to grow in the U.S. as well. In total, the compani ha instal over 10,000 energi storag system around the world.Sonnen' system is design to work with a solar system in the U.S., but it wouldn't necessarili have to be combin with solar. Sonnen can even aggreg excess energi from a commun energi program, effect creat an energi share program.Buy solar and energi storag separ is what' normal done in commerci solar, with compani like Stem take the lead on energi storag and onli have an adjac involv with solar. Thi model could potenti make sens as a busi model in the residenti market as well, although it would be a harder sell than marri up with a solar system.What we know energi storag needsYou may notic that all of the model I outlin abov have a larg compani behind the scene pull the strings, and that' important. A small compani doesn't have the scale to build the algorithm need to know when charg and discharg an energi storag system would gener the most value. And in differ state and area under differ util with differ rate structures, the decision-mak process would be different. Compani need scale and the abil to control thousand of energi storag system to aggreg the value.Whil big player may be power broker behind the scenes, it' still not clear how the model will interact with customers. The solar market is move toward more cash and loan sale and away from leas from nation installers, so that' worth keep in mind if energi storag is tie directli to solar. But the need for a larg compani to gener valu from energi storag may pull larg compani back into the mix, whether that' manufacturers, or on the instal side.Whoev can get thi formula right will have a huge market ahead of them. And the energi storag market is come quickli and may open up a lot faster than investor think.10 stock we like better than TeslaWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

And NVDA wa right.Now, the market cap for NVDA stock is bigger than all but the biggest player in the market - INTC andTexa Instrument Incorporated(NASDAQ:TXN).

(AAPL) Stock Need to Make ANi Wave From HereI wrote about NVDA last monthaft it fall from it lofti height around $120 per share, and now it look like the momentum is now behind the stock again, as predicted.Don't let it price-to-earn ratio of 41 deter you. Nvidia' growth almost make that a reason valuation, and even if it' slightli expensive, it' less of a premium than you see on mani stock with a lot less growth potential.With a market lead posit in the biggest trend in comput - big data, virtual reality, augment reality, internet of things, smart car and other devic - NVDA is in the catbird seat.

Better Buy: Tesla vs. BMW,3/17/2017,"In the high-end perform segment of the auto industry,Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) andBMW(NASDAQOTH: BAMXF) are two of the best brand and most innov manufactur in the world. BMW ha long been an aspir brand focus on high perform with a level of luxuri that consum demand when spend upward of $100,000 on a vehicle. Tesla is break all of the rule of the auto industri and is grow it fleet of electr vehicles.But investor have to balanc growth with perform and valu in a stock. And with BMW and Tesla, those factor collid amid a passion debat about the futur of the auto industry.Th electr BMW i3. Imag source: BMW.makeArticleAd();Th known commodityBMW is the better-known compani of these two, have sold 2.37 million vehicl in 2016 and gener 6.9 billion euro in net incom for the year. It EBIT (earn befor interest and taxes) margin of 8.9% is among the industry' best, and manag ha guid for 8% to 10% EBIT margin through 2020.What BMW bring from a manufactur and qualiti standpoint is extrem valuable, even though those are less tangibl factor than financi results. The compani ha decad of manufactur expertis and ha been abl to gener strong margin while stay at the forefront of new technolog like carbon fiber, autonom driving, and electr vehicl (EVs). It' even launch a ride-shar product in Seattle, with Portland (Oregon) and Brooklyn expect to follow.Th advantag investor have with BMW is know that it can execut on it automot manufactur plan and have confid in it abil to follow industri trend where they'r headed. With EV clearli grow as a percentag of auto sale around the world, BMW can learn and adapt to where the market is going. But it'll be abl to follow upstart like Tesla as they grow the market rather than be on the bleed edg of a new industry.Tesla' Model S with the first Powerwall. Imag source: Tesla.Th upstart with a lot of unknown aheadTesla ha gotten the most attent of ani EV company, and for good reason. It' push the envelope, and it EV-onli busi model seem to be the most effect way to build a viabl EV brand. And with energi storag and solar power under it wing, the compani ha broad and divers exposur to renew energy.Al of that growth come at a cost, though, with Tesla spend $1.28 billion on capit expenditur in 2016. Goldman Sach recent predict that 2017 capit expenditur would be $3 billion to build out capac to build the Model 3 and ramp up to capac for 500,000 vehicl in 2018. Plus, the compani need to fund raw materi for build out the Model 3.The allur of growth is intoxicating, but it come at high risk as well. Analyst alreadi expect Tesla will need to rais capit in come month to fund it growth plans. And the compani certainli need to improv qualiti and it part suppli chain just to match competitor (for evid of this, read fellow Fool Evan Niu' saga abouttri to get hi Model S repaired). Improv manufactur qualiti and build out an intern part suppli chain is no small task, and it' someth Tesla ha never done, so it' an unknown for the compani and leav a lot of uncertainti for investors.Tesla' product are well like by earli adopters, but still haven't been test by the masses. While BMW sold over 2 million vehicl last year, Tesla ha onli sold about one-tenth that figur in it nearli 14-year history. Translat hype to oper success could prove harder than Tesla can handle.Whi it' hard to pay up for potenti in the auto industryGiven the unknown face Tesla, it' hard to justifi pay 10 time the price-to-sal ratio investor are get with BMW. And keep in mind that Tesla would have had to increas deliveri by 31 time just to match BMW in 2016.BAMXF Market Capdata byYCharts.Mayb the more fundament question is whether or not the auto industry, and big player like BMW, will be abl to adapt to Tesla if the latter' success continues. And I'll point out that progress in the auto industri is extrem slow. Tesla seem like an upstart, but it' nearli 14 year old and is still make fewer than 100,000 vehicl per year. That' not much of a track record, no matter how good the company' brand is, and I think automak will quickli be abl to catch Tesla in the EV market.Th fact that investor have to pay a massiv premium to own Tesla' share is the main reason I think BMW is the better stock to own today. There' more stability, a longer track record, and we know BMW can be a world-class manufactur -- someth Tesla still hasn't proven to investors.10 stock we like better than BMWWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Why Are Chipmakers So Interested in Autonomous Cars?,3/16/2017,"It' the same reason that automak are interest in the market. Although for them, it' also a question of prevent tech compani from encroach on their turf. There doesn't seem to be ani likelihood of such encroach however, at least in the near future, as there is too much to make a car that' just too far from what tech compani do best. So the first fully-autonom car that make it to the market will most like be a collabor effort between auto maker and tech companies.Th primari sell point for self-driv car is increas safeti due to fewer accidents. There ha been some research suggest that when comput take over the roads, they will remov the chanc of accid due to human error (for sleep, distraction, intoxication, carelessness, brake failur or other mechan problems, or when it' the other guy' fault, or ani other reason). And of cours thi is what is broadli propound by the compani invest in the phenomenon. Kathi Winter, the VP and gener manag of the autom drive divis at IntelINTCthink that it will also help creat logist solut for transport and deliveri of products.But don't expect a sudden jump from driven to driverless cars. It' more like that car will increasingli incorpor featur that autom certain function over time, make them semi-autom to vari degrees. Regulatori and insur consider will also like requir the presenc of a driver long after car becom fully-automated.Th Institut of Transport Studi at Univers of California, recent conduct a survey of forti expert includ policymakers, researchers, govern representatives, nonprofit organ and tech companies, present the result in a report titl ""3 Revolutions: Sharing, Electrification, and Automation."" The chief find were as follows:70% of survey particip think fulli driverless vehicl will account for more than 20% of vehicl sold by 2040.88% think commerci offer share ride will make up more than 5% of all U.S. passeng mile by 2030, and 78% think commerci offer share ride will account for more than 20% of U.S. passeng mile travel by 2040.70% also think that by 2050, the major of vehicl use commerci for ride and car share in the nation will be zero emiss vehicles, includ battery, plug-in hybrid, and fuel-cel electr vehicles.Accord to IH Automot forecasts, sever thousand autonom vehicl will be on U.S. road in 2020, with the number grow to nearli 4.5 million vehicl by 2035. By then, there will be 21 million autonom vehicl on the road globally, grow at a 43% CAGR from 2025 to 2035.No wonder everyon is excited.What' In It For Chipmakers?Both Intel and NVIDIANVDAsay that the fulli autom car will have as much electron horsepow as a super computer.Wheth a lidar or radar system is use to pick up imag of the area surround the car, the system is base on semiconductors. These imag have to be process and match with relev data to decid a cours of action at the blink of an eye. So there' process (analog, logic), commun and machin learn involved. Each of these oper will be facilit with semiconductors. Plu there' entertainment, display and sync with other devic that will also requir semiconductors.Key PlayersTh Intel Go comput and NVIDIA Drive PX 2 are design to help car detect pedestrians, objects, lanes, respond to traffic signals, etc. BMW is test the Intel solut while TeslaTSLAi test the NVIDIA solution. BaiduBIDUi develop an artifici intellig platform that combin it cloud platform with NVIDIA self-driv technolog to deliv thing like HD maps, vehicl control, autom parking, etc for the Chines market.NVIDIA ha a lead in the machin learn segment and it automot chip are alreadi in million of car from a number of suppliers, which in combination, give it an edg in the autom car segment.Intel ha been in collabor with Mobiley for quit a while and ha final announc that it will buy the Isra supplier of self-driv technolog (camera and laser-bas sensors) for $15 billion. Mobiley current sell it technolog to 27 automak across the world, so the combin will be highli advantag for Intel.QualcommQCOM, which beat Intel hand down in the mobil comput business, is also set to rule in self-driv car (although thi time, competit will be tough with both Intel and NVIDIA have gain some mileage). The compani recent launch it Drive Data Platform, which is it version of a self-driv system to process the sensor input gener by a vehicle. The system is base on the Snapdragon 820Am and make use of the Snapdragon Neural Process Engin (SNPE).But there' more. Qualcomm' soon-to-be-complet acquisit of NXP Semiconductor in an all-cash deal worth $47 billion bring on board NXP' RF SoC for in-vehicl infotain (IVI) systems. While IVI may not sound that excit in the context of self-driv cars, the thing to bear in mind in thi case is the SoC technolog that will shrink the size of high power system while lower the cost.Thi will be quit a breakthrough for Qualcomm as a lower price will speed up adopt of it systems. Additionally, NXP is the biggest supplier of automot chip worldwid so it ha the necessari relationship to jumpstart it business.AlphabetGOOGLha develop self-driv technolog of it own but it compon supplier aren't known. Back in 2015, the compani quietli acquir Lumedyne, a maker of micro-electromechan system (MEMS) sensor includ an optic accelerometer, a vibrat energi harvest and a ""Time Domain Switched"" type of inerti sensor for $85 million. Lumedyn also had a number of patent pend approv at the time.Ov the years, Googl ha also been hire a grow number of peopl with chip design skills. In 2015 itself, Google' Pixel team advertis an open for a ""multimedia chip architect"" who can ""lead a chip develop effort"" and ""work with other engin to take chip to product shipment"". Googl wa particularli look for expertis in ""imag processing, video processing, stabilization."" The Pixel still use NVIDIA chips, but Googl doe have intern develop self-driv technolog and the greatest number of self-driv mile on record to train it self-driv system.Wrap UpTh self-driving/autonom car convers is just get started. There will no doubt be much innov in the space over the next few years, both by the biggest tech player and automak and by smaller startups. In fact, CB Insight estim that financ in the auto tech startup sector wa over $1 billion in 2016 and more money will sure follow. Thi is one of the best place to be in becaus the technolog is just be built, so it could be good business. Also, earli investor can sell out their interest at a nice premium.For chipmak it' a rush to grab a share of the pie.Mor Stock News: 8 Compani Verg on Apple-Lik RunDid you miss Apple' 9X stock explos after they launch their iPhon in 2007?

Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Holders Might Have a Painful Wait,3/16/2017,"InvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsAppl Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) ha taken a bit of a breather thi month after a terrif run. Appl stock gain 30% just between Novemb and earli March, and is up over 50% from late June levels.makeArticleAd();Th latter run, incredibly, ha ad about $250 billion to the market valu of AAPL stock.Part of the gain have come from the fact that AAPL wa just too cheap, particularli below $100 thi summer. But optim toward the iPhon 8 ha boost hope that Appl stock can jump-start growth. (The issu at key competitorSamsung Electronics(OTCMKTS:SSNLF), includ theGalaxi Note 7 debacle, like have help as well.)So the question now for AAPL is when the iPhon 8 is come - and how much upsid might be left from a success launch and product cycle.For now, it look like there' still some gain left for Appl stock … but investor might need to have some patience.Wil the iPhon 8 Move Appl Stock?At the moment, it appear the iPhon 8 will be launch thi fall, accord to variou reports. But Appl ha said littl about the launch, leav a guess game for observ and investors. Even the name isn't clear: The next phone seem like to be call the iPhon 8, not the 7S, but that' not assur at the moment.Most observ are expect an iPhon 8, rather than a 7S, becaus the next-gen product will have major changes. The most notabl wa thought to be a curv OLE screen, but those report have been question of late. Iri recognition, facial scanning, and a larger screen (on a phone of similar dimensions) are all expect to be featur of variou version of the phone.7 Dividend Stock With Yield That Grow Like WeedsWhat might be most interest for Appl stock is the price. On Monday morning, Instinet analyst Jeffrey Kvaal said supplier price support a possibl $1,000 price for the new iPhone. Other report of a high-end""Edition""hav specul an ASP over $1,200. Higher price for iPhon mean higher margin for Appl - and like a higher multipl for AAPL stock.Wil Investor Buy the Leak and Sell the News?Th biggest worri ahead of the launch is if there will be a ""buy the rumor, sell the news"" reaction from investors.It is clear that some of the optim over the past few months, in particular, ha been driven by consum reaction to the leak spec for the new iPhone. Indeed, Appl stock tradit ha been movedalmost sole by iPhon sentiment. Sale of other product have been pretti much flat the last four years.So if there is a larg base of investor bid up the Appl stock price ahead of the iPhon 8, the question then becomes: What might happen in Septemb when the product actual is released?Th higher expect get now, the greater the chanc of a disappoint later. Everi aspect of the new product will be dissect - and ani rumor spec (like, say, the $1,000 price tag) that aren't in the iPhon 8 will be consid a ""miss"" by Apple.What' Left for the iPhon 8?With Appl stock back near an all-tim high, that possibl would concern me over the next few months. For investor with a longer-term focus, however, there' still reason to see upsid in AAPL off the iPhon 8 launch.Again, AAPL stock gener ha match up well with iPhon product cycles, and that should keep the stock move upward if the launch and subsequ sale are a success.Th Tesla Inc (TSLA) Small SUV Ha Big ImplicationsMeanwhile, a big hit with the new iPhon could onc again separ Appl from Samsung. It would also differenti iO fromAlphabet Inc's(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Android ecosystem more broadly. That in turn might allow AAPL stock to onc again receiv a growth multiple, instead of the low-double-digit-plu cash earn multipl at which it current trades.In either direction, the iPhon 8 will matter, becaus the iPhon still is the major profit engin for Apple. Roughli 63% of fiscal 2016 sale came from the iPhon - and given margins, possibl a higher portion of profits. Appl need a winner in the iPhon 8 to drive Appl stock higher. And while earli specul look like the iPhon 8 will be a hit, the recent run in AAPL stock may have price in at least some of that success.Investor hope for more like will need to wait for Septemb - and hope Appl ha onc again deliv on it promise.Th author ha no posit in ani secur mentioned.Mor From InvestorPlaceHow GoPro Inc (GPRO) Stock Could Make a ComebackDo the Snap Inc (SNAP) Debacl Signal Doom for These Unicorns?Interest Rate are Rise -- Is Advanc Micro Devices, Inc.

Investing in EV Infrastructure: Where the Money Is Going,3/15/2017,"Last year, 159,139 electr vehicl were sold in the U.S., accord toInsid EVs, but that' just scratch the surfac of the industry' potential.Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) plan to build 500,000 EV in 2018 andGeneralMotors(NYSE: GM) just launch it first big bet on EV in the Chevi Bolt, which will test the size of the market. With new car fromNissan, Porsche,VW, Volvo, and mani others, there look to be an EV boom on the horizon. But the size of that boom is current unknown.Th U.S. Energi Inform Administr (which typic underestim new technologies) predict that annual EV and plug-in EV sale will be 1.3 million by 2025 and that 7.5 million EV will be on the road by then. Meanwhile, GTM Research estim that a total of 11.4 million EV will be on the road in the U.S. by 2025 and Bloomberg New Energi Financ think 35% of all new vehicl sold in 2040 will be electric.W know that the EV market will be big and that, given the scale of the number abov and the speed of growth, EV charg infrastructur will becom increasingli import across the country. That present an opportun for the compani build out these charg capabilities.makeArticleAd();Imag source: Getti Images.Th charger themselv could be big businessA EV becom more common, someon ha to provid million of charger for person and public use.Aerovironment(NASDAQ: AVAV) ha taken a lead posit in the charger market with partnership with Volvo, Nissan,Ford, and others. The compani ha also releasedcharg plansand session price for Level 2 (12-26 mile of charg per hour) and fast charg (40 mile of charg in 10 minutes) on the West Coast, where it is build out a network. In it most recent quarter, electr charg product sale jump 74% to $11.3 million, a small but grow base for a small compani to build on.Gener Electric(NYSE: GE) is also move into the market, sell home charger and public charg options. As it' a major electr compon supplier, thi is an adjac market it can enter with littl risk, and I would expect to see GE' charger revenu grow as the market grows.Of course, there' Tesla' charg infrastructur as well. Tesla sell most of it own charg compon to customers, and as it' the biggest EV company, it' a big business. But the proprietari charg technolog it ha bet on may end up eventu wall it off from competitors.How charger get builtWhat' less known is who will build the charger infrastructur and how it will be paid for. Tesla' Supercharg network ha been built out entir by Tesla for the use of it own customers. It' been free for years, but now new Model S and Model X custom will get 400 kWh of supercharg free and then pay a fee for charg base on local electr costs. Compet auto manufactur haven't shown much interest in build out their own network and will most like let someon els build chargers.Imag source: Getti Images.Util have shown some interest in charger be a growth opportunity. In California,San Diego Ga & Electrici build 3,500 utility-own charger for $45 million,Southern California Edisoni build 1,500 host-own charger for $22 million, andPacif Ga & Electrici build the infrastructur behind 7,500 charger in a utility-priv investor partnership. The question here is whether or not util should be abl to build charger under their monopoli power and therefor rate-bas the cost to all consumers, whether they own an electr vehicl or not. In theory, a utility' low cost of capit could help build out charger network more quickly, although keep util out of the market may bring in more innov busi model from privat companies.Th third option is third-parti charg networks.NRG Energy(NYSE: NRG) tri to get into thi busi but sold off EVgo earlier thi year to an invest firm that may be abl to grow the network more effectively. The nation network now countsBMW, Ford, and Nissan as partners, and it earli mover statu may be help long term. ChargePoint is the nation' largest charg network, aggreg local EV charg station into a nation network. Blink is anoth compani build a larg network, which is current about 4,000 stations.EV charg will be big but still face risksWhat' uniqu here is that there are three distinct busi model collid in EV charging, and we don't know which one will win long term. My money would be on third-parti network eventu becom victori becaus of their nation scope and abil to provid differ charg technologies. And if they do, these (mostli private) network and the compani that build the charger will be the big winner for investors.What we do know is that with million of EV expect to hit the road in the next decade, thi is a big opportun for compani that can get their busi model right.10 stock we like better than Wal-MartWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Buy Facebook Inc (FB) Stock as It Steals Snap Inc’s (SNAP) Thunder,3/15/2017,"InvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsTh cat is out of the bag.Facebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) is copyingSnap Inc(NYSE:SNAP), and it is do it everywhere.makeArticleAd();First, it wa Instagram Stories. Then it wa WhatsApp Status. Now it' Messeng Day. With each copycat iteration, the choru of bearish argument against FB stock get louder and louder. They are all pretti similar, and they go someth like: ""Facebook is play catch-up"" or ""Facebook isn't innovating"" or ""Snap will steal Facebook' users.""Th market doesn't seem to be give those argument much credence. Facebook stock is up 13% sinc Instagram Stori launch and is current at all-tim highs. SNAP stock, meanwhile, is 25% off it post-IPO high and continu to make new lows.I think the market ha it right on thi one. Here' why.Facebook Stole Snap' ThunderOn thingAppl Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) taught the technolog world is that you don't need to be first to market to succeed. The iPhon wa far from the first smartphon to market. Appl let other compani introduc the concept and dabbl in prototypes, then Appl leap on the opportun when the time wa right.6 Tech Stock to Buy for the VR BoomIn other words, you don't have to be first. You just have to be better and have the right timing.Facebook is bigger, and in the social media world, that is better. The time is also right for Facebook to be play copycat.Scal is what ha driven profit and driven FB stock higher. The entir Facebook ecosystem ha tremend scale. The main Facebook app ha scale. Messeng ha scale. Instagram ha scale. WhatsApp ha scale. Thi pervas scale offer two advantages:Firstly, scale will convert Snap Stori user into Facebook users. As thisMashablewriterpoint out, there is a certain broadcast element to Snap and Instagram Stories. When you blast a pictur or video out on social media for 24 hours, you do so with the intent of grab as mani eyebal as possible. Snap onli ha so mani eyeballs. Instagram ha more than two time as mani eyeballs. Messeng ha more than six times, and WhatsApp more than seven times.Secondly, scale will allow FB to grab user befor they ever even migrat to Snap. Instagram Stori just roll out internationally, where Snap onli ha some 90 million daili activ users. Messeng and WhatsApp also have larg intern reach. As Instagram Stories, WhatsApp Status, and Messeng Day launch globally, it will be the first time mani of their user have seen the ""Stories"" concept. To them, there is no copi or mimick at work. Just a cool new featur on a favorit platform.Th time of Facebook' ""imit game"" ha also been pretti close to perfect.Th concept of ephemer media messaging, particularli the core concept of Stories, realli took off in 2016. Snap saw it daili activ user base grow from 107 million at the end of 2015 to 143 million by the middl of 2016.But then Instagram Stori launch in August 2016, and Snap' user growth slowed. Snap end the year with onli 158 million daili actives. That mean the platform ad 36 million user in the first half of 2016 but onli 15 million in the second-half.Meanwhile, in just 25 weeks, Instagram Stori grew to150 million actives(th same size as Snap).What Will Appl Inc. (AAPL) Show Off in It April Event?It look like Instagram stole Snap' thunder in August, and roll with it into the end of the year while Snap more or less flat-lined.Bottom Line on FB StockFacebook is play copycat, and so far, it' working. Moreover, it like will continu to work, and FB will onli grow it user base and unit revenu as Snap fade into social media memory.Al in all, FB stock ha becom a classic ""buy-the-dip"" situat with a secular growth stori and a reason - but not great - valuation. At nearli 21 time next year' consensu earn estimate, Facebook realli isn't all the expensive. Earn are actual expect to grow 28% thi year and 23% next year, so the stock trade at a discount to it growth. That is rare for a hyper-growth tech company.Facebook also ha more than $10 per share in cash on the balanc sheet and gener consist strong cash flows.For what it' worth, I'm not run to buy FB stock here near all-tim highs. But Iamlook to add to my posit on ani dips.A of the write of thi article, Luke Lango wa long FB.More From InvestorPlaceTesla Inc (TSLA) Stock: How ""Model Y"" Report Chang the Game3 Stock to Watch on Wednesday: Bank of America Corp (BAC), Arena Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

Tesla's Model 3 Reservation Count Likely Hasn't Changed Much,3/14/2017,"It' now been nearli a year sinceTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) provid it one and onli disclosur on how mani Model 3 reserv it ha collected. When Tesla conduct it secondari offer last year, it confirm that in the month and a half follow the Model 3 unveil it had garner 373,000 reserv as of May 15, 2016. Sinc then, numer analyst have ask for updat on thi figure, which manag ha declin to answer for fear that ani updat would be needlessli overscrutinized.Ther are onli clues, but it look like Tesla' total Model 3 reserv talli hasn't chang much over the past year.Imag source: Tesla.makeArticleAd();Norm fluctuationsTh balanc sheet line item to look at is custom deposits. Thi figur natur fluctuat as custom place deposit for new vehicles, which are subsequ releas when the vehicl is delivered. Throughout 2014 and 2015, these fluctuat were often in the $20 million to $30 million range.At $1,000 per reservation, the aforement 373,000 figur from last year repres $373 million worth of deposits. Due to the time of the unveil last year, which occur on the veri last day of Q1 2016, not all deposit taken on March 31 were captur in the correspond balanc sheet data due to credit card and bank process times. In other words, that $373 million increas in deposit took place over two quarter in term of balanc sheet dates.Data source: SEC filings. Chart by author.Th differ between deposit on Dec. 31, 2015, and June 30, 2016, wa $396.5 million, or that same $373 million and then some within rang of standard fluctuations. But sinc then, custom deposit have not chang meaning beyond what would be consid standard fluctuations. More specifically, CFO Jason Wheeler attribut last quarter' sequenti declin of $27 million to a larg number of Model X Signatur Seri that were delivered, which origin had higher deposits.Thi suggest that Tesla' total Model 3 reserv talli ha not chang much.That' not necessarili a bad thingTo be clear, thi is not necessarili a bad thing. Wheeler note that Tesla doe not ""want to make the line longer at thi point,"" and CEO Elon Musk said the compani ""anti-sells"" the Model 3 for thi reason. So the compani is not activ tri to grow the Model 3 line, and the first year' worth of product is alreadi effect alloc to current reserv holders; Tesla' site say new reserv won't deliv until ""mid 2018 or later.""Th initi spike in reserv wa certainli driven by pent-up demand from enthusiast consum that have long want a Tesla but have been wait for a more afford option. For consum that are consid a wider rang of brand for their next vehicl purchase, there' littl to no point in place a $1,000 deposit for a vehicl that won't be deliv for anoth year or longer. It' easier to sit on the sidelin and see how thing play out, and see if Tesla can execut better in area like qualiti control and custom support.A longer line is also meaningless to Tesla if it' alreadi backlog by over a year, and it main focu is ramp product and address ani earli issu that aris (which is whi the first deliveri will go to employe in the Bay Area, close to the Fremont factory). There would veri like be a tendenc among critic to spin a rel unchang reserv count as a neg storyline, which may be what manag is tri to avoid by not give updates.What matter most for the time be is just get the $35,000 electr vehicl out there.10 stock we like better than TeslaWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

NVIDIA or Intel: Which Is Better for Driverless Car Investors?,3/14/2017,"Self-driv cars, onc the stuff of scienc fiction movies, are set to becom a realiti soon. Alreadi mani driver-assist features, such as lane changing, traffic jam assist and others, are be offer by automakers. Such featur are, essentially, step stone to autonom drive technology.Bi definition, an autonom vehicl is a car that is abl to take on the primari transport capabl of a driver-control car. It can sens it surround environ and navig that space without the involv of humans. Technolog like radar, lidar, GP and comput vision help the car accomplish thi feat.Nearli all automak are now in variou stage of develop self-driv cars. Some have even start test them on public roads. Although bring these car to market will take years, it is obviou that driverless car have a place in the futur of the technolog industry. Thus, long-term investor interest in the technolog sector would be well-advis to invest in stock that look set to gain from thi trend. Sinc the market is domin by a few larg players, it make sens to weigh the pro and con befor investing.Hug Growth Potenti of the IndustryAccord to data avail from BI intelligence, 10 million self-driv car will be on the road by 2020. Per Statista, the market for fulli autonom vehicl will grow to almost $6 billion while partial autonom vehicl market will reach $36 billion by 2025. Accord to Boston Consult Group estimates, the autonom car market will be worth $42 billion by 2025 and $77 billion by 2035.These estim encourag us about NVIDIA Corp.NVDAand Intel Corp's.INTCgrowth prospect in the space. With it sustain focu on develop new and more advanc technolog for self-div cars, we believ that the two compani is well pois to capit on thi opportunity. Both these compani have gener high return for investor so far and have the potenti to exceed expect in the day ahead.NVIDIA Vs. IntelNVIDIA and Intel are two big player within the driverless car space.Intel recent struck a deal to acquir driver assist technolog compani Mobiley N.V.MBLYfor roughli $15.3 billion. The deal mark the next step in the driverless car race.Intel plan on integr it own autom drive group with Mobileye' renown operations, and the combin entiti will be run by Mobiley Chairman Amnon Shashua. The deal will combin Intel' processor with Mobileye' renown comput vision, make it the biggest purchas of a compani that' sole focus on the self-driv market.Intel' $15.3 billion acquisit is the biggest ever for an Isra technolog company. The move posit Intel as a ""lead technolog provid in the fast-grow market for highli and fulli autonom vehicles,"" accord to a compani statement Monday. ""Intel estim the vehicl systems, data and servic market opportun to be up to $70 billion by 2030.""The deal come afterMobiley partneredwith self-driv technolog compani Delphi Automot in Aug. 2016. The two compani plan to creat an afford self-driv car platform to sell to carmak by 2019. In Nov. 2016,Intel announcedthat Mobiley and Delphi would use it processors. Intel, Mobiley and German automak BMW AG partner to test 40 self-driv cars, which could possibl lead to product by 2021.Intel' purchas help the technolog giant begin to compet in therac toward autonom car technology.In January, Intel announc it would purchas a 15% stake in digit mapmak Here Intern B.V., join BMW AG and Volkswagen AG'sVLKAYAudi, to further the develop in the real-tim technolog need to improv self-driv car technology.With these type of partnership in mind, Intel and Mobileye' biggest competitor go forward will be NVIDIA and it collabor with Tesla Inc.TSLA. NVIDIA is best known for it game and smartphon graphic chips, but like Intel, the compani ha been develop comput hardwar for cars.NVIDIA' foray into the autonom vehicl and other automot electron space ha also been drive the stock higher sinc mid-2015. It should be note that dure the last report quarter (fourth quarter of fiscal 2017), the compani wit a 38% year-over-year jump in automot segment revenues, mainli driven by premium infotain and digit cockpit featur in mainstream cars.Notably, dure the 2017 CE event, the compani announc two import collabor - with HERE and ZENRIN - that will expand the Live Map capabl of autonom vehicl Apart from this, the compani announc an extens of it decade-long partnership with Audi. The two compani have now decid to put advanc AI car on the road start 2020.It should be note that NVIDIA foray into autonom vehicl and other automot electron space in 2015 by launch a comput vision system at the CES. It hasn't look back sinc then and ha been continu bring new and more advanc technolog in the space.At the begin of 2016, NVIDIA launch DRIVE PX 2 - the world' most power engin for in-vehicl AI. In Sep 2016, the graphic chip behemoth unveil a new AI supercomput chip design for self-driv car call Xavier at it GPU Technolog Confer (GTC) in Amsterdam. With it sustain focu on develop new and more advanc AI technolog for self-div cars, we believ that the compani is well pois to becom a lead provid of technolog for autonom vehicles.Notably, sinc 2015, NVIDIA ha been provid variou autonom technolog such as digit instrument clusters, navigation, advanc driver-assist system and infotain under it partnership with sever automak includ HondaHMC, Tesla Motors, Audi, Volvo, Mercedes-Benz and BMW.Therefore, we believ that the recent permit to test it driverless car will encourag variou other auto manufactur to use NVIDIA' process unit in their autonom drive systems.For years, these two compani have battl each other for market share and brand recognit in everi conceiv way.Which Stock to Choose?Shar priceNVIDIA, a Zack Rank #3 (Hold) stock, remain one of the best perform in the semiconductor space. The stock ha been clock solid return sinc the begin of 2016 and ha gain 216.9% in the last one year, outperform the Zack categorizedSemiconductor-Generalindustry' return of just about 39.9%.We note that Intel, a Zack Rank #3 (Hold) stock, ha underperform the ZacksSemiconductor Generalindustri in the past one year. While the company' share gain 10.9%, the industri return 38.9% in the same period. Moreover, we don't expect the share to rebound in the near term.Estim RevisionsOv the past month, NVIDIA' current quarter estim have risen from 63 cent per share to 67 cent per share and current year estim have risen from $2.69 per share to $2.79 per share.Whil Intel' current quarter estim over the past one month have not shown ani movement and is peg at 65 cents. However, current year estim have risen from $2.79 per share to $2.89 per share, over the same time frame.Styl Score, EP Growth Rate, Market CapNVIDIA ha a Growth Style Score of ""A"" with a long-term expect growth rate of 10.3%. The compani ha a market cap of $58.38 billion.Intel ha a Growth Style Score of ""B"" with a long-term expect growth rate of 8.42%. The compani ha a market cap of $169.78 billion.ConclusionThes two stock have grab the spotlight with strike perform on the back of solid earn result and strong growth projections, with their share of pro and cons. But given the current scenario, we would bet on NVIDIA becaus it is well-posit to outpac the industri and is fundament strong enough to withstand risks.

Better for Intel to shape it on it term then end up chase the lead pace set by the like ofTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) andNvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA).He' also right in the sens that by 2020/2021, the landscap of the self-driv car market is go to look radic different. Not onli will the market leader be well-entrench by then, there' go to massiv growth in the number of autonom car on the road by that time.How massive? BCG recent crunch some numbers, conclud thatbi 2035 annual sale of fulli autonom vehicl will reach 12 million. Annual sale of partially-autonom car will rise to 18 million by that point.Investor won't have to wait that long to see big-tim growth, though. BCG think the market will be worth $42 billion by 2025, and grow to $77 billion by 2035. At the end of the timeframe, roughli a fourth of all new car sold will offer autonom drive features.In a separ study, Lux Research conclud that,bi 2030, the self-driv automobil market will be worth $87 billion. Lux ad that softwar develop will be the biggest winner of the movement. Make the hardwar work is the hard part.With Mobiley now under it wing, Intel ha access to a full-blown platform - complet with softwar - it didn't have before.Bottom Line for INTC StockIt' not a deal that' go to pay dividend (liter or figuratively) tomorrow, or even next year. Give it two years, though, or even five year for the autonom car market to mature. It' coming, and it' go to be big. It' far easier and far more afford for Intel to stake it claim now than it will be to tri and break into the market later.Tesla: Trade TSLA With Less RiskIf noth else, Intel want to make sure it made Mobiley it own rather than risk let a competitor get hold of the up-and-com company. The valu will be there eventually.A of thi writing, Jame Brumley did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlace10 Monthli Dividend Stock to Buy to Pay the Bills7 Huge M&A Deal That Should Happen ImmediatelyTh postMobiley NV (MBLY) Didn't Come Cheap.

"Can Intel Catch Tesla, Google, Apple In Autonomous Car Race?",3/14/2017,"Thank to its$15.3 billion acquisitionof Isra self-driv technolog compani Mobiley (MBLY), Intel (INTC) is no longer on the outsid look in when it come to the autonom car market, which ha becom the new battleground for high-tech compani look new revenu streams.Whil Intel’ semiconductor prowess and breadth in R&D should acceler the pace of Mobileye’ technolog innovation, will the combin compani have enough tread to catch the like of Tesla (TSLA) and Googl (GOOGL)?Intel seem to think so. The deal, which sent MBLi stock soar 28% in activ trade Monday, ""merg the intellig eye of the autonom car with the intellig brain that actual drive the car,” said Intel CEO Brian Krzanich in a statement. “The say 'what' under the hood' will increasingli refer to computing, not horsepower.”makeArticleAd();Investor weren’t immedi impressed, send Intel share down 2.1% to close at a three-month low of $35.16. Thi isn’t Intel’ first run at self-driv cars, however. The Santa Clara, Calif.-bas chip giant, through it financ arm Intel Capital, hasspent $250 millionin R&D look for an edge. The Mobiley deal, meanwhile, ha now made it known that autonom drive capabl wa never a hobbi for Intel. It’ becom a critic market for the company.Still, Tesla and Googl won’t be run off the road. In December, GooglelaunchedWaymo, which stand for “a new way forward in mobility.” Waymo’ websit featur a two-seat prototyp fit with Google’ hardwar and softwar that is built to move with the touch of a button, with neither a steer wheel nor a brake pedal. Meanwhile, in Tesla’ most popular sedan, the Model S, the compani ha alreadi roll out self-driv capabl that receiv increment updat on autopilot features.Thes updates, which includ “exit ramp autonomy” on highways, automat lane-changing, and auto-steering, are also avail to Model X, it SUV family. And to say noth about Apple’ (AAPL) own autonom car ambitions, which theWal Street Journalrec confirmed. With more money stash than the U.S. Treasury, Apple’ autonom car posit depend onli on how hard it want to mash the accelerator.But here’ the thing: Mobiley wa onc a promin partner to Tesla, mean it could have had first-hand knowledg of what Tesla ha under it hood. And to the extent Intel can util that knowledg to acceler it own technology, Intel will narrow that gap rel quickly.At the same time, the fact that Intel want to emerg as the go-to chip name when it come to autonom car processors, power function such as display and commun between two self-driv vehicles, Intel doesn’t necessarili have to be the car, it can just be the brainsinsideth car — someth it thrive on dure the height of the PC era."

1 Chart That Suggests Tesla Needs to Invest More in Support Infrastructure,3/14/2017,"Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) ha an ambiti and compel vision of vertic integr sale and service. Hatr of the tradit car buy experi is universal, and servic depart at dealership aremajor profit centers. But pull off the execut of that vision is far easier said than done, and requir signific invest in infrastructur as well as talent. No one should ever have to wait nearlyeight monthsto get their car repaired.Dig through Tesla' SEC filings, there are data point that could suggest that Tesla need to be invest more aggress in custom support.makeArticleAd();Tesla technician perform servic on a Model S. Imag source: Tesla.A number gameFair warning: Thi will be an imperfect analysis, mostli due to imperfect public data. First, I took a look at cumul vehicl shipment over time, exclud the origin Roadster that onli sold about 2,500 units. While cumul unit sale are gener not a great proxi for instal base becaus some unit are inevit retir over time, Tesla' cumul unit sale may be closer than other exampl sinc car tend to have longer use live and the compani onli start ship the Model S less than five year ago. Thi isn't a small consum electron devic that you get rid of after two years. It' not perfect, but it' the closest proxi we can get.Tesla also report the total number of sale and servic locat that it operates. It would be more use to distinguish between sale and service, but for report purpos the compani aggreg all locations. Third-parti author bodi shop are not includ in these figures, as Tesla doe not report how larg it network is. Here' a chart of both cumul unit sale and Tesla store and servic center over the past five years.Data source: SEC filings. Chart by author.However, if you divid cumul unit sale by Tesla-oper locations, then it start to make sens whi Tesla' support infrastructur is somewhat strain right now. Cumul unit per locat rose from 91.5 in 2012 to 693.2 in 2016.Data source: SEC file and author' calculations. Chart by author.Again, thi analysi is less than ideal sinc investor onli have Tesla' public disclosur to work with. It doe not account for geograph differ or concentrations, it cannot distinguish between sale and servic locations, and the instal base is certainli less than the roughli 184,000 Model S and Model X vehicl that Tesla ha deliv through the end of 2016. It' also not as if locat should scale linearli with deliveries. But direct on average, it stand to reason that Tesla' support infrastructur growth ha not kept pace with deliveri growth, which in turn lead to backlog within the network.It' also worth note that Tesla measur mani other intern metric to assess servic qualiti -- metric that public investor are not privi to. For example, head of sale and servic Jon McNeillrec notedthat 20% of job at Tesla' Palo Alto center are complet befor the custom can finish a cup of coffee, and that Tesla' overal part backlog ha been reduc by over 80%. These are also import data points, but they aren't the sort that investor get regular updat on.Model 3 will need even greater supportMeanwhile, Tesla doe not break out it capit spend in detail, either, so it' hard to gaug how much the compani is invest in support infrastructure. It goe without say that area like Gigafactori and Model 3 tool are the top priorities, but beyond that it' less clear. Here' CFO Jason Wheeler, who recent announc he wa leav Tesla to pursu opportun in public policy, respond to an analyst question on capit expenditur categori on the last earn call:W don't break down, we don't disclos the specif here, but obvious Gigafactori and Model 3 are go to be the biggest investments.

Why Intel Needed To Own Mobileye - Even If It Overpaid,3/14/2017,"Painfully, Intel (INTC) ha littl to no presenc in mobil devices, save for a few modem chip here and there. Most everyth on mobil devic is ARM-bas due to it lower power consumpt and cheaper costs. Intel and it -x86 platform simpli cannot compet on price or power performance.Hav realiz this, Intel ha decid to do what ani compani in it posit should do -- tri and buy it way into the future, acquir Mobiley (MBLY) for $15.3 billion.No Matter the CostmakeArticleAd();Th acquisition, which is be bill as help Intel turn into a data compani (whatev that means), isn't like to move the financi needl for Intel anytim soon.Mobiley gener just $240.6 million in revenu in fiscal 2016. By comparison, Intel' full year revenu wa $59.4 BILLION and it Data Center Group (which Intel is say Mobiley will fit into) had $17.2 billion in sales.Th Israeli-bas Mobiley gener $108.4 million in GAAP net incom in 2016, make the deal worth 141 time net income. That isn't exactli cheap, even if Mobiley is grow revenu at 46% year over year.Thi deal is about the futur of the car, one that will gener more data (thu need more comput power) than at ani time in history. Intel said car could gener as much as four terabyt of data per day, so it' import car have the comput power to understand and make sens of all that data.Mobiley is best known for it role in advanc driver assist system (ADAS), have work with compani like Tesla (TSLA), GM (GM), BMW (in conjunct with Intel) and other to bring self-driv car to the forefront. (In 2017, anoth 6 OEM will come onlin use Mobileye' chips, accord to Jefferi analyst David Kelley.)Limit ImpactThi deal isn't like to hurt Nvidia (NVDA), which make GPU for self-driv car or Qualcomm (QCOM) or NXP (NXPI), which also make chipset for cars. Chip for ADA system and the camera that go into them is a much smaller market than be the brain of a self-driv car platform. However, it' clear that Intel need to do someth to get into thi space, or risk lose out like it did with mobil devices.Ther is still the risk that car manufactur will cut Mobileye' unit out of it car (a happen with Tesla), but with Intel' muscl behind it, that seem less like to happen. Mobiley ha deal with a number of auto manufacturers, includ Volkswagen and BMW, enough to get it EyeQ chip into 16 million car by the end of 2016.Ultimately, thi is a deal Intel had to do. It miss out on buy Nvidia when it should have, as it wa too focus on the Altera acquisition. It can't buy AMD (AMD) becaus of the implic for the PC market and -x86 chips.Th PC market ha had littl to no growth for quit some time now, lead PC chip maker to wonder what' next. Intel' latest acquisit of automot chip maker Mobiley show that under Brian Krzanich, Intel is focus on the futur -- no matter what it costs."

About to Buy Driverless Car Stocks? Read This First,3/13/2017,"There' no shortag of technolog compani and automot maker that are are bet that autonom vehicl will transform both of their industries. But how do you figur out which compani are pois to benefit the most?To answer that, investor first need to know what the market potenti is for driverless cars, what might slow it down, and how long it will take for the segment to mature, and then determin which driverless car invest angl they want to take. Here are a few step to help you get started:Imag source: Getti Images.makeArticleAd();How much the driverless car market will be worthBi 2025, the driverless car market is expect to be worth $42 billion, accord to Boston Consult Group. The market size jump up to $77 billion by 2035, which is the same year thatIHSestim that there will be 76 million autonom vehicl alreadi on the road.And it doesn't end there. Driverless car are expect to transform ride share services, allow car owner to rent out their own vehicl -- asTesla's(NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO Elon Musk ha suggest -- and even help tradit carmak creat their own ride hail services, likeFord(NYSE: F) ha proposed.Thi might slow driverless car stock downIt' not go to be all sunshin and lollipop for driverless car stock though. There are still mani hurdl face these companies, includ feder regulations, safeti concerns, and consum adopt issues.Th two biggest automot markets, howev -- the U.S. and China -- have thu far been veri open to driverless cars. Back in September, the feder govern releas guidelin for state to help ensur that compani are abl to innov and not be hamper by differ rule across state lines. But the problem is that we'r still in the veri earli stage of driverless car technolog (i.e. neither you nor I can buy fulli autonom vehicles), so while the govern is open to it now, that could chang when more tech start be use by the gener population.And even if the govern doesn't end up stifl autonom vehicles, there' current a grow movement toban driverless car in New Yorkbecaus peopl are afraid they'll elimin job for taxi drivers, bu driver and other in the transport sector. Add to that the fact that there are part of the popul thatfeel veri uneasyabout driverless car and it' clear that the autonom vehicl market still ha a long way to go.Ther are plenti of way to investCompani like Tesla are among the obviou choic for bet on driverless cars. CEO Elon Musk ha said he want to have a fulli autonom car capabl of drive itself across the countri by 2018, and everi new Tesla built right now alreadi ha the hardwar capabl for full autonomi (though not all of the softwar is activated).Tech behemothAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) is anoth clear choice. Google' parent compani recent spun out it driverless car segment into it own company,cal Waymo, and is work to bring fulli autonom minivan to the road thi year for public testing, along with a ride-shar service.And then there are chipmak likeNVIDIA(NASDAQ: NVDA) , which is invest heavili in artifici intellig and it own supercomput to power driverless cars. The company'sDr PX 2 supercomputeri alreadi use by 80 automak and automot supplier (includ Tesla) and is like to expand it automot revenu substanti in the come years.Of course, you could go the tradit rout too and bet on automak like Ford, which is also focus it attent on self-driv technologies. The compani recent invest $1 billion in a self-driv car start-up, call Argo AI, and say that it will releas it own fulli autonom vehicl (with no steer wheel!) by 2021.Ford may be take a slower approach than some other self-driv tech makers, but it ha plan to have 90 self-driv test vehicl on the road thi year and is work with more than 40 start-up on driverless car technology.And if you'r look for a driverless car stock outsid of the U.S., thenBaidu(NASDAQ: BIDU) isprob your best bet. The compani ha been develop self-driv technolog for year and just launch a test program in some Chines citi to implement it tech. The compani want to releas a fulli self-driv car by next year with the hope of have a ride-hail servic in the come years. Asid from it aggress driverless car approach, Baidu benefit from China' open to self-driv technolog and fewer regul for road test than the U.S.Here' how long you might need to wait for thi to play outAlright, so now we know how big thi market will be, some of the potenti hurdles, and who the key player are. So how long will investor have to wait for thi opportun to pan out? IH estim that we'll reach worldwid driverless car ubiqu by about 2050.That doesn't mean it'll take that long for driverless car stock to benefit of course, but it doe mean that we still have a long way to go befor the market will matur -- which make now the perfect time for investor to start consid driverless car stocks.10 stock we like better than NvidiaWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

McNeill note two import thing that Tesla is plan on do to improv the situat (emphasi added):W know from complaint that the bodi shop experi need to get a lot better -- and fast.What the servic team ha done so far is a roadmap of how we'r go to fix the autobodi experience. Wait time for appoint measur in hour and a hand of day currently. We'r provid same-day servic from the Bay Area to Oslo and everywher in between. In fact, almost 20% of job in our flagship center in Palo Alto are handl befor the custom can finish their cup of coffe (yes, you read that correctly).Thankfully, onli a hand of our owner experi accid each year. Sinc custom schedul and interfac with the bodi shop on their own, we'r larg blind to the servic pace.Most of the custom complaint about bodi shop mention parts, so we focus on thi issue. To date, we'v reduc backlog by over 80%.Even though we reduc part wait times, we continu to dig into the bodi shop complaints. What we found wa astound -- car sat at bodi shop for week and sometim month befor the bodi shop took action and, more often than not, the bodi shop blame Tesla for part delay were the veri shop that hadn't even order part or start the repair.W are appli brute forc to thi immediately.W will have individu on our team person manag each car on behalf of our custom that are in 3rd parti bodi shops.We'r also go to increas our approv shop count by 300 over the next few week as well as elimin poor perform shops.If you have an issu with a shop, pleas PM me directli and our team will advoc and manag your repair.Tesla owner will get the servic they expect from us - period.Thank to the entir servic team for their commit to set the highest standard for servic in the industry,JonPart of the issu is that sinc these are third-parti bodi shops, Tesla ha less visibl into the repair timelines.

In contrast, Tesla produc approxim 84,000 vehicl in 2016.

The Simple Reason Why I Won't Buy Tesla,3/11/2017,"Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) is, arguably, the quintissenti stori stock. I know, I know... that' not exactli a revel at thi point. Elon Musk set out to creat a world power by renew energi and fill with electr vehicles, told us about how great it would be, made itsexy, and now we can't get enough of the vision. But it ha it drawback -- such as have an impossible-to-justifi valuation.When confront with Tesla' ridicul valuation, bullish investor counter that there' no comparison to what Musk is build with the brand. That' true, but I find the argument to be dangerous, not becaus I don't appreci what the compani is attempt to accomplish, but becaus analyst and investor aren't appreci that the compani could fail to accomplish what it' attempting.A gaudi (and simpli ridiculous) valuat is the simpl reason whi I won't buy Tesla, and I think other investor may feel the same way.makeArticleAd();Imag source: Tesla.Pric is what you payTh just-releas full-year 2016 earn show impress year-over-year growth and promis even more in the first-half of 2017. The Model 3 launch in Juli and subsequ product ramp-up in the fourth quarter of thi year have the potenti to realli push growth to the next level.Throw in a simultan ramp-up of energi storag product from Gigafactori 1, and it' easi to see whi investor are excited. But is all of thi worth$40 billion of excitement?Tesla is now worth nearli as much asFord Motor CompanyandGener Motors-- establish automak that sell more car in less than one month than the compani did in all of 2016.TSLA Market Capdata byYCharts.Investor could argu that offer the first mass-market electr vehicl earn Tesla it enorm valuation, but it' not a veri good argument. Ford and Gener Motor -- and most major automak -- are readi electr vehicl for market launch in the next sever years. Mani have plan to greatli expand their offer of electr vehicl in the next 10 to 15 years.For instance, the Chevi Bolt, which ha a start price of $37,495 and offer a 238-mile range, promis to give the Model 3 a run for it money. It becam avail in two state last Decemb and will increas it footprint thi year.Meanwhile, Ford ha an""electrification"" strategythat will gradual transit the automak to hybrid and fulli electr vehicl over the next decade. The Ford Fusion Energi wa the fourth best-sel electr vehicl in the Unit State through the first 10 month of last year.In addit to direct competition, electr vehicl sold by compani other than Tesla will eat away at the company' revenu stream provid by Zero Emiss Vehicl (ZEV) credits, which are sold to compli with regulatori oblig in certain states. In 2016, these account for $302 million in revenue. It may not seem like much, but given the revenu is essenti cost free, ZEV credit sale account for 19% of the company' gross profit last year.What about non-transport growth?Investor could argu that, asid from lead the way on electr vehicles, Tesla' hefti valuat is partial earn from lead the way in solar power and energi storage. The annual updat letter certainli show impress growth last year.What it didn't show is that the compani appear to be abandon plan to manufactur Silveo modules, and will instead purchas ""custom made modules"" from Panasonic, accord to an agreement sign in Decemb 2016. That could result in a signific writedown of the acquisit cost and technolog development.Th updat letter also doesn't mention that Tesla' energy-storag ambitionsaren't realist from a technic standpoint. In addit to thermodynam obstacl from specif lithium-ion chemistries, research who have crunch all of the detail number don't think there will be much -- if ani -- batteri cost-reduct benefit from build larger batteri factories. That should make investor a littl uncomfortable, especi consid cost reduct were a crucial argument defend billion of dollar in expens for build Gigafactori 1.Whi Tesla isn't for meTesla' relianc on storytel is offput to me, doubli so when it result in a $40 billion market cap that is imposs to realli justify. Investor continu to overvalu the potenti of imagin solar roof and uneconom residenti energi storage. However, the real driver for the company' renew energi strategi are more like to be ride the continu growth in tradit residenti solar and sell energi storag product into nich markets, such as peak demand stop gap for util companies. Even then, the market opportun is less -- and the competit more -- than investor properli gauge.Sharehold today may benefit from the Musk Halo Effect -- which attach a premium valuat to, or boosts, public goodwil of compani and project he' involv with -- but that doesn't mean investor should bank on it last indefinitely. It' the simpl reason whi I won't be buy Tesla.10 stock we like better than TeslaWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

How Tesla Can Fix Its Flawed Solar Business,3/11/2017,"Tesla's(NASDAQ: TSLA) acquisit of SolarC wa tout as a way to vertic integr the EV compani into a one-stop renew energi provid for customers. Walk in a Tesla retail store, and you can walk out with an electr car run on electr from your roof that wa store all day in your Powerwall.Th realiti of solar in 2017 is that SolarCity' busi model is dying. The lease/pow purchas agreement (PPA) that made SolarC so popular in the first place is be replac by loan and cash sales, which are better serv by smaller installers. Sale are becom harder as the low-hang fruit ha alreadi been nab by a highli competit industry. The old SolarC isn't what it use to be.What' interest are the new solar product that SolarC start work on, and Tesla is finishing. The solar manufactur plant that' suppos to build high-effici solar panel in Buffalo, New York, and the new solar roof product, which will eventu pair with the Powerwal to creat a holist energi solut are a path forward for Tesla. But the instal and sale wing of the solar busi have becom a weight Tesla should no longer be will to hold.makeArticleAd();Tesla' solar roof is a big product come in 2017. Imag source: Tesla.Tesla should cut thousand of jobsThi sound dramatic, but don't worry, there' still lot of work for peopl to do instal Tesla solar systems. However, mayb it doesn't make sens for them to do that work under Tesla' umbrella.When SolarC built out it solar business, it put most of it work into build out a sale forc that could sell solar system and an instal forc that could put them up. The large, nation solar model wa work and did until the end of 2015. But,accord to GTM Research, the top three solar instal in the countri grew at just 10% in 2016 while all other instal grew 53%. Tesla/SolarCity' declin is even more pronounc with deploy fall from253 MW in Q4 2015to201 MW in Q4 2016.Imag source:GTM Research.Thi isn't necessarili a problem becaus Tesla would like to autom the sale process, or move it into Tesla' stores. So, it make sens for fewer for Tesla worker to be sell door-to-door the way SolarC did.On the instal side, Tesla could offload work to hundr of contract partner the do the actual instal work rather than have the team in-house. Own the instal side of the busi mean Tesla is take on the oper cost of hire worker and buy instal equipment, and it ha to constantli keep those worker busy. If thi work wa contract out, it would lower risk and potenti lower cost as contractor compet for business.Thi wouldn't be a novel approach. Most of the construct busi work on thi contractor model, whether it' build a home or replac a roof or a kitchen. And with small solar instal take market share from Tesla, it would be wise for it to lower it oper risk.Th Powerwal could be the center of a new solar strategi at Tesla. Imag source: Tesla.Cr a pre-engin solut that can scaleIf Tesla move to a busi model that contract out work, it would need to creat an easy-to-instal solut for contractors. And that is alreadi on the way with the develop of the Powerwal and the solar panel made in-house. Soon, Tesla will be more vertic integr than ani other full servic solar compani (includ energi storage) so the compani could offer a suit of solut few compani could even dream of matching.Gigafactori 2, the Buffalo solar plant, will soon be make solar panels, and Tesla now own the rack compani for solar systems. These product could be pre-engin into a solut that would be sold to smaller contractors. Even the Powerwal would fit into thi model, and Tesla could provid servic to be the brain behind make the Powerwal econom viable.Th Solar Roof could be anoth extens of thi model, a product that could be sold through contractor without have to train in-hous instal on the product.Cr a pre-engin solut for contractor could creat a highli scalabl busi for Tesla, which would potenti lead to a bigger solar footprint overall, which is Musk' goal, after all.Ditch the solar leaseIf Tesla is seriou about turn the solar busi into a cash-flow business, it should elimin the lease, or power purchas agreement. Thi would be turn it back on the financ model that made SolarC popular, but the leas is lose market share rapidly, and it' not a product Tesla want to have on it balanc sheet anyway.Leas financ ha becom unattract over time becauseSolarCity' borrow cost were rising. Without low borrow cost the leas ha no advantag over a loan and with loan rate on the declin there no reason to keep the leas in the portfolio.If Tesla move to a contractor model for installations, it could offload the financ of solar system to third-parti banks, who are alreadi enter the market, and count on cash up front with each sale. Thi way, manag and investor could judg the solar busi on it margin and cash-flow gener rather than a question metric like retain value.Tesla would be better with a more focus solar businessIf Elon Musk want to creat a success solar busi long term, he should de-risk the busi by get out of instal and high-intens sales. Instead, focus the compani on make great product and provid the servic contractor need to sell them would be a move in the right direction. Investor would like cheer the move.10 stock we like better than TeslaWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The 5 Biggest Challenges to the Driverless Car Revolution,3/11/2017,"The year 2017 is gear up to be a moment year for the driverless car race. But despit major initi by megacorporationsAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) ,Tesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) , and others, there are major road block ahead for the driverless car revolution. A recentMcKinseyreport highlight five of them.1. PricingNo matter how incred an innov might be, it' useless if it' not affordable. Although Alphabet' Waymo ha clock more than 2 million road mile in it autonom vehicles, McKinsey estim that self-driv car are ""unlik to be avail befor 2020."" Alphabet and other are inch closer to commerci their products. A partnership withFiat Chrysler Automobil NV(NYSE: FCAU) will, for the first time, take Alphabet' autonom drive technolog out of it peculiar ""panda car"" and into 100 Pacifica Hybrid minivan in earli 2017. But those minivan aren't for sale, and, if they were, would probabl cost magnitud more than an averag minivan.2. Consum UnderstandingmakeArticleAd();Video source: Waymo viaYouTubeEven if driverless car becom affordable, no one will buy them if they don't understand them. That mean that self-driv car compani need to educ consum on the advantag of autonom vehicles. Inform video like the one abov produc by Alphabet' Waymo are an import start, and other like Tesla Motor are produc their ownvideo vignettesto make self-driv car salient. Tesla Motor and other have a clear busi incent to make self-driv seem mainstream, and the more that their messag is spread, the brighter the futur for their sale and sustainability.3. Safety/Secur issuesConsum understand goe hand in hand with a major concern about autonom technolog -- safeti and security. At no point wa thi clearer than in May 2016, when Tesla Motor report the first driver fatal while it Autopilot technolog wa engaged. The tragic crash occur when neither the driver nor Tesla Motors' technolog recogn a truck' white-color trailer cross it path on a highway. There will certainli be more tragedi in the futur of autonom vehicles, and it will remain a continu challeng and the highest prioriti for self-driv car compani to minim safeti and secur issues. However, it' also import to rememb that these high-profil case can caus over-reactions, and stick to statist can help investors, companies, and consum alik identifi the best autonom option for investing, manufacturing, and purchasing.4 & 5: Regul and TechnologyA with all new innovations, regul and technolog can make or break a revolution. The McKinsey report is quick to note that regul is a hurdle, rather than a never-end issue. It make sense, then, that Ford, Alphabet, Lyft, Uber, and Volvo Car have all join togeth to creat the ""Self-Driv Coalit for Safer Streets."" Rather than ralli for ""wild west"" free market competition, these compani want to see a sensibl framework of standard regul upon which they can confid build their new busi units.Technolog isn't a hurdle, but there is a minimum threshold below which driverless car will never be the norm. Compani like Alphabet' Waymo and Tesla Motor are aim for full autonomy, while other are take the more step-wis approach of offer semi-autonom addit like Audi' ""Traffic Jam Assist."" The McKinsey report estim that, onc regul and technolog issu have been resolved, ""up to 15 percent of new car sold in 2030 could be fulli autonomous.""Hit the brakes?Imag Source: Getti Images.2017 will not be the year self-driv car take over our roads. Pricing, consum understanding, safety/security, regulation, and technolog issu will continu to imped thi industry' revolution. But Alphabet, Tesla Motors, and other are make steadi gain on address these issues, and the ultim widespread adopt of autonom technolog is almost inarguable. Forward-look investor with long-term horizon should acknowledg these issues, select their self-driv stock accordingly, and sit back to enjoy thi multi-year market road trip.10 stock we like better than Wal-MartWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Ford report in Januari that it net incom fell by $2.7 billion from the year-ago quarter, and revenu were down by $1.6 billion. But the loss came mainli from one-tim charg that the compani incur from cancel a factori in Mexico and pension plan costs.One-tim charg aside, Ford is still in a strong posit to grow in the driverless car space, and it $1 billion invest in it new driverless car AI compani Argo last month indic that Ford is more resolut than ever.Th company' stock current trade at forward P/E of just 7.28, much cheaper than the automot industri averag of 13, which easili put it in the bargain bin.Delphi AutomotiveA one of the world' largest automot supplier Delphi ha a front-row seat to the driverless car transform -- and the compani is take huge step to bring it about.

A littl trim wouldn't hurt, but the overal prognosi still look promising.Nvidia Stock: Slow Start, Fast FinishLet' start with the technic argument. I would be care in look too much into recent momentum. Rememb that dure last year' record-break move, the compani didn't jump straight from the gate. Nvidia share rang in 2016 with a near-17% loss up to mid-February. Back then, not onli wa NVDA below it 50-day, it wa danger close to fall below the 200-day.7 Cheap Dividend Stock to Buy NowRath than be a harbing for Nvidia stock, that level turn out to be the buy opportun of a lifetime. Histori doesn't alway repeat itself, that I'll easili conced … but I will also argu that viabl invest opportun maintain a certain cadence. Investor can use thi data to determin the likelihood of whether their posit will turn out profitable.Click to EnlargeWhat you should keep in mind is that Nvidia share are marathon runners, not 100-meter sprinters.

By the end of the third quarter, however, NVDA is churn out double-digit at 14%.When the year is final tallied, investor have taken home 55% averag profits. As I said earlier, nearer-term momentum isn't alway a reliabl barometer.What is a reliabl indic is the first-quart performance. Onli one time did Nvidia stock turn neg at the 90-day mark, and still manag to squeez out a profit in the full year. So if NVDA stock is in red ink on March 31, then yes, it' time to think about exposure.But if it end up in the black, I like my chances. Onli twice did NVDA do well in the first quarter, and go sour later in the year.Th Fundament Case for NvidiaFundament as well, I don't see how you can go wrong with Nvidia stock.

These compani aren't make the exact same move as NVIDIA, but each is pois to domin one of these segment in their own way.Imag source: Getti Images.makeArticleAd();An altern artifici intellig playNVIDIA is alreadytak big stepsto make AI a prioriti through it invest in deep learn technolog like Drive PX 2 (for cars) and server (DGX-1). But it' not the onli one who will benefit from the tech sector' focu on AI. Just look at the size of the artifici intellig market over the next few year (hint: there' plenti of room for lot of winners).Data source:TracticaandStatista.And thi is where Amazon come in. The compani ha a dedic AI team that' alreadi up to the ""thousands,"" accord to Amazon, and an AI focu that hit both the consum and enterpris markets.Amazon' Echo may seem like just anoth consum product, but power the unit is the company' Alexa virtual assistant. Alexa can answer basic questions, set alarms, check the weather, play music, and order item from Amazon (of course!). However, Alexa ha also been open to develop so that other compani can integr the AI into their own devic and services, and it ha even start a fund to suppli capit to compani that are do so.Amazon won't get rich off of sell Alexa-pow devices, but the assist is give the compani a leg up in the home autom space. Amazon is use it AI virtual assist to grow it own ecosystem, and it' clear from new rumor ofupcom Alexa-pow devicesand continu integr of Alexa into other product that the compani will continu to use thi AI to tie consum to it business.Th real AI play for Amazon will be through it web host services, AWS. The compani releas sever new AI servic to develop at it re:Inv confer a few month ago, includ an image-recognit platform and a text-to-speech service. And, most importantly, the compani releas a program that allow develop to creat AI chatbot capabl of multilevel conversations, similar to Alexa.Thes are all import becaus as Amazon releas these tool into the wild, it expect to be paid back through develop use those AI system by host them through AWS.Amazon brought in $3.53 billion with AW in Q4 2016 -- an increas of 47% year over year -- and with more complex AI system be built now and into the future, the compani will benefit from all of those AI system need a robust cloud host service.Don't expect Amazon' AI strategi to be an immedi payoff, but the compani is take big step now with Alexa and it AI tool for develop to build a strong artifici intellig foundat for the future.An altern driverless car playNVIDIA bull know that driverless car will like play a big role in the company' future, and part of that opportun stem from the company' recent partnership with electr car maker Tesla. The automaker' self-driv technolog are power by NVIDIA' Drive PX 2 supercomputer, along with Tesla' own ""neural net for vision, sonar, and radar processing.""Tesla' driverless car play is a bit more hands-on than NVIDIA's, but it' no less important. CEO Elon Musk ha said that hi compani will bring a fulli autonom vehicl to market by 2018, and he ha also mention that Tesla owner will be abl torent out their autonom vehiclesin the near future, when they'r not use them.That' more than just lip service, of course. Tesla alreadi manufactur it latest model with fulli autonom hardwar built into everi new vehicle, and it' slowli releas new softwar updat as it gather more drive data. All of thi hardwar -- and the releas of new softwar -- mean Tesla is alreadi a few step ahead of the driverless car competition.An altern game and VR playOf course, game is one of NVIDIA' biggest opportunities. The compani alreadi bring in 62% of it total revenu from it game segment, and the grow virtual realiti market could help NVIDIA continu it game success. By 2020, the VR market will be worth an estim $70 billion.Investor look for an altern VR play should consid Sony' recent lead in the space. The compani releas it first VR headset just four month ago, and it recent report that it ha alreadi sold 915,000 units. For comparison' sake, the Oculu Rift ha sold an estim 243,000 units, and the HTC Vive ha sold 420,000, accord to Superdata Research.That' notabl becaus Sony' PlayStat VR headset sale are one of the first huge hardwar success for VR, and they are on track to surpass the company' own estim of sell 1 million headset in the first six months.Still, hardwar VR sale will eventu be eclips by VR softwar sales, and that' whi Soni truli ha a great opportun in virtual reality. The compani is alreadi work with 230 develop and content creator to build VR game and content for it game console, and it alreadi ha more than 70 VR games.Soni ha identifi virtual realiti as one of the key tobuild out it import Game and Network Servic division, and the initi number from it VR headset sale are a good indic that the compani is move quickli in that direction.Of course, there' no guarante the stock list abov will have the same success NVIDIA' had recently. Nor are Amazon, Tesla, or Soni make the exact same move that NVIDIA is. But if you'r look to tap into AI, driverless cars, and virtual reality, then you should certainli consid how each one of these compani is pois to domin their respect markets.10 stock we like better than NvidiaWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Residential Solar Revolution: Why National Installers Aren't Evolving Fast Enough,3/9/2017,"Just over two year ago, nearli three-quart of residenti solar compani use third-parti financ in the form of leas or power purchas agreement to financ their solar systems. Now, accord toGTM Research, that number fell to just 47% last quarter and the declin show no sign of slow down.Thi ha caus an upheav for instal built on the leas model, whether they'll admit it or not. SolarC wa in troubl untilTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) bought it out, andVivint Solar(NYSE: VSLR) andSunrun(NASDAQ: RUN) haven't been abl to turn their leas busi into sustain profit businesses, either. With the financ trend changing, these compani need to find a new direct forward.Imag source: Getti Images.makeArticleAd();Chang gear in residenti solarI don't think the transit from sell solar system with leas to sell them with loan can be done over time becaus the compani I mention have too much financi incent to sell leas rather than loans. Tesla is tri to make the transition, but it instal are declining, and it wa still onli 28% sale and 72% leas last quarter.Instead, nation instal need to rip off the Band-Aid: Ditch the leas and replac it with a loan product that will be easi for custom to understand. Thi will bring in cash immedi and reduc confus for customers.Anoth step they can take to transit their busi and gener cash is sell the portfolio of leas asset they have sit on the balanc sheet. There are a number of yieldco that would love to own those residenti solar asset at the right price. And even if the price isn't perfect, instal should want to sell their financ asset to focu on lower instal costs.Th third transit all solar compani need to make is think about differentiation. Financ wa a differenti a few year ago, but if cash or loan sale are the domin financ model, what separ Vivint from Sunrun, or anyon els at thi point?Tesla is make the case that it' differ with an upcom solar panel, the Powerwall, and the solar roof that' suppos to launch thi summer. If these product are successful, they will creat a path to the future.Sunrun and Vivint Solar have test some new product like energi storage, but they need to doubl down on the next generation. Vivint may be well serv integr more fulli with it sister company' secur solutions. Sunrun would be wise to partner with a high-effici solar panel manufactur and an energi storag compani to differenti itself.Financi result are start to dragWith the market move away from the nation instal model, financi are start to look wors for these installers. Tesla said it instal just 803 MW of solar in 2016, down from an origin guidanc of 1.25 GW. Vivint Solar' third quarter (the most recent reported) saw instal fall from 61 MW a year ago to 59 MW as it focus on leases. And while Sunrun is grow more than the other two and ha ad cash and loan products, it ha the highest cost of the three, which should lead to lower margin overall. It also ha a clear incent to push custom toward the more profit lease.Industri data show that the solar leas is dying, and solar instal need to adapt. I think that will requir a paradigm shift in how they think about their business, or they'll get run over by competitor who adapt more quickly.10 stock we like better than SunrunWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Make ""bets"" on a stock base on it recent percentag move doesn't make much sense, though, in a rage risk-on environ such as we'v seen sinc last November.makeArticleAd();Ov my career, I have found that appli a multi-time-fram approach to stock trade and invest not onli allow for better perspective, but as a result, also result in superior risk manag - and dare I say ""timing"" of trade entri and exits.I make it a point in thi column to often remind ye faith that stock are a highli correl asset class, particularli compar to other asset class such as commodities. While the price of pork belli ha littl correl with the price of gold, within the stock market, around 80% of stock tend to rise and fall togeth at ani given time. I point thi out becaus while the year-to-d ralli in AAPL stock is impress and worth respect until it reverses, there also ha been a broader stock market risk-on trade thu far in 2017.More than anything, I highlight thi for perspective.When I last discuss Appl stock onFeb. 2follow the latest earn report, I said that share were reach a critic technic area of resist through a multimonth lens. While AAPL ha sinc margin push abov thi technic area, the tale of two time frame remains.7 Cheap Dividend Stock to Buy NowToday, I would like to reiter and updat thi analysis.AAPL Stock ChartsOn the multiyear weekli chart, we see that Appl over the year ha greatli respect it 200-week simpl move averag (red), which wa a sourc of technic support in 2013 and again just last year.Click to EnlargeAt the same time, we also see that each time AAPL stock get overli extend abov thi move average, it tend to fall into a consolid phase. Currently, the stock trade roughli 30% abov thi move average; at past extremes, Appl trade as much as 50% abov it.From thi perspective, AAPL stock could have further to run on the upside.On the other hand, the MACD momentum oscil at the bottom of the chart ha now reach level that in the past led to some downsid pressure.Lastli - and I believ most importantli - the rate of chang (i.e., the near-vert ralli over the past coupl months) ha push AAPL stock back abov it 2015 highs. While thi in and of itself is a posit development, previou import high rare if ever are overcom on a sustain basi until and unless some consolid near those previou high ha taken place.Appl stock ha yet to consolidate. Thus, it like will find the current upsid momentum unsustain over the next few week or even months.Appl Inc. (AAPL) iPhon 8: New Name, Late Release?On the daili chart, we see that AAPL gap higher again follow it Jan. 31 earn report, and despit alreadi be overbought by plenti of measures, kept push higher as the broader stock market anim spirit brought in fresh momentum.Click to EnlargeNot that except for a coupl day in earli January, AAPL stock ha now held abov it 8-day simpl move averag (blue) sinc earli Decemb 2016. That is alongstretch to be trade abov such a near-term move average. I feel it increasingli beg for some consolid lower.At the same time, until thi move averag is broken on the downside, one must continu to respect the uptrend.Through thi near-term lens, if AAPL can close abov $140, a next squeez higher into $143 - $144 look plausible. Alternatively, a break and hold below $138.50 could set in motion a better consolid move lower with first downsid target near $136 and $132.Like what you see?

But it' a show car with a mission: To help Bentley decid if it' time to grab an opportun it see for an electr luxuri car posit abov the product fromTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) .The Bentley EXP 12 Speed 6e Concept could point the way to the British super-luxuri brand' first battery-electr vehicle.

The EXP 12 Speed 6e is definit a Bentley. Imag source: Bentley Motors.Bentley said that a product version would have rapid induct charg and ""a rang suffici for grand tour requirements."" But didn't give detail of the car' powertrain or specif on it batteri or range, becaus thi isn't intend to be a product car.Instead, as Bentley CEO Wolfgang Durheim explained, thi Bentley is intend to be a start point for convers with potenti customers:Th EXP 12 Speed 6e is a concept to show that Bentley is defin electr motor in the luxuri sector, with the appropri technology, high qualiti materi and refin level you'd expect from a true Bentley. Thi concept enabl us to engag with luxuri custom and gather feedback on our approach.Bentley is commit to offer an electr model in it futur portfolio and we are interest to receiv feedback on thi concept.In an interview at the Geneva Motor Show, Durheim toldBloombergthat part of the idea is to find out if it' time for Bentley to develop an electr model -- or if it custom will continu to be happi with combust engin and hybrid for the time being. (Bentley will roll out it first plug-in hybrid next year.) If the electr concept is well-received, Bentley could have an electr model on the market by 2021, he said.But whether it turn out to be the right time or not, an electr Bentley is coming, thank to an opportun creat by Tesla.Whi Tesla' success creat an open for an electr BentleyBentley, like other super-luxuri brands, is eye the market segment abov vehicl like Tesla' Model S and Model X. Those Tesla are broadli competit with the upper-ti model from luxuri brand likeBMWand Mercedes-Benz in term of perform and featur (and price). But there' space for someth even more luxurious.Brand like Bentley, and it British competitor Rolls-Royc and Aston Martin, have for mani year found a small but profit market in luxuri car that are a step up from the like of BMW and Mercedes. Now, they seean opportun to build carsfor well-heeled, electric-car enthusiast who might be happi Tesla owner today, but might also be interest in an opportun to move up to someth more deluxe, more personalized.Bentley' typic attent to hand-craft detail is far from ordinary, even by Tesla or BMW standards. Imag source: Bentley Motors.To credibl appeal to Tesla owners, Bentley will have to incorpor high-qual technolog into it eventu electr car. That shouldn't be a problem: Bentley Motor is own by giantVolkswagen AG(NASDAQOTH: VLKAY) , and will presum take advantag of the battery-electr technolog be develop for it sibl brands, Audi and Porsche.That technolog is thought to be quit advanced: Audi plan to launch a battery-electr SUV aim directli at Tesla' Model Xearli next year.

The total world market for such a Bentley might onli be a few thousand model a year, at most -- at least at first. But thi is a brand that sold a grand total 11,023 car worldwid last year. Given that an electr Bentley would be use technolog sourc from it corpor parent, it doesn't seem like it would have to sell in huge number to turn a profit.With Europ and China move more aggress toward electr vehicles, and all of those Tesla custom in the Unit States, it seem like that a well-don Bentley with a competit battery-electr drivetrain would find enough custom to make the effort worthwhile.

In fact, CEO Richard Hayn said in the Q4 releas that Urban Outfitt wouldincreaseit focu on DTC sales. Store occup cost were flat as a percentag of sale in the fourth quarter.

It doe appear that the Urban Outfitt brand, which account for 40% of FY17 sales, is reason well-positioned. That brand did have higher markdown in Q4 - but lower discount on a full-year basis.Th other 60% or so of the retail base, however, may have some concerns.Snap Inc (SNAP) Stock: Stay Away at All Costs!Anthropologi sale declin in Q4, as mentioned, even with higher markdowns.

Repairing My Tesla Model S Has Been an Utter Nightmare -- and It's Mostly Tesla's Fault,3/7/2017,"Seven months, three weeks, and three days.That' how long it' been sinc myTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) Model S wa involv in an accid and Istilldon't have my car back. That' nearli eight month of rather larg monthli payment for a car that I'm unabl to drive; nearli eight month of increment higher cost associ with insur and registr for a car that' sit in the shop; nearli eight month of have to find and arrang altern transportation; nearli eight month of have to buy ga again, while the ga save had previous offset part of said larg monthli payments; nearli eight month of impati wait to get back a car that I absolut love; nearli eight month of regularli prod Tesla for updat with littl to no success.Mi Model S, shortli befor the accident. Imag source: Author.makeArticleAd();Y may assum that my car wa involv in some sort of catastroph incid that requir a protract period of time to repair. Nope. It wa a run-of-the-mil accid (more detail later). Tesla is predominantli respons for whi it is take so long, becaus out of those eight months, over five of them were spent do noth but wait for parts.Let me back up a bit and start from the beginning.Jan. 27, 2016: Deliveri dayIn late 2015, my wife and I decid to take the plung and buy a Model S. We had been longtim support and investor in the company, firstbuy share in 2011. We final pull the trigger in Decemb of that year. In order to save quit a bit of money, we opt for a certifi pre-own (CPO) model, which cost about a third less than a compar equip new Model S would have cost at the time.At the time, the Colorado state tax credit ($6,000) for electr vehicl could be claim on use vehicl provid that the car ha never been regist in the state. (The state credit wa recent amend to exclud use vehicles, effect start 2017.) So we found one that wa locat in New Jersey, and even after pay the maximum transport fee ($1,500), it still easili work out in our favor. It wa less than 2 year old and had less than 20,000 mile on it; not bad for what we save by go CPO. It wa even the exact same shade of dark green as my first car, a color option that had sinc been discontinu -- bonu nostalgia points.Deliveri day at the Tesla servic center. Imag source: Author.It took about a month for the car to arrive, but we immedi fell in love with it. We start take road trip more often (within the bound of the Supercharg network, of course), and frequent found excus just to drive and enjoy the instant torque.Lik most Tesla customers, we becam involuntari but not unwil advoc for the company, field a constant string of question from friends, family, and stranger regard how the car work as well as about the necessari behavior adjust associ with go all-electric. We also attract the typic confound stare when we'd put someth in the frunk, or put the kid in the rear-fac seat that we had Tesla retrofit post-delivery.A coupl month after take delivery, we place a reserv for a Model 3 on March 31, the day that Tesla unveil the vehicl and start take deposits.Juli 11, 2016: Accid dayI wa actual at the Tesla factori in Fremont, California, when the accid occur (I work for Tesla veri briefli dure the summer of 2016). My wife call me frantically, exasper that she had been involv in an accident. Most importantly, she wa larg unharmed; just some minor whiplash that she quickli recov from. She wa more concern that the car had been injured. She had been drive home from work, sit stationari at a stop light, when a young driver fail to hit the brake in time and rear-end the vehicl at a rel low speed.Here' the pictur I ask her to take of the car immedi after the impact:Immedi after the accident. Imag source: Author.It look wors than it was, in part becaus the Model S and Model X contain more aluminum than most vehicles. Aluminum crumpl much easier than steel sinc it' a softer metal. Thi is also an import safeti featur sinc the crumpl zone are both larger and abl to absorb more impact, with the downsid be that aluminum is more expensive. A consequ is that Tesla accid look realli bad becaus the vehicl get mangled, but the function benefit is minim intrus into the passeng cabin.Less than six month after we had taken delivery, our Model S wa off to the shop.Nearli eight month later...Whil Tesla perform most routin servic itself, it outsourc major bodi work to a network of third-parti bodi shop that are certifi by Tesla. The certif process is expens and time-consuming, but certifi bodi shop will garner most of the local busi (there is onli one certifi bodi shop in my immedi area).Shortli after receiv my damag car, the bodi shop start tear down the vehicl to assess the damage, and order the part that would be necessari for the repair. The vast major of the repair time ha been gobbl up here. I had heard and read stori about Tesla part take longer to deliv rel to the rest of the industry, but that' somewhat expect for a young car compani with just one factory.Anecdotally, stori of it take two to three month for Tesla to deliv part are not uncommon. After three month had pass and the bodi shop had still not receiv all the necessari parts, we began reach out to Tesla directli through their custom servic channels, which serv as a liaison to the intern part department.At the bodi shop. Imag source: Author.Initially, no custom servic repres that we interact with wa will to take ownership of our issue. We kept get pass between repres with littl to no use inform (a custom servic manag eventu took ownership of handl our issu after repeat escalations). Part had start to trickl in, but there still weren't enough to start the repair so our car continu to sit idly. Two of the more pertin part were a rear lift gate and rear quarter panel, which were still outstanding. Dure one of the escal in Novemb (four month after the accident), Tesla guarante us that all part would arriv at the bodi shop no later than the last week of November. They didn't.In mid-December, the shopfinallyreceiv enough (but not all) part to start work on the car. At that point, the holiday were nearli upon us, and everi industri slow down around that time of year. The bodi shop would begin the repair in earli Januari 2017 after the holidays. There were still a few outstand parts, includ bulb rivets. I would think that someth as basic as rivet would be among the easier part to deliver, but evid I'm wrong (and not alone). We again contact custom service, and Tesla again assur us they had just ship the remain part for overnight delivery. Frankly, we didn't have much faith at thi point, as we had been told thi before. But in the final week of January, the shop confirm that they had inde receiv all remain part necessari to complet the repair. It look like light at the end of the tunnel, six month in. At thi point in the story, the car ha spentmor time in the shop than in our possession.A coupl week ago, the bodi shop updat us that the car wa about to enter the paint shop, at which point it should onli be a coupl more week to reassembl the paint piec and then perform electron calibr and a few other outstand items. It turn out that the 12V batteri is also now in need of replacement, as it will no longer hold a charg (perhap relat to how long the car ha been sit idle?). The shop order the batteri a week and a half ago. Tesla use exactli one specif supplier for it 12V batteries, which is struggl to keep up with Tesla' demands. We'r now look at yet anoth delay for the 12V battery, which is a part that most peopl are abl to purchas for their vehicl local within 15 minutes.A soon as Tesla deliv thi battery, the car will be readi within a day or two. It' suppos to be readi thi week, but at thi point I have incred low expectations, as we are again wait on Tesla to deliver.Look, Ma: No car!Tesla is known for have a gener loaner polici when vehicl are be serviced, but sadli thi polici doe not appli to bodi work.Th driver that hit us wa uninsured, so we had to file our claim through our collis coverage, and we have coverag for a rental. But our rental coverag max out at 45 days, which is typic suffici time for most bodi repairs. Have alreadi known that our repair would probabl take at least two months, I knew we would need to arrang altern transportation. Even if we opt to use our insur company' negoti rental rates, it would cost approxim $1,000 per month to rent a car. That'sin additionto the monthli loan payment that we are still paying.Fortunately, my parent are retired, and as such have littl need for their cars. My mother gracious agre to let me borrow her car as long as needed, which reliev us of have to bleed out a small fortun ($7,000 by now) in rental fee for an indefinit and still ongo period of time.What thi mean for investorsTo say that thi whole experi ha been traumat would be an understatement. As long-stand investor and newfound customers, it ha profoundli shaken our faith in Tesla as a company. Thu far, Tesla ha not given us a reason as towhyour part were so sever delayed, so we have no indic as to whether or not thi is a one-off except or if there is some system problem within Tesla' part operations. While we'v been waiting, Tesla ha deliv ten of thousand of vehicles, includ about 29,000 Model S sedans.Som of Tesla' weak here is certainli relat to it own abil to produc parts, which continu to improv everi month. Theoretically, part product should improv as Tesla continu to ramp it overal manufactur capacity, but it seem like thi can't be the onli reason. I'm mildli confid that my case is an outlier, but even if it is, it' still disconcert that situat like thi can slip through the crack after repeat escal and assurances.It also call into question Tesla' abil to support it exist custom base, which is of critic relev to whether or not Tesla can support amassivelylarg custom base. The compani is still target 500,000 unit in 2018. As mani analyst and pundit point out, the mainstream is far less forgiv for thi sort of thing compar to enthusiast earli adopters.W are now question our Model 3 reservation. We haven't final our decision, nor will we have to for a few more months. Own two Tesla now seem like a signific risk should one of them ever be involv in ani type of accident, small or large. In share our stori with other Model 3 reserv holders, we know that a few of them cancel as a direct result, sinc our run-of-the-mil repair ha devolv into an utter nightmare.10 stock we like better than TeslaWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Why Utilities and Solar Companies May Be Finding Common Ground,3/6/2017,"As the solar industri becom more competitive, both within the industri and with fossil fuels, compani are have to figur out where they most effici fit into the market. For a while, solar compani thought they may have an advantag in develop and own solar projects, lead to the structur of mani of the compani you know today.First Solar(NASDAQ: FSLR) ,SunPower(NASDAQ: SPWR) , andCanadian Solar(NASDAQ: CSIQ) all bought develop compani to build larg projects, andTesla's(NASDAQ: TSLA) SolarC wa alway a solar develop that own the system it built. And all of these compani either plan to own solar system long term or drop them down to yieldcos.A thi wa happening, util across the countri began to develop their own renew energi strategies. The begin wa buy renew energi project from developers, includ the solar compani mention above. But with more experience, they'v move more and more into solar project develop themselves, cut out the middleman.A the solar industri and util industri begin to collide, each ha to figur out where they fit in the new world of energy. And we may be see some hint about where the industri will land in the long term.makeArticleAd();Imag source: Getti Images.Util learn their renew energi roleA util have enter the solar market, they'v found that that there are place where they hold an advantag over solar companies. They may not ever manufactur solar panel or creat a great rack system, but they have a lower cost of capit than solar companies. When the yieldco yield rose and made it difficult for solar compani to drop down asset to an entiti they controlled, util had an open becaus they still had a low cost of capital.What also make sens is that util will move from buy complet solar project to develop them in-house.NextEra Energy,NRG Energy, andDuk Energyhav all develop renew energi develop arm that do more than just buy projects.To that end,AES(NYSE: AES) bought solar developersPowerfor $1.58 billion late last month. AE ha been a leader in develop energi storag solut around the country, and now it' a leader in solar as well.What about solar companies?Whil util are move more into development, there' still a big role for solar compani to play. They may not be do financ and site selection, but they'll be make panels, design track solutions, and make integr solut that util develop will use.If you look at the strategi chang at First Solar and SunPow over the past year, they fit into thi new energi world perfectly. They'v move from project develop to suppli solutions, such as Oasi from SunPow and the Seri 6 product from First Solar. They'r expand their offer beyond solar panel into racking, site design, and inverters, but they may not be move as far into the industri as own project long term.Even Tesla is sell most of it energi storag solut to util or other third-parti develop rather than store them on the balanc sheet.Stick to what you do bestTher will continu to be tension between util and the solar compani upend their business, but the tension may not be focus on the util side in the future. It make sens for util to stick to project ownership and some develop work, while solar compani offer plug-and-play solut where develop need energy. Thi may lead to a more stabl solar industri long term, and it will make it less riski for investors, too.10 stock we like better than Wal-MartWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

It headquart in California would make work togeth simpler than coordin across the countri with Detroit.In a similar vein, Comcast and Netflix both cater to Apple' long-held desir to launch it own content stream service. Apple' abil to secur content right from major produc ha been the main thorn in it side. Both Netflix and Comcast control consider content rights, though Netflix is newer to thi game. As such, own either Comcast or Netflix could suppli Appl with the negoti leverag it need to final bring the requir parti to the table.Unfortunately, acquir ani of these compani would requir Appl pay a signific premium to their current prices, which could be particularli troubl for already-expens stock like Netflix and Tesla. There are also integration, cultural, and regulatori consider that could make such a maneuv highli complex for Apple, though the idea isn't entir without merit.Idea 2: More capit return?Thi come from the ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"" school of thought sinc Appl ha thu far use it cash reserv to financ it dividend and share buybacks. To do so, Appl ha cleverli use it oversea rich as collater to borrow against to fund it massiv capit return programto great effect.Appl ha paid out a whop $201 billion of it current $250 billion capit return program as of it most recent earn report, includ $15 billion in dividend and buyback in it latest quarter (Q1 FY 2017). Appl gener $27 billion in oper cash flow last year, and it capex requir are minim -- $3 billion last quarter. Thi make the statu quo seem sustainable, although the recent ralli inAppl stockmak thi option increasingli less appealing.AAPL PE Ratio (TTM)data byYCharts.Stock buyback becom less effect as a company'svalu increases, so Apple' dramat multipl expans ha made thi tactic less attract than it wa a year ago. However, with Appl still trade at a discount to the market, and it cash balanc rising, there' certainli a fair case to be made that further buyback and dividend remain a worthi use of Apple' riches.Idea 3: Financ import capex?If Project Titan is inde real, I think the chanc of Appl implement thi third idea are quit strong. One of the most import question Appl must answer along the way is how will it manufactur the electr vehicle?A I havenotedin the past, automobil manufactur is a capital-intensive, low-margin business. Thi leav Appl face a potenti catch-22 with Project Titan, drive meaning sale growth while also dramat erod it now-cushi profit margin in the process.Perhap the best solut to thi problem is to follow a tactic similar to Apple' contract manufactur arrang with Asian assembl specialistsFoxconn. Appl design product and maintain qualiti control, but it hand over the actual widget-making, the low-margin part of the process, to someon else. Thi is how the major of Apple' consum electron get made today.Th key speed bump with thi idea is that there are no large-scal automot contract manufactur that exist today to provid thi servic to Apple, and that' where Apple' mountain of money come into play. Assum it find a will and capabl partner to build Project Titan, Appl could use it cash to financ the construct of the factori infrastructur necessari to bring Project Titan to life.In fact, Appl ha pursu a similar strategi in the past. It partner with the now-defunct GT Advanc Technolog to financ the construct of a factori that GT Advanc plan to use to produc commerci sapphir for Apple' fingerprint scanners. If it doe so, Appl will want to take great care to avoid past mistakes, like bankrupt GT Advanc under the oner term of it financ deal. Regardless, thi idea is sound as long as Apple' auto ambit are inde as real as portray in the media.Cash is kingOf course, thi onli scratch the surfac in term of possibl use of Apple' cash. U.S. tax polici overhaul will also have a signific influenc on Apple' options, so interest investor will want to stay in tune with the nation discuss around it in the come months. At the end of the day, though, Apple' billion in the bank provid it with unparallel flexibl to pursu ani number of possibl actions, and that' someth in which Appl investor can and should find great comfort.10 stock we like better than AppleWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Well, they are and they aren't.Lithium-ion batteri were first commerci bySony(NYSE: SNE) back in 1991. And, yes, if you pack enough of them onto a car chassis, you can make a Tesla drive 200, 250, or even 300 mile on a singl charge, and yes, that' a greater rang than most other electr car offer today. But even the 18650 that the high-tech Gigafactori will churn out employ the same basic lithium nickel-cobalt-aluminum chemistri that' been in use for more than a decade.Employ a liquid electrolyt to shuttl lithium ion between anod and cathode, 18650 batteri still carri at least a (small) risk of incur a catastroph meltdown, such as the incid thatsunk Samsung stocklast year. And reli on a limit volum of lithium ion (about 2% of the battery' volume), intercal within a graphit anode, 18650 still provid less power than you could get from a pure lithium metal anod -- the aforement ""holi grail.""Luckili for electric-car enthusiast and ""green power"" afficionados, there' a better batteri on the way.Introduc Ionic MaterialsIt' call the solid polym lithium metal battery, and it wa invent in 2011 by Tuft professor and former Bell Lab research Mike Zimmerman, who' now work to commerci the prototyp for mass product through hi new company, Ionic Materials.Instead of a liquid electrolyte, Ionic use a solid polym (a plasticlik material) to allow lithium ion to flow from anod to cathod and back again. Accord to Ionic, thi novel type of electrolyte::off the abil to function as the cathod electrolyteexhibit high conduct at room temperatureha high voltag stabilityi non-flammablei conduc to high-volum manufactur techniques.Ion also use a lithium metal battery, so there are more lithium ion to move. That mean Ionic' batteri pack a whole lot more punch than the lithium-ion batteri in use today. Oh, and becaus it' basic a piec of plastic, it' almost infinit malleabl and can be manufactur in form factor conduc to differ use -- long, wide, and flat for power tablet or cylindr to power flashlights. Why, it could even be mold to fit where need within a car chassis.A a bonus, it' world away from today' lithium-ion batteri in term of safety. On last month'sNOVAepisode, host David Pogu attack Ionic' batteri with a vengeance, pierc it with a screwdriv and snip off bit with scissors. Not onli did the solid polym lithium metal batteri not explod (a ani other lithium-ion batteri would have), it actual kept working, power an iPad even as it wa hack to pieces.When will it arrive?No, you cannot buy one, at least not right away.Ion Materi wa recent award a $3 million Advanc Research Project Agency-Energi (ARPA-E) grant from the Depart of Energy.

This Week in Solar,3/4/2017,"As earn season move along, we'r learn more and more about what' go on within the solar industri at a tumultu time for manufactur and developers. Strategi are shift and allianc are changing, but earn tell the real stori of what' go on.Below I'll cover a coupl of interest strateg shifts, as well as polici and earn updat that happen thi week.Imag source: Getti Images.makeArticleAd();Tesla ditch SilevoIf there wa ani doubt thatTesla's(NASDAQ: TSLA) acquisit of SolarC meant the end of Silevo' technolog in the Buffalo, New York, solar factory, now dub Gigafactori 2,Tesla' 2016 10-Kend the debate. Panason will be in charg of manufactur and Tesla will be littl more than a customer. Here' the notabl segment from the filing:In Decemb 2016, we enter into a Product Price Agreement: Phase 1-3 ... with Panason Corporation, Panason Corpor of North America and Sanyo Electron Co., Ltd (collectively, Panasonic). Thi agreement provid that Panason will manufactur custom photovolta (PV) cell and modul for us, primarili at Gigafactori 2, and that we will purchas certain amount of PV cell and modul [from] Panason dure the 10-year term, with the intent to produc PV cell and modul total approxim 1 gigawatt annual begin in 2019.It' also worth note that Tesla said Silevo won't meet it last two mileston associ with the acquisit -- relat to reach target effici and manufactur volum and cost -- and record an $84 million gain as a result of the conting payout that will now not be made, an amount which wa record as an offset to selling, gener and administr expenses.Th solar manufactur situat at Tesla appear to be a complet mess, and with Silevo out, Panason is noth more than a tradit supplier. It' hard to see how that will lead to lower cost or higher effici than just buy solar panel on the open market.SunPow ha more big plan in ChinaWord trickl out thi week thatSunPower(NASDAQ: SPWR) ha sign a deal with Tianjin Zhonghaun Semiconductor (TZS) and China Eastern Electr Group (Dongfang Electr Corp.) to creat 5 GW of P-Seri manufactur in China. The agreement wa actual reach last week, but interestingly, manag is keep the deal low-key; it hasn't made an offici announc yet.Th joint ventur will reportedli have the two Chines compani each own 10% and SunPow own 80%. It is the second big move for SunPow into China after it tri to produc the C7 concentr product, which hasn't taken off as planned. Thi deal is intend to leverag domest cell suppli to creat solar panel that are slightli more effici than competitors'.If thi joint ventur doe creat 5 GW of solar panels, it could be transform for SunPower. The compani would enter a new level of scale in the solar industry, with a product more competit in the util market than it high-effici panel have been. Time will tell if the agreement work out as planned.Imag source: Getti Images.Upd on the solar polici fightTher were two major polici decis thi week that will impact the solar industry. The first is the EU Commiss extend solar trade duti on Chines solar cell and modul for anoth 18 months. Thi is notabl becauseCanadian Solar(NASDAQ: CSIQ) ,Trina Solar(NYSE: TSL) , andJA Solar Holdings(NASDAQ: JASO) have alldrop out of a minimum price schemein Europ and are now pay a tariff that' around 50% of the cost of a solar panel, depend on the manufacturer. The tariff will put a damper on demand in Europe, but given the cost advantag these compani have in China, fall price make the impact less and less meaningful.Solar compani and electr compani Arizona Public Servic (APS) have settl a contenti rate-design disput that will give residenti solar a littl life in the state. AP won't be implement demand charg for all residenti and commerci customers, and will instead give custom the option of a demand-bas rate or time-of-us rate. New rooftop-solar custom would have to pay a grid access fee but would be compens for energi export to the grid, albeit not at the same rate as net metering. It' not a perfect solut for solar companies, but it'll keep the industri from collaps overnight.Earn that slip through the cracksTher were two notabl solar-rel earn report thi week, fromPattern Energi Group(NASDAQ: PEGI) andNRG Yield(NYSE: NYLD) , that show some improv in the yieldco space.Pattern Energi said that gigawatt-hour sold jump 33% in the fourth quarter to 6,806 GWh, revenu wa up 7% to $354.1 million, and cash avail for distribut jump 44% to $133.0 million. The compani also announc a 1.4% increas in the dividend thi quarter, to $0.41375 per share.NRG Yield' result were fairli mixed, with adjust EBITDA (earn befor interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) rise from $189 million a year ago to $207 million in the recent fourth quarter. But the compani also swung from a quarterli net incom of $12 million last year to a net loss of $126 million. These loss aren't necessarili an indic of fundament weakness, given that most were impair losses, which are non-cash charg and don't impact operations.Check back next week for anoth recap of what' sure to be anoth busi week in solar energy.10 stock we like better than Wal-MartWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

(CAT)Caterpillar share plummet on Thursday as news thatfeder agenc had raid some of their corpor offices. The stock' dive wa stop by the 100-day move average. Thi trendlin ha now serv as support for Caterpillar share three time sinc Octob 2016.Typically, a headline-driven sell day like thi can be hard to step in on, but a few other thing didn't happen that would have serv as warn of greater declines.10 Danger Dividend Stock to Dump NowFirst, CAT stock did not break below it lower Bolling band, signal that, as volatil as yesterday' move was, it still fell within a somewhat normal distribut for the stock. Second, the stock didn't move far enough away from it 50-day to imagin that we couldn't see it move back abov thi key trendlin today.Thes two points, along with the fact that yesterday' sell volum suggest that investor may have rush out of CAT stock too quickly, leav a vacuum that may be easili fill by buyers, now lead us to take a short-term bullish trade outlook on Caterpillar shares.Nvidia Corpor (NVDA)Say it ain't so! Could thi be it for the long-term bullish run in Nvidia shares? The stock broke through the psycholog import $100 level earlier thi week and ha seen an acceler in sell sinc then. Now, share are trade at $96.65 and look helpless. Well, not exactly.Nvidia is get readi to hit potenti support at it 200-day move average. Thi is the same line that the stock came close to grab support from last week befor a short-term bounce. In addition, Nvidia share are also touch down to oversold read of their RSI, indic that the sell pressur that ha been move the stock lower may start run thin.That said, what would a bullish trade look like on Nvidia? Well, we want to see support at $94.35 hold, as NVDA hit these oversold readings. Thi should be enough to trigger a short-term rally. From there, we want to see NVDA take out the 50-day move average, which is current at $107.63 (of course, after break abov $100 again). Thi would put share back into ralli mode.Th risk? A break below $94, or reject at $100 on a short-term rally, will like open the path to anoth selloff that could see NVDA share break to $80. Thi one is well worth keep an eye on.Tesla Inc. (TSLA)Ahead of Tesla' earn we talk about the ""buy the rumor"" ralli that signal us to stay on the sidelin with the stock for the report.

Buying Snap Today Could Be Like Buying Apple 35 Years Ago,3/3/2017,"Snapchat (Shutterstock photo)Mani on Wall Street are compar Snap Inc.

All three can be consid social networks, reli on daili activ user and gener the major of their revenu from advertising.In the future, however, Snap may wind up be more like anoth Silicon Valley giant than the aforement one -- Appl (AAPL).makeArticleAd();Buy stock in Snap today is a bet on CEO Evan Spiegel more than it is on the company' prowess as an advertis behemoth. Spiegel, 26, is a product visionari the world ha not seen seen Apple' Steve Job and to some extent, Tesla Inc. (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk.Ther are similar between Job and Spiegel, both start their compani after drop out of college, are wonder salesmen and marketers, but the similar go further than that.Job is Spiegel' idol; he ha a portrait of the legendari Appl co-found hang in hi office. When unveil Spectacl toTh Wall Street Journalthi past fall, he even use Jobs-ian language, say ""You wanna see it?"" as he took off the towel cover the product. Thi mental play to the cultur of secreci at both companies, not releas product until they are readi to be talk about.And unlik other technolog companies, neither Snap or Appl have ""beta"" products. There is no group of earli adopt buy and use a product so the compani can get an idea of how user are interact with it and then continu to refine. Everi meticul detail is thought out and obsess over and is not releas until it' perfect.Aegi Capit analyst Victor Anthoni said the company' most valuabl asset is it demographic, with 13-24 year old compris nearli 60% of it user base. While these are highli covet by advertis such as Procter & Gamble, Clorox and others, Spiegel is the company' most valuabl asset. The abil to know what peopl want befor they want or see it is an invalu trait that veri few execut have. It can not be measur or valued, but it' someth that investor need to keenli awar of when look at where to put their invest dollars.Snap ha posit and sold itself as a camera company, have mention that multipl time in it S-1. Thi can allow them to expand into everyth and anyth that ha a camera.Despit the optim surround Spiegel, the sticki of Snapchat (engag level are shockingli high) and the covet user base, it' not all rose for Snap at thi stage.Ther are concern about the company' financi picture, as it still gener the major of it revenu from advertising. Go up against Facebook and Google, which have mountain of user data that advertis love, can be a daunt task (just ask Twitter).Issu surround slow user growth, the abil for competitor to copi product features, lack of data analytics, no vote control with Class A share are all valid reason to be wari of Snap, especi at a $35 billion valuation.But again, it come down to be at the forefront of an area that' onli go to expand with a product visionari for a CEO.Images, whether it' augment reality, virtual reality, move or static, are humanity' future. All you have to do is just look at the popular of Instagram to see why. Snap, with Snapchat, it burgeon hardwar portfolio and most importantli Spiegel, is pois to be at the forefront of thi trend for mani year to come."

It depend on how you look at it. On a year-over-year basis, thi growth is an acceler from the 27% year-over-year growth Tesla post in it fourth quarter. But when investor zoom out and look at what thi mean for the trajectori of Tesla' combin Model S and X unit on a sequenti basis, Tesla isn't expect much growth at all. Compar to combin Model S and X deliveri in the second half of 2016, 47,000 to 50,000 deliveri in the first half of 2017 would be up just 0% to 6%.And assum Tesla' late 2015-introduc Model X continu to account for a larger percentag of the electric-car maker' sale over the next few quarter as the compani ramp up product of the newer vehicle, thi guidanc may mean manag expect it Model S sale to decline. In fact, Model S sale have alreadi turn downward. In Tesla' fourth quarter of 2016, Model S sale were down 21% sequenti and 26% year over year.Stil a successOf course, if Tesla' combin Model S and X deliveri do level off at the 100,000-unit run rate they'r at today, thi would still be an impress volum for two luxuri model price between $68,000 and $168,000. Indeed, Model S is alreadi the best-sel larg luxuri sedan in thi price rang in the U.S. by a long shot. And Tesla' Model X SUV alreadi account for about 6% of U.S. larg luxuri SUV sales.Furthermore, base on Tesla' updat on demand for Model S and X in the company' fourth-quart sharehold letter, a meaning declin in combin Model S and X sale in the come quarter look highli unlikely.""Model S and X net order growth remain strong, as we are continu evolv our product by elev performance, convenience, and safety,"" manag explained. Tesla also said Model S and X order hit a record high dure the quarter and were up 49% year over year.Finally, it' worth note that abrupt paus in Tesla' sequenti growth have occur in the past on sever occasions.

Furthermore, share emphat broke out of the $120 area in 2014. PANW should requir a complet breakdown in the stori to relinquish it to the bear again.Click to EnlargeMi last trade on PANW wa a 2016 win iron condor between $156 per share and $90. I sold risk against both these level and wa lucki enough to expir both side for max gains. Thi is a fast-mov stock, so sell risk could be difficult to manage.

3 Catalysts That Will Propel Under Armour Inc (UAA) Stock,3/1/2017,"InvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsUnd Armour Inc(NYSE:UAA, NYSE:UA) remain a strong brand that is back by some of the biggest name in sports, includ Tom Brady, Steph Curry, Jordan Spieth and mani more.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockYet, a disconnect exist between the Under Armour brand and UAA stock, as the company'sfourth-quart reportmad it clear that investor had expect too much. Management, too, wa equal guilti of inflat expectations.Long-term investor are certainli feel the pain as Under Armour stock trade near multi-year low while the market trade at all-tim highs. Better day are ahead, though, and I have three convinc argument as to why.UAA Stock Catalyst: Expect Are ResetNow that the damag to UAA stock ha been done, step one of the rebound is to exceed the now-low expectations. Let' take a look at what the Street is model in the near-term. Accord to data compil by Yahoo! Finance, Wall Street analyst expect Under Armour' Q1 revenu to be $1.11 billion, which repres roughli a 6% year-over-year growth, but a sequenti declin from $1.3 billion in the most recent announc quarter.7 Stock That Will Hit All-Tim High in 2017I thi achievable? Base on recent history, the answer is a clear yes. In Q4, Under Armour' year-over-year revenu rose 12%, Q3 it rose 22%, Q2 it rose 28% and in the first quarter, it rose 30%.So 6% year-over-year growth is well below the company' histor trend. The easi setup head into the first-quart earn report could repres the first major catalyst that could jolt share back higher.Babi step are key here to reestablish faith in the company.UAA Stock Catalyst: Laps of a Major HeadwindUnd Armour is still feel the pain from Sport Authority' bankruptcy. Matt Powell, a sport industri analyst at The NPD Group,toldForbesthat SA' bankruptci could still haunt UA through Q1, ""but after that the drag should be over and trend should return to normal.""What Powel left out is that Under Armour' product are now sold inKohl' Corporation(NYSE:KSS) stores, which present the compani with a new distribut expans opportunity. Thi also repres a catalyst which peer likeNik Inc(NYSE:NKE) realiz years, if not decades, ago. If Under Armour achiev success in Kohl' stores, it could prompt the compani to expand into other retail chains. The company'sArmouri shop-in-shop conceptat Champ also serv as a sign of it dedic toward promot it brand in the mall.Here' a crazi thought - mayb Under Armour can occupi a presenc outsid of it core sport good channel and build up a strong presenc at store like Famou Footwear, which is own byCaler Inc(NYSE:CAL). After all, it doe sell a compel set of basketbal shoe back by one of the hottest NBA star - Steph Curry.UAA Stock Catalyst: New CFO to the Rescue?Und Armour' sale growth ha been accompani with a similar growth in SG&A spend. But sinc sale are no longer grow at the same pace as previous expected, manag would be wise to cut back on spend initi (without compromis on the necessari invest to support the brand, such as product innov and suppli chain.)Thi can be done. For starters, no more acquisitions. No more spend hundr of million of dollar for fit app - the categori is a nightmar - justlook atFitbit Inc(NYSE:FIT) - so it can cut back here. Also, manag can focu on promot and support exist store without open new one and also scale back on market expenses.Iron enough, Under Armour is still search for a new CFO. So naturally, the announc of a new execut whose first order of busi is cut spend would be met with cheers.Bottom Line on Under Armour IncAdida AG (ADR)(OTCMKTS:ADDYY) ha proven that a down-and-out athlet brand can make a comeback. The global athlet wear market is valu at around $300 billion, which mean it is certainli larg enough for Under Armour to continu grow and, bit by bit, steal share from the big boys.Elon Musk Is Drill a Hole in Tesla Inc (TSLA) StockNo one is say that Under Armour is the next Nike, but it ha proven itself veri capabl of grow over time. Now that expect have been complet reset, it is reason to believ that UAA can, at the veri least, beat the low bar and send UAA stock soaring.A of thi writing, Jayson Derrick did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlace7 MLP to Buy With High (And Growing!)

Best Buy Inc Co (BBY) Stock Dives Into the Retail Dumpster,3/1/2017,"InvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsBest Buy(NYSE:BBY) announc slightli lower same-stor sale dure the holiday season, and investor dump BBi stock in a hurry.makeArticleAd();Source:Austin Kirk via FlickrTh drop wa minor, less than 1%. But it wa unexpected, and miss analyst estim of a top-lin gain of 0.5%.For the quarter, Best Buy report earn of $607 million ($1.91 per share) on revenu of $13.48 billion. Thi compar with earn of just $479 million ($1.40) but revenu of $13.62 billion a year earlier. More importantly, while adjust profit of $1.95 per share easili beat estim of $1.67, revenu fell short of analysts' expectations, also for $13.62 billion.Th revenu shortfal meant analyst threw Best Buy stock into the dumpster with retail such asMacy' Inc.(NYSE:M), with share down almost 5% earli Wednesday, to $42.40. Dure the Christma season, on Dec. 8, the share trade as high as $49.31.Were the analyst right, or did they just offer smart investor a bargain? IsAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) about to kill all retailers, or is thi just a case of Moore' Law in action?Great Expect for Best BuyBest Buy even trounc the higher earn whisper number of $1.66 per share. But actual estimateswer all over the map, with some veri bearish about the company' abil to cut cost and other bullish on margins.7 Stock That Will Hit All-Tim High in 2017The Zack Metric Model note that BBi stock had beaten estim for four quarters, and that sharehold had been reward with a 36% gain. In particular, Best Buy wa post big gain in onlin sale - the so-cal ""omni-channel"" approach - and Zack wa expect an upsid surprise.On the bottom line, of course, Best Buy deliv one. And consid the sizabl beat, BBi share should'v rocket higher.But someth els is at play … and that someth is Moore' Law.Moore' Law Hit the Top LineMoore' Law, which turn 50 in 2015, wa describ byIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) co-found Gordon Moor as an expect increas in circuit densiti on silicon, doubl everi 18 month ago as far as he could see, in 1966.But, as I have been write for mani year now, Moore' Law alsoturn tradit econom on it head. Moore' Law is deflationary, and the deflationari impact grow with time, as integr circuit are incorpor into more and more things, and as the impact is compound by it use in variou ways.In the case of Best Buy, thi mean the product it sell lose valu as soon as they leav the factory, and the retail is under enorm pressur to get them out the door befor their valu disappears. Thi isn't new, but in 2016 it hit one of the company' primari growth sectors: big-screen TVs.A TV that would have been unafford just a few year ago - 5 feet wide on the diagon - is now avail at Best Buy forjust $600. More important, flat-screen set just don't break. I still have one from 2001.Could Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Take a Hint From Best Buy Co Inc (BBY)?Best Buy still make money on that 60-inch set, but the price point is lower, and thi is true for all consum electronics. Whole categori that use to repres big profits, like back-up drives, DVD player and packag software, have disappear as consum find they can get and save file to cloud services.Bottom Line on BBi StockTh new administr want to whip deflat now and, by allow price hike on oil and other resources, they could achiev the goal. China, too, seem dedic to fight deflation, give rais to mani worker in a more competit market.Thi should mean good news for Best Buy, which is focus more on product like oven and wash machin that have mechan part which sometim break. A new round of high-end phone should also help the top line.Bottom line? At a price-to-earn multipl of under 14, and a dividend yield 2.5% (that the compani is in a great posit to raise), BBi stock might be Best Buy' best bargain.Dana Blankenhorni a financi and technolog journalist.

"Could Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Take a Hint From Best Buy Co Inc (BBY)?",3/1/2017,"InvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) buysMacy' Inc(NYSE:M). It' a crazi idea, right? AMZN stock ha bare budg over the past coupl of week sincereportssurfac that Canada'sHudson' Bay Co(OTCMKTS:HBAYF) wa in talk to buy America' largest seller of apparel. Clearly, investor aren't hold their breath.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockTh media, on the other hand, ha been busi specul on the odd of a compani like Amazon get into a bid war with the icon Canadian retail that is run by an American and also ownsSak IncandLord & Taylor.Opinion vari on whether Amazon boss Jeff Bezo would make such a move, but let me assur you, it won't be for the real estate.No, if AMZN doe make a play for Macy' it will be for other, more-sens busi reasons. In fact, you could say Amazon would be take a page out of the playbook ofBest Buy Co Inc(NYSE:BBY), one of Amazon' biggest rival in electron retail.How' that, you say? Let me explain.AMZN Apparel Market ShareIn case you miss it, Amazon ha been slowli enter the apparel businesssinc debutingit own private-label brand in earli 2016 with 1,800 product avail for sale under name such as Scout and Ro, Franklin and Freeman, and Societi New York.Essentially, it' tri to fill the gap not cover by it third-parti sellers. However, a bigger attract of do it own thing isn't lost on investor of AMZN stock, which is that you make more sell your own stuff than you do somebodi else's.7 Best Stock to Buy for a Donald Trump Green LightAccord to Cowen & Co., Amazon is expect to pass Macy' in 2017 as America' top apparel seller and by 2022 should have16.2% market share.Whil it could do most of thi through it websites, have brick-and-mortar store ha alway been on the mind of analyst and retail expert alike.""W believ thi deal could address some of (Amazon's) major consum pain points,"" wrote Cowen & Co. analyst Oliv Chen in a recent report discuss the possibl of it buy Macy's. ""Amazon need better brands, a more curat assortment, a physic place to return items, and custom could use help with ensur fit - Macy' would also give Amazon greater credibl in curat and fashion authority.""That last part' a bit of stretch. I'm pretti sure if Amazon knock on your door and you'r a privat label apparel manufacturer, you'd let them in.Real EstateTo take full advantag of it privat label expansion, real estat is go to becom an import part of the equat as AMZN expand into brick-and-mortar locations. It' not a matter of if Amazon will do this, in my opinion, but when.Right now there is an abund of retail real estat come on stream through all the variou store close across America, including68 Macy' stores- part of the bigger 100 store close announc from last summer - in 2017, so find space isn't go to be a problem for AMZN.If you rememb what happen toTarget Corporation(NYSE:TGT) in Canada, buy all those leas in one big deal ultim wa it undo becaus it put way too much pressur on it employe to execut such a big undertaking.So, there is the argument that Amazon could expand one target market at a time until it ha store across the U.S. Unfortunately, that would take a decad or longer to execute. If it realli want to open retail store thi isn't an appropri solut for a growth compani like AMZN.Whi Best Buy?Busi wasn't look good for the Minneapolis-bas electron retail until CEO Hubert Joli turn the compani upsid down in 2012 implement it infam ""Renew Blue"" turnaround plan that turn physic store locat into local distribut hub for it e-commerc business.Form CFO Sharon McCollamcal the ship-from-storein in Februari 2016 ""one of the most import and strateg decis in (Best Buy's) history.""Th number don't lie. In November, Best Buydeliv strongstrong Q3 2017 result that includ continu growth for it e-commerc busi along with posit same-stor sale growth. It' taken multi-channel retail to the next level.Whi Appl Inc. (AAPL) Will Becom a Trillion-Dollar Company""Best Buy' third quarter onlin growth of over 24% result in a veri solid quarter, and continu to valid the company' multi-channel transformation,"" Moody' lead retail analyst Charli O'Sheasaid in November.Renew Blue' been such a success that retail expert Walter Loeb name Joli hi 2016 Retail of the Year.Bottom Line on AMZN StockBi acquir Macy's, AMZN would be abl to push it product onto the store floor where it could learn more about what apparel shopper want, while serious lower it ship expens by implement a ship-from-stor initi much like Best Buy.Yes, it' alreadi invest billion in warehous across the country, but get closer to the custom is never a bad thing; buy Macy' might not happen but if it does, it' got noth to do with own real estat and everyth to do with AMZN own the customer.A of thi writing, Will Ashworth did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlaceElon Musk Is Drill a Hole in Tesla Inc (TSLA) StockTh Bank of America Corp (BAC) Stock Ralli Is Near It End7 Stock That Will Hit All-Tim High in 2017The postCould Amazon.com, Inc.

Why Apple Inc. (AAPL) Will Become a Trillion-Dollar Company,3/1/2017,"InvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsTh market is make new high seemingli everi day. TheS&P 500,Nasdaq Compositeand other major indic are in unchart territory, and the stock that valu investor doubt is follow suit.Appl Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) is now worth $720 billion by market capitalization. And improbably, the $1 trillion mark - at $189 per share for AAPL stock, that' still a lofti 40% away - is at least in the realm of possibl now.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockAlso improbably, Appl stock, at around 16 time earnings, is somewher between undervalu and fairli valued. Warren Buffett'sBerkshir Hathaway Inc.(NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B) still believ in the valu proposition, ad AAPL share in the most recent quarter, accord to Berkshire's13-F filing.Morgan Stanley ha rais it target price on AAPL stock to $154. UB say Appl share are worth $138. So the analyst are on board too.But $189?How Can Appl Hit $1 Trillion?If Appl trade at $189 per share without ani of it financi changing, that would assum a P/E that ha climb to about 22 time earnings. That higher multipl would have to reflect investor expect that iPhon 7 sale are growing, though more likely, that the iPhon 8 will be a smash hit.7 Stock That Will Hit All-Tim High in 2017That' plausible, consid the woe ofSamsung's(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) Galaxi Note 7 fiasco, not to mention strong first-quart iPhon sales.Anoth way to look at it is through the revenu lens.Look ahead, Appl project second-quart revenu of between $51.5 billion-$53.5 billion and gross margin in the rang of 38%-39%. The $1 trillion market cap would valu the stock at 4 time sales, up from 3.3 times. And it seem unlik that investor would trade Appl to those kind of multipl without anyth els happening.Appl need iPhon sale to grow more than the 5% year-over-year figur last quarter. It certainli need iPad to revers a 19% YOY drop in revenue. Services, though, is a huge bright spot, grow revenu from 18% YOY, and the segment is acceler to becom a bigger piec of the revenu pie. Continu that track would certainli help AAPL' chances.iPhon 8 ReleaseTh biggest continu headlin thi year is Apple' 10th anniversari iPhon release, believ to be call either the iPhon 8 or theiPhon X.Currently, while the market is optimist about AAPL stock, it' not price in the potenti for double-digit revenu growth in iPhon sale on the back of iPhon 8. That would also includ revers the iPhone' slow sale in China.Anything' possibl in China right now, though.Xiaomi wa the leader in Chines smartphon market share in China in Q1 of 2015. In 2016, Huawei and Oppo took the first and second spot, respectively, in China. Apple' posit drop sharpli to thefifth spot. However, cut price of the iPhon 7 and promot that particular model in the region could help AAPL compet more effectively.Anoth Note About ValuationEven if Appl doesn't blow the door off with iPhon 8 sales, the market isn't against reward gigant tech titan without them boast breakneck growth.Microsoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) trade at a P/E of 30 and P/ of 6. P/E and 6x sale (price/sales). Still, Microsoft is expect to grow earn by about 7% compar to Apple' 7.6% expect growth thi year, and next year the dispar expands, with analyst project 13.5% profit growth from Appl but just 9.4% from Microsoft.Speak of corpor softwar titans, Appl ha partner withIntern Busi Machin Corp.(NYSE:IBM) to develop corpor software. In time, Appl will gener more meaning revenu from thi space.Bottom LineLastly, we'll discuss Apple' giant war chest. AAPL ha $246 billion in cash, or around $30 a share in net cash. Assum a 15% repatri tax (which in theori could go away with aTrump repatri tax holiday), AAPL will have $23 per share in cash.Thi is the company' buyback activ last quarter:""W return almost $15 billion to investor dure a veri busi Decemb quarter for our capit return activities. We paid $3.1 billion in dividend and equivalents. We spent $5 billion on repurchas of 44.3 million Appl share through open market transactions.

Make No Mistake: Tesla Inc Looks To Be Winding Down SolarCity's Ambitious Plans,2/28/2017,"WhenTesla Inc(NASDAQ: TSLA) bought SolarC for $2.6 billion late in 2016, a lot of peopl (includ myself) call the deal a bailout of Elon Musk' high-profil solar company. The deal didn't seem to do anyth to advanc Tesla' electr vehicl (EV) business, it will be a drain on cash, and it wa a huge distract given the business-model chang and manufactur expans SolarC had undertaken.Fourth-quart result from Tesla releas after the market close on Wednesday didn't do a lot to chang the narr that SolarC and Tesla are still a strang fit together. In fact, it could be argu that Tesla is wind down some of SolarCity' business. Here' how to look at Tesla' solar result last quarter.Tesla' solar roof is under develop at the same time SolarCity' busi is shrinking. Imag source: Tesla.makeArticleAd();Th shrink solar ambit of TeslaSolarC ha been reduc it instal guidanc for a year now, so it shouldn't be shock that Tesla' result fell way short of expectations. At the start of 2016, SolarC expect to instal 1,250 MW of solar in 2016. By the end of the third quarter, the compani had reduc guidanc to 900 MW, impli about 300 MW of instal in the fourth quarter.In reality, SolarC and Tesla instal 201 MW in the fourth quarter and hit just 803 MW of instal for 2016. Thi is an incred disappoint result and the fourth quarter is tradit a peak for the compani as peopl tri to get year-end tax incentives.Th move to sale from leas is good, right?Tesla tout the $77 million in cash gener dure the final six week of the year and the sale of 28% of solar systems, rather than capital-intens leases. And on the surfac both look good, but that may not be the case.Th cash gener includ tax equiti fund be rais that will be lumpi from quarter to quarter, so it isn't as if you can extrapol $77 million in cash gener dure those six week into a cash flow project for the year. In fact, manag said on the confer call that SolarCity' leas busi would hope have no impact on it cash posit thi year.What' more concern is that the energi gener and storag line item on the incom statement show just $3.6 million in gross margin for the quarter to $131.4 million in revenue, or a 2.7% gross margin. By comparison, SolarC gener a 35.7% gross margin for the third quarter of 2016. Thi could tell us that slow sale didn't offset higher costs, energi storag margin are low or negative, or that solar system sale are incred low margin. No matter what the cause, a margin that bad can't be good.Th move to sale will also come with more competition. A custom may be more like to shop around to find the best price if Tesla is sell system for cash, which will like lead to lower margins.Rememb that SolarC came with over $1 billion in run rate annual oper expenses, which have to be paid for with the gross profit from run the business. If profit margin are terrible, it could lead to the solar busi be a cash sink for Tesla long-term.I SolarCity' instal arm in trouble?Tesla is talk a lot about turn the solar busi into a more sales-focus busi and get away from leas (more of a necess than a choice, in reality). If Tesla is go to move to a more opportunist sale model through it retail stores, it would make more sens to contract instal through local contractor that will be the boot on the ground, leav Tesla to act as a sale and engin company. Thi isn't uncommon, like whenHom DepotorLowe'ssel a kitchen setup orTol Brothersbuild a house, they use local compani to do the actual work.But that could entail Tesla lay off thousand of instal and salespeopl who were onc at the heart of the business. But it look like that' what Tesla is set up to do, and when you look at the $1 billion in oper costs, it' the thousand of worker that SolarC had on the payrol that add a ton of risk to Tesla' operations.Tesla hasn't made ani announc yet, but with the scale back of solar ambit and the move to start sell solar system through Tesla stores, it would make sens to jettison the instal arm. And the slowdown in instal last quarter may be in anticip of the change.Powerwall. Imag source: Tesla.What is Tesla do with solar manufacturing?Musk and Co. talk a lot about solar manufactur on Wednesday and dub the Buffalo solar plant Gigafactori 2. Time will tell if Tesla will be abl to make solar panel cost-effectively, but even if it can, the low output and potenti transit of instal might be a problem for the plant.When the state of New York gave SolarC a$750 million subsidi to build the Buffalo plant, it came with a requir to ""employ 1,460 high-tech job for the manufactur operation"" as well as ""employ at least 2,000 other personnel in the State of New York to support downstream solar panel sale and instal for five years."" Thi is on top of 1,440 support and contractor job that SolarC wa suppos to indirectli provide. Tesla may have a hard time hit that commit if it scale back on it instal fleet.On a more fundament level, Tesla' move into solar manufactur is confus and disappointing. I don't know whi the compani would want to be in the highli competit solar manufactur business, where dozen of compani have gone bankrupt. And the company' Silevo acquisition, which drove the move into manufacturing, happen in June of 2014, and we still haven't seen ani sort of manufactur at scale. There are promis that the second half of the year will see solar panel with Panason technolog start roll out along with the solar roof, but until we see product, spec sheets, and pricing, investor should be skeptical.Tesla isn't make a big bet on solarWith all of these factor considered, it' safe to say that Tesla is scale back SolarCity' solar growth ambit and may even be shrink the busi altogether. And long-term, that might be the right move given the tough econom in residenti solar.Investor should keep an eye on the transit Tesla is make to more cash solar sale and solar at retail store to see how strong the invest in solar realli is -- and what the return are. It may just be a bolt-on product made to make electr car look cooler, which may not be the worst thing at the end of the day, all thing considered.10 stock we like better than TeslaWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Forget Goldman and Go Long Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock,2/28/2017,"InvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsAft a fast start to 2017,Tesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) ha experienc a sharp U-turn. In our estimation, however, it may be time to buckl up and take a test drive in TSLA stock use a modifi spread that will keep investor safer than the competit can. Let me explain.makeArticleAd();It almost appear TSLA stock knew how to do just one thing thi year: drag the Tesla short higher and higher, as share power forward by nearli 26% in under two month at last week' highs.Tesla' strong ralli came despit the compani have it share of insult and threats. From cash burn, worri of anoth secondary, increas risk under a less-subsidi friendli Trump administr and auto competitor gain traction in the EV car market, investor ignor or shook off a good deal of potenti bearish catalysts.Then came earnings; TSLA stock skid lower by roughli 6.5% in the report' immedi aftermath. A wider-than-expect loss of 69 cent per share, surpris departur by Tesla' CFO and failur to ramp up deliver guidanc all contribut to investors' less carefre outlook.Build over the past coupl session despit assur by management, there' also increas specul Tesla will delay it Model 3 rollout. The much-anticip launch is suppos to challengeGener Motor Company's(NYSE:GM) electr vehicl Chevi Bolt, which wa recent named""Car of the Year""at the Detroit Auto Show.7 Best Stock to Buy for a Donald Trump Green LightNow, there' also Goldman Sachs'downgrad of TSLA stock.Th invest bank cut share to 'sell' from 'neutral,' cite most all the neg alreadi outlin and estim Tesla ha skew risk to the downside. Have said that, Goldman isn't alway spot-on when it come totim recommendationson TSLA stock.Tesla Stock Weekli ChartClick to EnlargeSo is it time to appli the brake to Tesla' bump in the road or take a backseat behind Goldman?A the weekli chart of TSLA stock shows, share have enter an area of potenti technic support and offer a lower-risk spot to buy shares. However, there are no guarante when it come to buy stock and exit gracefully.Currently, Tesla ha seen a common correct move of 16% that' test the 38% retrac level, as well as a coupl support line I'v drawn on the price chart. The pullback look more meaning as it' also challeng the recent key breakout point on the weekli chart, which I wrote about back onJan. 11.Less favorable, the stochast indic isn't confirm a bottom and ha just turn lower from an overbought condition. The lack of support, though, isn't entir surpris given the sturdi price run befor earn and quick decline. Yet, it is still view as a modest neg for buy into Tesla stock with greater conviction.TSLA Stock Modifi Bullish Condor SpreadGiven what' been said and the situat surround Tesla sinc earnings, I don't mind give away some out-of-the-money upsid potenti to help reduc the risk associ with pay for a limited-risk spread. My view is that Tesla can ralli from here, but new high in the near-term would like prove challenging. At the same time, I want to cover my ""you know what"" in the event Tesla stock fail to hold support on the price chart.On modifi spread that fit these paramet nice is the April $250/$260/$270/$275 call condor. With share at $246.23, the packag $10 bull call spread and tighter $5 bear vertic cost around $2.70.The breakeven at April expir is $252.70 and requir TSLA to be modestli higher by about 2.6%. Abov $260 and all the way up to $270, the max profit from the bull vertic translat into a profit of $7.30. Below $250, the entir debit will be forfeited.Play Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Befor It Swing Back NorthFrom $270 to $275 the smaller $5 bear spread begin to eat into those gain dollar-for-dollar, but ultim would leav thi trader with $2.30 in net profit abov $275 in Tesla stock.Bottom line, the impos limit on upsid is squar in TSLA stock' pre-earn and more euphor price action. And in our view, it' a nice trade-off for help reduc downsid risk dure the life of thi spread.Invest account under Christoph Tyler' manag do not current own posit in ani of the secur or their deriv mention in thi article.

"BP plc (ADR) (BP) Stock Can Ride Out Low Oil Prices, But …",2/28/2017,"InvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsBP plc (ADR)(NYSE:BP) is among sever oil stock have a difficult time in 2017. The price of oil ha move up and down as investor tri to discern demand for oil against the suppli that energi produc bring to market. Presently, there appear to be plenti of supply, and thi is depress price - includ in BP stock, which is off 9% thi year.makeArticleAd();Source:Mik Mozart via FlickrOil price have recent ralli to nearli $55 per barrel. A recent report detail that the inventori of crude oil in the U.S. drop to 512.7 million barrels, and OPEC, the larg intern oil cartel that essenti control the overal level of oil and ga product in the world, is tri to reduc supply.Unfortunately, both oil and natur ga price remain depressed. Oil is a far cri from the $100 per barrel it trade at just a coupl of year ago. At a current price nearli half that high, the largest player in the industri - such as BP stock - are struggl to turn a profit and gener enough cash flow to sustain pay dividend while continu to explor for even more oil.Th key problem with invest in oil and ga stock is the difficulti in predict where oil price are heading. Thi uncertainti ha hit the share price of the industry' largest companies. I have been cover industri giantExxon Mobil Corporation(NYSE:XOM) insom detail and have found that it high dividend yield is great consol as manag come to term with the fact that oil and ga price are depressed, and are like to remain low for some time.Th 10 Best Oil Stock to Buy Now for Big-Tim GainsExxon' current dividend yield is 3.68%, and XOM stock is hover close to it low point over the past year. But, sinc we'r get paid to wait, whi not gun for a competitor with an even higher yield?BP is a compet energi giant with a current dividend yield of 7.06%. Share are also bump against 52-week lows, and BP stock trade at a reason forward P/E near 15x.In contrast, Exxon stock trade closer to 19 time earn estim for thi year.BP Ha a Cash Flow ProblemBP' predica is similar to Exxon's, in that it' current spend more than it makes. Back in February, manag report 2016 results. Oper cash flow wa $10.7 billion, but the compani spent $16.7 billion to explor for and produc oil and ga (the upstream business), as well as refin it into chemic and relat commod (the downstream business).Further, BP sold asset and busi to bring in approxim $2.6 billion, but still didn't gener enough cash to support it sharehold dividend. Last year, it paid out $4.7 billion in dividends, which wa well below the $6.7 billion paid in 2015.Manag plan to continu straighten out the company' financ thi year. BP plan to cut capex to nearli $16 billion and expect to rais as much as $5.5 billion by sell more asset and businesses.However, the compani still ha to pay out billion relat to the Deepwat Horizon debacl in the Gulf of Mexico. In 2017, the payout should rang between $4.5 billion-$5.5 billion.For investor concern about BP' cash flow predicament, consid that the compani can like ride out ani extend period of low oil and ga prices. Sale thi year should exceed $233 billion, and the compani boast total asset north of $263 billion. BP' bond are invest grade, and there' alway the chanc that energi commod price will rally.Bottom Line on BP StockFor the price of BP stock to ralli from current levels, the sooner cash flow break even, the better. There could also be posit develop on the Deepwat Horizon front, includ addit settlement or reduct in futur payments.Exxon Mobil Corpor (XOM) Should Keep an Eye on Tesla Inc (TSLA)Of course, if oil price do ralli abov $60, BP stock will move upward in sympathy. Few strategist expect thi to happen ani time soon, but veri few predict oil would drop precipit from $100 in late 2014 and bottom out at close to $30 per barrel in earli 2016.A basket approach, or invest in a hand of the largest energi player in the world, make sens in today' environment. Exxon still ha a reput as one of the best capit allocators. BP is also up there, and though it oil spill liabil remain a huge headache, it still ha the financi strength to support one of the highest dividend yield in the industry.A of thi writing, Ryan Fuhrmann did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlaceBo Co (BA) Stock Is Soar on Trump' CoattailsTarget Corpor (TGT) Stock Is Even Wors Than Q4 Earn Suggest7 REIT That Should Be CondemnedTh postBP plc (ADR) (BP) Stock Can Ride Out Low Oil Prices, But …appear first onInvestorPlace."

Boeing' revenu peak in 2015, fall last year by approxim $500 million, with earn per share rise onli becaus buyback cut the float from 695 million share to 642.8 million.But, you don't buy or sell stock base on yesterday - you buy or sell them base on tomorrow. You can argu that tomorrow look veri good for Boe stock, with increas nation lead to more militari orders, the increas effici of new jet lead to more domest orders, and the increas support of the Trump Administr lead to more profit.Bo also face a growing, albeit competit market in outer space, where it hope toautom the product of satellitesand compet with start-up likeSpaceX, with shorter product cycles.Should You Buy BA Stock?Analyst are divid on Boe stock, with10 call it a buy and 9 call it a hold, while 3 now call it a sell.Mi own view is that, while the upsid on BA stock may be limit - even our own Sam Collin is just look for a 10% bump to $200 from here - incom investor should be veri interested, as the new dividend of $1.42 per share is a 3.21% yield at current prices.Leav Sear Hold Corp (SHLD) Stock to the SavagesWhat you think of Boeing, in other words, depend less on what you think of Trump than what you want for yourself.

Why Tesla's Model 3 Production Plans Could Go Awry,2/28/2017,"Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) is gear up to put it first true mass-market product, the Model 3 sedan, into production. If all goe well, the first product Model 3s will roll down a brand-new assembl line in July.It' a huge step for the Silicon Valley automaker. The Model 3 will be produc in much higher volum than anyth that Tesla ha tri to build so far. And becaus it' a mass-market product, the qualiti expect will be extraordinarili high.W know that Tesla ha been spend heavili on an elabor revamp of it Fremont, California factori as it gear up to put the Model 3 into production. Last week, CEO Elon Musk gave us a look into how the compani plan to ramp up it product line.makeArticleAd();Tesla' upcom Model 3 sedan, shown in concept form last year. Imag source: Tesla.A gradual ramp-up through the first three month of production""I feel pretti confid that we should get there by the end of thi year, to 5,000 a week,"" Musk told analyst dure Tesla' fourth-quart earn call. Musk went on to outlin the product schedul that Tesla ha given it part suppliers:1,000 per week in July;2,000 per week in August;4,000 per week in September;5,000 per week by the end of the year.Keep in mind that that schedul is for part deliveri to Tesla' factori in Fremont, California. As Musk point out, it will take time to turn those part into finish car as Tesla work to get it brand-new assembl line run -- and it'll take more time to deliv those car to customers.Th ""term-pap problem"" that could throw off the scheduleBut even factor in those assumptions, Musk warn that the Model 3 ramp-up could be slow further by what he call the ""term-pap problem"":I wa a teach assist in college, and no matter what date we set the exam paper for, when the term paper wa due, it' alway like there are peopl that are late. It' just the way it goes. Peopl are sometim -- and I'm guilti of thi too -- too optimist about the timing, or they get unlucky.Tesla ha set strict deliveri date with it suppliers, but Musk said that he know that some number of them might well be late. Even if it' just 1%, those late part could throw a big wrench into Tesla' ambiti product ramp-up schedule.

It's Official: These Are the 3 Most Ludicrously Overvalued Stocks on the Market,2/28/2017,"The stock market is, for lack of a better word, imperfect. While we as investor would love for thing to be entir ration (for example, earn growth translat into orderli stock-buy and the subsequ appreci of stock valuations), that' not alway what happens.A number of factors, includ emot and even X factor that can't be foreseen ahead of time, can influenc stock valuations. Sometim these ancillari factor can push stock valuat except low, which present an intrigu buy opportun for Wall Street and investors. On the other side of the coin, emot and X factor can also push stock valuat into the stratosphere, well beyond the point where ani ration fundament theorist would dare go. At ani given time, there are almost alway go to be a few stock that fall into the latter categori of be ludicr overvalued.Thre compani that'll have fundament investor say ""No thanks!"" Imag source: Getti Images.makeArticleAd();Though valuat is an entir arbitrari process for each investor, the follow three compani stand out for their frighten valuat compar to what they bring to the table.Tesla Inc.It may not be a popular opinion, but one stock I'd crown as overvalu -- ludicr so -- is electric-vehicl and solar-panel-instal companyTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) .What I will give Tesla is this: It' the first car compani in decad to realli build itself from the ground up and disrupt Detroit' big three automakers. The demand for Tesla' Model S and X, as well as initi order for it cheaper Model 3 sedan, have been phenomen and demonstr the desir of American to own cleaner vehicles.But what look to be a good idea on paper ha yet to translat into profits. Just day ago Tesla report a 79% increas in automot fourth-quart revenue, but it still deliv an adjust net loss of $106.6 million. Sure, that wa a 60% narrow adjust net loss from the prior-year quarter, but it' still a loss. In fact, the compani burn through more than $448 million in cash flow dure Q4 as it continu to ramp up the Gigafactori in prepar for the Model 3. Tesla end the year with $3.39 billion in cash and cash equivalents, but ha plan to spend $2 billion to $2.5 billion in capit expenditur in 2017. In other words, yet anoth cash rais may be in order.Th Tesla Model 3. Imag source: Tesla Inc.Tesla' solar busi -- it acquir SolarC less than two month ago -- also languished. Tesla report 201 MW of solar instal in Q4, which wa almost 100 MW lower than what SolarC had previous guid for. It' no secret that solar ha been weak, but these figur are except weak.A simpl comparison ofGener Motors(NYSE: GM) and Tesla realli show how out in left field Tesla' valuat is at the moment. In 2016, Gener Motor sold nearli 10 million vehicl and gener nearli $9.12 billion in profit. In fact, it' current valu at roughli six time it trail 12-month earnings. By comparison, Tesla produc onli around 90,000 vehicl and is lose money hand over fist, and it $41 billion valuat impli a market valu of almost $500,000 per car! GM' $56 billion valuat and annual product of 10 million impli a valuat of approxim $5,600 per car produced. That differ is insane. Even with the two compani have veri differ busi models, I don't see whi ani fundament investor in their right mind would choos Tesla over GM.Northern Dynasti Miner Ltd.Just becaus a stock ha a small-cap valuat doesn't mean it can't still be ludicr overvalued. Next on the list is highli volatil developmental-stag mine companyNorthern Dynasti Minerals(NYSEMKT: NAK) .In recent months, Northern Dynasti Minerals' share have caught fire with the expect that the Trump administr would eas rule set in place by the Environ Protect Agency, possibl allow the compani to be permit for the Pebbl Project in Alaska. In theory, Pebbl ha enough asset in the ground to keep a mine compani busi for upward of 100 years. Gold andsilv pricesar also up nice over the past two months.Imag source: Getti Images.Unfortunately, Northern Dynasty' dream of develop seem to be more of a fairi tale. One of the bigger issu with Pebbl is that the infer asset in the ground are spread out. While abundant, mani of these asset just haven't appear to be econom feasibl to recover. What' more, Northern Dynasti ha alreadi spent hundr of million just to get to the point where it' tri to determin if there are econom viabl area to mine in Pebble. Don't believ me? Here' a direct statement from the company' third-quart report:Th Group' continu oper and underli valu and recover of the amount shown for the Group' miner properti interests, is entir depend upon the exist of econom recover miner reserves.Mak matter worse, Northern Dynasti Miner ha nowher near the capit requir to develop Pebbl into a commerci viabl oper (assum recoveri is even econom feasible). At the end of the third quarter, the compani had less than $6 million in cash and cash equival left, although it did gener more than $32 million from a secondari offer in Januari 2017. Even so, thi is laughabl far off from the year and billion of dollar it would seemingli take to get Pebbl up to commerci production.Hav been previous abandon befor by compani with pocketbook that were far deeper than Northern Dynasti Minerals', Pebbl is like a dead duck, and Northern Dynasty' stock is potenti worthless.Snap Inc.Finally, even though it' not even offici public yet, Snapchat parentSnap Inc.(NYSE: SNAP) get my vote for be ludicr overvalued.On one hand, I can understand the allur of a compani like Snap consid how wellFacebook(NASDAQ: FB) ha perform sinc it went public. In just three years, Snap ha essenti tripl it daili activ user from around 50 million to 158 million, and with the somewhat recent addit of advertis revenue, Snap' top line is surging. It gener $404.5 million in sale in 2016 after just $58 million in revenu in 2015. If Snap can use innov new ad-target tool to reach a rapidli grow number of users, itcouldb Facebook 2.0, or so some pundit suggest.Imag source: Snap Inc.However, as ha been the theme here, I'd like to disagree. Snap' expect IPO price range, accord to the company, valu it as aggress as $22 billion. At $22 billion, Snap is be valu at 54.4 time it total sales. I'm go to go ahead and repeat that for you who are skimming. That' 54 (fifty-four!) time sales. By comparison, Facebook andTwitterar current valu at 14.2 and 4.5 time sales, respectively.What' more, compani like Facebook have altern revenu channels. Snap onli began gener revenu from advertis two year ago, so it' entir reliant on ad to gener it sales.Of course, the coup de grace for Snap is that in spite of $404.5 million in sales, it wound up lose $514.6 million in 2016. Thi hark back to the dot-com bubbl days, when compani simpli spent everi ounc of capit they had and assum the economi and internet growth would buffer their risk-taking. At some point Wall Street is go to again shun compani that can't turn a profit (ahem, Tesla!), and I certainli wouldn't want ani part of Snap when that day comes.10 stock we like better than TeslaWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The Big Factor That Will Help Tesla's Model 3 Launch,2/27/2017,"Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) is gear up for mayb it biggest moment yet: the start of product of it first true mass-market model, the Model 3.It' a moment that is fraught with challenges. The Model 3 is all-new and differ from earlier Teslas, and it' go to be built on an all-new assembl line that incorpor much more autom than anyth Tesla ha tri to date.A lot ride on Tesla' abil todeliv high-qual Model 3s, and there are a lot of thing that could go wrong. But as CEO Elon Musk explain dure Tesla' earn call last week, Tesla ha an import new factor work in it favor: it suppliers.makeArticleAd();Tesla' upcom Model 3 sedan, shown in concept form last year. Imag source: Tesla.Tesla is reap the benefit of it growth with suppliersAl automakers, big or small, are heavili depend on suppliers. In particular, supplier that special in certain type of part -- whether circuit board or seat -- can produc part to a higher level of qualiti much less expens than an automak could do on it own.Musk said that in Tesla' earli days, it wa hard to get the attent of the establish auto-industri suppliers. Those supplier are use to think in term of product run that will go into six or seven figur of volum -- and few in the auto industri thought Tesla' Model S would end up sell in the ten of thousand everi year.But now that Tesla ha proven that it can (and will) build and sell car in volume, the supplier are much more interest in win it business. Musk explained:We'r abl to get usual the A team at the A supplier for Model 3. It' rare that we'r not abl to get that. Whereas, particularli for Model S and to some degre for Model X, when we were tri to get supplier for Model S, a lot of the top-tier supplier wouldn't even work with us. They didn't believ in the car. They thought we'd go bankrupt.Hav shown the result of the Model S and the Model X, the interest from supplier went from basic get like the worst team on second-ti supplier to get the best team on first-tier suppliers. It' realli a big difference.It should make a huge differ in some of the detail of the finish product. Think of thing like the fit and finish of interior panels, or the comfort of the seats, or the qualiti of the glass use in the windshield. These are all thing that drew some critic in the earlier Teslas, and they'r all thing that can be improv by have the A-list supplier give their best efforts.If the Model 3' launch is smooth, supplier will be a big reasonThere' a lot -- awholelot -- that can go wrong with Tesla' ramp-up to full product of the Model S. Some thing will go wrong: A few supplier will be late, a few earli batch of part won't fit properly, a robot or tool on Tesla' brand-new product line won't work as designed.Thes thing happen to all automakers. They'r more like to happen to Tesla with the Model 3, simpli becaus thi is the company' first-ev attempt at a high-volum product car.Analyst have look to the problem-plagu launch of Tesla' Model X for clue as to how the Model 3 launch might unfold (and have downgrad their near-term expect accordingly). But the fact that Tesla ha been abl to significantli upgrad it relationship with supplier sinc the X' launch might make that a mislead comparison.Long stori short: I think the Model 3 launch could go more smoothli than mani expect. If so, supplier will be a big reason why.10 stock we like better than TeslaWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Why Does Honda's Electric Car Have Just 80 Miles of Range?,2/27/2017,"The upcom battery-electr Clariti sedan fromHonda(NYSE: HMC) will come with a big surprise, accord to a new report: a rang of just 80 miles.That' the word from trade publicationAutomot Newsin a report that wa more or less confirm by Honda officials.That seem woefulli inadequ by 2017 standards. What is Honda thinking?makeArticleAd();Th upcom Honda Clariti Electr is expect to look veri similar to the 2017 Honda Clariti Fuel Cell sedan releas late last year. Imag source: Honda Motor Co., Ltd.Whi such a short range?At an expect start price of around $35,000, the Clariti Electr will be in direct competit (in term of price, at least) withGener Motors'(NYSE: GM) Chevrolet Bolt EV andTesla's(NASDAQ: TSLA) upcom Model 3 sedan. But the Bolt ha an EPA-r rang of 238 miles, and the Model 3' rang is expect to be in the same ballpark. Whi didn't the Clarity' rang at least come close to it rivals?Honda execut told Automot News that the Clariti Electric' short rang wa a byproduct of the company' decis to base it on the platform of the midsiz Clariti Fuel Cell,introduc last year. The Clariti Fuel Cell is a midsiz sedan, about the size of Honda' Accord. It' consider bigger than the Bolt.Th size and design of the Clariti platform, which will also be share with a plug-in hybrid version, didn't leav room (physic or financially) for a larger, longer-rang batteri pack without a hefti cost increase, they said.Whi Honda commit to a three-Clar strategyHonda explain last year that the idea behind theClarity' three-drivetrain strategyi that it will give Honda flexibl to vari the product mix as the market and infrastructur evolves. It also allow Honda' custom to choos their prefer path to an ""ultra-low carbon vehicl that meet their lifestyl needs,"" in Honda' words.I think the busi decis flow probabl look like this:Aft year of build tini number of fuel-cel vehicl for test markets, Hondawantedto do a fuel-cel car that could be market to a somewhat wider audience.Und pressur from investor (and mayb it dealers), Honda felt itneededto offer a midsiz battery-electr car -- if onli to show that it could be competit in that realm.Honda thendecidedto add a plug-in hybrid version that wa like to sell in much greater number than either of the other versions, in order to give the Clariti a better chanc of turn a profit.Th problem is, when you design one car around three veri differ drivetrains, a lot of compromis have to be made. And the Clariti Electric' rival are much less compromis designs.Th cost of compromis on a battery-electr carTesla ha shown the world what can be done when a car is design from the ground up around a battery-electr drivetrain. A vehicl design from the start around electr motor and a big batteri pack can have plenti of range, good handling, a roomi interior, and lot of cargo space.Th Chevi Bolt doesn't look like a Tesla, but like the Teslas, it wa design from the start as a battery-electr vehicle. It doesn't have the rang or speed of the big Teslas, but it ha someth els enabl by it battery-electr packaging: A surprisingli roomi interior enclos in a small, nimbl vehicl perfect for citi driving.It' no coincid that the Tesla and the Bolt are the current gold standard of battery-electr vehicles. And it' sad that Honda, which ha spent year build up it green-car credibility, ha settl for a compromis design with the Clariti Electric.But will it sell?Som folk say rang doesn't matter all that much, and the Clariti Electr will find buyer attract to it size and Honda' reput for qualiti and durability. I'm skeptical: I think the plug-in hybrid version of the Clariti -- or an Accord Hybrid -- is like to win over most of the green-mind Honda loyalist who might have taken a chanc on a Clariti Electr with greater range.It' like Honda will share more detail about the Clariti Electr at the New York Intern Auto Show in April.

They are expect to increas their stake to 50% from 42%. Paytm last year spun off it payment busi to compli with regulations. One97 hold a 49% stake in Paytm Payment Bank and Paytm founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma own 51%.Paytm boasted177 million usersat the end of the year and CFO Madhur Deora ha set a medium-term target of 500 million user . That growth would be a boost for Alibaba stock and Ant Financi which seeks2 billion user worldwideov the next decade.7 Best Stock to Buy for a Donald Trump Green LightPaytm is clearli take a page out of Alibaba and Ant Financial' playbook. Like BABA'sMyBank- the bank ""for the littl guy"" - Paytm' bank promis to be a vehicl for financi inclusion, bring servic to India' unbanked.Lik Ant, Paytm also want to offer loan andasset manag servicesto those who can't access them now.Ant Fortune, a wealth manag app, debut in 2015. It user can put money in Yuebao, a money market fund, and invest inZhao Cai Bao, where they can loan money directli to businesses.Paytm' Threat to BanksBank in both countri are threaten by thi disruption. Ant' Yuebao offer depositor higher interest rate than bank andinst withdrawals. Technolog compani don't have to maintain as mani employe at branch as bank do, and can link borrow and saver directly. Their asset-light model is simpli more effici than that of exist banks, which have to use their own capital, and are burden by legaci system and regulation.Bank earn a profit on the spread, the differ between the rate at which they lend and the rate they offer depositors. Platform that connect borrow and lender and cut out the middleman can exert pressur on this. And becaus Paytm and Ant Financi are branchless, they have lower overhead costs, and can offer lower fee than banks.Paytm will be both a friend and a potenti enemi to banks. It will help them drum up busi by cross-sel their servic to it users. But Paytm will probabl be the front-end in custom interact and releg the bank to the back end .Bank risk becom ""dumb pipes.""

AMcKinsey & Companystudi found that bank earn a 22% return on equiti from sale and origination, but onli 6% from the extens of credit.Protection RisksAl of thi doesn't mean that the success of Alibaba, Ant and Paytm is guaranteed. Some risk still stand in the way.First, protectionist sentiment is rise in India asAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) andUberclobb their Indian rivals. Indian startup such as Flipkart, Snapdeal (in which BABA is an investor), and Ola have had their valuat repeatedli mark down over the past year. Now some are ask for protect against supposedli unfair foreign competition. Indian ventur capitalist Vani Kola of Kalaari Capit call for such measures, follow bysimilar sentimentfrom the founder of e-commerc player Flipkart and Ola, view as India' home-grown Uber) .Sinc Paytm is an Indian company, whi would thi be a concern? While Paytm is Indian, it largest sharehold are Chinese, Alibaba and Ant. Would India want such a compani control someth as critic as it payment infrastructure? Expert have rais concern overPaytm user dataend up in server outsid of India.Point to Paytm' Chines ties, the chief minist of West Bengal, Mamata Banerje accus the prime minist ofcompromis nation security.

Under Armour Inc (UA) Stock Offers the Easiest Profits Ever,2/27/2017,"InvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsLost in the collaps ofUnd Armour Inc(NYSE:UA) stock over the past year is an odd diverg between two class of stock.

Class C UA stock ha no vote rights. Class A UAA stock doe have vote right of one vote per share. But those right don't have much value. CEO and founder Kevin Plank own all of the non-trad Class B shares, which have 10 vote each, give Plank 65% of the vote power as of Decemb 2016.UAA sharehold are pay a premium for vote which are larg symbolic. And it' not as if other consider justifi that gap. The market is figur out the divergence, as the 10% premium ha narrow of late. But there' still time for easi profit in short UAA and go long UA.A for investor bullish on Under Armour, there' basic no reason to pay up for the UAA stock.No, UAA Stock Isn't Worth More Than UA StockA seen in the chart below, the gap between UA and UAA ha narrow of late, after peak in November.7 Best Stock to Buy for a Donald Trump Green LightAt one point in late Novemb - less than a year after the Class C UA stock wa issu - the gap wa over 20%, a huge number. In dollars, the differ ha drop to near $2 per share from as high as $7 - but some of that compress ha come from the fact that Under Armour stock ha declin precipit after two disappoint earn reports.With the larg symbol vote right not like to chang anytim soon, there' simpli veri littl reason for UA to trade abov UAA.Accord to theregistr statementfil by Under Armour with the SEC, Class C holder of Under Armour stock are entitl to the same dividends. The onli way for Class A sharehold to gain some sort of major vote power would be for Plank to be termin for caus or to give up hi shares.Neith outcom seem particularli like given that the CEO is 42 year old, intens competitive, and intent on turn around hi belov Under Armour himself.Liquid doesn't justifi the differ price for Under Armour stock, either, with one possibl exception.Ther wa a notabl diverg in equiti volum a few month ago. UA stock had an averag volum under 1 million share per day in October, roughli 20% of UAA stock. But volum over the past month is almost equal: 6.5 million share a day for UA and 6.9 million for UAA. The increas in UA volum probabl ha someth to do with the narrow premium and impli that the spread will continu to tighten.How To Play Under Armour StockTher is one notabl differ between UA and UAA: option volume. For instance, open interest in the UA Jan 2018 $20 put is just over 400. In contrast, there are more than 11,000 UAA Jan 2018 $20 call open at the moment.That differ is not enough to justifi a 10% premium, however, particularli for smaller investors. And it seem the market is figur that out. But the gap remain wide enough that there' still room to make what should be close to risk-fre profit by go long UA and short UAA.Nvidia Corpor (NVDA): Amaz Company, Not-So-Good Stock ... For NowAni major event - like an acquisition, as unlik as that seem at the moment - will treat sharehold equally. Ani dividend payment will be the same. The onli differ between UA and UAA is the opportun to vote even though those vote have no practic impact.So an arbitrag trade still look like it ha some upside. Vote right between class at other stock usual are below 5%, mean a long UA/short UAA trade could make anoth $1 per share with veri low risk.For investor who still think Under Armour stock is a better opportunity, then Class C UA stock is the right choice.

Critic acclaim both, but they weren't without their flaw in the month after they were launched.Both car had glitch (the S' door handles; the X' falcon-w doors) and while both had terrif technology, they both fell down in some more mundan respect (seats, road noise) when compar with similarli price model from establish luxury-car makers.That hasn't realli hurt. Tesla' early-adopt owner base, mani of whom are well-heeled, mostli hasn't minded. They'v been will to trade some rough edg for the privileg of be on what they see as the cut edg of automot technology.makeArticleAd();But now, Tesla is aim at a broader market with it upcom Model 3. To gener the sustain high sale the compani is targeting, the Model 3 ha to be abl to compar well on qualiti and refin with, yes, mass-market internal-combust alternatives. It also ha to be much easier to manufacture, becaus it price will leav less margin for error.Happily, CEO Elon Musk and the Tesla manag team know all of that. They'v taken some big step to ensur that the Model 3 is readi to carri Tesla' brand to a much wider audience.Tesla expect to begin product of the Model 3 in July. Imag source: Tesla.Th Model 3 incorpor big lesson learn from earlier Teslas""Th Model 3 is design with - it' realli design for manufacturing,"" Musk said dure Tesla' earn call last week. ""It' consider a simpler car than the Model S or the Model X.""Not onli doe it have fewer ""bell and whistles"" than Tesla' upscal models, he said, but it also reflect lesson learn from the complic and problem-plagu launch of the Model S and (especially) the Model X SUV.In design the Model 3, Tesla skip whiz-bang featur like the self-pres door handl and falcon-w door of it earlier model in favor of mechan simplic that would be easier to assembl at a high level of quality. It ha less wiring, fewer computers, and other simplif intend to make it easier to build at scale.CTO J.B. Straubel acknowledg that the experi of the Model X ramp-up impart some pain lessons:W realli learn a lot of lessons, especi from the difficult Model X ramp. That' someth that' in our recent memory, and we fought through it and succeeded. But I think in the design of the Model 3 and the system and the [production] line that produc it, mani of those learn have been incorpor from the beginning.Th amount of complex in the oper to assembl the car is dramat reduced. The amount of oper that involv some level of sort of assembl craft, where there' more judgment from the operator, are dramat reduced, almost eliminated. And a lot of these thing that we could identifi directli as the bottleneck that hurt us on the X ramp, we'v been abl to target specif and reduc or eliminate. So that ha -- though painful, it wa a veri help experi for us to get readi for Model 3.The hard lesson of the Model X led to three big hiresTesla had the benefit of some new and veri experienc perspect as it engin the Model 3 and prepar it product line. The compani made sever promis move to address it product qualiti in the wake of the Model X' launch, and three key hire stand out.Last May, Tesla hiredproduct expert Peter Hochholdinger, a veteran ofVolkswagen AG' Audi subsidiary. He ha appar ha had a major influenc onTesla' approach to design and engineeringth Model 3, as well as on Musk' (and Tesla's) think about the manufactur of electr vehicl more generally.Tesla' upcom Model 3 will incorpor the hard lesson learn from earli product of it Model X SUV. Imag source: Daniel Sparks/Th Motley FoolHochholding wa join in August by David Erhart, anAppleveteran who becam Tesla' senior director of reliabl engineering. Erhart is also thought to havehad a signific impact on the Model 3' engineering.Last but not least, Tesla wa abl to hireinterior-engin expert Ander Bellfrom Volvo Cars. Bell wa Volvo' head of interior engineering, and he led the team that creat the interior of Volvo' XC90, X90, and V90 models.Thes were all strong hires, and taken togeth they suggest that Tesla put much more effort into some key fundament with the Model 3.The upshot: The Model 3 should be a better-built TeslaMak no mistake: The Model S and Model X are extrem impress vehicles, especi given Tesla' size and resourc at the time they were launched. But that said, it ha been clear that manufacturing, reliability, and interior qualiti are all area where Tesla need to make improv befor enter the mass market with the Model 3.Clearly, Tesla came to the same conclus and took action.

But there are still a few sector that Mr. Market seem to have overlooked. One big one: auto stocks.Not all auto stock have been overlooked, of course. Silicon Valley' electric-car darling,Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) , get alotof attent from investors. It' obviou why: Tesla' stori is arguabl the futur of autos, unfold here in the present. Investor love that.Th thing is, Tesla isn't the onli compani move the auto industri from the gas-guzzl present to a connected, electrifi future. A few of the old automak are right in the cutting-edg mix, make smart, aggress move to thrive and profit as the industri transforms.makeArticleAd();To some extent, those stori are happen a bit below Wall Street' radar. Investor haven't yet caught on, in part becaus Tesla' stori ha overshadow the others.That' a prime recip for value. Here are two big-nam automak that are well-posit for the future, avail today at valu price -- both sport dividend yield over 4%.Ford Motor Company: Use pickup profit to transformWhen you think ofFord Motor Company(NYSE: F) , you might think about huge-sel pickup trucks, or Ford' dramat turnaround a few year ago.Y probabl aren't think about electr cars, self-driving, or new concept of person mobil that don't involv sell car to individuals. But CEO Mark Field and hi team, all battle-test veteran of that turnaround, are do a lot of think about all of those thing these days.Ford' super-profit pickup are help to fund electr car and new high-tech busi as the Blue Oval transforms. Imag source: Ford Motor Company.In fact, they'r do more than thinking. Last fall, Ford explain how it' transform itself into an ""automot and mobil company.""

(Click on each to learn more.)Ford is alreadi solidli profitable. It postedoper profit of $10.4 billion in 2016(it second-best ever) with a 6.7% oper profit margin in it auto-rel business. Ford' near-term goal is to get that margin up to a sustain 8% by invest in it strength (includ all thoseextrem profit pickup trucks) and boost the profit of it weaker line of business, likesmal carsand theresurg Lincoln luxuri brand.Ford plan to begin mass-produc self-driv car for fleet use in 2021. It may also sell it self-driv system to other automakers. Imag source: Ford Motor Company.That margin boost will in turn help fund Ford' new line of business. Those will be even more profitable: Ford is targetingoper margin of 20% or betterin each.Long stori short: Ford' bottom line is prime for signific growth over the next few years, much of it driven by technology. But right now, it' trade at just 7 time it adjust 2016 earnings, while pay averi sustainable4.8% dividend.Gener Motors: Jump ahead of Silicon ValleyI'v listedGener Motors(NYSE: GM) second onli becaus investor have start to catch on to it great story. While Ford' stock price hasn't done much over the last year, GM' is up almost 28%. But as I'll explain, at just 6.1 time 2016 earnings, GM' stock is still a veri good valu given the stori that' unfolding.GMdata byYChartsIn a lot of ways, GM' stori is like Ford's. GM is make big move to boost the profit of it core busi while invest in new technology-en busi that will help it thrive and profit instead of be ""disrupted"" as the industri transforms.But GM is arguabl farther along. GM beat everyone, even Tesla, to market with anafford 200-plus-mil electr car. It' gear up for ahug test of ""thousands"" of self-driv vehicleswith ride-hail start-up Lyft, of which GMown 9%. GM' car-shar business, Maven, is afast-grow high-tech rival to Zipcar-- and as with GM' partnership with Lyft, Maven is introduc lot of young urban folk to GM' best new models.Th electr Chevi Bolt is GM' platform for futur tech -- and the first of a whole line of electr GM vehicles.

CEO Mari Barra think GM can do better: Sever initi are under way to push that margin up into the 8% to 10% rang over the next few years.GM'sdividend is deliber conservative, to ensur that it' sustain through a downturn. But even so, and despit the run-up in GM' stock price over the last year, it' still yield about 4.1%. Rather than rais the dividend to level it might not be abl to sustain, GM is return cash to it owner with share buyback --$14 billion worthsinc earli 2015.Long stori short, here' what you get with GM today: profit growth, cutting-edg technology, a strong and steadi dividend, an ongo share-buyback program, and a valu price.10 stock we like even better than Ford and Gener MotorsWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Just Wait: Better Batteries Are Going to Turn the Energy Industry Upside Down,2/26/2017,"Sometim it' hard to see innov happen until one day, you wake up and realiz everyth ha changed. A decad ago, smartphon were the stuff of scienc fiction, cheap solar energi wa a pipe dream, and Elon Musk wa still struggl to keep hi electr car startup alive. Today, all three are huge growth stories.Th underli technolog that drove the innov product in smartphones, solar, and EV were present in 2007, but most peopl just didn't see how they could be practic adapt to revolution the world in such a short time.Today, improv in batteri technolog are on the cusp of chang everyth we know about energi in transport and electricity. The groundwork ha alreadi been laid, and a decad from now, we'll look back and think about how obviou the transform should have been ahead of time.makeArticleAd();Imag source: Getti Images.Batteri are the new solar panelsBefor we dive into how batteri will chang everything, I think it' import to frame what' go on today. The futur of grow batteri use and fall cost ha some preced in the energi industry. When I start write for The Motley Fool in 2010, the solar power industri wa small, andth cost to manufactur a solar panel wa about $1.10 per watt, mean buy a panel on the open market would cost you around $1.60 per watt. In 2017, solar panel price hit $0.40 per watt on the spot market, a quarter of their cost just seven year earlier, and a much faster cost reduct than anyon had predicted. It' no coincid that between 2010 and 2016 solar instal global nearli quintupl from 16 GW to74 GW.The same dynam is happen in the batteri market today, with massiv capac additions, cost reductions, and technolog improv happen at multipl compani simultan around the world.Tesla's(NASDAQ: TSLA) Gigafactori get a lot of attention, and Musk ha said a 35% reduct in batteri cost could be coming. Worth note that he claim hi cost were below $190 per kWh earli last year.Bi 2020, the forecast have batteri cost fall to below $100 per kWh, with manufacturersSamsung,Panasonic, andLG Chemlead the way. LG Chem is the supplier for the recent launch Chevi Bolt, which reportedli got batteri cell for just $145 per kWH.On top of these cost reductions, industri sourc say that energi densiti ha doubled, allow more energi to be pack into a smaller space. And as space constraint fall and cost come down, the potenti for batteri to disrupt the energi sector increases.Chang everyth we thought we knew about transportationWhen electr vehicl start to emerg on the scene, batteri cost alon wa a deterr to manufactur or buy them. When batteri were $400 per kWh a few year ago, that meant that by itself, the 65 kWh batteri that power a Tesla cost $26,000. But with $100 per kWh price on the horizon, a 100 kWh batteri would cost just $10,000 and provid a car over 300 mile in rang per charge, make EV a much more palat choice.It' no coincid thatGener Motors(NYSE: GM) ,BMW, Tesla, and mani other are acceler their EV develop now. Batteri themselv are no longer a hurdl for the industri to get over; soon, they will be a cost advantag over convent vehicles.I'm also becom more convinc that transport can be disrupt on a larger scale. Electr buse built by compani likeProterraar now cost competit with diesel power models,Mercedes-Benzi test urban e-trucks, and new compani likeNicola Onear launch electr semi-tractors.Th market growth of electr vehicl of all size is like a ball roll down a hill -- we just don't know how fast it' roll or where it' go to land. But with batteri price dropping, we can be assur that the disrupt in the transport industri is just beginning.Electr will never be the sameWhil batteri in vehicl will be a highli visibl application, power storag may be just as import to the energi industri overall. Batteri can store energi to make the grid more reliable, to offset the intermitt of renew energi sourc like wind and solar, and even justifi delay or cancel the construct of ""peaker plants"" that come onlin onli dure period of high demand.Th incred innov better, cheaper batteri allow is the abil to think of electr as more than a constant supply-and-demand equation. Sinc the grid wa built, gener had to match their product capac with peak demand, no matter what that demand was. Now, we can move excess suppli from one time of a day to another, and begin to start use energi more efficiently.Batteri can also be instal in homes, at businesses, or by grid operators. When a custom can react to price signal at a moment' notic or can cheapli and easili store the energi from their rooftop solar panel for use at night, it chang the electr busi forever.Batteri are go to chang everythingTh rapid cost reduct and improv technolog in the batteri industri are go to chang a lot of what we thought we knew about energy. And as these product get more cost effect they'll becom more common and soon they'll be commonplace.A decad from now, it won't be strang to drive an electr car, or take an electr bus, home from work, and flip on light that are power by solar or wind-gener electr store in your batteri system. The revolut is clearli happening, and investor should make sure they'r on the right side of the disrupt so they don't get run over.10 stock we like better than TeslaWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

In fact, afterOppenheim said on Feb. 14that investor should expect Tesla to take advantag of it recent high to issu new stock to rais fund for Model 3 production, TSLA stock went on a two-day 4% ralli to a new all-tim high.Th 10 Best Stock Chart on Wall Street Right NowWhich bring us to the real reason Tesla stock is down follow earnings: profit taking.What' Go on With Tesla?Click to EnlargeShar are up an impress 32% sinc the Novemb elections, with most of those gain come sinc the start of 2017. As a result, TSLA wa consider overbought, and trader are take thi opportun to use previous known issu to take profit off the table.If you'r in hold TSLA stock for the long-term, don't panic. Accord to Tesla' quarterli report, the Model 3 is still on track for full product in July, and deliveri are ramp up in fine style (rememb 47,000 and 50,000 vehicl in the first quarter compar to just 76,000 vehicl in all of 2016?)

As a result, the upper bound lie at about $269, while the lower bound rest near $234.With key support near $250, I would be extrem surpris to see TSLA stock trade near $235, and the upper bound of $269 rest well shi of the stock' recent all-tim highs, leav plenti of room for a rebound run higher.2 Trade for TSLA StockMarri Put:On way to buy Tesla at current level and ensur you have peac of mind in your portfolio is to enter what is call a ""marri put."" In thi strategy, trader buy to open one front-month at-the-money or out-of-the-money TSLA put for everi 100 share purchased.Th strike of the purchas put should reflect your risk tolerance. So, a March $250 put offer nearli full protect at current levels, with loss limit to about the cost of the put and brokerag fees. An out-of-the-money March $245 put would allow for TSLA to dip a bit further befor the ""insurance"" kick in.Buy Under Armour Inc (UAA) Stock While the World Hate ItAt last check, the TSLA March $250 put wa offer at $6.78, or $678 per contract, while the stock posit would total $roughli $252 at pre-open levels. If TSLA close below $250 when March option expire, you would be abl to exit the posit and avoid ani addit loss by exercis the put.Finally, if Tesla hold abov $200 through March expiration, you can roll the $250 put forward into April if you feel you still need the protection.Put Sell:You'l usual see me recommend put sell posit as a way to captur premium on a stock, but you can also use these option as a way to essenti name the price you want to pay for a stock. If you want to own TSLA stock, but want to wait for it to dip below $250, you could sell the March $250 put for $6.78, or $678 per contract, collect the premium, and wait for the share to pull back.If Tesla doesn't trade below $250, you still keep the premium and can roll your target out to the next contract month and tri again.

Yet, Alibaba stock is worth nearli $250 billion - almost 300 time the acquisit price.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockI wouldn't dismiss the deal as ""minor"" so quickly, however. While the purchas price isn't high, and the near-term impact on BABA stock is like minimal, Moneygram highlight the long-term strategi and potenti for Alibaba.Th bull case for Alibaba stock ha two major pillars: First, the compani can move beyond China to be a worldwid player and a legitim competitor toAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN). Second, like Amazon, Alibaba can move from it e-commerc root into all sort of profit efforts.Th Moneygram acquisit score well on both counts. Alibaba continu it push into the West. And, through the tie-up of Ant Financi and Moneygram, it continu it entri into the potenti lucr digit bank and payment servic markets.7 Ultra-Cheap Valu Stock to Buy NowStrategically, the deal lay the groundwork for further growth of BABA stock - and at a veri reason price. Investor shouldn't dismiss the deal simpli becaus the price doesn't seem high enough to matter.Alibaba Stock Need Intern GrowthAt the moment, Alibaba' busi still reli on Chines e-commerce. In the company' third quarter (end Dec. 31), China commerc gener 80% of revenue, with ~96% of that figur come from retail. Other businesses, includ cloud comput and entertainment, make up the other 20%. But, those busi remain unprofitable; Alibaba earn remain depend on Chines commerce. That' a bit of risk on it own, given concern about the Chines economy. Financi isn't consolid onto Alibaba' P&L, and at the moment, BABA ha a profit-shar agreement and could take up to one-third of Ant' equiti in an IPO. But, even that minor ownership mean Alibaba can use Ant Financi as an entranc into intern markets, and that' where Moneygram fit nicely.To begin, Ant can target Chines expatri in the U.S. and elsewhere. Ant alreadi ha joint ventur and partnership worldwide, and Moneygram further support it payment infrastructure. Plus, Alibaba' other offer such as e-commerce, entertain and even cloud services, can follow Ant' lead.At a valuat of nearli $250 billion, Alibaba stock probabl can't hold up on the Chines market alone, consid the sheer size of that market. There are too mani concern about the macro environ in that country. Internet and e-commerc penetr is increasing, but still low rel to develop countries.

But, Ant' effort in payment servic can move the needl for Alibaba stock, even given BABA' $250 billion valuation. Plus, Visa and Mastercard don't have the ad luxuri of use a payment servic platform to grow retail sales.Al told, I continu to believ that BABA stock is undervalued. I don't know that the Moneygram acquisit chang that dramat in the near term, but it highlight the potenti of the long-term strategi here. Own a Chines e-commerc retail might seem to have a lot risk at the moment, but Alibaba isn't just a Chines e-commerc retail anymor - and that' good news for BABA stock.A of thi writing, Vinc Martin did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlaceTesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Just Enter Danger TerritoryAppl Inc.

Nordstrom, though, is significantli outperform it mall peers. Retail gross profit rate increas more than 100 basi point in the quarter, versu 90 basi point at Macy' and 33 basi point and Kohl's. Thi is due to management' strong execution.Firstly, JWN is get a handl on inventories. Sale growth outpac inventori growth at Nordstrom by 500 basi point in Q4. Secondly, the compani is put an emphasi on privat label brands. Thi provid a shield against mall-wid promot activity. Go forward, gross margin should begin to experi some level of stabil and mayb even steadili expand.Oper expens growth also realli came down thi year. Becaus the transit to a multi-channel busi model requir signific investment, JWN' oper expens grew at 9% per year from 2010 to 2015. The invest paid off, and Nordstrom' e-commerc busi now repres a fourth of overal sale (versu 8% in 2010).More importantly, though, thi earli digit success ha been follow by less aggress spend.

Meanwhile, free cash flow wa $550 million, also significantli higher than the trail 5-year average.Ther are a coupl thing at play here.To adjust to lower sale growth, JWN manag is keep inventori down.

Thi would repres year-over-year growth of 61% to 71%, give Tesla some strong momentum as it begin product on the Model 3 in July.(Also Read:Tesla Post Strong Revenu Despit Q4 Loss, Global Net Order Up 49%)Tesla also post strong revenues, with fourth-quart sale figur of $2.28 billion comfort beat our consensu estim of $2.201 billion and grow 88.4% year-over-year.

The more optimist Tesla investor will also cling to Elon Musk' latest updat regard the product of the Model 3.A mention above, the Model 3 is slate to begin product in July, and the $35,000 car is expect to help move Tesla into a wider market that target the averag driver. Musk expect to make about half a million car in 2018, and hi expect are base on the idea that improv in manufactur will help hi compani reach that goal.""Th Model 3 is design for manufacturing,"" Musk said. ""It' a veri compel car, and we understand manufactur a lot better than we did in the past.""Of course, not everyth wa rainbow and butterfli for thi Zack Rank #4 (Sell) company. Besid it earn miss, investor are also punish Tesla for it increas capit expenditur relat to the Model 3.Musk did mention that the compani doe not actual need to rais more capit for the Model 3, but he did admit that thing were ""veri close to the edge"" and ""it probabl make sens to rais capit to reduc the risk.""Investor are obvious hesit about ani new spend from Tesla, which seem to be perpetu burn cash on it new projects. The compani also put some more uncertainti in the air with a separ announc about a big changeup in management.Accord to a companyblog post, Tesla CFO Jason Wheeler will be depart the compani in April.

Apple Inc. vs. Alphabet Inc: Value or Growth?,2/23/2017,"InvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsChoos between buyingAppl Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) andAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL) is the classic choic between valu and growth. And if you were confused, AAPL stock is the valu play, while GOOGL stock provid the growth.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockWhil Appl share have been on fire in 2017 - up 17% - you can still get in for a price-to-earn ratio around 16, lower than what investor are pay for the averageS&P 500stock. You also get a dividend of 57 cent per share, more than cover by earnings.GOOGL is the growth play. Revenu increas to $90 billion last year from $55 billion in 2013. Thi justifi a P/E of nearli 30. The share are also up 17% over the last 12 months.Right now, investor prefer valu over growth and Appl stock is do better than Alphabet. But thi isn't the proverbi choic between a rock and a hard place, instead, it' more like pick between cooki and ice cream. I own both stocks, I have own them for sever years, and I have profit handsom hold both.Th Case for AAPL StockNo technolog compani is as adept at squeez profit from hardwar as Apple.Whil other smartphon compani struggl to make money, Appl regularli bring $1 of everi $4 in iPhon sale to it bottom line. It close ecosystem is perceiv as safe and their product last for years.7 Ultra-Cheap Valu Stock to Buy NowTh current case for Appl stock, however, ha littl to do with hardware. Instead,servic now driveth stock forward. Servic like it app store - from which it take a 30% cut of sale - Appl Music, iPay and iCloud have becom huge, with $7.17 billion of revenu in the fourth quarter alone. The success of it servic enabl Appl to becom a power in the cloud by put more than$12 billioninto capit spend last year. It' no secret that the cloud is a capital-intens business, but Appl ha been abl to out-spend cloud rival without disturb it profit machine.AAPL hadov $246 billion in cashon it book at the end of last year, most of it kept overseas. The Trump administr ha propos a one-tim tax cut to encourag Appl to bring thi cash back to the U.S. That' enough money to buy compani such asComcast Corporation(NASDAQ:CMCSA) orWalt Disney Co(NYSE:DIS) outright.When analyst subtract the Appl cash from it market cap, they find the compani itself valu at ""just"" $460 billion, with a PE of 9 and just over two time sales. If you'r look for a cheap valu stock, pois for an era of unpreced growth, with plenti of safeti and margin for error, they say, buy AAPL today.Th Case for GOOGL StockTh artist formerli known as Googl have a differ case to make.Alphabet ha becom acash flow monster, deliv nearli $40 billion in oper cash flow last year. It revenu grew nearli 20%, and GOOGL' oper margin is over 25%.Cloud scale like no invent ever seen before, and Alphabet deliv a global search servic for liter nothing. It Android oper system is on87% of all smartphones, against just 12% for Apple, and Alphabet doesn't have to build or sell them. It just watch as custom who own them come to it services.But with no fanfare, GOOGL ha also becom a power in hardware. It Chromebook now outsel Apple' Macintosh line with about 5% of the PC market. Alphabet now particip in all the hardwar market pioneer by rival - from virtual realiti headset to stream devic - with watch and person assist that let you conduct search of your home or the world with just your voice.Und CFO Ruth Porat, who join the compani fromMorgan Stanley(NYSE:MS) in 2015, Alphabet is final tell investor how much they'r spend on ""other bets"" like robot and self-driv cars, and it' work to make money on those ventures.Th Bottom LineIt' hard to see a loser here.Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Is Feelings. Noth More Than Feelings.Th perceiv threat to Alphabet is the grow balkan of the Internet, with nation govern seek to control what peopl see and say within their borders, and who can profit from it. That ha yet to impact GOOGL, but even the percept can hurt a stock.AAPL is current benefit from a global flight to safety. It enorm cash position, it strength as a luxuri brand, and it growth in services, which could easili be expand into competit in the cloud with compani such as Alphabet, are all seen in the best light right now.If push to the wall and forc to buy just one right now, I would probabl go with GOOG, the non-vot version of Alphabet stock, which share equal in earn but sell at a $20 per share discount to the GOOGL shares.But both compani are likeGener Motor Company(NYSE:GM) wa in the 1950s,Intern Busi Machin Corp.(NYSE:IBM) wa in the 1960s, andHalliburton Company(NYSE:HAL) wa in the last decade.

Is SunPower Coming Up Roses in Residential Solar?,2/23/2017,"AmidSunPow Corporation's(NASDAQ: SPWR) struggl over the past year, includ the fourth quarter of 2016 in particular, the compani may final be show some promis in residenti solar, a busi long domin byTesla's(NASDAQ: TSLA) SolarCity,Vivint Solar(NYSE: VSLR) , andSunrun(NASDAQ: RUN) .Custom are now start to shun the long-term contract that come with leases, choos to pay cash or take out loan for their solar systems. And when they begin to make their own choic about solar equipment, SunPower' high efficiency, superior quality, and good aesthet have led to rise market share. Which of cours beg the question: Is thi a sustain win that SunPow can build off for year to come?Imag source: SunPower.makeArticleAd();Whi SunPow is differ in residenti solarSunPow ha a few key differenti from instal like Tesla, Vivint, and Sunrun. The first is that it sell through a dealer network rather than do sale and instal directly. That mean SunPow can sell a dealer panels, complet solut like Equinox, and leas financing, or ani combin of the three. It ha also built out loan partners, allow dealer to offer lease, loan, and cash sales, wherea nation competitor still have an incent to push custom to leases.Th second differenti is SunPower' high effici solar panels. The X-Seri solar panel now averag 25% effici on a cell level, mean panel are like 23%-23.5% efficient, exceed even high effici competitor by 300 basi point or more.Th Equinox solution, which includ micro invert and racking, is also a differentiator, make it more cost effect to instal X-Seri panels. And there' grow evid that SunPower' strategi is winning.Evid SunPow is winningTh past year ha been realli terribl for most residenti solar companies. Sale have been harder to come by and the market ha transit away from nation instal and leas to smaller instal and loan or cash sales. But that play into SunPower' hands, and the compani say it' now in the #2 posit in the residenti solar market.Th move to smaller installers, away from leases, and toward higher effici all play in SunPower' favor. And that should lead to grow sale and continu strong margins, which manag said were around 20% when you pull out one-tim restructur charges.What come nextTh interest dynam head into 2017 is that custom are move toward local and region installers, but batteri system are go to becom more common on the market. And the develop and smart control behind a batteri system will requir a larg compani to drive the econom benefit batteri can bring.Thi could put SunPow in an enviabl position, suppli product and technolog to local and region instal while still have the abil to control energi storag at a corpor level, creat virtual power plant or individu charg and discharg cycl depend on local rate structures. These are capabl Tesla and Sunrun are start to offer, but they come with their own instal infrastructur and don't give custom the same equip or financ choic as SunPower' dealer network.It' possibl that SunPow could be well posit in energi storag as well, although it hasn't releas a full strategi given the small size of the market. But if it does, residenti solar could go from a point of strength within the busi to a driver of valu for the compani long-term.What to watch forIf the strategi I laid out abov is a real winner for SunPower, we should see MW deploy in residenti solar rise, revenu from residenti solar grow, and margin remain over 20% and potenti trend higher over time.Given the fact thi is the one bright spot for earn right now, it' veri possibl manag will be abl to leverag residenti solar growth in the future.

Will Driverless Cars End Traditional Car Ownership?,2/23/2017,"I bought a use car recently, and a few day after I brought it home, a friend ask me, ""Do you think thi is the last car you'll ever buy?""W talk a lot about self-driv cars, so I knew exactli where he wa go with hi question. He wa hint at the fact that both autonom car technolog and ride-shar servic are advanc so quickli that by the time I'd be in the market for anoth vehicle, I might not actual need to buy one.Imag source: Getti Images.makeArticleAd();Bi 2035, the IH estim there will be 76 million car on the road worldwid with some level of autonomy.Even now, semi-autonom car that can keep themselv in their lanes, automat brake in emerg situations, and slow down to match the speed of the car in front of themcan be purchasedfor as littl as $20,000.And as genuin driverless car get cheaper and becom ubiquitous, you and I may opt out of monthli car payment and opt-in to a monthli mileag subscript servic instead.Automak are invest in thi futureTo understand how it' possibl that we could soon live in a world where most peopl don't own cars, we need to look no further than what the automak themselv are doing.Elon Musk' recent updat version ofTesla's(NASDAQ: TSLA) master plan includ detail on a new service: When the company' vehicl becom fulli autonom (bi 2018 or 2019, accord to Musk), Tesla owner will be abl to allow their vehicl to drive themselv around and be rent out by other people.A Musk wrote:Y will also be abl to add your car to the Tesla share fleet just by tap a button on the Tesla phone app and have it gener incom for you while you'r at work or on vacation, significantli offset and at time potenti exceed the monthli loan or leas cost.Imag source: Tesla.Musk also said that Tesla would deploy it own fleet of driverless vehicl for rent in area where there wa more demand for Tesla vehicl than privat own car could meet, so that ""you can alway hail a ride from us no matter where you are."" Remember, thi isn't the catchphras of a taxi company, nor even a ride-hail servic -- but rather the direct where Musk see hi automak headed.And just in case think thi mental is uniqu to the innov Tesla, consid whatGener Motors(NYSE: GM) is doing. The giant automak launch a ride-shar servic last year call Maven, which allow some GM owner to rent out their vehicl when they'r not in use. The car don't drive themselv yet, but the compani see it as a first step toward a futur where peopl are less inclin to own cars.In a press releas at the time, GM said that more than 25 million of it custom around the world will use some form of share mobil by 2020, and describ Maven as ""a key element of our strategi to chang ownership model in the automot industry."" Maven ha spread to 17 citi across North America in just 11 months, ha 22,000 members, and ha been use for 57 million mile of driving.Not to be outdone,Ford(NYSE: F) ha launch i ts own ride-shar service, and is develop autonom car just like GM. Ford ha made it clear that it intend to launch a ""high-volume"" driverless car pair with ride-hail and ride-shar servic by 2021. The compani is alreadi test 30 self-driv Fusion Hybrid in sever states, and plan to tripl the number of test vehicl thi year.Oth automak are move in thi direct as well.Fiat Chrysler(NYSE: FCAU) is work withAlphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Googl to test a fleet of 100 self-driv minivan that will be the basi for aride-hail serviceset to launch later thi year. It' still unclear what the servic will look like, or if Fiat Chrysler will play a critic role in it, but what is clear is that the automak believ in the viabil of Waymo' cars-as-a-servic goal.Wil thi realli end car ownership?It' hard to answer thi question conclusively, of course. After all, most peopl haven't even seen a fulli autonom vehicl on the road, let alon ridden in one.But John Zimmer, the co-found and presid of ride-hail compani Lyft,believ thatbi 2025 ""privat car ownership will all-but end in major U.S. cities."" Lyft expect the major of it vehicl to be self-driv by 2021, and rival Uber is test similar strategi as well.Oth have set similar timelin for the demis of car ownership. Georg Bauer, who ha held execut posit at Daimler, BMW, and TeslatoldBusi Insiderlast year that he think car ownership could be dead within five to 10 years.Govern regul and our own apprehens about give up control over our vehicl may preserv the widespread car ownership cultur for longer than some expect. But what' crystal clear is that tech compani and automak alik are bet on an automot futur that look veri differ than today. Like mani things, the transit from own car to rent driverless one on an as-need basi will like occur in stage -- but let' be clear, thing are certainli move in thi direction. And I, for one, would welcom a world without car payments.10 stock we like better than TeslaWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Onc there, it' typic five or 10 minut to ga up, pay and be back on the road.Electr car like those made by TSLA have the advantag of be abl to be charg at home, but that take a long time. Accord to Tesla' figures, half an hour on a home charger get about 27 mile of drive range. And that doesn't help when you'r traveling.Th compani ha been build up a Supercharg network that take on the role of ga stations. A Supercharg is capabl of ad 270 mile of drive rang in 30 minutes, and can fulli charg a Tesla Model S with 90 kWh batteri in roughli 75 minutes.Each Supercharg locat isestim to cost TSLA between $100k and $175kto build, take 12-20 week to complete.TSLA Will Doubl It North American Locat in 2017Tesla' Supercharg network ha two challenges.First, it is much, much thinner than the nation' network of ga stations. In all of the U.S. Canada and Mexico,Tesla current ha just 373 Supercharg locations, with 2,636 connections. Mani of those Supercharg locat are concentr on the east and west coasts.Then there is the charg time. While fill your car with enough ga to go 500 mile might take five or 10 minutes, fulli charg a base Model S take 75 minutes.With Tesla ownership limit to earli adopt with rel deep pockets, the spars Supercharg network ha mostli been an annoy - someth Tesla owner learn to work around. With the Model 3 slate to go into product in Septemb and kick off a wave of mass market Tesla ownership, those annoy risk becom a seriou problem.Earli adopt may be will to work around challenges, but averag consum quickli turn against a product that requir them to jump through hoops.In it full-year 2016 updat letter to investors,TSLA announc that is tackl the issue:""W plan to acceler expans of the Supercharg network thi year, start with doubl our number of North American Supercharg locat in 2017.""Expans and New Charg PoliciesDoubl the number of North American Supercharg locat help to address rang anxieti by fill in some of those area on the map that are current blank.

"Mobileye NV Q4 Earnings Are Good Enough for Now, But …",2/22/2017,"InvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsI'v long thoughtMobiley NV(NYSE:MBLY) is too expensive. Mobiley ha an interest opportun in driver assistance, and eventually, autonom driving. But it also ha intens competit from compani rang fromNvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA) toAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL) to Tier 1 supplier likeDelphi Automot PLC(NYSE:DLPH) andAutoliv Inc.(NYSE:ALV). But I haven't short MBLi stock - yet - and I hardli thought Mobileye' fourth-quart earn on Wednesday present an opportunity.makeArticleAd();Source:U.S. Embassi Tel Aviv via FlickrAft all, MBLi is a stori stock, and the stori look strong head into Mobiley earnings. A seri of deal and partnership announc in the past few week led MBLi stock up 35% from late Decemb lows. Optim around autonom drive and increas automot technolog continu to rise; there' a reasonTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) stock is near all-tim highs. Bet against that in the short-term seem foolish.That stori appear to hold for a littl while longer, as Mobiley earn out Wednesday morn came in ahead of consensu estim and the company' own guidance. In response, MBLi stock revers from modest gain to modest loss back to 2%-plu gain again in premarket trading. That seem to impli that investor alreadi are look forward.But it' there the Mobiley stori might have some holes.Mobiley Earn Look SolidMobiley earn for Q4 beat both Street consensu and it own guidanc on the top and bottom line. Revenu of $104.6 million, in particular, look impressive. MBLi had guid for roughli $96 million come out of Q3 in move expect to the high end of a full-year $344 million-$350 million range. Head into the earn report, analyst larg back those projections.7 Ultra-Cheap Valu Stock to Buy NowTh beat, then, impli growth roughli 11 point higher than thought, with revenu grow almost 46% year-over-year.Th driver (no pun intended) appear to be aftermarket sales. Those sale - larg dash-mount system on exist cars, rather than instal system in new car - increas 156% year-over-year. MBLi manag had rais full-year project for that divis after Q2 to 20% of total sales. In fact, Q4 Mobiley earn show the aftermarket drove 23% of full-year revenue, with sale increas 113% for full-year 2016.Earn per share beat consensu and impli guidanc by 2 cents, which impli that profit margin were roughli as expected. The reason like is that aftermarket sale offer lower gross margins, and thu aren't quit as profitable. MBLi ha improv gross margin in the business, but mix seem like the most signific reason whi the compani didn't better leverag sale growth.Long-Term Question Remain for MBLi StockTh fact that the revenu beat came from aftermarket growth isn't quit the outcom that Mobiley stock bull would have prefer for Q4.The excit busi here is in OEM, from both the standpoint of market opportun and profit margins. While 113% growth for aftermarket sale is noth to sneez at, it' still off a rather small base. And $82 million in aftermarket sale for 2016, on it own, isn't near enough to support a stock with an enterpris valu over $10 billion.That seem to mean investor are look forward. 2017 guidanc on the confer call is for EP of $1.01-$1.05 and revenu of $490 million-$505 million. Earn appear just shi of analyst estim of $1.04, while revenu of $490 million-$505 million suggest an outperform to Street expect of $491 million.That combination, however, mean margin will be a bit lower than forecast by analysts. That, in turn, like come from a higher-than-expect proport of aftermarket revenu - again, not what the bull necessarili want to hear.And that may be enough for some of the long-term concern to enter the narr in MBLi stock in post-earn trading.Look ForwardMorgan Stanley downgrad Mobiley stock at the begin of the month base on margin concern - a move that took MBLi stock down 3%. And the abil of Mobiley to maintain margin is a big concern of mine, longer-term.I'm still skeptic that ani semiconductor compani can hold price (and thu margins) longer-term. One of the few exceptions, of course, is Nvidia itself. But Mobiley stock, now trade at ~45x 2017 EPS, still is price higher than NVDA, and part of Nvidia' huge gain over the past year have come from optim over prospect for it Drive PX 2 platform.How to Trade Facebook Inc for 470% ReturnsThat platform is what Tesla turn to after it relationship end with Mobiley (and somewhat acrimoniously). That decis alon illustr the long-term challenges. Competit will be intense, and price will be too. It' import to rememb that MBLi is a semiconductor compani (though it ha softwar capabilities, admittedly) and an automot supplier. Neither industri tradit get veri high earn multiple, becaus both busi are extrem tough.For Mobiley to be an outlier on both fronts, it execut need to be perfect, and it growth flawless. Mobiley earn for Q4 show a step in the right direct from that standpoint.But with the earn beat driven larg by aftermarket sales, that step probabl isn't big enough for MBLi stock to take anoth step higher.A of thi writing, Vinc Martin did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlace7 Tech Stock That Could Implod at Ani Minute9 Top Pharmaceut Stock to Buy for the Dividends7 Dividend Stock for the Retir You DeserveTh postMobiley NV Q4 Earn Are Good Enough for Now, But …appear first onInvestorPlace."

While Model S wa launch in 2012, Tesla ha aggress been roll out major updat for the vehicle. Indeed, some of the most signific updat to Model S have found their way to the sedan veri recently.In August, Tesla launch a flagship P100D Model S with a zero-to-sixti time of 2.5 second when Ludicr mode is enabled. And the time drop to 2.4 second earlier thi year after a softwar update.In October, Tesla began includ sensor for autonom drive in everi vehicl (the autonom drive itself is slate to come later on via a softwar update).

Warren Buffett Might Make These 3 Driverless Car Investing Mistakes,2/22/2017,"Warren Buffett is well-known for having, among the core tenet of hi invest strategy, a prefer for compani with seriou ""competit moats"" -- attribut that give them the abil to sustain keep ahead of their competition. But base on hi rues, Buffett would never invest in an emerg industri like self-driv cars, and hi competit moat idea don't necessarili hold water in thi world. If you'r a fan of the Oracl of Omaha, bewar of follow hi invest philosophi into these three mistakes.1. Focus too much on sizeImag source: Alphabet (Waymo)makeArticleAd();Economi of scale are an import indic for almost ani company. As the logic goes, the bigger a compani is, the greater it abil to cut per-unit costs.Ford's(NYSE: F) abil to keep it car cost lower thanTesla Motors'(NASDAQ: TSLA) , for example, isn't just base on the fact that it produc more econom design vehicles. It' also due to the fact that Ford produc 1.5 million car in the third quarter of 2016, compar to the 24,800 car Tesla Motor deliv dure the same period.But scalabl in the driverless car industri doesn't necessarili have anyth to do with car sales. The automak with the best technolog may ultim come out ahead. Technolog is scalabl at almost no cost. When Tesla Motor wirelessli upload it latest softwar to it already-sold vehicl around the world, the compani pay nearli noth in per-unit costs. The race to build the best driverless car at thi stage ha much more to do with technolog than with number of vehicl sold, and the quantiti of car a compani ha sold thu far isn't a indic for which compani is best place to scale in the future.2. Exagger the valu of network effectsWhat network?Network effect are often tout as one of the strongest competit moat around.Facebook, an actual social network, perfectli defin the allur of the network effect. If everyon is use a specif product or platform, it can be extrem difficult for anoth compani to make inroads.At first glance, driverless car seem to be an excel opportun to build network effects. If one company' car all ""talk"" to each other as they navig the roads, they'll get to their destin faster and more safe than competitors' -- right? Wrong. Driverless car technolog must necessarili take into account public safety, and unique, exclusionari network fli in the face of a univers platform for safe self-driv cars. Automak engag in thi space alreadi know this; it' whi Ford, Tesla, and other are equip their driverless car with the best real-world object detect technolog available.When Ford announc earlier last week that it would invest $1 billion over five year in Argo AI, it wasn't becaus the startup ha thousand of self-driv car on the road -- it wa becaus the company' robot expertis ""give Ford a distinct competit advantag at the intersect of the automot and technolog industries,"" explain Ford Chief Technolog Offic Raj Nair in a press release. Likewise,Alphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) spinoff Waymo isn't reli on Google' treasur trove of data to guid it vehicl as they drive around. Instead, Waymo car are equip with sensor and softwar design to detect obstacl up to ""two footbal field away in all directions."" Ford, Alphabet, Tesla Motors, and other aren't interest in network effect in thi arena. They'r interest in their car have the most acut local-area awar they can contain.3. Expect govern regul to limit competitionRegular regulationRegul can provid some of the widest competit moat around. If onli one compani is abl to meet all the regulatori requir of be in a business, it' essenti illeg for other to tri to compet with it. The driverless car industri recogn this, and is make move to ensur a level play field for all involved.Alphabet, Ford, Lyft, Uber, and Volvo Car join togeth last April to creat the ""Self-Driv Coalit for Safer Streets, "" a lobbi group whose state mission is to ""work with lawmakers, regulators, and the public to realiz the safeti and societ benefit of self-driv vehicles."" These compani are interest in standard nation polici with simpl and low-cost barrier to entri for all interest automakers. So for Buffett fan look to back the compani with the strongest regulation-rel advantages, know that some of the biggest name in the busi are work proactiv to push polici that ensur no compani can ever build a regulatori moat.Pick the right self-driv car stockWarren Buffett is an incred investor, but he doesn't have answer for everi industry. There are mani open question around self-driv cars, and some compani are morepois to profitthan others. Rather than stick to one-size-fits-al invest mantras,equip yourself with the factsyou need to know, make inform investments, and set your portfolio to auto-pilot for year to come.10 stock we like better than Wal-MartWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Sinc earli December, the share have gain a sizzl 47%. By comparison, dure the same periodFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) is up about 13%,Netflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX) ha gain about 22% andAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) is up 14%.makeArticleAd();Source: Tesla MotorsBut go forward, it' probabl reason for investor to, well, get more cautiou on TSLA stock, which report earn Wednesday. Consid that yesterdayUB Group AG(USA)(NYSE:UBS) analyst Colin Langan publish a grim report on the company.On of hi big worri is the recent purchas of SolarCity, which ha been a persist money-loser. The compani may also face more pressur as the Donald Trump Administr take step to pull back support for the clean-energi industry.Accord toLangan: ""We continu to believ SolarC is an unneed distract dure a veri challeng launch period."" Actually, hi price target on TSLA stock is at $160.Oh, and Wall Street ha taken thi to heart. On news of the report, Tesla stock fell nearli 4%. In other words, the share appear to be particularli vulner to ani neg news.7 Tech Stock That Could Implod at Ani MinuteYet Langan is certainli not the onli Wall Street analyst who is bearish. Just look Cowen' Jeffrey Osborne. On Wednesday, he reaffirm hi lowli price target on TSLA stock at $155. Again, he is skeptic about the SolarC deal.Despit all this, Tesla CEO Elon Musk ha certainli found way to gin thing up. For example, he ha indic that the compani is plan to enter India and theUnit Arab Emirates. No doubt, these market have larg popul of wealthi peopl that would love to buy Tesla cars.

For example, in earli January, TSLA disclos that it had miss fourth-quart and full-year estim on deliveries.What' more, there may be some technic factor that could weigh on the company' shares.

3 Top Battery Stocks to Buy in 2017,2/21/2017,"Overh batteri spell disast forSamsunglast year, but batterystocks?They'r red hot in a good way-- and ripe for the pick as we enter into 2017.From miner of lithium to manufactur of lithium ion, nickel-met hydride, and other sort of batteries, investor today have a good hand of public batteri compani to choos from. For my money, though, the best ""batteri stocks"" to watch are the one target the market for electr cars:Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) ,Panasonic(NASDAQOTH: PCRFY) , andGener Motors(NYSE: GM) .(And no, that' not a typo. As I'll explain, Gener Motor reallyisa forc to be reckon with in electr car batteries.)makeArticleAd();Batteri are evolv -- and more import than ever. Imag source: Getti Images.TeslaWhi cars? Partli becaus of scale. Tesla' 60 kWh batteri pack, for example, is power by 14 batteri modules, contain 384 batteri cell each. That' a total of at least 5,376 cell that go into each Tesla Model S sold. Larger batteri pack will logic contain even more modul and cells. Multipli that by the 500,000 electr car Tesla plan to be sell annual by 2020, that' ... a lot of batteries. And that' befor count the number of batteri (admittedly, of differ types) that go into power electr car from Gener Motors, fromFord, fromToyota,Nissan, and all the others.In addition, you'v probabl heard by now thatTesla ha chang it name, drop the ""Motors"" monik from ""Tesla Motors."" Part of the reason for thi chang is that Tesla is make energi storag for home and busi a bigger part ofitsbusiness, with it new Powerwal product. In do so, Tesla isn't just open a new market for batteries, and creat a place for solar power, gener by it solar-panel business, to be store when not need -- it' also give itself room to scale up it business, so that it will be abl to make full use of the batteri Gigafactori it' build in the Nevada desert.PanasonicIncidentally, thi offer us a nice segu into discuss Tesla' partner in the Gigafactori project -- our second batteri stock to watch, which is Panasonic.Th Japanes electron giant is assist Tesla with batteri product in Nevada, and hope to benefit from both the scale of batteri product there, and from the assur custom for it batteri that Tesla will becom (and indeed, alreadi is). Alreadi the world' top batteri manufactur by a factor of 3, Panasonic' batteri domin promis to grow even further through it partnership with Tesla.I'd also be remiss in not point out that, wherea Tesla may be the biggest stori stock in batteri investing, it' not current profit -- but it supplier Panason is. Accord to data fromS&P Global Market Intelligence, Panason earn $1.9 billion in profit over the past year. And Panasonic' ""automot and industri systems"" division, which hous it batteri business, contribut more profit ($914 million) than ani of the company' other three big divisions. With a stock now trade for less than 14 time trail earnings, Panason is arguabl one of the best bargain in batteri stock today.Gener MotorsBut it' still not as cheap as Gener Motors. I know, I know -- you say Gener Motor make cars, not batteries. But take a look at whatkindof car Gener Motor ha been make lately: The Chevi Volt, namedMotor Trend' Car of the Year in 2011. The Chevi Bolt, name Car of the Yearthisyear. In both instances, Gener Motor won accolad for roll out electr cars.Whil Gener Motor doesn't make the batterycellsthat go into power these car (South Korea' LG Chem doe that for the company), GM doe assembl those cell into the batterypacks. What' more, GM' involv in batteri technolog may be deeper than you know.InTh Powerhouse: Insid the Invent of a Batteri to Save the World, formerWal Street Journalcorrespond Steve Levin describ the histori of America' Argonn Nation Laboratori and it effort to build a better recharg batteri -- specifically, one capabl of power a car for 200 mile of drive on a singl charge. Central to the book' stori is Gener Motors' work with batteri behemoth such as LG Chem, and also with ground-break start-up such as privat held Envia -- includ through make equiti invest in the latter.Simpli put, GM is work -- both through it in-hous batteri lab and through partnership elsewher in the batteri industri -- to develop an entir new ""superbattery"" that it call NMC 2.0. Unlik the bank of generic, cheap, but older-tech nickel-cobalt-aluminum 18650 that power Tesla' sedans, GM ha been develop a nickel-manganese-cobalt cell that it believ will offer greater energi density, give Chevy' Bolt (and futur electr cars) a rang advantag over Tesla.At last report, Gener Motor still hadn't solv the mysteri of invent NMC 2.0.

A big util name put it financi muscl behind residenti solar, which will give the product valid and the company' oper stability. Onli that' not what the industri needed.Instead of custom flock to a util tri to distrupt itself, they stuck with compani tri to disrupt the world. SolarCity,Vivint Solar,Sunrun, andSunPowerremain more attract option for custom than NRG Home. And in the past 18 months, the market ha been shift away from larg nation instal to local and region instal that have lower cost and can be more nimbl in the market.We'v seen someth similar with NRG' EV charg network. It' a good solut from the wrong player in the market. So, instead of NRG' flexibl charg network be a marvel of the EV community,Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) is the charg network that' becom the standard everyon els ha to live up to.Th clash of the old world and the newIt isn't that NRG' manag got their vision of the futur wrong. It' that NRG wasn't necessarili the compani to execut on that vision. It custom were confus by the transit to solar, and in mani state NRG Home wa tri to enter, they had no prior knowledg of NRG. And investor in a util like NRG were look for cash flow, not billion of dollar of invest in a busi that may take year to show real sign of progress.With the activist investor involved, NRG Energi is like to split into a green busi and a fossil fuel business. The green busi ha alreadi been separ and is either shut down or be sold. NRG Home is be wound down and a major stake in EVgo ha been sold. It' possibl theNRG Yield(NYSE: NYLD) stake will be sold as well in an effort to monet asset and return the cash to shareholders.Wheth there' a spinoff or just a sale of assets, it look like the old energi world is beat the new at NRG Energy.A transit gone wrongIt' harder than it seem for fossil fuel compani orutil to make a transitionto new, cleaner form of energy. The invest structur and incent for the two are just too differ to coexist. Fossil fuel and util are all about cash flow and find way to make money off the statu quo.Renew energy, particularli energi product on rooftops, is about break the energi statu quo and replac it with more individu independence. And break the tradit energi busi doesn't alway come with predict cash flow or instal each quarter.Th two strategi are simpli at odd with each other, and NRG Energi abandon most of it renew busi is a casualti of the realiti of the energi industri today. Old and new form of energi just don't mix under one roof and NRG Energi found that out the hard way.10 stock we like better than NRG EnergyWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: Tesla, Volatility Index and Gilead",2/21/2017,"For Immedi ReleaseChicago, IL - Februari 21, 2017 - Today, Zack Invest Idea featur highlight Features:Tesla(NASDAQ:TSLA-Fre Report),Volatil Index(NYSEARCA:VXX-Fre Report)andGilead(NASDAQ:GILD-Fre Report).5 Major Myth About Option TradingWhen it come to investing, pretti much everyon ha an opinion. While those opinion are great, sometim investor will spread myth about subject they don't have a firm understand of. One of the most confus subject isopt trading. Due to the mani move part involved, investor find themselv befuddl and not know where to start. Here I'm go to debunk five major myth of option trading.Myth #1: Option are Riskier than StocksThi is one of those broad-based, blanket statement that doe not tell the whole truth. Peopl think option are riskier becaus you can lose 100% of your invest in an option. However, you can use option to limit your risk on trades.Here' an example, let' say you want to buy 100 share ofTesla(NASDAQ:TSLA-Fre Report)ahead of their earn report next week becaus you think they are go to have a good report and the stock will go up. Today it would cost you around $270 per share or $27,000 to own 100 shares. If TSLA goe down 10% on it earn report, you are go to lose $2,700 dollars. If it goe up 10%, you'll make $2,700.On the flipside, you could buy the March 17th$270 Call option for $1,350. If TSLA goe down 10% and stay there through expiration, you'll lose your $1,350. If it goe up 10%, you'r call option will be worth at least $2,700, mayb more. If you want to defin your risk as $2,700, you could buy two of these contracts, control 200 share of Tesla rather than onli 100. Same amount of nomin risk, but now your upsid potenti is doubled.Myth #2: You Need to be a Sophist Trader for OptionsTher certainli are option strategi that involv a great deal of complexity. With so mani choic avail to trade it can be veri complicated. Each option expir date ha call option and put option of vari strike available. At first glanc the select process can be daunting. Mani stock now have weekli option expiration, make these even more overwhelm for investors.Y don't need a PhD in Appli Mathemat to use simpl option strategi to make money and creat income. For example, buy a call in the hope that a stock goe up. If you know there is an event come up that you think the stock will profit from, you can buy a call near the money on the stock and if it goe up you can profit. If you want to make a trade that benefit when the stock goe down, you can buy a put option in the hope the stock goe down. Start with the basic and add more complex strategi as you becom more comfortable.Myth #3: It Take a Lot of Money to Trade OptionsThi couldn't be further from the truth. It' a lot less capit intens to trade option than it is to buy 100 share of your favorit stock. Most brokerag firm allow you to sell option premium, a more advanc strategy, in account that contain as littl as $2,000. Compar that to Pattern Day Trader account which requir at least $25,000.Trade option allow smaller account to gain exposur to more stock for less money. You can diversifi your option trade across mani industri and mani stock simultaneously. There are even option on ETF like theVolatil Index(NYSEARCA:VXX-Fre Report)so you can gain exposur to exot financi instrument while manag your risk.Myth #4: Time is Alway Work Against YouIf you are long or buy option then yes, there is a time valu element that' work against you. However, there are simpl way to flip the script so thi time work in your favor. One way is by use long call and long put spread rather than buy a call or put outright. The other is to use credit spreads.A long call spread, or a bull call spread, is a two-leg option trade where a closer to the money option is purchas to open and a further out of the money call option is sold to open or shorted. Thi help to drop the overal net debit or price of the call spread. It also limit the total profit potenti of the trade.For example, if I bought a March 17th$67.50 Call onGilead(NASDAQ:GILD-Fre Report)today it would cost me about $2.95. My upsid potenti would be unlimit but my breakeven would be the strike price plu the net debit which in thi case is $2.95, make my breakeven $70.45.However, if I believ Gilead' upsid is limit to $72.50, I could sell that $72.50 Call at the same expir and take back some money, drop my overal cost on the spread, therefor bring down my breakeven. I could sell the $72.50 Call for 55c. Now my cost on the $67.50/72.50 Call spread is onli $2.40, my breakeven now $69.90, and I'll make more money up to $72.50 than I would have with the long call by itself.Anoth exampl is the credit spread. Rather than buy the aforement spread, if I'm bearish on GILD I can sell the spread. So instead of spend $2.40 for the spread I would pocket $2.40. My risk would be the $5 differ in the strike prices, minu the $2.40 I took in premium. So I risk $2.60 to make $2.40. Thi credit spread would max out or give me the largest possibl win outcom of $2.40 if share of GILD close at or below $62.50 at expir on March 17th.Myth #5: You Need a Special Account to Trade OptionsWell, sort of. While you do need to sign an option risk acknowledg form and get your account approv specif for option trading, it' not exactli a ""special account."" Pretti much ani non-qualified, or non-retirement, account is elig for option trading. I specifi non-qualifi becaus account like IRA are restrict as to the type of option trade you can do sinc you can't short stock in retir accounts.Ther are sever level of option approv out there, design to save investor from themselves. Each level or tier is restricted, onli allow certain type of trading. Each broker ha their own guidelin for what these level look like. All you realli need for approv is experi trade and capital. It' not like you have to be a millionair or anything.Bottom LineThos are the five biggest myth about option trade that scare off potenti traders. If you take the time to learn more about trade options, you'll find that they are a great way to manag your risk and gain exposur to the stock market.FollowBrian Bolanon Twitter@BBolan1W more articl from thi author?

Are General Motors and Lyft About to Crush All Self-Driving Rivals?,2/19/2017,"Gener Motors(NYSE: GM) is plan to build and deploy thousand of self-driv electr car in test fleet with Lyft next year, accord to a newReutersreport.If that' for real, it will be by far the largest fleet of autonom test vehicl in operation. It' a veri big deal that ha huge implic for GM, Lyft, and their rivals.What the report saidAccord to the Reuter article, GM will build thousand of Chevi Bolt equip with prototyp version of the self-driv system GM ha develop with it subsidiary, Cruis Automation. Most of these self-driv Bolt will go into ride-hail servic with Lyft in sever state start sometim in 2018.makeArticleAd();GM ha no plan right now to sell the self-driv Bolt to the gener public.CEO Mari Barra announc in Decemb that GM would begin produc self-driv Chevrolet Bolt test vehicl in earli 2017. Imag source: Gener Motors.What it would mean for GMGM ha been work on self-driv technolog for years. That work seem to take a big leap forward with the acquisit of San Francisco-bas start-up Cruis Autom earli last year. It appear that Cruis ha sinc becom the center of GM' research efforts. Cruise' self-driv Chevi Bolt test car have becom regular sight on San Francisco streets, and recent video taken from insid self-driv Bolt test car suggest thatth GM/Cruis technolog is at a fairli advanc level. GM announc in Decemb that it would soon begin produc self-driv Bolt test vehicles, but the hint wa that -- at least in the near term -- they'd be produc in small quantiti for GM' own testing.A mass deploy would demonstr two things: First, that GM' technolog realli is at a high level, and second, that GM and it supplier partner are readi and abl to mass-produc self-driv cars.Both of those thing are significant. Taken together, it would be a strong argument that GM is lead the way to mass-produc Level 4 self-driv vehicles. Compani likeAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) andTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) have attract a lot of investor attent for (among other things) their self-driv efforts, but -- as of right now, at least -- GM seem pois to leapfrog just about everybody.What it would mean for LyftLyft, like it larger rival Uber Technologies, know that replac it human driver with self-driv vehicl is crucial to it future. Autonom ride-hail vehicl will allow Lyft to lower it price while gener (hopefully) strong profits.Ub ha been work on it own self-driv technolog for a coupl of years, and ha a fewprototyp self-driv test car in servicenow. Lyft isn't known to have done ani work on a self-driv system of it own, but it doesn't need to: GMown a 9% stakein Lyft, and GM seem to have it handled.If Lyft beat Uber to a self-driv fleet at scale, Uber will have a big challeng on it hands.GM presid Dan Ammann (center) with Lyft co-found Logan Green (left) and John Zimmer. GM own 9% of the ride-hail company, and Ammann is a member of it board of directors. Imag source: Gener Motors.Could thi be for real?Th Reuter report, by veteran auto-busi journalist Paul Lienert, cite two unnam ""sourc familiar with the automaker' plans."" Generally, investor (and everyon else) should take report base on inform from unnam sourc with a grain or two of salt. But a few thing suggest to me that thi is probabl for real.First, Lienert is a veteran with good sources, and Reuter hold it report to high standards. Second, the report fit with the known facts: GM and Lyft have both said that atest of autonom GM vehicl in Lyft servic is forthcoming. Third, GM' Orion, Michigan, factory, where the Bolt is built, ha plenti of capac to do a special product run in the thousands.Finally, and most tellingly, neither Lyft nor GM deni the report. In fact, GM' statement in respons wa almost a smile hint:W do not provid specif detail on potenti futur product or technolog rollout plans. We have said that our AV technolog will appear in an on-demand ride share network applicationsoon than you might think. [Emphasi added.]Translation: Thi is like to happen, and it might begin sooner than 2018.How import is thi for GM investors?If it happens, it will be a big deal. While the idea of a ""race"" to self-driv technologyisn't realli use to investors, a big test like thi next year (or sooner) will show that GM isn't about to be disrupt by Silicon Valley when it come to self-driving. It will also give lot of peopl an opportun to experi self-driv technolog firsthand, which will almost certainli speed it adopt by increas consum demand.If noth else, it seem veri like to attract investors' attent and give GM share a boost.10 stock we like better than Gener MotorsWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"Solar Energy Production Hit a Record High in 2016, So What's Wrong With Solar Stocks?",2/18/2017,"2016 wa an amaz year for the solar industri overall, even if it wasn't great for solar stocks. GTM Research recent report that it upcom U.S. Solar Market Insight Report done with the Solar Energi Industri Associ will reveal a 95% jump in instal last year to 14.6 GW.To put that number into perspective, that' enough solar to power 2.4 million home in the U.S. On top of the huge instal numbers, solar account for 39% of all new electr instal in 2016, a record for the industry. And with cost come down everi year, the futur look bright for the industry.Imag source: Getti Images.makeArticleAd();Th solar industry' great yearTh chart below show the solar industry' incred growth over the past six years. Everi segment of the market ha grown, led by the utility-scal solar market.Data source: GTM Research / SEIAU.S. Solar Market Insight Report.Thi surg versu 2015 wa driven by fall cost for solar instal and contract sign to be complet in 2016 befor the solar invest tax credit (ITC) wa extended. It realli wa the ITC that led to a massiv boom in solar last year, but it' also the reason solar stock had a terribl 2016.What went wrong with solar stocksAcross the board, solar stock had a rough year in 2016, despit the instal boom.SunPower(NASDAQ: SPWR) ,First Solar(NASDAQ: FSLR) ,Vivint Solar(NYSE: VSLR) , andSunrun(NASDAQ: RUN) are all down significantli sinc the start of 2016. And SolarC would be in the same boat if it weren't for it buyout byTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) .SPWRdata byYCharts.Th reason stock are down is becaus the ITC extens meant there were veri few new contract sign in 2016. The activ that led to last year' boom in instal wa a result of contract sign in 2014 and 2015, befor the ITC extens wa signed. So, what investor were concern about wa the lack of new contract in the market.Even the residenti market went through someth of a slowdown. Final number aren't out yet, but growth is like in the singl or low doubl digits, driven by the lack of urgenc to instal solar. Residenti project have a much shorter lead time than util projects, so the ITC extens hit the market as earli as the first quarter of 2016, wherea the impact of the ITC won't be a drag on util instal until 2017.What solar investor can expect in the futureWe'v known for a few quarter now that 2017 will be bad for the solar industry. Utility-scal project will be hard to come by domest and even project sign thi year won't like begin construct until 2018 or beyond. And the 14.6 GW of solar instal in 2016 will like be the industry' peak until at least 2018.But the good news is that solar energi is cheaper than ever and it' now compet with fossil fuel on a cost basis. Long term, that will lead to a tremend amount of growth, and compani like First Solar, SunPower, Vivint, Sunrun, and Tesla should lead the way.

Why Wind and Solar May Have to Fill In for America's Crumbling Hydro Infrastructure,2/18/2017,"When politician talk about ""crumbl infrastructure,"" it' often hard to ascertain exactli what they'r talk about. Is itbridg fall down, an excess number of potholes, or mayb age airports? It could mean ani number of thing depend on who' talk and who' listening.Thi week, an age piec of infrastructur is acut impact nearli 200,000 peopl in California as the Orovil Dam' damag spillway teeter close to collapse, potenti flood a larg swath of northern California. The dam itself doesn't (yet) appear to be damaged, but it' not function as planned. And the problem aren't new given the fact that environment group were push for addit spillway construct 12 year ago at the now 49-year-old dam. Incidentally, dam are onli design with a 50-year life span, so it' worth keep in mind that infrastructur isn't built to last forever.Ani kind of infrastructur goe through normal wear and tear over time, but the challeng today is the sheer age of dam infrastructur in the U.S. Accord to a 2015 Depart of Energi report, 75% of hydro capac is at plant that are over 50 year old (although some have been upgrad sinc first construction). The Orovil Dam' potenti spillway collaps could bring that age into focus, which could impact other sourc of renew energi as well.makeArticleAd();Imag source: Getti Images.Crumbl dam infrastructureTh chart below is from the Depart of Energy' 2014 Hydropow Market Report, which wa releas in April 2015. It show that a vast major of U.S. hydro plant were built between 1940 and 1970, particularli larg plants.Imag source: Depart of Energi 2014 Hydropow Market Report.If these plant begin to be review more close or are decommissioned, it could take dozen of gigawatt of energi product offlin over the next decade. And given their age, it may be a good idea to do just that.Th crumbl hydro infrastructur may also be a new opportun for wind and solar energi in the U.S.. When you consid that hydro power gener 249 million MWh of electr in 2015, the opportun is enormous.Energi and the RP standard conundrumHydro power is the biggest sourc of renew energi in the U.S., onli recent surpass by all other renew energi sourc (exclud nuclear) combined. So, it' a big piec of the energi industry.Imag source: U.S. EIA.But it' also the biggest singl part of state-level renew portfolio standard (RPS). In state like California, thi is the polici that ha driven the growth in wind and solar over the past decade. If you pull ani hydro plant out of the mix, anoth energi sourc ha to fill that gap. And it will have to be clean energy, so wind and solar fit the bill.A growth opportun for solar energyLet' take the Orovil Dam as an exampl of the challeng and opportun for utilities, grid operators, and renew energy. If the 819 MW dam were to be taken offline, it would take about 3.5 GW of solar (which onli produc energi about a quarter of the time) to fill the gap. That compar to 14.6 GW be instal in all of 2016, accord to GTM Research, so larg dam are incred import to the country' electr infrastructur overall.But it wouldn't be crazi to think that over the cours of the next decad or two some of these hydro plant will be decommiss as they age. And to replac all hydro, about 114 GW of solar or wind would need to be instal to replac clean energi with clean energy. RPSs would demand that wind and solar would fill the gap, not fossil fuels.That' an incred potenti opportun for develop likeFirst Solar(NASDAQ: FSLR) ,SunPower(NASDAQ: SPWR) , andTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) , whether they'r build solar plant or energi storag to provid more predict power output.Th crumbl infrastructur opportunityWhat' go on at the Orovil Dam ha an impact on years' worth of energi planning, especi if the spillway collapses. In California' RP structure, a larg hydroelectr dam couldn't be taken offlin without eventu be replac by renew energi sourc like wind and solar. And when you consid the sheer age of the hydro infrastructur in the U.S., it could creat a huge hole other sourc of renew energi would need to fill.10 stock we like better than Wal-MartWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Tesla Model 3: How Many Will Be Delivered In 2017?,2/17/2017,"Go into electric-car makerTesla's(NASDAQ: TSLA) fourth-quart earn release, here' the biggest question: How mani Model 3 vehicl will manag say it expect to deliv dure the year? After all, we alreadi know Tesla ha about 400,000 deposit-back reserv for the $35,000 vehicles. But the big mysteri is how Tesla' Model 3 product ramp-up will look -- and thu Model 3 deliveries.Whil investor may not get a veri specif answer, management' guidanc rang for total vehicl sale will like provid some use insight into Tesla' outlook for the highli anticipated, lower-cost vehicle.Model 3. Imag source: Tesla Motors.makeArticleAd();Look to guidanceIf Tesla follow it usual practice, it will provid an outlook for expect full-year vehicl deliveri when it report itsfourth-quart resultson Feb. 22, but it won't break down thi forecast by model. Still, investor can extrapol from guidanc for total deliveri to get an idea of what manag might expect from Model 3.Tesla CEO Elon Musk ha long predict it expect it late-2015 launch Model X to eventu rival Model S deliveries, bring total Model S and Model X annual deliveri to about 100,000 units. With thi context, ani guidanc beyond 100,000 unit in 2017 could presum repres expect Model 3 deliveries.So, what sort of guidanc rang should investor expect from Tesla management? While thi may not be the answer investor are hope for, manag will like guid for a wide rang of possibl outcomes. There' simpli signific uncertainti associ with forecast a huge step chang in vehicl manufacturing.Musk explain the difficulti of forecast Model 3 deliveri in the company' fourth-quart earn call:Anoth thing I realli want to emphas is the product ramp tend to look like -- is exponential. Ultim it is an S-curve. An exponenti goe to linear then goe to log. And it' veri difficult to predict exactli where that begin part of the exponenti and the S-curv fit in between quarterli reporting.A shift of even a few week one way or the other can have quit a dramat effect on what it look like in that quarter, but that' not indic of the future. So we'r tell you what we -- we'r give you the best assess we have short of have a crystal ball.But Musk did provid some vision -- albeit veri vagu -- into Tesla' expect for Model 3, say he think it will be an ""excit 2017."" Further, he said that Model 3 product will be veri uncertain in Q3 but ""get pretti clear in Q4.""Whi Tesla' guidanc mattersShould investor even take Tesla' guidanc seriously? I think so.It' worth note that, despit Tesla' well-docu tendenc to miss targets, it recent miss are rel small in relat to it rapidli grow targets. Even more, the percentag gap between Tesla' initi annual guidanc in recent year and it actual deliveri isn't growing, despit extrem growth in it targets.YearIniti GuidanceActu Vehicl DeliveriesDifference201320,00022,44212.2%201435,00031,655(9.6%)201555,00050,658(7.9%)201680,000-90,000*76,230(10.3%*)Total195,000180,985(7.2%)Asterisk indic figur is calcul use a midpoint of a guidanc range. Tabl by author.Sure, there will like be more uncertainti associ with Tesla' guidanc for 2017 deliveri than in previou year given the guesswork even manag will need to employ to predict Model 3 deliveries. But Tesla' histori of small miss on big growth target give investor good reason to at least expect it guidanc to reflect a likelytrajectoryfor actual vehicl deliveri in 2017.Wait! What about those Model X delays?When forecast Tesla' Model 3 product ramp-up in 2017 and beyond, it' probabl tempt for investor to look to Tesla' Model X delay and product challeng as a forewarn for Model 3 product troubles. But there are sever issu with thi reasoning.First, unlik the Model X, the Model 3 wa design from the ground up for high-volum production. Second, the Model X is an insan complex vehicle, featur never-before-manufactur featur like falcon wing doors, self-pres front doors, the largest front windshield in ani vehicle, and monopost seats.Further, the Model X is the first fully-electr SUV ever built. Indeed, it' arguabl a borderlin miracl that Tesla wa even abl to achiev an annual product run rate of 40,000 Model X unit by the end of 2016.Model X. Imag source: Author.In Tesla' third-quart earn call last year, Musk specif warn investor not to look to Model X as an exampl of how Model 3 product could turn out:It' alway tempt for peopl to reason by analog instead of first principles. And that would be the mistak of assum that anyth to do with the X product ha bear on the Model 3.They are veri differ program with complet differ approaches. So I would not tri to extrapol from that, ani more than it would'v made sens to extrapol from the Roadster when we were make 600 car a year, to 20,000 car a year with the Model S....If you were to extrapol from the Roadster experience, you would be complet wrong about the Model S outcome, and mani peopl were. That' whi I would say X is not relevant.Interestingly, for the first full calendar year of Model S deliveries, Tesla actual exceed it initi guidanc for 20,000 vehicles, deliv 22,500 units. While achiev the same sort of surpris outcom at Tesla' higher-volum product today won't be easy, manag is clearli confid in a veri steep product ramp-up for Model 3.Tesla vehicl production. Imag source: Author.Anoth year of 50% growth?I'l be expect Tesla to provid a guidanc rang of approxim 110,000 to 130,000 units, repres about 50% year-over-year growth in deliveri and around 10,000 to 30,000 Model 3 deliveries. However, sinc Tesla is expect it annual product to increas from a run rate of 100,000 unit today to an incred 500,000 unit in 2018, onli 110,000 to 130,000 deliveri in 2017 would mean Tesla' first and second quarter of 2018 will need to be character by the steep portion of the S-curve.But thi is how S-curv look.

Five Major Myths about Options Trading,2/17/2017,"makeZacksArticleAd();When it come to investing, pretti much everyon ha an opinion. While those opinion are great, sometim investor will spread myth about subject they don't have a firm understand of. One of the most confus subject isopt trading. Due to the mani move part involved, investor find themselv befuddl and not know where to start. Here I'm go to debunk five major myth of option trading.Myth #1: Option are Riskier than StocksThi is one of those broad-based, blanket statement that doe not tell the whole truth. Peopl think option are riskier becaus you can lose 100% of your invest in an option. However, you can use option to limit your risk on trades.Here' an example, let' say you want to buy 100 share ofTesla (TSLA)ahead of their earn report next week becaus you think they are go to have a good report and the stock will go up. Today it would cost you around $270 per share or $27,000 to own 100 shares. If TSLA goe down 10% on it earn report, you are go to lose $2,700 dollars. If it goe up 10%, you'll make $2,700.On the flipside, you could buy the March 17th$270 Call option for $1,350. If TSLA goe down 10% and stay there through expiration, you'll lose your $1,350. If it goe up 10%, you'r call option will be worth at least $2,700, mayb more. If you want to defin your risk as $2,700, you could buy two of these contracts, control 200 share of Tesla rather than onli 100. Same amount of nomin risk, but now your upsid potenti is doubled.Myth #2: You Need to be a Sophist Trader for OptionsTher certainli are option strategi that involv a great deal of complexity. With so mani choic avail to trade it can be veri complicated. Each option expir date ha call option and put option of vari strike available. At first glanc the select process can be daunting. Mani stock now have weekli option expiration, make these even more overwhelm for investors.Y don't need a PhD in Appli Mathemat to use simpl option strategi to make money and creat income. For example, buy a call in the hope that a stock goe up. If you know there is an event come up that you think the stock will profit from, you can buy a call near the money on the stock and if it goe up you can profit. If you want to make a trade that benefit when the stock goe down, you can buy a put option in the hope the stock goe down. Start with the basic and add more complex strategi as you becom more comfortable.Myth #3: It Take a Lot of Money to Trade OptionsThi couldn't be further from the truth. It' a lot less capit intens to trade option than it is to buy 100 share of your favorit stock. Most brokerag firm allow you to sell option premium, a more advanc strategy, in account that contain as littl as $2,000. Compar that to Pattern Day Trader account which requir at least $25,000.Trade option allow smaller account to gain exposur to more stock for less money. You can diversifi your option trade across mani industri and mani stock simultaneously. There are even option on ETF like theVolatil Index (VXX)so you can gain exposur to exot financi instrument while manag your risk.Myth #4: Time is Alway Work Against YouIf you are long or buy option then yes, there is a time valu element that' work against you. However, there are simpl way to flip the script so thi time work in your favor. One way is by use long call and long put spread rather than buy a call or put outright. The other is to use credit spreads.A long call spread, or a bull call spread, is a two-leg option trade where a closer to the money option is purchas to open and a further out of the money call option is sold to open or shorted. Thi help to drop the overal net debit or price of the call spread. It also limit the total profit potenti of the trade.For example, if I bought a March 17th$67.50 Call onGilead (GILD)today it would cost me about $2.95. My upsid potenti would be unlimit but my breakeven would be the strike price plu the net debit which in thi case is $2.95, make my breakeven $70.45.However, if I believ Gilead' upsid is limit to $72.50, I could sell that $72.50 Call at the same expir and take back some money, drop my overal cost on the spread, therefor bring down my breakeven. I could sell the $72.50 Call for 55c. Now my cost on the $67.50/72.50 Call spread is onli $2.40, my breakeven now $69.90, and I'll make more money up to $72.50 than I would have with the long call by itself.Anoth exampl is the credit spread. Rather than buy the aforement spread, if I'm bearish on GILD I can sell the spread. So instead of spend $2.40 for the spread I would pocket $2.40. My risk would be the $5 differ in the strike prices, minu the $2.40 I took in premium. So I risk $2.60 to make $2.40. Thi credit spread would max out or give me the largest possibl win outcom of $2.40 if share of GILD close at or below $62.50 at expir on March 17th.Myth #5: You Need a Special Account to Trade OptionsWell, sort of. While you do need to sign an option risk acknowledg form and get your account approv specif for option trading, it' not exactli a ""special account."" Pretti much ani non-qualified, or non-retirement, account is elig for option trading. I specifi non-qualifi becaus account like IRA are restrict as to the type of option trade you can do sinc you can't short stock in retir accounts.Ther are sever level of option approv out there, design to save investor from themselves. Each level or tier is restricted, onli allow certain type of trading. Each broker ha their own guidelin for what these level look like. All you realli need for approv is experi trade and capital. It' not like you have to be a millionair or anything.Bottom LineThos are the five biggest myth about option trade that scare off potenti traders. If you take the time to learn more about trade options, you'll find that they are a great way to manag your risk and gain exposur to the stock market.W the latest recommend from Zack Invest Research?

While he wa specif referenc the industry' capabl to deliv digit constant over a limit number of airwav frequencies, hi assess could just as easili appli to the mechan of deliv a wireless service.Cas in point: On Monday, rivalVerizon Commun Inc.(NYSE:VZ) announc it wasre-introduc unlimit data plans, look to garner (or recapture) wireless custom who have come to reli on handheld devic as media-deliveri vehicles.AT&T will be forc to respond, which - one way or anoth - will stake money off the bottom line.7 Tech Stock That Could Implod at Ani MinuteA T stock owner like know all too well, there' no room for give. Last quarter,th company' revenu fell just a bit. Incom fell considerably.Th rise in oper expens is abat after factor in amort and merger-related, but in light of the fact that theacquisit of DirecTV in May 2014wa suppos to be a busi build tool, anyth but top-lin growth is a disappoint - and a reflect of an increasingli competit space.I Time Warner the Answer?In other words, as wireless telecom servic increasingli becom a commod and, as a result, becom less profitable, what' AT&T to do to rekindl growth?Wheth it' the best use of time and money remain to be seen, but the telecom giant believ the acquisit of video and music compani Time Warner is the next best step.Thos plan wereunveil in October, with mix responses. While investor love the idea of meld a studio with a new distribut channel, consum and regul were a bit more skeptical. The concern lie in the fact that such a pair wouldgiv AT&T not just control of how we consum media(AT&T is the nation' second-biggest wireless provid and third-biggest broadband servic provider), but what media we even have access to. Time Warner is thepar of sever key televis channelsinclud HBO and CNN, as well as studio Warner Bros.Though it' technic a vertic integr and would theoret be a mere coincident pair of content creation and content delivery, the opportun for unfair is undeni even though pair the media and the messeng would creat efficiencies. Stephenson doesn't believ the union violat ani antitrust standards, however, and not just becaus the team-up wouldn't includ Time Warner' licenses.And if last quarter' result for Time Warner are ani indication, owner of AT&T stock should be hope the deal goe through. In it fourth fiscal quarter of 2016, the compani earn $1.25 per share on revenu of $7.89 billion. Analyst were onli look for a profit of $1.19 per share and a top line of $7.75 billion. Both figur were up by doubl digit versu year-ago comparisons, and the Q4 report extend a long and pretti reliabl string of growth.In other words, AT&T could use what Time Warner' got.Bottom Line for AT&T StockTh good news is, the merger with Time Warner is apt to proceed as planned, andthat' come from a former FCC commissioner. The vertical-integr natur of the pair rather than a horizont one is the key.3 Stock to Buy for Under $10 With 25%-Plu UpsideWhil the philosoph concern of a potenti monopoli aren't without merit, legal speaking, AT&T is right… there' no specif reason to assum that the compani will abus it relationship with a studio by limit access to third-parti entities. It' certainli push the envelop though. It' unlik that antitrust law foresaw where commun technolog and choic wa going, with the line between medium and media be thi blurred.Eith way, AT&T wants, and needs, thi deal to get done.A of thi writing, Jame Brumley held a posit in AT&T (T).More From InvestorPlace7 Stock to Sell or Short Befor the Bear Strike9 Top Pharmaceut Stock to Buy for the DividendsTak Tesla Inc (TSLA) Profits, Pour Them Into Twitter Inc (TWTR)The postClos the Deal With Time Warner Inc (TWX) Is a Must for AT&T Inc.

Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Stock Isn’t Done Correcting Yet,2/16/2017,"InvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsBusi forNvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA) appear to be fire on all cylinders, but the chart of NVDA stock are show a trend in motion that' a wee bit top-heavy. Thus, if you'r look to get on board one of the hottest stock of the past year, I have a trade idea that help discount some of the hype.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockIf we'r to believ Nvidia' latest earn report, it just doesn't get ani better. It wa a""great finish to a record year""a the compani top forecast and bump up guidance.But there lie the rub. NVDA stock is face with the possibl of becom a victim of it own success onandoff the price chart.Longer-term, Nvidia appear to be in all the right market pois for secular growth. From autonom vehicl to game to virtual realiti to cloud computing, NVDA is well-posit for continu success. You'll get no argument from me here.But Nvidia' success isn't exactli a secret at thi point, and that' becom a grow problem. For one, there' an inflat price for admission, with Nvidia stock sport lofti ratio such as a forward price-to-earn ratio of 33, price-to-sal of 8.5 and a price/earnings-to-growth ratio of 3.4.7 Stock Warren Buffett Is Buy or SellingPlus, NVDA now face rise oper costs, potenti gross margin compression, as well as data center, custom silicon and GPU workaround competition.Nvidia could prove a veri costli investment.Fail that, the chart of NVDA stock is warn that a day of reckon is nigh.Nvidia Stock ChartClick to EnlargeWith NVDA share up roughli 300% in the past 52 weeks, trader buy share today are place a lot of technic faith in extrem momentum continuing, rather than an overdu cycl of profit-tak beginning.In my view, bullish at Nvidia' current price is misplaced.Aft 10 month of price action remain tether to Nvidia' upper Bolling Band, share are form a bearish top candl on the monthli chart. That' after hit a brief and margin all-tim high in the immedi aftermath of the earn report.Even the best-sounding, well-support growth narr eventu give way to meaning price corrections, even if they eventu resum their rallies. I don't expect Nvidia stock to be an anomali to that durabl tendency.How to Trade NVDA Stock Right NowOn strategi that could allow you to profit from a correct in Nvidia and/or buy share at a discount is an out-of-the-money credit put spread.I suggest the March $100/$95 put vertical.Trad of the Day: Market Vector Gold Miner ETF (GDX) Wave a Bull FlagNVDA stock is at $108.90, and the trade is price at 60 cents.

The compani decid to chang it name to highlight that it make a varieti of other product in addit to it extens gun offerings, such as laser sight systems, knives, tree saws, and tactic light products. Moreover, American Outdoor Brand produc gun vault and accessories, along with gunsmith and reload tools.American Outdoor Brand ha seen it stock fall recently, in larg part becaus of the result of the U.S. presidenti elect in November. Mani believ that the stock would climb if the Democrat candid had won, with expect of stricter gun control restrict lead mani gun enthusiast to make purchas prior to ani such regul take effect. However, with the victori of Presid Trump, the urgenc among gun buyer is gone, and investor fear that American Outdoor Brand will see sale suffer as a result.However, American Outdoor Brands' strategi to emphas it broader product line should help it sustain growth in the long run. Even if sale fall now, American Outdoor Brand ha the qualiti and brand awar to prosper for long-term investors.Th cash to cure what ail itMatt DiLallo(Gilead Sciences): Share of biotech giant Gilead Scienc have stumbl over the past year, drop more than 35%. The stock recent hit anoth 52-week low after report disappoint fourth-quart earnings, with no clear sign of a turnaround in sight. The culprit is declin sale of it hepat C franchise, which isn't expect to turn around anytim soon.That said, Gilead still manag to gener a whop $16.7 billion of oper cash flow last year. It return most of that cash to shareholders, buy back $11 billion in stock and pay $2.5 billion in dividends. The compani also recent increas the dividend by 10% thank to that copiou cash flow. Even with those increas sharehold returns, the compani wa abl to add to it cash position, which stood at $32.4 billion at the end of last year.That cash posit might be just the medicin that cure the company' ail sale becaus it could use it to make a meaning acquisition, such as acquir a compani with a compel late-stag drug pipelin or a fast-sel drug. If Gilead can find the right deal, it could halt the stock' slide by give investor a reason to be optimist that sale can grow onc again.Polit attent = opportunityBrian Feroldi(CV Health): Chang are come to the Afford Care Act, while politician have been accus pharmaci benefit manag such as CV Health for drive up the cost of drugs.

TheTargetand Omnicar integr are go well, and sale of specialti drug are grow nicely. That' a lot of good thing happen for a stock trade near it 52-week low.Meanwhile, the compani continu to crank out cash flow that it gener pass back to sharehold in the form of a rise dividend and share buybacks. Yet CV Health' depress share price ha pull it valuat down to 13.5 time forward earnings. With a strong competit posit and a market-b yield of 2.5%, thi is a terrif stock to buy at today' dirt-cheap valuation.Th forgotten automakerTravi Hoium(Ford): Automak not namedTeslaar have a hard time get ani love in today' stock market. Ford ha made vast improv in the qualiti and attract of it vehicl sinc the recess subsided, and now it' churn profit quarter after quarter. And no one seem to care.F Revenu (TTM)data byYChartsWhat' impress about Ford today is that it' profit from the market' trend (SUV and trucks) while invest in futur technolog such as electr vehicl and autonom driving.

The Chevy Bolt EV Gets Off to a Strong Sales Start,2/12/2017,"Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO Elon Musk ha talk about creat an afford electr car for more than a decade. That car -- the Model 3 -- is final take shape. Test product could begin within the next few weeks, and Tesla hope tobegin mass product thi summer. Meanwhile, hundr of thousand of potenti custom have put down $1,000 refund deposit to reserv a place in line.However,Gener Motors(NYSE: GM) ha beaten Tesla to the punch with it own afford electr car, the Chevi Bolt. The 2017 Chevi Bolt went on sale in Decemb and is sell quit well so far. It may not match the Model 3 in term of total sales, but the Bolt is on it way to becom a key part of GM' vehicl lineup.A bolt from the blueTesla ha been talk up the Model 3 -- at least conceptu -- for a veri long time. A few year ago, it set 2017 as a target for begin production.makeArticleAd();Tesla still hope to start deliv the Model 3 sedan later thi year. Imag source: Tesla Motors.Thus, most industri observ were shock when GM showcas the Bolt concept car in earli 2015 and then quickli confirm that it would go into product with an on-sal date of late 2016. Thi allow the Chevi Bolt to make it to marketbefor the Model 3.The Chevi Bolt offer an impress EPA-estim 238 mile of range. It ha a start price of $37,495 and is elig for a $7,500 feder tax credit. (Some states, includ California, offer addit tax credits.) Furthermore, most review of the Bolt have been quit posit and have confirm that the advertis 238-mile rang hold up in real-world drive conditions.Strong sale out of the gateTh first Chevi Bolt arriv on dealer lot in December. GM dealer deliv 579 Bolt to custom that month. In January, avail improv modestli and sale doubl to 1,162 units.That may not seem like much compar to the nearli 200,000 vehicl GM dealer deliv in the U.S. dure January. However, the Bolt is onli avail in two state so far: California and Oregon. (To be fair, electr vehicl are particularli popular in those states.) Furthermore, inventori remain extrem low, with Chevi Bolt spend just seven day on dealers' lot on average.GM plan to gradual roll the Chevi Bolt out to more state over the cours of thi year. It will be avail in most West Coast and Northeast market by the spring, with nationwid avail schedul for September.Th Chevi Bolt will be avail nationwid by September.

In 2016, GM deliv 24,739 Volts, which wa a new record for the model.A key piec of the puzzleTh Chevi Bolt is like to remain a rel low-volum model for GM. However, as the company' first fulli electr car, it could prove to be veri import for the General.First, even if it isn't as cool as Tesla' Model 3, the Bolt may serv as a halo car for the Chevrolet brand, improv it imag among environment consciou consum and bring more peopl into dealerships.Second, if the Chevi Bolt sell rel well, it will help Gener Motor meet the EPA' aggress fuel economi target in the come years. Full-siz truck and SUV gener the lion' share of GM' profit and will continu to do so. However, in order to continu churn out those gas-guzzlers, GM also ha to produc some fuel-effici vehicles. With a 119 MPG-equival rating, the Bolt goe a long way in thi regard.Third, some state -- most notably, California -- requir automak tobuy zero-emiss vehicl creditsif they don't produc enough electr vehicles. The Chevi Bolt should reduc or elimin GM' need to buy these ZEV credit from rival like Tesla. (Not surprisingly, the Bolt will be avail in all 10 state on the ZEV credit system by May.)It' still earli in the rollout of the Chevi Bolt. However, so far, everyth seem to be go to plan.

There wa an urgenc that drove a boom in instal in 2016 when the invest tax credit (ITC) in the U.S. wa set to expire, but the extens in late 2015 took away ani urgenc for util to sign solar contract for 2017. Long-term, the extens will lead to more solar installations, but not until the 2018-2021 timeframe.China will also be a drag after instal a record 34.2 GW of solar (enough to power 5.6 million U.S. homes) in 2016 accord to the Chines Nation Energi Administration. No one quit know how much solar will be instal in China in 2017, but the NEA onli plan to averag 27.5 GW of instal over the next four year so it' safe to say instal will be down.Japan is anoth countri where the solar industri is in for a rough year. Accord to GTM Research, an estim 10.2 GW of solar wa instal in Japan in 2016, but that will drop to 8.8 GW in 2017 as feed-in tariff reduct hit. Japan is a high potenti solar market, but public polici hasn't kept up with potenti and that will keep a cap on growth short-term.Whi growth is on the horizonWhil these factor in the U.S., China, and Japan will drive a declin in solar instal in 2017, that doesn't mean the industri is head into a dark chapter. Solar energi ha never been cheaper and bid for new power plant are come in under 4 cent per kWh in some locations, a price that would beat ani new fossil fuel or nuclear plant on a cost basis.Imag source: SunPower.Emerg market like Chile, Mexico, Argentina, India, and the Middl East are start to see the potenti of solar as well. Mexico' recent auction result in clean energi contract with an averag price of 3.3 cent per kWh and given the low cost mani countri are follow with their own revers auction in 2017. Nearli four dozen countri could have energi auction thi year and that would lead to a boom in demand in 2018 and beyond.Solar energi is cost effect today, but energi project have thi lag between when peopl decid to go solar and when project are in the ground. That' the lull the market is in today. Lead develop like First Solar, SunPower, and Canadian Solar could will their backlog in 2018 and 2019, despit have a down year in 2017.Solar energi is still the futur of energyOv the past decad alone, solar energi ha grown from a 2 GW industri that could instal enough power gener to power 368,000 home per year to an industri giant that instal 74 GW, or enough to power 12.1 million homes, in the last year alone. And growth wa driven by a whop 90% drop in solar panel cost as technolog improv across the industry.2017 may be a down year for the solar industri for a varieti of reasons, but it doesn't fundament chang the fact that solar energi is the most abund energi sourc in the world and the cost to gener solar power is now lower than fossil fuel in most of the world.Lik it or not, the solar boom is realli just begin and 2017 will be a calm befor what could be anoth 16 year of consecut growth for solar energy.10 stock we like better than Wal-MartWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

We'r talk about HBO'sBecom Warren Buffett, it air on the 30th.Muckerman:Oh, you didn't get a free subscription?O'Reilly:No. I'm go to watch it thi weekend. Actually, I probabl will sign up for the free trial. Anyway, bottom line, I actual knew thi stuff had a futur when Buffett start invest in windmills. I wa like, ""Oh, thi is actual economical,"" becaus he doe not do thing that are not go to make him money. We saw that one statist about Alaska. What' up with those guys?Muckerman:When you think Alaska, you think oil, generally. They have a lot of it; they'r produc a lot of it. And kodiaks, and stuff like that. But thi is a state that, they basic give a paycheck to all their citizen from all the oil revenu that they make on an annual basis. And what they'r see is, solar and wind is actual cheaper in a lot of place than oil and diesel, becaus you'r look at some places, the more remot area of Alaska, they need to use diesel, of all things, to gener electricity. We'r look at upward of $0.60 per kilowatt-hour. Meanwhile, you'r look at some peopl that are gener energi from hydro and wind in the citi of Kodiak, and you'r look at about $0.11 per hour. So a sixth of what they'r pay on the diesel side. And that seem to be a theme. Texas, one of the fastest-grow renew energy-gener state in the country, tradit all oil and natur ga when you think about it. Right on par with California, which produc it own share of natur gas, but not nearli what Texa is doing. So Alaska, Texas, see that renew energi is final at pariti or below pariti with fossil fuel electr generation.O'Reilly:So, what am I to take away from this? Are peopl just invest in thi becaus they'r like, ""Oh, we need more electricity, so we'r just go to invest in thi becaus of regulations""? Or is thi actual be done in the place where is economical, and that' it? How are busi make decis here?Muckerman:Well, it' becom econom in more place everi day. Even if you think, Donald Trump appoint all these folk that are close tie to the fossil-fuel industry, but on hi list of infrastructur projects, he ha a lot on there that support the renewable-energi industri --O'Reilly:You'r kidding, what?Muckerman:Project like, a lot of transmiss line so that you can build the infrastructur for these companies, so that they can actual get the power from a wind plant. He ha thi Plain & Eastern electr transmiss line project, which is tri to move wind energi from the western tip of Oklahoma 720 mile south to --O'Reilly:That sound like the Picken Plan, rememb that?Muckerman:-- southeast to Memphis. And that' enough clean energi for 1 million home in the Mid-South. So that' just one area. That' not actual build the wind turbines, but it' allow that power to be effici distribut to places. Obviously, if you think about Memphis' popul compar to the plain of Western Oklahoma, it' a littl bit more dens populated. So right now, those wind turbin probabl aren't be use to the effici and the efficaci that they should be. But then, you have hydroelectr plant planned, more transmiss lines, wind power, energi storag and grid modern target minim the magnitud of potenti blackout in California by increas storag for renew energy. All told, it say that the project could add about 9 gigawatt of clean power if they are all final and put into place. So that' roughli about a third of all the energi capac that we have ad in the last year, just in a few of these project that Trump ha laid out in hi initi infrastructur plan.O'Reilly:Correct me if I'm wrong, but as I just mentioned, that sound a lot like the Picken Plan. Do you rememb that, in 2008, T. Boon Picken wa like, ""You have thi energi corridor from The Dakota down to Oklahoma, you have all thi wind, you need to get it to the coast,"" and he want to build these huge transmiss lines? And one of the problem is they need to be enormous, becaus if you'r send electr over long distances, you lose some of it. It' actual veri difficult. That' kind of exciting.Muckerman:Yeah. A lot of these project are be built by privat companies, so it' veri fragmented, almost on a state-by-st basis. If you go to the SEIA website, the Solar Energi Industri Association, they put out a report from Septemb 2016 that basic list everi project that' online, be constructed, or in develop in the entir Unit States. The list is 30-40 page long, becaus there are just so mani small compani that are out there build one plant, two plants. Mayb eventu they will get bought up, or mayb some of those are part of a bigger hold corp. But it' veri wide distributed. It' not all public compani that are do this. Generally, if you think about the supplier of these wind turbin and solar panels, those are --O'Reilly:Lik aGener Electricor something.Muckerman:Yeah, those are come from publicli trade compani like a Gener Electric, like aSiemens. Then on the solar-panel side you haveFirst SolarandSunPower, and thenSolarCityon the residenti side. They'r actual provid the solar panel and do some installation. But a lot of the folk that are build these and oper them are privat companies, for now.O'Reilly:Awesome. So, Mr. Muckerman, it sound like in the Unit States, solar is becom common.Muckerman:Ad jobs, ad clean energy, be support by state that you might not think would support clean energy, and even Donald Trump is support it.O'Reilly:And it' becaus of economics.Muckerman:Yes. Flat-out.O'Reilly:So, solar is go in where there is sun; wind is go where there' wind. It' cost effective.Muckerman:Yeah. I'm pretti sure they even just approv the largest offshor wind farm in U.S. histori off Long Island. So, there' that.O'Reilly:For New York City, yeah.Muckerman:Yeah. If you look at the Northeast, they'r pretti underserved. At least, natur ga energi hit New York and doesn't make it past New York. So the New England area is definit hurt for natur ga and renew energy.O'Reilly:It wa a big learn experi for me when I saw both how need and difficult it is to get natur ga line up there in the Northeast. It' like a web, and there' not enough. It' kind of crazy.Muckerman:They'r tri to build them, but not quickly.O'Reilly:It' dens populated; it' actual kind of difficult. Realli quick, befor we talk about some more specifics, like in a contin like Africa with the sunlight it get and everyth and how, with solar, you can put up a solar panel and power something, it' decentralized. That will obvious see some growth, and we'll discuss that in a minute. But I want to quickli go down a list. Thi is enormous. There' a group call The Renew Energi Polici Network for the 21st Century. They, everi year, put out of a report on the global statu report of renew energy. You can go to ren21.net and check it out. They do thi everi June, so we have last June' report, and it mostli cover 2015. But anecdotally, thi sort of thing doesn't get chang a lot. Thi thing is page and page long! All right, let' do a quiz. Where do you think --Muckerman:Oh, I have the list right in front of me.O'Reilly:Oh, you do?Muckerman:Yeah. I can't cheat on air.O'Reilly:Shut your computer!Muckerman:I'v seen it; it' too late.O'Reilly:Al right, fine.Muckerman:W can quiz our listeners. Give them five second to guess.O'Reilly:Al right, our listen can check thi out. Googl ""2016 report.""Muckerman:Sorry. I ruin it. You sent it to me.O'Reilly:I'm not go to forget this. No, I did. What stuck out to you there? You have China beat us for invest in renew fuel --Muckerman:And total capac or gener as of the end of 2015 for all renew power. That' onli set to accelerate, I think, you'r look at China expect to, accord to Reuters, plow $361 billion into renewable-energi power gener by 2020 -- $361 billion. That will creat 13 million jobs, they estimate. And that' just over a five-year period from 2016 to 2020.O'Reilly:Th per-capita number were hilari to me. Invest in renew power and fuel per unit of GDP, No. 1 wa Mauritania, then Honduras, Uruguay, Morocco, and Jamaica. Renew power capac per capita, No. 1 is of cours Denmark, Germany, Sweden. But, dollar for dollar, it' pretti much us, China, Germany, a littl Japan and the U.K. in there.Muckerman:Yeah, Japan is No. 3 in term of invest in 2015. Then the U.K., and then India.O'Reilly:Which is not surprising, becaus they had the nuclear problem, they have no natur resources, they don't have oil, so it' like, what are we go to do here?Muckerman:Mak total sense, and they'r surround by ocean.O'Reilly:A littl tricki there. I wa surpris by how big biomass energi is. Is that the landfills, and it ha methan burn it --Muckerman:Yeah, the waste, heat, thing like that.O'Reilly:I wa surpris by how big that was.Muckerman:Yeah, not too shabby. A decent amount. If you think about how much we actual do waste, it' smart to use it.O'Reilly:Yeah. It' physics. Thi is just energy; it' like wind. These thing happen.Muckerman:Energi can never be creat or destroyed.O'Reilly:Oh, man. That' veri Zen of you.Muckerman:Isn't that someth that they say in physics?O'Reilly:Yeah. All right, let' dive in here to a few uniqu interest situations. Saudi Arabia. They obvious have a ton of sunlight, but ...Muckerman:What are they well known for, besid sunlight?O'Reilly:Oh, I don't know, mayb they'r known for go out into the desert and stick a straw in the sand and get oil.Muckerman:And they are expect to dump between $30 [billion] and $50 billion into major renew energi by 2023. So not nearli on the same level as China, but still.O'Reilly: Well, what wa the Saudi Aramco, the oil compani that might be IPO- in a year or two, they'r talk about dabbl in it a littl bit, I saw thi morning.Muckerman:Mayb $5 billion in renewable-energi deals, yeah. They'v askedHSBC, [JPMorgan Chase], andCredit Suisseto go out there and tri to find some compani that they might be abl to buy with $5 billion of cash lie around.O'Reilly:What do you think Saudi Arabia is thinking? I see a coupl possibilities, or mayb it' all of them. Is this, we need to shift away from oil becaus someday we'r not go to be abl to use it?Muckerman:Yeah, I think the last coupl year wa a gut check for them, becaus oil provid a pretti decent amount of subsidi for the social program they have. So they'v been lose out on a lot of that revenue. So they'r tri to at least intern reduc their demand on oil.O'Reilly:So they can sell more oil?Muckerman:Yeah, I think that probabl ha someth to do with it. Also, they power their countri with oil.O'Reilly:I wa about to say, they are one of the few countri that burn oil for their electr grid.Muckerman:Yeah. So if they can make electr cheaper, then whi not? They'r look to grow up to about to about 30% of their power from low-carbon sourc by 2030. Right now, they have about 10 gigawatt of power from wind, solar, and nuclear.O'Reilly:Sweet. I have to think they'r tri to play catch-up with the UAE, too. They'v been do a lot with solar.Muckerman:I mean, they'r right there' it' the desert; they have plenti of sun right along the equator.O'Reilly:Yeah, exactly. What els stuck out to you as you look around the globe? As I mentioned, I'm optimist about Africa becaus instal the transmiss line for tradit central power like we have, like a natur gas-burn power plant or something, it' a littl bit of a hassle.Muckerman:Well, if you think about it in term of what they have done with telephones, for example. They'v pretti much skip land line and went right to cellphones. So if you think about it, it' a similar situation. You have a cell-phon tower rather than telephon line crisscross the country. You can liken a cellphon tower to a solar grid, becaus they can be place sporad around the countri and distribut in the region where they'r needed. So I think that' probabl what' go to happen. It' just go to skip tradit power gener and go straight to renewable, more region distribution, as needed.O'Reilly:It almost seem like renew are the best thing that ever happen for develop nations. I mean, that' pretti darn useful.Muckerman:Now that it' cost-effective, yeah. Beforehand, they were just kind of wait on it. Compani want to invest. Foreign direct invest is a big thing in thi world. I don't know if it' go to be African compani that are build these solar and wind and hydroelectr power plants, but somebodi is go to do it becaus there' money to be made.O'Reilly:Right. So I'm an investor, you'r an investor, we'r all Fools, we'r all investors. How do you get in on this? What do you see as the reason way to make money off these trends?Muckerman:For me, personally, I would probabl look at the bigger provid of the equipment. Like we mentioned, a few, GE kind of hedg your bet a littl bit, becaus they'r involv in oil and gas, and also, they have exposur to renewable-energi sources. So I think that kind of hedg your bet a littl bit.O'Reilly:Th hardwar is like, eh, what do you think about an advanc solar-panel manufacturer, like aCanadian Solaror something?Muckerman:They have had their troubles.O'Reilly:If you can't see him, he' winc right now.Muckerman:That' just becaus these compani have gone in waves. One compani make an advancement, and everyon jump on their bandwagon, and then somebodi else' solar-panel cell becom more efficient, so everybodi jump ship and start use them.O'Reilly:It' like computers.Muckerman:Yeah. So that' whi I would say big hold compani like GE or Siemen to get access to wind power. Then, compani that are effect ad solar power at util scale. I think that' realli where you'r go to make your money. So MidAmerican might be a good choice, or SunPower, which is a more global company. You see SunPow instal solar panels, and First Solar, too, all over the world. SunPow is fortun enough to have the back ofTotal, which is a forward-think oil and ga company.O'Reilly:Right. What do they own, 30% of that thing?Muckerman:It might be more, it' at least 30%. They may have up their stake in the past coupl years. I'm not 100% sure.O'Reilly:That wouldn't surpris me.Muckerman:Then there' anoth compani that' hedg it bet between tradit fossil fuel and renew energi -- Total, a French company. There' just a few to point out. Bu, like I said earlier, a lot of these compani are private. You have to do some digging, but mayb you could hold a portfolio of a few of these companies, littl bit and piec of each, rather than bet your entir portfolio of renew energi on one or two companies. You can, maybe, buy a basket of them.O'Reilly:Awesome. Yeah, the bottom line, it sound like, is that thi trend is happening. It is becom increasingli common in more and more places.Muckerman:Yeah, it sure is. You think aboutTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA)and SolarC be combin with some help from Panason and that lithium-batteri factory. If energi storag doe happen, which, I think it would have to from renewable-energi sources, the Tesla Gigafactori out there in California is look to build more batteri than the entir capac to build batteri worldwid is right now. So they'r expect the need to be there.O'Reilly:Awesome.Muckerman:If you don't have renewable-energi generation, you don't need those batteries. So they'd better pray that the trend continues, which I expect it to.O'Reilly:Awesome. All right. Thank for your thoughts, Mr. Muckerman.Muckerman:Well, what are you look at? Let' get some thought from you realli quick befor we head out. You mention one company? 8point3?O'Reilly:Yeah. We'r short on time. Thank you for the shout-out, though. I'm kind of conserv with thi sort of thing. One, I'm not a tech person. I don't know which solar panel is the best, that sort of thing. But I like the monopolist characteristics, the cash gener characterist of those yieldco that get spun out, and they just build huge solar projects. They send the electr into the grid. That' it. 8point3 Energi Partner ha a 7% yield, it' kind of guaranteed. I mean, it' meat and potatoes.Muckerman:Unless the sun start charg for it rays, then these compani are sit kind of pretti in the long run.O'Reilly:Right. Cool. All right. That is it for us, folks.

2 Brilliant Ways NVIDIA Corporation Is Investing in the Future,2/9/2017,"Investor followingNVIDIA Corporation(NASDAQ: NVDA) alreadi know that the compani is a clear leader in the graphic process unit (GPU) space as it hold more than 70% of the discret desktop GPU market share right now.NVIDIA earn about 62% of it total revenu from sale of GPU in it game segment, but the compani isn't satisfi with just kick up it feet and reap the benefit of that. Instead, NVIDIA is use it GPU knowledg to begin domin two futur markets: self-driv technolog and data centers.Imag source: Getti Images.makeArticleAd();Hit the ga on self-driv technologyIt' hard to write about NVIDIA' futur without talk about semi-autonm driving. That' becaus auto are a clear area of focu for the compani and becaus NVIDIA ha alreadi taken an earli lead.NVIDIA use it GPU to process imag from on-board camera mount on semi-autonom car so that the vehicl know what they'r look at (i.e., a move car vs. a dumpster). NVIDIA' supercomputer, call Drive PX 2, is on it second iter alreadi and is use by more than 80 automak and Tier 1 automot supplier to deliv high level of semi-autonom features.Teslai the latest carmak to begin use NVIDIA' technolog for self-driv capabilities, and there are plenti of reason investor should be optimist that NVIDIA' current automot invest are just get started.Th compani earn $127 million from it automot segment in fiscal Q3 2017, which wa a 60% increas year over year. While that figur isn't a lot of money for the compani -- it repres just over 6% of NVIDIA' top line in the quarter -- it' worth mention that the overal driverless car market is expect to be worth $77 billion by 2035.Tesla' commit to it ongo releas of new semi-autonom drive tech, Google'snewli creat Waymoself-driv car company, andBaidu' aggress self-driv technolog test in China all point to a come futur of semi-autonom and fulli autonom vehicles.IHSAutomot predict that the world could reach driverless car ubiqu about 30 year from now -- and NVIDIA is creat some of the technolog right now to make that a reality.Data center risingAsid from automot tech, the other area NVIDIA is invest it futur in is data centers. Thi segment ha been part of the company' busi for a while, but recently, NVIDIA ha doubl it effort to expand into new data center market -- and it' pay off enormously.In fiscal Q3 2017, the compani earn $240 million from it data center segment, a stagger increas of 192% year over year. When ask about the company' data center growth, CEO Jen-Hsun Huang said NVIDIA ha been creat new opportun in the space like virtualization, deep learning, and comput science.Data center revenu account for about 12% of the company' top line in the third quarter, but investor should keep in mind that thi segment is the company' fastest-grow business, and it ha some of the highest margin as well. NVIDIA believ it data center address market is worth $5 billion, make it a massiv revenu opportun for the company' future.Just the beginningNVIDIA had a tremend 2016, with the company' stock price skyrocket 229%, and that' left investor understand wonder if there' more where that came from. We'll know a bit more when the compani releas it fourth-quart 2017 result later thi week, but no matter what happens, investor should look to NVIDIA' long-term pursuit outsid of it core game segment. NVIDIA' focu on automot technolog and data center could be two huge growth area in the come year -- and they'r futur opportun investor shouldn't overlook.10 stock we like better than NvidiaWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Why You Should (and Shouldn't) Buy NVIDIA,2/9/2017,"NVIDIA(NASDAQ: NVDA) , the graphics-chip maker and leader in the burgeon virtual-r and driverless-car markets, ha been on an absolut tear over the past 12 months, with share up over 340%. At thi point, it' natur for investor to wonder if it' too late to buy a few share -- thi run could just be the start of NVIDIA' path to world domination, or it could be the veri top of a bubble-lik valuation.Whil the truth probabl lie somewher in the middle, there are certain type of investor who should, and shouldn't, invest in NVIDIA no matter what the realiti is. So with thi fundament truth in mind, we ask two of The Motley Fool' best and brightest just who should (and shouldn't) invest in NVIDIA. Here' what they had to say.makeArticleAd();Imag source: Getti Images.Y firmli believ in the growth storyChri Neiger: NVIDIA ha caught the eye of mani tech investor with it stock price run-up in 2016. The investor optim is more than just speculation, though. NVIDIA is alreadi a domin forc in the GPU market, with more than 70% of the discret desktop GPU market share, and it show no sign of cede it lead to rivalAMD. That' important, becaus the compani bring in about 62% of it total revenu from it game GPU segment.If that were the onli thing go for NVIDIA, it would probabl be enough. But one of the reason thi compani is so excit is that it' take what it know about GPU and appli it to all-new growth market -- namely, semi-autonom drive and high-powered, artifici intellig supercomputers. The company' DGX-1 comput use deep learn and artificial-intellig analyt to gener as much process power as 250 convent servers. Data-cent revenu is NVIDIA' second-largest busi segment, and the compani is prove it can innov like no other in the space.In the semi-autonomous-driv market, NVIDIA' Drive PX 2 supercomput is be use as the onboard comput for mani self-driv vehicles. The comput use NVIDIA' GPU to process visual inform in real time and give car a type of situat awareness. Eighti automak and Tier 1 automot supplier are alreadi use NVIDIA' Drive PX system, andTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) just becam one of NVIDA' most recent customers. Some investor may be scare away by the company' pricey P/E ratio of 74, but NVIDIA should continu to be a long-term growth stori as long as the compani continu grow game revenu at a healthi clip and it invest in AI and semi-autonom drive continu to pay off.Becaus everyon els isSean O'Reilly: NVIDIA remain the undisput king of advanc graphic chips. What' more, thank to it NVIDIA Drive PX 2 comput platform, it ha a respect stake in the futur of driverless carsandartifici intelligence. Given these catalysts, it' shouldn't have been surpris that NVIDIA wa one of the best perform stock of 2017. Yet that awe-inspir perform is precis where the danger in invest in the compani now lies.To invest in ani company, not just NVIDIA, you need to believ in that compani and perform your due diligence. You need to read confer calls, have faith in management' vision for the future, and find the current valuat compelling, becaus at some point, your faith in the compani will be tested. It' not unheard of for a stock that' reward sharehold with huge gain in a short period to fall, 10%, 20%, or even 30%, onli to then rocket ever higher -- leav those who sold in the pullback out in the cold.NVIDIA ha a fantast suit of offerings, led by it GeForce, PureVideo, nForce, GoForce, and Quadro chips, and a foothold in a number of potenti huge markets. NVIDIA is except at what it doe -- but they are not unassail (yet) and it' worth repeat that those big catalyst arepotentiallyhug markets. Right now, the compani is a non-monopolist business, play in nascent tech segments, and it' price at 40 time forward FY 2017 earnings. Even further out, the compani current trade at 23 time FY 2020 estim earnings, as estim byS&P Global Market Intelligence. If NVIDIA stumbl with quarterli result or offer up guidanc that impli the busi will slow down, the stock price will more than like take a hit as expect of futur profit normalize.Bottom line: Don't just buy into NVIDIA becaus it' the current hot stock. Investor interest in the busi need to have the stomach for growth investing. You will be tested, and the last thing you want to do with a great busi like NVIDIA is to sell out when Mr. Market throw a fit.Off from the Motley Fool: The 10 best stock to buy nowMotley Fool co-found Tom and David Gardner have spent more than a decad beat the market.

How Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM) Stock Benefits From Tillerson’s Appointment,2/9/2017,"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsPolit pundit were gener aghast when Presid Donald J. Trump appoint then-CEO ofExxon Mobil Corporation(NYSE:XOM), Rex Tillerson, to the post of Secretari of State. The prevail wisdom that somehow thi posit had to be fill by someon from government, with polit experience, wa blown to bits.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockWelcom to the Trump administration, which is defin itself by blow up the way thing are ""normal done.""Sinc that announcement, other news have alter my theori regard whi Tillerson wa named, but onli cosmetically, and I believ it is veri good news for XOM sharehold over the long term.Few peopl had like heard of the joint ventur between XOM and Russia' state-own oil explor and product operation,Rosneft(OTCMKTS:RNFTF). Exxon creat astrateg agreementto ""establish the framework for joint oil explor and product in Russia, the Unit States, and other countries,"" accord to Exxon. Ten joint ventur for project in the Russian Arctic, Black Sea and Siberia have sinc been set up.Of course, push thi forward becam difficult becaus the U.S. place sanction on Russia.Mi expect had been that Trump would lift sanction on Russia in exchang for some kind of agreement to partner on attack Isis, or some cosmet withdraw from Crimea or Ukraine. Then, Exxon could get back to work with Rosneft. Who better to negoti thi deal with Putin that the most recent CEO of Exxon Mobil?In a shock coincid (yes, that' sarcasm), Putin suddenlyannouncedthat it had sold 19.5% stake in Rosneft to a mysteri Singapor invest group, allegedli a 50-50 JV between Swiss and Qatari oil firms. Yet, nobodi seem to know who fund about 25% of the purchase, and whi some portion of the ownership is a Cayman Island compani belong to an unidentifi owner.Mi work theori is that Trump is all about deals. Say what you will about Putin, but at the end of the day, polit is about deals. Putin will make deals. Not onli is Tillerson a deal-maker, but he know politics. He' been all over the world, travers all kind of polit landscap to make deal for hi global oil company! Duh!12 Stock That Will Live and Die by Donald Trump' PenAl of these move part are, I believe, gear toward move the XOM-Rosneft project forward. I'm go to guess that someth about the Russian sanction may not appli if Russia own less than a certain amount.Aft thi sale, the Russian state own about 55%. Interestingly,BP plc (ADR)(NYSE:BP) also ownsa 20% stakein Rosneft. About 5% is publicli traded. If Russian state ownership fall under 50%, and we see Rosneft' project start up, we'll have our answer.I'm also will to bet that the mysteri buyer of thi recent sale are ultim tie directli to the Russian state or Putin himself. It just look like it isn't.Now, what doe thi mean for Exxon Mobil stock? It' all good. The Russian Arctic is expect to hold ton of oil, not to mention the other area of the joint venture. One ha to assum that XOM stock is go to benefit becaus Exxon ha alreadi deploy asset and human capit over there. It may not exactli be a matter of flip a switch, but the project are much farther along than tri to hunt and contract for new area to explore.Nor doe XOM have to get involv with the bad PR that would result from want to drill in protect area here in the U.S.Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Sock the Short With the Model 3Thus, XOM is in the catbird seat. Russia want the oil, also, so both countri can be less depend on oil from the Middl East. That could also mean the countri will partner on tri to erad Radic Islam terrorism.

In full disclosure, I'v been slow to warm to Nvidia' invest appeal, and in the meantime, NVDA stock ha nearli tripled.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockTh key to the forthcom earn releas will be growth - just like it is for ani company. So far, the earn momentum and increas in analyst project suggest Nvidia' prospect are bright.But will NVDA stock holder have to toler some bump along the way?Nvidia Earn ExpectationsIn mylast updateon Nvidia in earli December, I suggest keep an eye on earn trends. At that time, full-year earn estim (the averag of the earn all analyst cover the name expect the compani to report) had jump nearli 32% - from $1.84 to $2.42 per share. It' a key reason NVDA stock ha ralli so strongly.Th current full-year estim for Nvidia earn (accord to Yahoo Finance) is $2.41 per share. It relay that 19 analyst have provid estimates. That' about flat over the past 60 days, but actual down slightli from the $2.45 project 30 day ago.But really, thi is split hairs. It' veri like NVDA report a solid quarter in term of bottom-lin growth.7 High-Risk, High-Reward Stock to Buy NowAnd sale growth is project to bestellar. Analyst expect at least a 36% annual bump to $6.84 billion. Next year, top-lin growth is project to slow to 16% for full-year sale of nearli $8 billion; 2018 profit are current peg at $2.71 per share.Th Busi Case for NVDA StockWith a current share price of $117.40, the forward price-to-earn ratio on NVDA stock sit right below 50. That' a rather lofti multiple, and it essenti mean that Nvidiamustgrow rapidly. Otherwise, that quickli surg share price could take a similarli speedi tumble.Fortunately, Nvidia oper in some of the most excit growth area for semiconductors. The compani is best-known for graphic chips, and in particular it graphic process units, or GPUs. The compani boast it is the ""world leader"" in visual computing. Thi look accur - a recentBarron'sarticlepeg it GPU market share at 68%. Thi is one of the most compel space in the semiconductor industry.Nvidia' chip are an integr compon in the ecosystem that are pioneer growth in virtual reality, cloud computing, machin learning, and self-driv cars. These are some huge disrupt industri that could end up revolution mani facet of the gaming, computing, and automot industries.Th company' game busi is the largest oper unit and grow 30% per year on averag sinc 2013. It data center busi (to support cloud computing) is expand at a more rapid clip - 40% annually. And automot is skyrocket 75% annually, though from a veri small initi base.In some respects, and provid you are comfort with the lofti valuation, Nvidia is a veri compel way for broad exposur to multipl disrupt industries.NVDA add exposur to the cloud-comput excit that is creat a buzz at giant tech firm includingAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN),Microsoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) andAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL).Tesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) is in the pole posit in the autonom automobil charge. The Nvidia Drive PX 2 comput platform current power the Tesla auto model that alreadi have self-driv capabilities.Th CompetitionMor direct competitor includeIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) andAdvanc Micro Devices, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMD), both of which are look to grow in these newer markets. Both key rival are also like to benefit from GPU use to power game systems, machin learning, and server use for cloud computing.Intel is somewhat hamstrung from it domin market share in person computing. It 80% market share to power person comput and relat devic ha liter result in hundr of billion of dollar in cash flow over the past sever decades. Thi give it unmatch rivalri to invest in new technolog and keep a leadership posit over chip competitors. But comput is matur and bare expanding.Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Sock the Short With the Model 3AMD had been thought to have lost it way. Year of mismanag allow Intel to expand on it domin and nearli put AMD out of business. But new manag appear to have reinvigor AMD, and investor are start to believ it can also benefit from the same market Nvidia is pursuing.Bottom Line on NVDA StockIn arec interview, market strategist Ed Yardeni peg semiconductor stock as one of hi favorit industri for 2017. In hi words, ""we'r talk about major secular disrupt in autos, consum electronics, and gaming."" Chip that power data warehous to serv the rise in cloud comput repres yet anoth market for these firms.NVDA stock is an investor' best bet to gain exposur to these markets. The rub, of course, is it valuat alreadi reflect mani more year of rapid growth.AMD is an interest turnaround play, though with it current low level of profitability, the trade multipl are also lofty. Intel is a much safer bet in the microchip space. It forward P/E is below 15, and there is a modest dividend yield of 2.86% that should grow over time.I suggest take a wait-and-se approach to Nvidia earnings.

In less than 140 characters, Musk said hehop to enter the Indian market by thi summer.Th knee-jerk respons is optimism; enter new market mean more revenu potential. It' the second thought that rais questions, though. India is a poor country, per capita. The averag annual incom in India is $5,630. Worse, median incom is $616. It' not like mani of those consum are even think about buy a TSLA vehicle.There' a curiou nuanc with the way India' incom is distributed, though.In India, the richest 1% of the countri control 58% of the nation' wealth. That' one of the world' most extrem level of wealth disparity. And when you'r talk abouta countri with a popul of 1.33 billion, it doesn't take a larg proport of the popul to creat a decent-s pool of potenti buyers.And for what it' worth, the more manufactur Musk can do in that countri rather than import vehicl into India, the better, in term of marketability. At the same time, though it consum still aren't as flush as they are in other part of the world, that' changing.Manhattan Ventur Partners' Santosh Rao recent opined, ""The market opportun is too compel to ignore.

Earnings Preview: Guidance Is Key for Pandora Media Inc (P) Stock,2/8/2017,"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsIt seem unlik that from a fundament standpoint, there will be a lot of news in thePandora Media Inc(NYSE:P) earn report on Thursday.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockPandora alreadi announc last month that fourth-quart result would come in ahead of guidanc for both revenu and adjust Ebitda. That disclosur sent P stock up 6%, and would seem to limit the possibl that the number in the Pandora earn report will boost the stock further.That doesn't mean there will be no news come out of Pandora earnings. The compani ha set itself up for a busi 2017. The replac of Pandora One with Pandora Plu appear to have had some success in the fourth quarter. Commentari on that initi will be close watch on the Q4 confer call.Meanwhile, in December, Pandora announc a new ""Premium"" servic to compet with offer fromSpotify,Appl Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) and others.12 Stock That Will Live and Die by Donald Trump' PenThat product should roll out shortly, potenti boost growth in 2017. And Pandora ha said it is aim to return to Ebitda profit in 2017. The Q4 report should give some color as to whether investor in P stock should believ the company.A Busi 2017 for Pandora StockPandora stock actual is up about 65% over the past year, after come close to all-tim low in earli 2016. Those gain have come despit mix perform in the business. Revenu is up 14% through the first nine months, and like rose a similar figur in Q4. But about half the year-to-d growth came from the acquisit of TicketFli last October. Advertis revenu also increas 14% through the first three quarter - but came sole from higher pricing. Activ user were actual down year-over-year at the end of Q3, and subscript revenu declin in the quarter as well.Th user and subscript figur are a major problem for Pandora stock. The market simpli doesn't trust that Pandora can creat consist profit base on advertis revenu alone. That' particularli true given thehigh royalti ratesthat took effect at the begin of last year. So the move by Pandora to upgrad One to Plu - ad featur like song replay - and to develop Premium are a clear step toward a subscription-bas model.Th plan from Pandora, as detail after the third quarter, is for that type of model to provid a more stabl revenu base. Move custom to subscription-bas servic both help margin and improv retention. If Pandora is successful, Pandora stock like will rise. But that remain a rel big ""if.""What to Watch for in Pandora EarningsIn the Pandora earn report, then, the most import number like will come from the company' guidance. That guidanc will give some color as to how success manag think Plu ha been so far - and what kind of opportun Premium ha to boost Pandora earn thi year.But the Pandora earn confer call also seem like it might move P stock. Manag will have anoth opportun to detail it strategi for 2017 and beyond. The compani laid out it ""three-leg stool"" strategi - Plus, Premium and Ticketfli - after the third quarter, but investor weren't terribl impressed. Pandora stock fell about 14% over the next seven sessionsTh issu with P stock is that there' a real fear that Pandora' model simpli doesn't quit work. The product itself is attractive, as evidenc by the nearli 80 million activ users. But it' not clear that Pandora can pay higher royalti rate through ad revenu alone. The compani did announc layoff ofabout 7%of it employe in a bid to improv 2017 profits. That simpli rais addit concern about Pandora stock. The most notabl is: Can Pandora realli compet with Apple, Spotifi andAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN)?Aft all, those compani have much larger busi - and much more cash - than Pandora. P stock still is worth almost $3 billion, yet the compani ha burn about $127 million in cash just in the first three quarter of 2016. Full-year Ebitda loss is like to be huge as well, and that' not count depreci or the addit $139 million in Pandora stock awards.Mak Free Profit From Tesla Inc (TSLA) StockFor Pandora stock to appreci in the near term, the compani need to get at least close to breakeven in 2017. So full-year guidanc given in the Pandora earn report will be key. But that aside, investor also will be look for more inform on the plan go forward here.Can Pandora find a nich in the music industry? Is Pandora Premium ""too little, too late"" against the offer from Spotify, Amazon and Apple? And is there realli a profit busi model here, or are royalti rate simpli too difficult to manage?Thos question can't be answer quit yet, but investor will be look at the Pandora earn report close to better assess the company' prospects. And it' like the commentari on the futur - not the past - that will determin how Pandora stock react to Q4 earnings.A of thi writing, Vinc Martin did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.

How the Allure of Growth Led Solar Installers Down a Destructive Path,2/4/2017,"In business, get the strategi and time right can often be a lot more import over the long term than have the best product or technology. In solar, mani compani have fail becaus they took the wrong path to market or bet on the wrong product at the wrong time.In that vein, one lesson worth look at right now is how some solar compani had the right long-term strategi for residenti solar, but abandon it too earli in a pursuit of short-term growth. Below is a look at how compani likeSunrun(NASDAQ: RUN) could have put themselv into domin posit today, but are instead now at a disadvantage. And how major player likeTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) ,SunPower(NASDAQ: SPWR) , andVivintSolar(NYSE: VSLR) will fit into the market.Imag source: Getti Images.makeArticleAd();Th shift trend of residenti solarThere' been a lot of debat over the past five year about what the best strategi is for residenti solar installers. Among the notabl questions: Is a large, nation footprint valuable, or should compani be more focus on local or region markets?In general, larger compani have better technolog for quot rooftop solar system prices, and better access to self financ (leases); smaller compani tend to have lower instal costs, but less access to capit within their control.Ther are a few move piec there, but thi gener allow larg instal like Tesla and Vivint Solar to grow more quickli and gave them an incent to get more custom sign up for leas or power purchas agreement (PPAs). Small instal didn't see the same growth becaus of loans, so custom could buy their system weren't readili avail (until recently). Thi left smaller player at a disadvantage.Thi dynam led to massiv market share gain for major, nation instal from 2010 to 2015 as they broaden their reach, brought down their financ costs, and lower instal costs. But in 2016, someth changed. Loan becam easier for smaller instal to offer, give them a chanc to leverag their lower costs. You can see below that growth shift quit quickli from larg instal to smaller instal last year, a trend that will like continue.Growth of larg and medium size instal in the U.S. Source:GTM Research Q2 2016 U.S. PV Leaderboard.Thi creat a coupl of problem for the larg solar installers. First, and most obvious, is that they won't be abl to grow as quickly. And when stock price were sky high, it meant they had a long way to fall. But the more import factor is that they have set fix cost like warehouses, trucks, administration, sales, and instal staff that need to be spread across a wide base. A more limit opportun for growth will make it harder to pay for those overhead costs.Instal shift to better solar equipmentOn top of the shift toward smaller installers, custom are shift toward better solar equipment. You can see in the chart below that mid-siz and long-tail instal favor higher effici and qualiti modul from manufactur like SunPower,SolarWorld, andLG,in contrast to the largest installers, which are choos lower-cost commod product from the like ofTrina SolarandREC.Smal instal are choos higher effici solar panel than their larg competitors. Imag source:GTM Research Modul Procur Trend in the U.S. Residenti Market.When custom are make decis about equipment, they gener have differ prefer than what SolarC or Vivint Solar might pick, but with nation installers, they often don't have a choic in the matter. Some custom prefer efficiency, some want higher quality, other want U.S. manufacturing, but the decis matrix is differ when it'syour home. And if you can leverag the trend from left to right in the chart abov it'll be good for business.What small instal need to surviveTh advantag small instal have in the solar industri is lower costs, in larg part becaus they don't need to have the same capabl as their larger peers. A small shop with two or three instal crew isn't go to invest the capit to build out map technolog to price specif instal or custom design rack components. They'r go to lean on supplier for mani of those products.Ironically, Sunrun wa onc a lead technolog and financ supplier to medium and small instal around the country, allow them to offer leas financ and easili quot project on the fli -- capabl that small shop might otherwis not have. Thi strategi didn't requir Sunrun to build out a riski nation infrastructur of installers. Similarly,Clean Power Finance, who eventu becam financierSpruce, had a similar strategi in the solar industry. These are valuabl offer given trend today, but that wasn't alway the case.F year ago, Sunrun and Spruce were bet that region and local instal were the futur of residenti solar, and today, it appear they were right. But if you look at the market in 2014 or 2015, it look like the nation compani were win out. Sunrun decid it need to get into the actual instal busi to keep up with the SolarC and Vivint of the world. They were chase growth, not allow the market to come to them -- which wa the biggest mistake, long term.Follow the pack come back to bite SunrunIn 2016, the home solar power market shift away from leas to loan and from large, nation instal toward smaller companies, and big residenti solar stock took a bath as a result. Where it look like SolarC (now own by Tesla) and Vivint Solar had the right strategy, which Sunrun followed, their leadership advantag were just a temporari phenomenon that prevail until more competit market driven by small instal emerged. Sunrun could have been a leader in today' market, but now it' stuck with the infrastructur of Tesla or Vivint without the benefit of a compani serv small installers.Sometimes, compani can have the right strategi but be too earli to the market. That appear to be what happen to Sunrun, which wa offer the servic that small and mid-siz instal need today, but went off track chase the growth it competitor had by get into the instal business.Today, nation solar compani are struggling, and Sunrun is chase the market withhigh cost than competitorsand fewer capabl than a compani like Tesla (think energi storage). If they'd stuck with their previou strategi of provid technolog and financ to instal rather than tri to beat Tesla and Vivint Solar at their own games, they could have been a great stock for 2017. Now, chase growth is come back to bite them -- and the larg residenti solar installers, too.10 stock we like better than SunrunWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

In the meantime, we'r see interest trend in some of the industry' most import market and from it most visibl companies.

Most notabl is the shift of power over the last few year from Europ to China.

Subsidi have larg dri up and now solar custom are compet on cost, which isn't terribl easi in some of Europe' less sunni countries.China, on the other hand, is booming, with around 30 GW of solar instal in 2016, so the countri is tri to find way to slow growth. It cut feed-in tariff rate by 19% to start thi year and is go to test a certif program start in July. It' not clear exactli how the program will work except that a MWh of renew energi product will be worth a certificate, which will then be compens by the govern in lieu of other subsidies.A Europ becom less import to the global solar industry, China becom more so, so get subsidi right will be key for both region in the long term.SolarC is on it way outTesla Motor offici chang it name to Tesla thi week, and the compani will soon phase out the SolarC name altogether. SolarC wa instrument in bring solar to hundr of thousand of people, but Musk' dream of a vertic integr renew energi compani under one brand need to be under the Tesla name.Th most notabl upcom chang will be Tesla' market of the solar roof, which will directli tie Tesla' futur to solar manufactur and installation.

"Tesla, Inc. Earnings: Model 3 to Come Into Focus",2/3/2017,"Electric-car companyTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) just schedul it fourth-quart earn release. The compani will post result for the fourth quarter on Wednesday, Feb. 22, close out a year of rapid vehicl sale growth, and mark the first report quarter with the November-acquir SolarC under it ownership.Ahead of Tesla' financi results, here' some background on key area to watch when the compani updat investors.Model 3. Imag source: Tesla Motors.makeArticleAd();Th most import question: Is the Model 3 launch on track?For Tesla, thi will be a critic year. In 2017, the compani importantli plan to launch it first mass-market vehicle: Model 3. The big question, therefore, is whether Tesla' Model 3 is still ""on plan for volum deliveri in the second half of 2017,"" as Tesla said in it third-quart update.To put the import of Model 3 into context, consid that Tesla expect Model 3 to help the compani build 500,000 total vehicl in 2018, up from Tesla' current annual run-rat of 100,000 units. In other words, Tesla like anticip Model 3 product to come close to 400,000 unit in 2018. Assum the vehicle, which ha a start price of $35,000, sell for an averag price of $43,000, thi would put annual Model 3 revenu at about $17 billion onc product hit these levels. Indeed, even Tesla CEO Elon Musk ha said he expect Model 3 to evolv into a $20 billion program, gener $5 billion in gross profit for the compani on a 25% gross profit margin.In Tesla' third-quart update, the automak said the compani had complet product line layout for Model 3 and wa prepar to begin the instal of new bodi weld and final assembl line for the vehicle.""A refin of the Model 3 continues, we remain on plan for our timing, volume, vehicl capability, pricing, and margin targets,"" Tesla said. More recently, the compani also said it expect to begin cell product for the Model 3 in the second quarter of 2017.Big spend ahead of Model 3Increas product from an annual run-rat of 100,000 unit to 500,000 unit in 2018 is go to requir some signific step-up in expens and capit outlays.Tesla car factory.

In past fourth-quart updates, Tesla usual opt to provid a full-year outlook for it vehicl deliveries.Model 3. Imag source: Tesla Motors.It' difficult to anticip what manag expect from vehicl deliveri in 2017. But guidanc will like repres a veri wide rang given the uncertainti surround the time of a sharp ramp-up in Model 3 deliveries. However, consid Tesla ha consist increas deliveri at about 50% annually, investor should at least look for anoth year of 50% growth. Thi would peg 2017 deliveri at about 114,000. Of course, if Tesla' Model 3 product ramp-up goe as the compani hope it will, Tesla could deliv as mani as 200,000 vehicles.I'd say it' safe to expect full-year guidanc for deliveri in the rang of 115,000 and 200,000 units.Model 3 will obvious be the prime item for investor to keep an eye on when Tesla report results.

Sure, hi compani is a leader in electr vehicl and residenti solar, but in the world of automak and solar energi more broadly, Tesla is a veri small player.Energi storag is anoth matter: Tesla ha been more aggress in that space, and could take a leadership posit veri quickly. And it product could veri well upend the electr market as we know it.Imag source: Tesla.makeArticleAd();Energi storag save natur ga from itselfTh futur of energi can be seen in the emerg energi storag system built in Southern California after the Aliso Canyon natur ga storag field' massiv leak late in 2015.

But there wa the potenti for a dispar dure even hours, when peopl get home and turn on their lights, that demand could exceed supply. And that wa a concern for the grid operators.Their solut wa to instal a larg array of batteri that could store energi when it wa abund and easili deploy it to the grid when needed.Sempra Energy's(NYSE: SRE) San Diego Ga & Electr contract with Tesla, Greensmith Energy, and AE Energi Storag to build 70 MW of energi storag with 280 MWh of capac to offset the Aliso Canyon outage.

I might trade it on either side, but the risk of own the actual stock is too ridicul to even contemplate.That' not to say, however, that Tesla stock can't maintain it valuat in a market that doesn't care about valuation.Th question is whether or not, over the long term, TSLA fall in line with it true valu (which is far lower), or if someth happen that result in the stock vanish off the market in an acquisition.5 Stock to Buy to Defi a Weak FebruaryWhich bring me toVolkswagen AG (ADR)(OTCMKTS:VLKAY).VLKAY is in a veri unhappi place right now.

Not onli that, it is actual conceivable.Th first problem would be to come up with $30 billion-$40 billion in cash and/or stock to buy TSLA. For most companies, that would be pretti laughable. Yet Volkswagen is not most companies, becaus about a sixth of it is own by theQatar Invest Authority, and about 13% is own by the State of Lower Saxony.Who better to buy out a government-subsid compani that a govern subsid company? Together, these entiti also control about 37% of thevot rights.

Google Earnings: The Market Has Made The Same Mistake Twice,2/2/2017,"Googl Earn (Shutterstock photo)A a gener rule, the market is pretti good about learn from it mistakes. After all, there is noth like a hefti loss to teach trader what not to do.That is a simpl fact that must be born in mind when look for pattern in pricing; if the pattern involv a reaction to news that wa ultim proven wrong, it is unlik to repeat veri often, and the few opportun when it doe should be grab with both hands.makeArticleAd();That is what make Googl parent compani Alphabet (GOOG:GOOGL) look like such a good buy after it reaction to Q4 earnings.A you can see from the chart below, prior to last week’ earn report Googl (I’m sorri but I just can’t bring myself to call the compani “Alphabet”) had drop sharpli on earn miss contain in two of the previou three releases, in April and October.On both of those occasions, though, the big drop in price was, with the benefit of 20/20 hindsight, an opportun to buy the stock at a discount. There are differ circumst thi time around, of course, but the dynam that ha made neg reaction to earn in the past opportun is still in place, so the end result is like to be the same.Th biggest problem with the Q4 result as far as trader were concerned, it seems, were that cost per click wa down, and oper cost had risen to the point where earn per Class A share (EPS) of $9.36 fell short of the Street’ estim of around $9.64. Still, revenu of $26.06 billion beat the estim $25.26 billion.Ther wa also a concern lurk in the background regard Googl take on both Amazon (AMZN)’ Echo and Appl (AAPL)’ iPhon with recent hardwar launches. Googl said that they were pleas with the reaction to both Googl Home and the Pixel phone without go into specifics, but doubt about the wisdom of the strategi persist.I actual believ that Googl ha a chanc of limit success in each case. The Pixel will be the most uphil struggl as the iPhone’ domin of the mobil phone market is well established. Most estim of sale of the phone so far are around 1 million, which hardli put a dent in the iPhone, but may prove to be enough of a base to make the Pixel profit as a nich product.Hom ha an easier, more logic path to success as Googl is the natur choic of those look for what is, essentially, a free-stand search engine.Ultimately, though, neither Home nor Pixel is go to be the driver of the recoveri in the stock price that histori suggest will come soon.First, the increas in oper cost that Googl report seems, on a breakdown of the numbers, to be the result of invest in the core business. Loss in what the compani call “Other Bets,” thing like “Nest” and self drive cars, were actual reduc somewhat in the fourth quarter, but there wa signific progress on the autonom vehicl front.Th possibl of that field are endless and Google, along with Tesla (TSLA) and Apple, are gener seen as the leader in driverless car research and technology.Th other issue, of fall cost per click (CPC), is also not what it seem on the surface. It reflect a continu move to mobil that result in that metric falling, but the volum of click increasing. The same issu was, in part, respons for the April and Octob drop in GOOG after earnings, and the chart tell the stori of how long it wa until investor realiz that volum more than offset fall CPC.Look at Google’ result and the market reaction to them, I get a sens of déjà vu. We have actual been here before, twice, and each time the drop in GOOG gave investor a chanc to buy cheaply. It seem that in thi case the market is still learn from it mistak and over time the outcom here is most like to be the same."
2 Things NVIDIA Corporation Needs to Prove in 2017,2/2/2017,"NVIDIA Corporation's(NASDAQ: NVDA) stock price skyrocket 229% in 2016 and ha left investor wonder if there' more room for the compani to grow thi year.NVIDIA ha built out a domin posit in the graphic process unit (GPU) market for desktop and laptop computers, but investor are also look to new growth area like automot and virtual realiti for NVIDIA' future.Imag source: NVIDIA.makeArticleAd();Thi may never measur up to NVIDIA' stellar perform last year, but there are two thing that the compani will need to prove in 2017 in order to keep momentum going: continu to grow revenu at a solid clip, and show that invest in new market segment are pay off.Keep the revenu growth goingEveri investor like a good earn beat, and NVIDIA deliv on that multipl last year. NVIDIA doesn't necessarili need to beat estim in order to continu perform well in 2017, though. Investor should look instead for the compani to deliv on it quarterli guidanc and grow it core GPU game business.NVIDIA' manag expect revenu of $2.1 billion (plu or minu 2%) in fiscal Q4 2017, which is in line with analysts' consensus. NVIDIA ha manag to beat analyst estim for at least the past four quarters, and it could do the same in Q4, but investor should be more focus on how the compani perform in thelucr game segment.NVIDIA domin the desktop GPU market, with more than 70.9% market share right now, and it should be abl to use that posit to sustain grow revenu and earn through 2017.NVIDIA brought in 62% of it top-lin revenu from it game segment in fiscal Q3 2017, mark a 35% year-over-year increase. The compani need to prove that it can keep grow it all-import game segment revenu -- overal earn -- in order to justifi it increasingli high price-to-earn ratio of 71 (compar to the tech industri averag of around 25).Tap into new marketsWhil the company' game revenu are the most import for investor to watch, NVIDIA will also need to prove that it invest in virtual realiti (VR) and the automot market are pay off.VR is expect to reach a market size of $70 billion by 2020 and have 171 million activ user worldwid by next year. NVIDIA' GPU market share posit mean it should have no problem benefit from thi grow tech segment. But investor will need to see the company' graphic card earn more spot in VR-readi computers.Additionally, NVIDIA ha to prove that it can continu expand it automot ambitions. Investor got excit last year about the possibl NVIDIA'ssemi-autonom drive technologieswil bring, and they should expect to see more partnership and revenu come from that in 2017.In fiscal Q3 2017, the compani grew automot revenu by more than 60% year over year, and a new partnership withTeslashould help the companyexpand it positioneven further thi year thi year.Good time are like still aheadNVIDIA like ha more room to grow in 2017, particularli with the company' core game busi chug along so well right now. But investors' expect are alreadi sky high after NVIDIA' run-up in 2016. If the compani doesn't show that it can grow revenu at the same pace (or close to it) and continu expand into new segments, some investor may lose confidence.If that happens, rememb to look to NVIDIA' core game business. As long as everyth appear in tact there, NVIDIA should continu to grow over the long term. The company' stock run-up won't last forever, but that doesn't mean thi compani won't be a solid long-term invest if it continu to prove it can domin the graphic card market and enter new market at the same time.10 stock we like better than NvidiaWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Why Investors Should Listen When General Motors Talks About Self-Driving Cars,1/29/2017,"Mani investor think that autonom vehicl (AVs), or ""self-driv cars,"" will transform the landscap of the tradit auto business. While I think it' prematur to pick winner and losers, it seem clear that at least some of the winner will come from outsid of the tradit auto industri network.Some, but not all. One century-old Rust Belt giant is increasingli confid that it will be among the winner as self-driv technolog goe mainstream -- and if you'v followedGener Motors(NYSE: GM) under CEO Mari Barra, you know that when GM talk about technology, it' worth pay close attention.Whi GM think it will be a self-driv leaderEarli thi month, GM Presid Dan Ammann explain whi the General' manag team think GM is well-posit to lead in the come era of self-driv vehicles: ""We have been veri consistent, I think, in our extern messag on autonom vehicl and ride-shar and what we see the opportun to be. We think thi could be a very, veri large, address market, in autonom and ride-shar at scale, and we believ that we have assembl all of the piec that we need to lead in thi area.""makeArticleAd();Thi slide from Ammann' present show those ""pieces"" as GM see them.Imag source: Gener Motors.Most tech-ori investor probabl don't think of GM as a leader when it come to vehicl connectivity. But most of us have seen those OnStar button that GM ha been instal in it vehicl for 20 year now. Put two and two together: GM ha taken the OnStar technolog and connect platform -- and the lesson it ha learn over the last two decad -- and is transform it into a comprehens platform for the connect vehicl of the not-very-dist future.A for GM' vehicl platform, the photo say it all. Ammann:W believ we have the right vehicl platform for AV. We think the onli long-term sustain path for autonom vehicl is fulli electric. And we'r obvious in a leadership posit with the Bolt. All of our AV develop that' go on is base on the Bolt platform.Th all-electr Bolt is alreadi in mass product at GM' factori in Orion, Michigan. That factori ha plenti of capac to ramp up, if and when demand for the littl electr crossov increases. ""Manufactur capability"" is a big challeng for new industri entrants, but it obvious isn't go to be an issu for an auto-manufactur giant like GM.A Chevi Bolt with a prototyp self-driv system test near GM' technic center in Warren, Michigan. Imag source: Gener Motors.A for network, that wa a key to GM' invest in ride-hail start-up Lyft, as Ammann explained: ""And then on the network, we have our allianc with Lyft, that' one year old now. And we think it' been veri success in term of both the short-term opportun we'v been pursu in relat to Express Drive, but also, obviously, the ultim goal here of deploy autonom vehicl into a share network.""But doe GM realli have it own self-driv technology? How can an old Detroit compani keep up with Silicon Valley? Part of the answer is that GM bought a San Francisco-bas self-driv start-up, Cruis Automation, last year. Here' the rest, per Ammann:So what I'd like to do now is just give you a littl bit of perspect on where we are technology-wis here. Over the last 12 months, particularli through most of 2016, there' been a lot of hype around AV and new busi model and so on, and all kind of nois and perspect out there. And frankly, what we'v been do as a company, we'v been realli sort of working. We'v been work in the background. But we thought it wa time to give you a littl bit of perspect on where we'r at.So ani time ani of us from the leadership team are out on the west coast, we stop by to see the Cruis team and typically, we'll take a ride and join one of the develop ride in the car and see how the technolog is evolving. And what I'm go to show you is a video of a ride that I went on.Amman explain that thi video is from a ""regular develop ride,"" not a special ride done just for the video. It' sped up, but it includ all 22 minut of the ride that Ammann took, in the back seat of thi vehicl as the video wa filming.""Twenty-two minutes, fulli autonomous, zero driver takeovers, zero driver intervention,"" Ammann said. ""The whole ride wa entir control from the Cruis mobil app.""""So there you go. It' real,"" he said. ""From a technolog point of view, we think a ton of progress ha been made. There' still a lot of work to do, safety, integr and so on. But this, hopefully, give you a flavor for how quickli we think thi is move along.""Th takeaway: It' a mistak to overlook Gener Motors' tech right nowHere' the takeaway as I see it for investor interest in self-driv car and the intersect of technolog and autos.A lot of tech-mind investors, analysts, and pundit didn't take GM serious when it first roll out the concept version of the Chevi Bolt two year ago. How could hidebound old GM hope to compet withTesla Motorsand other Silicon Valley darlings, they asked.Fast-forward to today: The Bolt is shipping, and real-world test ha shown that it exce the target GM announc when it show that concept Bolt in earli 2015.That' one of mani area in which GM ha deliv on expect set by Barra, Ammann, and the other member of the General' manag team over the last few years.

3 Self-Driving-Car Facts You Need to Know,1/29/2017,"Driverless-car stock could be gear up for their best year yet. But beyond compani fundamentals, there are regulatori reason to be worri about the futur of autonom vehicles. Here are three thing you need to know befor you turn the key on driverless-car stocks.Imag source: Waymo (Alphabet)makeArticleAd();1. Driverless car have killed,but they may be safer than humans.Last May, the driverless-car dream turn into a nightmare. ATesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) Model S owner had Autopilot engag on a highway when a truck drove across it path. Neither Autopilot nor the driver notic the trailer becaus of it white color against a sunni sky, result in the first record death result in part from a driverless-car technolog failure.Whil thi tragic crash ha rightli attract the attent of regulators, investors, and concern citizens, it' import to put thi occurr into perspective. Everi year, 35,000 driver and passeng die on America' road -- that' equival to one death everi 15 minutes, and 94% of those are caus by human error. Given driverless cars' overal track record, the safeti comparison between human- and computer-driven car clearli point to an autom advantage.Thes sort of empir analys are import for investor and can be even more essenti when alarm news (such as a car crash) emerg that might caus a short-term stock price swing. On the first trade day after news of the crash wa announced, Tesla Motor stock drop 4%, but it bounc back up for a 2% overal increas by the end of the day. Steadi investor can ignor the swing and focu on statist instead.2. Not all self-driv car are creat equalImag source: Getti Images.Th Nation Highway Traffic Safeti Administr ha defin a five-level continuum to determin how self-driv a car realli is. At Level 0, the human driver doe everything. At Level 4, the human doe nothing. Self-driving-car stock have taken differ approach to decid just how driverless they want their car to be, but most have come to the conclus that semi-driverless car can actual be the most dangerous. That' becaus between level 0 and 4, human might have to take over when someth goe wrong -- and human are gener terribl at react quickli and safely. That' whi compani that aren't innov beyond assist autom may soon be left behind.Thos that are go for full automation, such asFord,Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) , and Volvo, may be the one that ultim becom market leaders, even if their technolog isn't current widespread. In thi case, investor should make sure to not err on the side of pick semi-driverless model over autonom prototypes. For example, Alphabet' stand-alon compani Waymo, which doesn't have a steer wheel and is still consid by most to be a prototype, may actual be a better invest than ""proven"" lane-departur warn systems, readili avail on almost all high-end vehicles.3. Self-driving-car compani want to be regulated.Imag source: Getti Images.Compani are often at odd with regulators, spend billion of dollar on lobbi to ensur politician steer clear of market meddling. Ford, Alphabet, Lyft, Uber, and Volvo Car are take an opposit approach. Last April, they establish the ""Self-Driv Coalit for Safer Streets"" to ""work with lawmakers, regulators, and the public to realiz the safeti and societ benefit of self-driv vehicles."" Last month, the group' legal counsel pen an op- inTh Hillcal for a ""singl nation framework"" to align the country' regul and cut down on conflict local law and regul that could bring driverless-car innov to a standstill. For an industri as emerg as driverless cars, thi serv as a smart remind that investor shouldn't consid regul to be evil -- rule are import and can enabl the most innov compani to push ahead with production.Th road aheadSelf-driving-car stock are hot, and in 2017 they may attract more attent than ever before. Investor who know the fact and stick with the stat are like to come out ahead, so be sure to keep these three point in mind when make your next self-driving-car stock pick.10 stock we like better than Wal-MartWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

3 Car Models That Could Get the Ax This Year,1/29/2017,"Which car model are like to get the ax over the next year or so?Sometimes, when an automak plan to discontinu a model, the compani make it obviou by announc it -- or by drop a strong hint: ""We'r close the factori that make it."" But other times, it take some analysi to figur out which of today' car model are fate to go the way of the Edsel and Oldsmobile.Her are three model our car-mind Foolish specialist think will disappear in the next year or so.makeArticleAd();Th littl car that couldn'tDaniel Miller(Chevrolet Sonic):On vehicl that could be on the chop block sooner rather than later isGener Motors'(NYSE: GM) Chevrolet Sonic. It' noth against the Sonic itself, per se, but the fact is, demand for smaller vehicl is plummet while both demand for larger vehicl and a push toward electrifi vehicl are accelerating.Th littl Chevi Sonic could be cut to make room for new electr cars. Imag source: Gener Motors.Sal of the Chevi Sonic were down nearli 15% in 2016, and it remain one of the brand' lowest-volum vehicles. Furthermore, 2016 wa the vehicle' worst full year of sales, with onli 55,255 vehicl sold; that' down from it 93,518 peak in 2014 and far below the mid-80,000 sold in 2012 and 2013, it first two full year on the market.Not onli that, but as automak continu to push toward electrifi lineups, it' worth note that the Sonic is produc at the Orion Assembl plant that recent receiv a $160 million invest to produc the Chevrolet Bolt EV -- and one could assum that the plant could be the futur product locat of GM' next EV project.Th Sonic' segment is fall out of favor with the U.S. consumer, and thank to Presid Donald Trump' tweet flurry, it' less like that product will be salvag with a move to Mexico. That mean the Sonic is like on the chop block after onli it first model, and it product capac could be replac by a forward-think electr vehicl to be produc alongsid the Bolt.Th electr car that got left behindTravi Hoium(Nissan LEAF):I'l take the angl of model thatshouldget the ax in 2017. And my pick is theNissan(NASDAQOTH: NSANY) LEAF.On of the veri clear trend take place in the EV industri is a move toward long-rang full-electr vehicl or plug-in hybrid drivetrains. Accord toInsideEVs,Tesla Motors'(NASDAQ: TSLA) Model S and Model X are No. 1 and No. 3 in the categori in sale in the U.S., with GM' plug-in hybrid Chevi Volt take the No. 2 spot.Sal of Nissan' LEAF have fallen as competitor have introduc more advanc electr models. Imag source: Nissan Motor Co., Ltd.Fall behind is the Nissan LEAF, which sold 14,006 unit in 2016, down from 17,269 in 2015 and 30,200 in 2014. Put anoth way, EV sale were up 30% between 2014 and 2016, and Nissan LEAF sale fell 54% over the same time frame. What Nissan is offer is not what the market is buying.Nissan know it need to increas rang beyond the 107 mile the LEAF can current travel on a charge. But industri report have the unconfirm base 2018 Nissan LEAF pack just 120 mile of range, and upgrad onli push it to about 200 miles. With Tesla' vehicl alreadi push a high-end rang of over 300 miles, the LEAF is look ancient. Add in the fact that the Chevi Bolt is in dealership and ha a 238-mile range, and that Tesla' Model 3 is expect mid-year with over 200 mile of range, and the competit is run lap around Nissan.Nissan wa one of the earliest mover in EVs, but the compani hasn't adapt to the market' desir for more range. And I'm afraid the LEAF is perman brand as a low-range, uninspir EV that need to be scrap to make room for a well-thought-out EV that can compet with the next gener of competitors.An icon car that American no longer seem to wantJohn Rosevear(Ford Taurus):It wa onc the best-sel car in America. It namepl wa famous reviv by Alan Mulal in one of hi first act after becom CEO in 2006. But here in 2017, it look likeFord Motor Company's(NYSE: F) once-icon Tauru is on it last leg -- at least in the Unit States.Today' Tauru is differ from the Taurus (Tauri?) that were the best-sel back in the 1990s, and it' differ in way that have hit it especi hard as buyer prefer haveswung away from sedansand toward crossov SUVs. For one thing, the current Tauru is consid a full-siz sedan, not midsize, like it predecessors. Ford' midsiz Fusion is still a strong seller, but sale of the Taurus, like those of most of it full-siz rivals, have slump in a big way. Ford sold just 34,626 Taurus in the U.S. last year, down over 11%. (Bi contrast, it sold 265,840 Fusions.)Onc America' best-sel car, the Ford Tauru now appear head for retirement. Imag source: Ford Motor Company.It' not just about the slump market segment, though. The design of the current Tauru ha some drawbacks. Notably, it back seat is more cramp than you'd expect in a car of it size. That wasn't consid a big deal when it wa all-new way back in 2010, but it' a big deal now that cushi back seat have becom an import sell point for big (and midsize) sedans. (That back seat, by the way, is a big reason Ford ha struggl to sell the Tauru as a polic car: Cop say that get handcuf suspect into the back seat can be awkward, especi if the arreste is struggling.)Ford could fix those drawback with an all-new Taurus. In fact, it did: Fordlaunch an all-new Tauru for 2016that share it architectur with the new Lincoln Continental. But Ford is onli build it in China, where larg sedan are still popular. There are appar no plan to start build it for the U.S. market.Th all-new Tauru that Ford build and sell in China. Imag source: Ford Motor Company.It'spossibleFord could import some exampl of the Chinese-mad Tauru to replac the current model for those custom who still want a big Ford sedan.

The Biggest Investment Opportunity Of Our Lifetime,1/28/2017,"Everi hour of everi day, enough solar energi reach earth to replac all energi consum in a year combined. Everi drop of oil, everi piec of coal, and everi cubic foot of natur gas; trillion of dollar of econom valu hit the earth everi hour.If we could captur just a small percentage, a measli 0.03% of the solar energi hit the world each year, we could be use clean, home-grown energy, not onli in the U.S., but around the world. And the compani that can exploit thi resourc have the chanc to upend a multi-trillion dollar industry, someth so revolutionari it may onli happen onc everi few generations. And it creat the biggest invest opportun I think we'll see in ani of our lifetimes.makeArticleAd();Imag source: Getti Images.Th power of solar energyIt' hard to state just how big the potenti for renew energi -- and solar energi in particular -- is around the world. And if the polit will is there it would be easi to make an incred larg impact on the energi industri over the next decade. Today, wind and solar power are both cheaper than electr from new fossil fuel plants, and there' an abund of land in little-util locat like deserts, open fields, and ocean where renew power could be generated. For the solar industry, energi product can even be put on rooftop that are otherwis un-util around the world.We'r alreadi see how cost effect solar energi is in countri around the world.TeslaMotors'(NASDAQ: TSLA) solar divis SolarC is built on sell rooftop solar as a cost save tool for customers.First Solar(NASDAQ: FSLR) andSunPower(NASDAQ: SPWR) are bid on energi contract around the world that compet directli with fossil fuels. And with bid now below 4 cent per kWh, they'r win over tradit energi sources.From a cost basis, solar energi is now competitive, that much is clear. And solar energi is such a small percentag of energi production, provid 1% of electr demand in 2016, that it ha a lot of growth ahead.A multi-trillion dollar opportunityI think it' import to dive into the number a littl bit to show just how big the opportun is for solar energy, so thi next section may get a littl weedsy.Th U.S. Energi Inform Administr estim that global energi consumpt will pass 600 quadrillion BTU befor 2020, or in electr term 175.8 billion MWh.To show the upsid potenti for solar energy, let' look at how much solar power product there would have to be to meet 100% of the energi market' demands. If a solar power plant can gener it full namepl capac 25% of the time, known as the capac factor, there would need to be 80,274 GW of solar power product instal around the world.In 2016, global solar instal were around 70 GW, and cumul instal global are now about 300 GW installed, a tini fraction of energi consumpt worldwide.To illustr the potenti solar power could have, if we assum we want to get all of our energi from solar and a solar power plant last 30 years, you would have to instal 2,676 GW everi year to transit the world to solar energy. To accomplish this, the global solar industri would have to grow 35x from it size in 2016. Put anoth way, the solar industri could grow instal 30% everi singl year and it would still take nearli 14 year to reach a rate of 2,676 GW per year. And that figur doesn't even assum ani growth.Bi 2040, the IEA predict annual energi consumpt will be 815 quadrillion BTUs. To fill that gap between 815 quadrillion BTU and the 600 quadrillion BTU figur I use to calcul the figur abov a total of 28,800 GW of solar energi would need to be installed, or about 410x what wa instal in 2016.It may sound absurd that solar energi could provid all of our energi needs, but it may not be all that crazy. Nearli half of the world' energi consumpt is electricity, and the major use of oil -- transport -- is start to be disrupt by electr vehicles.Cheap and abund solar could provid a greater percentag of energi need as the world electrifi and transit away from fossil fuels. The opportun for solar is worth trillion of dollars, a huge chanc for the compani who grab ani signific part of the market.Whi solar profit will go up as the industri growsI'v laid out how incred big the solar industry' potenti is, but right now it may be hard to draw a line from the hyper competit industri we see today to a profit growth industry. But thi is where the dynam are changing.Solar energi bid have long struggl to be competit with fossil fuel and compani have had to fight each other to win contracts. Combin that with rapid cost reduct and you have manufactur and develop kill each other just to gain market share.But we'r get to the point where solar energi is start to compet with exist energi sources, open up bigger market without the same price competition. And as solar energi pass coal, nuclear, and natur ga on the cost curv it doesn't have to lower bid price as quickli to maintain competitive. Thi should allow develop and manufactur to slowli expand margin as they cut costs.When you add in new innov like short and long-term energi storag and it' possibl that solar power plant will be built to provid a base load sourc of electr to the grid, someth that' onli been dream about in the renew industri until recently.Whi the invest opportun is so bigHopefully, it' easi to see whi the growth opportun is enormous, both from a volum of instal perspect and also from a dollar perspective. As solar energi beat the cost of coal, natur gas, and oil as an energi source, it would make sens that the profit and valu of solar compani would go up. But the market hasn't display that potenti yet.Th chart below show the market cap of three of the largest solar compani in the world, First Solar,Canadian Solar(NASDAQ: CSIQ) , and SunPower, compar toExxonMobilandRoy Dutch Shell. You can see the oil giant are worth over 100x more than the solar companies.FSLR Market Capdata byYChartsIf we ballpark solar energi from a revenu perspective, the opportun is equal impressive. Bloomberg New Energi Financ estim that $287 billion wa invest in all of clean energi in 2016, includ wind, solar, hydro, and other sources. If the 2,676 GW invest figur I outlin abov end up be true and solar instal cost are $0.80 per watt (about a 30% reduct from today) the total valu of instal alon would be about $2.1 trillion.It' imposs to predict how much solar stock will rise over the next few decades, but the opportun for the industri is easili in the trillion of dollar annually. I think it' clear that solar energi is the biggest invest opportun of our lifetimes. Bigger than computers, bigger than the internet, solar energi could chang the world forever. And the compani that can take a signific amount of market share could becom the new energi giants, replac the oil giant we know today.10 stock we like better than Wal-MartWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Net Metering Is Under Attack: Here's What You Need to Know,1/28/2017,"Util across the countri are tri to find way to undermin rooftop solar, and some state are give them some help. Thi month alone, Wyoming'slegislatur introduc a billthat would effect ban both wind and solar in the state, includ rooftop solar. Indiana' legislatur is alsoconsid a billthat would forc rooftop solar owner to sell all of their energi product to the util while buy all of their energi from the utility.It' not yet clear whether either bill will go forward, but it' clear that util and some state are move to a more adversari stanc with solar energy. And sinc state-wid polici that pass tend to use as model for implement in other states, continu regul of solar could be in the offing. That could impact solar compani in a dramat way.Solar panels. Imag source: Getti Images.makeArticleAd();Th rooftop solar industri is under attackNet meter ha long been the foundat of rooftop solar econom in the U.S. A custom with solar could put solar panel on their roof and use ani electr they could, but ani excess would be sent to the grid. When their monthli bill arrived, they would onli pay for their net electr usage, mean solar energi export to the grid would effect be paid the retail rate. Mani util argu that net meter doesn't compens them fairli for run the grid, but rule to adopt a fairer structur aren't usual as draconian as ban rooftop solar altogether.Th three compani that would be the most at risk in the attack on rooftop solar will beTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) ,Vivint Solar(NYSE: VSLR) , andSunrun(NASDAQ: RUN) . Tesla isn't 100% reliant on rooftop solar after it bought SolarCity, but Vivint Solar and Sunrun are. If these attack are successful, they could be in trouble.Rooftop solar demand wa alreadi fairli weak in 2016, lead to all rooftop solar compani to cut back on instal growth projections. At thi point, it' unlik there will be much instal growth at all in late 2016 and earli 2017. That' whi ani pressur on demand will be a negative, even if it start in state like Indiana and Wyoming, which have veri littl solar.Whi util will fail at undermin solarWhat' interest about the attack on solar is that it'll onli delay the inevitable. Rooftop solar energi is now cost effect in most of the countri if net meter is in place, which is whi util are tri to add fee or undercut net meter rates. But as fees, like demand charg or fix charges, go up, it will drive custom to solar + storage, which util can't control as easily.A the cost of solar and batteri come down, it will eventu be econom to gener electr on your rooftop, store ani excess creat dure the day, and then use store energi at night. Thi wouldn't requir ani energi export to the grid, mean the util would have few method for punish custom who choos to go solar. If they did, custom may eventu find it econom to cut the grid altogether.Tesla is clearli lead the way into solar + storag with the Powerwall, an energi storag system with an invert included. But Sunrun and Vivint Solar are start to add their own solar + storag offer as well. Call it insur for the inevit attack they'll face from util afraid of lose their customers. The attack may be reach a fever pitch and investor will want to watch the develop in test state like Indiana and Wyom closely.10 stock we like better than Wal-MartWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Why General Electric Company (GE) Stock Has a History of Winning,1/27/2017,"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsMay I be frank with you?Gener Electr Company(NYSE:GE) is a bit of a bore, and that' put it mildly.

Thi week, theDow Jone Industri Averagehit20,000 pointsfor the first time in history.Not onli is Gener Electr a compon of the Dow 30, it wa a strong contributor to the record. GE stock turn in a 1.23% perform against it prior session. The averag gain for the Dow-list compani on the record-break day wa onli 0.6%, which is surprisingli low.In fact, there were onli six compani that post better number than GE, and these were the usual suspects. In increas order, they wereIntern Busi Machin Corp. (NYSE:IBM),Goldman Sach Group Inc(NYSE:GS),JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM),Appl Inc.

Presid Donald Trump ha promis fewer regul stymi business, more support for the militari industri complex and keep job stateside. Gener Electr belong among the titan of American industry; hence, yesterday' robust gains.10 High-Yield Dividend Stock That Are SOMEHOW Still BargainsBut is the recent surg of GE stock base on optim for Presid Trump, or a reaction from pronounc volatility? The answer to that question is critic for investors.G Stock Is Exciting, and That' Bad!G ha shed it bore image, but for all the wrong reasons.Click to EnlargeWhil it' veri earli into the new year, nevertheless, it' worth point out that share are down 4%. I should also mention that at thi price point, GE stock is firmli below it 50-day move average, and onli a hair abov it 200-DMA.I don't think the volatil should be ignor as a bunch of technic mumbo jumbo. Just a few day ago, Gener Electr share were down 6%.More worryingly, trader haven't push the needl that far sinc GE falter under the weight of an uninspir and anem fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 earn results.Rightfully, peopl are concerned. True, GE stock is a reliabl investment, make steadi gain through all sort of econom cycles. At the same time, it stabl natur can work against the investor if there' a sharp downfall. It may take an inordin amount of time for Gener Electr to gain 10%, but it could be gone in a flash. As an example, GE return 6% last year - and we'v basic burn through two-third of that profit.I don't care how high the dividend yield are for Gener Electric. No one can afford to lose that much capit and justifi the loss due to the passiv income. Unless GE stock wa offer doubl digits, it' a bad deal. Of course, the question would then become, whi are they offer doubl digits?Just Stay the Cours With Gener ElectricSo should potenti buyer heed the warning? Absolutely, they should! GE stock ha form an ""insid day"" pattern against the loss incur by the feebl earn report. Unless share can quickli fill the technic gap, momentum definit lean bearishly. Attempt to catch a fall knife here would not be the greatest idea.Asia Will Take Over the World, and Facebook Inc (FB) Want InThat said, the month of Januari is GE stock'skryptonite. The last three Januari produc a shockingli bad loss of 6%. Sinc 1962, Gener Electr ha averag onli 0.8% return for the open month of the calendar. In nomin terms, there were onli 28 posit Januari over that time frame. That mean that GE stock is as use as a coin toss dure the NFL playoffs.However, the industri titan is a consist winner over the long run. By the end of the year, GE stock is good for an averag 13% return. Nominally, 39 year end sunni side up. Thi current decad ha been particularli robust, averag over 15%.I'v made thi argument before, but it realli come down to your end goal. If you'r look for a hot growth stock, look elsewhere, please! If you want to bide your time and not rock your portfolio with risk, GE stock is a prudent choice.But even reliabl name have their off seasons.

Trader should keep a close eye out for news on the new gigafactori and ani delivery/product updat on the all-import Model 3.Turn to TSLA' sentiment backdrop, we find littl in the way of optimism. For instance, Thomson/First Call report that onli seven of the 21 analyst follow Tesla stock rate the share a ""buy"" or better. Furthermore, the 12-month consensu price-target of $240.94 repres a discount to the stock' current trade rang north of $250.5 Blue-Chip Stock to Sell in FebruaryElsewhere, short seller are load for bear head into next month' report.

The $269 region is home to Tesla' 2016 highs, and a breakout here could forc analyst and short seller to capitulate. Meanwhile, the lower bound lie near 10-day and 20-day trendlin support.So, how do we trade Tesla from here?2 Trade for TSLA StockPut Spread:Whil TSLA stock is on a solid run higher, I'm expect a sell-on-the-new event follow next month' earnings.

Consider This All-In-One Biotech Fund With a 10% Yield (CHI),1/26/2017,"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsWhil the invest world continu to shovel money toward exchange-trad fund (ETFs) (full disclosure: I find myself use them more and more), it' almost as if the grandfath of the ETF, the closed-end fund (CEF), ha been reduc to a memori like dial phone or the Nehru jacket. But when I'm at a loss for find valu in an individu stock, I often find myself look through CEF name like a millenni at a record shop.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');CEF can trace their origin back to the 1860 in Great Britain, when they were primarili use to rais money to build U.S. railroads. The first American CEF appear in 1893, 30 year prior to the first U.S. open-end mutual fund. Prior to the Crash of 1929, American CEF claim over $4 billion in assets, which wa big money for the time.CEF have evolv over the decad since, but their organ and basic featur have remain rel consistent. CEF are and alway have been profession and activ managed, exchange-traded, intern leveraged, and incom oriented.Recently, while screen a hand of CEFs, one piqu my interest:Calamo Convert & Hi Incom Fund(CHI).A the name suggests, most of the fund' heavi lift is done through the use of convert bonds, which are what is known as a hybrid security. Each bond is convert to a pre-determin number of share of the issuer' common stock. Thi give an investor two things: an incom stream and particip in the movement of the company' stock. Often, convert bond are issu by high-growth compani whose common stock doe not pay a dividend.Th 10 Best Stock to Buy for 2017: The Experts' PicksTh fact that the fund is manag by Calamo Invest wa the attent grabber. Found in 1977 by John Calamos, Sr., the firm becam one of the invest world' premier convert bond managers. I had the pleasur of meet Mr. Calamo at a confer a few year back.Know the fund wa manag by a true authority, I look under the hood. 37.9% of the fund, naturally, is made up of convert bond while 16.4% is convert prefer stocks.But what realli excit me wa the sector allocation.Ov 35% of the fund is weight across inform technolog and healthcare, repres by disrupt such asTesla Motor Inc(TSLA) andPricelin Group Inc(PCLN).Inde 19.2% cover the consum discretionari sector with anoth 20.3% alloc to financials, energy, industri and utilities. The fund is notic underweight in telecom, materials, real estate, and consum staples.Debut in June of 2002 as the bear market of the same year approach it bottom, CHI sport asset of over $1 billion with total intern expens of 1.25% which is high if you'r compar to a Vanguard index fund. But keep in mind, Vanguard index fund don't have dividend yield approach 11%.Risk To Consider:Lik mani CEFs, CHi use leverag to juic up yield and returns. Currently, the fund' leverag percentag is at 28.57% which isn't too terribl out of whack. However, portfolio leverag is like be lent an umbrella when it' not raining. When the raindrop fall, the lender typic want it back. Therefore, rise rate are probabl the biggest extern risk face the fund. Thi would creat volatil in both the fund' lower coupon hold and leverag position. But with the link between convert bond and equiti markets, rise stock should help offset thi risk.7 Cheap Stock to Buy That Could Doubl in 2017Action To Take:Th uniqu complexion of CHI offer conservative, income-ori investor a uniqu opportun to gain exposur to the growthiest of growth stock in a risk-manag packag with above-averag income.

3 Reasons Trump Should Worry IoT Investors,1/26/2017,"Imag source: Getti Images.Presid Trump had hi fair share ofverb scuffl with technolog companiesdur hi elect campaign. But now that' he' the president, hi stanc on feder fund for new technologies, tax credits, and hi push for more American manufactur could have ramif for mani companies, includ publicli trade one bet on the Internet of Thing (IoT).A few month ago, BI Intelligencepublish some forecastson how Trump' presid wa like to affect the growth of the Internet of Thing and the compani behind it; now that the inaugur is over, it' worth give thi inform a good look over.makeArticleAd();Here' what could change:Fund for smart citi project could dri upIn fiscal 2015, the feder govern spent $8.8 billion on IoT projects, and from fiscal 2011 through 2015, it spent a total of $35 billion for IoT infrastructure, software, and cybersecurity. One project involv an invest in smart citi that allowedAT&T(NYSE: T) bring IoT connect to 10 citi across the U.S. for lighting, transportation, parking, and safeti features.But the BI Intellig report note that smart citi project will like ""stall or be abandon due to a lack of feder support from a Trump administration."" That' becaus Trump plan for tax would reduc feder revenu by $9.5 trillion over 10 years, lead to a major spike in the nation debt and leav fund scarc for such high-tech infrastructur investments. They further note that given Republicans' refus to acknowledg climat change, program that subsid energy-effici or green technolog project -- mani of which have IoT aspect -- are like to have their fund cut or cancel outright.That' import not just for AT&T and it smart citi projects, but also for broader American IoT innovations. I'v written befor thatChina is lead the way in the IoTbecaus it govern ha commit to spend lot of money to help compani develop new technologies. If the Trump administr back away from IoT investments, expect China' lead on the U.S. to widen even further.Self-driv car innov could slowIf you'r think that Trump couldn't possibl have influenc over the autonom car revolution, consid that electric-vehicl makerTesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) ha releas some of themost advanc semi-autonom hardwareand softwar to date.Mani of Tesla' vehicl are purchas with the help of feder tax credits, but under Trump -- who doe not have a particularli fond view of environment polici -- green energi tax incent could be reduc or eliminated.Tax credit of thi type have push down the cost of current plug-in electr car like the Model S, and could help reduc the cost of the cheaper, upcom Model 3. New version of the Model S and the upcom Model 3 will have a full suit of self-driv hardwar built into them, but if that green tax credit disappears, as an analyst from AutoPacificbeliev it could, then the higher price could significantli slow the sale growth of Tesla specifically, and imped the spread of driverless car technolog in general.Autom might be less desirableA big part of the IoT involv compani use an internet connect and sensor to autom system and analyz data. In the manufactur sector,Gener Electric(NYSE: GE) use internet-connect machineri and softwar to increas plant efficiency, both in it own factori and in those of other companies.In huge plants, keep track of all the physic part use to manufactur a product can be tricky. So instead of keep the chaotic and cost-prohibit old system (where peopl would run around a plant tri to track down parts) GE creat it Work in Process Manag -- power by it Predix softwar -- that automat track manufacturing. The compani say that the system allow supervisor to ""immedi know where ani part or compon are in the plant.""Trump want to increas the number of manufactur job in the U.S. which isn't a bad thing. But that could lead to him attempt to put pressur on manufactur compani to keep peopl employ in job that could instead be autom with IoT tech like GE ha developed. If compani fear that use IoT system to becom more effici will put them in conflict with the administration, expect to see some busi submit, even if it mean their expens are higher than they would have been by adopt the newest technology.Of course, there' no guarante that Trump will cut green tax credits, reduc feder fund for new smart citi projects, or put ani feder pressur on compani that will impair manufactur innovations. But he ha certainli indic that he' will to push hard against compani when he doesn't agre with what they'r do -- and that mean IoT invest could certainli be at risk.10 stock we like better than Tesla MotorsWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

But at least as of right now, Supercharg onli work with Teslas. And as note above, these new DC Fast charger are a signific step ahead of the most common public charger avail in the U.S. now. That' important: Wide avail of reason fast charger will be key to convinc mainstream auto custom to make the leap to fulli electr vehicles.Th station onli work at full power with electr vehicl that have DC fast-charg capabl built in. But most new electr vehicl can be order with that capability.

But the network will help rival automak sell their electr vehicl as well -- and that in turn should help convinc all automak to make larger commit to electr vehicles.Long stori short: BMW and Nissan are take some small but import step to help lead American -- and other automak -- toward electr vehicles.10 stock we like better than BMW AGWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Better Self-Driving Car Stock: Intel Corporation vs. NVIDIA Corporation,1/25/2017,"Right now, one of the hottest trend in the semiconductor industri is the emerg market for autonom vehicles. It is gener accept that to do proper autonom vehicles, a lot of comput power is go to be need insid of the car to give them the requir ""intelligence.""Imag source: NVIDIA.makeArticleAd();Two compani that have made public their intent to aggress pursu the market for the ""brains"" insid of self-driv car are microprocessor giantIntel(NASDAQ: INTC) and graphic specialistNVIDIA(NASDAQ: NVDA) .Both compani have announc major partnership and deal with automot maker and suppliers. Intel, for instance, announc last year that it would be collabor withMobileye(NYSE: MBLY) and Delphi Automot to build platform for use by automot manufacturers.Intel hasalso saidthat, in 2016, it book self-driv car deal collect worth more than $1 billion in lifetim revenue.Last year, NVIDIA and Audi announc that they would, together, tri to bring self-driv car to market by 2020. NVIDIA' compon are also found insid ofTesla Motors'(NASDAQ: TSLA) new vehicles, as well.So, both NVIDIA and Intel both look well-posit to capit on a potenti self-driv car boom. Which stock is the better way to play it?Thes are adjac busi for bothIt' import to understand that self-driv car platform aren't either of these companies' core revenu driver today -- they'r adjac businesses. Intel' core busi is microprocessor and relat compon for person comput and data centers, and NVIDIA' core busi are graphic processor design for gaming, workstations, and data centers.An Intel chip design specif for automot use. Imag source: Intel.For Intel, autonom vehicl are just one (potenti significant) part of the company' Internet of Thing busi (though the compani did recent announc that it'd be form an autonom drive group within it Internet of Thing group). NVIDIA specif call out automot as a key long-term growth segment.Th reason that both compani look well-posit to play in the self-driv car market is becaus the technolog that they'v develop for other market (high-perform comput technologies) look to be applic to self-driv cars. However, there is addit technic and sales/market work requir to succeed in self-driv cars, and both compani appear to be make the requir increment invest to capit on these opportunities.Automot could be a bigger deal for NVIDIA than for IntelHere' the thing: Both NVIDIA and Intel have an opportun to make some real money from the self-driv market. Furthermore, the market for signific comput capabl insid of self-driv car could be quit substantial, especi if mani (if not most) car over the long term are endow with such comput capabilities.However, I think that the self-driv car market could be much more interest for NVIDIA than for Intel by Intel' sheer size rel to NVIDIA.If Intel manag to grow it Internet of Thing busi from about $3 billion in annual revenu to $5 billion in annual revenue, then that'd certainli benice, but not agam changerfor Intel, which is expect to have gener more than $58 billion in revenu dure 2016.However, if NVIDIA -- which ha gener about $6.1 billion in revenu over the last 12 month -- gener an increment $2 billion in automotive-rel revenu from self-driv car over time, then that' not onli go to significantli boost the company' top line, but it bottom line as well.Answ the titular questionAlthough I wouldn't recommend buy either Intel or NVIDIAsolelybas on the potenti for self-driv car (these are complex busi that gener most of their revenu from outsid of the automot market to begin with), NVIDIA' busi doe appear to be more like to benefit from growth in self-driv car than Intel' becaus it' a smaller one to begin with.10 stock we like better than IntelWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

GPU were equip with hundr of cores, and softwar develop realiz they could take advantag of thi raw parallel process power for much more than just graphics. The GPU could be use to greatli acceler softwar perform when repetit task are be perform - encod video, for example, or data analysis.GPU acceler can make some task 100 time fasterthan a CPU alone.Becaus the GPU is design for one primari purpos - everyth includ comput graphic boil down to crunch number - NVDA is abl to produc them at far lower cost than a CPU at an equival perform level, while produc less heat and use less power.Whi GPU Are in Higher Demand Than CPUsWhi the demand for GPUs?Think of how the demand for processor-intens comput power ha increas over the past decade. One earli exampl wa Bitcoin. The virtual currenc could be purchased, but it could also be ""mined"" by use a PC to run a complex algorithm in search of Bitcoins. Miner soon discov that a GPU - with it parallel number-crunch capabl - wa far more effect than a CPU at mine Bitcoins.Anywher from 50 to 100 time faster. Soon miner were run rig consist of multipl GPU connect together.Meantime, GPU have rapidli becom more powerful, with more core and faster clock rates, even as CPU develop ha becom rel incremental.Intel' new seventh-gener Kabi Lake Core i7 CPU for desktop comput still ha four cores. In comparison, Nvidia' latestTitan X graphic cardha 3,584 process core on tap. The Intel CPU cost less than a third of the Titan X' $1200 MSRP, but when use in number-crunch applications, the Nvidia card' price is a steal.Th technolog that ha the big potenti for futur growth involvesextremenumb crunching. Think virtual reality, the hottest trend in gaming. Cloud servic - which are often a single, processor-intens task like imag recognit offload to the web. Artifici intelligence, machin learning, data mine and deep data - these all requir incred process power. Comput run INTC CPU are too expens and too gener purpos to be run these tasks. Instead, you'r more like to find server farm power by GPUs.NVDA ha also integr it power GPU into the forefront of one of the technolog holi grails: self-driv cars.Nvidia Drive PX2i the company' AI car comput platform. With two GPU provid the horsepower, NVDA say it is capabl of 34 trillion deep learn oper per second. Addit unit can be run in parallel for fulli autonom driving. Nvidia ha alreadypartn with multipl high-profil automakersto equip their self-driv car with it technology, includingBMW,VolvoandTesla Motor Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA)Grow Import of the GPU Reflect in NVDA StockYou can track the rel trajectori in INTC and NVDA by compar their stock prices. Over the past five years, Intel ha grown in valu by a littl more than 40%. That' not bad, but doesn't look quit so good when you compar it to the height of PC popularity. Sinc 2000, when PC sale were notching14.5% annual sale growth, Intel stock ha actual drop by 10%.3 Internet of Thing (IoT) Stock to Buy Now (NVDA, ISIL, STM)In comparison, Nvidia stock is up by a whop 650% in the past five years, and nearli 2,600% sinc 2000.Intel Isn't Go Anywhere, But the Age of NVIDIA Ha ArrivedComput sale continu their slow slide,down anoth 5.7% in 2016. Much of Intel' revenu is tie to the PC market. Nvidia is not immun to the effect of declin PC sales, either.But while INTC is tri to tie it futur to technolog like the Internet of Thing (which is struggl with secur issu and compet standards), NVDA ha leverag the massiv parallel process power of it GPU to be a leader in multipl cutting-edg area like AI, deep data, virtual realiti and autonom vehicles.Increasingly, it' look like we'r enter the age of Nvidia.

How to Think About the Race to Self-Driving Cars,1/24/2017,"Alphabet' Waymo is one of sever compani insid and outsid of the tradit auto industri work to bring a self-driv solut to market. Imag source: Fiat Chrysler Automobiles.Who will win the ""race"" to a self-driv car?makeArticleAd();That' a question that lot of investor seem to be asking. It' not hard to understand why: Self-driv car could transform the way mani of us get around, and transform new technolog tend to offer big profit opportun for those who are abl to see them coming.Recently, a Foolish colleagu ask me to come up with some sort of metric that might help us judg the like ""winners"" in the race to self-driv cars, at least among the automakers. But after some thought, I decid that it' not so simpl -- and that the idea of ""winners"" might not be the right way to think about thing when it come to self-driv technology, at least in the near term.Whi it' hard to tell who is in the best posit to profit bigLot of compani in, around, and outsid of the tradit auto industri are work on autonom vehicl (AV) or ""self-driving"" technology. Some, likeTesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) are somewhat open about where they are in the develop process and when they hope to have someth on the market.But other aren't. Among establish automak and their suppliers, detail of upcom new product and technolog have tradit been held veri tightly, kept secret until a few month befor launch.Tak the exampl ofGener Motors(NYSE: GM) , which is probabl among the leader in develop AV technology. We know that GMacquir self-driv start-up Cruis Automationlast year and that the new electr Chevrolet Bolt is it ""platform"" (GM' word) fortest AV technology.A prototyp self-driv Chevrolet Bolt undergo test near GM' technic center in Warren, Michigan. Imag source: Gener Motors.W also know that GM ha been work on a not-quite-autonom system call ""Super Cruise"" that is compar to Tesla' Autopilot, and that Super Cruis ha been expect to debut as an option on a Cadillac sometim thi year (althoughthat' not certain).But we don't know when GM will bring so-cal Level 4 AV technology, a system that can provid full autonomi under some (but not all) circumstances, to market -- or how wide GM will roll it out, or evenhowit will roll out. Will it be an option on luxuri Cadillacs, a self-driv Bolt built specif for ride-hail duty, or someth els entirely? (Level 5 system that can drive anywher a human driver could are thought to be much further off.)Th same goe for most of the other automakers: We don't know exactli where their technolog is, how much they'r spending, or when (or how) they intend to bring it to market. Will they use an off-the-shelf system provid by tradit industri suppliers, or will they develop a customized, more deepli integr solut in-hous (a GM appear to be doing)?And we certainli can't tell right now how the differ system under develop are like to stack up -- or how the market will receiv them.W can make some broad guess as to when Level 4 technolog will come to market, and as to who islikelyto be among the first to bring it to market. But as you'll see, that' not necessarili help to us as investors: It' like that Level 4 technolog will be a commod not long after the first Level 4 vehicl come to market.Whi self-driv technolog will quickli becom a commodityHere' the thing that mani investor seem to miss: It look veri like the entir incumb auto industri will have access to Level 4 technolog befor long. Giant auto supplierDelphi(NYSE: DLPH) , assisted-driv specialistMobileye(NYSE: MBLY) , and chip giantIntelar work togeth on a Level 4 system that they promis will be avail to ani automak that want it by the end of 2019.It will probabl be anoth year or more after that date befor the first new car with those system go into production. But at some point, like by 2021 or so, Level 4 technolog will be a commodity: Sever other compani are known to have rival system under development.That doesn't mean that all new car will offer self-driv capabl by 2021. The system will probabl be still expens enough that they'll onli make sens for luxuri car and commerci vehicl (which might includ vehicl built for ride-hail services).Wint weather pose special challeng for self-driv systems. Imag source: Ford Motor Company.They'l also be geograph limited, and they may be limit by road condit (think snow and ice) as well. But the map will expand quickly, capabl will improv as more car rack up mile (and data), and the price of the systems' sensor and other compon will drop as more are made. Assum that it follow the pattern set by mani other new automot technolog over the years, Level 4 system will gradual becom more wide avail as cost drop.Long stori short: Level 4 technolog will probabl be offer on most new vehicl in the U.S. within a decad -- and establish auto-industri supplier will be in a posit to suppli it.Whi it doesn't make sens to think in term of ""winners"" yet""So what if,"" I ask my Foolish colleague, ""Tesla bring a Level 4 system to market in 2019 -- but then by 2021 or so, ani automak can buy it roughli compar technolog off the shelf from exist industri suppliers? Doe Tesla 'win'?""I think in such a scenario, Tesla would certainli win brag rights. That' not nothing: Brag right on new technolog add valu to Tesla' brand in a way that they might not for a big automaker.But Tesla is onli like to be abl to make 500,000 or so car a year in 2019 and 2020, and that' if all goe well with itsupcom Model 3. That' not anywher near enough to domin the global auto market -- it' not realli even enough to domin the luxury-car market in the U.S., Europe, and China. (And if the Model 3 is anywher near as good as Tesla fan expect, Tesla will be sell all it can make anyway -- with or without a Level 4 system available.)And of cours the Delphi-Mobileye-Intel system will probabl have other competit by 2021, so we can't quit declar that group to be the like ""winner"" either, at least not yet.So where doe thi leav us as investors?Good question. It' one that I'v been struggl to answer for a while.Right now, the closest thing to a ""pure play"" invest in autonom drive (among public companies, at least) is probabl Mobileye. Mobiley is a profit busi with an enviabl client list (nearli all of the world' automak do busi with Mobileye), But it' current trade at over 100 time earnings, and it' not clear that it will have the earn growth it will need to reward investor who buy at thi valuation.Meanwhile, an invest in a compani like Delphi or GM -- orAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) and it Waymo self-driv unit -- is far from a ""pure play."" Sure, AV technolog could turn out to be a profit busi for any, but it' not like to be transform (at least, not in a good way) for ani of them. But that said, it' possibl (likely, really) that some compani will come up with way to differenti their offer that allow them to win more market share or profit.Her at the Fool, we'r encourag to give our reader an ""action takeaway,"" an invest idea to research or a thought that could help you becom a better investor. When it come to self-driv technology, my takeaway for you is this: There are no obviou winner now, but there might be onc we see how the technolog is come to market.10 stock we like better than AlphabetWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Short-term support appear strong near $12, while resist should lie closer to $13, indic an upsid potenti that option market don't seem to be price in.2 Trade for F StockCal Spread:I don't see ani real issu in store for Ford' quarterli report, as most of the bad news is alreadi factor into the quarter. Guidance, however, is anoth matter, given the unknown factor of the Donald Trump administration' protectionist plans. However, I would expect Ford to be upbeat, thu lead to an F stock ralli amid low expectations.For those look to follow the prevail wind in the Ford option pits, a Feb $12.50/$13 bull call spread ha plenti of potential. At last check, thi spread wa offer at 19 cents, or $19 per pair of contracts. Breakeven lie at $12.69, while a maximum profit of 316 cents, or $31 per pair of contracts, is possibl if Ford stock close at or abov $13 when Feb. option expire.Tesla Motor Inc (TSLA) Stock Is at the Top of It RangePut Sell:If a call spread is too bullish for you, then a more neutral 27 Jan $12 put sell may be what you are look for.

That' less than the 24,500 ship in the third quarter, and product of 76,230 car fell well short of the 80,000 to 90,000 target.3 Reason Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Will Keep Deliv in 2017Tesla continu to oper onli becaus it continu to get financing.

Tesla bear should know that if the fourth quarter look like the third, they could be in for a veri rough ride.Right now, Tesla stock can do no wrong, but I'm convinc that, sometim later thi year, it will seem that it can do no right. Peopl will listen toth critics, or the compani will miss on it deliveri schedul (again) and TSLA stock will drop like a rock.At that point, buy it. Thi is not that point.

""Peopl are buy the wrong car if they expect this. There will be major rev everi 12 to 18 months.""Custom request for retrofit are a part of an old narr from Tesla owners. The first major updat for the company' vehicl came in Octob 2014, when the electric-car maker announc dual-motor all-wheel drive and the first Autopilot hardwar for it vehicles. Thi updat introduc import driver-assist safeti featur such as automat emerg brake and collis avoidance, as well as conveni driver-assist featur like automat steer and parking, adapt cruis control, Summon (a featur that allow car to move themselves), and automat parking.

AChines start up NextEValreadi claim to have built the world' fastest electr vehicle, which is like to be cheaper than Tesla' Model 3. The Chines brand electric-vehicl market is support by huge govern subsidi as China look to build global leadership in clean energy. The Chines govern ha a target of5 millionelectr vehicl to pli on the country' road by 2020 and is subsid local player to achiev larg scale production. However, these local vehicl do not offer the luxuri and long rang of Tesla and are like to gain market share on their lower costs. With China on track to becom the largest electr vehicl market in the world, sever player are look to enter thi market with a wide rang of offer creat a stiff competit environ for Tesla. Audi announc recent that it would introduc five new electr vehicl in the countri over the next five years. Gener Motors' Chines joint ventur is invest $ 3.8 billion in electrif and develop 10 'new energy' model by 2020.

"Donald Trump Inauguration: Stocks To Buy, Sell For The Next Four Years",1/20/2017,"Donald Trump (Shutterstock photo)Donald Trump ha been sworn in as the 45th presid of the Unit States. The President-elect, who pledg to “Make America great again,” promis plenti of thing he would do regard hi first day in office. From repeal and replac Obamacar to renegoti NAFTA and begin the construct of the wall on the Mexican border.W won’t know for certain which of Trump’ polici will take prioriti or how they will be enforced. But what we do know is that for Trump to make good on hi promis to bring back jobs, grow GDP and strengthen industry, he need busi to lead, innov and hire workers. For that to happen, busi leader need to know their govern is on their side. To that end, here are some name to own for the next four year (at least) as Trump’ polici take shape.makeArticleAd();Low Corpor TaxesTrump’ promis to lower corpor tax can have a boost effect on the tech sector, which ha an estim $1.4 trillion stash in oversea tax havens. These includ some America' largest corpor such as Appl (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT), which could face a huge tax hit if they bring that cash home. Not onli ha Trump promis to lower the busi tax rate from 35% to 15%, he pledg to elimin the corpor altern minimum tax.Beyond lower the tax rate, it would hardli shock anyon if Trump — given hi pro-busi stanc — were to enact a tax holiday at some point dure hi presidency. Compani like Cisco (CSCO), Facebook (FB) and Alphabet (GOOGL) would thrive. They would no longer need to borrow cheap cash to fund their operations. Likewise, a better capit Tesla (TSLA) can acceler the build of it Gigafactory, help it achiev not onli higher profit margins, but also higher vehicl production. In the process, Tesla would ignit the state of Nevada as an innov hub, while mass-produc produc emission-fre vehicl at afford prices.“Rep and Replace”Th Afford Care Act, a.k.a Obamacar wa design to — among other thing — “insur the un-insurable.” Notably, to provid insur coverag to peopl with pre-exist condit who were block under the then-exist rules. Depend on what side of the aisl you’r on, Obamacar either did it job or wa a “complet disaster,” accord to Trump. Still, whether Obamacar is entir dismantl or part of it is kept, you don’t have to look too far beyond UnitedHealth (UNH) to find a stock can will thrive.UnitedHealth ha work aggress to exit the Afford Care exchanges, which reduc it exposur to ani chang Trump might make. What’ more, ad from be the nation' largest health insurer, UnitedHealth own Optum, which provid pharmaci benefit manag services. Last week, not onli did the compani beat top- and bottom-lin estimates, UnitedHealth rais it fiscal 2017 financi outlook, suggest it is readi for whatev Trump decid to do.Not everi compani will be as lucky. Conversely, compani such HCA Hold (HCA) and Univers Health Servic (UHS) that prosper under Obamacar may suffer. As will govern health care provid such as Centen Corpor (CNC) and Molina Healthcare, Inc. (MOH).Scal Back Dodd-FrankCut down strict regul impos on financi institut ha been anoth polici Trump ha proposed. After all, how can he achiev econom growth and strengthen small busi if bank aren't lend money — someth bank collect struggl to do under Dodd-Frank. But as evidenc by the strong earn result releas so far from the like of Bank of America (BAC), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C) and Goldman Sach (GS), financi are onc again the sector to bank on.Written to strengthen consum protect and creat tougher rule on excess risk-taking, the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act ha been cite by bank execut as a prohibit of growth. ""There' mani aspect of it that we'v got to kill,"" said Steven Mnuchin, Trump' pick for Treasuri secretary. Mnuchin former partner at Goldman Sachs, call Dodd-Frank ""the number one prioriti on the regulatori side.”To that end, I would be surpris if Trump doesn’t take to “repeal and replace” Dodd-Frank in hi first 100 day in office. Combin with the prospect of higher interest rates, lower tax it’ tough to ignor the potenti upsid a bank like Morgan Stanley (MS) can provide. It’ not just the big bank that will prosper, however. Keep an eye on super region like Comerica (CMA), US Bancorp (USB) and PNC Financi (PNC), which Trump ha made great again."
Why Boring AT&T Inc. (T) Stock Can Work For (Or Against) You,1/20/2017,"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade Tips""Bor is good"" forAT&T Inc.(NYSE:T), accord to InvestorPlac writer and IPO Playbook Editor Tom Taulli, and for whatev it' worth, I mostli agree. But really, what choic do I have? AT&T as a corpor entiti ha exist for over 50 year abov the averag American lifespan. Thi isn't Elon Musk andTesla Motor Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA). And I highli doubt that there are T stock fan boy troll the internet to defend the honor of AT&T.Source:Mik Mozart via FlickrMayb that' a bit of a low blow. T stock isn't irrelev by ani means. In fact, AT&T score the biggest ""T"" of our media ecosystem - as in Taylor Swift.makeArticleAd();I don't need to haul in load of statist for you to understand the market power behind the company' ""Taylor Swift Now"" experience. Just by name recognition, AT&T can piggyback off the social media and pop cultur phenomenon.But will thi and other deal translat to profit for T stock investors? The initi sign don't look too hot. Presently, AT&T stock is just a few cent higher than when ""Taylor Swift Now"" launched. At one point, T wa up 4% gener by the enthusiasm.Whi Investor Love T stockAt the same time, T stock just gave investor a 30% return last year. Obviously, they'r do someth right. It would be intellectu dishonest not to acknowledg and credit the success of AT&T.First, the vener compani is make some savvi moves. The most conspicu of these is the acquisit ofTim Warner Inc(NYSE:TWX). Although thi deal ha it own set of inher risk - we are talk about media and entertainment, after all - AT&T is load with money. More importantli from an administr perspective, itsfre cash flowi inde free and flowing. If anybodi can absorb the risk, it' T stock.10 Compani That Should Fear Donald Trump' ""America First"" PlansThen there' the excit detail written in the fine print. The compani ha revamp it acquisit of DirecTV with standard-bear stream services. Also, the introductori rate for new DirecTV custom is $35 a month, which then move up to a still agreeabl $60 regular rate. Best of all, the platform is well-integr with others, includingAppl Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) TV andAmazon.com, Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AMZN) Fire TV.If initi report are anyth to go by, T ha a big winner on it hands. There' good reason to believ that the late winter ralli of AT&T stock wa primarili attribut to DirecTV' popularity.Of course, anyon that ha had their eye on T stock know that the AT&T dividend is a huge draw. With a 4.7% yield, that is veri difficult to ignore. Thi is all the more true consid that high rate of passiv incom typic carri signific capit risk. I don't know about you, but I'm pretti certain that thi compani isn't go anywher ani time soon. Furthermore, the payout on the AT&T dividend ha steadili increas over the last 32 years.I the Relationship With AT&T Get Old?So whi on earth would anyon cast doubt on T stock? The problem for me is that AT&T is in the mainten business. As Taulli notes, the compani ha ""79.4 million busi wireless subscribers, 53.9 million consum wireless subscrib and 25.3 million video subscribers. More importantly, AT&T ha the benefit of a power moat - that is, a nationwid fiber optic network. Replic thi would be incred expensive."" Although impressive, there' not much more that T can do in that depart besid annex Canada.Thi is a point of heat contention, but it' definit worth mention - tradit media is dying.Naturally, I'm leeri of organ and invest like AT&T stock, where salvat come from a steadili archaic industry. And here' anoth scari thought: Accord toInc, a major of millennialsdon't even watchtelevision.Don't Sweat Under Armour Inc (UA) Stock -- Here' WhyThi lead to a disconcert theory. Mayb it' not that T stock is irrelevant; rather, it' their core busi that is lose influence. If AT&T' invest are focus on chase yesterday' trends, that might be a hindranc when tomorrow come around.At the end of the day, none of thi matter depend on your person perspective. If you'r look for growth and have the time frame to take on heavier risks, avoid T stock. It just doesn't have the specul potenti that' necessari to reliabl produc great gains. In addition, the AT&T dividend isn't that big of a deal unless you'r put seriou capit to work.Which then bring T stock to where it most belong - in a conserv retir portfolio. For that purpose, there aren't that mani superior candidates.

Should You Take the Wheel in General Motors Company (GM) or Ford Motor Company (F)?,1/20/2017,"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsI rememb stop at a roadsid ga station in Arkansa as a child and see a bumper sticker that read ""I'd rather walk down the highway hold a Ford steer wheel than drive a Chevy."" Of course, immedi next to thi sticker wa an almost ident one that read ""I'd rather walk down the highway hold a Chevi steer wheel than drive a Ford."" While my eight-year-old mind found both sticker to be hilari and somehow profound, I wasn't sure - as the owner of a Pontiac - where my famili stood in thi peck order.makeArticleAd();Source:William Oliv via Flickr (Modified)I tri to be a littl less tribal when it come to investing. I'm comfort own bothGener Motor Company(NYSE:GM) andFord Motor Company(NYSE:F) stock if the price are compel enough. (And in fact, I do own both GM stock and F stock in my Dividend Growth portfolio.) But today, we'r go to do a good, old-fashion Ford vs GM stock smack down.GM Vs. F: ValuationI'l start first with valuation. The entir auto sector look cheap right now, and Gener Motor and Ford are certainli not exceptions.At current prices, GM stock trade for a ridicul 4.3 time trail earn and 6.1 time forward earn estimates. F stock isn't exactli expensive, mind you, trade at trail and forward earn multipl of 5.9 and 7.6, respectively. But GM is the cheaper stock base on earnings.7 Stock to Sell Befor They ImplodeLook at the price/sal ratio, which elimin some of the account issu that can make direct comparison difficult, it' essenti a wash. Gener Motor and Ford trade for 0.35 and 0.32 time their respect annual sales.So, in a world in which few stock can credibl be call ""cheap,"" GM stock and F stock are clearli exceptions. At these prices, investor are essenti price in year of earn stagnat or outright shrinkage. And hey, automak obvious have less growth potenti today than they did a gener ago, particularli with ride share rise in popular and the concept of a car as a servic rather than an asset is start to take shape. And the strong sale of recent year will probabl take a breather. But at 4 to 6 time earnings, it' hard to argu the bad news wasn't price in a long time ago.Winner:Gener MotorsGM Vs. F: DividendNext, let' consid the dividends. At current prices, Gener Motor and Ford sport dividend yield of 4.1% and 4.8%, respectively, make both high yielder by the standard of today' market. So F stock look ever so slightli more appeal base on the raw yield.Of course, there is more to a dividend than just it current yield. There is also the issu of growth. Sinc reinstat it dividend in 2014, Gener Motor ha alreadi rais it 27%. Over that same period, Ford ha rais it regular dividend by a smaller 20% but also paid two special dividend that collect equal a full two quarters' worth of regular dividend at the current rate. So when it come to dividends, Ford is the clear winner here.Winner:FordGM Vs. F: Futur ProofingI'm go to skip the usual banter about whether the Chevi Silverado or the Ford F-150 sell more truck next quarter. No, instead we'r go to focu on which one of these old-economi compani is do a better job of prepar for the future.I'l start with Gener Motors. GM is look to compet head on with the like of electr car leaderTesla Motor Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) with the Chevi Bolt. Now, Tesla clearli win that contest base on both style and performance, but the Bolt is no slouch. For driver want to move beyond the intern combust engine, the Bolt is a viabl option.But even bigger in my mind are GM' embrac of both ride share and autonom self-driv car via it partnership with bothLyftandUber. Last year, GM ink deal with both ride share compani to profit from the transform of car transport from a person asset to a pay-as-you-go service.Rath that buri their head in the sand, GM' leader are embrac thi trend. And GM' partnership with Lyft will ideal creat the infrastructur to make self-driv car a practic realiti for the masses.Short Tesla Motor Inc (TSLA) Stock While It' OverhypedFord is make it own efforts, of course, with a goal of creat it own fleet of self-driv car by 2021. Ford also ha an electr version of the Focus. But all in all, GM seem to be do a slightli better job of embrac the future. We'r still earli in the game, and a lot can happen. But for now, I'm give the nod to Gener Motors.Winner:Gener MotorsThi give GM the slight edg overall. Of course, no one ever said you have to choos just one.

Will Solar Manufacturing Be a Costly Mistake for Tesla?,1/20/2017,"When it bought SolarC late in 2016,Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) may have taken on a manufactur challeng that make automobil look easy. The solar industri ha left a string of bankrupt manufactur over the past decade, and a price drop of over 30% in 2016 alon could be a sign that more revenu pressur is ahead.Amid thi backdrop, Tesla is tri to make new technolog work at scale, is bring in a new partner, and is launch the solar roof. That' a lot to take on all at once, and it could be more than even Tesla can handle.makeArticleAd();Imag source: Tesla.Tesla' manufactur plan are complicated, at bestSolarC wa in the process of build out manufactur capac use technolog it acquir from Silevo when it wa acquir by Tesla. The acquisit meant bringingPanasonic, Tesla' batteri partner, and it HIT technolog into SolarCity' plant.Panasonic' technolog ha similar to Silevo, but is differ enough that they'r not a natur fit. There' also the small complic that Silevo use a 156 mm cell and Panason use a 126 mm cell. In other words, bring SolarCity, Silevo, and Panason technolog under one roof is far from a trivial task.It' unclear how much equip wa instal befor the Tesla acquisition, but there' certainli some Silevo technolog in SolarCity' Buffalo facility. In it research,PV Techalso cite job post that includ languag about Silevo technolog as evid that Panason won't be the sole technolog in the plant.W also know that Tesla will be make solar roof cell and shingl in the Buffalo plant. In other words, Tesla will need to manufactur three separ product in the facility.Solar manufactur is hardMak one solar product cost competit is hard enough. But Tesla is now tri to make three product simultaneously, and is face a solar industri that current is under price pressure. The price of solar panel fell over 30% in 2016, and price are now around $0.40 per watt for commod solar panels, which, not coincidentally, is what SolarC is still instal as it ramp up solar manufacturing.Neith Tesla or SolarC ha given ani inform about what effici or cost look like come out of in-hous manufactur to thi point. But given delay in launch solar panel and the fact that Panason had to be brought in as a partner, we can discern that it isn't go well.Th financi impact could be big if manufactur fails. New York wa nice enough tobuild the $750 million plant and buy equip for it, but that came with a commit to spend $5 billion in the state over the next decade, includ hire 1,460 high-tech workers. And SolarC estim it would still spend around $150 million in capit cost at the plant, plu cost overruns. If SolarCity, and now Tesla, fail to meet oblig for invest and job creation in New York it could be oblig to pay $41.2 million per year as a ""program payment"". If panel aren't competitive, it' safe to say the impact on Tesla could measur in the hundr of million in losses.Whi Tesla doesn't need solar manufactur in the first placeAt the same time that Tesla is tri to complet manufactur plant to make three products, competitor are improv technolog and lower costs. On top of the alreadi low and declin cost for commod panels, mani manufactur are build out mono-PERC high-effici manufactur capacity. Mono-PERC technolog that' be built out is compar in effici to what Panason wa producing, so Buffalo may not have much, or any, effici advantag over competitors.In other words, Tesla could be buy solar panel in the open market that would be similar to what the Buffalo plant would make. No headaches, no risk, no promis to invest in manufactur capac that may not be cost competit at scale.It look like get into solar manufactur wa an unnecessari risk for SolarCity, and now it' a problem for Tesla. Investor should hope it' not a distract that becom a financi drain, someth the compani doesn't need right now.10 stock we like better than Tesla MotorsWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Share tumbl from as high as $70 to just $28 today, a crush 60% decline. Is TWLO stock final cheap enough today, or is there room for even more downside?Source:Web Summit Via FlickrOn the plu side, numer analyst are upgrad the firm as the price drops. And a new partnership could reinvigor the growth story.makeArticleAd();But don't overlook the risk here either. Just becaus a stock ha fallen a long way alreadi doesn't mean it can't keep dropping. Befor you hit the ""buy"" or ""sell"" button on TWLO stock, however, take a minut to consid both side of the coin.TWLO Stock ConsTwilio Doesn't Have a Moat:Twilio ha gener a lot of interest in it servic due to afford pricing. The compani is oper with a neg 15% net profit margin. And thi figur ha hardli budg over the past year, even as revenu ha soared. You would expect to see scale effect by thi point. One altern hypothesi is that Twilio ha underpr it services. It doesn't appear to have a genuin technolog moat. Much of what the compani doe would probabl not requir excess effort for it custom to do internally. A compani such asFacebook Inc(NYSE:FB) alway ha the option of build their own messag market platform. But whi bother if Twilio is will to provid the servic at less than cost? However, that sentiment could chang quickli the moment Twilio tri to rais prices.Valu Still an Issue:On of the issu with low-float IPO such as Twilio is that the stock can run far beyond seemingli logic valuations. TWLO stock soar out of the gate, but thi wa like mostli due to the limit number of publicli trade shares. Insid still control the vast major of the company. They'v been slowli sell more of the stock into the market, depress the price. However, given that initi pop to $70, mani investor have a mental anchor there. They see a drop from $70 to $28 and think it must be cheap now. However, compar Twilio with other firm in it space. It 9x EV/sal figur is still astoundingli high, and is in fact the highest in it entir peer group. The company' revenu growth rate is slow down enough to make it difficult to justifi pay up for Twilio' expens revenues.10 Compani That Should Be in the Dow JonesPosit News, But Stock Isn't Moving:Th poor perform TWLO stock ha deliv late demonstr the valuat issues. The compani ha gotten a stream of upgrad along with the announc of a potenti game-chang partnership withAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN). More on thi below. Despit all the good news, TWLO stock hasn't gone anywhere. After each bit of posit news or analyst upgrade, the stock pop for a day or two and then give back all the gains. Thi is indic of an overpr stock. Owner are happi to use ani pop to sell, while short seller show no nervousness.TWLO Stock ProsNewsflow Turn Positive:In recent weeks, TWLO stock ha seen mani posit news announcements. In late December, Drexel Hamilton start the compani with a ""buy"" opinion. Pacif Crest Secur upgrad the firm to start 2017. And just thi week, two more firm weigh in, with Canaccord Genuiti upgrad it to a ""buy,"" and Oppenheim name TWLO stock a 2017 top pick. If that weren't enough, in late December, Twilioform an expand partnershipwith Amazon. Amazon Web Servic had alreadi partner with Twilio to deliv text messag for AW customers. Now that capabl will be expand to includ voic messaging, greatli expand Twilio' reach within the boom AW ecosystem.Short Squeez Potential:Normally, you see short seller pile into a stock as it soars. However, that' not alway the case; sometim short seller pile onto a plung stock. That' exactli what they'v done with TWLO stock. As TWLO stock peak in late September, short interest wa just 64% of the float. That' a huge number, yes, but it wa about to get bigger. In November, short interest top 100% of the float (a veri rare occurrence). By the end of November, short interest hit 116% of the float, suggest that for everi 5 tradabl share of TWLO stock, 6 had been sold short. Thi is rather sketchy, as gener exchang regul prohibit thi sort of behavior. Even with the continu weak in Twilio stock, short interest ha hardli budg - the most recent data ha it at 8.8 million shares, or 102% of the float. Needless to say, ani concentr effort by these short seller to dispos of their posit could set off a larg ralli in the stock.Earn Soon:TWLO stock need someth to reset the narrative. Over the past month, Twilio ha seen a varieti of posit developments, center around the upgrad partnership with Amazon and numer stock upgrades. However, trader are still focus on insid sell and the company' high valuat level. At thi point, earn in a coupl of week could be the catalyst that final reviv the bull case. Twilio is trade not far off IPO level now, it'd take some gumption for the short to press the stock through that level. On the other hand, given the massiv short interest, even a modest beat could send the stock flying. Rememb that Twilio initi trade down on earn last quarter, but buyer appear shortli thereafter.Bottom Line on TWLO StockTrad have punish TWLO stock over the past quarter.

Tesla Motors Upgraded: 3 Things You Need to Know,1/19/2017,"It' been nearli two month sinceTesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) final it acquisit of SolarCity, unifi two of altern energy' lead light under Elon Musk' leadership --and Wall Street hate them both.Accord to data from rate aggregatorStreetInsider.com, the past six or so month have seenTesla stockbombard with neg sentiment -- a brand-new sell rate (from Cowen), two downgrad (Argu and Goldman Sachs), and two underwhelm initi of coverag at ""hold"" (from Deutsch Bank and Berenberg). But finally, at long last, someon had someth nice to say about Tesla today.makeArticleAd();Morgan Stanley just upgrad the stock. Here are three thing you need to know about that.Tesla' Model 3 electr sedan could hit big -- and mean big thing for Tesla stock. Imag source:Tesla.1. Whi Morgan Stanley love TeslaIn a long, drawn-out sketch of Tesla' sever move parts, Morgan Stanley hit upon three key reason it think investor should own the stock. These include:Th impend launch of theModel 3 mass market electr sedan, which Morgan Stanley now see arriv sooner than it had feared, and deliv ""a signific posit impact on earn and our price target.""Decreas competit from Silicon Valley rivals, with ""tech firms"" such asGoogleandAppleno longer seem as interest as they onc were in produc whole brand electr car on their own. Morgan think they'r now more inclin to just build bit and piec of softwar that Detroit can then insert into the car that it build (and presumably, Morgan Stanley see Detroit as easier than Silicon Valley for Tesla to beat).And gener speaking, Morgan believ that America is ""move Tesla' way"" in it willing to adopt electr car over gasoline-pow horseless carriages. Accord to the analyst, Tesla ""stand at the epicent of US high tech manufactur job creation,"" and will benefit disproportion as thi industri evolves.Put it all together, and Morgan Stanley is convinc Tesla stock will outperform the market, and assign the stock a $305 price target -- 25% more than what the stock cost today.2. Sum up those partsThat' the big picture. Now here are a few specifics.In work up it valuat on Tesla stock, Morgan Stanley specif excludes, and assign ""zero value"" to Tesla' ""Energy"" batteri business. Instead, Morgan get the it basic target price from valu (a) how mani car Tesla is like to produce, and subtract from that valu (b) the number of car Teslafail to produc as promisedlast year, and (c) the cost of ""higher capex"" as Tesla build it business.Work these numbers, Morgan arriv at a base valu for Tesla of $229 per share, which Morgan Stanley admit is ""slightli below the current share price.""3. Tesla' X-factorSo how doe Morgan move from $229 to $305 on it target price? Thi is the third part of the equation, and it may surpris you. The compani assign fulli $76 in share price to the valu of Tesla' proposedTesla Mobilitycar-shar servic -- which doesn't actual exist yet.It non-exist notwithstanding, Morgan boldli proclaim that ""over 100% of the upsid to our $305 price target can be attribut to the valu we ascrib to Tesla Mobility."" And ad $76 to $229, the compani find the entir compani to be worth 25% more than it cost today.That' a big leap of faith that Morgan Stanley is making, granted. But it' worth note that the analyst ha actual ratchet back it expectations. As the Fool' own Alex Dumorti ha note previously, in 2015, Morgan Stanley said Tesla Mobilitycould be worth $244 a shareto Tesla. And ifthatpredict turn out to be true, then the stock could liter doubl from today' $244 share price.Bonu thing: How much is a Model 3 worth?Granted, much of the abov remain specul -- the zero valu of Tesla' nascent batteri business, and the incred valu of the car-shar busi that ha yet to begin operations. Meanwhile, Tesla ha yet to prove it can earn a profit fromanyof it busi over the cours of a full financi year. For the time being, the stock is still be valu larg on the volum of car it produces, regardless of the profit that they do or do not produce.And thi bring us to the final valuabl tidbit of inform contain in Morgan Stanley' report. Accord to the analyst, $81 of it $305 price target come from Morgan Stanley' belief that Tesla will deliv 75,000 ""additional"" Model 3s in 2018, and ""nearli 100,000 units"" in 2020. If you crunch those numbers, therefore, it appear that Morgan Stanley is valu each 1,000 car sold in 2018 at about $0.50 in ad share valu for Tesla stock (75 x $0.50 = $37.50 per share), and valu each 1,000 car sold two year later at about $0.435 per 1,000 unit (100 x $0.435 = $43.50 per share).Know thi may give you an idea of what to expect in futur upgrad (and downgrades) from Morgan Stanley, as Tesla deliv (and fail to deliver) on it car deliveri promises. Simpli put, for everi 1,000 unit that Elon Musk promis to investors, add $0.435 to the stock price -- and for everi 1,000 car that Tesla actuallydelivers, you can mark up the valu of Tesla stock by $0.50.10 stock we like better than Tesla MotorsWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Profit From Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Stock No Matter Which Way It Moves,1/17/2017,"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsOn of my favorit topic in the stock market these day isTesla Motor Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA). For anyon who like an underdog stori fill with drama and suspense, TSLA stock is as good as it gets.makeArticleAd();Source:Mik Lau via Flickr (Modified)Tesla - the compani - ha been an incred success up to thi point. TSLA stock ha also been one of the best stock in the market in the past five years. Unfortunately, the compani now ha extrem high expectations, and Tesla stock ha an even higher valuation. I'v been veri critic of the bull case for TSLA. I wholeheartedli believ it' one of the most danger popular stock in the market today.Yet I am the first to admit that if the Tesla stori ha a happi ending, it could easili doubl within the next coupl of years. If not, I believ the bottom will fall out of the stock and the compani may end up dead in the water.Th TSLA Stock Bear CaseIn the past four quarters, Tesla shipped76,000 automobiles, gener over $6 billion in revenu and regist $874 million in net incom losses. Last year,Gener Motor Company(NYSE:GM) ship 9.8 million automobil globally.In the past four quarters, GM gener $162.1 billion in revenu and report net profit of $14 billion. Yet somehow, TSLA stock is valu at a market cap of $39.2 billion compar to GM' valuat of $56.9 billion.7 Stock to Buy to Doubl Your Money in 2017Why? The Tesla bull case involv the Model 3 and subsequ afford Tesla model take over the global mass auto market. If that' the case, TSLA stock will eventu justifi it absurd valuation.I'm skeptical. Elon Musk ha made too mani promis that will requir perfect execut to keep. Anyon who ha oper in the busi world know thing rare go exactli accord to plan. Tesla plan to ramp product from 50,000 in 2015 to 76,000 in 2016 to 500,000 in 2018. Musk also promis that Model 3s will begin ship by the end of 2017 andwil startat $35,000.Just ask ani TSLA stock bull, and those are the reason they like the stock. To me, that mean that at the bare minimum, all of those assumpt need to actual happen to justifi Tesla' current valuation.TSLA Stock Is Too Danger to ShortUnfortun for trader bet against TSLA stock, they have plenti of company. Accord toshortsqueeze.com, it ha a short percent of float of nearli 30% with 8.7 day to cover. That mean ani dip in share price will like be met with short covering. Ani potenti good news could also be follow by a huge short squeeze.Despit my belief that TSLA stock is extrem overvalued, these risk have kept me away from ever take a short posit in the stock. The way I see it, Tesla ha so much potenti for volatil in the next coupl of years, both long and short are play a danger game.When a friend ask me the other day where I think TSLA' share price will be by 2019, I told him probabl $50. Then I ad that if it' not below $100, it will probabl be abov $500. Tesla is either go to deliv on it stori with a happi end or it won't.A LEAP Straddl Bet On TSLA StockAft the convers with my friend, I got to think about the hypothet $50 or $500 binari outcom for TSLA stock and what could be the best way to creat a neutral trade base on that idea. The uncertainti make long-term option veri expensive. But if you agre with my premis that Tesla will be make a major move one way or the other within the next coupl of years, it is possibl to set up a straddl trade use 2019 TSLA LEAPS.At a strike price of $220, the Jan 2019 TSLA LEAP call last trade at about $57. The $220 put last trade at around $50. If you invest equal in both options, you will requir roughli a $100 move in one direct or the other to break even on your trade. That mean that if TSLA end up abov $320 or below $120 by Januari 2019, you'v made a profit. If TSLA end up at $50, you'v earn a return of roughli 70%. If TSLA make it to $500, you'v earn a return of roughli 180%.Take Advantag of a Misunderstood Fitbit Inc (FIT) StockThos return are lopsid simpli becaus the option market appear to be fairli bearish on TSLA stock in the long-term.If you'r on the fenc about which direct Tesla stock is head in the next two year but agre with the idea that it will be make a huge move in one direct or the other, consid a 2019 LEAP straddl trade like the one describ above. Then you can simpli sit back and enjoy the end of the TSLA story, one way or another.A of thi writing, Wayn Duggan did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlace7 Healthcar Stock That Will Crippl Your Portfolio10 Dividend Growth Stock That Simpli Print MoneyTh postProfit From Tesla Motor Inc (TSLA) Stock No Matter Which Way It Movesappear first onInvestorPlace."

Why 2017 Is the Year to Invest in Artificial Intelligence Stocks,1/16/2017,"Imag source: Getti Images.Th other day I sat in a coffe shop across from a student who wa studi a complex math problem. The equat took up the entir page, and he sat there stare at it for quit awhile. After I thought about how glad I am to not be in school anymore, I start think about how jump into a new invest market can be intimidating. Like the math equation, it can be hard to make sens of all the inform on the page.But it doesn't have to be thi way, especi if you close follow what smart compani are do in new segment and pair that with some good ol' fashion research.makeArticleAd();Artifici intellig (AI) is one such opportun where compani are make big bet on it and where the research back up it potential. And if AI pan out the way mani are thinking, then 2017 may be a veri good year to get on board with thi technolog shift.AI is at an inflect pointIn 2016, the AI market wa worth just $644 million, accord to Tractica. Thi year, that amount will nearli doubl and then grow exponenti from there. Take a look:Data source:TracticaandStatista.Clearly, we'r still at the begin of AI' revenu possibilities, and it opportun will acceler over the come the year until it reach $37.8 billion less than 10 year from now.Growth in the AI market will be spur on by mani larg tech compani that implement AI into their current businesses. For example,Facebook(NASDAQ: FB) use it own intern develop AI program to read the post we put on Facebook and understand the context they'r written in. The company' DeepText program read thousand of post in just second and doe so across 20 differ languages. Facebook also use deep learn to tag our friend in photos, and is even use AI to identifi peopl (and their voices!) in videos.But AI is expand it reach outsid of the technolog sector as well. There' plenti of talk about self-driv car these day (I'v done my fair share) and that' becaus the number of vehicl worldwid with some level of autonomi will hit 76 million by 2035 -- and be worth $77 billion by that year.That growth is be fueled, at least in part, by AI.NVIDIA Corporation(NASDAQ: NVDA) is use it graphic processor (GPUs) to creat some of the most sophist imag process supercomputers, like the company'sDr PX 2. The comput is be use by 80 automak and auto supplier already, andTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) recent said that it would use some of NVIDIA' technolog in it next version of it semi-autonom Autopilot drive feature.Tesla is itself becom a leader in AI technologies, and back in October, the compani post a video of it self-driv AI drive a person around in one of it vehicl -- complet hands-fre -- as it navig stop signs, bicyclists, and foggi roads.Imag source: Tesla.OK, so technolog compani are obvious bet on AI' future, and NVIDIA is prove that the automot sector will bank on AI as well, but it' import to note that govern are bet on AI' growth as well.China announc last year that it govern will invest in new AI technolog over the next three years, as it tri to creat it own $15 billion AI market. And even the U.S. govern ha taken notic of China' recent focu on artifici intelligence. In areportreleas back in October, the White Hous said that Chines scientist are publish far more AI research than American scientist and that their work is be cite more often. The U.S. then urg more AI research and develop spend in order to catch up and improv econom growth.Th South Korean govern recent turn it attent to AI as well. AfterGoogle' DeepMind AI beat a South Korean grandmast Go player in an exhibit match in Seoul, the countri pledg $863 million to develop more AI technolog and call on privat compani to invest even more.There' no turn back nowWith so mani compani (and lead world powers) focus their attent on AI, there' no stop the momentum now. Investor wait around to see how AI play out could be left in the dust, as thi technolog shift begin to speed up even faster thi year. Of course, there' no guarante that 2017 will be the best year to invest in AI. But if all of the AI focu from 2016 spill into thi year, then it certainli look like a good bet.10 stock we like better than NvidiaWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Up to 1.8 million barrel a day, includ the 11 other countri that commit to --O'Reilly:Right. The big stori a coupl week ago wa that Mexico wa in on it, and blah blah blah.Muckerman:And Russia, yeah.O'Reilly:I actual just saw on the wire thi morn that Iraq ha alreadi cut production. They'r actual do it.Muckerman:Yeah, they'r cut medium and heavi crude, which is basic what everybodi produc over there.O'Reilly:I'm mildli impress with how everybodi is actual do what they said they would do.Muckerman:Well, we don't know the degre to the extent that they have cut. But yeah, they have start to cut, along with Oman and Kuwait as well. There' at least three out of the OPEC members.O'Reilly:We'r 10% there, yay.Muckerman:Yeah. We don't know much about the other countries. Mexico wasn't necessarili cutting; they were just expect a natur declin of oil wells, without have the replac there. But of those 11, all eye are on Russia, who hasn't begun to cut or provid ani guidanc of when they might decid to.O'Reilly:I get the distinct impress that Russia view the world as be on a need-to-know basis.Muckerman:Yeah. I think mayb they'r wait to see what happen when everyon els cuts, and if price rise, they'r probabl go to be like, ""Well, you know what? Thanks, guys!""O'Reilly:Well, you know that Saudi Arabia alreadi increas their price -- you know how they set monthli price to Asia and the U.S. and stuff. They alreadi up it a littl bit becaus of the cut. They'r like, ""We cut production, so we'r up the price.""Muckerman:Yeah, up prices. But we mention thi a coupl week ago, straight from the mouth of the former Saudi Arabian oil minist talk about OPEC and their previou cuts, saying, ""We tend to cheat."" So, we'll be surpris to see 100% of that 1.8 million barrel per day cut. Analyst I'v seen, aGoldman Sachsanalyst say he believ around 84% of that total will be achieved. I'v seen as low as 70%.O'Reilly:Well, befor the holiday, you said ""historically."" You said, you usual get about two-thirds?

That includ pension and stock he own and the $180 million payout he' set to receiv simpli for becom the Secretari of State.O'Reilly:It' good to be the king.Muckerman:Yeah, not too shabby. But on top of that, he ha hold in sever other oil companies, producers, servic companies. You'r look atRoy Dutch Shell,Chevron,Schlumberger(NYSE: SLB) , [Gener Electric].

It' like have a kid you want to be a wrestler and never let him lay down on hi back. That' basic what happen when you name your kid Rex Tillerson.O'Reilly:Boom. Move on to the oil market, the OPEC cut is actual have it desir effect, at least for the price of oil. But that, of course, ha side effects, like the increas drill activ here domest in the Unit States. Go to happen. Saudi knew it. It is what it is.Muckerman:It' alreadi happening. We saw product pick up later in the year of 2016. You'd imagin it will.O'Reilly:And refresh my memory, I think U.S. product drop about a million barrels? We were at about 9.6 million and it drop to 8.6 million?Muckerman:Someth like that, yeah.O'Reilly:ButHalliburton(NYSE: HAL)i hire 200 worker in, unsurprisingly, the Permian Basin. I think you sent me thi article?Muckerman:Yeah. That' the hotness.O'Reilly:They laid off a ton of people, though.Muckerman:Yeah. Last year, if you look at the announc layoff --O'Reilly:Thousands. Ten of thousands.Muckerman:-- energi servic compani were the worst by far. Schlumberg had two of the top five largest announc layoff last year, and Halliburton wa also right up there. So yeah, I don't know if here' our new jobs, but either they'r shift 200 to the Permian, or they'r announc actual hire 200 new folks.O'Reilly:I wasn't particularli impress with this. One, it' like, 200 guys. Who are we kidding? Hundr of thousand of peopl have lost their jobs. Two, it' in the Permian. Not surpris at all, either. The other headlin we were talk about befor we came in here wa driller cap their record year for stock sale with a huge bump in December, which is, again, not surpris becaus OPEC gave the oil industri a wonder Thanksgiv present.Muckerman:Yes, they did.O'Reilly:Thi seem like a slightli bigger deal.Muckerman:Yes. You'r look at these compani go out there. Mostly, these are small to mid-siz companies. You'r not see big equiti rais from the integrated, or anyth like [EOGResources] or [PioneerEnergi Services].O'Reilly:Plus, they don't need the cash, but they have a littl bit of an opening, and they need to rais money.Muckerman:Yeah. So you have [DiamondbackEnergy] rais money to purchas asset in West Texas.Gulfport Energyrais some money to buy asset in Oklahoma. There are a few other compani out there as well. You look at a record year for issuanc by oil and ga producers: $31.3 billion in 2016, which is twice as much as you saw in 2015.O'Reilly:That is amazing. What wa it in 2014?Muckerman:2014, not off the top of my head.O'Reilly:Still, that' crazy.Muckerman:Yeah. Just in Decemb alone, they rais about --O'Reilly:And thi wa equity, not debt.Muckerman:Yeah, thi wa all equity.O'Reilly:That is stagger to me.Muckerman:Som were pay down debt, but most of them, I think, are just gear up, not necessarili to immedi drill, but they think it' about time, so they'r pad the wall here.O'Reilly:Yeah, that doe seem to be in effect.Muckerman:And it might prove prescient, becaus right now, you'r look at expect that the cost of drill and frack is go to rise about 20% thi year, simpli becaus compani like Halliburton and Schlumberg andBak Hughesand [Weatherford International], the servic companies, gave price concess over the last coupl year to help these driller maintain a low cost per barrel to produce, so that they could actual do some drilling. They'r probabl go to tri and claw that back. On top of that, higher demand in general, the servic are go to be stretch becaus of the layoff that we talk about. So you'r look at, maybe, up to a 20% increas in the price of fracking, which could add up to $10 per barrel to the base cost.O'Reilly:Yeah. Wa that a month ago that you first mention that? We'v talk about it before.Muckerman:I'v had it in my mind for a littl while. Yeah, those price concess were pretti serious.O'Reilly:They'v been nice, but now they want to make money, too.Muckerman:Absolutely. And these producers, they can't acquir the oil and natur ga without these companies. So they'r the bottleneck, and if they don't get the price they want, you know what?O'Reilly:Gam over. So, Mr. Muckerman...Muckerman:What?O'Reilly:We'r go to go from guy get oil out of the ground to the next stage of what might be how the world is power with energy. Carbon emiss for 2016, we just found out, are expect to be the lowest sinc 1992. What were you do in 1992, Taylor?Muckerman:Well, let' see. I wa 7.O'Reilly:Y were play Power Rangers.Muckerman:Prob play outsid and har the power of the sun myself. Vitamin D.O'Reilly:I have to think that a lot of thi is just becaus of way more effici cars.Muckerman:Effici cars, yeah, that' big. The switch from coal to natur ga to gener power in the Unit States. We saw, thi year, for the first time ever, natur ga overtook coal as the largest provid of fuel to creat electricity. So that' a big thing. And I think peopl drove a lot more thi year becaus ga is so cheap. I don't have the exact specif on me.O'Reilly:Ther were statistics. It' a calculation, like, do we fli or drive? Especi if you have a famili of four, it' veri price-dependent. And ga wa cheap.Muckerman:When you start keepingVolkswagenhonest, you get down to the bottom of it, and you take all those older car off the street that were pollut more than we thought --O'Reilly:Wait, are you impli that Volkswagen is the reason for thi drop?Muckerman:Quit possibly. Mayb they should be laud now instead of...O'Reilly:Ther were a lot of Volkswagen Jetta includ in this, now that you mention that.Muckerman:Yeah, millions! Globally. I don't know about how mani were impact in the U.S. But yeah. Big deal.O'Reilly:Also a part of it might be -- and we talk about thi befor -- but solar power is on the rise in Texa in 2016. That's, of course, the other part of this. Also, I don't know if you saw, fool.com writer Travi Hoium, he recent wrote a piec about how La Vega is entir green now for their energy.Muckerman:No kidding?O'Reilly:Yeah. They'r in a desert, so it' like, what are you go to do?Muckerman:So that hockey stadium is go to be complet solar powered?O'Reilly:Yeah. Isn't that nice? But, same deal in Texas. Desert land, noth grows, let' put up some solar panels.Muckerman:They'r catch up to California and Nevada in term of solar installations. I think thi wa the strongest year ever for them.O'Reilly:It' also fun for them, becaus there' three power grid nation in the Unit States. There' the Eastern grid, the Western grid, and Texas.Muckerman:I had no idea.O'Reilly:They have their own power grid.Muckerman:I wonder who negoti that.O'Reilly:Well, think about the Texa mentality. ""We could have been our own countri if we want to.""Muckerman:Could have been. They probabl will one day. Who knows? But yeah, you'r look at 77% of all the solar that wa instal in Q3. Q3 wa twice as big as Q2 of 2016, in term of installations, and three time as big as Q3 of 2015, so year over year, three time more in term of solar power capac wa instal in Q3. You'r look at great expect for Q4. We haven't seen those result out yet. But, about three-quart of the Q3 instal were of the utility-scal variety. So that mean you'r look at potenti compani likeFirst SolarorSunPowerr benefit there.O'Reilly:Th price drop thi past year. A lot of the solar stock you'r talk about just now, their stock aren't do that great becaus they'r have to cut price because, at the end of the day, it' a hardwar commodity. Thi is what happen with computers. If memori serves, the price of these solar cell were drop 10% to 20% last year. Thi isn't surpris at all.Muckerman:Yeah, they'r down big, and obvious the market is respond by increas the demand. You'r see the pariti start to creep up in term of it cost the same or less to use solar power.O'Reilly:So I do need to ask, becaus it lend itself to what we were talk about befor -- the switch from coal to natur ga is obvious awesome, lower emissions, etc. Should natur ga be worri now?Muckerman:Becaus of solar power and wind power? No, I don't think so. Right now, you'r look at natur ga be the baseload provider.O'Reilly:Becaus you do need it overnight. The sun sets.Muckerman:In term of aggregate, I'm pretti sure natur ga is --O'Reilly:Her to stay.Muckerman:-- multipl abov solar and wind right now. That be said, they'r catch up. You are talk about doubl and tripl growth quarter over quarter, year over year. That' pretti meaningful. And I don't realli see it slow down. If you talk about reduc cost and util scale, that' what it' go after.O'Reilly:They'r get efficient, too. The cheap cell are, like, 19% effici now. Which, 10 year ago, 10% effici wa a big deal. The more expens super-qu cell are in the 23% effici ranges. It' get good, if you want to do someth like this.Muckerman:And I don't know how mani home there are in the Unit States, but enough solar capac wa installed, supposedly, they'r predicting, onc they get Q4 numbers.O'Reilly:I think there' 110, 120 million households. I'm talk about censu data. I could be wrong. I don't know how mani hous that is, becaus you have singl peopl in there, too.Muckerman:Yeah. So, arguably, you have a long way to go. But in 2016 alone, they estim that enough wa instal to power 2.3 million homes. That' a pretti decent number.O'Reilly:I wa go to guess 1 million. That' high. Wow, cool. Gosh, is there ani way for us to make money off of this?Muckerman:Well, I think we had a podcast sponsor a while back, I think it wa someth like a way to invest in --O'Reilly:Oh, Wunder Capital.Muckerman:Wund Capital, yeah, a way to invest in a portfolio of solar.O'Reilly:Y could also say the solar yieldcos.Muckerman:Or you just look out for solar, SunPower, SolarC -- well, I guess [Tesla Motors](NASDAQ: TSLA) now, becaus SolarC is no longer public.O'Reilly:Y have these facilities, and they'r use to make solar cell at certain costs, and they'r the older cell now that are be outmoded, so they'r current switch over to the higher-effici ones. So I think the next year or two for the solar guy is go to be rough, but long-term, I think if they can keep up with the efficiencies, they'll be OK.Muckerman:Yeah. And if you want to check out that articl Sean mentioned, it' by Travi Hoium, publish in the middl of December, titl ""U.S. Solar Record Installations: The Futur Is Get Brighter for Clean Energy,"" and I can't think of anybodi better to read than Travi Hoium if you want to learn about solar.O'Reilly:Yeah, on fool.com, he' our solar guy right now.Muckerman:A long as I'v been at the Fool, he' been cover that industry, not exclusively, but I would place that 75%-85% of hi time is spent on solar.O'Reilly:Yeah, that and hark on Tesla. We love you, Travis.Muckerman:And now Tesla' part of the solar regim with their acquisit of SolarCity, the Gigafactori is up and running, onli around 15%-20% capacity.O'Reilly:Yeah, I got a push notif yesterday, I wa like, ""You didn't tell us, what?""Muckerman:They'r produc lithium batteries, and then the Powerwall, which they'r sell --O'Reilly:That' the trick, of course, with solar and wind -- how do you store thi energy, if you don't need it right then?Muckerman:Tesla might be on the way to figur it out, at least for the residenti side of the business.O'Reilly:Sweet.

5 Stocks Millennials Should Buy in 2017,1/15/2017,"Millenni have one of the most import thing in invest on their side: time.Bi start to invest long befor retirement, millenni can take a veri long-term view of their investments. And at The Motley Fool, a long-term view is what we'r all about. With that in mind, here are five stock that are attract for ani millennial' portfolio.makeArticleAd();Imag source: Getti Images.SquareOn of the broad trend I think we can expect to continu for decad to come is a grow number of mobil transactions.Squar Inc(NYSE: SQ) is a leader in mobil transact for businesses, and with Squar Cash ha becom a leader in peer-to-p transact as well.Squar is lose money today, but the compani is grow like crazi and margin are start to improve, as you can see below.SQ Revenu (TTM)data byYChartsTh great thing about Squar is that it' build a busi that will be the foundat on which thousand of other small busi will be built. With payment processing, point of sale solutions, payroll, and other offer Squar is make it easier to build a busi and oper it on mobil platforms, someth millenni probabl interact with on a regular basis.Whol FoodsMillenni didn't start the organ food trend, but they'r take it to a new level. It isn't necessarili that they want food to be healthier than other gener have, but how food is made and what' in it is more import to millenni than ever before. That' been a big driver ofWhol Foods'(NASDAQ: WFM) success over the past decade, someth that I think will continu as millenni get older and more start buy their own groceries.It' true that Whole Foods' stock price ha dip over the past year as growth ha slow and profit sank. But the fall in the stock price mean share trade at a much more reason 20x earn than the ratio' peak in the 60 a few year ago.WFMdata byYChartsWhat Whole Food is ride is a long-term trend toward food that' more transpar and more human produc than previou gener have demanded. It' no longer the onli player in the market, but it' still the biggest fish, and is uniqu posit to becom a go-to groceri store for million of millenni for decad to come.Gener MotorsTesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) may be the easi auto pick for millenni investors, butGener Motors(NYSE: GM) is the better invest long-term. Not onli ha GM gener more than twice as much net incom over the past year ($13.9 billion) as Tesla gener in revenu ($5.9 billion) -- in some ways, it' ahead of the EV upstart on technology.GM bought a9% stake in ride share compani Lyft in 2016and recent bought Cruis Autom to advanc it self-driv car technolog as well. So GM is alreadi ahead of Tesla in the ride share business, and is arguabl on equal foot in self drive technology.Wher GM ha realli jump ahead of competitor is with the Chevi Bolt. The all-electr EV with a 238 mile rang and price tag under $30,000 (after the feder tax credit) beat Tesla' Model 3 to the road and will like have about a year head start in deliveries.It may be excit to talk about Tesla as a futur power in the auto industry, but GM is far more establish and is execut on a strateg shift that will make the compani relev for decad to come. For long-term investors, that' where I would put my money today.SunPowerIf there' one trend that will chang the world more than ani other dure the lifetim of millennials, I think it' solar energy. Fossil fuel have long power everyth from our home to our cars, but it' energi from the sun that' actual our most abund energi resource, provid the earth with enough energi everi hour to provid all of the world' energi consumpt need for an entir year.SunPower(NASDAQ: SPWR) is the most effici solar panel manufactur in the world, and ha exposur to nearli everi segment of the solar market around the world. Everyth from small, handheld solar cell to the largest power plant in the world are power by SunPow solar cells, and that give the compani a uniqu posit from which to grow into the multi-trillion dollar energi market.What' encourag for millenni buy now is that the growth is just beginning. Subsidi no longer drive the adopt of solar energy, with SunPow win bid in Chile, Mexico, and Nevada that provid cost effici energi more cheapli than fossil fuels. And with fall cost we will see volum grow long-term. Thi is a volatil market, but if you have a decad or two to wait, SunPow is well posit to take advantag of the boom solar market.NikeConsci about health and fit is almost a standard among millenni today. Whether it' bike to work or take yoga classes, athlet gear is go to be a stapl for the entir generation. AndNike(NYSE: NKE) is a compani that' proven to have stay power in the athlet business.Nik ha proven it abil to stay relev as style have changed, but it' their sale model that I think demonstr whi they'r built to last. Sure, you can buy Nike product from most retailers, but the compani is a master at deal directli with custom through digit market and direct onlin sales. Thi cut out all middlemen and will lead to more inform on what custom want and higher profit long-term. And as you build your portfolio, that' a great trend to be follow in retail.10 stock we like better than Wal-MartWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

9 Facts You Didn't Know About Driverless Cars,1/15/2017,"Imag source: Getti Images.Technolog and automot compani are current in a sprint to bring the best (and the safest) self-driv technolog to market. The compani have been spur on by high traffic fatalities, increas support by governments, and, of course, new revenu potential.makeArticleAd();Th pace at which driverless car technolog advanc is astounding, which mean that most of us have probabl miss a few key develop if we haven't been keep up lately. Check out these nine fact to help bring your driverless car knowledg back up to speed:Google' Waymo just cut the cost of LIDAR by 90%.Alphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Googl recent spun out it self-driv busi into it own company, call Waymo, and thi month it announc that it hasreduc the costof the LIDAR technology, which is use to help self-driv car see what' around them. Accord toArsTechnica, Waymo may have reduc the price from $75,000 down to $7,500.2018 is the year to watch.Electric-car makerTesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) releas a video a coupl of month ago show a person ride around in a Tesla -- in Autopilot mode -- with the car complet in command. Tesla start ad fulli autonom hardwar to it car a few month ago and say it'll activ roll out softwar updat to bring full autonomi to it vehicl after they go through more testing. But CEO Elon Musk ha said he want Tesla to have a fulli autonom vehicl on the road by 2018.Mar rover technolog might find it way into driverless cars.At the Consum Electron Show thi month,Nissan Motor Co.(NASDAQOTH: NSANY)announc that it want to implement NASA technolog use for the Mar rover to help control fleet of self-driv cars. Nissan' Seamless Autonom Mobil (SAM) system allow a self-driv car to call on a person for help if the car doesn't know what to do (for example, if it need to interpret hand signal from a traffic officer). The vehicl would call SAM in such a situation, and a person would map out a quick rout around the problem area. Other self-driv car would then learn from these situat to improv their own drive knowledge. NASA use a similar system, call Visual Environ for Remot Virtual Explor (VERVE), for the Mar rover and other vehicles, which involv human map out rout around obstacl when the rover couldn't figur out what to do on it own.Driverless car will make you a better driver.Chipmak and driverless car tech leaderNVIDIACorporation(NASDAQ: NVDA) recent announc it new artifici intellig (AI) Co-Pilot system that use extern camera and radar to tell you what' around (such as a bicyclist), and intern camera that keep track of where you'r looking. The AI Co-Pilot will drive the car by itself most of the time, but will use it data to also help human learn how to drive better when they'r control the wheel.Self-driv vehicl will be big business.Boston Consult Group estim that the driverless car market will be worth $77 billion by 2035. Not all of that will come from sale of the vehicl themselves, though. Mani companies, like Waymo, plan on make money from self-driv ride-hail services.Not everyon is a fan of the technology.An advocaci group for profession drivers, call the Upstat Transport Association, is tri to get New York toban self-driv carsfor 50 years. The organ want to protect the job of profession drivers, though a 50-year ban seem a bit extrem (won't the AI robot have taken over by then?). So far, New York' state govern appear open to self-driv technolog on it roads. But the state doe have a requir for driver to keep one hand on the wheel that self-driv oppon are hope can be use to ban the tech.Driverless car might make traffic worse, initially.A new studi by the U.K. Depart for Transport found that traffic would actuallyget worseon Britain' road when driverless car take to the streets, becaus the vehicl will be too cautiou at first. When a quarter of all car are automated, the govern agenc expect road delay to tick up by 0.9%, and the percentag won't go down until about 50% to 75% of all car are fulli autonomous.Ther will be slow, but steady, growth.One-quart of all car will be autonom by 2040, accord the Brook Institution. AndIHSbeliev we'll reach driverless car ubiqu sometim after 2050.China could lead the autonomous-vehicl market.China is tri to revamp it truck industri by allow compani to test out self-driv technolog at afast pacethan mani other countries. The lack of regul in the countri mean that China is in a posit to roll out self-driv tech faster, though it rais the question of whether acceler develop of the technolog come at the expens of safety.Fin thoughtsWhil there are certainli concern around self-driv cars, there' virtual no stop thi technolog now. Automakers, tech companies, and govern are all eager to bring autonom drive to the masses, and we'r like to see the pace of innov pick up over the come years.10 stock we like better than Tesla MotorsWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Audi describ it shape as ""an eleg altern to the robust presence"" of a typic big SUV.It is that. The Q8 Concept is big, with high sides. But up close it seem well scaled, not enorm -- despit it veri big wheel (23 inches) and tires. Inside, it' spacious, with an attract design and Audi' usual top-notch materi and fit and finish.

Why Hawaii Is Becoming the Proving Ground for the Future of Energy Storage,1/14/2017,"The island of Hawaii are known for their gorgeou landscap and world famou beaches, but they'r probabl not the first place you think of when you think of renew energy. But they should be.Hawaii is the first state in the U.S. where rooftop solar ha becom an almost standard item on home and businesses, someth I person wit recent drive around the island of O'ahu and Kaua'i. Solar panel are also in place unthink in other locations. They face north, they'r cover by trees, and some look like they'r bare attach to the roof itself. But Hawaiian find solar to be so econom that almost all solar make sense, and they are increasingli find energi storag an econom solut as well. Understand just how energi storag is work here can help us understand whi compani are prove their technolog of the futur on the Hawaiian Islands.makeArticleAd();Imag source: Getti Images.Island energi doesn't look like continent U.S. energyOn average, U.S. residenti consum pay 12.45 cent per kWh for electricity. Price vari by state in the continent U.S., from 9.33 cent per kWh in Louisiana to 19.95 cent per kWh in Connecticut, but the price in the lower 48 state pale in comparison to those in Hawaii.Accord to the EIA, in Octob 2016 residenti electr price in Hawaii were 27.54 cent per kWh, and on the island of Kaua'i rate are 32.78 per kWh start thi year. That make solar extrem viabl given the fact that power purchas agreement for residenti project can be found for less than $0.13 per kWh. Util contract are go for less than $0.05 per kWh. And the differ mean energi storag can make financi sens as well.Big invest be made on Kaua'iSolarC andTesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) were the first big investor in Kaua'i, build a 13 MW solar plant and 52 MWh batteri system. They combin with 24 MW of exist solar power to provid as much as 13 MW of power to the grid dure evening' peak hour of 5 p.m. to 10 p.m. The report price per kWh of electr from the Tesla/SolarC system wa 14.5 cent per kWh.Thi week, AE Corp announc a deal to build a 28 MW solar farm with a 100 MWh batteri system attached. Thi time, electr will be sold to KIUC for 11 cent per kWh. When completed, Kaua'i will get over 50% of it electr from renew sources.In less than a year and a half between the Tesla/SolarC deal and the AE deal, the cost of solar+storag fell 30%. And it shouldn't go unnot that the price of electr is now below the retail rate most consum pay in the continent U.S. Hawaii is prove that a 100% renew energi futur is not onli possible, it' closer than you might think.Island are the new prove groundsSunPower(NASDAQ: SPWR) won a bid to build a similar system in the French West Indi and Corsica. The compani will build 20.7 MW of solar power plant on the island and five project total 18.4 MW of solar power that will includ energi storage.Island around the world reli on burn diesel for electricity, so they'r take notic to the fall cost of solar+storage.Solar+storag is the next big energi trendSolar energi contract in the U.S. are now below $0.05 per kWh, and by the end of 2017 we should see contract below $0.04 per kWh. So solar energi is competit with new fossil fuel plant on a per unit of energi basis. But the intermitt of renew is still a challenge, someth batteri can help address.What Kaua'i is show is that combin solar with energi storag can creat an econom energi combin that can suppli electr beyond the hour the sun is out. The cost of $0.11 per kWh is econom for a Hawaiian island, and with consist cost reduct over the next decad it could be econom for some state in the U.S. as well. And as solar+storag becom a veri real option for utilities, businesses, and homeown it will chang the way we think about energi forever.10 stock we like better than Tesla MotorsWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

This Week in Solar,1/13/2017,"Normally, thi is the weekli recap where I cover the break news from solar compani around the world, from new project sign to bankruptcies. But thi week, the industry' focu ha been on a much bigger picture: polici and advocacy. From California to Washington D.C., investor will want to buckl in for a wild ride in the solar energi space over the next few years.Imag source: Getti Images.makeArticleAd();California may make solar mandatoryAt the start of 2017, San Francisco made solar energi mandatori for all new build that are 10 stori or fewer. And the elect of Scott Wiener, the author of that bill, to the state senat hasbrought the idea to the Capitol. Wiener ha brought a summari propos for legisl that would take the mandat statewide, which could end up in full legisl form within a coupl of months.Mand solar on new build would be a huge boost for the solar industry, but it would have an ancillari benefit of be much cheaper than solar through tradit sale channels. Sale and market cost have proven to be veri high for solar becaus sale staff often have to visit each home individually.Tesla Motors'(NASDAQ: TSLA) SolarCity, in particular, ha had to lower it instal guidanc multipl time over the past year, and cost have spike becaus sale are becom more difficult.But know that new build have to have solar would help lower sale costs, and have the cost of solar roll into a mortgag would lower financ costs, as well. The result should be a combin of lower cost for solar buyer and/or higher margin for installers. What compani will want to do next is partner with builder to effici sell their systems, which is where it' notabl thatSunPower(NASDAQ: SPWR) alreadi ha partnership with seven of the 10 largest homebuild in the country. That could be an advantag if the California mandat passes.Th solar industry' biggest voic may be Presid ObamaSolar energi ha grown by leap and bound over the last eight years, increas from 1.3 GW instal in 2008 to an expect 14.1 GW in 2016. And investor have to keep in mind that subsidi and polici at the federal, state, and local level have help drive that growth.Along with fall costs, the feder invest tax credit, state renew mandates, and polici likePURPAhav help drive the industri forward. The concern within the industri is that the new presidenti administr and Congress will tear down some of that support. One of the biggest support of solar energy, Presid Obama, happen to be in the White Hous for a few more days, and he recent made a compel case for more invest in the futur in aSciencearticl titled, ""The irrevers momentum of clean energy,"" say in part:Thi should not be a partisan issue. It is good busi and good econom to lead a technolog revolut and defin market trends. And it is smart plan to set long-term emission-reduct target and give American companies, entrepreneurs, and investor certainti so they can invest [in] and manufactur the emission-reduc technolog that we can use domest and export to the rest of the world.Polici matter in the solar industry, and to maintain favor polici that will drive futur growth, the industri need to have a posit messag to sell to all Americans. Presid Obama may emerg as the loudest voic for the industry, and the messag he outlin abov is as good as anyon can ask for, no matter which way you lean politically.Th biggest rooftop solar system in the worldTesla' Gigafactori will break a lot of records, but one import one will be the fact that it' expect to instal the biggest rooftop solar system in the world, at 70 MW. That' about seven time the second-largest array anywher els in the world.If the plant is go to get 100% of it energi from renew energy, the roof is a good place to start. Thi also like will be a prove ground for SolarCity' solar panel that will be produc in Buffalo, New York.Tesla is certainli put it money where it mouth is when it come to renew energy. And power what will eventu be the biggest factori in the world with renew energi is a big endors of Tesla' overal vision of the future. Solar energi is liter go to help keep the light on.10 stock we like better than Tesla MotorsWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Don’t Sweat Analysts’ Unenthused Response to Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Battery Factory,1/13/2017,"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsEarli thi week,Tesla Motor Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) final put it ballyhoo gigafactori into motion, begin the product oflithium-ion batteri in Sparks, Nevadain front of a crowd of a few hundr interest parties. TSLA stock soar on the heel of the event, of course, jump nearli 5% the day it offici flip the switch to ""on,"" and then continu to rally. Indeed, Tesla stock ha ralli 27% sinc earli November, mostli in anticip of the mileston event.Source: ShutterstockAnd yet, while the market and most retail investor were clearli impressed, more than a hand of analyst weren't. Their concerns?makeArticleAd();A lack of fiscal detail about how the batteri plant will impact the company' books, for one. Anoth worri wa about the sheer cost of the facil itself. Still anoth wa whether the Model 3 may not be profit when it final goe into production.With all due respect to those professionals, you want to start worri about these thing now?Now?!?Yes. No. Maybe.Just for the record, yes, I'm the same guy who' been more critic than construct on Tesla Motor over the year (likehere,hereandhere).7 ""New Industrial"" Stock to Bore You to the BankBut, my pessim wa never to suggest that Tesla' take on electr vehicl wasn't game-changing. The companyhasmainstream EVs. It carsareengin marvels. My concern were simpli root in the notion that most investor had unrealist expectations; the mass couldn't distinguish between Tesla Motor be a trade or an investment.In retrospect, it' not clear if the analyst commun wa abl to distinguish between the two either.Tak the comment from Goldman Sach analyst David Tamberrino as an example.H said, follow Tuesday' event at the facility:""Overal we found the tour help in illustr the layout and process for manufactur lithium ion batteri cell and pack for it automot and energi products. However, there wa a lack of quantit updat for 2017 and the ramp expectations.""Fair enough. Just bear in mind, however, that Goldmanupgrad Tesla stock to a ""buy"" in May of last year- when the batteri factori wa well underway - with analyst Patrick Archambault comment ""We do not believ Tesla share are fulli captur the company' disrupt potential.""So … is Tesla ani less disrupt now that it' make it own batteri en masse? The stock isn't ani higher now than it wa then, but Goldman' current rate on TSLA is ""neutral.""Granted, Goldman wa just day away from underwrit anoth secondari offer of TSLA stock in May but the compani didn't know anylessabout the math of the gigafactori than it know now. The onli real differ between then and now is the stock' price.Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jona wa also worri about Tesla' lack of fiscal detail now that the factori is in production, just as much as he' worri that anoth round of fundrais is in the cards. Again, however, that' noth new for Tesla Motors, and it wasn't a problem for Jona back in 2014 when he doubl Morgan Stanley' price target on TSLA stock, to $320 per share.H notedat the time:""If it can be a leader in commerci batteri packs, investor may never look at Tesla the same way again … Tesla say it will team up with partner to build the world' largest Li-ion batteri pack facil in the US. We reflect the potenti for lower batteri cost through higher sale volum nearli doubl Tesla' share of the global car market to 90bp by 2028, drive our target increase.""Teslaisclearli go to have that ""world' largest Li-ion batteri pack facility"" Jona wa stoke about three year ago. And, there' at least alittlemor clariti now than there wa then. Yet, Morgan Stanley' current rate on Tesla stock is a modest ""equal weight"" despit clear progress be made sinc the 2014 call that said such progress would be compelling.Th stock never even threaten to reach $320.And that' when it hit you … some (though not all) analyst are just take their best guess on TSLA, beingl byth rhetor rather thanleadingth rhetoric.To be fair, that' what analyst do.And it' not easy.Opinion should be updat as new inform surfaces.On the other hand, the ebb and flow between quantit and qualit analysi from some analyst ha made it tough for investor to digest those profession insights. The thing that didn't matter befor - like profit or perpetu fund-rais - can't be too big of a deal for the stock now.Here' Where Appl Inc. (AAPL) Domin Holiday SalesIn other words, don't sweat the naysayers' opinion too much.Bottom Line for TSLA StockNon of thi is to suggest TSLA is inevit go to skyrocket higher, nor is it to impli Tesla stock is doomed; the actual outcom is apt to be somewher in between the two extrem opinions. It' simpli to point out that of all the reason you may want to worri about own Tesla shares, the lacklust respons from analyst regard the gigafactori is the least of them. Those guy are larg expect to say someth in respons to mileston events, and mani of the pessimist comment were off-the-cuff sound bite not meant to be taken as a complet analysis.A of thi writing, Jame Brumley did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlace10 Dividend Growth Stock That Simpli Print Money7 Cheap Stock to Buy That Could Doubl in 2017The postDon't Sweat Analysts' Unenthus Respons to Tesla Motor Inc (TSLA) Batteri Factoryappear first onInvestorPlace."

At first, and up until recently, it wa move in that direct by openingd novostor and by roll up small organ groceri stores. The key point, however, is that WFM wa not sell commodit products. It wa sell special products, which meant it wa build itself into the primari supplier of those product - organ and ""responsible"" food.WFM Stock StumblesHowever, in the past coupl of years, everyon ha gotten into the organ game. Grocer of everi stripe,Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.(NYSE:WMT), and even the dollar store start sell organics.10 Stock That Will Hurt Your Retirement, Not Help ItOriginally, I thought that thi would not present ani real competit to WFM. My faulti assumpt wa that the Whole Food shopper wa loyal to Whole Foods, and had no reason to shop anywher else. WFM patron fit a certain upscal demographic.Wher I went wrong wa that organ have effectivelybecomecommoditized. You can find organ chicken and meat and veget and fruit in just about ani larg groceri store. It doesn't matter if it is ""lower quality"" organ or not compar to WFM. The point is that label someth ""organic"" is evid enough to the gener consumer.With organ now commoditized, the Whole Food shopper no longer ha loyalty, as we would expect of a commod business. Thus, consum have bail on the substanti higher price of Whole Food and deign to visit the regular groceri store more often. The result ha led to lower same-stor sales, and other struggl for WFM stock.Cost have also gotten more pain for Whole Food stock. Even though revenu rose almost 11% from fiscal year 2014 to FY16, oper incom fell from $934 million to $857 million, a nearli 300-basis-point drop in gross margins. Net incom fell from $579 million to $507 million, with margin declin almost 200 bps.The good news is that both oper and free cash flow have remain rel unchanged, at about $1.1 billion and $800 million, respectively. However, the compani rais a billion dollar in debt in earli 2016, for the worst of all possibl reasons: to repurchas shares. I hate this. I absolut hate it.Instead of figur out how to grow the busi and find traction, Whole Food is buy WFM stock that is trade at 19.7x FY16 earn while net incom is stagnant or falling. WFM thu goe from a compani with no long-term debt to one with a billion dollar in debt, pay 5% interest and steal about 10% of profit to servic debt.Tesla Motor Inc (TSLA) Stock Is Risky, Pricey and Absolut RightThat' whi I don't think you should invest in Whole Food stock. It' no longer an invest with a clear, long-term vision provid by management.So you trade it. If you look at the one-year chart, you'll see WFM stock ha been in a trade rang between $28 and $35. I would say to buy it under $30 and flip it abov $33 to be safe. For more aggress traders, you could short it abov $33 and cover under $30. In both cases, however, set a 5%-7% stop loss.Lawr Meyer is the CEO of PDL Capital, and manag of the forthcomingLiberti Portfolio stock newsletter.

Why Rooftop Solar Stocks Plunged in 2016,1/10/2017,"Imag source: Getti Images.Aft a decad of rocket growth, 2016 wa a veri tough year for the rooftop solar industry. Growth slow dramat and the introduct of the loan as a viabl financ option upend the lease/pow purchas agreement (PPA) model that' driven the industri to where it is today.makeArticleAd();Vivint Solar Inc.(NYSE: VSLR) andSunrun(NASDAQ: RUN) both end the year down more than 50%, and befor be bought out byTesla Motor Inc.(NASDAQ: TSLA) , SolarCity' stock wa down 60%. The challeng head into 2017 is that the pressur rooftop solar is face aren't go to get ani easier.RUNdata byYCharts.Whi growth disappear in 2016The big shock of the past year ha been the massiv slowdown in residenti solar growth. The extens of the Invest Tax Credit ha given the industri stabil in feder subsidies, but it' also remov the urgenc of instal solar. And with cost continu to decline, it may make sens for custom to wait rather than instal rooftop solar today.Accord to SEIA/GTM Research'sU.S. Solar Market Insight Report, third-quart residenti solar instal were up just 2% from a year ago and fell 10% sequentially. The industri overal ha had to adjust by cut costs, particularli in sale and marketing, and by focus more on the profit custom who are left.Compound the growth challeng is the fact that custom no longer see sign a 20-year PPA/leas attract given the low cost of instal and greater avail of loans, which wa a shock to Vivint's, Sunrun's, and SolarCity' busi models.Financ chang courseTh rooftop solar industri wa built on third-parti financ in the form of PPA and leases. Solar compani were abl to use tax benefit more effici than custom and could get better financ terms, mainli becaus bank didn't know how to financ one-off rooftop solar systems. But as the industri ha grown and cost have come down, the tax benefit have becom easier for homeown to use and bank have begun to offer financ solutions.Imag source: Getti Images.Thi trend toward loan took hold in 2016 and threw the industri into turmoil. Region instal began take market share from industri leader Vivint, SolarCity, and Sunrun becaus they were more flexibl in financ offerings. The larger instal had to respond by offer their own loan products, but that highlight that their entir organiz structur were built for third-parti leasing, not compet for custom base on price alon (enabl by loans).W still don't know how the financ chang will shake out in the solar industry, but it' fair to say that much of the competit advantag the public solar compani had go into 2016 diminish dure the year. Now, region instal are develop their growth strategi and larger compani have to find a new way to differenti themselv to stay alive.How solar instal can adaptOff loan isn't inher a problem for ani solar installer. In a way, it can be a posit becaus instead of take the financ risk onto the balanc sheet, the risk goe to the bank provid the loan and the instal get cash up front.What' challeng is differenti yourself when nearli everi instal is use the same equipment. Price becom the biggest differentiator, and that will lead to lower margin in the long term.Th best plan for instal is to find a way to differenti base on effici or ancillari offer like energi storag or energi manag products. Tesla' plant under construct in Buffalo, New York, intend to make high-effici solar panel in an intent to squeez more energi out of each roof. Vivint and Sunrun could partner with a manufactur likeLGorKyocera, for example, to do the same.Energi storag isn't econom in most state today, but it' get close. Build the infrastructur and softwar behind energi storag and manag could be a differenti tough for region instal to match.Effici and energi storag are two way publicli trade solar instal can start to differenti themselves, so look for progress on that front in 2017.An uncertain futur for rooftop solarWhat' clear is that in 2016 the rooftop solar busi got a lot more difficult and a lot less profit for Vivint Solar, Sunrun, and Tesla' SolarCity. And the challeng they'r face won't get easier in 2017 unless they can develop a sustain differentiation. That may be easier said than done.10 stock we like better than Tesla MotorsWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

3 Strong Stocks to Invest in the Driverless-Car Race,1/10/2017,"Driverless-car stock are rev up for a record-break year. If you'r on the hunt for a pure play on the trend, though, you'r out of luck. There are essenti no publicli trade compani deal exclus in driverless cars. But at The Motley Fool, we'r alway on the lookout for creativ invest angles. Here are three driverless-car stock that let you invest in the technology, the car, and the data for the driverless-car revolution.1. MobilEy -- The technologyMobilEy Co-Found and CTO Amnon Shashua. Imag source: BMW.makeArticleAd();Jerusalem-basedMobilEye(NYSE: MBLY) is as pure a play as they come for driverless-car stocks. It manufactur the camera for advanc driver assist system in approxim 220 car models. In July, MobilEy announc apartnershipwithBMWandIntelto develop an autonomous-vehicl platform by 2021. Just a month later, it went even further when it announc a partnership with auto supplierDelphi Automotiveto develop a""plug-and-play"" self-driv platformavail for ani automak to adopt by 2017.MobilEy seem to be pois for profit -- it just announc a 34% year-over-year quarterli revenu increas and pride itself on an asset-light busi model. For investors, thi signal both a buy opportun and a valuat warning. It stock jump 27% after the recent news and ha waver back and forth over the past few year alongsid industry-level bullish and stock-specif announcements. Investor in MobilEy should be bullish on the commodit of driverless technolog and have a long-term perspect to weather the up and down that will probabl continue.MBLYdata byYCharts.2. Tesla Motor -- The carImag source: Tesla Motors.Tesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) is not a driverless-car stock, but it is vehement in it belief that autom is the automot future. All it vehicl come equip with Autopilot, a technolog that Tesla founder and CEO Elon Musk say will allow Tesla to drive themselv across the countri by (hopefully) 2018. As a first major adopt of semi-autonom driving, Tesla ha experienc setbacks, most notabl a driver fatal last May.A Tesla Motor stock invest allow investor to get behind the wheel of an already-sc semi-driverless carl, someth that no other compani can offer. But Tesla is also much more than a driverless-car stock. The compani is, first and foremost, a (driver-filled) car company. It recent $2 billion merger with SolarC also make it a solar company, an industri with substanti regulatori unknown of it own. The compani is bet on signific synergi by packag solar rooftop with car sales, but these major move have kept mani investor on the fenc about it future. For Tesla to make the driverless-car stock list, investor need to be sure they'r bullish on it entir business.3. Alphabet -- The dataVideo source: Waymo viaYoutube.Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) , the parent compani of Google, ha been make major move in the driverless-car space. The compani ha spent more than $60 million to bump human out of the driver' seat, and last October, it announc that it had clock a whop 2 million road mile on it autonom vehicles. Last month, Alphabet went a step further by redefin it autom effort as a full-fledg spinoff busi dub Waymo, rather than one of it prototyp ""moonshot"" projects.Alphabet and Waymo have made clear that they'r not interest in car manufacturing, a hat tip to other such as BMW that are alreadi well entrench in thi space. Instead, it will focu on take what it' learn from it cute ""panda car"" prototyp and transfer it to commerci cars, such as the 100ChryslerPacifica Hybrid minivan that are set to join Waymo' fleet in earli 2017. Waymo ha a strong technolog advantag over mani competitors, but where it truli shine is it access to and refin of data. Self-driv car risk be aimless wander without enough inform about their surroundings, and Alphabet ha more inform about the world than anyon else, and is continu to learn how best to use it in the quest for an autonom vehicle.With an Alphabet investment, investor need to understand that driverless car are not one slice of thi company' pie -- they'r a crumb. With Alphabet' $550 billion market cap, Waymo' minuscul $60 million fleet of panda and minivan is not what thi company' count on to drive profit in the year to come. But Waymo is yet anoth exampl of how Alphabet is capit on it core competit advantag in way that were not previous expect -- and if that' what you'r interest in invest in, then Alphabet may be the driverless-car stock for you.Ped to the metal?With driverless-car technolog still in it infancy, it can be tempt to take a backseat to invest in thi industry. But for risk-toler investor with a long-term perspective, get in on the ground floor of a driverless-car stock might be the best way to snag major return in the year to come, whether it' by invest in the technology, the car, or the data.10 stock we like better than Wal-MartWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Other player in the space includ the ventur capit unit ofAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG,NASDAQ:GOOGL), andNvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA), who build chip to support autonom vehicl capabilities.I Tesla Too Ambitious?Ther is certainli an argument to be made that Tesla is too ambitious. Musk ha spoken about produc a million car by 2020, and it gigafactori is said to cost as much as $5 billion, though other partner and supplier will share in the expense.SolarC is thought to be cash flow neutral when it is offici fold in dure the last quarter of 2016.

Why Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA) Stock Is a Survivor,1/10/2017,"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsWheth it' good news or bad news forAlibaba Group Hold Ltd(NYSE:BABA) sharehold remain to be seen, but the e-commerc giant is final start to crack down on the counterfeit merchandis that' a littl too easi to buy (usual unknowingly) through it online-shop sites. Last week, the Chines e-tail su two vendor for sell fake Swarovski watches.Th upsid to the valu of BABA stock is that with thi offici anti-bootlegged-brand stance, Alibaba' e-commerc site gain more credibl as a venu … among consum as well as vendors.makeArticleAd();Th downsid is, a big chunk of Alibaba stock wa built on sale of low-cost counterfeit goods. On balanc though, there' not quit as much risk to BABA stock in the company' newest posit on fakes.BABA: Enough Is EnoughAni statist that describ the amount of fake merchandis avail via Alibaba' e-commerc platform should be taken with a grain of salt; nobodi truli knows. That hasn't prevent counterfeit watchdog NetNam from take a guess though; it believ anywherebetween 20% and 80%of the good sold via Alibaba' Taoboa aren't actual made by the compani their logos, look and tag are suppos to imply.NetNames' suggest rang of fake merchandis sold by Alibaba is admittedli wide, but that dispar underscor the complex of the problem. Even if the real number is somewher in the middl though, at 50%, that' still 50% too much.Th 10 Best Stock to Buy for 2017: The Experts' PicksIt' an issu that ha nag BABA stock holder for years, though it ha becom a much more seriou concern over the cours of the past year or so. In fact, the problem of knock-off becam so preval that Gucci parent compani Kere SA file a suit against Alibaba in mid-2015, claim that not onli did the compani not do enough to prevent counterfeit good from be sold at it website, but thatAlibaba actual encourag it.Ker SA' suit wa just a microcosm of how other brand name felt at the time.Th lawsuit, along with pressur from Chines regulators, appear to get CEO Jack Ma' attention,fin prompt him to say,""There' no ceil for invest in fight fake goods"" earli last year. Littl chang in the month that followed, however. Indeed, Ma wa almost defiant of the backlash in June of last year,saying:""Th problem is that the fake product today, they make better quality, better price than the real products, the real names…. It' not the fake product that destroy them [the real design make authent goods], it' the new busi models.""H may well be right, but it' not a philosophi that fli with regul or brand-names.Th ongo pressur seem to have final sunk in, though. That, or the fact that the Offic of the Unit State Trade Repres offici (onc again)blacklist Taobao in Decemberseem to have gotten Ma' attention. Last week,Alibaba file lawsuitsagainst two of it merchant for knowingli sell counterfeit goods. Presumably, the compani will continu to file suit until it make the point that fake good won't be toler at it e-commerc venue.Or, will it?Impact on Alibaba StockIt' easi to make exampl of two vendor when there are thousand more that may or may not notice, or care. If Ma want to make a statement that matters, he'll need to take aim more often, with a bigger gun.And therein lie the rub … it' not clear to what extent Ma actual want to crack down on the sale of fake good at the Taobao website.In the same sense, it' imposs to determin exactli how much of the merchandis sold via Alibaba site is counterfeit; it' imposs to determin how much busi may be lost (and not won back with sale of authent goods) should Alibaba crimp down on bootleg brands. But, if fake merchandis account for half the good sold by the e-commerc giant, such measur may not actual be good for business, or for BABA stock.And ""half"" may be a gener estimate. In Januari of last year, China' State Administr for Industri and Commerc releas a studi it had commissionedsuggest that onli 37% of the merchandis avail on Taobao wa genuine.It' in that light that the underpin of the lawsuit may not be as heartfelt as the more visibl suggest of them is. As Nissan' William Forsythecom late last year, ""They are count the money with their left hand, and cover their eye with their right.""To that end, it' not clear if Chines regul are entir on board with the premis either.Counterfeit is almost a $400 billion industri in China, account for roughli 12% of it exports. Alibaba is a big reason that industri ha manag to grow at a time the nation desper need more job to meet it growth goals. If Taobao can't sell a big chunk of those goods, the rippl effect could be significant.Fortunately, there' more bark than bite with the most recent anti-counterfeit showmanship.Bottom Line for BABA StockFor better or worse, Ma isn't terribl seriou about quell sale of sham good via Taobao. It' one of those thing where consum - most of them anyway - quietli know the game, understand no authent Gucci handbag can sell for $30.Whi Tesla Motor Inc (TSLA) Will Gain 20% in 2017The real Gucci ha good reason not to like it, but a buyer of a $30 knockoff isn't apt to be a potenti buyer for the real thing. And, even to the extent fake merchandis should be combated, the sheer number of those vendor make it an almost insurmount task.In other words, Alibaba stock holder worri the two recent file lawsuit mark the begin of a much more disrupt period for the e-commerc giant need not worry.A of thi writing, Jame Brumley did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlace7 Cheap Stock to Buy That Could Doubl in 20177 ""New Industrial"" Stock to Bore You to the BankTh postWhi Alibaba Group Hold Ltd (BABA) Stock Is a Survivorappear first onInvestorPlace."

From noncompli issu in New York Citi to regulatori concern and lack of driver background checks, Uber ha drawn scrutini and criticism, and ha even been ban in The Netherland and in part of Thailand, India, and China.It' no secret that tradit taxi servic are not happi with the rise of Uber and other ride-hail companies, and mani argu that Uber should be subject to the same regul that they face. In dozen of citi it ha move in to, Uber ha face intens opposition, lobbying, and legal challeng against it from these taxi companies.Ub ha also been embroil in along-stand battlewith it drivers. A group of driver first su the compani back in 2013, claim they should be classifi as employe rather than independ contractors. As a result, Uber had been set to pay up to $100 million in reimburs damag to almost 400,000 drivers, but recently, a feder judg in California rule that the settlement wa unfair.But as the say goes, ani public is good publicity, and all of the bad press ha yet to realli neg affect Uber. Despitelos over $1 billionin the first half of 2016, Uber gain just as much revenu in that same time period. It abil to rais exorbit amount of money is incred impress for a compani who is less than a decad old, and thi skill make Uber that much more attract to ventur capit investors.IPO PotentialDespit these controversies, investor are eagerli await an Uber IPO. Mani have believed, or hoped, the compani would go public for a few year now, but Uber CEO Travi Kalanick want ""to make sure [an IPO] happen as late as possible,"" said in an interview withCNBClast year.If and when Uber final decid to go public, it potenti would depend on the broader IPO market and econom environment. Accord to Renaiss Capital, IPO onli rais a paltri $18.9 billion in 2016, with annual proce fall to the lowest level sinc 2003. Just four compani file public offer that gross over $1 billion.Look ahead, it' difficult to pinpoint how busi the IPO market will be thi year. Snap Inc., the parent compani of Snapchat, music stream platform Spotify, and other major tech giant have signal plan to go public in 2017. And recent high-growth IPO like Twilio Inc.TWLOand NutanixNTNXhav trade strongli sinc their debut, a good sign for tech compani everywher look to make their trade debut.How Might Uber Perform?An IPO for Uber could be massiv for both the compani and Wall Street.

"10 Stocks That Will Hurt Your Retirement, Not Help It",1/9/2017,"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsTh first rule of medicin is to do no harm. Your retirement, like your health, is someth that you can't afford to screw up. And as with your health, have a safe and stabl retir is gener less about do thing right and more about avoid major mistakes.Source: ShutterstockJust as you don't have to be a marathon runner to live a long, healthi life, you don't have to have Warren Buffett' stock pick acumen to retir well. Just avoid excess booz or tobacco - or take larg loss in the stock market - and you'r well on your way.makeArticleAd();Today, we'r go to look at 10 stock that you should probabl avoid in a retir portfolio. None are necessarili bad stock totrade. In fact, I'd argu that there is no such thing as a bad stock to trade if you'r do it with capit you'r comfort put at risk. But there is a differ between a stock you trade for short-term profit and a stock that you'r plan to use to fund your retirement.A retir stock should be one that ha surviv the test of time and that is ""futur proof,"" or at least as futur proof as a compani can be these days. Thi rule out most technolog stocks, which often have short live as disruptor befor be disrupt themselves, and stock that depend on fickl consum tastes.7 Cheap Stock to Buy That Could Doubl in 2017So with no more ado, here are 10 stock that are more like to hurt your retir than help it.Stock That Will Hurt Your Retirement: Tesla (TSLA)Source:Windel Oskay via Flickr (Modified)Tesla Motor Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) is a stock that I want to like. I realli do. I love Elon Musk' vision for the company, and I can credibl say that Musk and Tesla have done more to promot altern energi and driverless car than just about anyon els out there.When we enjoy an emission-fre futur in which our car drive us to work while we brows our messag and sip on lattes, we'll have Musk to thank for that reality.Th problem is, I'm not sure Tesla is go to be the compani to benefit from it. Tesla may or may not even be in busi a decad from now. You see, while Tesla might have start the revolution, it larger, more entrench competitor have been quick to muscl in. Virtual everi larg automak is experi with driverless technology, and most are work on green alternatives.Meanwhile, Tesla stock trade for nearli seven time sale … and actual lose money.So, while I wish Mr. Musk the best of luck - and look forward to enjoy the fruit of hi labor - I don't want to put my retir at risk by buy the stock.Stock That Will Hurt Your Retirement: Twitter (TWTR)Source:Christoph via FlickrAnoth tech stock that ha chang the world, yet can't seem to find a way to profit from it isTwitt Inc(NYSE:TWTR).Twitt ha effect remad the news industri as we know it. It' becom the medium of choic for politicians, celebr and other media person to make major announc … or to just rant.Yet, unlik rivalFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB), it still hasn't quit figur out it profit model yet. Facebook find new and creativ way to squeez more profit out of it user base while also expand that user base. Yet Twitter seem to have mostli stall out. It' also been overrun by spammer and ""bot"" accounts, which reduc it attract to would-b advertisers.7 ""New Industrial"" Stock to Bore You to the BankTwitt trade for about five time sales, which is more or less in line with mani other larg tech companies. Yet Twitter is still struggl to figur out it busi model, which is ridicul thi late in the game. If you want a social media stock to buy and hold, go with Facebook … and dump Twitter.Stock That Will Hurt Your Retirement: Macy' (M)Source:Mik Mozart via FlickrMacy' Inc(NYSE:M), after the beat it ha taken of late, might actual be a decent short-term trade. But I wouldn't want to bet my retir portfolio on it.Macy's, along with sever other depart stores, had a lousi holiday shop season - and thi despit American shopper eagerli open their wallet in 2016.The issu is that American are do more and more of their shop onlin these days, benefit the like ofAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) and it onlin peers. Brick-and-mortar retail in gener have suffered, and big depart store like Macy' have suffer the worst.I don't expect depart store to collect go out of business. After a period of consolidation, they will find their new place in a retail market in which the primari role of a brick-and-mortar store is to act as a showroom of sorts. But after the dust settles, I'd recommend steer clear of depart stores, at least with your retir portfolio.Stock That Will Hurt Your Retirement: IBM (IBM)Source:Open Grid Schedul Via FlickrIntern Busi Machin Corp.(NYSE:IBM) just can't seem to do anyth right these days. It revenu have been in declin for an almost unbeliev 18 consecut quarters.That' four and a halfyearsof sale declines. You would think that by now the compar sale would be so low that IBM would have an easi time post at least modest growth … yet the loss continue.IBM is a perfect exampl of a compani that is far from futur proof. It' tradit busi model wa blown out of the water by cloud upstart like Amazon andMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT), and IBM ha adapt at a sluggish pace. Frankly, the IBM pedigre just isn't worth what it use to be.10 of the Worst Valu on Wall StreetIBM wa one of Warren Buffett' biggest portfolio addit of the past decade, and Buffett bought it precis becaus he like the recur natur of IBM' incom stream from long-term servic contracts. Well, the cloud kill that busi model, so it' time to move on. Dump IBM from your retir portfolio.Stock That Will Hurt Your Retirement: Chipotl (CMG)Source: ShutterstockI loveChipotl Mexican Grill, Inc.(NYSE:CMG) burritos. I realli do. I could quit liter eat one everi day of my life and never get sick of them (no E. coli pun intended). But as much as I love the company' food, the stock is one I'd consid riski as a long-term hold for a retir portfolio.Food, like clothing, is subject to the whim of fashion. And Chipotl wa one of the first chain to capit on the trend toward healthier eat with more organ ingredients. The problem is that there is no real durabl competit advantag there. Ani Johnny-come-l restaur chain can jump on the organ bandwagon.Despit the beat that Chipotl stock ha taken in recent years, due mostli to it health scandal and poor response, CMG stock is far from cheap at current prices. It trade for 44 time expect earnings. The stock price ha been rel stabl for the past six months, and it could be the larg loss have run their course. But thi is still not a stock I'd want to bank my retir on.Stock That Will Hurt Your Retirement: Buffalo Wild Wing (BWLD)Source: ShutterstockAlong the same line, I'd recommend dump share ofBuffalo Wild Wings(NASDAQ:BWLD).A a seller of primarili wing and beer, Buffalo Wild Wing ha definit not ridden the healthi and organ eat wave that push Chipotl to success. No, thi company' success is tie more to timeless appeal of beer and football, and the compani ha been in oper sinc 1982.30-plu year of servic might suggest that Buffalo Wild Wing ha surviv the test of time and that it might actual be a decent long-term retir stock. I disagree.Buffalo Wild Wing' nationwid expans is a more recent endeavor, and it success ha brought a host of competitors, includingWingstop Inc(NASDAQ:WING). The fact is, wing and beer got to be trendi a few year back, and the space is complet satur at thi point, not unlik the Tex-Mex space wa 15 year ago. Diner got burn out with Tex-Mex, and I think wing shop are at risk of similar diner burnout.5 Stock to Buy for a Big JanuaryBuffalo Wild Wing isn't wildli expensive, trade at 23 time expect earnings. But I'd steer clear of it as a retir stock.Stock That Will Hurt Your Retirement: Whole Food (WFM)Source:Mik Mozart via Flickr (Modified)Whol Food Market, Inc.(NASDAQ:WFM) ha the same problem that Chipotl does, and I'm not talk about food safeti issues.Lik Chipotle, Whole Food wa earli to the healthi and organ movement. You could even argu that they were afounderof the movement and one of it biggest earli beneficiaries.Th problem, as with Chipotle, is that there is no real durabl advantag there and noth to stop it rival from sell the same product … and do so more cheaply.I like Whole Food and I can credibl say that the averag American eat healthier today in no small part due to the store' influence. But that doesn't mean I want to bet my retir on it.WFM trade for 21 time expect earnings, which is a bit rich for a groceri store stock. Yes, Whole Food is a premium store. I get that. But virtual everi grocer in town is gentrifi it product lines, and you also have a bud new competit threat from Amazon with home deliveri … in some case done by aerial drones.Buy Whole Food' produc if you like, but I'd steer clear of the stock.Stock That Will Hurt Your Retirement: Altria (MO)Source:Peyri Herrera via Flickr (Modified)Even 10 year ago, I probabl would have consid Marlboro-makerAltria Group Inc(NYSE:MO)to be a rock-solid retir stock.Aft all, peopl have been smoke tobacco product sinc the America were discov over 500 year ago. One might think that a half millennium is long enough to surviv the test of time.But unfortun for Altria, the time realli have changed. Due to rise health costs, virtual everi govern in the world ha made it their object to reduc smoking, particularli among teenagers. And it' actual working; American teenag are more like to have use an illeg drug over the past year than smoke a cigarette.It' not necessarili a deal breaker to buy a stock in slow decline, so long as the stock is price right. I'v made good money trade tobacco stock over the past 20 year when their price have gotten suffici beaten down.Th 10 Best Contrarian Stock to Buy in the New YearTh problem is, tobacco stock are far from cheap today. Altria trade for over 20 time expect earn and yield just 3.5%. That' simpli too high a price to pay for a compani in termin decline.Stock That Will Hurt Your Retirement:Coca-Cola (KO)Source:Leo Hidalgo via Flickr (Modified)Along the same lines, I'd have to add the iconicTh Coca-Cola Co(NYSE:KO) to the list. Now that govern have success beaten down tobacco use, they'v move their attent to the so-cal obes epidem and it chief culprit: sugari sodas.And ad to thi is the gener trend toward healthier eating. Among the more fashion sort, drink a Coke is just so … déclassé.Hey, I like a cold Dr. Pepper as much as the next Texan, but we seem to be in the minority. Soda sale have been in declin for 11 consecut year and counting.Now, Coca-Cola sell a lot more than just Coke and Diet Coke. The compani ha profit busi in bottl water, sport drink and fruit juices. But it' hard to get enthusiast about the company' prospect when it namesak product is in decline, with no sign of respite.At current prices, KO trade for 21 time earn and yield 3.3%. That' not ridicul expens by ani stretch, but it' not cheap enough given the company' growth problem. So for now, I'm recommend you dump Coca-Cola from your retir portfolio.Stock That Will Hurt Your Retirement:iShar 20+ Year Treasuri Bond (TLT)And finally, I'm go to recommend that you steer clear of bond index exchange-trad fund like theiShar 20+ Yr Treas.Bond (ETF)(NASDAQ:TLT).Bond have tradit been an import part of most retir portfolios, and even at today' low yield I think you could make a solid argument for includ bonds. But includ bond and includ bond ETF are two veri differ things.It come down to interest rate risk. A bond ha no real interest rate risk if held to maturity. Rise yield will caus the market price to fall, but it doesn't realli matter if you'r not plan to sell. The bond will matur at it par valu no matter what happen to price between now and then. But bond ETF don't have a fix maturity. There are presum to be perpetual. So if we were to enter a long period of rise yield (such as dure the 1970s), your bond ETF would get killed.Th 10 Best Stock to Buy for 2017: The Experts' PicksConsid that one of the primari role of bond is toreducerisk of loss, that seem like a lousi bet. So if you own TLT, consid dump it and replac it with a proper ladder of individu bonds.Charl Sizemor is the princip ofSizemor Capit Management, an invest firm base in Dallas.

Some AAPL sharehold are understand concern we may not even bother to rememb the phone' 20th birthday.Phon 7 Mark End of Apple' Smartphon ReignThere' no deni the iPhon ha earn it stripes. As they say, though, noth last forever. A combin of time, satur and competit ha final caught up with the iPhone.7 Cheap Stock to Buy That Could Doubl in 2017The evid of thi slowdown start to materi with the respons to the iPhon 6s late last year. It wa the first iter of the iPhon that not onlydidn't sell as well as it predecessors, but also the first to see a dropoff in sale in the two quarter follow it launch.Som of the company' staunchest support explain that most consum were hold out for the iPhon 7, which would be a superior device.Mayb there wa some truth to the idea. The same parti line is be recycl now, however, with would-b iPhon buyer now reportedli hold out for an iPhon 8. It lead one to wonder if the consum respons to the iPhon 8 will be as lacklust as the respons to the iPhon 7 ha been, with the bulk of them hold out for what will be the iPhon 8s or the iPhon 9.And that' when it hit AAPL investor right in the gut… at some point, the compani ha to sell iPhon right here, right now, and grow those sale as Appl manag to all the way through the iPhon 6.Perhap the crux of the problem isn't would-b buyer wait for the next version. Perhap most everyon who is go to own ani smartphon ha a phone they can live with for a while. Perhap competitor have final figur out how to make a smartphon that' just as impress as the iPhon use to be compar to alternatives. As mobil industri consultantChetan Sharma observed:""Appl ha the strongest ecosystem, with it hardware, softwar and app and content stores. iPhon user look for an upgrad stick with Apple. But in a year when Samsung drop the ball in a huge way, Appl didn't have a phone with a compel enough featur set to lure Samsung owner away.""And make no mistak - the iPhon 7 hasn't been fli off the shelv the way it wa expect to. Two week ago, the Nikkei Asian Review report the companycut it plan Q1-2017 product of the iPhon 7 by 10%compar to iPhon product from a year earlier [product of the iPhon 6s].Let' also not forget that in September, for the first time in years, Appl unexpectedli opt to not share figur from the first weekend' sale of the iPhon 7. The compani said they no longer mattered. Other believ the compani simpli didn't want to report weaker results.Th iPhon 8 Can't Stop the InevitableBut can the iPhon 8 turn thing around for the company, and relight a fire underneath AAPL stock?Maybe. The usual support are certainli hard at work again, point out theall-glass body, edge-to-edg screen, and the OLE display. They all seem and sound like improv to it predecessor. With the except to the rumor wireless charg though, the rumor spec may well be solut to problem that don't actual exist.That ha not prevent mani peopl - includ analyst - from predict big thing from the iPhon 8.Nomura Securities, as an example, believ the iPhon 8 will break all previou iPhon sale records. Just remember, though, it wa Nomura that also said demand for the iPhon 7 waseven stronger than it had expected, and that the suppli chain wa on the verg of ramp up product of the device. Nomurarais it price target on AAPL stockfrom $120 to $135 in response.In the meantime, not onli have Appl share not ralli to $135 (or even $120) on the heel of what wa suppos to be a big catalyst, we'v seen multipl report suggest demand for the devic wasquickli quelled.Whi Tesla Motor Inc (TSLA) Will Gain 20% in 2017Point being, take ani optim surround the iPhon 8 with a grain of salt. We'v heard it befor with the iPhon 7, and it wa wrong.Bottom Line for AAPL StockStill, there' no deni the iPhon ha earn a spot in the smartphon hall of fame. Though it wasn't the first to develop such a product - that honor belong toBlackBerri Ltd(NASDAQ:BBRY) - Appl wa the first to make the smartphon a mainstream consum device, and for year wa the name all other aspir to be like.Noth last forev though. While Appl and the iPhon will both be around for the long haul, the domin of the iPhon that made AAPL such a great trade is fading.

Why Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Will Gain 20% in 2017,1/9/2017,"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsMak an invest case forTesla Motor Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) is not that difficult. One onli need to look toward the future. Autonom vehicles, connect cars, and cleaner/renew energi are expect to be strong growth driver in the year ahead. And those are two of Tesla' main busi segments. TSLA stock, then, should be in good hands.Source: ShutterstockAt last week' 2017Consum Electron Showin La Vegas, for instance, car and auto technolog play an even bigger role compar to three to five year ago. The show includ keynot or present from almost everi major automak and A-list auto suppliers.makeArticleAd();In other words, Tesla - which arguabl first intersect the auto and tech sector - is in the right growth lane. While TSLA stock ha yet to full respond to the growth driver ahead, it' onli a matter a time.Tesla Need to Graduat From PotentialStill, Tesla' toughest challeng is to prove to critic that it can graduat the busi from one of ""strong potential"" to a money-mak venture. To date, that ha been prevail attack on CEO Elon Musk and what ha kept Tesla stock from drive meaning higher over the past coupl years.Whil Musk ha deliv onth company' new Gigafactory, which began product last week, Tesla againmiss on it most recent quarterli vehicl product target- keep up a track record TSLA ha been tri to shed. That news sent TSLA share down some 2%.Tesla deliv roughli 22,200 vehicl dure the last three month of 2016, fall short of the origin project of 25,000 units. For the full year, the electr car compani deliv 76,230 unit - also shi of the 80,000 vehicl Musk had promis to deliver.Th 10 Best Stock to Buy for 2017: The Experts' PicksFrom my glass-half-ful perspective, the fact that Tesla came less than 4,000 unit shi of it full-year total wasencouraging. Critics, however, took the miss as more reason to avoid TSLA stock.Said Barclay analyst Brian Johnson last week:""Ther is a high risk of execut missteps, a challeng track record on meet timelines, cost challeng and potenti impact from an otherwis full plate of initi in '17.""The Gigafactori Chang ThingsDespit the noise, there' also reason for increas optim about Tesla stock. Notably,th new Gigafactory- which wa deliv on time - could be the game-chang Tesla ha needed.Onc completed, the Gigafactori will be the world' largest factori of ani kind, and eventu manufactur lithium-ion batteri for 500,000 vehicl annually, as well as for other purposes. Batteri are the limit factor for electr cars, so Tesla' fix is to single-handedli doubl the world' lithium-ion batteri production.Whil the Gigafactori - which is less than a third complete, and is expect to be finish by 2018 - ha been expens to build, estim at $5 billion, it will acceler the pace at which Tesla can becom profit sinc the Gigafactori can boost margin on unit sale of the Model S and Model X (and eventu the Model 3).At the same time, it' possibl that compet auto manufactur such asFord Motor Company(NYSE:F) andGener Motor Company(NYSE:GM) will reli on Tesla for their batteries.Th 10 Best Mutual Fund to Buy for 2017Bottom Line for TSLA StockTesla stock should be owned, not traded. While the compani is spend ton of cash to deliv on it aggress Model 3 product product total for later thi year, it' tough to bet against Musk.Assum the compani doe reach it deliveri target and begin Model 3 product thi year, TSLA stock - current at around $229 - is pois to regain it 2016 high of around $270.That would come out to roughli 20% return in 2017.A of thi writing, Richard Saintvilu did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlaceAdvanc Micro Devices, Inc.

AMZN stock ha been sandwich between it 50- and 200-day move averag for some time, suggest pensiv among the bulls.A Challeng Environ for AMZN StockI think anybodi can appreci the lack of confid toward AMZN stock. Wall Street is about make profits, not pontif about prior achievements. If there' one thing that can disrupt Amazon stock, it would be declin consum sentiment. To that end,reduc advertisementsbi retail is a worrisom sign.Click to EnlargeThi is where hard data can help distinguish between either a natur correct for AMZN stock, or someth more permanent. Accord to the U.S. Censu Bureau, e-commerc is anunstopp force.In the six year from 2000 through the end of 2005, onlin retail sale total $326.6 million. In last year alone, that figur jump to $341.5 million. By default, thi just feed into the Amazon stock machine.But more so than the raw numbers, the growth rate in onlin retail continu to impress. Of course, noth will come close to the nascent year of e-commerce. In the 2000s, onlin sale grew annual by 21%. But over the past six years, the growth rate is still a robust 15%. Sinc all indic point to a superior perform in the fourth quarter of 2016, that rate is onli go higher.Thi is simpli great news for AMZN stock.

In addition, aggreg retail sale thi decad averag an anem 4.5%.Amazon Demonstr Whi It' the BestI think we also need to acknowledg anoth basic realiti - AMZN is a freak of nature.

Case in point is the more thanon billion productsthat were push out the door due to it Prime and Fulfil services. That ha to be a major letdown for Amazon stock competitors, who are tri to find some way of remot keep pace.An even greater challeng is address the in-hous sale that the Seattle-bas compani generates. Demand for the Echo speaker that are an accessori to Amazon' Alexa voic recognit softwar jump nine fold from last year' holiday season. Accord to their senior manag team, the Echo wa fli off the shelf despit a signific boost in production. If there' just one reason to buy AMZN stock, that might be it.Finally, the most impress element of the organ is that they haven't lost their hunger for innovation.Amazon Go- the firm' foray into the ultra-competit groceri sector - is noth short of astonishing.

If Tesla plan on sell it batteri pack outsid it door - and it doe base on it estim product size and recent deal - then it need to find the perfect price in the middle. Not too hot and not too cold.That need to happen soon, too. The first thing roll off the Gigafactori line are storag batteries, not vehicl packs.Thi Is Everyth to TSLA StockTesla' Gigafactori is a much-need gamble. Without it, Musk can't achiev hi vision of have an integr clean energi company.

The Simple Reason I Won't Buy Tesla Motors Stock,1/4/2017,"Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Imag source:OnInnovationvia Flickr. Copyright 2010 The Henri Ford. Republish underCC BY-ND 2.0.There is a simpl reason I won't buy share ofTesla Motor Inc.(NASDAQ: TSLA) : I don't trust founder-CEO Elon Musk.Let me explain. It' not that I think Musk is fundament dishonest, but rather that hi grand unifi vision for hi compani ha blind him to hi respons to minor sharehold and to the risk he is ask them to bear. The Tesla Motorsacquisition-rescueof SolarC Corp. is all the evid I need to support that proposition.makeArticleAd();In a deal with as much potenti for conflict of interest as thi one, I think Musk had a person oblig to spell out the enorm risk associ with the acquisit in a clear and forthright manner, instead of let the lawyer address them in legales in the page of a secur filing. He didn't.A tangl webIf you'r read thi article, I assum you'r probabl familiar with the conflict of interest I refer to above, but let me recap the most obviou one for those reader who aren't:Musk is the co-founder, chief executive, chairman and largest sharehold of electr car manufactur Tesla Motors, with a 20.8% stake.Musk wa also the chairman and largest sharehold of solar power system manufactur SolarCity.Lyndon Rive, SolarCity' then-CEO and board member, is Musk' cousin. Rive' co-founder, hi brother Peter Rive, wa SolarCity' chief technolog offic and a board member.Allow me to draw on one of the lesson that 50 year of stewardship ofBerkshir Hathawaytaught CEO Warren Buffett. As he wrote in hi golden anniversari annual letter (emphasi mine):Sever of my subsequ error also involv the use of Berkshir share to purchas busi whose earn were destin to simpli limp along.Mistak of that kind are deadly... Too often CEO seem blind to an elementari reality: The intrins valu of the share you give in an acquisit must not be greater than the intrins valu of the busi you receive.A lose exchangeTesla gave away 0.11 of it share for everi SolarC share. Here is what I think they receiv in return, in term of intrins value: zero. That' what I think SolarC is worth as a go concern. It isn't profitable, either under GAAP (gener accept account principles) or on a cash basis. The most recent estim have SolarC record an account loss of close to a billion dollar in 2017, follow an estim $925 million loss in 2016.Bi the end of the third quarter of 2016, SolarCity' cash had declin to $259 million from $373 million 12 month prior -- despit have issu debt and equiti total $849 million (net basis) over that period. Yet Teslatout as a financi benefitof the acquisit that it ""i expect to be addit to Tesla' cash balance... We expect SolarC to add more than half a billion dollar in cash to Tesla' balanc sheet over the next 3 years."" Here' to wishing!Apparently, I'm not the onli with genuin skeptic regard the equiti valu Tesla sharehold receiv in acquir SolarCity. In themerg proposalit file with the Secur and Exchang Commiss on Aug. 31, Tesla reveal thatfifteeninstitut investor had pass on acquir SolarC or even simpli make an equiti invest in it, and that the compani wa face a liquid squeeze. On it most recent financials, the company' Altman Z-score of -0.20 indic a signific risk of bankruptcy.""[A] match made in market heaven""With the acquisit by Tesla, SolarC ha found a lifelin such that financi distress is no longer imminent. However, to justifi the acquisit on ani basi other than as a rescu operation, you have to buy into Musk' vision of the rich synergi between the two businesses. I don't. As New York Universityfin professor and valuat expert Aswath Damodaranwrotein September:I don't think that Tesla' Solar Citi acquisit pass [either] the smell test (for conflict of interest) [or] the common sens test (of creat value), but I am not a sharehold in either Tesla or Solar Citi and I don't get a vote. When Tesla sharehold vote, given that own the stock is by itself an admiss that they buy into the Musk vision, I would not be surpris if they go along with hi recommendations. Tesla sharehold and Elon Musk are a match made in market heaven and I wish them the best of luck in their life together.(Note: Tesla sharehold approv the acquisit on Nov. 17, and the deal close five day later.)Lik Damodaran, I'm not a Tesla shareholder. I respect Musk for hi entrepreneuri vision and for what he ha achieved, but there is a fine line between visionari drive in emerg industri and recklessness. As far as I'm concerned, buy or hold Tesla Motor share at thi point ha more to do with blind faith than investing.10 stock we like better than Tesla MotorsWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Why Tesla Motors' Guidance Misses Should Concern Investors,1/4/2017,"Tesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) said that it deliv about 22,200 vehicl in the fourth quarter of 2016, a number that left it short of it own guidanc for both the quarter and the full year.It' far from the first time that Tesla ha miss it own guidance, of course. Investor appear to take thi latest shortfal in stride. But the trend suggest that Tesla might miss some key deadlines, and that could have much more seriou consequ for the stock.""Short-term product challenges""Tesla' guidanc had call for ""just over 25,000"" deliveri in the fourth quarter and at least 80,000 for the full year. But it fourth-quart shortfal left it talli for the full year at 76,230 vehicl deliv to customers.makeArticleAd();Now in it fifth year of production, Tesla' Model S may be face declin demand. Imag source: Tesla Motors.In a statement late on Tuesday, Tesla said that ""short-term product challeng start at the end of Octob and last through earli December"" left it scrambl to make up lost product late in the quarter.Tesla blame the ""challenges"" on it transact to instal new hardwar for it Autopilot driver-assist system. The compani said on Octob 19 that it would begin ship all of it new vehicl with thehardwar necessari for fulli autonom driving, allow it to gradual enabl self-driv capabl in those car with softwar updat over time.Tesla last reaffirm it fourth-quart guidanc in a sharehold letter on Octob 26. Apparently, the ""product challenges"" start in the day immedi follow the letter.Anoth in a long list of miss goalsTesla ha a long histori of miss it own targets, whether for sale totals, profits, or the time of key product-rel events. CEO Elon Musk ha acknowledg that the compani sometim fall short, say that he set ambiti goal for the compani as a way to motiv employe and suppliers.That may work, but it make it challeng for investor to evalu the company' state busi plans. Musk ha said that Tesla will begin product of it compact Model 3 sedan sometim in 2017, but mani analyst feel that' unlikely.In a note on Tuesday befor Tesla announc it deliveri totals,Barclaysauto analyst Brian Johnson said that there' a high probabl that the compani won't be abl to deliv ani Model 3s in 2017.Whi Tesla' routin miss could eventu be troubl for the stockView in the context of it past results, Tesla' 2016 deliveri total is impress even if it fell short of Musk' goal. But it' still far short of the hundr of thousand -- or million -- of annual deliveri that Tesla will need to be a viabl automak over the long term.Tesla ha said that it ha nearli 400,000 preorder for the Model 3. But more and more big automak are announc plan to bring long-rang electr vehicl to market over the next few years. (Just yesterday,Ford Motor Company(NYSE: F) said that it will begin product of anelectr SUV with 300 mile of rangebi 2020.)If the Model 3 is delayed, which seem like given Tesla' history, that could mean that those order won't be fill until late 2018 or 2019. How mani of those custom will give up and choos an electr vehicl from a major automak instead?Tesla had a signific technolog advantag over the big automak when it first launch the Model S in 2012. But the risk to Tesla as an invest ha alway been that the big automak might close the electric-vehicl technolog gapbefor Tesla can get to sustain scale, leav the upstart Silicon Valley automak in an uphil battl for market share against better-fund competition.That risk could becom realiti if the Model 3 is delay significantly. Tesla ha built a great brand and the Model 3 will find buyer no matter what happens. But the longer it waits, the harder it will be for Tesla to ramp up to the million of deliveri a year that it will need to support it current sky-high valuation.10 stock we like better than Tesla MotorsWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The turn in the stock' price are often sharp - it plung from $240 to $150 about a year ago, then hit $250 again within two month - but they gener stay within the range.makeArticleAd();At the open price of about $213.44, then, Tesla is clearli in ""meh"" territory. An uptrend ha been in place for a month now, but if you jump in you'r like to see a revers after a gain of about 10%.What' Up With TSLA Stock Now?Th main problem for Teslaremain what it ha alway been, scale product to meet the stock price' expectations.Th 10 Best Contrarian Stock to Buy in the New YearFor the third quarter in four for 2016,Tesla miss it product estimates, deliv just 22,200 cars. The origin estim for the year had been 80,000 to 90,000 cars. The final number wa 76,230. That compar with50,580 for 2015, so 2016 product show a more than 50% increase.Tesla continu to paint a rosi product picture, and CEO Elon Musk think it will deliv 800,000 car next year. Thi will includ the Model 3, a $35,000 unit on which 400,000 pre-ord (with $1,000 checks) were taken on it announcement.Th car are certain to be cool. The question is whether there will be enough of them to show a profit and pleas Wall Street.What If Musk Is Right?Th product shortfal sent the share down about $4, but they should go right back up today as the compani offer investor a tour of it Sparks, Nevada battery""gigafactory,""host by Musk himself. The Nevada factori suppli batteri for Tesla car and stand-alon PowerWal that can store electr produc by SolarC solar panels.It is thi product ramp-up that ha both bull and bear worried. If Tesla continu to fall short thi year, the bear think the stock will collapseonc and for all. If it come close to it goal then, ad in the Supercharg center (on which it' final go tostart make money thi year), the PowerWal and the solar panels, the thought is the bull may run again.SolarCity, which Teslaform acquir in November, wa last year' reason to worry. The concern wa that the solar panel maker would drag the whole compani down with it. Sinc oil price are now rising, SolarC should soon see posit margins, especi as it' sold alongsid other Tesla products, so that worri is passing.But whenev a worri pass with Tesla, a new worri replac it. Mayb if Musk' product plan seem about to fail, he'll buy SpaceX. Or, if they seem about to succeed, he'll geta white Persian cat.Tesla Is a Trade and a TeaseFor analyst and reporters, Tesla is the gift that keep on giving. In a black suit and blue tie world, Elon Musk and Tesla are a tie-di shirt. The stori is alway fun and alway subject to chang without notice.But beneath the hype, and the talk of immin catastroph or unlimit profit, lie thi truth. Musk is build a real company, but he may never let the stock get out of it trade range, becaus onc Tesla accomplish a goal he will find it loftier goal that will worri analyst about hi sanity, and that of hi investors.Fitbit Inc (FIT) Stock Is a Zombie, But the Cure Is ComingThus, if you'r go to get involv in Tesla shares, and I'm not recommend you do unless you like some manic-depress with your morn coffee, just watch the trade range.

It' an intrigu idea. But it' also a huge miss opportun -- and a troubl sign for FCA investors.A potenti Tesla competitor, if it were realFCA said that the Portal ""explor the possibl of what a famili transport vehicl could look like."" It ha some self-driv capabilities, FCA said, and the abil to connect to person devic and ""the cloud"" in way that will help to keep the kid entertain on long (or not so long) trips.FCA said that the Portal ha a battery-electr drivetrain with 250 mile of range. It batteri pack are built into the floor, in the style ofTesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) . Fast-charg capabl will be abl to add 150 mile of rang in about 20 minutes.Simpli put, the Portal repres an intrigu and advanc potenti competitor to Tesla' Model X, one that could turn the market for ""kid-hauler"" vehicl on it head.Or it would, if FCA plan to build it. But the Portal is strictli a show car -- and that' the problem.Thi isn't the electr minivan FCA desper needsHere' whi it' a problem: The auto industri is chang rapidly, but there are few sign that FCA is take step to keep up. Thi show vehicl doesn't realli chang that, but an electr vehicl intend for product might have.Right now, FCA ha pickup truck and Jeep SUV and Hemi V8s, along with a nice new minivan. (And, to be fair, a brand-new hybrid version of that minivan.) They'r popular product and sale have been good. But with no hybrid or electr vehicl to offset them and improv it corpor fuel-economi average, FCA is head for trouble.Th Portal' dash is a show-car flight of fancy. Imag source: Fiat Chrysler Automobil NV.FCA doe have a deal withAlphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) Waymo self-driv car subsidiari that ha produc someself-driv test vehiclesand a version of FCA' touchscreen system that integr the Android oper system. But it' lack a rang of hybrid and a seriou electric-car effort as fuel-economi rule tighten -- and that' go to be a big problem in a few years.Th contrast with FCA' old Detroit rival is instructive.Gener Motors(NYSE: GM) ha a long-rang electr carin productionand a massiv effort under way to develop self-driv technolog in-house.Ford(NYSE: F) also ha a big self-driv develop effort under way, along with a rang of well-regard hybrid and clear, credibl plan to add mani more electrifi vehicl over the next few years. And both have made it clear that they are grappl serious with the larger technology-driven chang come to the busi of autos.Chrysl wouldn't have miss thi huge opportunity, but FCA didNot all of the incumb global automak will be abl to make the leap into the not-too-dist electrified, self-driving, ride-hail future. Some will be displac (or ""disrupted"") by new entrant like Tesla and Waymo. It' a good bet that GM and Ford will be import player in that future, becaus they'r take the step to get there now. FCA, which is struggl under a huge debt load, hasn't kept up.A fulli electr version of the Chrysler Pacifica would have been a more impress statement by FCA. Imag source: Fiat Chrysler Automobil NV.At sever point in it long and checker history, the old Chrysler Corpor wa abl to dodg corpor death with a brilliant new product at just the right moment. FCA had the opportun to do that today -- and frankly, when he heard that an electr minivan wa in the works, your humbl Fool expect aclass Chrysler masterstroke.Imagin if instead of a futurist concept, FCA had shown a long-rang electr version of itscurrentminivan, the gorgeou Chrysler Pacifica -- and had announc plan to put it into production. Sure, it might take a few year and a huge intern effort to bring that vehicl to market, given that FCA is start from behind. But it would have the potenti to be the first electr vehicl that realli connect with the mass market: an electr minivan perfect for tech-savvi young families.An electr Pacifica would have been a much more power statement that FCA see the futur come andplan to join itin bold style. Instead, it built a vehicl that is just for show, with technolog that might or might not actual exist. That also make a statement, and not a good one.10 stock we like better than Fiat Chrysler AutomobilesWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Can Tesla Stock Drive 60 Percent Higher in 2017?,1/3/2017,"The continu pattern of stop-and-go in share of Tesla (TSLA) wa frustrat to watch in 2016.

And much of Tesla' 2016 struggl wa caus by the company' inabl to make good on some promises, includ it own vehicl product and deliveri estimates. And to say noth about the headach CEO Elon Musk caus by spend $2.6 billion to acquir SolarC -- a deal Wall Street collect hated.Can thing chang in 2017? Ben Kallo, analyst at Baird, who ad Tesla as a 2017 best-pick candidate, think so. While cite the company' upcom Model 3 and what he think is an undervalu energi storag business, Kallo last Friday slap Tesla stock with Outperform rate and a $338 price target. Tesla share close Friday at $213.69, suggest a potenti premium of almost 60%.makeArticleAd();""W think the ramp of Tesla Energi and Model 3 product could exceed expect dure 2017, and believ the opportun is not current reflect in share price,"" Kallo wrote last Friday. ""We believ Tesla batteri sale are accelerating, and we should see addit benefit from the batteri product ramp coincid with the launch of the Model 3.""Call Kallo' price target ""overli optimistic"" would be a gross understatement. Tesla share have a consensu target of $236, which is 30% below Kallo' estim and suggest onli a 10% increas from current levels. Tesla, nonetheless, end 2016 on a strong note. Despit the 11% declin last year, the share drove about 5% higher in the last three month of the year, post 14.37% gain just in the last thirti days.Indeed, Elon Musk still ha a lot to prove. He' promis that Model 3 deliveri will begin in 2017. For that to happen, Tesla need cash to fund it aggress product and deliveri targets. Musk must also fulli integr SolarCity, which -- in it own right -- ha struggl with profitability. To the extent Tesla' own cash-burn rate can fund both oper and meet it deliveri forecast remain to be seen.But as with Kallo, it' tough to bet against Musk and against Tesla stock. Assum the compani doe reach it deliveri target and begin Model 3 product thi year, Tesla stock should regain it 2016 high of around $270, post some 25% return in 2017. While it' not 60%, it' not bad either.loadGallery({ galleryId : ""elon-musk"", adFrequ : 5, stageHeight: ""350px"", adSit : ""news"", adZon : ""slideshows"", adTitl : """", adSize: ""300x250"" });"

The lengthi technic congest should be near it conclusion, and a capitul (for either the bull or the bears) look to be in the cards.For the bulls, most recently, Baird & Co. is of the mind that 2017 will pay big dividend for Tesla stock holders.

But sell befor the automak launch it lower-costModel 3, which ultim repres the realiz of the company' ""master plan"" laid out over 10 year ago, could be a mistake. While the stock' valuat ha undoubtedli alreadypr in expect for extraordinari growth, 400,000 deposit-back reserv for the highli anticip vehicl preview a potenti major tip point toward electr vehicl -- and Tesla would be at the center of thi critic shift.Facebook:Facebook stockha run into some road bump recently. The stock ha slid about 11% sinc the compani report it third-quart result on Nov. 2. The quarter' result weregreat, but investor were spook by management' refer to expect for big invest in 2017. Investors, however, haveseen thi before. In 2014, Facebook similarli warn investor of plan for big invest -- and the stock ha sinc soar 56%.Obviously, big spend doesn't automat mean Facebook' stock will rise again. But the world' largest social network ha earn my trust with it long-term plan as it charg forward with big invest in mobile, predict Instagram' huge potenti when it purchas it for $1 billion, and improv it nativ Facebook platform at a blister speed that competit can't match.And it' not like Facebook can't afford to get more aggress with it spending.

Imag source: Getti Images.But beyond these reason for hold these three stock throughout 2017, my main motiv for hold them is simpli to avoid the pitfal of market time and to maxim my time invest in stocks. The best way I know to invest is to simpli buy solid compani with long-term prospect and hold them for the long haul.Sure, if Tesla, Facebook, or Appl begin to consist make poor decisions, I may consid selling.

1 Big Solar Trend to Watch in 2017,1/1/2017,"Effici is now the name of the game in the solar industri and lead manufactur will spend the next few year move beyond commod silicon solar panel to higher-effici technology.SunPow Corporation(NASDAQ: SPWR) ha long led the industri in effici and with it X-Seri product exceed 23% effici that leadership posit won't end soon. But other are start to catch up.Trina Solar(NYSE: TSL) recent announc a new record of 22.61% for it mono-PERC cell technology, someth other will follow.Canadian Solar(NASDAQ: CSIQ) is anoth major manufactur move forward with mono-PERC technology, andTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) is launch high-effici panel thi year with Panasonic' HIT technology. The world of solar energi is about to get a lot more efficient.makeArticleAd();Imag source: Getti Images.Chines solar manufactur put an emphasi on efficiencySolar panel manufacturers, particularli in China, have been plagu by littl differenti in their products. They use similar equip and process to make solar panels, which lead to veri similar panel effici and fairli similar cost structures. But in the last decad there ha been littl incent to focu on effici becaus cost were come down quickli and often offset the advantag higher effici brought.But the cost/effici dynam is changing. Solar panel and overal system cost have come down so far that even a 100-basis-point improv in panel effici can lower a system' cost per watt by 5% or more. And if that effici is combin with lower long-term degradation, as it is with SunPower' panels, the impact on cost per kWh can be even higher. So, manufactur final have an incent to increas effici and lower costs.Trina Solar and Canadian Solar are invest in PERC technolog to move up the valu curve. Higher-effici panel will sell for a higher price per watt, particularli to custom instal small residenti or commerci project where effici is more valuable, and both compani want to captur the financi benefit of the market. For example, a 300-watt solar panel that sell for $0.40 per watt will gener $120 in revenue. A 360-watt panel that sell for $0.55 per watt is worth $198.Now that higher-effici panel are in demand, look for the 15% to 17% effici panel that have domin product to begin to be replac by panel that are 18% to 20% efficient.Tesla' effici playTh effici dynam isn't lost on Tesla' SolarCity, which is build a plant in Buffalo, New York, to make high-effici solar panels. Manag ha said they expect effici to be over 20% when the product launch with 22% panel effici on the horizon.Sinc Tesla is instal mostli small rooftop systems, the invest in effici make sense. It leverag the company' sale and instal cost and put more watt of solar product on each roof.SunPower' two-prong effici planCom from a leadership posit is SunPower, which ha long been an effici leader. The company' E-Seri product, which wa 19% to 21% efficient, is now face competit from PERC manufactur that have a lower cost structure. That' whi the invest in X-Series, which is over 23% efficient, ha been import to the last year' financi result in the residenti market. If X-Seri can continu to improv effici and keep down cost, the compani could maintain a lead over mono-PERC competitors.In the util maker, SunPow is take a differ approach. P-Seri is it low-cost solar panel that' onli slightli more effici than convent solar panels. Right now, it' a multicrystallin product but manag ha told me it will eventu be a mono-crystallin product, like lead to effici approach 20%. And sinc there are fewer process steps, it should be lower cost than mono-PERC on a per-watt basis.Jockey for posit in solar efficiencyEveri major manufactur is tri to improv it effici to differenti itself and 2017 will like be a transit year. A great deal of how the industri progress in the year ahead will depend on if Tesla can make it product as planned, and how SunPower' strategi is play out. Which compani make the right strateg move in improv effici will see a lot of upsid in come years.10 stock we like better than Wal-MartWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

10 Tech Investing Quotes From the World's Best Venture Capitalists,12/31/2016,"Imag source: Getti Images.When you make a live by find and invest in the world' most promis start-ups, you probabl know a thing or two about business. Lead ventur capit firm have mint fortun for themselv and their limit partner by invest in current tech titan likeApple,Alphabet,Oracle,Facebook, and mani more when they were just nascent start-ups.makeArticleAd();However, after consid the busi wisdom ofvisionari busi leaders, it recent occur to me that examin some quot from lead VC could also prove tremend use for tech investors. So, bank off of thi same logic, let' examin a seri of quot from some of the world' lead ventur capitalist on subject includ the busi of ventur capital, busi in general, and technology.About the busi of ventur capitalMani reader may not be particularli familiar with the ventur capit world: how it works, how it' financed, and how VC firm make money. As such, thi quot from Union Squar Ventur partner Fred Wilson serv as a nice way to frame what exactli ventur capitalist do.Ventur capit is about captur the valu between the start-up phase and the public compani phase. -- Fred WilsonIn general, ventur capit firm can invest in privat compani at ani stage in their development. Though not alway as strictli codified, these stage rang from the initi seed round of financ use to get a nascent compani off the ground to the later stages, seri C or later, that often take place in theyear preced an IPO. What' more, the result can be astounding. Accord to the Nation Bureau of Econom Research (NBER), the averag annual return of VC invest is an astound 57%.Especi in moment when tech invest is particularli en vogue, the number of VC firm and the amount of money chase start-up can creat some unintend consequences, as a number of establish ventur capitalist have also noted.Ther are lot of way to make money in ventur capital, and there are even more way to be mediocre. The industri ha too much money and too mani smart peopl chase too few great entrepreneurs. -- Dan LevitanAl market have boom and bust cycles, and I think ventur capit market ha even more exagger boom and bust cycles. -- Fred WilsonBoth issu might sound eerili similar to the issu mani investor encount when invest in the stock market. However, much like our etho here at The Motley Fool, investor can overcome, or even benefit from the cyclic natur of the market by maintain a focu on the long term.Th big advantag that we have as a ventur capit firm over a hedg fund or a mutual fund is we have a 13-year lockup on our money. And so enterpris can go in and out of fashion four differ times, and we can go and invest in one of these companies, and it' OK, becaus we can stay the course. -- Marc AndreessenBusi in generalInvest in high-growth privat compani involv mani of the same skill set public market investor need to cultiv in order to succeed. The best ventur capitalist think about busi models, market economics, and competit dynam at a high level. Especi in the tech sector, where newli mint public compani often remain unprofitable, it' import for investor to rememb that a path toward eventu profit is an essenti piec of ani invest thesis, as Bill Gurley succinctli state in the two follow quote:If one assert that buy custom below what they charg them is a corpor strategy, thi is in essenc an arbitrag game, and arbitrag game rare last. -- Bill GurleyY can creat infinit revenu if you sell dollar for 85 cents. And if you give consum more valu than you charg them for, they will love you. And I remind entrepreneur all the time that Webvan had the highest NP score of ani compani I'v ever known. It wasn't that the consum proposit didn't work, it wa that the econom didn't work. They weren't charg enough for the servic level. -- Bill GurleyA litani of exampl come to mind, here. Compani likeZynga,Gluu Mobile,Skul Candy, and evenTwitterhav gener tremend loss for their investor as the overli optimist stori around which they came public predict fail to materialize. If the company' econom don't make sens or don't seem achievable, that should be a major red flag, but it' one investor have consist overlook -- to their detriment.Also similar to invest in public companies, the leader of the best start-up resembl the entrepreneur run the world' most success public companies. Individu likeTesla' Elon Musk orFacebook' Mark Zuckerberg have taken huge person risk to bring their vision into the world. Further affirm thi idea, lead ventur capitalist also seek thi visionari qualiti in the compani in which they invest.Th veri best entrepreneur are rel advantag in time of scarc capital. They can rais money in ani environment. Loos capit allow the less qualifi to particip in each market. -- Bill GurleyInnov and technologyRound out these quotes, ventur capitalist live and die by identifi the compani that will defin come wave of disruption. As such, they spend a disproportion amount of time think about the current and futur state of technology. One of the key theme is that softwar will continu to autom and upend section of the economi as Marc Andreessen candidli observes:Ov the next 10 years, I expect mani more industri to be disrupt by software, with new world-beat Silicon Valley compani do the disrupt in more case than not. -- Marc AndreessenHowever, softwar isn't necessarili the onli way we should understand technolog either, as earli Facebook investor Peter Thiel notes:Th singl word for vertical, 0 to 1 progress is technology. The rapid progress of inform technolog in recent decad ha made Silicon Valley the capit of ""technology"" in general. But there is no reason whi technolog should be limit to computers. Properli understood, ani new and better way of do thing is technology. -- Peter Thiel fromZero to OneFurth thi idea, fame VC John Doerr see a truli game-chang invest opportun in one larg undisrupt area of the economy:Green-tech could be the largest econom opportun of the 21st Century. -- John DoerrSpot the next big thing is inde hard work. However, as the world' most success ventur capitalist have demonstr time and again, do so is inde possible. Similarly, investor in public market compani that follow thi same line of reason can also do extrem well over the long term. Integr these abov idea to your research process should certainli help increas your odd of success investing.10 stock we like better than Wal-MartWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

There' no fundament advantag an instal likeTesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) ha in financ solar versu a bank, and in mani way it may have a disadvantage. And solar manufactur may not be the best at build massiv power plants, someth util and independ power produc have decad of experi doing. So, what' the trend to watch in 2017? Solar compani are offer an integr product design that custom can instal more effici than the piecem design of the past.makeArticleAd();Imag source: Getti Images.Back away from the financ gameOn of the broad trend over the past five year in the solar industri is that solar compani began to financ more of their own projects. Small-system instal like Tesla' Solar,Sunrun(NASDAQ: RUN) , andVivint Solar(NYSE: VSLR) could offer simpl leas or power purchas agreement (PPA) financ with $0 for custom and then aggreg the tax benefit and payment in larg financ projects. For bigger project like whatFirst Solar(NASDAQ: FSLR) andSunPower(NASDAQ: SPWR) were building, self-financ elimin a discount buyer demand for take on project risk and allow them to take advantag of fall financ costs.If there wa one broad financ trend in 2016, it wa that solar compani financ their own project began to backfire. Small project began to be financ through loan as more bank and small lender emerged, lower the cost of capit for customers. And rise yield on yieldco like8point3 EnergyPartners(NASDAQ: CAFD) made self-financ less attract becaus the price a yieldco would pay for a project began to decline. For larg developers, hold project on the balanc sheet suddenli becam a bad thing and now they'r look to sell project befor construct even begins, leav financ risk to a compani better suit to accept that risk.Design entir system will be the name of the gameIn respons to these financ trends, major solar compani are begin to design off-the-shelf solut for solar develop and utilities. The develop will then take care of thing like financ and secur power purchas agreements, while the solar compani concentr on design solar system to maxim energi product and lower cost. In some cases, they'r even ad servic beyond solar, like energi storage.Imag source: SunPower.Thi shift can be seen in First Solar and SunPower' product line changes. First Solar is upgrad from Seri 4 solar panel to Seri 6, which is a full panel and rack system with the option of ad energi storag and function all the way to transmission. SunPower' Oasi system is a complet solut from site select to build a power plant with tracker and the P-Seri solar panels. Both solut are essenti off-the-shelf offer the compani will provid to a varieti of custom around the world. And it mean in mani place they'll be back away from bid on project themselv in mani locations.SunPower' residenti and commerci solar solut follow along the same lines. Known as Equinox and Helix, respectively, they are a solut instal can buy pre-design and just instal on a rooftop.Tesla ha been move to thi model for years. It bought Zep Solar to bring a rack product in-house, bought Silevo to begin manufactur solar panels, and now Tesla' acquisit of SolarC bring both product togeth with energi storage. Now, Tesla will be make most of the valuabl compon of the solar system. And it' move toward more sale through loans, back away from leas and PPAs.Solar solut are the next big thingMov toward more complet solut make sens for the solar industri becaus it help move more cost from the field to the factory, where compon can be built effici and design to work seamlessli together. The day of piecem design of solar system are come to an end.Th compani that can combin solar solut design with differenti product like high-effici solar panel will be well posit for the future. Bottom line: SunPower, First Solar, and Tesla have a leg up on the competit in build out the solar product solut of the future.10 stock we like better than Wal-MartWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

What To Expect From BlackBerry's Software Unit In 2017,12/28/2016,"2017 will be all about softwar for BlackBerri (BBRY), as the firm shut down it hardwar oper to focu on brand licensing, while it servic access busi becom increasingli irrelevant, amid user attrit from it legaci smartphon platforms. Below we take a look at what to expect from BlackBerry' software-focus busi go into next year.Trefi ha an$8 price estim for BlackBerry, which is roughli 15% ahead of the current market price.Se our complet analysi for BlackBerri heremakeArticleAd();Enterpris Mobil Manag And SecurityBlackBerry' softwar and servic revenu stood at $486 million for the first nine month of FY'17 (fiscal year end in February), mark a 29% increas on a year-over-year basis. Enterpris mobil manag remain the key driver of sales, with ~9300 new enterpris subscrib addit over the first nine month of the fiscal year. The EMM market is expect to grow from$1.76 billion in 2016 to over $4.5 billion by 2020, driven by mount electron secur concern and an increas shift from PC to mobil devices, which are often employee-owned. BlackBerri could outgrow the market, given that it recent took step to unifi it variou enterpris mobil and secur offer under the ""BlackBerri Secure"" umbrella, enabl it to provid end-to-end secur solutions, while help custom lower total cost of ownership (related: What BlackBerri Aim To Achiev With It Latest Secur Offering). Moreover, roughli ~80% of BlackBerry' softwar and servic revenue, exclud patent licens and profession services, are now recur after the firm transit to a licens model for it EMM software. Thi should result in revenu growth as recent subscrib add are monetized.Emerg Busi Can Gain Traction, But Competit Like To Be IntenseTh rel revenu stabil in the enterpris softwar space is give BlackBerri headroom to expand it other software-ori busi such as connect vehicl and Internet of Things. The compani recent sign an agreement to work directli with Ford Motor Compani to expand it use of BlackBerri QNX and secur software. The deal, which effect make BlackBerri a Tier-1 supplier to the auto behemoth, could pave the way for more deal with auto manufactur go forward (related: Whi BlackBerry' Softwar Deal With Ford Is Promising). BlackBerri is also bet big on the car of the future, launch an Innov Center for Connect and Autonom Vehicles, with plan to hire over 600 engin for thi effort in the near term. While the final product may be a few year away, competit in the space is like to be intense, with deep-pocket Silicon Valley player such as Appl (AAPL), Tesla (TSLA) and Googl (NASDQ:GOOG, GOOGL) invest heavili in their own respect platforms.BlackBerry' IoT busi is also slowli come to fruition. The company' Radar solution, which cater to the fleet manag market, saw some busi develop activ thi year, win contract with truck firm includ Caravan Transport Group in Canada and Titanium Transport in the U.S. , while carri out a few other pilot deployments. However, the fleet manag market is veri fragmented, with competit onli like to get more intens with wireless behemoth Verizon doubl down on the space with it $2.4 billion purchas of market leader Fleetmat earlier thi year. Larger player are like to benefit from greater economi of scale and better network effects, pose a threat to BlackBerry.Look For Greater Transpar In 2017While the growth in BlackBerry' Softwar busi is unlik to make up for the loss of revenu from the smartphon and SAF businesses, the greater mix of high gross margin softwar revenu should help BlackBerri improv it profitability. That said, there are some concern relat to a lack of transpar for the softwar unit. Although softwar is like to account for roughli two-third of BlackBerry' 2017 revenues, per our estimates, BlackBerri ha not been break down it variou software-rel revenu streams, leav some uncertainti from a forecast standpoint. Moreover, we will be look for the compani to provid other metric such as subscrib figures, averag revenu per subscrib and churn rates, which are typic of firm provid Saa product with recur revenues.Interact Institut Research (Power by Trefis):Glob Larg Cap|U.S. Mid & Small Cap|European Larg & Mid CapMor Trefi Research"

How Tesla Can Succeed in Solar in 2017,12/28/2016,"WhenTesla Motor Inc(NASDAQ: TSLA) bought SolarC thi fall, it mark a big strateg shift for the company. Tesla is no longer just a supplier of batteri to rooftop solar instal like SolarCity; it is now a full-fledg solar company.SolarC employ ten of thousand of peopl sell and instal solar systems, and it is also build a manufactur plant and ha a larg financ arm that handl billion of dollar in solar financ deals. Thi make Tesla a complic player in solar energy, but there are three way it can realli differenti itself from it peer in 2017.makeArticleAd();Imag source: Tesla.Manufactur ha to live up to expectationsTesla CEO Elon Musk and SolarC have spent two year talk about make solar cell and panels, and in 2017, the rubber ha to hit the road. When SolarC bought Silevo in 2014 and began construct on a 1 gigawatt (GW) solar panel manufactur plant in New York, the thought wa that SolarC could be a technolog leader as well as a sale and instal giant. It' been a difficult process, to say the least.Silevo ha yet to produc solar panel at scale, and when Tesla bought SolarCity, one of the impact wa that Panason would be brought in to help with solar manufacturing. None of the compani ha said a lot about what the detail of Panasonic' involv will be, but the fact that a third parti would have to be brought in is concerning. And the time to make effici advanc befor competitor do is come to a close.SolarC thought it could make cell that were 22% effici with Silevo technology, which would lead to 19% to 20% effici modules. That would be an advance, but with mono-PERC technolog -- which will have high teen effici -- start to be roll out by Chines manufacturers, there' not a huge advantag to thi product SolarCity/Silevo hasn't even proven it can make. And industri leaderSunPower(NASDAQ: SPWR) is alreadi produc cell that are 25.1% effici and modul over 23% efficiency, so the Tesla/SolarCity/Silevo group is fall behind and ha to catch up fast.Then there' the solar roof, which is a great headlin but mostli a mysteri right now. We don't know price, efficiency, or anyth about installation, so it' tough to say whether that product will impact Tesla in 2017.What' clear is that Tesla ha to get solar manufactur right thi year. If it can, it will have a high-effici product with tradit solar panel and potenti a compel new product with the solar roof.Ditch relianc on the leaseIn 2016, the residenti solar industri came to the quick realiz that third-parti financ from the lease/pow purchas agreement (PPA) won't be the domin paradigm forever. More loan financ is come avail and custom want the choic that come with self-select everyth from panel to financing.Thi take away a key differenti for SolarCity, which ha been abl to leverag it size to lower financ cost for it lease/PPA. Now, the compani need to make the transit to loans, and fast. But there' opportun here.Larg instal are fairli slow in make big chang to their busi model and Tesla can be a leader in move to the loan. If it does, it could mean more upfront cash gener from solar, which would fund solar manufactur and even the Model 3 expansion. Loan could be a boon for Tesla in 2017 if it make a big transit and leav it third-parti financ model behind.Imag source: Tesla.Energi storag is Tesla' biggest differentiatorTh singl biggest advantag Tesla ha in solar is that it can integr design up and down the suppli chain. Solar panels, racking, inverters, and energi storag design are now all in-house, and that could allow the compani to lower cost and offer new product to customers.In 2017, I would expect energi storag with the Powerwal 2 to becom a much larger part of the business. And with the abil to integr the invert with storage, there are multipl way to creat valu for custom with energi storage. Look for the compani to leverag thi fact thi year.Th SolarC acquisit may have been a great moveNow that SolarC is part of Tesla, the compani ha to make the transit to a solar instal and manufacturer. In a highli competit industry, that may be easier said than done. But with a high-effici manufactur plant under way, scale that beat all competitors, and an integr energi storag product, Tesla could be well posit for the future. Now it just ha to execut to creat valu for sharehold and customers.10 stock we like better than Tesla MotorsWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Tesla Leans on Panasonic to Build Solar Panels in Buffalo Plant,12/27/2016,"Tesla Motor Inc(NASDAQ: TSLA) is make good on it promis to bring in Panason to help with solar manufacturing, now that Tesla' acquisit of SolarC is complete. The compani announc on Tuesday that Panason will invest $256 million in SolarCity' Buffalo, New York, manufactur facility, with a goal of start product in the summer of 2017.The hope is that the partnership will bring higher-effici solar panel to SolarC and Tesla, and a greater level of integration. But the idea that Panason wa need in the first place is a bit of a mystery.makeArticleAd();Imag source: Getti Images.Whi Panason is neededIn June 2014, SolarC announc the acquisit of Silevo, a solar technolog start-up that hope to make high-effici solar panel in a plant in Buffalo, New York. To pay for the plant, SolarC got the state to throw in a $750 million subsidi in exchang for commit to meet minimum invest and hire worker in the state. It seem like SolarC wa on it way to becom a solar manufactur giant, with a target of product begin in 2016.But in the summer of 2016, as part of the acquisit of SolarCity, Tesla announc plan to bring in Panason to make solar cell use technolog similar to Silevo's. It seem that Silevo' technolog wasn't work out as plan -- if it were, Panason wouldn't be need at the plant at all.It now appear that Panason will essenti take over cell manufactur use it own technology, which add a thin amorph silicon layer to the cell to increas efficiency. What' interest about move to thi technolog is that Panason suspend oper at a solar-cel plant in Osaka, Japan, becaus of weak demand. If the technolog wa a true differenti on effici at competit costs, the compani could have look outsid Japan to market like the U.S., where high effici is in high demand. But Panasonic' technolog wasn't differenti enough to thrive on the open market, so it' interest that Tesla chose Panason as the partner for Buffalo.Tesla ha a bigger plan for solar cellsTesla hope the Buffalo plant will help advanc higher-effici solar panel that pack more power gener into each rooftop solar install, and will provid cell for Tesla' solar roof. Thi will also further vertic integr the manufactur business. Tesla now design and make solar panels, roof racking, and an energi storag product with an inverter. In theory, have develop of these product under one roof should make for a more seamless design and instal for Tesla.For Tesla to differenti itself from competitor in solar, thi integr will be key. And the Buffalo facil could be where Tesla' solar vision come together.Tesla ha a lot to prove in solarSay you'r go to make a high-effici solar panel or a solar roof is one thing, but actual do it is appar prove more difficult than Elon Musk and SolarC had planned. Panason wouldn't have been ask to invest $256 million in the Buffalo solar facil if Silevo' technolog were work as expected. And we still don't have confirm that solar panel come from the facil will be higher-effici than those from competitors, or cost-competitive.Mak solar panel is easier said than done. Tesla bring in Panason show that Silevo/SolarCity/Tesla are find that out the hard way.10 stock we like better than Tesla MotorsWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

This Is Why Under Armour Inc (UA) Stock Could Have a Bang-Up Year,12/27/2016,"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsIt' been a decidedli tough year for athlet apparel makers, and despit make sever strateg move to set itself up for the future,Und Armour Inc(NYSE:UA, NYSE:UAA) wa no exception.Source:SandyDov via Flickr (Modified)UAA stock is down nearli 30% on the year, and the firm' Class C share have lost a whop 40% in 2016.makeArticleAd();Look at those figures, you might think you were deal with a compani that ha veri littl hope for the future, but in fact Under Armour appear to have a rel bright future, make it a good buy at it current valuation.What Happen to UA StockA few key event led to UA stock' declin over the past year, but the major of them are unlik to keep share of Under Armour depress for long.In earli December, Under Armour' ticker symbol chang and that contribut to the declin in the stock price as investor shi away from the compani due to confus over which share were which and question regard management' decis to have three separ share classes.10 Best Stock for Retir InvestorsBack in April, UA introduc a new C class of stock with the ticker symbol UA.C. These share had all the same econom valu as the A class shares, but sharehold would have no vote rights. CEO Kevin Plank also creat a third class of B stock that doe carri vote rights, but onli he hold these shares. Essenti what the stock split did wa allow UA to issu new stock without Plank give up hi major stake in the company.If thi wasn't confus enough, Under Armour thenrenamedit' class C share to just ""UA"" rather than ""UA.C,"" and the A share (which use to be name ""UA"") becam ""UAA"" at the begin of December.Whil it wa a contribut factor, confus wasn't the entir reason that UA stock tumbl thi year. Under Armour also face some pretti worri headwind that caus investor to second guess whether the compani could remain relev in the year to come.Perhap the most worri event wa the bankruptci and closur of Sport Authority, which hit UA hard becaus the distributor wa Under Armour' largest seller. Sport Authority' troubl hurt UA' bottom line and weigh on investor sentiment. Mani point to the bankruptci as a sign of thing to come within the sector.Finally, despit a third-quart earnings-beat, Under Armour' result were less than perfect. The firm' margin declin and third-quart sale growth wa at a six-year low. Fourth-quart guidanc suggest that the final quarter' sale growth would be even slower as well.Whi You Should Buy UA StockWith three major event contribut to UA and UAA stock' declin in 2016, there' a lot of reason to believ that thing are look bright for the new year. Even without consid all the thing that UA ha done to set itself up for a profit future, UA stock is pois to gain.UA' loss result from investor confus over the stock split and new ticker symbol are unlik to have a last impact. As the confus begin to fade, UA stock will stabilize.Thi is especi true for the C class shares, which are a great buy as they are trade at a discount. The vote right that make A share more valuabl are neglig for traders, as Plank ha major control no matter what, so C share are a good buy for investor who see UA improv in the come year.Th Sport Author closur wa certainli a blow to UA' momentum, but it doesn't signal an athletic-wear apocalyps as mani trader feared. It' worrying, but other similar retail likeDick Sport Good Inc(NYSE:DKS) are stillthriving, so it isn't time to panic about the industry' stabil just yet.UA' sale issu are also a concern, but the compani isn't in danger of fall apart, so a few difficult quarter shouldn't be reason to write UA stock off completely. Sale have improv by at least 20% everi quarter for nearli a decade, and that is a pretti posit sign of stability.Bett Day Ahead for UAOnc you'v address the three biggest reason UA stock is down in the dumps, the case for a mark increas in the next year look promising. Not onli are some of the market' worri about Under Armour overdone, but the firm ha also made some strateg move thi year that have put it in a good posit for 2017.One of the biggest move the compani made thi year wa step into the athleisur market. Athlet wear ha made it' way into the closet of just about everyon whether or not they'v ever set foot in the gym. Under Armour' product line ha alway been aim at athlet with cloth that is design for perform rather than style.However, the firmrec unveileda new line of apparel that focus on casual athlet wear for the masses. Thi is a segment that is like to continu grow in the come year, so it' promis to see UA throw it hat in the athleisur ring. Thi push into casual-wear is like to be support by Under Armour' new partnership withKohl' Corporation(NYSE:KSS), anoth big factor to watch in the come year.Th Bottom LineUA stock is a buy for investor look to add to their portfolio in the come year. The stock' major declin in 2016 ha been the result of the market' overreact to some challeng that the compani is facing.Should I Buy Tesla Motor Inc (TSLA) Stock? 3 Pros, 3 ConsNot onli can investor expect much of that downsid to fade in the come year, but UA' latest foray into casual wear is like to give the stock a further boost.A of thi writing, Laura Hoy did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlaceTh 12 Best Fidel 401k Fund to Own10 ""Best of the Best"" Stock to Buy for 2017The postThi Is Whi Under Armour Inc (UA) Stock Could Have a Bang-Up Yearappear first onInvestorPlace."

In 2016, Tesla had a rang of $144 to $265 - with the year-to-d loss come to 8%. That' disappoint consid the market have end the year on a veri bullish note. It' import to keep in mind, however, that Tesla stock ha had a long run of strong gains. Dure the past five years, compound annual growth hit a stagger 50%.10 Best Stock for Retir InvestorsSo what kind of opportun are we look at with Tesla stock? Well, to see, let' consid three pro and con on Tesla stock.TSLA Stock ProsInnovation:Tesla Motor ha made major breakthrough in batteri technolog (allow for drive of over 300 mile on a singl charge), electr powertrain and softwar systems. Yet the compani ha also been innov with it busi model, such as have onlin purchas of vehicl as well company-own showroom and servic centers. The result is that Tesla ha direct connect with it custom and better control on qualiti service.Interestingli enough, a Tesla car is kind of like an app. That is, there are period updat to the system with""over-the-air""transmissions. Thi ha definit been key with the Autopilot technology, which allow for semi-autonom driver assistance. So is it ani wonder thatForbescurr rank Tesla asth world' most innov company? Not really.Megatrend:Th auto industri is in the midst of major technolog changes. Compani likeAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG),Qualcomm, Inc.(NASDAQ:QCOM) andIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) have made big invest and acquisit in the category. Of course, the main focu is on autonom driving. Accord to research fromMobiley NV(NYSE:MBLY), the market could hit$15 billionwithin the next few years.Al thi is certainli good news for holder of TSLA stock. The compani ha been invest in new-fangl auto technolog sinc 2003. What' more, the Autopilot hardwar ha log over 1.3 billion mile so far. In other words, Tesla ha a major advantag in term of data and analytics. But the growth is like to ramp for some time. For the second half of 2016, TSLA expect to ship50,000 cars, which is roughli the same amount for all of last year.Th Elon Factor:At 45, Musk is alreadi a legend of the tech industry. Besid Tesla, he ha launch other breakout companies, such as Zip2,Payp Hold Inc(NASDAQ:PYPL), SolarC and SpaceX. Along the way, Musk ha made billion for shareholders. Unlik mani in Silicon Valley, though, he is not onli technic super smart but ha incred market chops. Oh, and he is not afraid of ""go big."" Let' face it, how mani peopl have the goal of eventu live on Mars? Such qualiti have inspir Musk' workforce, which ha led to amaz achievements.TSLA Stock ConsSolarC Deal:OnTwitt Inc(NYSE:TWTR), Musk sent out thefollowingregard the acquisition: ""Tesla + SolarC future: solar roof + batteri + electr cars."" Definit ambitious, right? Of course. But there ha still been quit a bit of skeptic on the Street.On of the issu is that SolarC ha been a big-tim money loser. For the past year, the compani ha report nearly$2 billion in neg oper cash flows. Keep in mind that there are heavi capit cost and market expenditures. The competit environ is also intens and there are concern that the regulatori environ could get tougher. Let' face it, the Donald Trump Administr may not be too interest in maintain tax credit for solar energi projects.In light of all this, analyst at Morgan Stanley provid the followinggrim assessment: ""Given (SolarCity's) financi condit and recent reduct in guidance, we have assum zero valu for (SolarCity) equiti to (Tesla) shareholders.""Valuation:Even with the recent drop, TSLA stock is still far from cheap. The multipl is at about six time sales. No doubt, thi is at quit a premium to tradit auto manufacturers. Consid thatGener Motor Company(NYSE:GM) andFord Motor Company(NYSE:F) sport multipl at about 0.3 or so.It' true that the premium valuat for TSLA is due to the strong growth ramp. And there is lot of valu for the intellectu property. But then again, profit ha remain elusive. If anything, TSLA will like continu to voraci rais capit to meet product targets, build the massiv Gigafactori and fund SolarCity. In other words, there will like be ongo dilut for shareholders.Perhap thi is whi short seller have been target TSLA stock. Right now, the short interest is at a hefti 40% of the float, which certainli indic that mani investor are expect a fall in the valu of the shares.Product Issues:Demand ha not realli been a problem for Tesla. Instead, the real challeng ha been to produc enough vehicles. After all, the compani ha a limit number of facil - and technic complex are mind-boggling. It seem inevit that there will be snags. Yet the biggest problem may be to achiev profit on a unit basis. Accord to a recent 152-slide present from hedg fund managerMark Spiegel, the Tesla Model 3 could cost $48,000 to produce.

2 Big Winners in Consumer Reports' Owner Satisfaction Survey,12/27/2016,"It' easi for investor to becom complet consum by a company' financials, and that' obvious an import aspect of investing. But wise investor also pay a lot of attent to the product their compani make, becaus a product mistak or failur could send a promis company' stock crash to the ground.That' whi read through Consum Reports' Annual Owner Satisfact Survey can be realli import for auto investors: It tell us how CR subscrib feel about the car they bought. I'd much rather own a financi healthi stock that produc vehicl consum would buy again, than not.Lincoln' rebound isn't limit to sale as it consum satisfact jump thi year. Imag source: Ford Motor Company.makeArticleAd();How doe it work?CR' rank emphas owner sentiment across a brand' entir portfolio of vehicl and model satisfact is determin by the percentag of subscrib that would ""definitely"" buy the vehicl again. Also, in order to qualify, a brand must have at least two model with data and the survey focus on 2014-2017 model years. Without further ado, here are the result and some takeaways.Inform source: Consum Reports'Ownership Satisfact Survey. Chart by author.Tesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) is obvious a huge winner here as the onli brand score in the 90 percentil range, and well ahead of the next closest brand, Porsche, and that' even more impress consid the latter wa the onli brand score in the 80 percentil range. But Tesla' victori here is even more import consid the batter it' taken over the past year in regard to product issues.Th Model X' wing door caus consum frustration, and occasion issu of door not align properli aren't typic complaint for a car that can cost well into the $100,000 range. The fact that so mani Tesla consum would purchas again despit the product complaint is a huge win, and that' amplifi by the fact that it' more afford Model 3 will be launch at the end of 2017.Ford Motor Company's(NYSE: F) luxuri Lincoln brand made an impress jump for the second-largest Detroit automaker. Lincoln jump from it 21st rank in the prior CR survey, up to 12th thi year. That move Lincoln ahead of some notabl luxuri brand such as Cadillac, Mercedes-Benz, and BMW. Remember, Lincoln wa the onli brand that Ford didn't sell off amid it busi crisi in 2006, and the follow financi crisis. It' pour much capit into reviv the luxuri brand and it' now on pace for it third consecut year of sale gains, someth it hasn't accomplish in at least 16 years.Thi is a great sign for Ford investor as luxuri sale are high margin business, and increas luxuri sale at a time when new-vehicl sale are peak would be veri benefici for the automaker. If more consum are happi with the product, and would purchas again as thi survey indicates, thi suggest Lincoln' newest product are improv and that should enabl the brand' rebound to continue.Ultimately, these type of survey are more import to investor than mani realize. The automot busi is insan competitive, and it' veri costli to ""conquer"" consumers, which is lure them from a compet brand to your own. If you have a high percentag of consum remain loyal to your brand, it' simpli good business. These survey can also give a glimps of a compani that might not be produc vehicl up to standards, and that could lead to sale troubl in the near-term. TakeFiat Chrysler Automobilesfor example, which had four of it five brand place 17th or lower. Wise investor should use these survey to their advantage, and consid them while make invest decisions.10 stock we like better than Tesla MotorsWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Will Elon Musk Really Build a Tunnel Boring Company?,12/25/2016,"So here' the latest revel pull out of ""Elon Musk' box of crazi ideas."" The founder ofTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) and SpaceX ha now decid to start a compani that will dig tunnel for car to drive through.Tunnel bore machin are massiv piec of equip -- train-siz mobil factori design to dig into the Earth. Coincidentally, they'r almost perfectli shape to fit aboard a rocket to Mars. Imag source: Getti Images.W first learn of Musk' latest harebrain scheme (Get it? Rabbit dig tunnels. too!) when the Tesla CEO wa appar drive through California over the weekend, got upset with the holiday-tim traffic, and began blast out a seri of tweets:makeArticleAd();""Traff is drive me nuts,"" observ the billionaire.So mayb he should ""build a tunnel bore machin and just start digging.""H would call the compani ""The Bore Company"" -- and he is ""actual go to do this.""A hare among foxesMedia respons to the Tesla tycoon' tweet ha been mixed, withUSA Todayobserv that these may be the mere ""muse of a guy stuck in a traffic jam with time to tweet,"" andRecode.net theorizingthat Elon wa ""just venting,"" or perhap ""make a corni joke.""Others, includ some of my own colleagu here at The Motley Fool, believ that Musk is seriou about set up a ""bore company"" -- but that he' delud if he think he can make it work. After all, while the idea of bore tunnel in the earth appear to have just occur to Musk, there are plenti of other compani that have been at thi busi much longer.Just a quick survey of the tunnel bore machin (TBM) industri reveal major player in the form of:Norway' TerratecGermany' Bosch RexrothGermany' Herrenknecht, which make the TBM build out the London UndergroundJapan' Hitachi Zosen Sakai, which make the Bertha TBM current tunnel under SeattleChina Rail Engin CorporationFrance' NFM Technolog and America' The Robbin Company, both now own by China' Northern Heavi Industri GroupIf Elon Musk truli desir to enter the tunnel bore business, he' go to face some stiff competit -- competit stiff enough that it' alreadi drivenCaterpillar(NYSE: CAT) out of the business. (Caterpillar stop build TBM in 2013, and is wind down it support of exist equip at the end of thi year.) So if Musk truli is seriou about set up a tunnel bore company, he' pick himself a tough row to hoe.Crazi as a March hare -- or crazi like a fox?And yet, I actual think Muskisseri -- and what' more, I think I knowwhyhe' seriou about tunnel boring. It come down to this: Everyth -- everyth -- that Musk doe these day is done with an eye to hi dream ofon day colon Mars.Consider: Musk ha famous advoc the idea of launch satellit into orbit, and thenreus the rockets. Previously, advoc of reusabl rocket alway argu that the best way to land rocket for reus wa to fli them back to Earth and land them like an airplane, on a runway. That' how Rockwel Intern (now larg own byBoeing) design it space shuttle. That' how Boe rivalAirbusi designingit ADELIN spaceplaneto land today.Musk, however, rightli point out that on Mars, therear no runways.If you want to land a rocket on Mars, such that it can later take off again, you have to land ""on your feet."" Hence, everi rocket that Musk make at SpaceX is design to land vertically, on it own rockets.Y can make a similar point for Musk' other busi ventures, includingSolarC solar panels, Teslaelectr cars, and evensatellit internet. Mar lack oil deposits, which mean that power must be gener electr (solar panels). Mar car won't be abl to run on gasoline, so batteri power is a better option there as well (Tesla). And Mar will lack a commun system to connect potenti far-flung coloni -- so it might be a good idea to develop expertis in run a satcom network here on Earth, preparatori to creat a similar system to encircl Mars.Mak sens of Elon Musk' Bore CompanySo how do tunnel bore machin play into thi Mars-centr thesis? Simple. In the earli day of ani Mar colony, protect colonist from solar radiat will be a concern, as will construct of housing. Have tunnel bore machin on site, however, would solv both problem at once, by enabl colonist to bore radiation-proof tunnel underground in which to live.Mind you, I'm not say that thi is Musk'sonlyobject in set up a compani to build TBMs. Rather, it' hisultimateobjective.A I see it, Musk need to figur out how to build TBM -- which he can then ship to Mar by rocket, for use in set up a Mar colony. To do that, he'll want to first tinker with the idea, learn how to build TBM himself, and then perfect the technology. By set up a ""Bore Company"" on Earth, he get to do all three -- and have hi custom (and perhap even investors) pay for it.When you look at thing thi way, Musk' idea isn't nearli as crazi as it sounds.10 stock we like better than Tesla MotorsWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Legisl and regulatori chang are often push through just befor the end of the year, which ha had a huge impact on the solar industri in year past.2016 is no different, and there are some signific polici chang take place right now. But thi time solar energi may be come out on top. Here' a look at those polici chang and some other notabl item from the week in solar energy.makeArticleAd();Imag source: Getti Images.A record year for U.S. solarDespit solar stocks' perform on the market, the industri had a record year in 2016. The U.S. Energi Inform Administr (EIA) say that 9.5 GW of utility-scal solar will be instal in the U.S. thi year, enough to power 1.5 million homes. That top 8.0 GW of new natur ga plant and 6.8 GW of new wind power.If you add in distribut solar generation, which the EIA doesn't account for, the figur jump to 11.2 GW or 14 GW of DC power generation,accord to GTM Research. The futur is bright for solar energy, and as the biggest sourc of new power gener in the country, it' final a power player in electr generation.St can't figur out what to do with solarTh rooftop solar industri is veri depend on state and regul polici drive the econom of solar systems. Under net metering, custom onli pay for their net energi usage, mean they'r effect ""paid"" the retail rate for energi they export to the grid. Not surprisingly, util have tri to undercut that econom model in a varieti of way over the last few years.Thi week, Arizona undercut net meter by lower the rate custom are paid for electr sent to the grid, and cut down the amount of time rate are guaranteed. Thi reduc the known payback of a solar system and could make it difficult to justifi rooftop solar.In Nevada, the state that elimin net meter a year ago in a veri punit way to the solar industry, the Public Util Commiss unanim approv util Sierra Pacif Power' bid to restor net meter in the northern part of the state. Thi is a big revers in Nevada, and may show that regul went too far in their rule last year.Util in the southwestern U.S. are find themselv in a difficult posit as the cost of rooftop solar fall and energi storag becom more viable. They'r tri to undercut the econom of solar, but by do so they'r make solar plu storag a viabl option for self-consumption. It' no coincid that thi is the yearTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) andSunrun(NASDAQ: RUN) introduc new or improv energy-storag products. Util are have a hard time find a balanc between fight rooftop solar and fight so hard they push custom toward solar plu storage. And that conflict is play out in plain sight in Arizona and Nevada right now.New and notesHer are a few notabl item from around the solar industry.Trina Solar(NYSE: TSL) said thi week that it hit a new effici record of 22.61% for a monocrystallin silicon PERC cell. Mono-PERC, as it' more commonli known, is an up-and-com technolog that will like gain market share in the next few years, so be in a leadership posit is good for the company.SunPower(NASDAQ: SPWR) said it complet a 20 MW power plant for the Sulphur Spring Valley Electr Cooper thi week. The project complet itself isn't surprising, but buri in the releas is that 0.5 MW of the instal wa the company' Oasi 3.0 platform that wa launch in September. Put the system in the ground will both give SunPow the chanc to test instal it, and allow data to be collect from the project. Sinc it is probabl the company' most import product over the next five years, thi is an import test site for the company.Priv compani 8minutenergi Renew also complet a 155 MW project that it say beat fossil-fuel price and is the lowest-cost solar power to date. The $58 per MWh it is charg the Lo Angel Depart of Water and Power for electr over a 30-year power purchas agreement is impressive, and it' just one exampl of low-cost solar in the U.S. New contract are go for less than $50 per MWh, and 2017 could see price below $40 per MWh, which would make solar energi lower-cost than fossil fuel in most of the country.10 stock we like better than Wal-MartWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Do Lithium Stocks Belong in Your Portfolio?,12/23/2016,"Imag source: Getti Images.Th case for lithium stock seem simpl enough. The world is ad new portabl electr devic at an incred pace. Just about everi major automak ha at least announc plan for introduc an electr vehicl to the market within a matter of years. A littl compani calledTeslai move forward on construct of a Gigafactori that will produc an enorm number of batteri for auto and home-scal energi storag -- it expect to produc as mani lithium-ion batteri in 2018 as were manufactur on the whole planet in 2013. Phones, laptops, power tools, wearables, drone -- it seem everyth and anyth is take advantag of advanc in lithium-ion technology.makeArticleAd();That mean lithium stock belong in your portfolio, right? As is usual the case, the detail of the market make thi simpl argument a littl more complicated. Here are a few thing investor will want to consid befor throw money at the compani suppli thi headline-grab metal.Th lithium market by the numbersEveryon think of batteri when they think of lithium. However, while that is by far the fastest-grow use for the metal, batteri onli account for about one-third of the total lithium market. They onli becam the largest categori of consumpt last year, when they move ahead of ceram and glass.Imag source:USGS.Counterintuitively, global product of lithium ore hasn't grown all that much in recent years, although mine compani are plan on major output increas in the near future. The U.S. Geolog Survey conclud that 2013 output top out at 34,000 metric tons, then fell to 31,700 metric ton in 2014. Product of raw ore is estim to have grown by just 500 metric ton in 2015.Sluggish product growth is not a matter of scarcity. Global output could tripl and known reserv would still last about 135 years. The question iswheth or not lithium supplier can keep up(mor on that below) with rise demand. Thi should be the focu of investor interest in lithium stocks.Lithium market structureTher are plenti of tiny, zero-revenu stock out there claim to have vast reserv of untap lithium ore. These are the crazi Uncl Joe of the market. Smile, nod, and then turn your attent to the supplier with real market share.Albemarl Corp.(NYSE: ALB) ,Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile(NYSE: SQM) , andFMC Corp.(NYSE: FMC) own a combin 70% of the global lithium market. China' Tianqi Lithium own anoth 16%. These divers specialti chemic compani buy up the right to unmin lithium and convert it into more refin grade that are suitabl for downstream customers, such as batteri manufacturers.Thes compani are onli real way to gain exposur to the market. There is no reliabl pure play lithium stock. Whi not? Mine lithium is an aw slow and labori operation.Consid that some 80% of global lithium reserv are to be found in salt brine in South America, name Chile and Argentina, with over half of the world' reserv resid in the former. Get the raw lithium out of brine requir multipl concentration, extraction, and purif step to separ out variou other metal impurities. The first step alon -- solar evapor pond -- takesfour months. The next sever step are energi and consum intensive, which hike the cost of production.Imag source:Outotec.To put it anoth way: Uncl Joe isn't go to make it in lithium mining. The process is long and expensive, which prevent supplier from respond rapidli to shift in demand. Onli larg compani such as Albemarle, SQM, and FMC have the financi power to withstand volatility, diversifi their suppli chains, and make the necessari invest to creat high grade lithium materi for industri customers. Of course, market volatil ha work in their favor in the last year.Suppli and demandNow that I'v convinc you to stay away from microcap lithium stocks, you'r readi to load up on the blue chips. After all, the grow demand for batteri and the sluggish rise in raw ore output (a year-over-year increas in output of just 500 metric tons) must give the four major market player the upper hand in negoti suppli deal with batteri manufacturers, right?Sort of.ALBdata byYChartsIt goe without say that lithium is pretti import in lithium-ion batteries. But, counterintuitively, the lithium doe not have a signific impact on the cost of lithium-ion batteries. In fact, it' actual the smallest mass and cost compon of the batteri cells. Earlier thi year, two research at Carnegi Mellon Univers did a studi that play around with the price of lithium carbon (raw lithium ore), use a base price of $7.50 per kilogram. Drop the price to $0 and increas it to $25 per kilogram -- an increas of 233% --chang the cost of batteri by less than 10%.In other words, there isn't much bargain power to gain from keep the market undersupplied, but the lengthi product process for lithium ha kept suppli lag behind demand in the last sever years. That ha result in rise prices, which have been a boon for the Big Four in 2016. Here' how lithium contribut to the financ of Albemarl and FMC for the first nine month of 2016:MetricAlbemarleFMCRevenue, lithium$689.9 million*$193.5 million% of Total Revenue34.8%*8%Income, lithium$186.3 million (net income)*$48.9 million**% of Total Income32.6% (net income)*12.1%***Includ other materials. **Incom befor taxes. Source: SEC filings.In it financi reports, Albemarl lump lithium sale in with other advanc materi it sells, but lithium is clearli drive the segment. The year-over-year sale increas for the segment wa all from favor condit in the lithium market, which offset declin revenu from other products. FMC ha seen a signific leap in lithium sale compar to 2015, too, and ha announc major expans plan to increas output befor the end of the decade.Keep in mind that the lengthi product process is a double-edg sword. If demand for raw lithium suddenli craters, perhap in a global econom downturn or from the emerg of new mine technology, then major supplier will be nearli two quarter behind the market' appetite. A similar scenario could unfold if other major mine or chemic compani decid to invest in product or the overal suppli chain. Either case could crash price and the incom statement of lithium stock in one fell swoop. That doesn't appear like at the moment, but similar scenario have play out mani time in commod market when no one saw it come in advance. (See: fertilizers, crude oil, and the like.)Do lithium stock belong in your portfolio?Investor will want to take the issu outlin abov into consider befor make a decis to gain exposur to lithium, either directli through a supplier such as Albemarl or indirectli through an ETF. In the end, the lithium market is more complex than most peopl realize. I'm firmli in the camp that think lithium stock are simpli the flavor the week for Mr. Market and do not repres a long-term buy opportunity. Perhap when suppli chain matur and price reach more of an equilibrium, I'll reconsid my position. But for now, lithium stock do not belong in my portfolio.10 stock we like better than FMCWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

3 Reasons NVIDIA Corporation Stock Could Rise,12/22/2016,"NVIDIA(NASDAQ: NVDA) ha made some impress move in 2016 that have won the compani a lot of analyst attent and upgrad -- and right so. The company' abil to challeng industri giant to grow in mani of the most excit and potenti high-growth sector in the tech market could lead to much more growth in the future.

NVIDIA' autom drive technolog is quickli becom one of the industri standards, and NVIDIA ha now sign deal with variou car compani to get it infotain and driverless technolog in new gener of connect cars. More big partnership like these in 2017 are like to also send the stock higher.NVIDIA technolog in a MINI Cooper. Imag source: NVIDIA.2. VR adoptionOth than autonom cars, virtual realiti (VR) ha been a hot topic in the tech industri in 2016. It potenti use in person media, video games, and even video conferenc for busi meet ha led analyst atDigi-Capitalto predict that the industri could be worth $120 billion by 2020.That would be great news for NVIDIA, which is alreadi one of the most import name in the space for provid high-pow graphic chip for computers, and especi laptops, to make them VR-ready. Earlier thi year, onli a small fraction of laptop had VR capabilities, but NVIDIA is quickli chang that by roll out graphic processor for laptop that are close the gap with desktop -- a good sign for game and VR adoption. To speed thing up, NVIDIA recent start offer a bundl of free VR game when user buy NVIDIA graphic hardware. Get some good number on how much thi VR trend is adopt in 2017 should provid analyst reason to upgrad thi portion of NVIDIA' business.3. Anoth earn beatIn NVIDIA' most recent quarter, the compani post earn per share of $0.83, far ahead of analyst expectations, that sent the stock surging. Thi is noth new for thi high-perform compani that consist beat on earn and get a share price bump each time.NVDAdata byYCharts.It will get harder and harder for the compani to keep make these kind of earn beat sinc analyst will start to consid so much growth the norm for NVIDIA and begin increas their forecast for the next quarter. Already, Q4 estim are high, but if histori is ani indication, NVIDIA could veri well beat those again, which would like send the stock higher.Should you wait for a pullback in 2017?NVIDIA ha had an incred 2016, both in term of smart move made by the company, and also by share price growth, which is up 220% so far in 2016. NVIDIA stock now trade at 67 time earnings, and it ha quickli becom one of the most expens compani in it sector. As we'v seen time and time again, that could mean a slight pullback in the year ahead at the first sign of growth slow as the compani matures.Still, if you want to buy in but are wait for a pullback, consid that share are trade at just 39 time next year' earn estim becaus of how quickli earn are expect to keep growing, mean if the compani perform on the bottom line throughout 2017, it could gain substanti befor ani pullback. Therefore, it' probabl better to take the long approach with thi compani and invest for where it might grow to in the next five or 10 years.10 stock we like better than NvidiaWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

This Deal Is Another Reason to Take Lucid Motors Seriously,12/21/2016,"Silicon Valley electric-car start-up Lucid Motor said it ha enter a ""strateg suppli agreement"" with South Korean giantLG Chem(NASDAQOTH: LGCLF) for lithium-ion batteri cell for Lucid' upcom electr luxuri sedan, the Air.Th news wa someth of a surprise, as it follow an announc earlier thi month of a similar deal between Lucid and LG Chem' huge rival, the Samsung SDI unit ofSamsung Electronics(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF). But if anything, it' one more reason investor interest in electr car should be watch Lucid' effort closely.makeArticleAd();Lucid Motor hope to begin product of it first car, the Air luxuri sedan, by the end of 2018. Imag source: Lucid Motors.What Lucid said about the LG Chem dealIn a statement, Lucid said the new agreement ""establish LG Chem ason ofth key supplier of cell for Lucid' products"" (emphasi added). The cylindr batteri cell LG Chem will produc for Lucid use a ""proprietari chemistry"" develop jointli by the two companies.Lucid' statement directli acknowledg the exist relationship with Samsung SDI:Lucid ha recent announc a separ batteri cell suppli agreement with Samsung SDI. Although both suppli agreement are intend for Lucid' first vehicle, there are other possibl applic for these cells. These could includ batteri develop for other compani as part of Lucid' powertrain suppli business, or variant of the sedan with specif perform requirements. The differ perform attribut avail from the two cell supplier provid Lucid with maximum flexibl to select the best cell for each application.Lucid ha veri high expect for the cell that are use in our batteries, and we are fortun to have two compani that are will and abl to work with us to meet our requirements.So, what' go on here?Two deal with two heavyweight rivalsIn one sense, it' not surpris that Lucid would seek a deal with LG Chem, which is alreadi an establish player in the still-new market for lithium-ion cell for automot applications. Most notably, it suppli the cell (and some other parts) forGener Motors'(NYSE: GM)Chevrolet Bolt EV, and it ha been aggress build product capac and seek other client around the world. (The Bolt' cell use a differ proprietari chemistri own by GM.)Of course, we could make a similar case for Samsung SDI. Samsung, which ha made lithium-ion cell for consum applic for years, ramp up it electric-car effort when it acquir an automot battery-pack busi fromMagna Internationalin 2015. That wa one of sever move it ha made over the last coupl of year in an effort to build a sizabl busi as atop-ti auto-industri supplier. Samsung SDI now suppli batteri forBMW's""i"" vehicl andFiat Chrysler Automobiles' electr Fiat 500e.Simpli put, both Korean compani are establish heavyweight jockey for posit as electr vehicl becom more commonplace. Meanwhile, asid from a few hand-built prototypes, Lucid ha yet to build a singl car -- but it ha manag to get deal with both to suppli batteri for it futur products.How did Lucid do that? And why?Th answer to the ""how"" may be found in Lucid' history. The compani now known as Lucid Motor wa origin call Atieva, and it wa origin found in 2007 to develop advanc batteri pack for electr vehicles. In it initi incarnation, Ateiva reportedli did electric-vehicl design and engin work for GM,Tesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) , andAudi, and it also did some work on batteri pack for electr buse in China.Ateiva' direct chang in 2014 after a big fundrais round intend to jump-start it develop of a line of electr car (and it name chang in October). But the compani retain deep expertis in batteri and batteri pack for electr car -- and possibly, as it statement about the LG Chem deal hints, for other applic as well. That' probabl whi both Samsung SDI and LG Chem were will to make deals.A for why, Lucid hasn't quit spell it out.

Could thi guidanc be overli conservative?Model X product at Tesla' factori in Fremont, California.

Self-driv hardwareJust one week befor Tesla post it third-quart result and share guidanc for it fourth quarter, the compani surprisingli announc it had begunship everi vehicl with sensor for fulli autonom driving.Whil softwar updat enabl these new vehicl to start drive themselv could be year away in mani of Tesla' markets, as the compani refin the system and wait for regulatori approval, the signific of thi updat shouldn't be overlooked. The new sensor suit includ 360-degre visibl around the car up to 250 meters, 12 improv ultrason sensor to supplement it cameras, and forward-fac radar. And these sensor are power by a new onboard comput with over 40 time the comput power of the previous-gener processor in Tesla vehicles.Fortunately, Tesla isn't make buyer wait until the self-driv updat is readi to begin let custom benefit from these sensors.

What Business Model Will Succeed in Energy Storage?,12/21/2016,"As the cost of batteries, fuel cells, and renew energi more broadli come down, it' becom clear that energi storag will be a big busi in the future. It can smooth out the variabl inher with wind and solar, provid valuabl servic to the grid, and move cheap renew energi creat dure the day to hour when it' most needed.It' becom more clear that energi storag will be valuable, like wind and solar energi a decad ago. What' not yet clear, though, is the answer as tohowenergi storag will gener valu for investors. Creat a busi model that can exploit the advantag of energi storag to make money will be key. And the industri may be peril for those on the bleed edge.makeArticleAd();Powerwal 2 on the outsid of a home. Imag source: Tesla.Wher energi storag ha valueGenerally, we know where energi storag ha value. Rocki Mountain Institut ha defin 13 valu driver from energi storage, includ self consumpt of solar, backup power, and energi arbitrag (lower electr consumpt dure high cost time and move it to low cost times). These are the itemsTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) ,Sunrun(NASDAQ: RUN) , andSunPower(NASDAQ: SPWR) have use to justifi a lot of the limit amount of energi storag that' been instal today, but those busi are essenti in pilot mode.Imag source: Rocki Mountain Institute'sTh Econom of Batteri Energi Storage.If the chart abov is correct, the bigger sourc of valu may come from the util side of the ledger. Transmiss congest relief and distribut invest deferr are two of the most valuabl use of energi storage, but they'r driven by util need and go through regulators. For developers, you can't just build a batteri and bid it into the open market without regul drive the util to buy servic from you.There' valu from energi storag for the entir grid, from util to customer, that much is clear. The question is, who pay for thi valu and how? Here' a few viabl options.Valu to the home and businessesLook at energi storag from the custom side, the justif will be all about cost reductions. For homeowners, that may be energi arbitrag in state like Hawaii and now California. Commerci custom can justifi energi storag through reduc demand charges, a fee the util charg base on peak demand even if it' onli for 15 minut per month. These are both way to lower payment to the utility, which ha caus util across the countri to chang rate structur to stem the loss of custom electr demand.A potenti way forward would be util find a way to build rate structur that allow custom to instal solar and energi storag on site, but still incorpor into the grid. Thi would keep peopl tie to the grid and creat a win-win situation. But find a solut that work for everyon won't be easy.Util see energi storag differentlyTo understand how a util see energi storag you have to go back to a utility' busi model. A utility' incent is to grow electr consumpt and increas their asset base from which to charg customers. That mean they have incent to keep custom from own energi storag and would rather own storag asset themselves.Th problem for util is if they push back too hard against custom own energi storage, the more they'll push compani to develop busi model to make energi storag economical. Thi could even push residenti custom to eventu leav the grid and commerci custom to find altern to buy electr from the tradit utility, someth that' alreadi take place in Nevada. So, util will want to creat rate structur that allow them to partner with renewables, energi storage, and customers. Thi may be easier said than done and there' no easi answer to how util should react to energi storage.Powerwal 2. Imag source: Tesla.Solar + storag may have a bright futureWhen you look at the dynamics, you can see that there are a lot of complex incent clash in energi storage. But one area where the technolog can bring valu is when combin with intermitt renew energy. Thi could take hold in distribut resourc or at the power plant level.On idea be push by solar instal is for small energi storag system in a home or business, known as a distribut energi storag asset, be compens to balanc the grid on a local level. They could store energi when it' cheap and allow the grid to draw energi when demand is high. Hundr or thousand of distribut asset could be tie togeth to creat a network of asset with the grid provid a price signal and a third parti -- like Tesla, SunPower, or Sunrun -- react to maxim the valu of their distribut assets.On the util side, we could see solar or wind project bid energi project into the grid but provid attach energi storage. Thi could reduc the volatil go to the grid, reduc the need for spin reserves, and can eas the effect ofth duck curve(a spike in demand in the late afternoon when the sun goe down and peopl get home from work). If long durat energi storag technolog improv enough we may even see solar project save energi for nighttime. That would truli be a game changer.Who will get energi storag right?You can see that creat a busi model to take advantag of energi storag will be difficult. But there are a few thing we can deduc from the state of the industri and the histori of adjac technolog like solar panels.Th first thing is that batteri manufactur and compani that don't have a discern technolog advantag won't like gener much valu for investors. Batteri are a commod and have been low margin for decades. That' whi nearli everi compani -- with the except of Tesla -- ha decid to focu onhowto use the batteri and not manufactur of batteries. The same goe for other energi storag technologies.Util will also have a hard time gener a signific amount of valu from energi storage. In some cases, they may be abl to instal storag to offset other investments, but that will mean a smaller asset base to rate base, which hurt the busi long term. There' just no clear model for util in energi storag outsid of get regul to allow them to own distribut batteri system in home and busi and, like rooftop solar, that will be a tough sell.That leav develop buy commod energi storag product and sell servic to the grid or customers. Thi is where I think the true financi opportun lies. It could take the form of residenti solar compani up-sel storag and then control it function to maxim value, make money through a fee or revenue-shar model with customers. Thi may involv aggreg thousand of energi storag system and sell the resourc into the grid, someth an aggreg could do but a homeown or singl busi couldn't. Or the solut may be as simpl as softwar to tie a batteri to the utility' price signal and then share the revenu with a batteri owner.I think the busi model to watch will be ad energi storag to anoth energi servic like solar. Solar + storag could be a compel proposit and would be an easier sell than energi storag as a stand-alon service. But that' my best estim of what will happen in the future. And like solar a decad ago, the compani that can build a viabl busi model in energi storag have a big market opportun ahead of them.10 stock we like better than AppleWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

3 Things You Should Know About the Solar Sector,12/21/2016,"The solar sector can be an entic and riski space for investors. There' tremend growth in the industri andtrillion of dollar in potenti revenue, but compani come and go rapidli as the landscap changes. Befor jump in, here are three thing everi investor should keep in mind.Imag source: Getti Images.makeArticleAd();Understand the import of extern policiesSean Williams: One of the most import thing to know about solar stock is that extern polici can have a big impact on the industry. Three realli good exampl are OPEC' policies, the EPA' policies, and U.S. Solar Invest Tax Credit.Solar panel maker thrive when there' both demand and urgenc for their products. Thi mean when fossil fuel price are high, the urgenc for consum and busi to switch to solar is there. When crude andnatur ga pricesfall, solar panel suppli can increas and the urgenc to make the transit to a green energi solut decreases. Over the past two-plu years, we'v wit solar panel suppli increas and urgenc declin as crude and natur ga have hit multi-year lows. However, with OPEC recent agre to cut product and crude price surg on the news, it' possibl we could see demand for solar begin creep back into the industry.Within the U.S., polici from the Environment Protect Agenc can certainli have an impact on the solar industry. Tougher carbon emiss regul have encourag util to switch away from coal-fir electr gener and toward alternatives, such as cleaner-burn natur ga and solar-pow systems. Of course, president-elect Donald Trump' stanc that some EPA regul and oversight should be pull back could work against the solar industri in the near-term.Finally, we have the U. Solar Invest Tax Credit (SITC), which allow for a 30% dollar-for-dollar tax credit on the cost of the panel and installation. In late 2015, the SITC wa extend through 2019, provid an impetu for American to invest in home-solar systems. The SITC will begin throttl down in 2020 befor disappear complet for consum by 2023. These subsidi can be a strong tool that encourag or discourag solar investment.A a solar industri investor you'll need to keep your eye on the polici and subsidi that could impact the valuat of the compani you own.Solar is a big growth industry, but also veri cyclicalJasonHall: Today, solar still gener a veri small percentag of total electr around the world, mean there' like to be huge growth for decad to come. Factor in an expect one-billion-person expans of the power-hungri global middl class over the next coupl of decades, and there' a wonder growth market for long-term investor to profit from. One ha to look onli at power gener in the Unit State alon to see the potential:U Primari Energi Productiondata byYCharts.However, investor must also understand the natur of the solar industry' like growth to have the best chanc at profiting. The best way to understand solar panel manufactur is that it' a wonder long-term growth industry, but it will also be highli cyclic from year to year, with ups-and-down in the short-term even as long-term demand increases. Thi is particularli true in the util and commercial/industri segments, where the amount spent on large, expens project can shift dramat up or down from year to year.At the same time, solar panel manufactur is complex, expensive, and larg a cost-driven, commod business. Thi make oper leverag critic important, and ani solar manufactur that' unabl to respond to shift in demand befor the market shift can swing from solid profit to steep loss veri quickly.For thi reason, investor must understand that:Thes cycl are inevitable.It can take time for even the best manufactur to work through those cycles.It can take time for invest to pan out, requir disciplin and patience, as well as knowledg of which manufactur have strong oper and balanc sheet stability.Solar ha a lot of potential, both as an energi sourc and an investment. But unless you'r will to put in the work and understand the industri and find the best companies, it' also an easi industri to lose a lot of money in.Flex is a mustTravi Hoium: Sean is right that polici impact the solar industry' demand more than most industries. And if we want to go more granular we could look at how polici in state like Hawaii, Nevada, and California are impact the industri on a local level.That' whi have a flexibl busi model is realli key to solar companies. Manufactur need to be abl to move suppli to where it' need all around the globe, instal need to be abl to ramp up and down depend on demand, and financ compani need to be flexibl in the product they offer.On exampl of a compani handl thi well isSunPow Corp(NASDAQ: SPWR) , the high effici solar panel manufacturer. The compani sell solar panel into nearli everi major solar market, so when Germani wa a big instal it had a presenc there and now that China is grow it ha solut there. SunPow can also go big or small, provid solut for rooftop solar custom and util look for massiv power plants. Thi doesn't guarante success, but it allow a flexibl to chang the busi as market condit necessitate.Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) subsidiari SolarC ha been on the opposit end of the spectrum. The compani is almost complet focus in the U.S. and ha tie itself to the lease/pow purchas agreement financ model. When state like Nevada chang polici the compani ha to lay off worker and shut down operations. And when custom start demand loan thi year the compani had troubl adapting, lead to multipl reduct in guidance.Th solar industri chang extrem quickli and that requir flexibl to survive.

It' Friday, Decemb 16th, and we'r do a roundup of self-driv car updates. I'm your host, Dylan Lewis, and I'm join on Skype by fool.com senior tech specialist, Daniel Sparks. Daniel, how' it going?Daniel Sparks:Good, Dylan, thank for have me on the show.Lewis:A littl blusteri over there in Colorado, huh?Sparks:Yeah, high wind warn thi morning. It' pretti crazy. Glad you can't hear it through the microphone.Lewis:Yeah, it seem like the kind of weather you might want some drive assistance, huh?Sparks:I guess so. (laughs)Lewis:So, Daniel, there' been a ton of news regard self-driv car in the past month or so. It seem like pretti much everi major player in the space ha come out with an announc of some sort. It seem like on our end, we were probabl due to do a littl check-in and see what' go on. How' that sound?Sparks:Sound good.Lewis:Th first news that I realli notic -- I mean, there were other one that came up in the past coupl weeks, but one that realli caught my attent -- wa Alphabet' self-driv car project doesn't seem to be just a project anymore. It seem like they'r emphas thi within the Alphabet hold structure.Sparks:Yeah, we saw that blog post, Waymo is what they'r call it. It'll be interest to see where they'r take this, for sure.Lewis:In that blog post, they said ""Waymo stand for a new way forward in mobility. We'r a self-driv technolog compani with a mission to make it safe and easi for peopl and thing to move around."" The TLDR here, the veri simpl explan of what' go on is, they are take the self-driv car project under Googl X and turn it into an identifi busi under Alphabet. Thi is awesome, I think, if you'r an Alphabet shareholder, becaus it show that they'r go to put a littl bit more emphasi on move thing along and not have these fun project be just that, that there' go to be a commerci element to it, and a path to that. But to me, more than anyth else, thi highlight the benefit of the Alphabet hold compani structure, and how under CFO Ruth Porat, they'v decid to take a more Wall Street-friendli look at some of the thing that are go on there at Google.Sparks:Yeah, it definit highlight the Alphabet structur that they have set up, and the benefit of it. Investor should realiz that thi isn't just some new project that they'r doing. Thi is the graduat of the self-driv car project to an actual company. Thi is realli one of the first instanc where we'v seen thi under the Alphabet structure, where we can see, where they take thi from their Googl X area, which is more just moonshot in development, is kind of how they'r make it look, and we'r realli see that with thi particular instance, and then graduat over to an actual compani and, like you said, put some pressur on it so they can start turn it into a business.Lewis:Yeah, and thi is, like you said, not someth that happen overnight. The self-driv car project ha been in the works, I believe, for over eight year at thi point. My read on thi -- and you can correct me if I'm wrong here, Daniel -- is, we'r not realli go to be see actual financi on Waymo broken out when Alphabet give it quarterli numbers, at least not anytim soon. It seem like they will probabl continu to be lump into other bet report for the forese future.Sparks:Yeah, I definit think they'r go to keep it in other bets, becaus with Google' revenu at the $22.2 billion and the other bet revenu at about $200 million, virtual all of the company' profit come from the core Googl segments, and nearli a $1 billion loss come from other bet -- I don't think Alphabet is ready, just becaus Waymo is turn into a company, to start segment out thi inform on it own. Not onli would it probabl draw attent to simpli a lose segment, sinc they haven't realli monet thi servic yet, and like we said, that' kind of the purpos of it. And, also, it could potenti give competitor an edg that they don't realli need to let competitor have, by look into their business. Thi is veri small to their business, they don't have to report it to investors. It' not materi at all, so they might as well keep it under wrap as long as they can.Lewis:Yeah. So, while we won't have a ton of financi insights, it seems, what I think thi doe open the door to is some question and mayb a littl bit more point commentari from manag in some of those quarterli call and mayb some of those press releas on specif what' go on with the self-driv car project. Again, probabl not someth we'r go to get a ton of insight into immediately, but someth that in the come quarter and years, we should definit expect to hear more from.Sparks:Definitely.Lewis:On of the other thing we got some color on regard Google' self-driv car project, I guess I should be call it Waymo now, is exactli how they plan to monet self-driv car technology. Thi is someth that' been kind of up in the air for a while. At times, they'v talk about not want to be a car manufacturer, but it' hard to take them at face valu there, becaus they'r look to obscur thi as much as possible. You want to talk a littl bit about what we got in term of commentari there?Sparks:Yeah, that wa one of the big takeaway when they were come out with thi Waymo announcement. There wa some specul that Alphabet could be work on it own Google-brand car. While they might not actual have thought of plan of manufactur it, as they do with their hardwar products, they often outsourc the manufactur and then slap that brand on, similar to the way Appledo with Foxconn, but, there wa some specul that they could tri to be work on some Google-brand car, and we have seen their car with no steer wheel, their ambiti vision of a total autonom drive experience. There ha been some specul in the past that they would be plan to bring a larger fleet of those to the market. But the CEO of Waymo, John Krafcik -- I think that' how you pronounc it?Lewis:I think it' pronounc anoth way, but I'm not sure. I'v onli seen it and writing, I have not heard it said. I understand how neither of us are total sure.Sparks:OK, that sound better, we'll go with that. We'll just call him John today. John, he emphas that they'r not tri to turn into a car business, but rather want to focu on the technolog behind the cars, and basically, Waymo' mission to make drive autonomous, to make it safer, and, as in their name, realli focu on the mobility. I think thi is a good move. Thi is someth that Alphabet ha succeed at in the past by realli focus on softwar and gather data -- because, essentially, that' the company' core mission, to organ data. So, by do this, I'm actual more bullish on the segment by see that they'r realli go to focu on their core compet with it. And mayb similar to the way Alphabet tri to add in Google-brand hardwar later on with Android,mayb they'll do a similar thing with car by tri to bring in Google-brand car later on after they'v realli develop and hone in on their expertis and the autonom area of the technology.Lewis:Yeah, the quot from John, as we'll refer to him, ""We'r in the busi of make better drivers. We'r a self-driv car company, not a car company."" I think, if you look back at some of the thing that have happen in the last month or so, you see that Appl seem to be take kind of a similar rout with their autonom drive ambitions.Sparks:Right. We see these big tech companies, and then you look at the giant automobil segments, where compani like Alphabet and Appl don't have ani signific revenue, and in theory, it look like thi awesom opportun for Alphabet and Appl to start make these cars. Mayb that' whi a lot of the specul receiv so much attention, think about a Google-brand or Apple-brand car is a realli power idea, it could open up the compani to huge new revenu opportunities. But, when you actual get down to think about it, especi in Alphabet' case, it would realli be out of their core compet to start make cars. Even Apple, by outsourc their manufactur and build Apple-brand hardwar products, along with their software, car is just a whole 'nother breed. It' a realli capital-intens business. By Alphabet do this, and now, like we'r go to talk about, Appl focus on the softwar part of the business, it realli de-risk these new segments, but on the other hand, may decreas some of the potenti upsid if thing do go well.Lewis:Yeah, you look at the margin profil for the car busi and the smartphon business, and they are dramat different. It would be veri tough to achiev high-30% margin in cars. For as much as I know about the industri business, I know that. So, you can understand whi these huge tech compani are instead choos to focu on someth that' super scalabl and can be easili brought into million of car without actual have to manufactur them themselves.Sparks:Right.Lewis:And if you had ani doubt about Apple' interest in make self-driv cars, I think Tim Cook ha been pretti coy in some public interview about not realli let in on a lot of details, be a littl cagey, the compani sent a letter to the Nation Highway Traffic Safeti Administr regard Feder Autom Vehicl Polici earlier thi month. And it made it pretti clear they have someth cook there. The NHTSA can grant exempt to certain complianc standard if that organ decid that it' import for research and investigations. Apple' letter wa essenti urg the administr to expedit the exempt request that are come in from some new entrants, so, some peopl that mayb haven't been quit as ambiti as the earli entrant into autonom driving. That, I think, say all you need to hear about their interest in thi space, and the fact that it' someth that they'r obvious put a decent number of resourc into.Sparks:Yeah, I think that Appl is definit work on a car, as far as we can tell. Recent report suggest that the compani ha hundr of employe work on it. The transition, initially, it wa refer to as Project Titan, and it initi transit away from build a car -- thi is all speculation, keep in mind -- to realli focus on the technology, similar to Alphabet. The rumor is, now, it' go to be deepli integr into iOS, and the compani is look for a 2017 deadlin of proof of concept of someth that can work. So, Alphabet and Apple, these are still realli specul things. But, at least with Alphabet, we'r start to see a direction, an actual company, and an effort to monet the business, which is encouraging.Lewis:And for both of those companies, these are thing that are exciting. They'r veri attractive, they'r fun to specul on becaus they are nascent tech. But they are not go to be meaning to the top line or bottom line for quit some time. That' someth to keep in mind there. Of course, flip over to the privat side of things, not a public company, but Uber also made headlin thi week, of course, not to be outdon by some of the larger tech names. After the compani had deploy some self-driv vehicl in Pittsburgh in Septemb earlier thi year, they now have deploy about five or so autonom Volvo XC90 SUV in San Francisco. The aim there wa to have them not onli be out on the roads, but out on the road pick up customers, right?Sparks:Right. They kind of jump the gun on thi one, and put them out on the California road without a permit, which California requir for auto manufactur test autonom vehicles. What Uber did wa kind of make an assumpt with wordplay. Appar the rule wa that manufactur test autonom vehicl that don't requir human driver to get a permit, and to make sure that someon is there, readi to grab the wheel and take over. That wordplay wa that the vehicl wa autonomous, that' when they would need a permit. So, Uber argued, ""Well, these car aren't technic autonomous, becaus we have driver there readi to take over when someth goe wrong."" Of course, in their blog post, they did say they'r deploy ""self-driving"" cars, they use that wording. So, it' realli interest to see them go thi rout with it. It caus a lot of debat as to whether thi is right. It brought Uber back to a problem they had earli and were scale back on, which wa be a rebel when it come to regulations. Kind of put them back in that spot right now.Lewis:Yeah, that certainli doesn't help their case in tri to improv their reputation. I know that' someth that ha plagu them for quit some time. It'll be interest to see how that play out with regul in California, and whether it' someth they push forward on. In prepar for the show, we talk about how there' kind of a huge differ between how a public compani and a privat compani might handl someth like this, just becaus the liabil on Alphabet or Apple' side, with do someth without express written consent from the regulatori body, could be devast to them as a busi and to shareholders. And, I'm sure there are a lot of control in place for peopl that have privat placement with Uber. But, you can afford to be a littl bit more brash when you don't have public investors, I guess.Sparks:Right. And it' worth note that, accord to Bloomberg, the California DMV is say it' go to tri to pursu legal action on Uber. I don't think it' clear yet that Uber ha stopped. But there wa an interest scenario when, on the first day of thi program, one of the Volvo with the self-driv hardwar ran a red light when a pedestrian wa tri to cross the sidewalk. Uber said in an updat that it wasn't actual in self-driv mode when thi happened. They emphasized, ""So, thi is whi we need to be push so hard for a self-driv futur to help with safety."" Kind of a funni instance.Lewis:Mayb more wordplay there, too, it seems. (laughs) And, last but not least, I know that you want to touch on Tesla, and how they are go about self-driv a littl bit differently, just becaus they are not, by nature, a platform company, they are a manufactur first, and that give them some advantag when it come to integr their solutions, and mayb on the data side, as well.Sparks:Yeah. So, you have compani like Tesla, GM, in some ways, who are tri to work on the self-driv software, but also on the manufacturing. You look at Uber, when they'r sole focus on the softwar for now, for self-driving, it doe present some challenges, as far as test these autonom vehicl and get them readi for the public road works, becaus a compani like Uber can't realli give it sensor away to manufacturers. They would actual have to sell those sensors. And that' where the challeng is. How are they go to get these sensor over to all these manufacturers, and how are they go to get all thi data about how these sensor are oper on the roads, unless they'r actual get the sensor into the cars? So, then you have compani like Tesla, who are alreadi deliv vehicl with the self-driv sensor in them, they could run these sensor in shadow mode while peopl are drive in their normal daili routes, even while they'r hold the wheel, and they could collect inform and realli start get the data, becaus they'r also a manufacturer. Of course, they'r still make money on their sensors, becaus they'r sell the car itself.Then, you have Gener Motors, similarly, they are a manufacturer, but they'r also working, at least in part, with Lyft. And they'v made some of their own acquisit on develop a self-driv software. So, they can sell their cars, make money on their cars, and have a revenu stream with a busi model alreadi as they'r put these sensor in vehicles, and start collect data. Of course, they are not to the point yet where they are alreadi deliv car with self-driv hardwar like Tesla is, but I imagin that they could do that in the futur as well, and run it in shadow mode. That' just an interest point.Lewis:Yeah. There are a lot of thing that are unclear about the self-driv car market. The one thing that is clear is that there are a bunch of differ compani with a lot of money at their dispos tri to crack that nut a coupl of differ ways.Sparks:Right, yeah. It' a realli uncertain space right now. I think that' the biggest takeaway from this. It' exciting, it' interesting, but these are all small portion of businesses. Even at a compani like Tesla, there are no car actual drive themselv on the road right now. All of these, investor should put it into perspective, I think.Lewis:Yeah.

3 Unbelievably Undervalued Dividend Stocks,12/18/2016,"TheS&P 500i current trade near an all-tim high, which is make it quit difficult to find compani that are trade on the cheap. However, if you'r will to turn over a lot of rocks, you'll find that there are still a hand of stock out there that are trade for dirt-cheap prices.Imag source: Getti Images.makeArticleAd();Brookfield Properti Partners(NYSE: BPY) ,Ford(NYSE: F) , andGamestop(NYSE: GME) are three such stocks, and better yet, they all offer up huge dividend yields. Let' take a closer look at all three to determin if they could be worth buying.A global real estat empireBrookfield Properti Partner make it money by buy real estat asset such as offic buildings, retail stores, and multifamili properties, and it then leas out space in those properti under long-term contracts. Thi busi model provid the compani with a steadi base of cash flow that manag use to pay out an ever-ris distribution.Imag source: Brookfield Properti Partners.Brookfield' asset are current worth $31 per unit, which is up about 3% over the year-ago period. That' a solid growth rate when you consid that the compani took a hit on currenc fluctuations, and it also paid out $1.12 in annual distributions. With share current trade under $22 per share, I think Brookfield Properti Partner is meaning undervalued.Thankfully, I'm not the onli one who agrees. Manag ha been buy back it unit hand over fist, retir more than 2.8 million unit in the last 15 month alone. With share trade at such a discount to their asset value, I think that' a great use of capital.An auto giantInvestor haven't been show larg automak like Ford ani love recently, and it' not hard to understand why. Auto sale have been on fire in the lucr North American market, which is caus trader to worri that sale and profitsar peaking. If true, that could suggest that sale and profit margin are current unsustain high, which mean futur profit growth could stagnate, or even declin in the year ahead.If that wasn't enough to worri about, there' also the veri possibl that autonom vehicl and ride-shar servic could put a dent in auto sale over the long term. Mix in the fact thatTesla Motorsha been rapidlytak market share, and it' not hard to understand whi trader are approach the company' stock with caution.Imag source: Getti Images.Al of those worri have weigh heavili on Ford' stock, which is whi the compani is current trade at less than six time trail earnings. When you combin that valu price tag with the company' rise dividend payments, Ford' dividend yield ha been abov 4.5%.Despit all the doom and gloom, Ford doe offer reason investor to be optimistic. The compani is invest heavili to mass produc a self-driv car for use in ride-hail and ride-shar by 2021, which Ford believ could driveincreas profitabilityin the year ahead. In the meantime, Ford stock is so cheap, investor could win by buy share today.A busi in transitionWith trail and forward P/E ratio below seven, it isn't much of a stretch to say that investor have written off video-gam retail GameStop as ""dead money."" It' not hard to understand the narr that surround the company, either. Comparable-stor sale aredeclining, which is pull down revenu and earn per share. With gamer continu to shift their attent away from physic product and toward digit offerings, it isn't hard to paint thi company' futur as bleak.Imag source: GameStop.However, GameStop' manag team is certainli awar of these industri dynamics, and they'r invest accordingly. GameStop is beef up it digit and mobil offer and bundl them with physic game purchases. That help drive a 54% jump in it tech brand sale divis last quarter. The compani is also make a big push into the collect space through it Think Geek brand, where revenu is grow rapidly. Better still, these new area are higher margin than it legaci game business, so gross margin are actual on the rise.Of course, it will still be some time befor the company' growth initi will fulli offset the revenu declin from it physic game business, which is whi the market isn't give GameStop ani credit. However, analyst do believ these move will pay off in the long term as current estim call for EPSgrowthof more than 7% over the next five years. That' a strong growth rate for such an absurdli cheap stock. Add in a dividend yield of 5.8%, and it' possibl long-term investor could do well by buy share today.10 stock we like better than AppleWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

It’s Energy Storage's Time to Shine,12/18/2016,"Power storag ha been a major topic of discuss within energi industri circles, particularli in connect with renew energy, as technolog advanc appear pois to bring with them a new level of innovation. Afford storag would allow for more renew power sourc on the grid, creat a path for custom to leav the grid, and even allow for new innov around dynam load in energy.Th inconveni truth is that until recently, energi storag didn't have ani financi justification. Theideaof valu wa there, but there wa no actual valu to create. Rooftop solar power system creat energi and can offset demand from other sources. The best energi storag system can do is move demand from one hour of the day to another, but do that wa so expensive, it didn't make financi sense.What' chang recent is that util are start to put rate structur in place that will make energi storag more econom viable. Ironically, their move -- design to reduc the appeal of solar -- are provid the impetu for innov in the energi storag industry.makeArticleAd();Imag source: Getti Images.Wher storag is hit the grid todayTh initi use of energi storag system have been primarili in commerci build and util applications. A commerci build can use storag to reduc demand charg -- fee base on the peak consumpt in a build everi month. And util are run pilot program and even use store power to patch hole in the grid, as Southern California Edison did earlier thi year when it couldn't provid enough peak power to custom after the Aliso Canyon natur ga leak.Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) swoop in and quickli built an 80 MWh energi storag system to fill the gap.Thes are import applications, but they'r also just the tip of the iceberg. As cost fall and technolog improves, we'll see energi storag play a bigger role across the country.GTM Research estim that 260 MW of energi storag will be built in the U.S. in 2016, but that figur will jump to 478 MW in 2017 and 2,045 MW by 2021.Imag source:GTM Research.Develop are just start to scratch the surfac of energi storage' potential.What the futur of storag look likeTh econom of energi storag start to make sens as the price of batteri come down. And that' when we'll see greater adoption.In residenti solar, custom will be abl to use storag system to consum more of the energi gener directli from their rooftop systems, rather than sell it back to utilities. Thi wa the intent of Tesla' Powerwall, and withSan Diego Ga & ElectricandPacif Ga & Electric-- two of the largest util in California -- transit from tradit net meter to the time of use rate in Net Meter 2.0, there will be more valu to be extract from good storag systems.Sunrun(NASDAQ: RUN) andSunPower(NASDAQ: SPWR) are also bring their own storag solut to homeowners, so look for the adopt of residenti energi storag to grow tremend in 2017.Commerci energi storag will continu to be driven by demand-charg reductions, but we could see more energi storag system instal for self-consumpt as well.Th segment to watch in 2017 is realli util scale storage. We will like see larg batteri distribut throughout the grid, capabl of reliev pressur on the grid locally. I also expect energi storag will begin be includ in renew energi bid in the future. The larg concentr of solar in California ha alreadi led to a power consumpt pattern that ha been dubbedth duck curve: Demand on the grid drop off dure day, follow by a larg increas as the sun goe down (take solar out of the equation) and most peopl get home from work. Energi storag system built in conjunct with renew energi plant can help make the duck curv less dramat for the grid.Energi storag may start turn a new leafTh energi storag industri is in a similar posit to where solar wa in 2010. The econom are start to justifi it for some applications, and cost are rapidli come down, open new opportun in the market. That in turn will lead to new innov and product offerings. In short, 2017 may final be energi storage' time to shine.10 stock we like better than Tesla MotorsWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Microsoft: Trump's Trade War Could End Badly,12/18/2016,"ByBlu Harbinger:Despit bygones, tech leader and presid elect Trump struck a friendli chord at thi past Wednesday' Tech Summit held at the Trump Tower in New York. However, glean potenti polici from the topic discuss (and Trump' campaign rhetoric) could spell troubl for sever of the Tech Summit attendees, Microsoft (MSFT) in particular.Thi articl provid a brief review of Microsoft' evolv business, sever valuat metric worth considering, and an overview of the potenti impact (posit and negative) of new polici that may come out of the Trump Administr such as those that would artifici creat more US tech jobs, lower corpor tax rates, pressur interest rate higher, allow oversea cash repatriation, and util punit tariff with intern trade partners.OverviewmakeArticleAd();Microsoft' busi consist of three segments: Product and Busi Process (consist of Offic and Dynamics), Intellig Cloud (consist of public, privat and hybrid server product and cloud services, includ Azure), and More Person Comput (consist of Windows, devices, gaming, search advertising, Bing and eventu LinkedIn). And for reference, the follow chart show the revenu and oper margin breakdown and growth trajectori of each segment.(click to enlarge)(click to enlarge)(click to enlarge)(source: MSFTearn slides)Mor Person Comput is the biggest in term of revenues, but ha lower margin and is therefor the laggard in term of oper income. And with regard to revenu growth, More Person Comput (-1%) is also the laggard versu the other segment (+8% and +10%) on a year-over-year basi as shown in the follow table.(click to enlarge)(source: MSFTearn slides)With regard to Cloud, Microsoft seem to be the number two player (behind Amazon Web Services) in an extrem competit space. Notwithstand ani mistakes, Cloud should provid Microsoft continu growth. Additionally, Microsoft' Product and Busi Process Applic provid some strong advantag and barrier to entri versu peers, as doe the Window oper system.For more perspective, the follow graph show how Microsoft' Window for PC is becom a smaller part of Microsoft' revenue, and server product and tool are accelerating.And from a bottom line standpoint, Microsoft' net incom remain healthi as revenu remain strong, as shown in the follow chart.(click to enlarge)Additionally, Microsoft ha provid a posit outlook wherebi revenu in two of it three segment is expect to grow (Product and Busi Process plu Intellig Cloud, but not More Person Computing).(click to enlarge)Valu MetricsFrom a price-to-earn standpoint, Microsoft remain reason price as shown in the follow chart (take the tech bubbl era with a grain of salt).(click to enlarge)Additionally, a basic discount free cash flow model suggest Microsoft ha some price appreci potential. Specifically, if we discount Microsoft' 2016Free Cash Flowof $25 billion, by it 11.85% weight averagecostof capit and assum a 9.1% 5-year annual growth rate (thi is the averag estim of the 8 professionalanalystssurvey on Yahoo Finance), and a conserv 3-5% growth rate thereafter, then Microsoft is worth $465.0B to $580.4B after adjust for outstand long-term debt (-$60.2B) and cash and short-term invest (+$136.9B). On a per share basis, thi amount to a valuat between $59.76 and $74.61, which give Microsoft current share price roughli 8% upsid versu the midpoint of the range.Worth noting, Microsoft pay a healthi dividend. The dividend yield current sit at around 2.4% (a shown in the follow chart) which is abov averag for Microsoft and abov averag for an S&P 500 company, particularli one in the technolog sector.(click to enlarge)A higher than averag dividend yield from a blue chip compani like Microsoft can be a signal from manag that they believ their stock price should be higher (which would mathemat bring the dividend yield closer to the histor norm, ceteri paribus). Worth noting, Microsoft' dividend payment are well cover as shown in the follow chart.(click to enlarge)In essence, Microsoft is a stabl compani with an abov averag dividend and the potenti for more growth and share price appreciation.New Administr PoliciesIt is worth consid the potenti polici chang (and their impact on Microsoft) that might come out of the Trump Administr follow thi past week' ""Tech Summit"" (attend by Alphabet (GOOGL) CEO Larri Page, Tesla (TSLA) and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, Appl (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook, Facebook (FB) COO Sheryl Sandberg, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, Cisco (CSCO) CEO Chuck Robbins, IBM (IBM) CEO Ginni Rometty, Intel (INTC) CEO Brian Krzanich, Oracl (ORCL) CEO Safra Catz, and Amazon (AMZN) CEO Jeff Bezos, to name a few).Specifically, we consid polici that may artifici creat more US tech jobs, lower corpor tax rates, pressur interest rate higher, allow oversea cash repatriation, and util punit tariffs.1. More US JobsFor starters, one of Trump' biggest theme is US job creation. However, the type of job he' talk about (middl class manufactur jobs) aren't go to help Microsoft, and hi view on highli skill intern worker may actual harm Microsoft significantly. For example, Trump ha been critic of H1B visas, claim they take job away from Americans. In our view, H1B job help Microsoft attract the talent it need to remain successful. Forexample…""Microsoft is an outspoken oppon of the cap on H1B visas, which allow compani in the U.S. to employ certain foreign workers. Bill Gate claim the cap on H1B visa make it difficult to hire employe for the company, state ""I'd certainli get rid of the H1B cap."" Critic of H1B visa argu that relax the limit would result in increas unemploy for U.S. citizen due to H1B worker work for lower salaries.""Additionally, Trump may attempt to forc more manufactur job into the US, rather than allow US compani to trade more freeli with intern partner (for example, Trump want to see Apple' iPhon manufactur in the US, despit daunt econom headwinds). Gener speaking, intern trade can increas product and effici by allow each partner to focu on what they'r best at, and then allow trade so each partner can obtain what it needs. Polici restrict intern trade could particularli impact Microsoft consid ""a of June 30, 2016, Microsoft employ approxim 114,000 peopl on a full-tim basis, 63,000 in the U.S. and 51,000 internationally; and also accord to Microsoft ""Our intern oper provid a signific portion of our total revenue…"") (2016 Microsoft Annual Report). Overall, Trump may be abl to creat some new US job with hi pro-growth agenda, but if he restrict free trade and H1B visa he could significantli hurt Microsoft in particular.2. Lower Corpor Tax RatesWith regard to lower corpor tax rate (anoth one of Trump' consist themes), thi is a no-brain (in a good way) for US business, but it may help Microsoft less than some of it peer given it alreadi rel low effect tax rate as shown in the follow chart.(click to enlarge)Th theori is that by lower tax on corporations, it will make them more competit internationally. It will also, in theory, prevent compani from reloc to other countri with lower tax rate and take away US job when they relocate. However, as the abov chart shows, Microsoft alreadi ha a lower effect tax rate than mani of it peers. Lower corpor tax rate could help Microsoft on the margin, but competit less so than it peers. Arguably, Trump could spur the overal economi by lower tax rate across all market sector which would eventu trickl down to Microsoft, but in the immedi term a lower corpor tax polici is like to help Microsoft less than other companies.3. Rais Interest RatesTh Fed set interest rates, not the President, but Trump' aggress growth agenda could speed up the economi result in the Fed act sooner to rais rate faster and thi could actual help Microsoft given it larg cash balanc that current earn veri low interest (i.e. higher interest rate mean Microsoft could earn a higher rate of return on it cash). And granted, much of the $137 billion in cash on Microsoft' balanc sheet is overseas, but in theori the US can lead interest rate around the world higher if it' success abl to acceler growth.4. Repatri Non-U CashA the follow chart shows, Microsoft ha a veri larg amount of foreign cash. And given the current high tax rate to repatri thi cash, compani aren't do it.If the Trump Administr were to orchestr a tax deal wherebi compani could pay less tax, then they'd like be will to bring that cash back to the US. Thi would be a ""win-win"" in the sens that the lower tax rate would allow compani to bring the cash back to the US and creat more US growth and US profits, while still allow the govern to collect some revenu from the lower taxat rate on the repatriation. Thi is a potenti Trump polici that actual make sens and could benefit Microsoft.5. Intern TradeDonald Trump ha express a comb attitud toward intern trade partners.

For example, dure the earli 2000s, China openli allow pirat copi of Microsoft Window to be sold in most big citi for onli around $1 (clearli thi wa not good for Microsoft). And it would be easi for China to allow similar case go forward if Trump take ani aggress actions. As anoth example, China is alreadi flood US market with too much steel and aluminum which is keep price artifici low and hurt US producers. As yet anoth example, China ha a reput for manipul it currenc therebi make it export veri inexpensive.If Trump start a trade war with China (he did threaten a 45% tariff dure hi campaign), or ani other countri for that matter, it could end badli for all US companies, especi those with signific non-U business, such as Microsoft (e.g. Microsoft ha 51,000 intern employees, and intern oper provid a signific portion of Microsoft' total revenue).ConclusionTh could end badli for a lot of tech companies, especi Microsoft, if the new administr follow through on some of it aggress polici ideas, particularli with regard to intern trade.

1 Major Problem With General Motors' New All-Electric Bolt,12/16/2016,"Appleco-found Steve Wozniak ha long been known as an earli adopt will to give new product a shot earli in their lifecycles. Unsurprisingly, he ha been a vocal owner of aTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) Model S -- perhap the geekiest car on the planet. And in September, Wozniak said onFacebookh would be switch toGener Motors'(NYSE: GM) new all-electr Chevrolet Bolt when it came out.Chevrolet Bolt. Imag source: Gener Motors.makeArticleAd();Gener Motor wa certainli happi about Woz' decision. In a Novemb press confer at the LA Auto Show about the Bolt, the compani highlight Wozniak' decis to switch to a Bolt, show a slide saying, ""Appl co-found ditch Tesla."" Woz' decis to buy the Bolt signal just how compel the Bolt was, even to earli adopters.But now that the Bolt is here, Wozniak ha chang hi mind, instead buy an addit Model S.What happened? Woz is concern about the feasibl of the vehicl on road trips, he said on Facebook thi week.Whil Wozniak' stori repres the opinion of onli one person, it highlight a major problem with the new Bolt: It maximum charg rate is too slow.Woz bolt on the Bolt... for now""I'm concern about how it would work on our favor road trips,"" Wozniak said about the Bolt on Facebook. ""So far, Tesla' the onli game in town for that.""Wozniak wa like refer to how much longer it will take to charg a Bolt. The 50-kilowatt charg the Bolt can handl is well below the 20 kW of power that a Model S can handle. To be fair, Wozniak is still consid the Bolt, he said on Facebook. ""It had a lot of thing nicer about it than the Tesla,"" he noted. But Gener Motor might have to improv the Bolt' charg speed first.Tesla Supercharg span major highway in the U.S. Western Europe, and China. Imag source: The Motley Fool.Th Bolt' websit detail the Bolt' charg rate: ""Bolt EV offer DC Fast Charg capability, which provid up to 90 mile of rang in about 30 minut of charg time."" Go further, Gener Motor boldli assert that, ""Bi the time you finish a cup of coffee, you'll be power up and so will your Bolt EV."" But thi descript doesn't truli captur what the charg experi will be like for Bolt owners.With over 200 mile of range, Bolt owner will like charg at home for their daili driving. So the most like situat in which Bolt owner would need to stop to charg would be when they are travel long distances. And on road trips, Bolt owner will like want to charg more than 90 miles, so they should probabl plan for a long dinner instead of a coffe -- a full charg will take about two hours.Wil thi impact demand?It' possibl Wozniak would have never consid the Bolt in the first place if he had been awar of how slowli the Bolt would charge. As Electrekpoint out, GM hadn't actual confirm the Bolt' maximum charg rate at the time. Given that the Bolt use a 60 kilowatt-hour batteri -- a batteri capac Tesla ha use in it vehicl befor -- buyer would assum the Bolt could handl a charg rate as power as a Model S can. But accord to Gener Motors' website, the Bolt charg ismuchslow than a Tesla vehicle. For comparison, a Model S' 120 kW charg can deliv about 170 mile of rang in around 30 minutes.Chevrolet Bolt. Imag source: Gener Motors.Sure, the Bolt' $37,500 price tag is much lower than the Model S' $68,000 start price, help justifi it much slower charg rate. But there' no reason Tesla' $35,000 Model 3, which the electric-car maker plan to begin deliv by the end of next year, won't be abl to match the Model S' charg rate.A Bolt custom recogn thi flaw with Gener Motors' newest technology, Woz might not be the onli Chevrolet custom bolting.10 stock we like better than Gener MotorsWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The trend is like to continu into 2017, befor drop to the 16 million range.However, polit event and market instabl could lead to an earli decline.

You Got It Wrong. Alphabet Inc (GOOG) Leads the Self-Driving Space.,12/16/2016,"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlac - Stock Market News, Stock Advic & Trade TipsGoogle' driverless car project ha final graduat fromAlphabet Inc's(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) research lab to becom a stand-alon compani calledWaymo. But while Googl expect Waymo to becom a revenu sourc soon, it' been attack for seemingli fall behind in the self-driv car race.Source:Travi Wise via FlickrWaymo CEO John Krafcik, who by the way is an auto-industri veteran, made it clear that Waymo isn't a car company.makeArticleAd();H said Alphabet' self-driv car busi is into make better drivers. TheWal Street Journalparaphras Krafcik assaying, ""[Krafcik] saw opportun in ride sharing, transport logist and trucking, as well as licens technolog to other auto makers.""Ther were no definit statement on how the compani intend to gener revenue, either. What is clear is that GOOGL is unlik to make it own self-driv car and investor should appreci Alphabet' approach. Here' why.Googl Lead the Self-Driv Car RaceIn recent months, Google' beencritic for slack offin the self-driv car race. However, it self-driv car have not log over 2 million mile over the past eight year for nothing.Th 10 Best Stock to Buy for 2017OnlyTesla Motor Inc's(NASDAQ:TSLA) Autopilot program haslog more hours(100 million mile as of May 2016.) That' becaus there are around 70,000 autopilot-en Tesla car on the road.Crit have point to move by tradit automak likeGener Motor Company's(NYSE:GM) acquisit ofCruis Automation, and Tesla' Autopilot, among others, as proof that GOOGL is now in the back seat. Areportfrom earlier thi year on howToyota Motor Corp (ADR)(NYSE:TM) had the highest number of patent relat to self-driv car also help them buttress their points.Aft all, Toyota had over a thousand patent as of when the report wa published, while GOOGL onli had a few hundr patents. However, what' not be said is that the patent Alphabet hold are mostli relat to Vehicle-to-Vehicl (V2V) and Vehicle-Infrastructur (V2I) technologies.For instance, GOOGL receiv apatentthat could prevent autonom car collis victim from be drag under the car earlier thi year.Consid that Googl wa a pioneer and it doesn't have the most patents, it seem the compani ha alway known the rout it would take, which wouldn't be make cars. Obviously, other automak will need these V2V and V2I technolog to make self-driv car work well with the surrounding.Th idea goes, ""Allow them to make the self-driv cars, they'll pay us to help connect their car to the surrounding."" Sidewalk and Nest are like a big part of Waymo becaus of what they stand for.GOOGL Stock Is Well-PositionedAlphabet' decis not to make it own car is a good one, and GOOGL stock holder should applaud it. Tradit auto-manufactur is alreadi highli capit intensive. A futurist auto manufactur busi is probabl go to be even more capit intensive. The huge capit outlay that build it own car will requir might not be worth it, as thi is an unproven market.Moreover, as Tesla is showing, it' not easi to break even in the car-mak business. So make it own car wouldn't have been the best rout to profitability. However, the opportun that Krafcik outlin are rel less capit intensive. The translat is that it will be much easier for GOOGL to own a profit self-driv busi go thi route.Stay Far, Far Away From Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock in 2017Look at it from the perspect of risk-taking, I believ Alphabet know what it is doing. As state above, thi market is unproven. Therefore, by licens it technologies, go into car sharing, etc., GOOGL stock is shield from the worst-cas scenario of self-driv car failing.But even if self-driv car fail, it technolog can still be monet becaus the auto industri will keep evolv technologically. For investor look to take a rel safe bet on self-driv cars, GOOGL stock present one of your best options.A of thi writing, Craig Adeyanju did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlace4 BlackRock ETF to Buy for Steadi Retir IncomeTh 7 Best Monthli Dividend Stock for 2017The postYou Got It Wrong.

The answer to whetherFord Motor Company(NYSE:F) is a good valu is … well, maybe.Source:Jen Mayer via Flickr (Modified)I know that' not the answer you want to hear. But there are a lot of factor to take into consider when evalu Ford stock, whether it be individu or rel to it peers. So it just won't be a simpl answer.makeArticleAd();In my opinion,Gener Motor Company(NYSE:GM) stock is thebettervaluewhen head-to-head with Ford. Of course, up againstTesla Motor Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA), F stock suddenli becom extrem cheap at 0.33 time sale versu 5.75 time for Elon Musk' wonder business.And that' whi ultimately, despit mani metric to determin it, valu is subjective, not objective.

If it doe well on these questions, the notion of good valu take care of itself.I it grow in each of these markets, and if so, by how much?Who is grow faster and why?Ford - Unit Sale by marketMarketNovemb 2016 SalesGrowth2016 YTD SalesGrowthEurop 78,7922.1%967,675 3.6% China 124,11317.0%1.1M 10.7% U.S. 197,5745.2%2.4M 0.04%So, Ford is grow sale in each of these markets, although it year-to-d number in the U.S. leav a lot to be desired.

However, each of the car compani ha a particular way of reporting, or not reporting, a particular month' unit sale and those year-to-date.I challeng you to come up with a figur forFiat Chrysler Automobil NV(NYSE:FCAU) in China. It annual report say it sold139,000vehicl in the countri for the entir 2015, down 18.7% from 2014. What it ha done in 2016, I realli couldn't say.That' realli too bad, becaus FCAU is take Ford and GM to the mat when it come to their competit in Europe. And they'r not do horribl in the U.S. where they'v alway been a distant third in the Motor City.At a price-to-sal ratio of 0.1 and Sergio Marchionn at the helm, I do like FCAU as a potenti deep valu play.If you look at the China and U.S. market as one, Ford and GM are basic do about the same in term of growth with Ford win in China and GM in the U.S.I Ford Stock Good Value?A I said earlier, if I had to pick one of the two on a rel valu basis, I'd go with GM. However, I'd say Ford is good valu rel to it own histor valuat metrics.Sel Your Fitbit Inc (FIT) Stock at a Decent Price ... While You CanTh problem for me is that I'm skeptic of all car compani as investments. They requir way too much capit for the profit they gener and the risk they present.In the case of Ford, it' commit to make lot of small car inMexico- it want to move Ford Focu product from Michigan - becaus consum don't like to pay too much for smaller cars. If Trump decid to carri out hi hate-on for Mexico, Ford' go to get caught in the tariff crossfire.But hey, if you want to own stock in a car company, you could do wors than Ford.A of thi writing, Will Ashworth did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlaceBest Stock for 2017: Citigroup Inc (C) Stock Is UndervaluedTh 10 Best Mutual Fund to Buy for 2017The 7 Best Dividend Stock to Buy for 2017The postI Ford Motor Compani (F) Stock a Good Value?appear first onInvestorPlace."

2 Risks Qualcomm Will Face After Acquiring NXP Semiconductors,12/16/2016,"Qualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM) seem to have open the door to automot rich with it pend acquisit ofNXP Semiconductors(NASDAQ: NXPI) . NXPcurrent holds14.5% share in the automot semiconductor market, which is expect to be worth $36 billion by 2019, and Qualcomm is buy the lead in thi fast-grow market with it pend $47 billion purchas of NXP.However, Qualcomm' NXP acquisit doe not ensur that the former will becom the domin player in the automot semiconductor business, as it will face a stiff challeng fromInfineon Technologies(NASDAQOTH: IFNNY) . Additionally, Qualcomm might face integr and margin challeng onc the merger is complete.makeArticleAd();Whi Infineon could pose a strong challengeInfineon Technolog is the second-largest supplier of chip to the automot industri with an estim market share of 10.4% to NXP' 14.5%. Thi mean that Infineon doe not lag NXP by a huge margin. What' more, in 2015, Infineon led NXP in two of the three subseg in the automot semiconductor market.Imag source: Infineon Technologies.Infineon led NXP in the market for power and sensor chip in the automot industri last year. These two market were worth $11.3 billion. In comparison, NXP led Infineon by a huge margin in the microcontrol segment, which wa alon worth $6.5 billion.In the long run, Infineon can close the gap on NXP as it is the lead supplier of drivetrain solut to electr vehicles. Infineon suppli it drivetrain solut to seven of the top 10 electr vehicl in term of sale last year. It count the like ofTesla Motors,BMW, Chevrolet,Volkswagen, and BYD Tang as it customers. Thi put Infineon in a strong posit in thi market as it project that sale of electr vehicl will grow from just 400,000 unit in 2015 to 10 million unit in 2025.Along with pend growth in the number of electr vehicl -- which account for less than 1% of market share in 2015 -- the amount of semiconductor content is also expect to grow. Infineon forecast that the semiconductor bill of materi in an EV will be as much as $705 per vehicl by 2025. In comparison, the chip content in each vehicl last year wa $332, accord to NXP.EV will carri higher chip content as compar to internal-combustion-engine-bas vehicl becauseth electr drivetrain use in EV contain a lot of electron for power switching. The electron system in a hybrid drivetrain rout power from the batteri to the motor through an inverter, while no such electron system are need in an internal-combust engine.Accord to McKinsey, the averag hybrid drivetrain contain 10 time the semiconductor content as compar to an internal-combust drivetrain. As a result, the demand for insulated-g bipolar transistors, or IGBTs, will continu increas as they play an import role in EV power systems.Infineon enjoy a strong posit in the IGBT market with a market share of 27.6%. In 2015, the IGBT market wa worth $3.94 billion, accord to Infineon, and some estim put it at $6 billion in revenu by 2018.So, Infineon could bridg the market share gap over NXP in the long run on the back of EV growth.Integr challengesQualcomm' acquisit of NXP will have a neg margin impact on the former. Thi is becaus Qualcomm' gross margin profil is higher than that of NXP. For example, in the recent report third quarter, NXP post a non-GAAP gross margin of 50.5%. In comparison, Qualcomm' gross profit margin in the third quarter stood at 58% .Thus, as Qualcomm begin to integr NXP after the merger is complet in 2017, the gross margin might start deteriorating. The higher gross margin profil of Qualcomm is a result of it fabless manufactur model as it outsourc it chip manufactur to foundri such asSamsung.On the other hand, NXP ha a foundry-bas busi model. It ha 14 chip manufactur facilities, along with seven packag and test facilities. However, these facil can't manufactur chip for Qualcomm as they are ""outdated,"" accord toMarket Realist. Thi reduc one potenti synergi from the acquisition.Despit thi hiccup, the NXP acquisit is expect to deliv $500 million in annual cost synergi for Qualcomm within two year after the closur of the transaction. However, 65% of the save will be on the oper expens side as Qualcomm will be abl to use NXP' exist relationship to sell it automot and Internet of Thing products.Qualcomm will also reduc it cost of good sold as the combin compani can negoti for lower raw materi price from suppliers. The reduct in the cost of good sold will account for 35% of the cost-sav synergi from the acquisition. The reason the cost of good sold synergi will be significantli lower than the oper expens reduct is becaus Qualcomm will not make much gain on the manufactur side of the busi due to the differ in the foundri business.Also, given the legaci natur of the foundries, it is like that NXP won't be get Qualcomm' money to upgrad them. Thi is becaus Qualcomm ha a differ busi model of outsourc it manufacturing, and invest in NXP' foundri would lead to an increas in costs.Although NXP will definit add anoth dimens to Qualcomm' business, we'v seen that it will also have a neg gross margin impact and pose integr issues. Additionally, the threat from Infineon cannot be ignored.So even though Qualcomm is make a smart move by acquir NXP Semiconductors, it is not guarante a smooth journey toward automot riches.10 stock we like better than QualcommWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Why Electric-Car Fans Should Watch Lucid Motors Closely,12/15/2016,"Electric-car start-up Lucid Motor unveil it first product in a media event in California on Wednesday. Lucid' Air is a sleek high-perform sedan that will have specif and price calibr to compet directli withTesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) .Thi is significant, and investor interest in electr and self-driv car should sit up and take note. The Lucid Air is no flight of design fancy. It' a seriou product, and Lucid is a seriou compani that stand an excel chanc of succeeding. Read on.makeArticleAd();Th Lucid Air is an electr luxuri sport sedan that promis long range, thrill performance, and advanc self-driv capabilities. Imag source: Lucid Motors.About the carTh Lucid Air is a big luxuri sedan that promis to combin extrem high perform with a roomy, comfortable, and quiet interior equip with a lot of advanc technology.Lik the top Tesla models, the Lucid Air should be veri fast, at least in a straight line. It might be even faster: Lucid claim ""best-in-class energi density"" for the Air' 100 kilowatt-hour batteri pack, which it say will give the Air ""in excess"" of 300 mile of range.Onc the Air is in production, a 130 kWh batteri pack will be avail as an option upgrade. That will offer ""up to"" 400 mile of rang and ""up to"" 1,000 horsepower. Both figur are a step ahead of what Tesla' current top-perform model can deliv right now.Imag source: Lucid Motors.Lucid' batteri pack will use a new lithium-ion batteri cell develop by the Samsung SDI unit ofSamsung Electronics(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) that promis ""breakthrough batteri life,"" accord to Lucid' chief technolog officer, Peter Rawlinson.Th Air' motor and transmiss unit wa develop entir in-house, Lucid said. It claim that it' ""smaller, more effici and more power-dens than competitors, while potenti more reliable."" (The word ""potentially"" is do a lot of work in that sentence. But as we'll see, Lucid' engin are not new to the car business.)Inside, Lucid promis ""execut seating"" with cushy, reclin rear seat that offer comfort and legroom compar to first-class airlin seats. A 29-speaker audio system will provid activ nois cancel to ensur that it' a quiet space.A you'd expect from a Silicon Valley automaker, self-driv technolog will be built in. Lucid will aim to have the Air equip with ""Level 4"" self-driv capabl at launch, pend approv by U.S. regulators. ""Level 4"" system can take full control of the vehicl under most (but not all) conditions, with littl to no involv from the human driver.Th Lucid Air' back seat is scale for adult comfort. Imag source: Lucid Motors.Lucid hasn't final price for the Air. But it said that a fulli load ""launch edition"" will be price around $160,000, with standard version start around $85,000. Lucid hope to get the start price down to around $65,000 in time.If all goe accord to plan, product of the Air will begin in late 2018. But some big thing have to happen in order for that plan to pan out.I thi vaporware, or is it for real?It' for real. Thi is not vaporware. It could turn out to be a big deal. But there are some caveat that come with that statement.For starters, Lucid is a real company, found in 2007. It ha about 330 employees, mani with past experi at Tesla or at larg global automakers. It chief designer, Derek Jenkins, wa formerli the director of design atMazdaNorth America. And Peter Rawlinson, the chief technolog officer, came to Lucid with one of the greatest electric-car resum credenti possible: He wa chief engin on the Tesla Model S.In some ways, the Lucid Air can be thought of as the Model S 2.0. It' averyserious, advanc design that read in mani way as a redesign Model S inform by experience. And it' clearli veri close to production-ready. It' not a show car.Th shape of the Air' roof allow plenti of rear-seat headroom. Imag source: Lucid Motors.But that' where the caveat come in: Right now, Lucid doesn't have a factori in which to build the Air or anyth else.It ha a site for a factory, in Casa Grande, Arizona, select for it proxim to key auto-industri supplier in Mexico. It ha a packag of subsidi promis by the Arizona state government, and a detail plan to start construct the $700 million facil in the second quarter of 2017.But it will need to rais money to make the factori a fulli function operation. Lucid ha said that futur fundrais round are planned, but it hasn't yet given specifics.So should we take Lucid Motor seriously?I think we should. Lucid seem to be posit itself as a sober-mind (""lucid"") altern to Tesla, in part by make a point of be entir focus on electr automobiles. It doesn't have a whiz-bang CEO like Elon Musk -- but Lucid (which employ a lot of Tesla veterans, remember) might argu that Musk' outsiz public imag and futurist vision take attent away from Tesla' product in the here and now.If anything, Lucid seem quietli determin to learn from (and not repeat) Tesla' missteps. It won't rush the Air into product nor let itself get distract by far-futur visions. That ""lucid"" attitude, the car itself, and the seriou cash alreadi invest in the compani make it worth close attent as it plan unfolds.10 stock we like better than AppleWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

3 Growth Stocks You Should Avoid in 2017,12/15/2016,"Imag source: Getti Images.There' no sugar-co it: Growth stock have been the shine star over valu stock sinc the Great Recess ended. Although aBank of America/Merril Lynch studi found that valu stock have outperform growth stock over the past 90 year with an averag annual gain of 17% versu 12.6%, the low-interest-r environ over the past eight year ha allow growth stock access to cheap and bounti capit to rapidli grow their business.But just becaus low interest rate favor growth stocks, it doesn't mean you can throw a dart and land a winner. Some growth stock are better off avoid in 2017. Here are three such growth stock that I'd suggest keep you distanc from next year.makeArticleAd();Tesla MotorsOn high-profil growth stock that I'd strongli suggest investor leav park on the sidelin in 2017 is electr vehicl manufacturerTesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) .Thi isn't to say Tesla isn't without it positives. Tesla obliter Wall Street' earn estim in it third-quart report, it wound up pay off about $600 million in debt, and it Model S sedan continu to gain market share. Perhap most importantly, Tesla' product level were a record of 25,185 vehicles, a 92% year-over-year increas and a 37% improv from the sequenti second quarter. Yet, in spite of an expect quadrupl in sale between 2015 and 2019, I'd advoc keep your distanc from Tesla becaus of three major risks.Tesla Model S. Imag source: Tesla Motors.Th first risk involv increas competition. Just a few year ago, Tesla' Model S wa the clear leader in mileag rang and luxury. However, other automak have made a commit to bring more effici EV to market. We'r see improv mileag rang between charges, as well as more power and luxuri withBMW, Porsche, and Mercedes-Benz offer new concept that could reach the market befor the end of the decade. While Tesla' market share domin is like to continu in the near term, it could begin to be chip away beyond 2017.Secondly, I'd be concern about Tesla' ramp-up in spend which is like to keep it as a cash-flow neg compani for year to come. No one said build a Gigafactori wa go to cheap, or that expand it annual product from 100,000 vehicl to 500,000 vehicl wa go to go off without a hitch. But Tesla ha also rack up more than $3 billion in debt, even after pay off $600 million. It debt-to-equ of 118% further confirm the weight on the company' shoulders.Lastly, the valuat remain someth out of a horror film. Tesla command a $34 billion market cap despit onli produc about 100,000 vehicl a year and lose money. Conversely, a compani likeGener Motors(NYSE: GM) produc 9.8 million vehicl in 2015 and made an adjust profit of more than $5 per share. Personally, Tesla look like a no-brain growth stock to avoid in 2017.BioMarin PharmaceuticalAnoth growth stock that I don't believ ha what it take to excel in 2017 is rare-diseas drug developerBioMarin Pharmaceutical(NASDAQ: BMRN) .On the surface, BioMarin ha a lot to like for longer-term investors. It focu on rare-diseas drug mean it'll face minim competit and that it'll probabl have excel price power if it therapi are approv by the Food and Drug Administration. BioMarin alreadi ha five rare-diseas drug approv by at least one major regulatori agenc around the world, and all of it therapi focu on ultra-rar diseases. Between 2015 and 2019, Wall Street is forecast that BioMarin' sale will essenti doubl from a report $890 million to approxim $1.8 billion.Imag source: Getti Images.However, there are also two drawback to BioMarin. To begin with, incom presid Donald Trump in hi latest interview withTimesuggest that he would lower drug price in the Unit States, which is a point he previous state on the campaign trail. Trump' onli polici mention relat to drug prices, thu far, wa outlin in hi seven-point healthcar reform. Within hi proposal, Trump opin that consum should be abl to look oversea for their medicines, sinc similar drug in oversea market are typic price lower than the U.S. It' unclear if Trump' call for lower drug price will have ani traction in Congress, but rare diseas drugmak like BioMarin that have drug exceed the $300,000 annual cost barrier are clearli on Trump' radar.An even more immedi issu could be BioMarin' ongo losses. To some extent the company' steep full-year loss can be forgiven sinc it' reinvest back into it pipeline. Then again, wait until 2019 to see a full-year profit doesn't seem worthwhil for a compani with a $14 billion market cap when you can go out and open a posit in a number of rare-diseas drugmak that are alreadi health profitable, such asAlexion PharmaceuticalsorShire.Ther appear to be far better option in biotech in 2017 than BioMarin Pharmaceutical.FitbitFinally, investor would probabl be wise to step away from fashion growth storyFitbit(NYSE: FIT) as we head into 2017.Like the growth stock above, Fitbit doe have posit that can be taken away. For example, Fitbit announc in it third-quart earn report that new product account for an amaz 79% of it quarterli revenue. Furthermore, total revenu increas 23% year over year, 60% of it custom were new, and 20% of it custom reactiv after be inact for 90 or more days. Thi would impli strong new traffic to the brand.Imag source: Fitbit.But I'll also admit that I wa wrong advoc that Fitbitcould be pois for a reboundback in October. Despit heavili reinvest in it new products, the launch of those product, and marketing, all Fitbit got out of it wa significantli lower margin and a reduc profit forecast. There' no deni that revenu rose 23% in Q3 2016 from Q3 2015, but just 11% of that wa an increas in unit sold. The remaind wa compris of price increas on it products. Thi would suggest that interest in Fitbit' product could be ebbing, even with a lot of extra money be spent on innov and marketing. The company' lower fourth-quart guidanc could impli a year-over-year declin in unit sold, with a higher averag sell price of those unit lead to growth.Fitbit will also need to overcom the stigma of wearabl technolog that it' noth more than a fad. In other words, can Fitbit get custom to continu upgrad their devic in the same fashion that consum upgrad their smartphon everi year or two? Base on the data releas dure the third quarter, it doesn't look as if Fitbit' product are reson enough with exist custom yet. That could change, but I wouldn't look for 2017 to be the year we see thi ramp up in upgrades.Though Fitbit is on track to see it sale climb by more than 50% between 2015 and 2019, I'd suggest keep your distanc from thi growth stock in 2017.10 stock we like better than Tesla MotorsWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

U.S. Solar Record Installations: The Future is Getting Brighter For Clean Energy,12/15/2016,"Accord to a new report by GTM Research and the Solar Energi Industri Association, the third quarter of 2016 wa a record quarter for the U.S. solar industry. 4.14 GW of solar wa installed, nearli as much as all of the solar instal in 2013 (4.76 GW). For all of 2016, the research predict 14.1 GW of solar will be installed, enough to power 2.3 million homes.Thi is an interest find consid the challeng solar stock have face thi year.First Solar(NASDAQ: FSLR) ,SunPower(NASDAQ: SPWR) ,Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) , andVivint Solar(NYSE: VSLR) have all seen their stock plung for a varieti of reasons. And it' those detail within the report that are worth examining.makeArticleAd();Imag source: Getti Images.Th biggest solar segment by a long shot77% of all solar instal in the U.S. last quarter wa util scale, which ha help First Solar and SunPow as two of the country' largest installers. But we knew late 2016 wa go to be good as develop complet project contract to go onlin by the end of the year.Imag source: GTM Research and Solar Energi Industri AssociationQ4 2016 Solar Market Insight.An interest takeaway from the report is that 2017 is shape up to be a littl better than expected. Corpor custom are buy energi from solar projects, and a polici known as PURPA that allow clean energi project to be built if they'r lower cost than the avoid cost of fossil fuel is drive adoption.Th low cost of util solar is start to take hold, and over the next few year it' the cost advantag that will drive greater adoption. For now, it' good news that 2016' record year may not be follow by a complet terribl 2017.Commerci solar is becom a strengthOn major bright spot wa commerci solar, which wa up 15% sequenti and 37% from a year ago. Thi report includ commun solar in the commercial, or non-residential, segment, so that help the growth figures.What' worth point out is that commerci custom are find solar attract to purchas and develop are figur out way to financ projects. That' a new trend in 2016, and as cost come down and financ becom avail we could see a boom in commerci project in the same way we saw in residenti solar from 2010 to 2015.Residenti solar is have a tough timeSpeak of residenti solar, it' becom harder and harder to sell increment rooftop solar systems, a challeng that led to a shrink market in the third quarter. Instal were down 10% sequenti and 2% from a year ago.Ther were strength in new market like Utah, Texas, and South Carolina, but big market like California are actual in decline. Nation instal like SolarC and Vivint Solar are also deal with a ""quicker than expected"" custom shift from leas and power purchas agreement to loans.Despit the declin in residenti solar last quarter, thi remain a segment with a lot of potenti long-term. A rel small number of state -- includ California, Massachusetts, and Arizona -- have long account for most rooftop solar demand, and as more state open up the segment will grow. But it could be a choppi transition, particularli for compani without flexibl busi model to adapt to custom preference.What we learn in Q3 2016Overall, the solar industri is hit record level primarili becaus of it cost competit in a grow number of states. And investor should take some comfort in the fact that demand for util project in 2017 is grow and commerci demand is pick up steam.With that said, the next year or two will be challeng for residenti solar as well as util demand in some states. Investor will want to look at the industri cautiously, becaus record high demand doesn't mean everyon in the solar industri is see a bright future.10 stock we like better than Vivint SolarWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Anoth yet-to-be-announc model from Jaguar Land Rover is also head to Graz, possibl in 2018.Apparently, there' demand for even more, and one factori might not be enough. In a German-languageinterviewwith Germany'sAutomobil Produktion, Apfalt said that the Graz factori is like to hit it maximum product capac by the end of 2018, if not before.""W are look at potenti locat in Europe, North America, and China,"" for a new factory, Apfalt said.

General Motors' Chevy Bolt Just Officially Beat Tesla Motors to Market,12/14/2016,"Gener Motors(NYSE: GM) said that it deliv it first three Chevrolet Bolt EV to pay custom on Tuesday, fulfil a promis made by CEO Mari Barra that sale of the innov electr car would begin by the end of 2016.What GM said about the first Chevi Bolt salesGM said that the first Bolt to be sold at retail were deliv to three custom at Fremont Chevrolet in Fremont, California.

""All of the hard work that the Chevrolet team have put into designing, engin and build the Bolt EV bring us to thi truli satisfi moment of make the first deliveri to custom on time, as planned,"" said Alan Batey, presid of GM North America and Chevrolet brand chief. ""Chevrolet is proud to offer a vehicl like the Bolt EV, with ground-break technolog wrap in a modern design that is also fun to drive at an afford price.""For now, GM is build and ship onli a small number of Chevi BoltsGM is roll it littl electr crossov out slowly, current build about 100 Bolt a day, accord to an Automot News report.GM' factori in Orion, Michigan is reportedli build about 100 Bolt a day.

The Tesla were design to compet head-to-head with German luxuri cars, but the Bolt wa creat with ride-hail and car-shar duti in mind: It' essenti a 21st centuri taxicab.Th Bolt is a fine choic for someon who want an electr commut car with good acceler and a roomi back seat, but nobodi will call it sexi like a Model S.That would put the Bolt at a disadvantag (at retail, at least) if Tesla had a car in the Bolt' price range. That car, the Tesla Model 3, is in development. Tesla hope to have it in product by the end of 2017, though mani analyst think mid- to late 2018 is more realistic. Either way, that give GM a window of opportunity.Th Bolt isn't a Tesla -- but unlik Tesla' upcom ""affordable"" Model 3, it' avail now. That give GM a chanc to poach some buyer from the Silicon Valley automaker.On last thought: The locat of the first Bolt EV sale wa no accidentBi the way, I don't think it wa a coincid that the first Bolt were deliv in Fremont, California. Tesla' factori is in Fremont, and I think GM enjoy give it electr rival a poke in the eye. After all, GM did beat Tesla to market with an afford long-rang electr car.Don't get too offended, Tesla fans: GM ha done thi kind of thing with it crosstown Detroit rival (and vice-versa) for decades.

Why Fiat Chrysler Automobiles' Electric Minivan Could Be a Hit,12/13/2016,"Fiat Chrysler Automobiles(NYSE: FCAU) plan to unveil a fulli electr vehicl base on the Chrysler Pacifica minivan at the Consum Electron Show (CES) in La Vega next month, accord to a Bloombergreport.FCA is also work on a battery-electr Maserati sport car that will aim to compet with the premium electr fromTesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) , the report said.makeArticleAd();Th stylish Chrysler Pacifica Minivan is alreadi avail as a plug-in hybrid. Is a fulli electr version the next step? Imag source: Fiat Chrysler Automobiles.What do we know about the new electr Pacifica?W don't know much. Officially, FCA hasn't said anyth at all, and the Bloomberg report, which cite unnam ""peopl familiar with the plans,"" wa short on details.But we can draw some conclus from the fact that it will reportedli be base on the Pacifica, rather than on a small car or crossover. For starters, it seem like that the choic of the Pacifica, and the decis to unveil the new electr at CES, are signal that thi new electr model will be more than a so-cal ""complianc car.""What' a ""complianc car""?Battery-electr vehicl that were develop from model origin design for intern combustion, likeFord'sFocu Electr and FCA' own Fiat 500e, are often (and somewhat derisively) refer to as ""complianc cars.""Vehicl like these tend to have rang of around 100 mile (or less) compromis in their packag (batteri fill much of the former trunk, for instance), and high prices. Enthusiast argu that they seem less about draw eager custom and more about satisfi a regulatori requir as cheapli as possible.Whi should we think the electr Pacifica will be more than that?Well, first of all, FCA alreadi ha a complianc car, the aforement Fiat 500e. It doesn't need another.But there are other reason whi FCA might have chosen the Pacifica as the basi for it first longer-rang EV. The Pacifica is a new design that is alreadi avail in a plug-in hybrid version. That plug-in Pacifica is a technolog advanc vehicl -- enough so that it waschosen as a test platformforAlphabet' Googl Self-Driv Car Project.But more to the point, the plug-in hybrid drivetrain wa part of the Pacifica' engin from the start, not tack on later. As you can see from the cutaway illustr below, the hybrid batteri pack is below the van' floor. It doesn't take too much imagin to visual a larger batteri pack in the same gener location, especi if the gasolin engin is replac by a much smaller electr motor.Imag source: Fiat Chrysler Automobiles.It' veri possibl that the Pacifica wa engin from the start with the possibl of a larger batteri pack in mind, one that would give an electr Pacifica a rang of 200 mile or so.An electr minivan with good rang and a mass-market price would be an intrigu product. Fold in the Pacifica' unusu (for a minivan) stylish good looks, and it could catch on as an afford altern to Tesla' Model X for green-mind famili that need a big kid-hauler.What about that electr Maserati?Back in 2014, FCA' Maserati brand show a prototyp of a sleek high-perform coup call the Alfieri. A product version is expect to arriv around 2019, and there have been strong hint from the compani that an all-electr Alfieri will follow about a year later.A product version of 2014' Maserati Alfieri concept car is expect to arriv in 2019. An electr version could arriv a year or so later. Imag source: Fiat Chrysler Automobiles.A with everyth have to do with FCA, particularli when it come to the Alfa Romeo and Maserati brands, it' veri possibl that schedul will slip and product will be delay or changed. But the industri rumor mill strongli suggest that the company' current plan is to deliv an electr coup that will probabl look veri similar to the show car pictur above.What would thi mean for Fiat Chrysler?It' a big shift for FCA. CEO Sergio Marchionn ha said repeatedli that he think it will be year befor batteri cost fall to the point where electr car make busi sense.But despit that concern, he said in June that he want FCA to experi more with electr drivetrains. He ha recent push FCA to more aggress embrac other advanc technologies, includ partnership with potenti disrupt Silicon Valley giants.In addit to partner with Googl on self-driving, FCA is also work withAmazon.comon a pilot program tosel car directli to custom online. It' possibl that we will learn in Januari that FCA ha found one or more partner to help speed it electric-car develop as well.What' next for FCA' electric-vehicl effort?Again, it' hard to say until we have a better idea of what the compani is planning. We should know much more after FCA make it present at CE on Jan. 3.10 stock we like better than Fiat Chrysler AutomobilesWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

That satellit radio is atransitori technologyat risk of becom obsolete. The smartphon revolut as well as the grow popular of connect car instil the belief that internet radio - not satellit radio - is the future.Merg With PandoraCNBC report that internet radio giantPandora Media Inc(NYSE:P) is open to an acquisit by Siriu XM.

Such a merger will effect reduc fear that Siriu XM is go away sometim soon, as it will address the oncom forc of Internet radio by … well, join it.A RBC analystMark Mahaneysaid, thi would allow Siriu XM to diversifi it revenu stream as well as custom base. Siriu current depend on subscript for it revenue; Pandora' sale come primarili on ad dollars.Moreover, have access to Pandora' custom would give SIRI stock an avenu for upsells.

He hint that the video servic would launch next year.It' unclear whether Siriu is plan to monet the video content base on it tradit subscript model. We'll have to wait until the servic launches. If SIRI take the rout of make it video content avail on subscription, it' difficult to see how it'll yield ani signific growth for the company. The internet is litter with ton of free video servic already. Not mani folk will be will to pay for it, except the servic somehow come bundl with the usual sat-rad subscription.Th smarter rout to take would be use the video content to simpli grow Siriu XM' popularity, thereby, allow for improv organ growth of it radio business.

Tesla's Price Target Slashed: What You Need to Know,12/12/2016,"Monday is open on a down note forTesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) investors.Thi morning, analyst at Deutsch Bank announc they are resum coverag onTesla stock. That' the good news. The bad news is that Deutsch doesn't realli like what it sees. Accord to the analyst, the stock that ha lost 12% of it valu over the past year might rebound slightli in 2017 -- but not nearli so much as we onc hoped. Deutsch is reduc it price target on Tesla stock from $290 to just $215. And while thi new target is about 12% abov where Tesla share sit today, Deutsch is onli rate Tesla stock hold -- not buy.makeArticleAd();Her are three thing you need to know about why.Tesla is re-envis the electr car with it Model 3 sedan. Imag source: Getti Images.1. Challeng assumptionsTesla ha famous boast that it expect toramp vehicl product to 500,000 unitsannu -- most of them budget-model Model 3 sedan -- by 2018. Previously, Deutsch took that promis on faith, and built a valuat model on Tesla stock that assum the compani would hit it 2018 goal, then go on to produc as mani as 650,000 Model 3s annual by 2020 -- but now, Deutsche' not so sure.Accord to a write-up onStreetInsider.comthi morning, Deutsch still believ that ""EV growth will surpris as cost converg with ICEs."" But the analyst is pull back from it previou predict of 650,000 unit sold in 2020, and now predict Tesla will sell onli 450,000 Model 3s that year.2. Trust, but verifyMind you, Deutsche' new estim doesn't necessarili mean that Elon Musk' estim is wrong. If Tesla were to produc 450,000 Model 3s in 2020 (a Deutsch now predicts), and produc a few more Model S units, Model X units, and perhap a hand of redesign Roadster -- it could still reach Musk' goal of 500,000 total electr car produc in 2018, 2019, and 2020, as well. All Deutsch is say is that it' decid to build ""addit conservat into our assumpt for the Model 3 ramp.""Even so, Deutsche' new estim impli less free cash flow be gener by Tesla. And base on this, the analyst is cut it ""discount cash flow derived"" target on Tesla' car business, yield an impli price target of $214 on thi half of the company, instead of the previou target of $290.3. What about the rest of Tesla?If you'v notic by now that $214 is not the same thing as $215, then kudo for pay attention. Here' how Deutsch explain that tini disconnect: The final piec of the Tesla puzzl is SolarCity, the solar power busi that Teslaacquiredlast month. Mani investorsoppos thi movebi Tesla when it wa first announced. Surprisingly, Deutsch is not one of them.A detail in it report, Deutsch believ that Tesla-qua-Tesla is worth $214 today, base on where the analyst think it will be in 2020. The analyst proce to discount that valu by $14 base on an assumpt that Tesla willdilut it stockholderswith addit share issuanc to cover a $2.5 billion shortfal in cash requir between now and 2020. Thi bring the valu of Tesla' car busi down to $200. What take it up again to$215i the valu of ad SolarC to the mix.Albeit Deutsch doesn't think SolarC is worth the $20.45 that it share end up sell for, it doe admit that ""with SCTi we deriv a target of $215"" -- $200 for the car business, and anoth $15 for SolarCity.Th most import thing: SkepticismEven after all thi math and even after convincingitselfthat Tesla stock is worth 12% more than it current costs, Deutsch Bank still cannot bring itself to recommend that anyon actual buy Tesla shares. I think that' a prudent call.A Deutsche' recommend demonstrates, valu Tesla today requir a lot of assumpt -- about the rate at which Tesla can ramp electr car production, about the car-buy public' willing to switch from gasoline-pow automobil to electrics, and about Tesla' need to dilut sharehold with addit share issuanc en rout to an eventu profit future. Meanwhile, Tesla continu to lose money ($874 million over the past 12 months, accord to data fromS&P Global Market Intelligence) and burn cash ($876 million in neg free cash flow).Until those fact change, Tesla remain a specul stock.10 stock we like better than Tesla MotorsWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Tesla stock or Appl stock? Which stock should investor entrust their hard-earn money to?Source: TeslaNot an easi decision,thenor now.makeArticleAd();In hindsight, the quick answer to that question is Apple, whose stock ha appreci 16.3% over the past 26 month compar to a 32.8% declin in the TSLA stock price. It' ironic, though, given that Tesla' recent quarter have seen some of it best financi number in the company' history, while Appl is mire in sale declines.Whi is Tesla stock revers it field?

Doe it realli need thi distract as push toward profitability? TSLA' downward trend say investor think not.Can Tesla get the cost of produc a vehicl in the vicin of it gas-pow peers? Industri expert say it cost Tesla $81,000 to produc a singl vehicle. Hedg fund manag Mark Spiegel reckon with economi of scale and the use of steel instead of aluminum, Tesla could drop that number to $48,000, 27% higher than the suggest price of it new, supposedli afford Model 3.Competitor likeGener Motor Company(NYSE:GM) are purpos ramp up their electr carproductionso they can offset the great fuel consumpt of the Chevi Bolt and Volt against their bigger SUV ga guzzlers.If the market for electr vehicl expand beyond the 2% to 3% of total vehicl produc everi year, the consensu is that Tesla won't be abl to keep up.Look,I'm a fan of Elon Musk. It' not Donald Trump who will make America great. It' brilliantli passion peopl like the Tesla CEO who will - hand down.""In keep with a fast-grow technolog company, all free cash flow is plow back into R&D to drive down the cost and bring the follow product to market as fast as possible,"" Elon Muskwrotein 2006.

If you'r between 10 and 20 year to retirement, I'd go with AAPL stock. And if you'r 20 or more away from hang them up, I'd go with Tesla stock.""Nothing' chang in my opinion.Assum an averag retir age of 65, I'm comfort recommend that investor 45 or younger serious consid TSLA stock for their retir accounts. Of course, mani 401k plan - which most peopl have - either don't allow individu stock or make it cost prohibitive.If you have a 401k, where it make sense, buy Tesla, and if it continu to go lower, you'v got load of time for it to recover.

Market Fallout From the EPA's Rush Decision,12/8/2016,"With the sun set on the Obama presidency, the administr and govern agenc are move quickli to set in stone as mani regul as possibl befor President-elect Donald Trump take office. With that in mind, the Environment Protect Agenc recent announc that is move to final it 2025 corpor averag fuel economi (CAFE) emiss target well ahead of it 2018 deadline. While thi would not be imposs for a Trump administr to roll back, the auto industri ha no choic but to move forward as if thi aggress target will be the law of the land.Imag source: Getti Images.makeArticleAd();Th EPA will requir automak to have a fleet averag of 54.5 mile per gallon. If that look like a high number to you, it' becaus it is. Offici test number are alway higher than real-world result -- theWal Street Journalexpect the actual number to be closer to 40 mpg, but even then it' still a huge gap to bridge.Currently, vehicl averag 24.8 mpg in real-world use. While we have seen a huge, 28% improv in effici over the last decad -- thanks, in part, to forc induction, direct injection, and stop-start technolog -- that onli equat to 5.5 mile per gallon. A similar effici increas would leav us just over 30 mpg and well short of the EPA' mandate.There' onli one way to meet thi aggress goal: a massiv increas in electr vehicl sale over the next decade. Signific effort to achiev thi goal are alreadi underway. The implic of thi have flown under the market' radar, give investor an opportun to be ahead of the curve.On winnerTesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) is pois to be a winner despit increas direct competit from establish luxuri player and downward price pressur from mass-market manufacturers. Unlik legaci automakers, Tesla won't be burden by attempt to juggl the production, sales, and mainten of two differ propuls system to meet these new stringent regulations.Tesla is also better posit and further along it transit from pure carmak to mobil provider. Investor should not underestim the signific of the automaker' Gigafactori -- it massiv scale lower cost and enabl the compani to becom a batteri supplier to the rest of the industry.Volkswageni plan to build it own batteri product facil in Germany, but smaller automak may declin the huge up-front cost of a vertic integr suppli chain. Given it execut risk and premium valuation, Tesla may not be the safest play for investors, but I anticip it will remain a leader in the space.On loserSuppli who deriv a larg portion of their revenu from powertrain systems, likeDelphiAutomotive(NYSE: DLPH) , will face stagnation, if not eros of that busi over the come decades. Delphi' largest unit is still electrical/electron architecture, but 28% of it net sale in 2015 were tie to the intern combust engine.Th rise of electrif and advanc drive technolog ha also given rise to new competitors. Take, for instance,Gener Motors'(NYSE: GM) Chevrolet Bolt, a $37,500 mass-market EV with a 200-mile range. The Bolt' batteri pack, motors, and infotain system are suppli by South Korean consumer-electron giantLG.Thi is not simpli an anecdot point. As car transit toward becom giant self-driv smartphones, the OEM will requir a set of solut more easili suppli by larg tech companies. Current supplier need forward-think management, plu a commit to innovation, and even then they still may come up short.Th Foolish bottom lineWhil auto industri insid may be grumbl about the EPA' aggress move to final without further debate, the requir itself are not a surpris -- the industri agre to these term in 2012. Given the long lead time of auto develop and the giant step up in requirements, it' onli a matter of time befor consum have a varieti of electr option at differ price point from most automakers.W can't afford to think of thi as just a typic cyclic industri industri anymore. Major upheav is on the cusp of happening, and a forward-look view of the new automot landscap will reward investors.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunityTh world' biggest tech compani forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analyst and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There' a small compani that' power their brand-new gadget and the come revolut in technology.

Why Rising Oil Prices Are Good for EVs and Renewable Energy,12/8/2016,"If you'r a fan of wind power, solar power, electr vehicles, or ani other form of altern energi or transportation, you should be cheer OPEC' recent announc agreement to cut 1.8 million barrel per day in product from both OPEC and non-OPEC countries' supply. Most of the reaction on the stock market relat to oil stock surging, but thi is realli great news for altern energi as well.Th reason come down to the other half of the energi equat we often don't talk about. The simpl fact of the matter is that mani in the industri are begin to talk regularli about how quickli the cost of solar energi is fall or how cheap batteri for electr vehicl (EVs) are becoming. But the other side is the fossil fuel energi they'r compet against. Higheroil pricesmak EV more attract on a cost basi and will make corporations, consumers, and govern think twice about where they'r spend energi dollar in the future. Rise oil price is the push altern need.makeArticleAd();Imag source: Getti Images.Th dollar drive everythingIf you look at the grow adopt of solar energy, wind energy, energi storage, and electr vehicl -- the four biggest cog in a renew energi futur -- they'v all been driven primarili by econom over the past decade.Tesla's(NASDAQ: TSLA) SolarC subsidiari grew on the back of a $0 down solar leas and wind and solar energi are win competit bid for electr contract around the world. New technolog like energi storag are help commerci custom lower electr bill and cost are improv constantly. To top it off, EV are start to take off just as car price around $35,000 are hit the market.Subsidi get a lot of coverag in the media, but non-fossil fuel form of energi are compet with fossil fuel becaus they'r a lower-cost option and that cost advantag is improv by the day. Higher oil price onli improv the competit advantag of altern energy, which make it more attract to buyer like util and corpor make choic about where they'r go to get energi in the future.Th percept battl in energyOn of the strang dynam in energi is that oil domin percept of what sourc of energi are competitive. Even in solar energy, where the competit is realli with coal and natur gas, when oil is high peopl love the idea of solar energy, and when oil is low investor just don't believ in the solar future.Thi can be seen on the stock market, where solar manufactur and developersFirst Solar(NASDAQ: FSLR) andSunPower(NASDAQ: SPWR) have long been impact directli by the price of oil. Look below at their perform as oil price drop in 2014. As oil fell, so did their stocks, even though they'r not realli relat businesses.WTI Crude Oil Spot Pricedata byYCharts.Wheth you'r think about put solar on your roof or buy your next vehicle, the percept of energi price is just as import as the real price you pay for energy. And increas oil and gasolin price are mayb the best remind of what energi costs, whether or not they directli compet with altern sourc of energy.Wher we can expect to see winnersIf oil price do rise, I would expect that to have a major impact on the adopt rate of electr vehicles. Tesla is clearli lead the charg there led by the Model S and upcom Model 3, butGener Motors'(NYSE: GM) Chevi Bolt hit the market later thi year will be worth watch if gasolin head toward $4 per gallon again. EV can justifi themselv on econom alon if ga price rise. It cost about $12 to fill a Model S with over 300 mile of range, compar to $40 or more if ga is $4 per gallon. So, rise ga price will make EV more competit just as low cost EV hit the market.Solar and wind energi will also be winners, particularli on the util side.

The companylaid off a few dozen employeeswho had been work on the project, nicknam Titan, just a few month after name Appl veteran Bob Mansfield as chief of the Appl car project. The sudden (and mostli unexpected) chang suggest to current and would-b owner of AAPL stock that thing were not go swimmingli on the autonom vehicl front.makeArticleAd();Source:Beni Krausz via UnsplashA it turn out, the market may have read a littl too much into the restructuring.Though Appl may well be back off on it plan to develop it own car, as a letter recent submit to the Nation Highway Traffic Safeti Administr (NHTSA) suggest the compani ha put the pedal to the metal with it plan to build an artifici intellig system that can drive a car.Appl ""Invest Heavili In Machin Learning""In alett written by Apple' VP of Product Integrity, Steve Kenner, to the NHSTA on Nov. 22, Appl noted:""Execut properli under NHTSA' guidance, autom vehicl have the potenti to greatli enhanc the human experi - to prevent million of car crash and thousand of fatal each year … It is vital that those develop and deploy autom vehicl follow rigor safeti principl in design and production. Such principl should not, however, inhibit compani from make consequenti progress; there is no need to compromis safeti or innovation.Appl affirm that, in order to best protect the travel public and keep up with the pace of innovation, NHSTA should expedit request for exempt and interpret and petit for rulemaking. NHTSA and Congress should also continu to explor new tool and author like those outlin in Section IV of the Polici - includ expand exempt author - with the goal of foster innovation, improv regulatori flexibility, and encourag the develop of life-sav technology.""Translation: Appl is veri much behind the eight-bal in term of develop self-driv systems, and unless the Nation Highway Traffic Safeti Administr help the compani out in a big way, AAPL sharehold are go to be sever disappoint that Appl didn't capit on the opportun when it could have done so sever year ago.7 A-Rat Tech Stock That Power the IndustryRiv alreadi work on machine-learn for the purpos of autonom car are, of course,Tesla Motor Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA),Gener Motor Company(NYSE:GM) andAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG), just to name a few. GM alreadi ha a fleet ofabout 30 autonom vehiclesin testing, and the technolog now comesstandard on all Teslas. Alphabet - Googl - ha alreadi put2 million mile on it fleet of autonom cars.It' not clear where the develop of the self-driv Appl car technolog is. It is clear, though, it' not nearli as far along as the platform creat by other in the space. It ha got a lot of catch up to do. The letter to the NHTSA wa meant to be a mean of keep that door open.Bottom Line for AAPL StockAppl spokesman Tom Neumayrad to the discuss on Friday of last week:""We'v provid comment to NHTSA becaus Appl is invest heavili in machin learn and autonom systems. … There are mani potenti applic for these technologies, includ the futur of transportation, so we want to work with NHTSA to help defin the best practic for the industry.""It' Neumayr' thought that realli add some much-need color to the matter … that,and the notion that""establish manufactur and new entrant should be treat equally.""In short, Appl know it' behind it competition, but after spend an untold amount of money on the develop of self-driv automobil technology, it can't walk away empty-hand now.Perhap the most noteworthi thing owner of AAPL stock may want to digest is that Kenner' letter wa neither solicit nor required. The NHTSA is simpli open to hear suggest about how it can most effect shape it guidelin for the advent of autonom cars. Apple' suggest just so happen to be favor to Apple' present situat on the R&D front; the agenc isn't requir to take them.Expedia Inc (EXPE) Spinoff Trivago Near IPO TakeoffIn a bigger sense, the fact that a five-pag plea wa submit at all at thi stage of the game could be an indirect sign that Appl is simpli too far behind in thi race to ever meaning catch up.That' OK. Such a platform wa never entir in the company' wheelhous anyway. Unless it work-to-d is close to be a finish project though - someth Appl could plug into a car in the veri near futur with littl addit cost - AAPL sharehold may find the autonom car project is a littl too fruitless to continu supporting.A of thi writing, Jame Brumley did not hold a posit in ani of the aforement securities.Mor From InvestorPlaceTh Best Invest for 2017The 10 Biggest Stock Market Success of 2016The postAppl Inc.

"Thanks to Tesla Motors' Brilliance, Some Auto Suppliers Face Rapidly Approaching Challenges",12/1/2016,"Tesla' Model 3. Imag source: Tesla Motors.Tesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) , one of the few electr vehicl start-up to surviv the financi crisi and the Great Recession, ha done an incred job of rebrand the electr vehicle. At a time when mani consum pictur an electr vehicl as a small, awkward-look car that struggl to reach 50 mile per hour on the highway, Tesla wa design the Model S, which would leav those stereotyp in the dust. While major automakers' EV program remain in their infancy, or neglected, Tesla wa establish it Supercharg network to allevi rang anxieti and wa break ground on it Gigafactory.Tesla, despit it manufactur flaw and unpredict strategi (cough,SolarCityacquisition,cough), ha lit a fire under major automak to acceler their own EV programs. And that spell bad news for a cluster of auto supplier stocks.makeArticleAd();What' the big deal?Morgan Stanley' analyst Adam Jona explain the issu in a note to investors, while cut hi price target onDelphi Automotive(NYSE: DLPH) from $74 down to $59:Roughli 25% of Delphi' global profit come from it powertrain division, a collect of busi that optim the combust of diesel and gasolin through highli engin pumps, inject systems, fuel delivery, exhaust flow, emiss canisters, throttl controls, and sophist control modules. We'r not suggest these product will be replac immediately, but we do see scope for diminish econom return given chang OEM prioriti that creat materi risk to the company' earn trajectory.To make matter wors for auto supplier stocks, that' far from the onli risk. Their margin would be squeez if the price of steel, copper, aluminum, and other raw materi move higher after year of weakness. Combin that with the fact that major automak have begun to consolid vehicl platform and part in an effort to increas their scale and reduc the number of supplier -- that mean less price power for suppliers, year after year. In fact,Gener Motorsplan to move from 14 core and 12 region vehicl architectur in 2015 down to 4 vehicl set by 2025. And that' leav out the obviou risk that auto supplier are tie to a highli cyclic auto industry, and that a key global market, America, appear to be plateau after year of consist growth. Not to mention, we'r not sure how President-elect Donald Trump' NAFTA threat will play out for the auto industry.Now, it' not as if the execut at auto supplier don't see the loom risks, but so far, they haven't been quick to adapt. Also, it appear that Tesla, approach the releas of it mass-afford Model 3, is look past tradit suppliers. ""Tesla is turn to South Korean part makers, which are more cost-competit than Japanes rivals, as the electr car start-up plan to drastic cut cost for the cheaper Model 3,"" said Eim Eun-young, an auto analyst at Samsung Securities, accord toAutomot News.Al is not lostDespit loom headwinds, there are auto supplier better suit to survive, and there will be way for other to evolve, as none of thi will happen overnight. For instance,Lear Corp(NYSE: LEA) is focus on vehicl trend that would be less impact by electr vehicles, such as automot electronics, higher-qu interiors, and part in the luxuri segment.Magna Intern Inc.(NYSE: MGA) , as anoth example, ha a massiv global footprint that is extrem import to major automak and gener almost half of it sale from Detroit automakers, which will continu to produc a plethora of truck and SUV for the forese future.Delphi even ha ambiti plan beyond electr vehicles. It ha announc a partnership withMobileyeandIntelto collabor on develop self-driv car technology. The goal is to develop a complet turnkey ""SAE Level 4/5 autom drive solution"" -- a system that manufactur could purchase, rather than research and develop on their own.Al is not lost for auto supplier stocks, but they'r trade at cheap valuat for a reason, and you can hardli blame investor for sit thi one out until supplier prove they can adapt and grow their top line in an auto industri that' pois to chang more in the next two decad than it ha in the past century.10 stock we like better than Tesla MotorsWhen invest genius David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.
