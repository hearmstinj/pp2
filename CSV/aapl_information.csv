5 Technology Companies That Could IPO in 2017;3/14/2017;"After a tepid 2016, the Initial Public Offering (IPO) market has been rejuvenated in 2017, primarily on the back of the recent $24 billion Snap Inc. IPO. Snap's public market debut was the biggest technology IPO since Alibaba's in 2014 and the second-largest U.S. technology based IPO ever, behind onlyFacebookFB, its closest competitor and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank   stocks here.makeArticleAd();Snap's blockbuster IPO clearly demonstrated investors' pent-up demand for technology companies. The loss-making company sold 200 million non-voting shares for $17 per share, above the expected range of $14-$16. Shares were up a massive 44% from its IPO price at the very first day of trading.Snap's hit IPO has opened up flood gates for the next round of public money seekers. This includes the likes of Mule Soft, Alteryx, Carbon Black, AppNexus, Forescout, and Cloudera, all of which are primarily tech unicorns (emerging technology companies that have a valuation of more than $1 billion).However, two high profile technology companies - Uber and Airbnb - are not expected to debut this year as both of them have raised funds in recent times.  Reportedly, Uber raised $3.5 billion from the investment arm of Saudi Arabia in Jun 2016. Airbnb recently closed $1 billion in funding, which puts the company's valuation at $31 billion.Technology IPO Market is HotAlthough Snap's recent price slide is a deterrent to IPO investors, we note that most of the issues are company specific. In fact, we believe that the current macro-economic environment is most conducive for IPO investing based on President Donald Trump's plan of spending $1 trillion on U.S. infrastructure overhauling along with regulatory and tax reforms.We note that lowering of tax rate from 35% to 15% - as proposed by President Trump during his campaign days - will be beneficial to small and mid-cap companies, particularly in the technology sector. This will surely attract IPO investors to this market going ahead.The IPO pipeline remains strong as evident from recent Renaissance Capital data, which showed that 25 IPOs have already been filed this year, up 13.6% compared with the same period last year. Moreover, technology trails only healthcare in filing most IPOs in the last 12 months.Further, ongoing consolidation in the technology market provides a significant opportunity for investors to buy new stocks that have significant growth prospects over the long term.Tech IPOs for the Rest of 2017If a favorable environment prevails, there are a number of privately funded technology companies that can taste the appetite of IPO investors in the rest of 2017. Among them, we would love to see the following five company's debut this year.Headquartered in San Francisco,Cloudflareoffers content distribution network (CDN) and distributed denial of service (DDoS) mitigation services. Per VentureBeat, the company has more than 4 million customers including the likes of CiscoCSCO, Nasdaq among others. In Sep 2015, the company raised $110 million from strategic investors like Google Capital, MicrosoftMSFT, BaiduBIDUand QualcommQCOM.Another San Francisco-based companyDropboxhas been a IPO candidate for a long-time. Dropbox is a file backup service that offers cloud-based file management, storage systems and client software. It enables users to access and synchronize files, and use applications through multiple devices. The company boasts of more than 500 million users. Per Tech Crunch, the company had raised $350 million at a valuation of $10 billion way back in 2014.Palo Alto-basedPalantir Technologiesanalyzes Big Data and is best known for two different software projects - ""Palantir Gotham"" and ""Palantir Metropolis"". It also offers a wide variety of solutions related to fraud identification, homeland and cyber security, disaster preparedness, and investing. Numerous government agencies are its customers. Late 2015, the company completed a funding round that raised $880 million and put its valuation at $20 billion.

The startup is a competitor of Microsoft Office 365 as well as Atlassian's HipChat. Per Recode, the company has two million active daily users and 800,000 subscribers.Music streaming service providerSpotifyhad been valued at over $8.5 billion in 2016, when it raised $526 million. Per Reuters, investors included Northzone, Creandum, DST Global and Accel Partners. The company has almost 50 million paid users in around 60 countries.

Intel Corp. and Qualcomm, Inc.: On a Collision Course;3/14/2017;"For years, there has been very little intersection betweenIntel's(NASDAQ: INTC) core businesses andQualcomm's(NASDAQ: QCOM) . Intel's revenue today comes primarily from   sales of personal-computer processors, processors for enterprise   and cloud servers, and networking applications.Qualcomm, on the other hand, makes most of its profit from   licensing wireless technologies and patents, and generates most   of its revenue by selling chips that go into smartphones and, to   a lesser extent, other mobile devices like tablets.Image source: Qualcomm.makeArticleAd();For years, it has been widely known that Qualcomm was working   on processors designed to attack Intel's data-center dominance;   first commercial shipments are expected to begin in the second   half of 2017. And for years, Intel has been going on about trying   to attack Qualcomm's wireless-chip business -- achieving its   first real success last year when it captured cellular-modem   share from Qualcomm inApple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) iPhone 7-series smartphones.In other words, these two chip giants are on a collision   course. Let's look at what each side could lose, what each side   stands to gain, and what this coming battle might mean for   investors in either company.Intel deals its major -- but potentially only -- blowIn the past, Intel had told investors that it expected to   compete broadly across the mobile-processor market. Indeed, the   company said it was developing a whole stack of chips, designed   to span everything from low-end smartphones to what the company   referred to as ""hero devices.""In addition to those chips, Intel had been pursuing   stand-alone cellular-modem efforts for quite some time, though   with little success until recently.Investors might be aware that Intel canceled its pipeline of   mobile-processor products and substantially reduced its   investment levels there. (Intel said at its most recent investor   meeting that from 2015 to 2017, its spending in mobile will go   down about 55%.)So, Intel is, by and large, neutralized as a threat to   Qualcomm's mobile-processor business.However, the company won a large portion of the cellular-modem   spots inside Apple's iPhone 7 series of smartphones, which led to   a reasonable bump in revenue for Intel and a corresponding   decrement to Qualcomm's revenues.Qualcomm sharpening its knivesThough Intel's mobile efforts ultimately translated into   Qualcomm losing some business at Apple, Qualcomm's ambitions are   much more significant.Qualcomm announced that it will be working with software giantMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) to bring personal computers running Windows 10 on   Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 processors to market during the second   half of 2017 -- directly attacking Intel's largest business.To make matters worse for Intel (and perhaps sweeten the deal   for Qualcomm), Qualcomm seems committed to developing data-center   processors for now. Significant share gains on Qualcomm's part   (and corresponding share losses on Intel's part) -- should they   occur -- aren't likely to happen overnight.However, Qualcomm's upcoming Centriq 2400 chips havealready gotten Microsoft's blessingfor its internal use, which lends credibility to the notion that   major data-center customers may be willing -- and, frankly, eager   -- to work with alternative suppliers rather than Intel.The upside and downside for each companyFor Intel, the only upside I see in this contest is its   potential to gain some additional cellular-modem share from   Qualcomm at Apple. The opportunity likely isn't that big from the   standpoint of annual revenue, and that revenue would likely come   at a much lower margin than Intel's corporate average. Right now,   Intel's ability to hurt Qualcomm in its core wireless-chip   business seems limited.The upside for Qualcomm, on the other hand, seems greater. It   can take share from Intel in the latter company's core business   of personal-computer chips, as well as its data-center business,   starting from essentially zero share.Intel certainly has significant resources with which to defend   itself, so it's probably not prudent for investors in either   company to model in substantial market-share shifts to Qualcomm   anytime soon. But, in terms of which company has more to gain and   which has more to lose: The answers come up Qualcomm and Intel,   respectively.10 stocks we like better than QualcommWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Will Adobe Systems (ADBE) Surprise in Q1 Earnings Release?;3/14/2017;"Adobe Systems Inc.ADBEis slated to report first-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Mar 16. Last quarter, the company recorded a positive earnings surprise of 15.28%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Shares of Adobe have been have been steadily treading higher over the last one year. The stock returned 40.05% compared with the ZacksComputer-Softwareindustry's gain of 22.44%.Factors to ConsiderAdobe is being driven by continuous innovation in the Creative Cloud and Marketing Cloud businesses.The Creative business under the Digital Media Solutions segment is witnessing acceleration in Creative Cloud subscriptions. Also, the conversion of enterprise customers to Enterprise Term License Agreements (ETLAs) is resulting in higher adoption of its enterprise Creative Cloud offering.Increased subscription as well as ETLA and digital publishing suite adoption should drive Creative Cloud's annualized recurring revenues.We are also positive on Adobe's market position, compelling product lines and balance sheet strength. Additionally, continued adoption of the Adobe marketing cloud could serve as a catalyst in the to-be-reported quarter.Adobe posted strong fiscal fourth-quarter results with both earnings and revenues beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Revenues were up 9.9% sequentially and 23.1% year over year on the back of strong adoption of Creative Cloud.However, lower end-market demand, increasing competition from MicrosoftMSFTand AppleAAPLand significant exposure to the economically troubled European region could be matters of concern.For fiscal first quarter, Adobe expects revenues of $1.625 billion. Based on a share count of 501 million, GAAP earnings are expected to be 71 cents per share and non-GAAP earnings are projected at 87 cents.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Adobe is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positiveEarnings ESPand a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP:Both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 72 cents. Hence, the difference is 0.00%.

3 Reasons Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Is Becoming Tougher to Own;3/14/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBy most accounts, the future looks bright forApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL). Citi recently upped its price target on Apple stock in anticipation of a massive wave of upgrades from iPhone owners who have aging models, and the company's plans to double its high-margin service revenue over the course of the coming four years doesn't seem un-doable.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockAfter all, AAPL has been beefing up its app and digital content business at a rather brisk pace for some time now.And yet, to observers not looking at the company through rose-colored glasses, there's potential trouble ahead. Here's a closer look at three headwinds that could slow AAPL shares down more than most traders might expect.Three Troubling Realities for Apple StockLast week, analysts with Citi raised their price target on Apple stock from $140 to $160 per share (maintaining the research outfit's ""Buy"" rating), thinking a wide swath of the 715 million iPhone owners out there right now are on the verge of finally upgrading their device, as31% of those owners haven't upgraded in a couple of years.It's not bad logic; we know the company's best new customers are its old ones.10 Dangerous Dividend Stocks to Dump NowMeanwhile, though it was little more than an afterthought just a year ago, CEO Tim Cook has put plenty of emphasis on sales of services and digital content. He's only scratched the surface, however. After generating roughly $25 billion in revenue in 2016, Apple is aiming for $50 billion in services revenue by $50 billion. That's still only a fraction of the $215 billion worth of revenue Apple mustered in 2016, but digital sales now make up the company's second-biggest segment; the iPhone is still the biggest.Before we pop the corks on the champagne bottles though, there are three red flags everyone would be wise to process.1. The iPhone 8 (probably) costs too muchWhile the launch of the iPhone 7 in the fall of last year could be considered a success in that the company sold arecord-breaking 78.2 million units in the previous quarter, given thehype surrounding the device, the company should have blown away sales figures for its iPhone 6.Some (many) suspect the demand that should have materialized for the 7 was ultimately displaced to the iPhone 8, which is supposed to be unveiled in September of this year. The word is that the admittedly impressive device is going togo for a cool $1000 each. At that price, even the most loyal of Apple fans could balk.2. The popular smartphone is preemptively cannibalizing itselfAside from sticker shock, would-be owners of the upcoming iPhone 8 may keep their wallet closed for the same reason many potential buyers of the iPhone 7 didn't pull the trigger - they're waiting for the phone after the next phone, which is sure to be even more amazing.To that end, what's currently being referred to as the iPhone 9 already promises (in rumors) to be an amazing piece of hardware,complete with a folding screen. That may postpone purchases of the iPhone 8 later this year, though 2018's iPhone 9 could see softer demand because whispers of the iPhone 10 rumors will be circulating by then.It's a vicious cycle, with Apple arguably unable to ever really log a blowout iPhone launch.Fitbit Has BlackBerry Syndrome (FIT)3. The Google Pixel is really, really impressiveFinally, as solid as the recent Pixel phone fromAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) subsidiary Google was, it wasn't a game-changer. Analysts estimate the companyonly sold about 2.5 million of the device.Bear in mind, however, this is Google's first direct foray into the smartphone world, and could be considered little more than a dry run.The Pixel 2 is slated to debut sometime this year, and it's a good bet the company has made a point of learning a lot with its first outing.Bottom Line for AAPL StockInvariably, some (or several) owners of Apple stock interpret these concerns as a call that the company is doomed, and then proceed to ""colorfully disagree."" So, let me clarify something that shouldn't need saying. That is, even on AAPL stock's worst day it's still essentially unstoppable to other smartphone players. Don't read too much into the worries.On the flipside, in that Apple stock is all too often found on investors' pedestals - lifted there by assumptions that the company is infallible - it's never a bad idea to recognize all plausible risks. These three risks could each end up stirring up surprising headwinds, and nothing takes a toll on a stock like an unexpected disappointment.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace7 Blue-Chip Stocks Holding You Back7 Future Blue-Chip Stocks You Need to BuyThe post3 Reasons Apple Inc.

It's Time To Use This Winning Trade Again;3/14/2017;Earnings season is virtually over, and with 99% of the   companies in the S&P 500 reporting, results are a little   better than expected. About two-thirds of companies beat   analysts' expectations, in line with the long-term average rate.   Earnings per share (EPS) came in about 4.9% higher than they were a year ago, the first   time we've seen year-over-year growth in earnings for two   consecutive quarters in two years.It seems as if the earnings outlook should be bullish for the   stock market based on the growth in EPS, but many analysts are   warning that the market is overvalued. Such warnings are often   based on charts like the one below, which shows the   price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is higher than average.This chart looks back at the past 10 years. Interestingly, to   me, the P/E ratio reached its high in the first quarter of 2010,   as the stock market was bottoming. Bears were arguing the market   was overvalued when it was at the beginning of what would prove   to be an extended bull market.You could argue that the recession was an extraordinary time   for the economy and no one could forecast what would happen next.   The president, Congress, the Federal Reserve and regulators were   all doing what they could to boost the economy.I would argue those same sentiments apply to 2017. No one   knows what will happen next on tax policy, regulation or even   interest rate policy. Washington is in turmoil, and upcoming   changes could boost earnings, which might make the current P/E   ratio of 21.5 look like a bargain.We know there is talk of a tax cut. Corporate rates could fall   from 35% to 20% or even lower. These rumored changes are expected   to happen by August, and I believe it will be retroactive to the   beginning of the year. A tax cut of that magnitude would raise   EPS sharply.For now, analysts expect EPS of $131.28 for the companies in   the S&P 500. To be conservative, we can assume the drastic   reduction in taxes increases earnings by just 8%, an amount equal   to about one-third the reduction in rates. This would boost   earnings to $142 a share.A decrease in regulatory costs could also increase company's   bottom lines.It's important to remember these changes don't occur in a   vacuum. Real action from Congress should increase consumer   sentiment, which would be reflected in higher sales and earnings   for large companies. In short, the economy could grow much more   than expected this year, and EPS could be much higher than   expected when the fourth quarter is actually reported.Stocks are pricing in higher earnings, and some analysts   believe current levels are dangerous, as prices could decline if   Congress becomes deadlocked. I see opportunity for now but am   watching closely for signs of irrational exuberance in the   market.While I am bullish in the long run, I do believe caution is   warranted in the short run. Stocks have moved up quickly since   the election, and we've had more than two weeks' worth of   consecutive record highs in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Now   is a time for caution, and I want to turn to a trade with a high   degree of safety, a short-term put sale in Apple (Nasdaq:AAPL).I've successfully sold puts on AAPL five times since July 2016   for annualized returns of 44.8% 27.4%, 25.7%, 64.3% and even   78.9%. Needless to say, it's one of my favorite companies to   generate income from and a common recommendation for myIncome Tradersubscribers.If you want the details of my latest AAPL trade, or would like   to learn more about my put selling strategy,follow this link.Related ArticlesWhy Starbucks' Stock Could Soon Hit Record       LevelsDon't Make These 3 Common Pre-IPO Investing       MistakesA Value Buy In The World's Best Industry

Will Jabil Circuit (JBL) Q2 Earnings Pull Off a Surprise?;3/13/2017;"Jabil Circuit IncJBLis slated to release second-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Mar 15 after the closing bell. Last quarter, the company delivered stronger-than-expected results with a positive earnings surprise of 18.97%. Jabil Circuit has delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 45.61% in the trailing four quarters.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderJabil continues to gain from fast growing sectors like industrial, renewable energy, clean tech and medical. Moreover, the increase in technology spending bodes well for Jabil's top line. Though the company's realignment program will have an adverse effect on its financial position over the next two years, it will eventually boost its growth and market share.On the other hand, Jabil's Diversified Manufacturing Services (DMS) segment suffered owing to weakness in demand for Apple Inc.'sAAPLiPhone. However, with the success of iPhone 7 & and 7 Plus, the performance of the DMS segment should improve. Apple continues to be Jabil's leading customer, accounting for nearly 24% of its total revenue.Nonetheless, escalating market competition and macroeconomic headwinds continue to be concerns.For the second quarter, Jabil expects total company net revenue to decrease 1% (at mid point) year over year and be in the range of $4.2 billion to $4.5 billion. Core operating income is estimated in a range of $125 million to $165 million.On a year-over-year basis, revenues from Diversified Manufacturing are expected to decrease 2% to $1.7 billion, given softness in the mobility business. Electronics Manufacturing Services revenues of $2.65 billon are expected to be flat on a year-over-year basis. Core earnings are expected to be in the range of 35 cents to 57 cents per share.The company expects GAAP earnings in the range of a loss of 18 cents to earnings of 18 cents.Earnings WhisperOur proven model does not conclusively show that Jabil is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positiveEarnings ESPand a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

Pandora will roll out Pandora Premium   on Wednesday, giving music fans the ability to pick out the   actual songs that they want to hear.Pandora Premium is the right product, but it's also easy to   wonder if the music discovery pioneer is too late to this niche.   Spotify andApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) already seem to have the premium on-demand market   carved out with more than 70 million paying subscribers between   the two of them. Where does Pandora fit in?The new service won't win anyone over on price. Pandora   Premium is anchored to the same $9.99 a month price point of   Spotify, with 50 million paid accounts, and Apple Music, which   topped 20 million premium users late last year. A distinctive   feature for Pandora Premium will be how it incorporates elements   of its flagship service that's consumed largely as a free   ad-supported service, but it may not be enough to sway its   current users to pay up, since they're already seemingly getting   what they want for free.makeArticleAd();Image source: Pandora.Around the dialPandora closed out the fourth quarter with 81 million active   listeners, but they are mostly freeloaders. Just 4.39 million of   those active listeners are paying for access to ad-free streams   with less restrictive parameters in a platform called Pandora   Plus. Pandora will give those subscribers six-month trials to   Pandora Premium at no additional cost, a sweet deal since they're   only paying half as much now. How many of those 4.39 million   users will be willing to pay $9.99 a month come September? How   will Pandora smoke out new subscribers? The answers aren't clear,   and this could be why Pandora stock seems to be stuck in a rut   outside of the pockets of time when buyout speculation starts to   percolate.Pandora has a problem with user growth. It had 81.1 million   active listeners a year ago, so its audience base has stalled.   Folks on the platform still spend a lot of time on Pandora, but   it could be because they can't or won't pay Apple, Spotify, or   other tech giants in this crowded field for on-demand   streaming.There's no denying that on-demand streaming is hot. Spotify is   tacking on 10 million more subscribers worldwide every six   months. Apple Music is up to 20 million users in less than two   years, and it has the advantage of pushing subscriptions through   its iOS devices.How will Pandora Plus stand out? Existing Pandora users will   be able to access all of the tracks that they have ever given a   thumbs up to as its own playlist. There's also a feature where   users can pick a song or two and have a playlist automatically   populated based on Pandora's time-tested music-matching   algorithms, but that's close to what they can already enjoy   today.Pandora is late, but it's desperate and hungry. Its chances of   being anything more than a distant bronze medallist in on-demand   streaming -- at best -- are slim, but at least it's now in the   conversation of being trendy and relevant. We won't know until   much later this year if folks on free trials are sticking around,   but current investors should take some degree of comfort in   knowing that expectations are low and the stock price reflects   exactly that.10 stocks we like better than Pandora MediaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

How Apple Inc. Can Keep the Premium iPhone a Step Ahead;3/13/2017;"Later this year,Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is expected to launch a premium iPhone in addition   to two direct successors to today's iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus.   The differentiating features of the new iPhone are expected to be   the use of an OLED display (in contrast to less advanced liquid   crystal displays) as well as a newer, more premium-looking   industrial design.However, at some point -- quite possibly with iPhone models   that will launch in the fall of 2018 -- the more ""mainstream""   iPhone models will see design makeovers and incorporate the newer   OLED display technology.Image source: Apple.makeArticleAd();How, then, after introducing a ""premium"" iPhone in the fall of   2017, can Apple continue to bring out differentiated premium   iPhone models in the years ahead that will be worthy of a   meaningful premium to the ""standard"" models.In this column, I'd like to go over a couple of ways that come   to mind.Better camerasOne of the big selling points of this year's iPhone 7 Plus was   the addition of a dual camera system. Apple used the dual cameras   to enable a 2X optical zoom feature as well as a depth of field   feature (Apple marketed it as ""portrait mode"").Given that Apple reported that the iPhone 7 Plus is proving to   be the company'sbest ""Plus"" model everin terms of mix within the company's iPhone 7-series shipments,   it's probably reasonable to assume that potential customers are   willing to pay more for interesting camera features.Going forward, I could see Apple introducing three tiers of   camera functionality: a baseline camera tier for the standard   iPhone, an upgraded version for the Plus variant, and then a   still more feature-rich camera subsystem for the premium   iPhone.Indeed, as Apple will obviously want to charge more for said   premium iPhone, it should have greater room in its bill of   materials to use more expensive technologies (image sensors,   lenses, etc.)Better processorsToday, Apple uses the same A-series chips for its standard   iPhone and its Plus iPhone model. The only iOS product that gets   a fundamentally better processor is the company's iPad.Going forward, though, it might make sense for Apple to   differentiate its lineup based on the processors inside --   classic performance segmentation. The standard iPhone models   could use the standard A-series chip (i.e. A11, A12, etc.) while   the premium iPhone model could get, say, a ""+"" variant of that   chip (i.e. A11+, A12+, etc.)Apple wouldn't need to go crazy in necessarily building an   all-new chip just for the premium iPhone (though there might be a   compelling case for that), but what it could do is be more   aggressive about picking the very best A-series processors that   roll off the line and run them at higher speeds than what the   ""standard"" A-series chips run at to deliver better   performance.A slightly faster chip by itself likely isn't going to   convince many to go with a premium iPhone if they had no   intention of doing so anyway, but such a marketing point could   tip the scales if a customer is trying to figure out if the   better, higher-priced model is really the way to go.Better displaysToday, Apple already differentiates its iPhone models by   display quality -- the Plus models use sharper displays than   their standard counterparts. And, of course, Apple seems to be   readying to segment by display technology even further in the   coming product cycle (i.e. OLED for the premium model, LCDs for   the standard models).Apple should continue to do that going forward. Even once the   mainstream iPhone models have gotten their eventual OLED   upgrades, Apple can still differentiate its premium iPhone with   other display enhancements such as curved displays, higher   resolution displays, brighter displays, and so on.Foolish takeawayAt the end of the day, Apple's job is this: it needs to build   increasingly compelling products to drive iPhone upgrades (and   potentially share gains), and it needs to segment its product   line more aggressively to drive upsell and therefore maximize   average selling prices/profitability for a given level of unit   shipments.Apple appears well on its way to fully exploiting the   potential that exists here, and I think over the next couple of   years -- beginning with the coming iPhone cycle -- investors will   see an acceleration in these efforts that may ultimately enhance   shareholder value.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Can Pandora's New Subscription Service Compete with Spotify?;3/13/2017;"Just three months after the company announced initial plans, internet radio giant PandoraPis ready to debut its streaming music service. For $9.99 a month, Pandora Premium lets subscribers play and choose any song or album, as well as utilize new playlist creation features.Pandora has been around since 2000, and is known for its free, ad-supported radio service. While users cannot choose a specific song, they can pick artists and music genres, and give songs thumbs up or thumbs down to help narrow downs choices.For $4.99 a month, the company currently offers Pandora Plus, which lets subscribers listen to music without ads, skip more songs they dislike, and download songs for offline listening. Pandora Premium, however, could help the company compete with the likes of Spotify and Apple'sAAPLApple Music.""Every day tens of millions of people trust us to choose the exact right song for them. That's why they spend more time with Pandora than any other music service,"" said Pandora CEO and founder Tim Westergren in a statement. ""With Premium, we're leveraging our immense trove of data and everything we've learned about personalization to offer a listening experience that sets a new standard for what a music service should be.""With Pandora Premium, users will be able to download favorite songs, albums, playlists, and stations; they can begin a ""smart playlist,"" where users choose one or two songs, and Pandora fills out the rest of the playlist; and users have access to a ""My Thumps Up"" playlist, which includes every song they've thumbed up on Pandora.But can Pandora Premium successfully compete with Spotify?To be blunt, probably not. Spotify is, without a doubt, the leader in the streaming music industry despite its laundry list of controversies and profit problems. It has 100 million monthly active users, with 50 million paying for its Premium service. Pandora Premium features a crisp and easy-to-use platform, but isvery similarto what is already available to users who have Spotify or Apple Music.Current Spotify or Apple Music users will likely pass on the opportunity to switch over, but some may stop for a second look. Pandora has about 80 million current users-4.39 million of whom are already paying for Pandora Plus-and the company stands to benefit from transitioning its current users, or listeners new to the streaming music world.Current Pandora Plus subscribers will get six months of Premium for free, and the service will be available on iOS and Android phones, Apple CarPlay, Andriod Auto, and Google Chromecast starting his week.Pandora will send out invitations to select current users on Wednesday, March 15, with options for all users to upgrade in coming weeks.

Why Japanese Beer Stocks Could Be the Next Big Play of 2017;3/13/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsCall it the silent arrow of Abenomics, the series of economic plans proposed by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's administration. Inspired by an ancient tax code from the 19th century, Japanese beer is an absolute enigma from a legal perspective. Rather than impose a fairly simpleexcise taxon alcoholic beverages, Japanese beer has agradation policy. This has prevented many of the nation's beer stocks from truly reaching their potential.makeArticleAd();Source:Moyan Brenn via FlickrBreweries in Japan are regulated by malt content - the greater the malt, the more taxes you pay.If you thought that was weird, hold on - it gets worse! Real Japanese beer is labeled at the grocery markets as such: beer. But for those that want to avoid the onerous taxation of standard malt beverages, breweries can produce beer knockoffs, or derisively known as ""happoshu."" These beverages integrate peas, corn, or soybeans, essentially anything undesirable to drop the malt content.In fact, the ""Big Four"" of Japanese beer stocks -Asahi Group Holdings Ltd(OTCMKTS:ASBRF),Kirin Holdings Co Ltd(ADR)(OTCMKTS:KNBWY),Suntory Beverage & Food Ltd(OTCMKTS:STBFY) andSapporo Holdings NPV(OTCMKTS:SOOBF) - have an unwritten policy of flooding the market with happoshu. This way, they can still sell their alcoholic beverages while getting underneath the taxation threshold.Japanese Beer Stocks Versus the GovernmentThe current iteration of Japanese beer laws dates back to 1953, according toJapan Inc. Since then, two revisions were introduced - one in 1962, and one in 1989. The latter year was the most burdensome for the country's beer stocks, ironic because it was the pinnacle of the Nikkei 225 index.7 Cheap Dividend Stocks to Buy NowAt that time, several goods saw their tax liabilities reduced. Unfortunately for Japanese beer stocks, their brew was not affected. Deciding not to take the disparity lightly, STBFY was the first among the beer stocks tointroduce happoshuin 1994. Shortly thereafter, ASBRF, KNBWY and SOOBF followed suit with their own variants of cheap beer.What was a creative, but literally distasteful way, of getting around Japan's archaic alcohol laws was a short-lived victory. The suits in Tokyo caught on to the scheme, and began adjusting their malt threshold lower. In response, Japanese beer stocks became creative in their concoctions. The back and forth provided jobs for research and development teams, but was a nightmare for anyone who enjoys a cold one.Inarguably, though, Japan's craft brewery industry absorbed the most pain. Because craft beer containsexotic ingredients, the government often classifies them as happoshu. That wouldn't be a problem except for one thing - craft beer is expensive to make. But since they're labeled as happoshu, domestic powerhouse STBFY overwhelms them. After all, why pay more for cheap beer?For independent Japanese beer companies, the choices are limited. Domestically, the term happoshu has a negative connotation. Internationally, they would get clobbered by the mainstay beer stocks ASBRF, KNBWY, and SOOBF.Beer Stocks Critical for AbenomicsFortunately, change is on the horizon. According toBloomberg, the ""Finance Ministry, in an effort to boost the competitiveness of Japanese beers in the international market, will change the tax rates for beer and the substitutes starting in 2020, continuing through 2026. In 2018 it will expand the list of ingredients allowed inside the can. Leveling the taxes and removing the happoshu stigma could mean fast growth for the nation's craft brewers.""With smaller beer stocks able to compete in a more transparent environment, Japan can boost its regional economies.This falls right into the core principle of Abenomics - revitalize Japan through removing its shackles. In recent years, this translated into a national dialogue of women in the workplace and attracting immigration. Of course, as a country steeped in tradition, some of the arrows of Abenomics are more palatable than others.Should Apple Inc. Cut Its Dividend? (AAPL)The best part about Japanese beer stocks is that no one is going to turn down a cold one. Even the worst ideas sound great after alcohol consumption. But in all seriousness, the revamped tax codes make so much sense. Bloomberg further notes that domestic ""shipments of all beer have declined for 12 straight years, according to the Brewers Association of Japan""; giving craft breweries a reason to exist is an important and necessary step.New Policy a Welcome ChangeThe policy shift isn't just favorable for independent beer stocks. The majors are welcoming this transition with open arms. KNBWY CEO Yoshinori Isozaki bluntly stated that ""Too much attention has been given to winning market share through price wars, and we have left behind what is most important - the customer.""ASBRF and SOOBF have issued similar complaints for years. The average tax on Japanese beer is 800% higher than American beer, and 1,800% more expensive than its German counterpart. Antiquated laws were killing Japanese beer stocks from the inside out. But with the changing political tide, major brewers like STBFY arereinvesting in premiumbeverages.So far, this dynamic has occurred relatively quietly, and understandably so. Japan of today isn't the Japan of the 1980s. Nevertheless, the new Japanese beer policy is one of the most dramatic changes in the nation's retail distribution. As a result, don't be surprised to find that Japanese beer stocks will remain silent no longer!As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 Monthly Dividend Stocks to Buy to Pay the Bills8 Energy Stocks in Peril as Crude Oil Breaks DownThe postWhy Japanese Beer Stocks Could Be the Next Big Play of 2017appeared first onInvestorPlace."
Apple Inc. Building Graphics Chip Team in the U.K.;3/13/2017;"It's no secret at this point thatApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is building its own graphics processors. In fact,   not only is Apple working on its own graphics processors, but   microprocessor expert David Kanterrevealedlast year that Apple has been employing its own graphics   processors inside of its A-series processors since the launch of   its A8 system-on-a-chip in the fall of 2014.Based on where many of the graphics-oriented Apple employees   that I see onLinkedInappear to be located, the company apparently has a graphics   processor design site in Orlando, FL.Image source: Apple.makeArticleAd();While perusing LinkedIn, I noticed that one of my connections   began advertising the fact that Apple is looking to fill   positions in its U.K.-based ""Apple Hardware Design Center.""Unsurprisingly, as you can see in the screenshot below, all   the positions that came up were graphics related:Image source: LinkedIn.Further, when I clicked on one of the positions (""Graphics   Modeling Engineer""), the job description says ""This is a career   defining opportunity to get in at the ground floor as we build   our UK Design Centre.""It's clear that the company is building a graphics processor   design team in the U.K. So, why is the company doing that?Increasing the pace of innovationWhat I suspect Apple is doing is building a parallel graphics   processor team to the one(s) that it already has in place. If   that hypothesis is correct, it'll mean that the company will gain   the ability to work on multiple graphics processors in a ""leap   frogging"" fashion.That is, Team 1 works on the graphics processor that'll be   used in some iPhone (let's call it iPhone x) while Team 2 works   in parallel on the graphics processor that will be used in the   follow-on iPhone, iPhone x+1. Then, once Team 1 finishes its work   on the graphics processor for iPhone x, it begins working on the   graphics processor for iPhone x+2.Under such a development methodology -- and it is a common one   in the chip industry -- a company can increase the pace and the   scope of the innovation that it can bring with each new   design.Why is Apple doubling-down on graphics?Apple CEO Tim Cook is on record stating that he believes that   augmented reality will be ahuge deal. To fully capitalize on the opportunities in both virtual   reality and augmented reality, companies are likely going to need   to have significant expertise when it comes to efficient,   high-performance graphics processors.In other words, it's an intellectual property that could be   very important for the future of the iPhone and mobile devices in   general.Beyond the iPhone, though, Apple surely wants to have   best-in-class graphics to enable the kinds of workloads and   experiences that it can deliver through its iPad (which it is   positioning as a notebook/PC replacement) as well as through its   Apple TV products (better graphics could help Apple TV inch   closer to becoming a game console competitor).Apple appears to recognize the importance of having excellent   graphics technologies in-house and I think what we are seeing is   Apple simply making financial bets commensurate with that   viewpoint.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Should Apple Inc. Cut Its Dividend? (AAPL);3/13/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) is the world's largest technology company, and it once was one of the best growth stocks on the market. It has shifted gears, though, and now Apple stock is one of the more promising dividend growth plays on the market.makeArticleAd();Source:FlickrAAPL paid its first dividend - at least since 1995 - on Aug. 16, 2012. It paid investors 38.9 cents per share on a split-adjusted basis.The payout has been hiked four times since, and currently sits at 57 cents per share. That's a compound annual growth rate of 10%, with 2017's dividend increase expected to be similar. After all, AAPL stock only has a payout ratio of 27% of its trailing earnings and a 1.6% yield.When you look at shareholder yield - dividends plus buybacks - Apple's record is even more impressive. The company spent $12.2 billion on dividends and a whopping $29.2 billion on share repurchases in 2016. That works out to a shareholder yield of 5.6%.AAPL is returning capital at a blistering pace.10 Monthly Dividend Stocks to Buy to Pay the BillsHowever, while most shareholders are ecstatic with the dividend on Apple stock, allow me to present an alternate argument:Apple should cut its payout … and maybe even eliminate it altogether.Apple, Meet AlphabetLet's take a minute to compare Apple to one of its peers,Alphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL).Alphabet's dividend policy is pretty clear. It saidin its 2016 10-K filing, ""We have never declared or paid any cash dividend on our common or capital stock. We intend to retain any future earnings and do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.""Alphabet can easily afford a dividend, too. It made $19.5 billion in 2016, or $28.32 per share.The reasoning behind this is simple. Alphabet is aggressively investing in the kinds of projects that can really boost its top line. It has been working on a self-driving car since 2009. It invested more than$6 billion on Google Fiber. Alphabet also teamed up withFidelitytoinvest $1 billion inSpaceX.In total, Alphabet spent $13.9 billion on research and development in 2016, as well as $10.2 billion on capital expenditures.Apple is still investing in the future, but not as aggressively as Alphabet. AAPL spent $10 billion on research and development and $13.5 billion on capital expenditures in 2016, despite making a net profit of $45.7 billion.In other words, Alphabet reinvested $24.1 billion back into its business in 2016 while earning $19.5 billion. Apple reinvested $23.5 billion while earning $45.7 billion. AAPL barely reinvested half of its earnings back into its business.AAPL Needs to Make Some AcquisitionsApple does have some exciting plans. One of the tech world's worst-kept secrets is Apple's plans to somehow be a part of thecar of the future. It has also been working in thevirtual reality space, and many expect big improvements toApple TV. These investments are great. But I don't think they'll be enough to usher in a new era of growth.It's time for Apple to go shopping.Apple could easily take the $41 billion it gave back to shareholders in 2016 and use it to make a huge splash.Say Apple agreed to buyNetflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX) at a 50% premium to today's price - so, roughly $91 billion. AAPL could pay off the deal in just a few years from its existing cash flow alone, and would own a company that has doubled revenues in the last three years.Intel Corporation (INTC) Buys Mobileye NV (MBLY) to Win the Auto MarketApple's main growth driver today is service revenue. In its most recent quarter, AAPL grew its top line 3% on a quarter-over-quarter basis.It grew services revenue by 18%. Acquiring Netflix would would not only supercharge that division, it would give Apple access to Netflix's whole library of content.The Bottom Line on Apple StockThere's a reason why AAPL trades at the same multiple as the rest of the market. Investors assume - rightfully so - that it is a mature company with no immediate growth prospects. If Apple slashed its dividend and announced it was using that money for acquisitions, investors would sit up and take notice.There's no guarantee such sentiment would send Apple stock soaring right away. In fact, it'd be easy to see the market taking the short-term view that something is amiss, and selling AAPL as a result.But if executed right, such a strategy would make Apple shareholders richer in the long run.As of this writing, Nelson Smith did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

The OLED   display itself should enable much improved image quality (if   Apple can make this display HDR-capable, then that'd be an even   bigger bonus), and the form factor is said to include a   stainless-steel frame as well as a higher screen-to-body ratio   than the current iPhone models do.The display and form factor changes, coupled with what are   sure to be solid improvements in camera capabilities, internal   specifications, and even the rumored 3D sensing capabilities, are   probably going to be enough to trigger a so-called iPhone ""super   cycle"" -- at least if such a cyclecanstill occur these days.If Apple can ship the devices with a curved OLED display,   that'd be nice, but this is unlikely to make or break the   commercial success of the device.Saving curved displays for next time?Interestingly, a report from The Bell (via MacRumors) claims   that Apple aims to switch over completely to OLED-based displays   for its iPhone product line by 2019.I suspect that once Apple introduces this rumored premium   iPhone in its product stack, it is going to want to continue to   have products at that price point in future generations even as   technologies originally introduced at that premium price point   trickle down into the more mainstream models.Image source: Apple.What Apple could do, then, is ""save"" the curved display for   the premium iPhone that it introduces next year, while   transitioning its mainstream iPhone products to flat OLED   displays. That way, Apple improves the appeal of its products   across its product stack while keeping the best technological   goodies in the most expensive products.An exciting product cycle ahead for AppleThe main point is this: Apple appears to have an exciting   product cycle ahead of it as it introduces the premium OLED   iPhone alongside what are expected to be refreshed versions of   the current iPhone 7/7 Plus designs.What remains an open question, though, is how Apple intends to   maintain/grow iPhone demand following the potentially upcoming   ""super cycle.""Apple may be able to further stimulate demand by bringing flat   OLED displays to the ""standard"" price points while introducing 3D   curved displays in the next-generation premium model, but without   a significant delta in features/functionality between the   ""premium"" model and the ""standard"" models, Apple might risk   seeing a mix down in its product shipments in the following   cycle.That said, I have some thoughts on how Apple can counter that   -- but that's a topic that I'm saving for my next Apple-related   column.

Each week, several of the company's analysts and editors publish exclusive podcasts that highlight some of the financial world's top stories and provide investors with a variety of strategies based on Zacks' proven stock-picking methods.Friday Finish Line with Ryan McQueeney and Maddy   JohnsonOnEpisode #39of the Zacks Friday Finish Line Podcast, Content Writer Ryan McQueeney and Editor Maddy Johnson take on this week's biggest stories, including the current state of the IPO market in the wake of Snap's historic debut.Before that, the hosts touched on the recent volatility in the oil market, which has caused some to question whether OPEC will continue its production cuts; Facebook'sFBnew Snapchat clone, Messenger Day; and the federal investigation surrounding CaterpillarCAT.Finally, Maddy and Ryan chatted about the IPO market in the wake of Snap Inc.'sSNAPmassive debut. Investors are thirsty for more initial public offerings, and there might just be a few more this year. For example, the hosts discussed Spotify and Airbnb, which could be IPO candidates soon.In the meantime, companies like J. JillJILLand Canada Goose are choosing to go public right now. Maddy and Ryan also discussed why these brands are choosing IPOs and what they can both do to continue growing.The Dutram Report with Eric DutramOnEpisode #13of The Dutram Report, Eric Dutram is joined by Michael Willis, the lead portfolio manager of INDEX Funds. His key product, the Index Funds S&P 500 Equal WeightINDEX, takes the same S&P 500 stocks, but invests in them equally.In the actual S&P 500, AppleAAPLaccounts for about 4% of the total, while MicrosoftMSFTmakes up about 2.5% of the weighted index. This fund covers the same companies, but each one takes up about 0.2% of the total.Together, Eric and Michael discussed how this small change can actually make a big difference to overall returns.

The Next iPhone Could Be a Big Catalyst for These Apple Suppliers;3/13/2017;"Rumor has itApple's(NASDAQ: AAPL)  10th anniversary edition iPhone, expected   this year, is going to be groundbreaking. From its having a glass   body to sporting more memory to having an edge-to-edge OLED   display, the rumors around the next iPhone are aplenty. One rumor   that seems to have gained some credibility of late is the   inclusion of wireless charging in Apple's next flagship   model.JPMorgananalyst Harlan Sur believes that at least one of Apple's iPhones   this year will sport customized wireless charging. Sur's forecast   is in agreement with what other analysts have been saying.   Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities expects that all the iPhones Apple   releases this year will have the wireless-charging feature.Whether wireless charging will be part of the next iPhone and   whether that would boost sales is unknown. But it's not just   Apple fans who will be watching developments closely.Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO)  andDialog Semiconductor(NASDAQOTH: DLGNF) also stand to benefit from wireless charging   in iPhones.makeArticleAd();Broadcom can make big money from Apple's wireless   chargingSur's research note says that Apple and Broadcom have been   working on wireless-charging technology for a couple of   years. Apple's partnership with Broadcom does not come as a   surprise: The latter company was one of the first movers in this   space.Image source: Broadcom.Around three years back, Broadcom launched a multistandard   wireless system-on-a-chip (SoC) -- the BCM59350 wireless-charging   power management unit -- for use in smartphones. Broadcom's   product was compatible with all of the wireless-charging   standards -- including the Wireless Power Consortium's -- so that   it can be used by different smartphone OEMs.At that time, Broadcom had said that it was sampling the power   management unit with ""select customers,"" but there has been no   update on the chip since. This leaves open the possibility of   Apple entering into an exclusivity arrangement with Broadcom; the   smartphone giant has been known in the past toforce its suppliersinto such deals.Additionally, CNBC reports that Apple has entered the Wireless   Power Consortium, which sets one of the standards that Broadcom's   chip supports. Moreover, Sure also said that the rumored glass   case on the back of the upcoming iPhone will support wireless   charging, since it is prone to less interference than a metal   case.The likelihood of Apple using Broadcom's chips to enable   wireless charging is definitely there. If this  turns out to   be the case, Sur said, Broadcom's iPhone revenue opportunity   from wireless charging could be worth $500 million to $600   million. But Broadcom might not be alone in the race for Apple's   wireless-charging riches.This Apple supplier could also be in the frayDialog Semiconductor relies heavily on Apple for revenue. The   U.K.-based company reportedly gets around 75% of its revenue from   Apple by supplying power management integrated circuits.In December 2016, Dialog made a $10 million investment inEnergous(NASDAQ: WATT) , which has developed a proprietary long-distance   wireless-charging technology known as WattUp. This technology can   charge smartphones from a distance of up to 15 feet.Image source: Energous.This February, the two companies launched a small RF (radio   frequency) power circuit that's cheaper than the previous   generation and occupies less space. The companies have already   started sampling this chip to customers, which means that   Broadcom might not be the lone contender for any Apple   wireless-charging content.Additionally, Energous' technology is not new to Apple. As   reported by VentureBeat, Energous' products and reference designs   have already undergone compliance testing at Apple, which means   that the latter company could be considering its technology for   wireless charging. What's more, Energous CEO Steve Rizzone   dropped a major hint that his company's wireless-charging tech   could be coming to mainstream devices later this year.The Vergequoted him as talking about a partnership with ""one of   the largest consumer electronics companies in the world. I cannot   tell you who it is, but I can virtual guarantee that you have   products from this company on your person, sitting on your desk,   or at home.""Investors in Dialog and Broadcom will be watching closely as   we get closer to having the next iPhone go on sale.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

How Will a Supplier's Factory Fire Affect Apple Inc.?;3/13/2017;"According to analysts with research firm BlueFin Research   Partners (by way ofBarron's), a ""small fire"" broke out in the basement of the clean room in   ST Microelectronics' manufacturing plant, commonly referred to in   the chip industry as a fab, short for ""fabrication plant,"" in   Crolles, France.""This fab is the sole manufacturing facility for 3D sensors""   at ST Microelectronics, the analysts explain, adding that this   ""incident has currently shut down the facility"" and that their   research ""indicates [that] it could take several weeks to   requalify the fab and resume production.""Why is this news? Because it's believed thatST Microelectronics(NYSE: STM) will be providing 3D image sensors toApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) for its upcoming premium iPhone.makeArticleAd();Image source: Apple.To make matters worse, the analysts say these 3D sensors have   a ""long production cycle time"" and ""relatively low yield   rate."" BlueFin says these factors ""will make it difficult to   get back on their production schedule target with each day that   the fab is incapacitated.""Let's go over what the implications to Apple's upcoming   premium iPhone could be.Understanding the problemIt's important to understand that in the chip industry, it   takes a long time to go from a blank silicon wafer to a fully   processed one with usable chips on it. The time it takes for the   wafer to go through the manufacturing process is called the   ""cycle time.""Cycle time is typically about three months, give or take,   depending on several factors. According to BlueFin, ST Micro's 3D   sensors have a ""long production cycle time,"" so it might take   more like four months for these 3D sensors to be   manufactured.If the fab is taken offline for a significant amount of time,   that pushes out the entire chip production schedule. What this   ultimately could mean, then, is that Apple won't be able to build   as many iPhones as it had originally planned to ahead of the   launch.What is Apple to do?The BlueFin analysts say they ""believe it is likely that   [Apple] and [ST Micro] are assessing the impact to the schedule   and are working on a recovery plan."" Additionally, they say they   ""have yet to see any corresponding push out of the iPhone 8/X   builds with the rest of the supply chain.""To be blunt, I could see Apple simply going along with its   product launches as expected and simply having customers order   the phones, even if it means that those customers must wait   several weeks for their devices to come in.You may recall that Apple facedmanufacturing yieldissues on its iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus devices in jet black. It   took a while before everyone's orders were fulfilled, but people   got their orders in, they waited, and they eventually got   them.And, of course, Apple reached supply/demand balance for all   its iPhone models by January.Don't panicDesigning and building innovative devices with a whole host of   new and possibly difficult-to-manufacture components isn't easy,   and companies that try to stay at the forefront of device   innovation are necessarily going to face challenges in bringing   new products to market.That's just the reality of the situation, and investors need   to get comfortable with that.The fire at ST Micro's fab is unfortunate, and it's a headache   that both Apple and ST Micro could have gone without, but I have   confidence that the experienced professionals at both companies   will do their best to contain the situation and launch the new   iPhones as soon as practicable.10 stocks we like better than STMicroelectronicsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Better Buy: Qualcomm Inc. vs. Intel Corporation;3/13/2017;"Big changes are afoot for bothQualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM) andIntel(NASDAQ: INTC) . Qualcomm has been making significant strides in   its efforts to expand its product suite beyond its dominant   smartphone leadership position. Artificial intelligence, the   Internet of Things (IoT), and ""smart"" devices for the home and   car are a few up-and-coming markets on Qualcomm's radar.Meanwhile, CEO Brian Krzanich has Intel keenly focused on its   own IoT, smart devices, and cloud-based data center ambitions.   Though Intel's transformation is showing signs of life, its stock   price has languished much of the last year.So far in 2017, Intel shares are down 1%, while Qualcomm stock   has nosedived 11%. The two companies promise both growth and   income, and have the potential to be sound value plays. Which one   is the better buy? Let's take a look.makeArticleAd();Snapdragon processor. Image source: Qualcomm.The Qualcomm caseRecent discussions involving Qualcomm involve ongoing legal   battles and the possible ramifications on its all-important   licensing revenue. There's also the proposed $47 billion deal for   Netherlands-basedNXP Semiconductors(NASDAQ: NXPI) , which may not be quite the slam dunk Qualcomm   had hoped for.Qualcomm is facing multiple lawsuits brought by longtime   customerApple, which is alleging unfair licensing fees for its patented   technologies. South Korea's Fair Trade Commission levied a record   $898 million fine against Qualcomm for much the same reason.   Legal back-and-forth in the tech sector is nothing new, but even   the hint that Qualcomm's licensing revenue could be in jeopardy   has had investors running for the hills.Last quarter's 4% increase in total revenue to $6 billion was   driven by Qualcomm's impressive 13% jump in licensing sales to   $1.81 billion. Licensing is hands-down Qualcomm's leading profit   generator. Earnings before taxes in the segment tallied an   astounding $1.53 billion in fiscal 2017's first quarter, equal to   85% of the unit's revenue. By contrast, Qualcomm's mobile access   division generated $4.1 billion in quarterly sales, but just 18%,   or $724 million, of that total were earnings before taxes.As for NXP, Qualcomm has recently extended its ""final"" offer   once again in an attempt to get the deal closed. CEO Steve   Mollenkopf cited the pending NXP acquisition as a key element in   Qualcomm's transition to IoT, smart cars, and data security   markets. If the NXP transaction falls through, investors can   expect more near-term pressure on Qualcomm's stock price.Intel processor. Image source: Intel.The Intel caseBased on its stock price, it's easy to forget Intel is coming   off a record-breaking quarter and year. Since the company   announced its record $16.4 billion in sales last quarter and   $59.4 billion in annual revenue, Intel stock is down nearly 5%.   Investors' seemingly blase attitude toward Intel translates to it   being one of the best values in its sector.At just 12 times forward earnings, Intel stock is woefully   undervalued, which is great news for investors. The even-better   news is that Intel set its revenue records thanks to delivering   on its key growth areas. While a stronger-than-expected PC market   helped push client computing sales up 2%, to $32.9 billion, in   2016, it was data center, IoT, and security results that put   Intel over the top.Cloud data centers generated $17.2 billion in revenue last   year, up 8% from 2015. Intel followed that up with a 15% jump in   IoT sales, to $2.6 billion, and $2.2 billion in security revenue,   good for a 9% improvement. The three units combined continue to   make up an increasingly larger piece of Intel's revenue, which   should help ease long-standing fears that the company is overly   reliant on PCs.Which is the better buy?As Krzanich put it recently, Intel is shifting ""from a server   and CPU company to a data center company,"" a transition that   investors will eventually buy into. Qualcomm's recent legal   and acquisition hiccups will likely sort themselves out before   long, bringing investors back into the fold.Priced at just 12 times future earnings, Qualcomm offers a   great deal of upside -- along with a 3.95% dividend yield -- for   investors willing to ride out the near-term storms. For the   more risk-averse, Intel's 2.9% dividend and depressed stock price   offer a relatively stable long-term alternative to Qualcomm. The   better buy depends in part on your investing temperament.10 stocks we like better than QualcommWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Why Apple Should Be Scared of This Company;3/12/2017;"Image source: Getty Images.Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) andSamsung's(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) reign at the top of the smartphone market is   under threat. Slowly but steadily, Chinese telecom giant Huawei   has been spreading its wings across key global markets, in a bid   to displace Apple and Samsung from the top of the smartphone   heap.makeArticleAd();Huawei's ambition of becoming the second-largest smartphone   company in the world received a shot in the arm in 2016, as its   smartphone sales increased close to 27% from the year before. In   stark contrast, both Apple's and Samsung's shipments fell 4.3%   over the same period, according toGartner. The strong growth in shipments gave Huawei 8.9% of the   smartphone market in 2016 compared to 7.3% a year ago.By comparison, the market shares of both Apple and Samsung   took a beating. The Cupertino-based smartphone giant's share of   the market fell by 1.5 percentage points to 14.4%, while   Samsung's market share fell by two percentage points to 20.5%.   Huawei, however, has managed to consistently increase its   smartphone shipments, leading to market-share gains:Data sources: Strategy Analytics and Counterpoint Technology     Market Research. Chart by author.Having already occupied the third place in the smartphone   race, the Chinese vendor will now go all out to achieve its lofty   ambitions. In November 2016, the chief executive of Huawei's   consumer business group told Reuters that it wants to become the   second-largest smartphone company in two years. But will it be   able to meet this aggressive target?China and India will be tailwinds for HuaweiThe Chinese company has been seeking growth in its home   market. Last year, Huawei shipped 76.6 million phones in China   and sat in the second place with a market share of 16.4%.   Meanwhile, Apple's Chinese shipments dropped an alarming 23% to   44.9 million units, giving it a single-digit market share of just   9.6%.This means that Huawei has opened a huge gap over Apple in   China, as its smartphone shipments there are up almost 22% in   2016. China will be the key to Huawei's global smartphone   dominance, since it is the world's biggest smartphone market and   accounted for 21% of global shipments last year.What's more, the growing adoption of LTE connections in China   means that smartphone demand in the country will remain strong.   GSMA Intelligence forecasts that China will have 1 billion   4G connections by 2020, compared to 762 million at the end of   2016. The increased adoption of 4G means that customers will need   toupgrade to smartphonesfrom feature phones as they move away from legacy technologies   such as 2G and 3G.On the other hand, Huawei is also looking to make inroads into   the Indian market. Last year, it said that it aims to have 10% of   the Indian smartphone market by the end of 2017. In fact,   Huawei's Indian consumer operations reports directly to the   Chinese headquarters, showing the company recognizes the   importance of this market.This is not surprising as annual smartphone sales in India are   expected to top 200 million units in 2020 (rising from 102   million units last year), making it the world's second-largest   market. If Huawei manages to carve out a 10% share for itself in   India, it can add 20 million units in smartphone sales.This looks like an uphill task since it had just 0.5% of the   Indian market in the first half of 2016. But in September 2016,   Huawei began its smartphone manufacturing operations in India,   and it plans to manufacture 3 million units by the end of 2017.   If it is able to convert all these units into sales this year,   the company's Indian market share will gain respectability.By comparison, Apple is yet to get its manufacturing   operations in India into full swing. Though its manufacturing   partner Wistron has set up a plant in the southern part of the   country, it will only produce around 300,000 to 400,000 units of   the iPhone SE initially. This is a far cry from Huawei's   manufacturing capacity.The secret behind Huawei's growthHuawei has a smart formula to win over customers in big   smartphone markets -- offline sales. In China, Huawei plans to   set up 1,000 stores across all counties, apart from striking   partnerships with distributors and retailers. It also plans to   deploy 460 service stores in 45 nations.Meanwhile, Huawei has partnered with more than 50,000 retail   outlets in India and is going to set up more than 200 service   centers. The company's offline-store strategy for emerging   markets is a smart one, allowing it to gain more eyeballs and   eventually increase sales.In fact, offline sales in markets such as India have been the   key to the success of Chinese smartphone companies, since   customers have been able to touch and feel their phones before   buying. And, just 35% of the Indian population had access to the   internet last year, which could be another reason that Huawei has   been busy opening retail outlets in smaller cities.A similar scenario is unfolding in China, where offline   smartphone sales are gaining momentum. The growing shift toward   offline smartphone sales has encouraged Huawei to drastically   ramp up its company-owned stores.Huawei had bumped its global store count by 116% to 35,000   toward the end of May 2016. The company has further strengthened   its retail presence as it planned to open another 15,000 stores   in 2016 itself. Around half of its stores are on the Chinese   mainland and across the rest of Asia, with the next-largest   fraction in Europe.By comparison, Apple has 491 stores spread across the globe,   and over half of them are in the U.S. What's more, its store   presence in markets such as India and China is negligible   compared to Huawei's. Apple reportedly had 40 stores in China by   the end of June 2016, when Huawei had over 11,000 stores on the   mainland. On the other hand, Apple's plans to open stores in   India have been slowed by regulations, though it might open up   three of them this year.Huawei's strong retail presence is complemented by the   company's strategy of offering both budget and premium   smartphones. The Honor 5C, which some reviewers count among the   top budget phones, costs less than $170 in India at current   exchange rates, placing it way below the global-average   smartphone price of $256.In fact, Huawei also sells feature phones in emerging markets   that cost less than $100. These budget phones help bring   customers to its stores and improve brand awareness. The company   is now gradually moving into the higher segment of the market by   launching more mid-range and premium phones, which should   eventually improve the average selling prices of its phones.Image source: Huawei.The takeawayA strong retail presence and an extensive product portfolio   that covers all segments of the smartphone market have been the   catalysts behind Huawei's growth. In fact, the company's   two-pronged strategy has put it in the limelight, as the value of   its brand grew 28% in 2016 on the back of high-end devices and   marketing campaigns.Apple and Samsung, therefore, have a fierce competitor that   looks capable of breaking into the top two in the smartphone   market.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Voice: The Next Computing Empire;3/11/2017;"This article is the first in a two-part series aimed at     exploring the rapidly developing state of voice computing from     the investor's perspective. In Part I, I discuss why it's now     increasingly clear that the human voice will become society's     next major computing interface, and why it will continue     proliferating through our homes and businesses. In Part II,     I'll dive deeper into the new and emerging business models. In     Part II, I'll discuss the various players involved in the race     to commercialize the technology -- those best-positioned to     profit today, those positioning themselves to thrive tomorrow,     and those dropping the ball entirely. I'll also dive deeper     into the fascinating business models voice computing will soon     enable, and how those models will evolve as the technology     continues to improve.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();For nearly 40 years, we've seen the computer evolve into an   indispensable accessory of Western society driven by three   powerful technologies that defined their eras and played a   monumental role for investors along the way.The personal computer gave many of us our first glimpse at the   digital world, normalizing the idea that such machines have a   place in our homes and everyday lives. The internet tapped us   into that world, offering us endless floods of information,   entertainment, and commerce around which we willingly began   shaping our civilization. And then the smartphone encouraged us   to take that digital world everywhere we go, leaving nothing but   a few taps on a touchscreen between us, our computers, and   constant immersion.Now, a fourth technology -- voice computing--is removing that last barrier.Reimagining the roles computers playImagine driving down the highway, coming home from work, and     without taking your hands off the wheel or hitting any buttons,     asking your car to turn up the heat in your house, preheat the     oven for dinner, and play your favorite album, all in the same     breath. Picture negotiating with a street vendor in Beijing,     having your phone translate the entire conversation between     Mandarin and English out loud, so you can haggle in real time.     Or how about a stuffed animal that can tell your daughter     interactive stories every night before bed, reshaping the     adventure at every twist and turn based on her responses and     reactions.These aren't hypothetical scenarios -- they're happening     right now.The human voice is well on its way to becoming the next     major medium we use to interact with computers, and as we'll     explore in this two-part series,voicecomputingis the burgeoning field of technology making it possible.     Already spanning multiple consumer and enterprise ventures     (think call center routing, digital dictation, or the virtual     assistants on smartphones), the industry's ultimate aim is     enabling people to carry on hands-free, conversational-style     interactions with computers.It's an ambitious prospect capable of significantly     expanding the roles computers play in our everyday lives, but     it's also one that appears inevitable when considering the     trajectory computers have taken, without fail, since their     introduction, evolving in shape and form around contemporary     technology to solve unmet needs.Image Source: Getty ImagesAnd yet voice computing's evolution is different. Unlike any     form of computing to come before it, the technology bypasses     the physical realm, allowing users to query the internet,     manage their surroundings, and connect to third-party services     without ever having to touch a physical device -- all in the     time it takes to form a sentence.If that sounds unnecessary, then consider just how limitless     the applications could be. From the surgeon who needs to     rapidly adjust the conditions of her operating room     mid-procedure, to the disabled veteran who simply hopes to     access the appliances in his home. The sheer number of everyday     applications for such a technology has prompted Grand View     Research to project the global market for voice recognition     technology will reach $128 billion annually by 2024, an     estimate that may undershoot the overall economic opportunity     at play considering the potential verticals include healthcare,     defense, entertainment, consumer goods, and more (I'll discuss     these in more detail in Part II).There is one thing we can be certain of, however. Voice     computing is extremely likely to transform the way we interact     with technology in society, but before that can happen, a     large-scale societal shift toward adopting the interface must     occur, a shift thatcannotoccur until several key hurdles are overcome.Understanding the challenges aheadTo analyze those obstacles, let's turn to the most       promising application of voice-driven technology today:       virtual digital assistants.Data Sources: Socratic Technologies, Vantiv, Statista.         Chart by AuthorThanks to the success of the iPhone andApple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) other devices, Siri is currently the most       wildly used virtual assistant in the United States, but until       recently, it's also perfectly exemplified what's holding       voice computing back. To put it simply, speaking with Siri       can often feel more like a novelty than a time-saver, a       sentiment shared not just among Apple users, but most       smartphone owners with access to similar voice computing       technology.It's a problem we can break down into three fundamental       hurdles.The first is that users must often resort to awkward       combinations of hyper-specific phrasing and hurried       robo-speak to have their speech accurately recognized. Andrew       Ng, chief scientist atBaidu(NASDAQ: BIDU) and one the most respected names in the field,       perhaps put it best in 2015 when he noted, ""Speech       recognition, depending on the circumstances, is say 95 per       cent accurate. So maybe it gets one word in 20 wrong. That's       really annoying if it gets one in 20 wrong and you probably       don't want to use it very often. That's probably where speech       recognition is today.""The second hurdle is that even when our speech iscorrectlyrecognized, there still remains a strong chance it will bemisinterpretedwhile undergoing natural language understanding, a process in       which the assistant attempts to comprehend what we want using       the sequence of words (and eventually, the tone, pace, and       inflection) we give. And even if that speech is correctly       understood, an assistant may still simply be unable to solve       for the request due to technical constraints. Examples of       both cases can be seen in the screenshot below, along with a       sense of how frustrating the encounter can be.Image Source: Author's iPhoneEncounters like these make us feel as though we're wasting       our time trusting our phones to do what we could have done       ourselves with only a little more effort upfront. Over time,       they build up, eventually discouraging us from even tryingto       use our assistants for anything complex, instead relying on       them only for the most trivial of tasks, like setting alarms       or creating reminders.Thankfully, these first two hurdles are solvable with data,   third-party partnerships, and time, each of which the major   players in this space have been actively accruing for years.   Returning to our example, since Siri was introduced to the world   in 2011, virtual assistants have grown far more capable of   correctly interpreting requests thanks to advances in deep   learning, a thriving field of AI being utilized byAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) ,Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) , Baidu, and others to improve speech recognition,   natural language understanding, and other components of voice   computing at astounding rates. (Click herefor an outstanding story byThe New York Timeson Google's significant role in making this happen).Equally as important, decisions by Apple and its competitors   to open their platforms up to third-party services have made   today's voice-based assistants feel far more capable than in   years past. These decisions allow Siri, for example, to call you   a ride using your Uber account, or order a pizza through your   storedDomino'sinformation -- not unlike anactualsecretary would do.As the potential behind voice computing becomes increasingly   obvious in the coming months and years, we should expect more and   more third parties to hop on board, eventually expanding the   scope of what a partnership could entail (instead of ordering an   Uber, imagine ordering a plane ticket). One look at the rate of   growth for third-party commands available on Amazon's voice-based   assistant, Alexa, can tell us a lot.Data Source: Voicebot. Chart by AuthorWith time, these technical achievements and partnerships will   continue compounding, eventually making for a highly practical   voice computing experience. Even marginal improvements in the   technology will convince users to begin using voice as an   interface more frequently. In the same talk regarding the current   state of the voice industry, Ng went on to say, ""I think that as   speech recognition accuracy goes from say 95 per cent to 98, 99   to 99.9, all of us in the room will go from barely using it   today, to using it all the time."" He added, ""Most people   underestimate the difference between 95 and 99 per cent ... 99   per cent is a game changer.""Although we're not yet able to predict when the technology   will reach that point, if the recent pace of progress is any   indication -- since Ng's speech, Baidu has built a program   capable of dictating English three times faster, and with 20%   less errors, than human beings -- it won't be much longer.In the meantime, an arguably far more important hurdle stands   in the way. It's a problem shared by every other major computing   medium in use today, only voice is actually solving for it.An instantaneous computing experienceNo matter the medium, we've always interacted with computers   by issuing commands. In the 1950s, we meticulously punched those   commands into cards before feeding them into hulking machines.   Now, technology allows us to simply type, click, and,   increasingly, speak them and expect a result.Yet despite these advancements, today's mediums still subject   users to a unique set of delays, a sort of friction that   inherently slows down the process betweenthinkinga command and actually being able tocommunicatethat command to your devices. A decade ago, that friction most   likely entailed tracking down a PC with internet, using the mouse   to open a browser, using the keyboard to run a search, and then   sorting for the result. But today, for most Americans, it simply   means reaching into our pockets for our phone, scrolling with our   thumb, and tapping away.It's a process so effortless, the average American now checks   their phone an estimated 46 times per day. It's even become   fashionable to argue there's no longerenoughfriction separating society from our devices; that we'retooplugged in to the digital world.So when you consider that voice computing's primary advantage   iseliminatingfriction, it becomes tempting to dismiss the technology as a   solution to a trivial problem. What that argument critically   fails to consider, however, is that friction is about more than   simple convenience, and that any amount of friction, no matter   how small, fundamentally limits the dynamic between a user and   their computing medium in two ways.Let's take the smartphone for example.Image Source: PixabayThe seemingly trivial motions we make when reaching for our   phone still require us to be in immediate proximity of the   device. We have to walk over to kitchen counter if we left our   phone there; we have to remember it's on the counter even before   we can do that. Then, once we've reached our phone, we're   required to physically handle it, a process that generally   requires we have one hand free and able.That may not sound like much, but these limitations force our   computing experience to revolve around the location of our   device, as opposed to it revolving around us.They can create roadblocks for those with disabilities affecting   their vision or hands (or really, even those who just have sticky   hands, wet hands, or their hands full), those far away from their   device, and most importantly, those with an immediate computing   need.There's a reason speech is our most instinctual form of   communication.If we have a question, and if we know those around us can   answer that question, we don't pull out our phone and run a   search, we open our mouths and ask. We do that because it's   instantaneous. Now contrast that with having to locate your   phone, having to type in your password, having to navigate to an   app, having to tap, type, or speak your command. These behaviors   are not instinctual,but we put up with them because the people around us usually   don't have the answers, and because smartphones are our best   alternative.But they don't have to be.The rise of voiceIt's not obvious quite yet, but today's physically bound   mediums have left a large hole to fill and voice computing is   starting to fill it.Over the past two years, the technology has begun manifesting   itself in the form of always-on, always-listening devices able to   virtually bypass the friction inherent in today's major computing   mediums. Currently, these devices are best exemplified by   Amazon's line of Echo smart speakers, which employ far-field   voice recognition technology allowing users to command Alexa from   across multiple rooms and through various background noises at   any time simply by calling for it out loud.Image Source: Amazon.com.Put another way, for as little as $50, Amazon's Echo is giving   consumers their first glimpse at a frictionless computing   experience. Following its initial setup, there's no pressing   buttons, no looking around for the device, and no navigating   through screens to issue a command. When it works correctly (like   Siri, Alexa is still very much in its infancy and subject to   misinterpreting commands) it really does allow users to convert   their thoughts to a command in the time it takes to form a   sentence, capturing the essential promise of voice as a   medium.And if the early estimated adoption rate for the device is any   indication -- Amazon hasn't officially released sales   figures, but as of January 2016, Consumer Intelligence Research   Partners (CIRP) estimates a staggering 8.2 million Echos have   already been sold in the U.S. (a number that pales in comparison   to Morgan Stanley's estimates of over 11 million), suggesting the   device has achieved well over 5% household penetration -- early   demand for a seamless computing experience is strong, and will   likely grow stronger as capable competitors race to introduce   their own offerings (see Google's Home,Nvidia's(NASDAQ: NVDA) Spot, or Baidu's Little Fish), and as voice   recognition, natural language understanding, and third-party   support continue improving at rapid pace.Data Sources: VoiceLabs, CIRP, KPCB, InfoScout. *2017     figures are VoiceLab projections. Chart by AuthorTo be clear, these devices will never replace today's existing   computing mediums, but will rather augment them. While   screens will remain the preferred medium for our more detailed   and visual computing needs, voice will begin its ascent by taking   on an increasing share of our more ""conversational"" demands,   common requests we want addressed with the immediacy we expect   from dialogue (""Cancel my doctor's appointment."" ""Pause that   music!"" ""What's a good non-fiction book to read on the beach? ...   Great, order that one."")As the technology grows capable of handling increasingly   nuanced and complex requests, and as voice-enabled devices   proliferate and evolve, we can expect more users to grow   comfortable engaging with the technology around the home, in the   workplace, and gradually more pervasive aspects of society.Andthat'swhere the real opportunities begin.The opportunity at handSome of the biggest tech empires in modern history have been   built around the personal computer, internet, and smartphone,   each of which has provided the infrastructure for technology to   penetrate deeper and more reflexively into everyday life,   allowing creative companies to reach consumers in entirely new   ways.In just 10 years, the iPhone helped Apple grow to become the   largest corporation in the world, but it also popularized   smartphone technology in the U.S., helping to create the   infrastructure that in turn enabledFacebook(NASDAQ: FB) ,Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) , Alphabet, Uber,Snap, Amazon,Shopify(NYSE: SHOP) , and countless others to create businesses that   reach deeper into our lives than any before.Image Source: Author's iPhoneAnd yet voice technology is going deeper.It's becoming an invisible, always-listening medium that   surrounds us, weaving itself more seamlessly into the fabric of   our lives than any before it. It's called on using our most   instinctual, reflexive form of communication, and it's accessible   in the time it takes to form words. It's a technology that   provides tomorrow's innovators a far more intimate and pervasive   way to help us satisfy our digital wants.It's a startling but increasingly inevitable reality for both   investors and society.In Part II: The Playing Field, I'll discuss various players   involved in the race to commercialize voice computing.

The 3 Best Stocks to Profit From the Rise of China;3/11/2017;"With a massive, growing economy and a ballooning middle class,   China represents a major opportunity for many American companies.   Here's whyWalt Disney(NYSE: DIS) ,Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) , andCheniere Energy(NYSEMKT: LNG) are well-positioned to benefit from the continued   rise of China.The world's most beloved entertainment companyBeth McKenna(Walt Disney):I can't think of a better way to profit from the ever-rising   number of Chinese citizens joining the middle class than to   invest inDisney stock. Last June, the legendary entertainment giant opened its   first theme park in mainland China, the massive $5.5 billion   Shanghai Disney, as it aims to capture the ballooning disposable   dollars of many Chinese consumers.So far, Disney Shanghai's results have surpassed the company's   expectations. The park had hosted more than 7 million guests at   the time of the company's first-quarter earnings call on Feb.   8. Disney's management has said on the last two quarterly   earnings calls that the park is expected to come very close to   breaking even in fiscal 2017, which is impressive given how new   it is and its humongous cost to build. This, of course, means   that the park should start contributing to Disney's profits in   fiscal 2018.makeArticleAd();Disney Shanghai. Image source: Disney.Disney has been delighting people in the Western world for   generations with its iconic theme parks, as well as its movies,   TV shows, and dizzying array of consumer products. So, there's   every reason to believe that the Chinese people and visitors to   China will come to love Disney Shanghai just as much as Americans   and visitors to the United States adore Disneyland and Disney   World. That, coupled with Disney's unmatched intellectual   property of characters makes Disney a great stock to own as   China's economy continues to expand in the decades ahead.Trouble and opportunityTim Green(Apple):Apple has been having all sorts of trouble in China lately. Total   sales in China dropped 12% year over year during Apple's first   quarter despite a rise in global revenue. This disappointing   result was actually an improvement: Fourth-quarter sales in China   tumbled 30% year over year, and third-quarter sales crashed   33%.Apple's weak performance in China during the past few quarters   doesn't mean the company's growth opportunities in the country   are dead. Apple faces intense competition in China from local   companies as well asSamsung, and its brand doesn't quite have the same power as it has in   the U.S. But an innovative product -- perhaps a revamped iPhone 8   later this year -- could reverse its fortunes and force its   rivals to scramble to keep up.Image source: Apple.Regaining market share in China won't be easy, and it's   possible that competition is just too fierce for the company to   both grow sales and maintain its margins in the country. Flagship   phones from Chinese companies selling at a fraction of the price   Apple charges will be tough to beat. Apple will need to come up   with something truly unique to drive sales higher. It certainly   has the resources to do it.Filling one of China's largest needsTyler Crowe(Cheniere Energy):There are countless stories about the size and scale of   China's thirst for commodities. Ever since China switched gears   to a more market-driven economy, demand for basic materials and   energy has grown by a staggering amount. Recently, though, we   have seen a shift in the types of commodities China wants, and   those shifting trade winds are opening up new opportunities,   namely in liquefied natural gas (LNG).One thing that China has been working on rather remarkably in   recent years is reducing pollution in its cities. The biggest   culprit for air pollution has been burning coal for power, making   steel, and other industrial practices. So the country has been   shifting away from coal. In fact, in January China announced it   was canceling prior plans to install 120 gigawatts of coal-fired   power plants -- that's equivalent to 10% of the U.S.' total   generation capacity. With incomes growing and urbanization still   happening at a rapid rate, China is going to need to fill those   energy demands, and LNG is going to be one of the major power   sources to fill that gap.We're already seeing this happen. In 2016, total imports of   LNG into China increased 32.8% to 26.06 million metric tons,   and that is expected to grow to more than 105 million metric tons   per year by 2030. There are few companies out there better   positioned to take advantage of this coming LNG boom than   U.S.-based Cheniere Energy. As the U.S.' first LNG exporter, the   company already sent 10% of its 2016 cargoes to China, and that   was only from two of the possibly 11 liquefaction trains that   Cheniere has on the docket to develop over the next half   decade.Some might argue that Cheniere will struggle to deliver to the   Asian market because of its locations in the U.S. Gulf Coast.   Transporting LNG via ship is expensive and there are a lot of LNG   export terminals coming online in the Pacific Rim. That has yet   to be an issue, as the company's access to cheap domestic gas   offsets these costs. In fact, 28% of its 2016 sales were to the   Asia Pacific region, so that higher transportation cost hasn't   really become an issue for the company yet.China's policies can shift on a dime from time to time, but   betting on LNG and Cheniere Energy is a smart move as the country   cleans up its energy act.10 stocks we like better than Wal-MartWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock     tip, it can pay to listen.

3 Growth Stocks I'd Buy Right Now;3/11/2017;"The recent bull market has pushed many growth stocks'   valuations into the stratosphere. Thankfully, not every growth   stock is priced for perfection.Skyworks Solutions(NASDAQ: SWKS) ,Regeneron Pharmaceuticals(NASDAQ: REGN) , andUnder Armour(NYSE: UA) (NYSE: UAA) all hold promising growth potential, yet   are currently trading at attractive valuations. Here's why I'd   happily buy any of them today.Image Source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();The smartphone slump is overSkyworks Solutions is a leading manufacturer of radio   frequency chips that help devices connect to the internet. While   this company's stock has been rallying for several years now, it   put investors on an unpleasant roller coaster ride in   2016. Shares were slammed over concerns that demand for   smartphones was slowing. Those fears proved to be well-founded.   The company went on to produced a series ofearnings reportsthat saw its top line head in the wrong direction. That's not   something growth investors wanted to see, leading many traders to   hit the sell button.Thankfully, the worst of the smartphone slowdown appears to be   over. When Skyworks reported fiscal first-quarter results in   January, management predicted that revenue in the upcoming   quarterwould rise by 8%. Better yet, management credited its upbeat guidance to an   ""expanding product pipeline and accelerating design win   momentum."" That hints that its efforts to diversify its business   away fromAppleandSamsung-- which are two of its biggest customers -- are starting to pay   off.Looking ahead, investors have reasons to believe that the   top-line growth is here to stay. Skyworks is well positioned   to benefit from the ""Internet of Things"" trend. In addition, the   rollout of 5G wireless technology also promises to be a massive   tailwind. When adding in the potential for margin improvement and   the company's habit of buying back stock, analysts believe   that Skyworks' bottom line will grow by nearly 15% annually over   the next five years. That's quite a fast growth rate for a   company trading for less than 14 times forward earnings.New drugs to the rescueWhile long-term investors in biotech giant Regeneron   Pharmaceuticals haveenjoyed a phenomenal run, the company's recent performance hasn't been all that   impressive. Shares are down more than 34% from their highs in   2015. What gives?You can blame the downfall on a number of factors. First, the   company reported ahandfulofclinicalsetbacks in 2016 that gave investors pause. Next, the FDA   rejected sarilumab -- a hopeful treatment for rheumatoid   arthritis -- because of manufacturing concerns. Finally, the   company is losing a legal battle withAmgenover its new cholesterol-busting drug, Praluent. When adding in   slowing sales of its top-selling drug, Eylea, it's no wonder   shares have headed in reverse.Despite all of the bummer news, I think there are reasons for   optimism. First, Regeneron andSanofiare slated to receive a go/no-go decision from the FDA in   the coming weeks about their new eczema drug candidate,   Dupixent. Many believe this drug holds blockbuster   potential, so getting the green light could help to reignite   investors' enthusiasm. Next, sarilumab should be resubmitted to   the FDA soon now that the manufacturing issues are completed.   Finally, while Eylea's state-side growth rates are stalling, the   drug is still growing by double-digits overseas.When added together, Regeneron offers reasons to believe that   it is still a growth company. Market watchers appear to agree.   Current estimates call for bottom-line growth of nearly 19%   annually over the next five years. With shares trading for 25   times forward earnings estimates, I think this is a growth stock   worthy of your capital.This growth story isn't bustedThe last year hasn't been kind to shareholders of Under   Armour. The company's stock has shed more than half of its value   after management took an ax to profit growth projections. The   original forecast called for $800 million in profits by 2018, but   the company has since abandoned that target. When adding in a   holiday quarter that featured sales growth of just 12%, it is   understandable why some investors fear that this growth story is   over.Despite the pain, I refuse to give up on Under Armour. In   fact, I think the huge sell-off is actually a great opportunity   to get in.Why am I still bullish? First, why sales growth was   disappointing in the fourth quarter, there are a handful of   factors that explain the slowdown. North American retail stores   in general performed poorly during the holiday season, and 85% of   Under Armour's revenue is derived stateside. That means the   company isn't immune to the slowdown in retail. In addition, 2016   also featured a number of high-profile bankruptcies from   retailers like Sport's Authority, Eastern Mountain Sports, Sports   Chalet, and more. Those headwinds should abate in 2017, and a new   partnership withKohl'sshould also help to shore up the company's retail   presence.Second, while overall results were weak, Under Armour did have   a few pockets of strength. International sales were especially   strong, rising 63% last year. That tells me that this brand has   overseas appeal, which is most certainly a positive sign.Finally, the company's direct-to-consumer strategy also   appears to be working. Revenue from this channel grew 23%   last year and comprises 40% of total sales. Continued growth here   could go a long way toward offsetting any future retail sales   weakness.While Under Armour's stock doesn't look classically cheap   --it never does-- I still think this company has enough growth potential left to   more than justify an investment.10 stocks we like better than Under Armour (A   Shares)When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Top Stocks Billionaires Are Buying Now;3/10/2017;"Keeping tabs on what iconic billionaire investors George Soros, Warren Buffett, and Carl Icahn are doing with their money can help you find new money-making ideas. What have Soros, Buffett, and Icahn been buying lately? According to reports,Celgene Corp(NASDAQ: CELG) ,Apple Inc.(NASDAQ: AAPL) , andBristol-Myers Squibb(NYSE: BMY)  are among the stocks they've recently been adding to their portfolios. Since these companies have catalysts that could send shares higher, it might be time to buy them in your portfolio, too.Soros buys CelgeneGeorge Soros is known for a rapid-fire investment approach, and that means the stocks that get bought by Soros Fund Management might not stick around too long.makeArticleAd();Image source: Celgene Corp.Although Soros short-term style means following in his footsteps might not be the best way to build a long-term portfolio, there are reasons why you might want to follow his lead and buy Celgene's shares, and then hold onto them even after Soros sells.According to quarterly filings with the SEC, Soros Fund Management bought a small stake in Celgene during the fourth quarter, and while the position was tiny relative to Soros money under management, it could still prove to be very profit-friendly.Celgene is arguably the best in its industry at developing and commercializing billion dollar blockbuster drugs. It markets top-selling medicine used in multiple myeloma, pancreatic cancer, and psoriasis, and in February, it reported data that could eventually lead to it having a best-seller in multiple sclerosis, too.Specifically, management told investors last month that a pivotal trial for ozanimod, its oral multiple sclerosis drug,was a success. Ozanimod reduced MS relapses more than Avonex, an injection-based therapy that generates $2 billion in annual sales, and importantly, it did so with safety data strong enough to have me thinking it will disrupt this $19 billion per year market.The oral MS drugs that are currently available generate over $8 billion in annual sales, but there are concerns over their safety. Tecfidera, the top-selling oral MS drug, has been associated with a rare brain disease, and Gilenya, the second-best selling oral MS drug, can cause a worrisome drop in heart rate. If ozanimod notches FDA approval, then I think it could win away considerable market share from those two drugs.Ozanimod could also be a blockbuster because of ongoing trials that may expand its use into ulcerative colitics and Crohn's disease.Because Celgene thinks its revenue will surge from about $11 billion this year to $21 billion in 2020, and its earnings per share will more than double to at least $13 during the period, there appears to be no shortage of growth on the horizon. Since it boast one of the industry's best balance sheets, it has a proven track record of successfully marketing new drugs, and it has ozanimod in the wings, I think there's plenty of reason why this Soros buy can be added to every day investor portfolios.Warren Buffett takes a big bite of AppleWarren Buffett still uses a flip phone to make calls, but that didn't stop him from making consumer device giant Apple one of hisbiggest stock holdings.Image source: Getty Images.Apple showed up inBerkshire Hathaway's portfolio early last year, and since then it's become his second largest position. Berkshire Hathaway's quarterly 13F report with the SEC shows he owned 57 million shares of Apple in December,  but recently Buffett told CNBC that his Apple stake has climbed to more than 130 million shares.Buffett's interest in Apple could be driven by optimism that consumers who had previously held off on upgrading their iPhone's are finally doing so. Last quarter, Apple reported that iPhone revenue began to climb again, reaching a record. He may also be attracted to the company's huge user base, which provides plenty of profit-friendly growth opportunities for Apple's services, including iTunes. Furthermore, he may be drawn to Apple's massive cash flow. Last year, $27 billion in cash flow helped it increase its cash and investments stockpile to a breath-taking $245 billion.Clearly, there's a lot to like about Apple right now. If the company can keep its foot on the innovation pedal, it should maintain the financial flexibility necessary to return increasingly more money to investors via its dividend. At current share prices, the company's dividend yield is 1.6%, but that dividend rate could grow if Apple increases its dividend payout. The company last increased its dividend by 10% in 2016, so another dividend increasecould be in the workssoon.Icahn targets Bristol-Myers SquibbIn February,The Wall Street Journalreported that iconic activist investor Carl Icahn is cozying up to biopharma giant Bristol-Myers Squibb. Icahn is quiet about his intentions, but his track record suggests profit-friendly changes could be coming at the drugmaker. In the past, Icahn's used his sway to shake-up C-suites, win seats on boards, arm-wrestle spin-offs, and convince companies tosell themselves outright.Who knows what his strategy is for Bristol-Myers Squibb, but the company's got a lot going on that makes it an intriguing target for Icahn (and potentially, you).Its best-selling drug is Opdivo, an immunotherapy that makes it more difficult for cancer cells to avoid detection by the immune system. Opdivo's won FDA approval in a few cancer indications, but it's widely used in battling advanced lung cancer and melanoma. The drug's ability to combat those cancers has made it a blockbuster seller, with annualized sales of $5.2 billion exiting the fourth quarter.While Opdivo unquestionably remains a top-selling medicine, Bristol-Myers Squibb's shares tumbled last year when a trial designed to further increase Opdivo's use in lung cancer fell short, and a competitors trial succeeded. The news was disappointing, but it's arguably turned Bristol-Myers Squibb's shares into a bargain bin buy.Bristol-Myers has dozens of ongoing trials that could expand Opdivo's use, including additional trials in lung cancer that could make last year's failure a moot point. Furthermore, Opdivo isn't its only fast-growing drug. It also co-markets the top-selling anticoagulant Eliquis with Pfizer. Last year, Eliquis sales jumped 80% to $3.3 billion.Because Bristol-Myers Squibb is forecasting sales growth again this year, but it's lost $30 billion in market cap since last fall, it's valuation has become much more attractive. Its trailing 12-month price to earnings ratio, for example, has fallen from above 30 to about 21. The sell-off in its shares has also resulted in its dividend yield growing from less than 2% last year to nearly 2.7% now.Admittedly, only Icahn can tell us what his plans are to rekindle Bristol-Myers Squibb's share price, but with big-time drugs already on the market, and a far more reasonable share price than a year ago, this stock might be worth investing in.10 stocks we like better than Bristol-Myers SquibbWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Now Is the Perfect Time to Buy Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) Stock;3/10/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOver the past 12 months,Verizon Communications Inc.(NYSE:VZ) stock has lost 6% of its value. And in 2017 alone, it's lost 8% even as theS&P 500has surged 6% higher. But those gains are all the more reason why you should by Verizon stock now.makeArticleAd();Source:Mike Mozart Via FlickrVerizon stock has been lagging as the company's growth has been tepid. The wireless market is saturated and competitive.In the most recent quarter, Verizon posted a slight earnings miss and a decline in sales. Meanwhile, earnings are barely supposed to inch higher in the next few years - far from the double-digit growth of the half decade prior. In fact, Wall Street's forward-looking estimates are slowly but surely shrinking with each month.7 Future Blue-Chip Stocks You Need to BuyBut the decline in Verizon stock spells opportunity. The company has three solid avenues toward growth and, if none of those pan out, another way to reward loyal investors. Take a look.Unlimited DataRecently, some analysts have suggested that Verizon's move to offer unlimited data is going to crush its margins. I disagree. Offering unlimited data is more mental than practical; it's a marketing move - one that puts Verizon back above a competitor likeT-Mobile US Inc(NASDAQ:TMUS) - as opposed to a margins-eater.T-Mobile has been competing mostly with appealing offers, but can't compete on speed and coverage. Unlimited data tips the scales back to Verizon. At this stage, gaining customers is one of the most important avenues for Verizon to grow, especially as its AOL and landline businesses are dead and buried.Yahoo AcquisitionThere has been some uncertainty around Verizon's acquisition of Yahoo due the latter's data breach. But while that's a short-term hurdle to deal with, it doesn't change the appeal of the buy.As Verizon's CFO said during the most recent earnings call: ""Our pending Yahoo acquisition would further increase our opportunity to scale in the digital media space, with its 1 billion-plus monthly average unique viewers.""The deal is expected to close in the second quarter, so the April 20 earnings call may have more details that will help regain investor confidence in the buy.Internet of ThingsThe most promising part of recent Verizon earnings report has been growth in Internet of Things (IoT) revenue. In the most recent quarter, IoT enjoyed a 21% year-over-year expansion. Meanwhile, including acquisitions, IoT revenues increased more than 60% in fourth-quarter 2016. Verizon expects to sustain this trend to continue, which could drive revenue growth back into the red.Bottom Line on Verizon StockThe best part about Verizon stock, though, is that even if none of these growth avenues pan out, the company will still reward loyal investors with a consistent quarterly payout. Verizon paid $9.3 billion in dividends in 2016 and current sports a forward annual dividend yield of almost 5% and plenty of cash to keep that chugging. Verizon boasts $2.88 billion in cash - double its debt as of the most recent quarter.Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Is a Jekyll-and-Hyde Trade Right NowWhile Verizon stock has been lagging of late, that softness translates to a sweet yield. And if earnings get back on track due to any of the aforementioned drivers, you can bet investors will have an especially mouth-watering yield on cost.Hilary Kramer is the editor ofGameChangers,Breakout Stocks,High Octane Trader,Absolute Capital ReturnandValue Authority.

Why General Electric Company (GE) Stock Is STILL a Powerhouse;3/10/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsInvestors should consider holding diversified companies as part of their investing strategy. These conglomerates operate in multinational jurisdictions, don't rely on a single sector for revenue and in some cases, pay out a regular dividend.makeArticleAd();Source:Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified)General Electric Company(NYSE:GE), whose shares are valued at just 15.7 times forward earnings, has a dividend yielding 3.2%.Its long-term debt (of 1.39x equity) is more than manageable. If GE stock dips more, this is the stock to consider. In the third quarter, General Electric was third only toMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) andApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) in buying back shares.In Q3, the company bought back $3.7 billion. Apple repurchased $6 billion, while Microsoft bought back $4.4 billion. GE returned $30.5 billion to shareholders last year. This included a share buyback of $22 billion.The company is not a favorite pick among the analysts, despite the respectable General Electric dividend. JPMorgan added GE stock as a top stock to avoid, citing sub-par core operating performance.8 Dividend Growth Stocks Raising The BarInvestors need not pay any attention to analysts there. General Electric has strong leadership under CEO Jeffrey Immelt. It is embracing technology by focusing on the Internet of Things with its ""smart machines"" development.Growth Potential of GE StockGeneral Electric's move to merge its oil and gas services business withBaker Hughes Incorporated(NYSE:BHI) is a net positive.The energy sector is uncertain and it faces slow growth. Despite the challenging oil and gas market ahead, GE stock still kept up with its pace of dividends and share buybacks. On its fourth-quarter conference call, General Electric saidthe sector is stabilizing:""In oil and gas, the environment continues to be challenging and activity levels remain muted, external market indicators appear to be stabilizing with expected more balanced supply and demand fundamentals, partly influenced by the recent OPEC production agreement. U.S. onshore rig count grew 33% versus the third quarter, but was essentially flat versus the beginning of the year.""Although orders fell 27% year-over-year, GE forecast no change in E&P spending. If the oil and gas market bottomed late last year, the company will start seeing orders growing at its Alstom unit.The offshore drilling and sub-sea will still be a drag this year. General Electric hopes business picks up in North America onshore. It also needs the Middle East and Europe to stabilize. If that does not happen, this segment will not meet the company's expectation of a smaller revenue decline in the second half of the year.General Electric's Earnings OutlookThe 2017 earnings-per-share forecast of $1.60 to $1.70 a share may prove too low an estimate for GE stock. In the meantime, management is continuing with its plans on returning between $19 billion to $21 billion to shareholders this year.General Electric reported respectable growth in many of its units. For example, revenue at HCS (health and life science) grew by 2 %. Immelt expects Aviation to grow again this year. GE is also improving its operating efficiency. A new IT structure that runs horizontally will save the company around $450 million.Investors shouldn't only consider General Electric the bellwether of the U.S. economy's health, as its prospects also depend on the health of the world economy. A strong ISM manufacturing indexnumber, which hit a two-year high, is just a one indicator suggesting GE stock's outlook is bright.As of this writing, Chris Lau did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 Dangerous Dividend Stocks to Dump Now7 Future Blue-Chip Stocks You Need to BuyThe postWhy General Electric Company (GE) Stock Is STILL a Powerhouseappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Celgene Corporation (CELG) Stock Is Staging a Tempting Breakout;3/10/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIf there was ever a doubt, the latest price action inCelgene Corporation(NASDAQ:CELG) should help ease those fears and usher in more investor cheer in the coming weeks. For investors sharing that vision, a CELG bull call spread can help capture additional enthusiasm without getting too carried away. Let me explain.makeArticleAd();Source:Wikimedia (Modified)In this strategist's opinion, Thursday was nothing short of solid confirmation Wall Street is more than a bit interested in owning Celgene. CELG stock tacked on 1.9%, with solid investor participation as the broader market spun its wheels Thursday.What was behind the bullish move?I suppose some investors may have liked what they heard or read as part ofCelgene's presentationat the Cowen Healthcare Broker conference on Wednesday? Or maybe UBS was an influence? The broker initiated coverage of CELG on Thursday with a""buy"" rating and $140 price target.Alternatively, is it possible Celgene investors felt some relief as""ObamaCare Lite""passed through two key House committees? If the hardline ""repeal and replace"" stance is eventually repackaged as ""revised"" legislation, could drug companies with targets on their backs for egregious pricing practices also find themselves in a better position to negotiate without too much harm to shareholders? Maybe?What is known with more authority is this; investors can buy a best-in-breed in biotech right now. And that meansbuying CELG stock for its growth at a reasonable price- as well as a breakout that suggests slightly less reasonable prices in the weeks ahead.CELG Stock Daily ChartBack in November, in front of the presidential election, there may have been some doubt about CELG stock's prospects. The area highlighted in yellow doesn't exactly suggest bulls were going to stage a party. Nonetheless, this strategist was optimistic on shares of Celgene and wrote as much in an article atInvestorPlace.It turns out the technical prognosis on CELG wasn't for naught. A secondary down channel breakout was quickly followed by a massive-size Donald Trump effect bullish price gap which has gone on to build a constructive ""W""-shaped base.In Thursday's session, confirmation for the bullish pattern emerged as CELG stock broke above its handle on heavier and above-average volume. The next test for shares will be a move through the highs of the base, but it's expected it won't prove much of a fight.Looking forward, given Celgene's large corrective move from 2015 into 2016 and described healthy base breakout, the former high of $140.72 set back in July 2015 and roughly 12% higher is a good initial price target for intermediate-term traders.CELG Stock Bull Call SpreadGiven our bullish outlook for Celgene and after reviewing CELG stock's options, the April $125/$130 bull call spread is thought to be a reasonably attractive play.Priced for $2.15 with CELG trading at $125.02, this bullish trader needs shares to rally by 1.7% to break even at expiration in April. Even with the April vertical's shorter-term lifespan, that shouldn't pose a problem for a breakout like Thursday's. And realistically, nor should the required 4% needed to maximize the vertical's profit potential of $2.85 and return of 133%.An Apple Inc. (AAPL) iPhone Factory in America? Maybe Not.Bottom line though, there are no guarantees shares of Celgene will move higher. The fact is even good-looking breakouts like the one in CELG stock can fail.But as those failures can also be volatile bearish affairs, it's nice to know that something other than a price chart has your back in containing and reducing risk when things don't go exactly as planned.Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in any of the securities or their derivatives mentioned in this article.

Especially when the iPhone - its most lucrative and visible product by far - is made in China.Deflecting criticism, Apple CEOTim Cook has gone on recordas saying it's the availability of skilled, trained workers that makes outsourcing manufacturing to China the strategy AAPL pursues, not the cheap labor. The possibility of a U.S. iPhone factory is something the company is reported to have asked Foxconn to investigate starting last June. Theresults weren't very positive.The latest remarks from Foxconn make the idea of the company building a U.S. Apple factory seem even less likely.Foxconn Chairman Throws Doubt on U.S. iPhoneNikkei Asian Reviewwas at an event marking the groundbreaking for a new industrial park … in China. There, Foxconn chairman Terry Goucommented on the possibility of building a U.S. iPhone factory. He had just returned from a trip to Washington after hinting his company might consider a large display panel factory in the U.S. (for TVs), as well as a molding factory.However, Gou did not sound enthused.In addition to echoing Apple CEO Tim Cook's concerns about the lack of a trained, skilled workforce, and noting the entire iPhone supply chain is located in China, Gou has concerns about red tape. He toldNikkei:""I am concerned as to whether the U.S. can resolve all the investment issues in only a few months' time. Does the U.S. offer incentive programs for foreign investors? They'll need to pass bills first, and we'll need to wait for American authorities to make a decision first.""In other words, the possibility of Foxconn building an Apple factory here to make iPhones is very low.Made in the USA iPhone Out of Reach … For NowWhat's sometimes forgotten is that a U.S. Apple factoryalreadyexists.

Other than events like Apple'sAAPLshareholder meeting and the Mobile World Congress, there were two very important product launches in tech world: Microsoft'sMSFTXbox Game Pass and Alphabet'sGOOGLYouTube TV.So here are the top stories from last week:Apple Has Annual Shareholder MeetingAt the annual shareholder meeting, Apple considered nine proposals, of which four were its own and five came from shareholders. Only Apple's proposals were approved.On the product front, Apple promised that Mac Pro customers wouldn't be ignored in the push to launch better iPhones as the creative segment remained important to it. On the iPhone front, he expressed satisfaction that the current lineup of SE, 7 and 7 Plus generated sales that were above company expectations. Cook also said that that the airpods were a ""cultural phenomenon"".As far as other products are concerned, Apple is fighting to meet demand for the Watch Series 2 and working to launch other new products (possibly an AR device).Apple Pay adoption is slower in the U.S. than internationally, Apple Music subscribers are at 20 million and App Store subscribers (including those for services like Netflix) are now 150 million.Another important question addressed by the CEO was with respect to U.S. manufacturing. He said that two-thirds of Apple jobs were in the U.S. (Apple has created 2 million American jobs) and he would work to bring more. He also mentioned that Apple had paid out $50 billion to U.S. suppliers in 2016. In the meantime, favorable tax rules could see Apple bringing back more cash. While diversity remains a focus area, a proposal to make it more binding on management was shot down by shareholders.Apple remains committed to green initiatives and said that it was already running 93% of its operations on clean energy.Finally, on net neutrality, Cook said that while the company didn't engage in politics, it would be involved in policy formation. To that end, it would engage on net neutrality issues. Note that new FCC Chairman Ajit Pai recently said that net neutrality was a mistake, while Apple's position has always been that everyone's content should be treated equal.MWCLG, Sony, NokiaNOK, Samsung, Huawei, Motorola and Blackberry unveiled new devices at the Mobile World Congress 2017 held between Feb 27 and Mar 3. Some of the notable features of these devices are as follows:LG's all-new G6 smartphone got rid of the modular design of the G5 while also doing away with the removable battery (using a built-in 3,300mAh battery instead) and adding water and dust resistance, a rear mounted fingerprint scanner, USB Type C port and headphone jack.Sony had four phones on the show, the Mediatek P20-powered Xperia XA1 and XA1 Ultra and the Snapdragon 820-poweredXZ Premium and XZs. The XZs will run on the latest Android Nougat.Nokia, which is making a comeback this year showcased four models: the entry level Nokia 3, the mid-range Nokia 5 and Nokia 6 (based on the Symbian OS), and the feature phone Nokia 3310 that promises a 30-day battery life. The phones are relatively cheap and classy-looking.Samsung said it would have a launch event for the Galaxy S8 on Mar 29 and focused instead on the Galaxy Tab S3 with its 9.7-inch 2048x1536 (QXGA) Super AMOLED display, quad-core 2.15 GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 SoC and 4 GB of RAM. The device uses Android Marshmallow 6,000mAh batteryHuawei launched the 5.1-inch P10 and 5.5-inch P10 Plus, both of which run on the latest Android 7.0 Nougat, have 64-bit octa-core Hisilicon Kirin 960 processors with Mali-G71 MP8 GPUs. They were launched in 30 countries excluding the U.S. and Canada. It also announced the Android Wear 2.0-powered Watch 2 and Watch 2 Classic and the MediaPad T3 tablet.The KEYone from Blackberry was designed by TCL Communications of China came with its familiar physical keyboard. The convenience of the keyboard with its 52 shortcuts and increased security are the unique selling points.Lenovo/Motorola showed off the Moto G5 and Moto G5 Plus with the Plus having more of everything including size, snapdragon processor power, RAM and storage. But the cameras are comparable.Microsoft Launches Xbox Game PassMicrosoft has announced that it has a gaming subscription service in the works (i.e. it is in alpha testing). The service allows you access to 100 gaming titles for $9.99 a month. Unlike PlayStation Now, Sony's subscription service that only allows you to stream PS4 titles, Game Pass allows you to download the entire game for XB360 and XB1 so you can play uninterrupted without worrying about connectivity issues.If you like a game, the service allows you to buy it at a discount but if you don't, and happen to end your subscription, you lose access to the games completely. Some titles may be removed by a publisher during the month, but Microsoft says that most titles will be there right through the month before the list is refreshed, ensuring a constant and steady flow of games.Microsoft hopes that eventually Game Pass will become a platform that allows publishers to release their games on an episodic basis, much like TV programing. Publishers currently missing include Electronic ArtsEA, Ubisoft and Activision Blizzard but they will no doubt be there when it goes live. Also, the service is currently being tested for Xbox alone and plans to include Windows PCs have been shelved for now.Google Launches Youtube TVAlphabet's Google launched a live TV streaming service called YouTube TV that will stream 40 sporting and entertainment channels from CBS, ABC, NBC and Fox at $35 a month for a family of six. The service puts Google in direct competition against traditional operators like AT&TTwith its DirecTV Now, DISH NetworksDISHwith its Sling TV and CBS with its All Access.

Sears Holdings Corp (SHLD) Soars Amid Potential for More Closings;3/10/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSears Holdings Corp(NASDAQ:SHLD) shares were up by double digits on Friday amid what appears to be optimism over the possibility of more store closures prompting a short squeeze in SHLD stock.makeArticleAd();Source:Mike Mozart via FlickrSears is coming off afourth-quarter beat on the top and bottom lines, but with still-horrid numbers. Revenues in Q4 were down more than 16% to $6.1 billion, and the company lost $607 million.Nonetheless, SHLD stock rebounded by 7%-plus Thursday, and now is up another 15% on Friday.Business Insider's Hayley Peterson writes that the company's conference call points to thepossibility of more store closings and sales. CFO Jason Hollar said:""We have a valuable real estate portfolio, which at the end of the fourth quarter comprised 1,050 leases with significant optionality, as well as 380 owned stores, many in prominent locations. We will continue to assess opportunities to right-size our store footprint and inventory levels aligned to our ongoing transformation to an asset-light integrated retail model.""Hayley surmises that ""By highlighting the leases with optionality, Hollar seems to be suggesting the point that Sears can find ways to either partially or entirely get out of those leases before they expire. Meanwhile, the owned stores can be sold for cash.""3 Short Squeeze Stocks That Are Ready to Fly MUCH HigherSHLD has knocked its store count down by nearly 600 stores over the past five years as it tries to repay debt amid a failure to turn around the core business.The short-term optimism in SHLD stock appears to be scaring what is an overwhelmingly bearish crowd. Roughly 84% of Sears' float was sold short as of the most recent data, good for a short ratio of 8.52 - basically, it would take more than eight days' worth of selling at average volumes to clear out all the bearish bets on SHLD.As of this writing, Robert Martin did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceSnap Inc (SNAP) Stock Is the Perfect Buy at This PriceHow to Trade Apple Inc.

Today, we'll look at that and otherApple Rumorsfor Thursday.makeArticleAd();iPad Reveal:A new rumor claims that Apple will show off its next generation of iPad tablets on April 4, 2017, reportsBGR. This rumor is based on rumored availability dates for many of AAPL's next generation tablets, many of which are April 4. The rumor also claims that the tech company will hold a special event to introduce the tablets. It claims this event will take place at the new Steve Jobs. The theater is set to open in early April.MacBook Pro:Apple is now selling refurbished 2016 MacBook Pro laptops through its online store,MacRumorsnoted. The new option allows customers to purchase refurbished 2016 MacBook Pro computers with various different specs. One thing that all of these refurbished MacBook Pro laptops have in common is that they lack the Touch Bar that was introduced last year. Many of them also seem to be high-end laptops, but listings change over time and others will likely start showing up soon.App Store:Apple is now restricting iOS app updates that change app permissions without App Store approval, reportsAppleInsider. This means that many apps that download their own updates outside of the App Store may not be able to do so in the future. This restriction has always been in place since AAPL created the App Store, but it hasn't strongly enforced it until just recently. This means it may take app developers longer to push out updates in the future due to having to wait for App Store approval.Check out more recentApple RumorsorSubscribe to Apple Rumors:RSSThe postThursday Apple Rumors: iPad Reveal Event May Take Place on April 4appeared first onInvestorPlace."

Warren Buffett Isn't Trying to Beat the Market;3/9/2017;"If you're expecting high returns fromBerkshire Hathaway's(NYSE: BRK-A) (NYSE: BRK-B) stock portfolio, you may want to   pay attention to what Charlie Munger has to say, and then   carefully reconsider your assumption.At the recentDaily Journalmeeting, Warren Buffett's sidekick, Charlie Munger, explained   that Buffett doesn't necessarily have high returns in mind when   he buys a stock for Berkshire's portfolio. Munger used Berkshire   Hathaway's purchase ofExxonMobilstock as an example in how Buffett's investment process has   changed:[Y]ou know why Warren bought Exxon? As a cash substitute. He     would have never done that in the old days. We had a lot of     cash and we thought Exxon was better than cash over the     short-term. That's a different kind of thinking than the way     Warren came up.makeArticleAd();Munger isn't kidding. This is very different than how Buffett   has traditionally invested.The Exxon tradeIn 2013, Berkshire paid $90.86 per share for its multibillion   dollar Exxon stake. In the fourth quarter of 2014, when Berkshire   liquidated its investment, Exxon shares traded for an average of   $93.27 per share, according to a report byBloomberg. Thus, Buffett purchased and subsequently sold about $4 billion   of Exxon stock in a round-trip that earned Berkshire shareholders   a single-digit return after dividends. Most importantly,   Berkshire was in and out in less than two years.This quick trade is very uncharacteristic of Buffett, who is   famous for taking the long view. In his 1996 letter to   shareholders, Buffett wrote: ""If you aren't willing to own a   stock for ten years, don't even think about owning it for ten   minutes.""That advice, it seems, no longer applies to how Berkshire   manages its portfolio.Image source: Getty Images.One of the most important lessons I've ever learned as an   investor is that there are no accidents in disclosure, whether   the contextual clues appear in SEC filings or the documents that   accompany them. That's why I find it so interesting that Buffett   went out of his way to clarify how Berkshire views its stock   portfolio in his annual letter to shareholders this year.Buffett wrote the following on page 20 of his annual   letter:Sometimes the comments of shareholders or media imply that     we will own certain stocks ""forever."" It is true that we own     some stocks that I have no intention of selling for as far as     the eye can see (and we're talking 20/20 vision). But we have     made nocommitmentthat Berkshire will holdanyof its marketable securities forever.He added, ""[W]e regard any marketable security as available   for sale, however unlikely such a sale now seems.""With that, Buffett makes it clear that its portfolio of public   stocks is always for sale, if the price is right, or if Berkshire   has better uses for the cash. It's a curious new detail, one that   comes just months after Berkshire put more than $16 billion to   work purchasing shares ofAppleand four airlines, industries that Buffett might be willing to   invest in, but only if he doesn't have to commit to holding   forever.10 stocks we like better than Berkshire Hathaway (A   shares)When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Apple Inc. Should Thank WikiLeaks for Its CIA Reveal;3/9/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOn Tuesday, WikiLeaks released ""Vault 7,"" a huge collection of documents that reveal hacking tools used by the CIA. While the dump paints the CIA in an unflattering light, the fallout may well be worse for some of the world's largest tech companies, includingApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL).makeArticleAd();Source: AppleSpecifically, the CIA has a long list of iOS exploits it has used to gain access to iPhones. Despite being named along with numerous other giants of tech, the latest WikiLeaks dump actually highlights a key advantage for Apple in particular.And while its aura of security may emerge tarnished, the iPhone may actually come out ahead over the long term thanks to WikiLeaks.What Was in WikiLeaks Vault 7?The latestWikiLeaks dump involves 8,761 documentsoutlining a wide range of CIA hacking tools, including viruses, malware, zero-day exploits, trojans and remote control systems.In addition there are 14 iOS exploits listed, several dozen Android vulnerabilities and methods for accessing encrypted chats (essentially reading the contentsbeforethey are encrypted by gaining access to the host device).9 Stocks to Buy That Are Growing Faster Than AmazonIt's not all smartphones, either. The CIA has developedmalware to infect computersrunning macOS, Windows and Linux. It's even capable of turning Samsung Smart TVs on their owners, using them as listening devices to record conversations.This Doesn't Look Good for AppleApple has long positioned itself as a privacy advocate. It has always played up the security of the iPhone and evenrefused an FBI request to unlock the iPhoneused by a shooter in 2015's San Bernardino terrorist attack.Apple CEO Tim Cook released a written statement at the time, saying:""… the U.S. government has asked us for something we simply do not have, and something we consider too dangerous to create. They have asked us to build a backdoor to the iPhone.""The WikiLeaks Vault 7 release made it clear that iOS wasn't as secure as Apple had thought.How Apple Could Come Out AheadWikiLeaks is bad news for Apple in the short term. But the reveal of CIA hacking of mobile devices and consumer electronics could actually be good news for the company in the long run. Apple quickly went on record as saying many of the vulnerabilities identified in the WikiLeaks Vault 7 documentswere already addressed with iOS 10. And it is working to identify and patch any new issues.Apple and Google chose very different strategies when it comes to smartphones. Apple controls every aspect of iOS - its mobile operating system - as well as the hardware. It pushes out new major new iOS versions yearly and update releases (the kind that fix bugs or security issues) on demand. As a result,nearly 80% of all iPhones are currently running iOS 10.Google also releases new versions of Android yearly, but largely relies on smartphone manufacturers and wireless carriers to approve and push updates. They have little incentive to do so, since lacking the latest Android features could be a reason to buy a new smartphone.With such a wildly varying assortment of smartphones, updates can often be problematic, leading to support issues. As a result, the latest version of Android is on just 2% of all Android smartphones, while themajority are running software released in 2014 or earlier.In other words, even if Googlehadaddressed most of the issues in Android Nougat as claimed, right now, there arehundreds of millions of Android devices that could still be affectedbecause they're running old software. Most iPhone users, however, should be okay, and the rest can be assured that Apple's consistent program of releases will address any outstanding issues.Apple has a similar approach with macOS. It updates its Mac computer operating system regularly and pushes out security updates as issues are discovered. With the smart home,Apple takes extreme security measures, including costly custom chips, factory inspections and end-to-end encryption between connected devices. This approach has meant slower adoption for its HomeKit platform, but with the benefit of being far more secure than the competition.As for smart TVs eavesdropping on you, that's just another reason to buy a relatively inexpensive streaming box - like an Apple TV - instead.The Age of Privacy Is OverMany people had been living with a probably naive expectation that everything they did with their smartphone was private and secure, especially when using encrypted apps. The latest WikiLeaks dump should end that notion and leave people watching their TV, PC and even smart thermostat with suspicion.Snap Inc. (SNAP) Aims to Win Where Disney (DIS) FailedBut by the time this plays out, it's also likely to make it clearer than ever before that some products are more secure than others, and some companies are in a better position to fix any vulnerabilities.Apple may have been named as one of the victims of CIA hacking, but it was quick to respond and quick to make it clear many of the WikiLeaks exploits have already been addressed. Perhaps more importantly, Apple's product strategy puts it in the position to be a leader in offering the most secure devices possible going forward.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceApple Inc.

Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Is Betting BIG on Google Cloud in 2017;3/9/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsCloud services are a big business that is only getting bigger. When you think of the cloud, the one company that tends to immediately come to mind isAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) - if for no other reason than when its AWS cloud servers go down, half the internet seems to go with them. ButAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL) is betting big on the cloud too, and at its Next 2017 event, the company had some big announcements.makeArticleAd();Source: GoogleGoogle cloud is celebrating some much-needed wins, including new partners, a significant steal for G Suite and recognition for topping cloud providers in 2016 for reliability.Google Cloud Takes Aim at AWS, AzureThe public cloud is currently dominated by Amazon's AWS, withover 30% of the market- triple the footprint of second-placeMicrosoft Corporation's(NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure. Google cloud is in fourth place, trailingInternational Business Machines Corp.(NYSE:IBM).The cloud is a huge market already and it's expected to get far larger, quickly. Forrester recently pegged the expected value of the public cloud - services like AWS, Azure and Google Cloud - toreach $236 billion by 2020.9 Stocks to Buy That Are Growing Faster Than AmazonAnd Google wants a bigger piece of that pie.At its Next 2017 conference keynote, the company made the case for choosing Google cloud over AWS or Azure. While noting that it has invested $30 billion in its cloud services, the company rattled off an impressive list of companies that haverecently made the move to Google cloud.eBay Inc.(NASDAQ:EBAY) andColgate-Palmolive Company(NYSE:CL) represent the large corporate side of Google cloud's capabilities, while popular apps likePokemon GoandSnap Inc.'s(NYSE:SNAP) Snapchat show off its suitability for hosting consumer apps.Google cloud's head Diane Greene, took the opportunity to fire a shot at Amazon's AWS and the bad PR it's received for large-scale outages. Chances are, you were affected by anAWS issue at the end of Februarythat slowed or took down thousands of websites, apps and services for hours.Greene noted that Google cloud has been recognized for topping all cloud service providers in availability for 2016. She puts that availability level at 99.999% reliability, which is very impressive.It certainly makes a case for switching from AWS.Big Wins for Google Cloud, and G SuiteSeveral big wins for Google cloud were also touted at Next 2017.SAP SE (ADR)(NYSE:SAP) is the world leader in enterprise resource planning software, counting over 345,000 companies as customers. Many large corporations rely on SAP software and it's big enough to be hosting its own cloud services. However, it has signed on for its SAP HANA database to be hosted on Google cloud, instead of at its own data centers.AsTechCrunchnotes,Microsoft and Amazon already had deals signed with SAP. Beating AWS and Azure to host HANA has an even greater significance given that the competition already had an established relationship with SAP.Drop Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock. Here's Why.Also announced at Next 2017 was a big win for G Suite, Google's cloud-hosted productivity apps.Verizon Communications Inc.(NYSE:VZ) announced it has dropped Microsoft Office for 150,000 employees, moving them instead to Google's G Suite.Look for Google to continue aggressively pushing Google cloud services in 2017. The company has been spending big on ramping up its infrastructure, its ""Other"" revenue (which includes cloud revenue) wasup 62% in the last quarterand the majority of its 2,100 hires in Q4 went to cloud operations.As Google cloud's Diane Greene said onstage, ""I think 2017 will be a good year, too.""As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceApple Inc.

The Bull Market Turns 8: These Dow Stocks Led the Way Higher;3/9/2017;"It's hard to believe, but eight years ago today, theDow Jones Industrials(DJINDICES: ^DJI) were below 7,000, and many feared further losses that could send the global financial markets into chaos. Just eight years later, the Dow has tripled from those levels, and the mood going forward is much more optimistic. When you look at what has powered the Dow's advance, the most interesting thing you'll notice is that seven component replacements within the venerable average have happened in relatively short order, and those additions have been major contributors to the gains that the average has enjoyed.makeArticleAd();^DJIdata byYCharts.The key winners in the DowBelow, you can see the stocks among the Dow's current components that have produced the largest total returns for shareholders over the past eight years:StockTotal Return Since 3/9/2009Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL)1,191%UnitedHealth(NYSE: UNH)954%Home Depot893%American Express750%Walt Disney691%Visa(NYSE: V)658%Boeing624%JPMorgan Chase584%DuPont576%Nike(NYSE: NKE)552%Data source:S&P Global Market Intelligence.It's illuminating that the top two returners and four in the top 10 have joined the Dow in just the past eight years. UnitedHealth Group came into the index in 2012, while Visa and Nike became Dow components in 2013. Apple is the most recent company to join the average, getting its invitation in 2015.Note that their late entry hasn't prevented some of these key stocks from having huge impacts on the average. Visa, for instance, has seen its stock nearly double since joining the index as international electronic payments volume has dramatically increased. Economic expansion has helped increase money flows, and Visa's ability to dip into that stream with its global payment network has paid off. Moreover, before Visa decided to split its stock, its high share price made it one of the most influential components within the Dow Jones Industrials, and the overall average benefited disproportionately from its gains than from moves in lower-priced stocks.For Apple, though, the influence hasn't been as significant. The tech giant's admission to the Dow came near its high point, shortly after a 7-for-1 stock split that brought its share price low enough to attract the attention of those who run the price-weighted average. In the following year, Apple lost a third of its value, but in the recent push higher for the Dow to new record levels, the iPhone maker has played an instrumental role, and shareholders have finally enjoyed some of the benefits.Image source: Getty Images.Making the Dow healthierUnitedHealth Group has given the Dow strong performance since its admission in 2012, with its share price more than tripling over that time span. The healthcare industry has seen a lot of change over that period, with the rise and seemingly imminent fall of the Affordable Care Act having presented substantial challenges to the health insurance industry. UnitedHealth has been able to benefit dramatically from going beyond health insurance through its Optum line of businesses, which incorporate pharmacy benefit management and various health-related services to try to get corporate customers to encourage wellness and health improvement practices. These services have helped clients cut their healthcare costs, and they've proved immensely profitable for UnitedHealth in its tenure as a Dow component.Finally, Nike has continued to prosper from the popularity of athletic apparel and footwear, but share price gains since it joined the Dow in 2013 have been more modest, amounting to a roughly 50% to 60% rise. New competition has emerged in the space, and that has forced Nike to retrench and find ways to use its powerful brand presence to stoke growth. The company remains the giant in the industry, but it will have to keep fighting in order to regain its dominance and send its stock back toward record levels.The Dow's climb since 2009 is monumental, and newly admitted stocks to the average have played a vital role. More importantly, Apple, UnitedHealth, Visa, and Nike will have to keep doing well if the Dow is to stay in and move further into record territory in 2017 and beyond.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Short International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) Stock For Free;3/9/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsI have been a long time critic ofInternational Business Machines Corp.(NYSE:IBM). The problem is, for the past 12 months, Wall Street hasn't shared my opinion, and IBM stock has been on fire.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockSo, I recently wrote abouthow to get paidto trade IBM stock. The trade, although not a home run, yielded easy profits.Today, I want to take the other side.IBM stock is near its all time highs, but it's showing a whiff of weakness. With so much uncertainty ahead of markets, I fear downside pressure in the near-term. So consider this short idea more a call against price action rather than company pessimism.By the way, I still don't like IBM's prospects, from a fundamental standpoint. They have failed to adopt their mega-machine of old into the new tech world. The highest-profile IBM focus has recently been artificial intelligence, but that is an old headline.It's taking too long to blossom into a cash cow.7 Stocks That Will Hit All-Time Lows in 2017Assuming that experts are correct with their expectations of big things from artificial intelligence, I can use this in my trade as a fundamental basis for the long-term prospects of IBM. Affirmation to this is the recent headline of IBM's alliance withSalesforce.com, Inc.(NYSE:CRM).Maybe hanging to the coattails of the growth monster like Salesforce could keep IBM's momentum going.How to Short IBM Stock for FreeThe bet:Buy IBM Apr $180/$175 debit put spread for $2 per contract. This is my maximum potential loss. The faster IBM stock falls through my spread, the faster my profits will accrue. I have a chance to double my money.Click to EnlargeSince this more of a technically driven trade, I want to lower my out of pocket risk. To do this I will sell downside risk against levels that I deem safe.The bank:Sell the IBM Jan 2018 $135 put for $3. I need IBM stock to stay above my strike sold or be put the stock. I only sell naked puts if I am willing and able to own IBM shares at that price. The 24% price buffer gives me a 90% theoretical chance of success on this leg.Drop Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock. Here's Why.By taking both trades, I would be getting paid to short IBM through April. Ideally, I need IBM stock to fall past my debit spread but stay above my credit sold. As long as IBM stock stays above my sold put, any premium I recapture from selling my debit spread would be profit. So I can still profit even if IBM does nothing.I am not required to hold my trades open through expiration. I can close them early for partial gains or losses. I only risk what I can afford to lose.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director ofSellSpreads.com. As of this writing, he did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Why You Really Need to Diversify;3/9/2017;"Diversification, and the benefits thereof, is something I have written about multiple times before. Recently, however, I have discovered two pieces of data that really highlight how important diversification is to a well-rounded investment strategy. The numbers are enough to terrify even the most devoted, concentrated investor.Time to diversify?The world's most well-known investors are all recognized for their love of concentrated stock portfolios. Several have even remarked that diversification is a waste of time and the only way to make money in the market is to have a concentrated equity portfolio. This is all well and good, but it is really not suitable advice for the average investor.makeArticleAd();The most famous investing gurus got where they are today by being good investors, but that is not to say there was not a degree of luck involved as well.What would have happened toWarren Buffett(Trades,Portfolio) if hisAmerican Express(AXP) investment had not worked out and the Salad Oil scandal had taken down the company? Or ifCoca-Cola(KO) was hit with such a massive bout of negative publicity it could never recover? If either of these scenarios unfolded, Buffett would not be where he is today.To give another example, what would have happened toCarl Icahn(Trades, Portfolio) if lawmakers had viewed his actions at TWA as criminal and thrown him in jail?There are certainly cases where this has happened, but because the ranks of the world's most famous investors are stalked by survivorship bias, it is difficult to realize that for every one Buffett there are tens of thousands of failed investors.That is why diversification is so important and critical for long-term investing success.Numbers don't lieResearch by Arizona State University finance professor Hendrik Bessembinder shows exactly why this is the case. To try and figure out the average return of single stocks over the long term, he studied the returns of 26,000 equities over the period of 1926 to 2015. Over this nine-decade period, equities created $31.8 trillion of wealth. The shocking thing is that all of this wealth was generated by just 4% of equities; 96% of stocks achieved nothing. Including inflation, the real return on 96% of the universe was actually negative. To put it another way, the average investor has a one in 24 chance of picking a stock that will generate positive returns over the long term.ExxonMobil(XOM) alone accounted for 3% of the wealth created over the period andApple(AAPL) accounted for about 2%.These findings are only reinforced by a report issued by JPMorgan last year. According to the report, titled ""The Agony & Ecstasy: The Risks And Rewards Of A Concentrated Stock Position,"" the return on the median stock since its inception versus an investment in the Russell 3000 Index is -54%.Furthermore, since 1980, 320 companies have been removed from the S&P 500 due to reasons of ""distress."" So, during the past three-and-a-half decades, 64% of the index has been turned over. Based on these figures, JPMorgan calculates the chance of actually finding an extreme winner is just 7%. Since the 1980s, 40% of all companies experienced a severe loss and never recovered.The bottom lineDiversification is not a bad strategy. Some of the world's most famous investors may advocate concentrated portfolios, but as the figures above show, you have to be very lucky to correctly pick a stock that produces positive returns over the long term. The chances of picking a winner are so low it is hard to justify even trying. That is possibly why Buffett advocates an index tracker fund for most investors -- the risk of picking the wrong stock and losing money over the long term is just too high!.Disclosure: The author owns no stock mentioned.Start afree 7-day trial of Premium Membershipto GuruFocus.Premium MembersThis article first appeared onGuruFocus."

Stocks to Buy: 3 Tech Stocks Paying Nice Dividends;3/9/2017;"Many of the bestdividend   stocksare found in sectors where the rate of change and disruption is   slow -- sectors like consumer staples, utilities, and banks. But   there are some excellent dividend stocks in the tech sector, too.Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) ,IBM(NYSE: IBM) , andMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) , for instance, all pay solid, growing   dividends.Here's a look at why each of these tech giants represents a   good bet for investors looking for income.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();Apple: dividend upsideApple offers the smallest dividend yield -- 1.6% -- of these   three stocks. But investors shouldn't overlook its   attractiveness. Apple's dividend easily makes up what it lacks in   yield with growth potential.Currently, Apple is paying out just 27% of its earnings,   leaving significant upside for dividend increases in the future.   Further, management has demonstrated how it's prioritizing   dividend growth since the company initiated its dividend in 2012.   Adjusted for a 7-to-1 stock split in 2014, Apple's dividend has   increased 50% since 2012.Apple's annual dividend increases have steadily remained at   about 10% -- a rate the company looks like it could sustain for   years to come.IBM: an above-average yieldWith a dividend yield of about 3.1%, IBM has the fattest   per-share payout of these three stocks. Even more, while IBM's   44% payout ratio -- the percentage of annual earnings it is   paying out in dividends -- is well above Apple's 27% payout   ratio, it's still low enough for investors to expect meaningful   dividend growth for years to come.Indeed, IBM's dividend has grown at a very healthy average   annualized rate of about 14% during the past five years. However,   the company's most recent dividend increase wasn't as substantial   as in past years. In 2016, IBM's dividend increased 7.7%, down   from an 18.2% hike in 2015, as the company'songoing transformationhas put pressure on net income.Despite the slowdown in IBM's dividend increases, the   company's 21 consecutive years of dividend increases, along with   its low payout ratio, set a solid precedent for ongoing dividend   increases over the long haul.Microsoft: enduring cash flow from a profitable business   modelMicrosoft's ability to generate heady levels of cash flow from   its profitable business model is undeniable. For the past 10   years, Microsoft's gross profit margin, or gross profit as a   percentage of revenue, has been between about 61% and 81%. Sure,   the software giant's gross profit margin is on the low end of   this range today -- at 61%. But the inherent profitability of   Microsoft's software-focused business, combined with the   stickiness of its Office suite and its enterprise applications   and services, means it can count on enduring cash flow for years   to come, to continue feeding investors solid dividends.Image source: Getty Images.With a 2.4% dividend yield, Microsoft offers investors a   better dividend yield than Apple, but it's still well behind   IBM's 3.1% dividend yield. While Microsoft's payout ratio of   69.5% is higher than IBM's, Microsoft's dividend as a percentage   of free cash flow -- at 42% -- better captures the software   giant's room for dividend increases. Recent one-time charges   against earnings and restructuring charges have suppressed net   income and pushed the company's payout ratio higher. By   comparison, Apple and IBM are paying out 23% and 41% of their   free cash flow in dividends.Microsoft's most recent annual increase was 8% -- and the   company's financials look set to support similar increases over   time.In general, income investors may not find many great dividend   stocks in tech. But these three stocks are just as worthy of a   spot in an income portfolio as go-to Dividend Aristocrats in   consumer staples, utilities, and banking.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Why Universal Display Corporation Stock Popped 28.6% in February;3/9/2017;"What happenedShares ofUniversal Display Corporation(NASDAQ: OLED) jumped 28.6% in the month of   February, according to data provided byS&P Global Market Intelligence, after the OLED specialist announcedstrong fourth-quarter 2016 resultsand encouraging guidance.So whatRevenue for the quarter grew 19.7% year over year, to $74.6   million, and it resulted in a 42.7% increase in net income to   25.8 million. Net income per share also climbed 41%, to $0.55. By   comparison, Wall Street was looking for revenue of just $68.6   million, and earnings of $0.42 per share.IMAGE SOURCE: UNIVERSAL DISPLAY.makeArticleAd();Universal Display's growth was driven by a combination of     higher OLED material sales (up 5%, to $29.2 million), an     increase in royalty and license fees (up 27%, to $43.6     million), and $1.8 million in contract research services     revenue from its acquisition of Adesis last year.But more importantly -- and just asUniversal Display management suggestedlast August -- the company finally saw customers commence     adoption of its next-generation phosphorescent OLED emitter     products. The company also made a $15 million investment in a     Barberton, Ohio, manufacturing plant owned byPPG Industries, which should double commercial production capacity for its     emitters.Now whatUniversal Display also told investors to expect full-year 2017   revenue to be in the range of $230 million to $250 million, or up   15.6% to 25.7% from 2016. That includes a $15 million license fee   increase under Universal Display's long-term deal withSamsungDisplay, and -- if recent supply chain reports prove accurate --   thecontinued adoptionof its flagship materials by other technology behemoths,   includingApple.Of course, Universal Display was quick to note that the OLED   industry is still in its early stages, so there are many   variables that could temporarily stifle that growth. But as the   company's technology becomes more ubiquitous with each passing   day, it's no surprise to see Universal Display stock trading near   all-time highs right now.10 stocks we like better than Universal     DisplayWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Can You Beat the S&P 500 at Its Own Game?;3/9/2017;"The S&P 500 isthebenchmark for most investors.The important stock index consists of 500 of the largest companies that are listed on the NYSE or the Nasdaq, and securities are weighted in the benchmark by market capitalization levels. Currently, top stocks in the benchmark include Apple (AAPL) at about 3.6% of the total, Microsoft (MSFT) at 2.5% of the total, and Exxon Mobil (XOM) at 1.65%.But while this approach is a great barometer for market health, is it the best way for investors to put their money to work? Investors have numerous options in this department, including products likeSPY,VOO, orIVV, as these simply follow the benchmark exactly as laid-out by the index creators. But is there a potentially better way?Enter Equal WeightIn this edition ofthe Dutram Report, I look for an alternate approach in a talk with Michael Willis, the lead portfolio manager of INDEX Funds. His key product, the Index Funds S&P 500 Equal Weight (INDEX), takes the same S&P 500 stocks, but invests in them equally.This means that instead of Apple accounting for nearly 4% of the total, or Microsoft making up 2.5% of the fund, each account for roughly 0.2% of the total, at least at rebalancing dates. And not just the mega caps, but each and every stock comes with this same weight, giving the fund an equal interest in giants like Exxon, and the smallest S&P 500 components alike.While this might sound like a small difference, we go over in the podcast how this actually ends up being something very important to overall returns. Michael discusses how nearly half of the S&P 500 (market cap weighted) is tied up in about 50 companies, and that the remaining 450 have to fight over the remainder. He argues that the equal weight is a much more balanced way to achieve exposure, while thefund's fact sheetshows that this approach has outperformed the market over long time periods.We also talk about the pros and cons of this approach, such as its potentially heavier weighting in mid-cap securities and what this means for investors, as well as some important fund specifics. This includes information regarding the cost and minimum investment, and also the reason for selecting a fund structure. We then go over the ways that INDEX differs from the ETF counterpart out there, the Guggenheim S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (RSP), looking beyond the lower cost of INDEX when compared to the Guggenheim fund.Bottom LineEqual weight investing is an overlooked strategy for targeting stocks, but it is clearly one that can lead to outperformance over long time periods. If you are curious about this approach, check out this podcast for everything you need to know about how it works, and if this can help improve returns for long-term investors.So, make sure to listen to this edition ofthe Dutram Reportfor a closer look at equal weight investing, and what the pros and cons of this approach are for those seeking a different way to play the S&P 500.

Today, we'll look at that and otherApple Rumorsfor Thursday.makeArticleAd();iPad Reveal:A new rumor claims that Apple will show off its next generation of iPad tablets on April 4, 2017, reportsBGR. This rumor is based on rumored availability dates for many of AAPL's next generation tablets, many of which are April 4. The rumor also claims that the tech company will hold a special event to introduce the tablets. It claims this event will take place at the new Steve Jobs. The theater is set to open in early April.MacBook Pro:Apple is now selling refurbished 2016 MacBook Pro laptops through its online store,MacRumorsnoted. The new option allows customers to purchase refurbished 2016 MacBook Pro computers with various different specs. One thing that all of these refurbished MacBook Pro laptops have in common is that they lack the Touch Bar that was introduced last year. Many of them also seem to be high-end laptops, but listings change over time and others will likely start showing up soon.App Store:Apple is now restricting iOS app updates that change app permissions without App Store approval, reportsAppleInsider. This means that many apps that download their own updates outside of the App Store may not be able to do so in the future. This restriction has always been in place since AAPL created the App Store, but it hasn't strongly enforced it until just recently. This means it may take app developers longer to push out updates in the future due to having to wait for App Store approval.Check out more recentApple RumorsorSubscribe to Apple Rumors:RSSThe postThursday Apple Rumors: iPad Reveal Event May Take Place on April 4appeared first onInvestorPlace."

Warren Buffett Isn't Trying to Beat the Market;3/9/2017;"If you're expecting high returns fromBerkshire Hathaway's(NYSE: BRK-A) (NYSE: BRK-B) stock portfolio, you may want to   pay attention to what Charlie Munger has to say, and then   carefully reconsider your assumption.At the recentDaily Journalmeeting, Warren Buffett's sidekick, Charlie Munger, explained   that Buffett doesn't necessarily have high returns in mind when   he buys a stock for Berkshire's portfolio. Munger used Berkshire   Hathaway's purchase ofExxonMobilstock as an example in how Buffett's investment process has   changed:[Y]ou know why Warren bought Exxon? As a cash substitute. He     would have never done that in the old days. We had a lot of     cash and we thought Exxon was better than cash over the     short-term. That's a different kind of thinking than the way     Warren came up.makeArticleAd();Munger isn't kidding. This is very different than how Buffett   has traditionally invested.The Exxon tradeIn 2013, Berkshire paid $90.86 per share for its multibillion   dollar Exxon stake. In the fourth quarter of 2014, when Berkshire   liquidated its investment, Exxon shares traded for an average of   $93.27 per share, according to a report byBloomberg. Thus, Buffett purchased and subsequently sold about $4 billion   of Exxon stock in a round-trip that earned Berkshire shareholders   a single-digit return after dividends. Most importantly,   Berkshire was in and out in less than two years.This quick trade is very uncharacteristic of Buffett, who is   famous for taking the long view. In his 1996 letter to   shareholders, Buffett wrote: ""If you aren't willing to own a   stock for ten years, don't even think about owning it for ten   minutes.""That advice, it seems, no longer applies to how Berkshire   manages its portfolio.Image source: Getty Images.One of the most important lessons I've ever learned as an   investor is that there are no accidents in disclosure, whether   the contextual clues appear in SEC filings or the documents that   accompany them. That's why I find it so interesting that Buffett   went out of his way to clarify how Berkshire views its stock   portfolio in his annual letter to shareholders this year.Buffett wrote the following on page 20 of his annual   letter:Sometimes the comments of shareholders or media imply that     we will own certain stocks ""forever."" It is true that we own     some stocks that I have no intention of selling for as far as     the eye can see (and we're talking 20/20 vision). But we have     made nocommitmentthat Berkshire will holdanyof its marketable securities forever.He added, ""[W]e regard any marketable security as available   for sale, however unlikely such a sale now seems.""With that, Buffett makes it clear that its portfolio of public   stocks is always for sale, if the price is right, or if Berkshire   has better uses for the cash. It's a curious new detail, one that   comes just months after Berkshire put more than $16 billion to   work purchasing shares ofAppleand four airlines, industries that Buffett might be willing to   invest in, but only if he doesn't have to commit to holding   forever.10 stocks we like better than Berkshire Hathaway (A   shares)When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Apple Inc. Should Thank WikiLeaks for Its CIA Reveal;3/9/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOn Tuesday, WikiLeaks released ""Vault 7,"" a huge collection of documents that reveal hacking tools used by the CIA. While the dump paints the CIA in an unflattering light, the fallout may well be worse for some of the world's largest tech companies, includingApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL).makeArticleAd();Source: AppleSpecifically, the CIA has a long list of iOS exploits it has used to gain access to iPhones. Despite being named along with numerous other giants of tech, the latest WikiLeaks dump actually highlights a key advantage for Apple in particular.And while its aura of security may emerge tarnished, the iPhone may actually come out ahead over the long term thanks to WikiLeaks.What Was in WikiLeaks Vault 7?The latestWikiLeaks dump involves 8,761 documentsoutlining a wide range of CIA hacking tools, including viruses, malware, zero-day exploits, trojans and remote control systems.In addition there are 14 iOS exploits listed, several dozen Android vulnerabilities and methods for accessing encrypted chats (essentially reading the contentsbeforethey are encrypted by gaining access to the host device).9 Stocks to Buy That Are Growing Faster Than AmazonIt's not all smartphones, either. The CIA has developedmalware to infect computersrunning macOS, Windows and Linux. It's even capable of turning Samsung Smart TVs on their owners, using them as listening devices to record conversations.This Doesn't Look Good for AppleApple has long positioned itself as a privacy advocate. It has always played up the security of the iPhone and evenrefused an FBI request to unlock the iPhoneused by a shooter in 2015's San Bernardino terrorist attack.Apple CEO Tim Cook released a written statement at the time, saying:""… the U.S. government has asked us for something we simply do not have, and something we consider too dangerous to create. They have asked us to build a backdoor to the iPhone.""The WikiLeaks Vault 7 release made it clear that iOS wasn't as secure as Apple had thought.How Apple Could Come Out AheadWikiLeaks is bad news for Apple in the short term. But the reveal of CIA hacking of mobile devices and consumer electronics could actually be good news for the company in the long run. Apple quickly went on record as saying many of the vulnerabilities identified in the WikiLeaks Vault 7 documentswere already addressed with iOS 10. And it is working to identify and patch any new issues.Apple and Google chose very different strategies when it comes to smartphones. Apple controls every aspect of iOS - its mobile operating system - as well as the hardware. It pushes out new major new iOS versions yearly and update releases (the kind that fix bugs or security issues) on demand. As a result,nearly 80% of all iPhones are currently running iOS 10.Google also releases new versions of Android yearly, but largely relies on smartphone manufacturers and wireless carriers to approve and push updates. They have little incentive to do so, since lacking the latest Android features could be a reason to buy a new smartphone.With such a wildly varying assortment of smartphones, updates can often be problematic, leading to support issues. As a result, the latest version of Android is on just 2% of all Android smartphones, while themajority are running software released in 2014 or earlier.In other words, even if Googlehadaddressed most of the issues in Android Nougat as claimed, right now, there arehundreds of millions of Android devices that could still be affectedbecause they're running old software. Most iPhone users, however, should be okay, and the rest can be assured that Apple's consistent program of releases will address any outstanding issues.Apple has a similar approach with macOS. It updates its Mac computer operating system regularly and pushes out security updates as issues are discovered. With the smart home,Apple takes extreme security measures, including costly custom chips, factory inspections and end-to-end encryption between connected devices. This approach has meant slower adoption for its HomeKit platform, but with the benefit of being far more secure than the competition.As for smart TVs eavesdropping on you, that's just another reason to buy a relatively inexpensive streaming box - like an Apple TV - instead.The Age of Privacy Is OverMany people had been living with a probably naive expectation that everything they did with their smartphone was private and secure, especially when using encrypted apps. The latest WikiLeaks dump should end that notion and leave people watching their TV, PC and even smart thermostat with suspicion.Snap Inc. (SNAP) Aims to Win Where Disney (DIS) FailedBut by the time this plays out, it's also likely to make it clearer than ever before that some products are more secure than others, and some companies are in a better position to fix any vulnerabilities.Apple may have been named as one of the victims of CIA hacking, but it was quick to respond and quick to make it clear many of the WikiLeaks exploits have already been addressed. Perhaps more importantly, Apple's product strategy puts it in the position to be a leader in offering the most secure devices possible going forward.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceApple Inc.

Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Is Betting BIG on Google Cloud in 2017;3/9/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsCloud services are a big business that is only getting bigger. When you think of the cloud, the one company that tends to immediately come to mind isAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) - if for no other reason than when its AWS cloud servers go down, half the internet seems to go with them. ButAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL) is betting big on the cloud too, and at its Next 2017 event, the company had some big announcements.makeArticleAd();Source: GoogleGoogle cloud is celebrating some much-needed wins, including new partners, a significant steal for G Suite and recognition for topping cloud providers in 2016 for reliability.Google Cloud Takes Aim at AWS, AzureThe public cloud is currently dominated by Amazon's AWS, withover 30% of the market- triple the footprint of second-placeMicrosoft Corporation's(NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure. Google cloud is in fourth place, trailingInternational Business Machines Corp.(NYSE:IBM).The cloud is a huge market already and it's expected to get far larger, quickly. Forrester recently pegged the expected value of the public cloud - services like AWS, Azure and Google Cloud - toreach $236 billion by 2020.9 Stocks to Buy That Are Growing Faster Than AmazonAnd Google wants a bigger piece of that pie.At its Next 2017 conference keynote, the company made the case for choosing Google cloud over AWS or Azure. While noting that it has invested $30 billion in its cloud services, the company rattled off an impressive list of companies that haverecently made the move to Google cloud.eBay Inc.(NASDAQ:EBAY) andColgate-Palmolive Company(NYSE:CL) represent the large corporate side of Google cloud's capabilities, while popular apps likePokemon GoandSnap Inc.'s(NYSE:SNAP) Snapchat show off its suitability for hosting consumer apps.Google cloud's head Diane Greene, took the opportunity to fire a shot at Amazon's AWS and the bad PR it's received for large-scale outages. Chances are, you were affected by anAWS issue at the end of Februarythat slowed or took down thousands of websites, apps and services for hours.Greene noted that Google cloud has been recognized for topping all cloud service providers in availability for 2016. She puts that availability level at 99.999% reliability, which is very impressive.It certainly makes a case for switching from AWS.Big Wins for Google Cloud, and G SuiteSeveral big wins for Google cloud were also touted at Next 2017.SAP SE (ADR)(NYSE:SAP) is the world leader in enterprise resource planning software, counting over 345,000 companies as customers. Many large corporations rely on SAP software and it's big enough to be hosting its own cloud services. However, it has signed on for its SAP HANA database to be hosted on Google cloud, instead of at its own data centers.AsTechCrunchnotes,Microsoft and Amazon already had deals signed with SAP. Beating AWS and Azure to host HANA has an even greater significance given that the competition already had an established relationship with SAP.Drop Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock. Here's Why.Also announced at Next 2017 was a big win for G Suite, Google's cloud-hosted productivity apps.Verizon Communications Inc.(NYSE:VZ) announced it has dropped Microsoft Office for 150,000 employees, moving them instead to Google's G Suite.Look for Google to continue aggressively pushing Google cloud services in 2017. The company has been spending big on ramping up its infrastructure, its ""Other"" revenue (which includes cloud revenue) wasup 62% in the last quarterand the majority of its 2,100 hires in Q4 went to cloud operations.As Google cloud's Diane Greene said onstage, ""I think 2017 will be a good year, too.""As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceApple Inc.

The Bull Market Turns 8: These Dow Stocks Led the Way Higher;3/9/2017;"It's hard to believe, but eight years ago today, theDow Jones Industrials(DJINDICES: ^DJI) were below 7,000, and many feared further losses that could send the global financial markets into chaos. Just eight years later, the Dow has tripled from those levels, and the mood going forward is much more optimistic. When you look at what has powered the Dow's advance, the most interesting thing you'll notice is that seven component replacements within the venerable average have happened in relatively short order, and those additions have been major contributors to the gains that the average has enjoyed.makeArticleAd();^DJIdata byYCharts.The key winners in the DowBelow, you can see the stocks among the Dow's current components that have produced the largest total returns for shareholders over the past eight years:StockTotal Return Since 3/9/2009Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL)1,191%UnitedHealth(NYSE: UNH)954%Home Depot893%American Express750%Walt Disney691%Visa(NYSE: V)658%Boeing624%JPMorgan Chase584%DuPont576%Nike(NYSE: NKE)552%Data source:S&P Global Market Intelligence.It's illuminating that the top two returners and four in the top 10 have joined the Dow in just the past eight years. UnitedHealth Group came into the index in 2012, while Visa and Nike became Dow components in 2013. Apple is the most recent company to join the average, getting its invitation in 2015.Note that their late entry hasn't prevented some of these key stocks from having huge impacts on the average. Visa, for instance, has seen its stock nearly double since joining the index as international electronic payments volume has dramatically increased. Economic expansion has helped increase money flows, and Visa's ability to dip into that stream with its global payment network has paid off. Moreover, before Visa decided to split its stock, its high share price made it one of the most influential components within the Dow Jones Industrials, and the overall average benefited disproportionately from its gains than from moves in lower-priced stocks.For Apple, though, the influence hasn't been as significant. The tech giant's admission to the Dow came near its high point, shortly after a 7-for-1 stock split that brought its share price low enough to attract the attention of those who run the price-weighted average. In the following year, Apple lost a third of its value, but in the recent push higher for the Dow to new record levels, the iPhone maker has played an instrumental role, and shareholders have finally enjoyed some of the benefits.Image source: Getty Images.Making the Dow healthierUnitedHealth Group has given the Dow strong performance since its admission in 2012, with its share price more than tripling over that time span. The healthcare industry has seen a lot of change over that period, with the rise and seemingly imminent fall of the Affordable Care Act having presented substantial challenges to the health insurance industry. UnitedHealth has been able to benefit dramatically from going beyond health insurance through its Optum line of businesses, which incorporate pharmacy benefit management and various health-related services to try to get corporate customers to encourage wellness and health improvement practices. These services have helped clients cut their healthcare costs, and they've proved immensely profitable for UnitedHealth in its tenure as a Dow component.Finally, Nike has continued to prosper from the popularity of athletic apparel and footwear, but share price gains since it joined the Dow in 2013 have been more modest, amounting to a roughly 50% to 60% rise.

Short International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) Stock For Free;3/9/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsI have been a long time critic ofInternational Business Machines Corp.(NYSE:IBM). The problem is, for the past 12 months, Wall Street hasn't shared my opinion, and IBM stock has been on fire.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockSo, I recently wrote abouthow to get paidto trade IBM stock. The trade, although not a home run, yielded easy profits.Today, I want to take the other side.IBM stock is near its all time highs, but it's showing a whiff of weakness. With so much uncertainty ahead of markets, I fear downside pressure in the near-term. So consider this short idea more a call against price action rather than company pessimism.By the way, I still don't like IBM's prospects, from a fundamental standpoint. They have failed to adopt their mega-machine of old into the new tech world. The highest-profile IBM focus has recently been artificial intelligence, but that is an old headline.It's taking too long to blossom into a cash cow.7 Stocks That Will Hit All-Time Lows in 2017Assuming that experts are correct with their expectations of big things from artificial intelligence, I can use this in my trade as a fundamental basis for the long-term prospects of IBM. Affirmation to this is the recent headline of IBM's alliance withSalesforce.com, Inc.(NYSE:CRM).Maybe hanging to the coattails of the growth monster like Salesforce could keep IBM's momentum going.How to Short IBM Stock for FreeThe bet:Buy IBM Apr $180/$175 debit put spread for $2 per contract. This is my maximum potential loss. The faster IBM stock falls through my spread, the faster my profits will accrue. I have a chance to double my money.Click to EnlargeSince this more of a technically driven trade, I want to lower my out of pocket risk. To do this I will sell downside risk against levels that I deem safe.The bank:Sell the IBM Jan 2018 $135 put for $3. I need IBM stock to stay above my strike sold or be put the stock. I only sell naked puts if I am willing and able to own IBM shares at that price. The 24% price buffer gives me a 90% theoretical chance of success on this leg.Drop Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock. Here's Why.By taking both trades, I would be getting paid to short IBM through April. Ideally, I need IBM stock to fall past my debit spread but stay above my credit sold. As long as IBM stock stays above my sold put, any premium I recapture from selling my debit spread would be profit. So I can still profit even if IBM does nothing.I am not required to hold my trades open through expiration. I can close them early for partial gains or losses. I only risk what I can afford to lose.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director ofSellSpreads.com. As of this writing, he did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Why You Really Need to Diversify;3/9/2017;"Diversification, and the benefits thereof, is something I have written about multiple times before. Recently, however, I have discovered two pieces of data that really highlight how important diversification is to a well-rounded investment strategy. The numbers are enough to terrify even the most devoted, concentrated investor.Time to diversify?The world's most well-known investors are all recognized for their love of concentrated stock portfolios. Several have even remarked that diversification is a waste of time and the only way to make money in the market is to have a concentrated equity portfolio. This is all well and good, but it is really not suitable advice for the average investor.makeArticleAd();The most famous investing gurus got where they are today by being good investors, but that is not to say there was not a degree of luck involved as well.What would have happened toWarren Buffett(Trades,Portfolio) if hisAmerican Express(AXP) investment had not worked out and the Salad Oil scandal had taken down the company? Or ifCoca-Cola(KO) was hit with such a massive bout of negative publicity it could never recover? If either of these scenarios unfolded, Buffett would not be where he is today.To give another example, what would have happened toCarl Icahn(Trades, Portfolio) if lawmakers had viewed his actions at TWA as criminal and thrown him in jail?There are certainly cases where this has happened, but because the ranks of the world's most famous investors are stalked by survivorship bias, it is difficult to realize that for every one Buffett there are tens of thousands of failed investors.That is why diversification is so important and critical for long-term investing success.Numbers don't lieResearch by Arizona State University finance professor Hendrik Bessembinder shows exactly why this is the case. To try and figure out the average return of single stocks over the long term, he studied the returns of 26,000 equities over the period of 1926 to 2015. Over this nine-decade period, equities created $31.8 trillion of wealth. The shocking thing is that all of this wealth was generated by just 4% of equities; 96% of stocks achieved nothing. Including inflation, the real return on 96% of the universe was actually negative. To put it another way, the average investor has a one in 24 chance of picking a stock that will generate positive returns over the long term.ExxonMobil(XOM) alone accounted for 3% of the wealth created over the period andApple(AAPL) accounted for about 2%.These findings are only reinforced by a report issued by JPMorgan last year. According to the report, titled ""The Agony & Ecstasy: The Risks And Rewards Of A Concentrated Stock Position,"" the return on the median stock since its inception versus an investment in the Russell 3000 Index is -54%.Furthermore, since 1980, 320 companies have been removed from the S&P 500 due to reasons of ""distress."" So, during the past three-and-a-half decades, 64% of the index has been turned over. Based on these figures, JPMorgan calculates the chance of actually finding an extreme winner is just 7%. Since the 1980s, 40% of all companies experienced a severe loss and never recovered.The bottom lineDiversification is not a bad strategy. Some of the world's most famous investors may advocate concentrated portfolios, but as the figures above show, you have to be very lucky to correctly pick a stock that produces positive returns over the long term. The chances of picking a winner are so low it is hard to justify even trying. That is possibly why Buffett advocates an index tracker fund for most investors -- the risk of picking the wrong stock and losing money over the long term is just too high!.Disclosure: The author owns no stock mentioned.Start afree 7-day trial of Premium Membershipto GuruFocus.Premium MembersThis article first appeared onGuruFocus."

American International Group Inc (AIG) CEO Fired for Doing His Job;3/9/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhen a CEO is made to walk the plank under the orders of a big investor, middle-aged men get as giddy as schoolgirls dishing on a Hollywood starlet's failing marriage. The resignation ofAmerican International Group Inc(NYSE:AIG) CEO Peter Hancock, for instance, was cheered in a tweet by investor Carl Icahn, and AIG stock was up almost 2% in Thursday's trade.makeArticleAd();Source:Eflon via Flickr (Modified)Hancock's crime? He let insurance do what it's supposed to. He bookeda $5.6 billion chargeagainst earnings last month, resulting ina $3 billion loss for the company's fourth quarter, because the companies it insured against property and casualty claims suffered losses.That's the way insurance is supposed to work. You bet that people won't suffer the catastrophes their actions could cause, but when those catastrophes happen, you lose your money. Of course, when things work out that way, Wall Street punishes you.Life is as unfair in New York as in Hollywood.Hancock's CrimesHancock's actions were conservative in the best sense. He had previously paidBerkshire Hathaway Inc.(NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B) $10.2 billion to take 80% of AIG's reserve risk against its U.S. commercial insurance exposure before 2016.7 Cheap Dividend Stocks to Buy NowThe reserve charge came to about $1.2 billion per year for 2013 to 2015, slightly more for 2016, and it should set the industry on course to raise rates, and book fat profits, starting later this year, assuming loss ratios return to normal.Hancock called his decision""a dramatic move to reduce uncertainty,""predicting better times ahead. But Icahn doesn't want reduced uncertainty. What he wants is a breakup of the company so it will no longer be ""systemically important,"" allowing it to reduce its capital cushion and allowing him to book a fast profit.Icahn also wanted Hancock's head on a platter, and this is being delivered to him,as soon as the board can install a replacement. Hancock had been named CEO in 2014 to replace the late Robert Benmosche, after running AIG's property insurance unit for four years.Maybe AIG's property insurance pricing was low under Hancock, but in a competitive market you take the price you need to get the business, not the price you want. When investment returns are great (as they have been for years now), a lot of players will take low prices, expecting investment returns to make up for any losses.There is one area where Hancock was charged rightfully.The company's tech platform is a mess, and Hancock took the resignation of CIO Philip Fasano over it early this month. Technology is very complicated, and AIG has generally been late to the technology disruption party.As a result of its IT problems, the physical breakup of AIG will be harder than Icahn thinks.Icahn Bad for the EconomyIcahn's thinking is great for Icahn, but bad for the economy.Breaking up AIG means it can hold less capital against losses, but it makes all the pieces more vulnerable to those losses. Instead of the one big collapse suffered by AIG's dumb bet on mortgage insurance in the last decade, you could have a bunch of smaller collapses caused by rising risks to all insurers from the Trump administration's denial of global warming and its pending military buildup.Sears Holdings Corp (SHLD) Q4 Earnings Beat, But They're AWFULOf course, Icahn is as giddy as those schoolgirls over President Donald Trump.Our Tyler Craig recently called AIG""atrocious,""suggesting an option trade to capture a downturn, but the Hancock resignation reversed the trend. The next leader of AIG is now widely assumed to be targeting a breakup of the company, so Icahn will get his profit.It's just this kind of short-term thinking on Wall Street that has led the U.S. economy to repeated recessions since computing and bar codes made inventory recessions disappear in the early 1980s. We're headed down that road again. Icahn will lead us there.Meanwhile, however, buy AIG stock and take some of Icahn's profit.Dana Blankenhornis a financial and technology journalist.

(NYSE:CAT-Free Report)are sliding, down about 1.5% in late-morning trading after a new report, commissioned by the government, accused the company of tax and accounting fraud,according toThe New York Times.The report, which theTimeshad access to and viewed, though it has not been made public or made available to Caterpillar, focused on the company's offshore tax arrangement, and discovered that the company did not pay U.S. taxes on billions of dollars, primarily from its Swiss units and affiliates. TheTimesalso said it wasn't clear which government agency commissioned the report.""Caterpillar did not comply with either U.S. tax law or U.S. financial reporting rules,"" Leslie A Robinson, an accounting professor at the Tuck School for Business at Dartmouth College and author of the report wrote, according to theTimes. ""I believe that the company's noncompliance with these rules was deliberate and primarily with the intention of maintaining a higher share price. These actions were fraudulent rather than negligent.""A Caterpillar spokeswoman told theTimesthat the company was not provided with a copy of the report, and wouldn't comment any further.For years, Caterpillar has defended its tax strategies, saying what they utilize are practical and lawful among big U.S. corporations; they have also helped save the company billions of dollars. But since a 2014 Senate hearing, Caterpillar's tax strategies have been under the microscope of government investigators, notes theTimes. The hearings found that the manufacturer cut its tax bill by $2.4 billion over 13 years, moving its earnings out of the U.S. and into a Swiss subsidiary.Caterpillar is also currently contesting an I.R.S demand that it pay $2 billion in taxes and penalties for profits to the subsidiary between 2007 and 2012.Apparently, federal officials searched three Caterpillar locations last week to execute a search and seizure warrant, including its headquarters in Peoria, Illinois. Caterpillar said it was cooperating with law enforcement.Multinational corporations like Caterpillar, as well as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL-Free Report) and Pfizer (NYSE:PFE-Free Report), are hit with a 35% tax rate in the U.S., which is much higher than in other developed economies. But, ""they are permitted to defer the taxes owed on the profits generated offshore until they bring those earnings back to the States, a process known as repatriation,"" notes theTimes.President Donald Trump has proposed that corporations with large amounts of cash in overseas accounts should be able to return the income at a 10% rate.Which Stocks are Zacks Experts Talking About?Stocks in today's headlines may be tempting buys, but how would you like a sneak peek at the stocks Zacks experts recommend?

Trade United States Oil Fund LP (ETF) (USO) for Big Volatility Profits;3/9/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAfter lying dormant for months, the volatility beast has finally returned to wreak havoc in the oil pits. TheUnited States Oil Fund LP (ETF)(NYSEARCA:USO), king of all oil-based ETFs, suffered a 5.3% drubbing on Monday, falling to a three-month low on substantial volume.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockLet's not mince words. It was ugly.Joining USO in the hair-raising plunge were energy stocks of all stripes. Some of the hardest-hit names includeMurphy Oil Corporation(NYSE:MUR) andDevon Energy Corp(NYSE:DVN) which slipped 6.7% and 6.5%, respectively. Even the big boys joined the sell-fest.ConocoPhillips(NYSE:COP) fell 3.8% whileExxon Mobil Corporation(NYSE:XOM) dropped 1.8%.Support levels gave way across the land as sellers pressed their advantage all the way to the closing bell.But, do you know who's celebrating the newfound volatility in USO? Option sellers.8 Energy Stocks in Peril as Crude Oil Breaks DownThe oil fund had become boring, really boring. Over the past quarter, USO has been behaving more like an old consumer staple stock. As a result, the implied volatility for USO options has been more depressed than Hillary Clinton supporters after the election. With flaccid premiums, strategies like covered calls and naked puts have lacked any kind of profit-giving pizzazz of late.Click to EnlargeSource: OptionsAnalytixAnd that is what makes Monday a gift from the market gods.See, implied volatility ramped all day long as investor demand for options soared. The implied volatility rank quickly ascended from the low single digits to 25% by day's end. Here's to hoping we see some downside follow through in oil prices tomorrow. Further bloodshed should propel implied vol even higher.And that'll make option premiums even riper for the picking.Embrace the Fear, Queue up USO PutsThere are two ways to view Monday's oil spill. Either it's the beginning of a prolonged downturn, or it's a dip to be bought.Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Is a Jekyll-and-Hyde Trade Right NowAt this point, I favor the latter view. And that means sooner than later it will be time to strike with short puts in USO. Selling out-of-the-money puts lines up perfectly with the dip buying mentality. Not to mention it capitalizes on the now juiced up option premiums.Sell the USO Apr $10 puts for 20 to 25 cents.To further increase your odds of success, consider scaling in. That is, sell a portion of the desired naked puts now, then wait to see if further selling increases the value of the $10 strike puts to 30 cents or 40 cents. At that point, you could sell the rest of your naked puts at a higher credit. This tactic will increase the average credit received, which reduces your expiration breakeven price.The max reward is limited to the initial credit and will be pocketed if the USO ETF sits above $10 at expiration. By selling the put, you are obligating yourself to buy 100 shares of USO for each contract sold if the fund sits below $10 at expiration.As of this writing, Tyler Craig held neutral option positions in XOM.More From InvestorPlace3 Stocks to Watch on Thursday: Snap Inc.

(SNAP)Shares of Snapchat parent Snap Inc. rebounded 7% yesterday after a multi-day slump as investors continue to get a hold on what exactly they think about the new publicly traded social media company. The impetus for the rebound appeared to be a let-up in short sales, which thinned from $300 million on Tuesday to $50 million on Wednesday.Still, SNAP stock is far from out of the woods at this point.9 Stocks to Buy That Are Growing Faster Than AmazonThe current debate being bandied about by experts right now is the lack of voting rights on Snapchat shares. Following the trend of tech companies thinning out the amount of voting power held by common shareholders, Snap Inc went all the way, giving shareholders zero voting power - something that prompted Stephen Isaacs, chairman of the investment committee at Alvine Capital, to tellCNBCthat ""Morgan Stanley and Goldman (who backed Snap's IPO) shoul dhang their heads in shame here. … Isn't that the ultimate example of bubble trouble?""Investor groups are now talking toMSCI Inc(NYSE:MSCI) and S&P Dow Jones Indices - the major index providers - about keeping Snap Inc and any other company that uses non-voting shares out of their indices.

Making ""bets"" on a stock based on its recent percentage moves doesn't make much sense, though, in a raging risk-on environment such as we've seen since last November.makeArticleAd();Over my career, I have found that applying a multi-time-frame approach to stock trading and investing not only allows for better perspective, but as a result, also results in superior risk management - and dare I say ""timing"" of trade entries and exits.I make it a point in this column to often remind ye faithful that stocks are a highly correlated asset class, particularly compared to other asset classes such as commodities. While the price of pork bellies has little correlation with the price of gold, within the stock market, around 80% of stocks tend to rise and fall together at any given time. I point this out because while the year-to-date rally in AAPL stock is impressive and worth respecting until it reverses, there also has been a broader stock market risk-on trade thus far in 2017.More than anything, I highlight this for perspective.When I last discussed Apple stock onFeb. 2following the latest earnings report, I said that shares were reaching a critical technical area of resistance through a multimonth lens. While AAPL has since marginally pushed above this technical area, the tale of two time frames remains.7 Cheap Dividend Stocks to Buy NowToday, I would like to reiterate and update this analysis.AAPL Stock ChartsOn the multiyear weekly chart, we see that Apple over the years has greatly respected its 200-week simple moving average (red), which was a source of technical support in 2013 and again just last year.Click to EnlargeAt the same time, we also see that each time AAPL stock gets overly extended above this moving average, it tends to fall into a consolidation phase. Currently, the stock trades roughly 30% above this moving average; at past extremes, Apple traded as much as 50% above it.From this perspective, AAPL stock could have further to run on the upside.On the other hand, the MACD momentum oscillator at the bottom of the chart has now reached levels that in the past led to some downside pressure.Lastly - and I believe most importantly - the rate of change (i.e., the near-vertical rally over the past couple months) has pushed AAPL stock back above its 2015 highs. While this in and of itself is a positive development, previous important highs rarely if ever are overcome on a sustainable basis until and unless some consolidation near those previous highs has taken place.Apple stock has yet to consolidate. Thus, it likely will find the current upside momentum unsustainable over the next few weeks or even months.Apple Inc. (AAPL) iPhone 8: New Name, Late Release?On the daily chart, we see that AAPL gapped higher again following its Jan. 31 earnings report, and despite already being overbought by plenty of measures, kept pushing higher as the broader stock market animal spirits brought in fresh momentum.Click to EnlargeNote that except for a couple days in early January, AAPL stock has now held above its 8-day simple moving average (blue) since early December 2016. That is alongstretch to be trading above such a near-term moving average. I feel it increasingly begs for some consolidation lower.At the same time, until this moving average is broken on the downside, one must continue to respect the uptrend.Through this near-term lens, if AAPL can close above $140, a next squeeze higher into $143 - $144 looks plausible. Alternatively, a break and hold below $138.50 could set in motion a better consolidation move lower with first downside targets near $136 and $132.Like what you see?

Report: Apple Inc. to See 3D Touch Component Costs Rise for OLED iPhone;3/9/2017;"In 2015,Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) introduced the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus series of   smartphones. The unique selling point for those devices at the   time was the inclusion of 3D Touch functionality. 3D Touch,   according to Apple, allows compatible devices to sense ""how   deeply users press the display.""Developing this functionality was certainlynon-trivial, and implementing it obviously increased the bill of materials   of the iPhone 6s-series relative to the prior-generation iPhone   6-series devices.Image source: Apple.makeArticleAd();According to DigiTimes, which doesn't cite specific sources,   the current 3D Touch solution, which is ""glass based,"" costs   about $9. The report then goes on to say that Apple's   next-generation OLED-based iPhone will require a fundamentally   different ""thin film-based 3D touch sensor.""That different sensor structure is expected to cost ""over   US$15,"" meaning that cost per device goes up by at least $6.Why the OLED iPhone will be so expensiveThe OLED iPhone that Apple is expected to release at some   point soon is expected to be priced significantly higher than the   standard iPhone models. Although some may view this as an Apple   ""money grab,"" the reality is that this new phone is likely to be   much more expensive to manufacture than its non-OLED   counterparts.The OLED displays themselves are likely to be more expensive   than the LCDs that Apple uses in other devices, clearly the 3D   Touch implementation will get more expensive, and I wouldn't be   surprised if the industrial design of the OLED iPhone is just   more expensive to build in general.These costs add up, which means that for Apple to simply   maintain the same gross profit margin percentage on those devices   as it does on its non-OLED iPhones, it needs to charge more.Customers will likely pay for valueThe bad news is that prices for something like an OLED iPhone   are going to necessarily be higher than LCD-equipped iPhones. The   good news, though, is that those cost-adders aren't being   implemented just because Apple feels like making a more expensive   phone -- these are features that Apple thinks customers are   likely going to be willing to pay for.Apple already saw a mix shift up toward its iPhone 7 Plus from   the iPhone 7 in the early innings of the iPhone 7-series product   cycle, likely driven by the dual-camera functionality on the   former. If camera functionality is enough to drive a meaningful   mix shift up, then a better industrial design and superior   display should be enough to drive a large portion of the iPhone   customer base toward a relatively expensive iPhone.Segmentation will be keyWhile I do think there will be many customers interested in --   and willing to pay a premium for -- a more expensive OLED-based   iPhone, there will be individuals who can't or simply won't pay   for all those extra features.For those customers, Apple still needs to put out compelling   new products. Apple is rumored to be updating the current iPhone   7 and iPhone 7 Plus models with superior internals in what would   be a typical ""s"" release. Simply updating the current-generation   phones with better internals and features should drive the value   proposition of those products up while keeping the price points   the same.The point, though, is that Apple will need to be smart about   how it segments its product lines -- it needs to continue to   offer compelling products at familiar price points while   exploiting the latent demand for higher-end, higher-priced, and   ultimately more feature-rich iPhones.If Apple can pull that off, its iPhone business could be   poised to enjoy significant revenue and profit growth in the   coming product cycle -- and potentially beyond.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Investors, Inflation-Proof Your Assets;3/9/2017;"Until recently, investors haven't had to worry much about inflation. Rather, the threat of deflation--persistently falling prices--has been the more pressing concern for several years. But like the proverbial frog oblivious to the rise in water temperature until it's too late, says Russ Koesterich, a portfolio manager at BlackRock, investors are starting to experience a stealthy increase in prices.See Also:Rocky Road Ahead for Bond InvestorsThe consumer price index rose 2.1% in 2016, way ahead of the 0.7% rise in 2015 and the 0.8% increase in 2014. One key reason is the rebound inoil prices, which have climbed from $27 a barrel in early 2016 to $53 today. Housing costs are rising at the quickest pace in nearly 10 years (seeHome Prices Keep Climbing), and medical costs, which had been mostly moderating since 2008, are ticking higher again. Overall,Kiplinger sees consumer prices rising 2.4% in 2017.The new president will surely keep inflation on the front burner. ""Donald Trump has put forward a set of ideas that may involve higher fiscal deficits, a large infrastructure build-out and protectionist trade policies, all of which could support higher inflation,"" says Orhan Imer, who specializes in inflation-linked strategies at Columbia Threadneedle Investments.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');No one is talking about a return to the double-digit inflation of the late 1970s. Interconnected global markets and technological innovations that improve productivity are powerful forces for holding down price increases for goods and services. But that doesn't mean you can let your guard down. ""Even low levels of inflation can be an insidious drag on your portfolio and erode your buying power,"" says Joanna Bewick, comanager of Fidelity Strategic Real Return Fund (symbolFSRRX). Investors who have not done so already should consider protecting against such erosion with some of these in­flation hedges.What to buy. Among your bond holdings, consider adding Treasury inflation-protected securities. The principal value of these government issues is adjusted each month to keep pace with inflation--so yields of 0.4% for TIPS maturing in 10 years look paltry before you add the inflation rate. You can buy TIPS directly from Uncle Sam atwww.treasurydirect.gov. Plan on holding your TIPS until they mature.Investors who don't hold the bonds to maturity or who invest via funds should be aware that TIPS prices, like those of most bonds, fall when interest rates rise--which is what normally happens when inflation is accelerating. GivenKiplinger's forecast for higher rates in 2017, fund investors should focus on portfolios that invest in short-term TIPS. Those funds will yield less than those that own longer-term TIPS, but they will be less sensitive to rate swings. A good choice is Vanguard Short-Term Inflation-Protected Securities (VTiPX) or its exchange-traded namesake (VTIP, $49). Yields for both versions are negative, but the funds should deliver positive returns once the inflation adjustments are made. (Prices and yields are as of January 31.)You can take advantage of the higher rates that go hand in hand with inflation with a floating-rate fund. Such funds hold debt with rates that adjust along with a short-term benchmark. Many of these funds invest in loans made by banks to companies with substandard credit ratings. But with the economy growing, defaults should remain manageable for now. Fidelity Floating Rate High Income (FFRHX, yield 3.3%) and PowerShares Senior Loan ETF (BKLN, $23, 2.6%),a member of the Kiplinger ETF 20, hold securities that are a little higher in quality than some of their peers. If you want to minimize credit risk and are willing to accept a lower yield, try IShares Floating Rate Bond ETF (FLOT, $51, 1.1%), which holds bonds with investment-grade ratings.Stocks will crater if there's an in­flation shock--something on the order of an oil embargo or food crisis--but should beat inflation over the long haul. However, some stock sectors do better with inflation than others. InvesTech Research, a market research firm, looked at eight periods of accelerating inflation from 1950 through 2012 and found that energy, materials and industrials stocks, among the most sensitive to swings in the economy, were top performers; rate-sensitive sectors such as utilities and telecommunications lagged the market. When consumers are watching every penny, ""you want to go with companies that have good brands and a competitive advantage, that can raise prices and make them stick,"" says Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Cornerstone Wealth, based in Charlotte, N.C.Think companies such as Apple (AAPL, $121) and Walt Disney Co. (DIS, $111). Strategists at Goldman Sachs recommend companies with low labor costs as a percentage of revenues; their bottom lines won't suffer as much as those of high-wage firms as pay rises. The group includes insurer Aflac (AFL, $70), food processor Archer-Daniels-Midland (ADM, $44), pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts (ESRX, $69) and homebuilder PulteGroup (PHM, $22).Commodity prices respond quickly to increases in demand when the economy is growing. They're often the first signal of rising inflation, as well as a hedge against it. The downside is their notorious volatility. Commodity prices have been on the upswing since early 2016, reversing a nearly 50% slide from April 2014. Harbor Commodity Real Return Strategy (HACMX) is a commodity fund with a twist. Its managers use some of the fund's assets to buy derivatives that track the prices of oil, metals and agricultural commodities. With the rest of the assets, they assemble an actively managed portfolio of TIPS and other bonds. You can gain exposure to commodities indirectly via SPDR S&P Global Natural Resources ETF (GNR, $43), which holds stocks in the energy, agriculture, and metals and mining sectors.You may be surprised to learn that gold is not the inflation hedge it's cracked up to be. It has outpaced in­flation only about half the time in successive 12-month periods starting in December 1973. Still, if inflation expectations accelerate sharply, gold, which also provides portfolio protection in times of geo­political upheaval, would likely perform well, says BlackRock's Koesterich. Consider putting a small amount of assets in a low-cost exchange-traded product, such as iShares Gold Trust (IAU, $12), which charges 0.25% annually.Real estate is a classic inflation hedge, as anyone who owns a home is well aware. You can also own real estate indirectly, through a real estate investment trust that owns commercial properties. REITs give investors a twofer in times of rising inflation, says Kevin Brosious, an investment adviser in Allentown, Pa. The value of the underlying real estate appreciates along with inflation, while rents paid by tenants rise, too. One fund worth a look is T. Rowe Price Real Estate (TRREX, 2.3%), whose manager, David Lee, has been at the helm since 1997. He seeks REITs that he thinks will grow consistently and that trade below the value of their underlying assets. If you prefer an indexed approach, check out Schwab U.S. REIT ETF (SCHH, $41, 3.3%),a member of the Kiplinger ETF 20. It charges just 0.07% annually.Fidelity Strategic Real Return offers a one-stop inflation solution. The fund, which yields 1.0%, has roughly 30% of its assets in TIPS, 25% in floating-rate loans, 25% in derivatives that track prices of a basket of commodities (split evenly among energy, metals and agricultural products) and 20% in real estate-linked stocks and bonds. The fund's 10-year return of 2.4% annualized won't blow you away, but its four-pronged strategy, tested back to 1973, would have beaten inflation in 81% of 12-month periods.See Also:8 Dow Stocks Raising Dividends for 25 Years"

Strong sales to this client drove sales sky-high   in this report. For the next quarter, the strong sales trend   should continue -- but analysts were hoping for an even sharper   growth spurt.As a supplier of audio chips for iPhones, iPads, and iPods,   Cirrus' fortunes tend to wax and wane with consumer demand for   Apple products -- and with Apple's internal forecasts for the   expected sales performance of future releases. That's especially   true now that Apple has exorcised traditional headphone jacks   from its latest iPhone models, replacing them with a unique   wireless technology powered by Cirrus chips on both sides of the   phone/headphone connection.Analysts were hoping for a much greater Apple tailwind in the   spring quarter than Cirrus' own forecasts could support. I'll   note that Cirrus shares still show a strong 50% return over the   last 52 weeks, handily outperforming both Apple and theS&P 500on the strength of Apple's wireless audio orders.

Apple Inc. iPhone Grabs Even More Market Share;3/8/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWarren Buffett knew better than David Tepper when it came to buying or sellingApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) last quarter.

"The 10th-Generation, $1,000 iPhone Could Be Called ""iPhone Edition""";3/8/2017;"This year is especially meaningful forApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) , as it marks the iPhone's 10th birthday. We've   already seen plenty of rumors about what the company may have in   store -- potentially three different models, including a$1,000 versionwith an OLED display -- and there has been much speculation on   whether or not Apple would use the opportunity to change its   naming conventions; numbered iPhonesstopped making sensea long, long time ago.For instance, the current trend would call for the forthcoming   10th-generation model being named the ""iPhone 7s."" Celebrating 10   years and over 1.1 billion cumulative units sold with something   like ""iPhone X"" also has a nice ring to it, and this has been one   of the more widely speculated names. How about ""iPhone   Edition""?iPhone 7 with AirPods. Image source: Apple.makeArticleAd();An iPhone by any other nameJapanese Apple blogMacotakarais reporting a rumor that ""iPhone Edition"" is being considered   for the high-end model for 2017. The company is reportedly   prototyping various models with different feature sets, some   lacking home buttons, and others using a new glass and aluminum   chassis. Apple might potentially even use white ceramic.This would make sense for a number of reasons. Apple Watch   Edition has always been the company's most expensive member of   the Apple Watch family, even if Applepulled away from $10,000-plus models made out of   goldin favor of an eye-catching white ceramic for Apple Watch Edition   Series 2, which starts at a relatively more affordable   $1,250.Apple Watch Edition Series 2. Image source: Apple.The company notes that ceramic is more than four times as hard   as stainless steel, so using ceramic could bolster the durability   and improve scratch-resistance if it were used for an iPhone.   Speculation of a ceramic iPhone commenced immediately after Apple   unveiled Apple Watch Edition Series 2 last September. Apple   already uses the ""Edition"" moniker to denote its most premium   version (at least if you don't include the iPhone SE, which   stands for ""special edition""), so unifying the branding while   ditching the numbering scheme could go hand in hand.Better be worth itAll of that being said, Apple is still expected to call the   less-expensive models the iPhone 7s and 7s Plus, so maybe the   whole numbering thing isn't ready to die quite yet.Expectations are running high for this year's product cycle,   particularly as shares are currently trading at all-time highs   after a two-year malaise. Shares aren't particularly expensive at   16.7 times earnings and 1.2 times sales, but they're more   expensive than they've been in a long time.If Apple is indeed planning on slapping a four-digit price tag   on an ""iPhone Edition"" later this year (which would bode quite   well for average selling prices), it will need to pack as many   features and selling points into the device to justify that   premium to consumers.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Caterpillar Stock Slides After Report Accuses It of Tax Fraud;3/8/2017;"On Wednesday, shares of manufacturing giantCaterpillar Inc.CATare sliding, down about 1.5% in late-morning trading after a new report, commissioned by the government, accused the company of tax and accounting fraud,according toThe New York Times.The report, which theTimeshad access to and viewed, though it has not been made public or made available to Caterpillar, focused on the company's offshore tax arrangement, and discovered that the company did not pay U.S. taxes on billions of dollars, primarily from its Swiss units and affiliates. TheTimesalso said it wasn't clear which government agency commissioned the report.""Caterpillar did not comply with either U.S. tax law or U.S. financial reporting rules,"" Leslie A Robinson, an accounting professor at the Tuck School for Business at Dartmouth College and author of the report wrote, according to theTimes. ""I believe that the company's noncompliance with these rules was deliberate and primarily with the intention of maintaining a higher share price. These actions were fraudulent rather than negligent.""A Caterpillar spokeswoman told theTimesthat the company was not provided with a copy of the report, and wouldn't comment any further.For years, Caterpillar has defended its tax strategies, saying what they utilize are practical and lawful among big U.S. corporations; they have also helped save the company billions of dollars. But since a 2014 Senate hearing, Caterpillar's tax strategies have been under the microscope of government investigators, notes theTimes. The hearings found that the manufacturer cut its tax bill by $2.4 billion over 13 years, moving its earnings out of the U.S. and into a Swiss subsidiary.Caterpillar is also currently contesting an I.R.S demand that it pay $2 billion in taxes and penalties for profits to the subsidiary between 2007 and 2012.Apparently, federal officials searched three Caterpillar locations last week to execute a search and seizure warrant, including its headquarters in Peoria, Illinois. Caterpillar said it was cooperating with law enforcement.Multinational corporations like Caterpillar, as well as AppleAAPLand PfizerPFE. are hit with a 35% tax rate in the U.S., which is much higher than in other developed economies. But, ""they are permitted to defer the taxes owed on the profits generated offshore until they bring those earnings back to the States, a process known as repatriation,"" notes theTimes.President Donald Trump has proposed that corporations with large amounts of cash in overseas accounts should be able to return the income at a 10% rate.Which Stocks are Zacks Experts Talking   About?Stocks in today's headlines may be tempting buys, but how would you like a sneak peek at the stocks Zacks experts recommend?

Why Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Could Rise More Than 15%;3/8/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsCan anything stop tech juggernautApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL)? With AAPL stock now trading at all-time highs, driven by its 27% one-month rise, investors want to know whether it's too late to bite.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockApple stock, which already ranks as the best-performer in theDow Jones Industrial Average, closed Monday at $139.34.AAPL shares have soared nearly 21% year-to-date, crushing not only all the major indexes, but also the performances of FANG stocksFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB),Amazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN),Netflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX) andAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL).All told, the Cupertino-based tech giant, which has been on a winning streak over the last year, has made investors tons of money with more than 35% returns. And with some patience, there's still at least 15% gains to be had as AAPL stock is poised to reach $160 in the next 12 to 18 months. How's it going to get there?Apple Stock's StrengthAside from the recent endorsement Apple received from billionaire investor Warren Buffett, who revealed on CNBC last week that hisBerkshire Hathaway Inc.(NYSE:BRK.A) (NYSE:BRK.B) conglomerate more than doubled its stake in Apple to 133 million shares worth around $17 billion. AAPL has its iPhone 8 and a host of other tailwinds to propel the revenue higher. Rumors suggest that the tenth-anniversary iPhone, which will feature a new OLED display, could sell for more than $1,000 per device.8 Dividend Growth Stocks Raising The BarAs such, given that Apple, which sold more than 78 million phones in 2016's holiday quarter, has surpassedSamsung Electronics(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) in market share, according to data just released research firm Gartner, the company should have no problems selling the new iPhones and generating huge profits. What's more, Apple has also become more than just an iPhone shop.In its fiscal first quarter, Apple's Services revenue, which includes Apple Music, the App Store, iCloud, Apple Care and Apple Pay, grew 17.5% year-over-year to $7.17 billion, topping forecasts of $6.91 billion. With Services quickly becoming the company's second-largest business segment, Apple appears better balanced going forward. And all of this makes AAPL stock less risky, despite its all-time high status.Bottom Line for AAPL StockWhen factoring Apple's massive cash stockpile of more than $250 billion, AAPL stock - despite trading at all-time highs - still looks like a bargain. Based on fiscal 2017 consensus estimates of $8.94 per share, Apple stock is priced at just 15.5x earnings-per-share, which is about four points below theS&P 500index. Assuming AAPL was priced on par with the rest of the market, the shares would trade today at around $170. In other words, even the a $160 target looks too conservative.As of this writing, Richard Saintvilus did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 Dangerous Dividend Stocks to Dump Now7 Stocks to Buy That Are ALMOST in Buffett Buying RangeThe postWhy Apple Inc.

After all, we are growing more dependent on tech in all aspects of our lives. Yet QCOM stock sporadically suffers major setbacks on inflammatory headlines.

Then, QCOM stock could regather its momentum.Technically, it's currently in a measured run with still some upside potential. In today's trade I am not chasing the potential upside. It's more like I want to profit from the value below.Instead of chasing prices, I prefer selling risk against known ranges. It's easier to know where QCOM stock is not likely to go than to determine its future stock target value. So looking back a few years, I see clear areas of defense. The idea is to sell downside risk against levels that should be defended in case of corrections.9 Stocks to Buy That Are Growing Faster Than AmazonI also would be remiss not to note this: The industry and the broader equity markets are near all-time highs. This adds extra risk since the consensus now is that we're due for a market correction, and soon.How to Go Long QCOM Stock HereThe trade:Sell the QCOM Oct $45 put. This is a bullish trade for which I collected $1.10 to open. The 22% buffer from current price gives me a 90% theoretical chance of success.Selling naked puts is risky, so I only do it if I'm willing and able to own Qualcomm stock at my sold strike.

Charter Communications (CHTR) to Launch an All-In-One TV App;3/8/2017;"Charter Communications Inc.CHTR, the second largest cable MSO in the U.S. after Comcast Corp.CMCSA, has taken the initiative to upgrade its multiscreen app and launch an authenticated in-home and TV Everywhere app called Spectrum TV.This step comes right after the company's acquisition of two big cable multi-service operators (MSOs), namely Time Warner Cable (TWC) and Bright House Networks (BHN), which had boosted Charter Communications to its current position.The new TV app is aimed at uniting the viewing experience of these two big MSOs on a single podium. Interestingly, prior to its purchase by Charter Communications in 2016, Time Warner Cable was ranked the second largest cable company in the U.S. by revenue. Bright House Networks was ranked sixth.The Time Warner Cable and Bright House deals have benefited Charter Communications in terms of geographic expansion and operating cost synergies, which in turn have boosted its bottom line and free cash flow. The recent launch of the new app marks another step in the company's ongoing integration process.The new Spectrum TV app makes up to 300 live channels and 25,000 on-demand programming accessible to customers via Apple Inc.'sAAPLiOS, Android, Kindle Fire, Roku, Xbox One, Samsung Smart TV and at its site, namely,www.SpectrumTv.com. Overall, it combines the best features and functions in a single app, giving customers greater flexibility and more content on a growing number of devices.The new Spectrum TV app also supports legacy Charter Communications customers as well as those who came on board via Charter Communications' acquisitions of TWC and BHN.We believe the upgrade came following TWC customers' complaint regarding Charter Communications' older multi-screen apps' which were not working properly.During the last reported fourth-quarter 2016 earnings, Charter Communications had publicized the completion of about 75% of the rollout of its Spectrum pricing and packaging. The company further expects to complete the roll out for residential customers by the end of this month.DownturnRecently, Charter Communications' Time Warner Cable unit was fined $139.8 million by the Kansas City Court, as a damage recovery payment to Sprint Corp.Sin relation to breaking digital voice telephone services norms. Time Warner Cable was found guilty of intentionally violating five patents for Voice-over-Internet Protocol.Such lawsuits, along with their related fines, act as major dampeners for the company's financials and long-term growth. Sometimes, these charges also affect the company's credit ratings going forward. We hope that Charter Communications will soon recover from the loss it had to face from such fines and  believe that the cable company will henceforth remain aware of all its activities.Over the past three months, we observed that shares of Charter Communications grew 15.84% compared with the Zacks categorizedCable Televisionindustry's gain of 10.43%.Charter Communications currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

For the trailing four quarters, the company has an average positive earnings surprise of 0.29%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderVeriFone holds a prime position in the electronic payment systems and services market. The company is benefiting from the increasing adoption of new payment solutions from AppleAAPL, AlphabetGOOGLand Samsung in the mobile payments industry.The company's strong product portfolio positions it well to gain from the booming payments market. VeriFone Engage and Carbon iPOS offerings are expected to fuel its growth. Also, accretive acquisitions have played a pivotal role in expanding its business.The company has initiated a new restructuring program to focus on streamlining its operations and carve a growth trajectory for the long run. VeriFone started to generate savings from its restructuring activities in the fourth quarter of 2016 and expects it to continue through 2017.However, VeriFone's business has been affected by weakness in the emerging markets. Furthermore, management has given a cautious outlook for fiscal 2017 on account of the shift in EMV deadline and continued forex volatility.For the first quarter, the company projects non-GAAP revenues of approximately $450 million and non-GAAP earnings of 20 centsper share.Verifone Systems, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseVerifone Systems, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise|Verifone Systems, Inc. QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that VeriFone will beat earnings estimates this quarter.

Broadcom Ltd. Expects Samsung to Try to Claw Back Premium Smartphone Share;3/8/2017;"Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO) is an interesting chip company to follow,   particularly for investors looking to get reads on howApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) andSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) are doing in the high-end smartphone   market.Indeed, Broadcom is a key supplier of Wi-Fi and RF chips to   both companies, as well as to other high-end smartphone vendors.   As Broadcom's wireless chip business depends heavily on those two   companies' sales, its financial commentary often includes ""clues""   that indicate that the near-term future might hold for Apple,   Samsung, and others.Image source: Apple.makeArticleAd();One key takeaway from Broadcom's most recent earnings results   is that Samsung is looking to make a serious effort to take   high-end smartphone market share, potentially at Apple's   expense.Apple revenue down, Samsung revenue upApple and Samsung don't launch flagship smartphones at the   same time -- Apple's products come in the fall, while Samsung's   flagship Galaxy S devices tend to arrive in the spring. The word   is that Samsung will announce the Galaxy S8-series smartphones in   late March of 2017 with availability happening in late April.According to Broadcom CEO Hock Tan, Broadcom's wireless   revenue dropped 13% sequentially in the company's most recent   quarter ""driven by the expected seasonal decline in demand from a   major North American customer.""In other words, demand for wireless chips that go into the   iPhone was down as Apple moves past the peak of the iPhone 7   product cycle.For the second quarter of 2017, Broadcom says it expects to   ""hit the bottom of annual product cycle transition at a major   North American customer"" -- in other words, sales of components   to Apple in support of the iPhone 7 cycle will trough in the   current quarter, with sales likely rebounding as Apple begins to   build up inventory of its next-generation iPhones.However -- and this is where it gets good -- Tan says that the   company expects that a ""significant portion"" of the decline that   it expects to see from Apple to be offset by the ramp up of sales   to its ""large Korean smartphone customer."" In other words,   Samsung.To be clear, Tan says that the company still expects wireless   revenue to be down quarter over quarter (so the Samsung ramp-up   won't completely offset the iPhone ramp down), but he expects an   increase in Broadcom chip content inside of the new Samsung   phones to help drive a high-single-digit decline that's ""better   than the typical double-digit declines [Broadcom has] experienced   in prior years.""Potentially more than just contentBroadcom's financial commentary and expectations vis-a-vis the   Samsung S8 ramp appear to be driven more by the content increase   rather than potential market share gain. However, Tan did   indicate that Samsung is trying quite hard to recapture   share.Indeed, he said that Broadcom's ""Korean customer"" is ""coming   in with a vengeance to try to recover share.""Only time will tell how much share Samsung can recapture with   its Galaxy S8 line of smartphones (and if that share gain comes   at Apple's expense or that of other Android phone vendors), but   initial leaks show that the device at leastlooksnice, with a very high screen-to-body ratio as well as   top-notch specifications.However, it won't be too long before Samsung formally launches   the devices and the company gives some indication of the initial   sales velocity of the new phones.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Why Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Is Becoming a ‘Battleground Stock’;3/8/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsNvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA) stock has pulled back sharply over the past few weeks. Nvidia stock hit an all-time closing high of $119.31 on Feb. 8. At that point, Nvidia had risen $370% in just a year, and was up nearly six times in the past 24 months.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockGiven the optimism toward NVDA, a reversal in that trend seemed highly unlikely.Since then, however, NVDA stock has pulled back sharply - in a bull market, no less.Nvidia trades more than 15% lower than it did barely three weeks ago. A modest selloff followed Q4 earnings in early February, despite numbers that came in well above expectations. Since then, a series of analyst downgrades and overall valuation concerns have pulled the high-flying stock back to Earth.From here, the decline seems to make some sense. Nvidia has done a fantastic job of driving growth the past few years. Fiscal 2017 (ending January) revenue increased 55%; net income more than doubled. But valuation matters, too, and NVDA stock had reached at a point that in retrospect looks unsustainable.With Nvidia still trading at 36 times FY18 consensus EPS, there could be more downside.The NVDA Stock Bears AwakenThe first sign that NVDA was seeing valuation questions came after its Q4 earnings report early last month. The headline numbers in the quarter were hugely impressive. EPS of $1.13 beat estimates by 30 cents; revenue growth of 55% was more than four points higher than expected. In morning trading the next day, Nvidia stock cleared $120.The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for 2017: The Experts' PicksBut it couldn't hold those gains; shares wound up declining 2% on the day. Nvidia declined another 7% in the next session, with investors appearing to take profits after the huge bull run.Two weeks after the earnings report, NVDA was rocked by two analyst downgrades:Instinet analyst Romit Shahcut the stockto ""Reduce,""largely citing valuation concerns. Shah pointed to two previous product cycles - motherboard CPU in 2007 and the Tegra chip line in 2011 - which had driven similar optimism toward NVDA stock. In both cases, NVDA multiples had compressed. In this case, with Nvidia's enterprise-value-to-sales ratio having jumped from 2x to 7x in just a year, Shah argued a similar, potentially dangerous, cycle was occurring.BMO Capital Marketsadded its own downgradethe same day,citing a ""perfect storm"" of fundamentals that had driven the stock higher. BMO's target was actually lower than that of Instinet: $85 versus $90. The firm, like Instinent, highlighted valuation concerns, while also seeing tougher competition in 2017.The combination of two somewhat rare ""Sell""-equivalent ratings sent NVDA stock almost 10% in a single day.Does the Bear Case for Nvidia Stock Hold Water?Other analysts have come to Nvidia's defense. Goldman Sachsmaintainedthe stock on its ""Conviction Buy"" list. Mizuho & UBS both responded with ""buy the dip"" arguments. All three analysts set a target price for NVIDIA stock around $130, implying close to 30% upside from current levels.But the downgrades clearly have made a dent in the narrative surrounding NVDA - and with good reason, I believe.Valuation was stretched, with the stock at $120 trading at 40x 2017 EPS even excluding the company's $8 per share in net cash. As strong as FY17 results were, Nvidia still is a semiconductor company. That's a difficult, highly cyclical business, one where growth is difficult and multiples stay compressed.Product cycles tend to limit long-term growth trajectories. Moore's Law - and competition - both mean that prices generally decline over the cycle, pressuring margins and profits.That's why even growing chip makers tend to have low valuations. BothCypress Semiconductor Corporation(NASDAQ:CY) andMellanox Technologies, Ltd.(NASDAQ:MLNX) trade right around 14 times forward earnings.Intel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) is valued even lower, though it has some growth problems. (Instinet analyst Shah suggested investors swap INTC for NVDA, in part due to valuation.)The pullback in Nvidia stock makes some sense, simply from a valuation standpoint. Even NVDA bears are forecastingsomegrowth - it's a question of how much, and at what price.And competition isn't to be ignored. Most notably, in automotive, Nvidia will go head-to-head with industry leaderMobileye NV(NYSE:MBLY).I think MBLY is overvalued, and similar over-enthusiasm may be boosting NVDA stock as well.How to Buy Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock the RIGHT WaySimply put, growth will get more difficult for Nvidia going forward. That's the nature of the semiconductor space. And slowing growth isn't priced into NVDA stock - even after the 15% pullback.How to Play NVDA From HereAt this point, Nvidia looks more reasonably valued - even if I think it's a bit overpriced.A short of Nvidia stock seems too aggressive at this point, to be sure, but a long play might be too early. It seems likely that NVDA will be a battleground for the next few months, with bulls and bears arguing over the outlook. That will drive some volatility, but likely not much in the way of movement.I'd think bulls and bears alike might consider letting the dust settle here, particularly until first-quarter earnings in May. Both sides make some good points, and both sides will continue to make those points.I doubt either the bulls or the bears will make much progress, however, until at least the next earnings report.As of this writing, Vince Martin did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace9 Stocks to Buy That Are Growing Faster Than AmazonIs Caterpillar Inc.

2 New Technologies That Could Power Cirrus Logic Higher;3/8/2017;"Image Source: Cirrus LogicCirrus Logic(NASDAQ: CRUS) paid the price ofdependingonApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) for 85% of its revenue in the third quarter.   Though it delivered a tremendous financial performance due to the   ramp up in iPhone 7 production, a tepid outlook sent alarm bells   ringing. The stock market took note of Cirrus Logic's weak   outlook and its sharesdropped 14% the next day.makeArticleAd();The problem is that Cirrus' revenue is highly dependent on the   iPhone production cycle, which is like putting all your eggs in   one basket. If Apple does not increase Cirrus' content in its   phones or cuts its production volumes, the latter's financial   performance gets severely impacted. Apple is not expected to   bring any new Cirrus technology into its next iPhone.No increase in chip content at Apple is going to hurt Cirrus'   revenue growth. Consensus estimates indicate that its revenue   will grow only 6.5% in fiscal year 2018 as compared to estimated   gains of 31% in the current fiscal year.Cirrus needs the power of diversification in order to sustain   its strong revenue growth and avoid Apple-related fluctuations.   The good news for Cirrus investors is that there are two key   technologies that could help it diversify not just in smartphones   but into other industries as well.Voice biometrics will be a big dealCirrus' research in voice biometrics will play a major role in   its push to diversify itself as this technology, which allows   people to interact with their devices via voice, will find   application in a variety of fields. Voice biometrics has several   use cases, ranging from connected cars to smart homes to the   Internet of Things. The technology is also gaining traction in   the fields of banking and financial services for user   authentication.Infiniti Research forecasts that the voice recognition   biometrics market will grow at an annual pace of almost 19.4%   from 2017 to 2021. This is close to the 22.9% annual growth   expected by Tractica in the overall biometrics market, which   includes other sub-segments such as facial, fingerprint, and iris   recognition.In all, the total biometrics market is expected to be worth   $15.1 billion by 2025, according to Tractica, and voice   recognition stands to be an important pillar of its growth due to   its application across industries. Banks, for instance, are   increasingly deploying voice biometrics. BothBarclaysandHSBCstarted using voice recognition to securely identify customers   last year.What's more, the adoption of voice biometrics in mobile   devices is also expected to pick up pace going forward. Apple   itself filed a patent last February related to   voice-recognition-based authentication. Apple's patent filing   says that:A device can be configured to receive speech input from a     user. The speech input can include a command for accessing a     restricted feature of the device. The speech input can be     compared to a voiceprint (e.g., text-independent voiceprint) of     the user's voice to authenticate the user to the device.Cirrus can capitalize on the possibility of Apple deploying   voice biometrics in its future phones as it is all set to ""tape   out"" its first component in 2017. Cirrus management says that the   company will start sampling its voice-biometrics-enabling   components in the quarter that runs July September of 2017.Cirrus believes that it could start generating revenue from   this technology after the next fiscal year ends. Therefore, it   won't be surprising if Cirrus' growth gets back on track after a   weak fiscal 2018 once it launches its voice biometrics-enabling   chips.Active noise cancellation is a more immediate     catalystTechSci Research forecasts that the market for earphones and   headphones could surpass $19 billion in revenue over the next   five years as smartphone makers try to deliver a superior audio   experience to customers. The use of active noise cancellation   (ANC) technology is one way to deliver an immersive audio   experience.Samsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) , for instance, is expected to sell   ANC-enabled wireless headphones alongside the upcoming Galaxy S8.   Samsung believes that the use of ANC will allow it to cut out   ambient noise by a maximum of 20 decibels and result in a better   audio experience, which will give it a differentiating factor   against rivals.An immersive audio experience, however, will not come cheap as   Samsung is expected to charge 130 euros (or $138 approximately)   for the headphones. Now, Cirrus' first headset with ANC   technology is expected to be launched soon. As Samsung is one of   its customers, it is likely that a Cirrus chip is powering the   Korean giant's ANC-enabled headphone.What's more, Cirrus is already in talks with more customers   for its ANC headsets and seems to have landed a few design wins   already. As the design wins materialize and the adoption of voice   biometrics and ANC gains traction, Cirrus Logic will find new   avenues to augment its growth. Therefore, despite a year of slow   growth in fiscal 2018, Cirrus Logic's long-term prospects appear   to be bright based on the possibilities presented by these two   technologies.10 stocks we like better than Cirrus LogicWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock       tip, it can pay to listen.

Most importantly, the willingness to aggressively push into new territory is encouraging for potential Microsoft shareholders.9 Stocks to Buy That Are Growing Faster Than AmazonInvestorPlace contributor Will Ashworth took this confidence further by declaring that MSFT stock willhit $80 this year. Is this wishful thinking, or is there more to this than mere bravado?Challenges Facing MSFT stockFirst things first - I admire the guts Ashworth displayed. That's putting yourself out there and giving clarity to your point of view. It's something I wish I could see in Washington, but that's a whole different ballgame.With MSFT stock specifically, the bullish argument is an easy one, but so is the cautious approach. Shares have soared despite the wave of competition in the consumer tech sector. InvestorPlace contributor Vince Martin speaks for a lot of people whenhe wrote, ""I continue to be surprised at the strength shown by Microsoft stock. MSFT stock has risen roughly 150% in just four years - despite little movement in profits.""The lack of fundamental growth is even more perplexing when you consider Microsoft's position within the fierce environment. The company is either lagging, or is getting challenged by rising up-and-comers. Martin writes:""For Office 365,Tableau Software Inc(NYSE:DATA) is challenging Excel - and 27% revenue growth in 2016 suggests DATA is taking share from MSFT. Behemoths likeOracle Corporation(NYSE:ORCL) and many others are in the cloud space. Microsoft's Dynamics CRM product is a distant second tosalesforce.com, inc. (NYSE:CRM).""A huge concern for those trading MSFT stock is the market capitalization. I'm not a fan of focusing on any one metric. Still, with its equity valued at half a trillion dollars, you have to take a step back. Is Microsoft stock really worth that much?Click to EnlargeKeep in mind that despite four consecutive years of double-digit growth, the magnitude has also declined. The first strike was 39.5% in 2013, followed by performances of 28.4%, 21.9% and 16.5%.Microsoft Stock Is a Proven WinnerAdmittedly, that's not the direction the trend should go. Nevertheless, I think Ashworth is going to be a happy camper. Like other tech names, Microsoft stock starts off the year fairly slowly. For example, its first quarter returns are a relatively pedestrian 8%.But at year's end, the average return jumps up to 30.7%, nearly four times higher. That also means that those who are concerned about this year's slow start for MSFT stock shouldn't be.The other attribute that is remarkable about Microsoft is its resiliency. Between 2000 and 2011, MSFT stock suffered a negative Q1 performance ten times. But in four of those instances, shares managed to claw back positive returns for the year. That provides a lot of security for those making strongly optimistic calls for Microsoft stock.While investors have reason to look at MSFT cautiously, I think Wall Street is giving Nadella and company a fair shake. They want to see what it can do with its long-term strategy, and the signs are encouraging. A prime example is Microsoft'shigh-profile acquisitionofLinkedIn. By integrating its intellectual capital with Microsoft's vast networks, it can do serious damage in the social media sphere.Snap Inc (SNAP) Stock: Stay Away at All Costs!Overall, $80 for Microsoft stock is very reasonable. Although not dominant, it's competing well in some of the most exciting and high-growth sectors. Both the company and the markets are loving the change in leadership and culture. Finally, Microsoft continues to find ways to do well, even in the most trying of circumstances. The only question is, can I be the first to call $100 in 2018?As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace3 Drug Stocks Hit by Trump's Call for Lower Prices4 Food Stocks at Risk Thanks to Record HeatThe postMicrosoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock Looks Overbought.

The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights: Apple, Pandora, Alphabet and Sony;3/8/2017;"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL -March 08, 2017 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog includeApple's(NASDAQ:AAPL-Free Report),Pandora(NYSE:P-Free Report),Alphabet Inc.'s(NASDAQ:GOOGL-Free Report), andSony(NYSE:SNE-Free Report).Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations.Get #1Stock of the Day pick for free.Here are highlights from Tuesday's Analyst Blog:Will Spotify Stream into an IPO in 2017?Launched in 2008 by entrepreneurs Daniel Ek and Martin Lorentzon, Stockholm, Sweden-basedSpotifyis one of the most popular streaming services on the market today. With its desktop and mobile app version, the company allows users to search or browse, for free, through its extensive music library. Spotify also offers a ""Premium"" subscription for $9.99 per month that removes advertisements and lets users download music to listen to offline.CompetitionSpotify recently announced that it now has 100 million monthly active users, with 50 million paying for the service. This achievement has cemented its status as the biggest subscription music service by user count, and the leader in the increasingly crowded music streaming industry.Arguably Spotify's biggest market rival is Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL-Free Report) Apple Music. Launched in 2015, Apple Music is a streaming music service based on Beats Music, which has drawn listeners with playlists made by experts, not algorithms. The service is also known for its collaborations with high-profile musicians like Drake and Taylor Swift. It costs $9.99 per month, and users can download music from an extensive digital library, just like Spotify. Apple Music offers listeners a free, three-month initial trial.There's also Tidal, the Scandinavian streaming service that rapper and mogul Jay Z scooped up back in 2015 for $56 million. It has a similar price of $9.99 per month for normal streaming, while also offering a $19.99 per month option that includes high-fidelity sound quality. Like Apple Music, Tidal is known for its partnerships with big music names. Rihanna, Beyoncé, and Kanye West all exclusively debuted their latest albums on Tidal before a wider release.Other top rivals include Rdio, which provides access to online radio stations, with different levels of on-demand access, for $3.99 to $9.99 per month; Pandora (NYSE:P-Free Report), one of the original internet radio companies, goes for $4.99 per month to avoid ads; Rhapsody, the original streaming music subscription service, has been around since 2001, and is available for $9.99 per month; and Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOGL-Free Report) Google Play Music, which offers online music storage and a streaming service for $9.99 per month.ControversiesDespite its popularity, Spotify tends to draw out negative publicity, mainly over debates about its free advertising-supported service. This service allows people who are prepared to sit through occasional ads to listen to songs for free on demand. Music labels-Spotify is in compliance with Sony (NYSE:SNE-Free Report), EMI, Warner Music Group, and Universal, among others-understandably dislike the free service because it dismantles album sales, and pays less in royalties than the subscription does.We all remember Spotify's battle with Taylor Swift. The popstar withdrew her entire catalog from the service because she ""didn't like the way it felt. I think there should be an inherent value placed on art. I didn't see that happening, perception-wise, when I put my music on Spotify,"" shesaid in an interviewwithTime.Other musicians soon followed in her footsteps. Icelandic singer Björk made her latest albumVulnicuraunavailable on Spotify and other streaming services, though her back catalogue remained available. And in 2015, British songstress Adele similarly restricted her Grammy-winning album25from all streaming services-however, you can currently listen to it on Spotify, along with her other albums,19and21-on its release date,tellingTimethat ""I believe music should be an event.""Last year, Spotify was embroiled in issues surrounding its updated Terms and Conditions of Use, where in ablog post, the company's user communications manager Candace Katz explains ""We may ask for customer permission to collect information from new sources, such as address book, location, and sensor data [and photos, voice controls, and contacts] from the mobile device to improve the customer experience and inform product decisions.""This unexpectedly caused an uproar, with many calling Spotify's new privacy policy ""eerie"" and ""creepy"" and pledging to unsubscribe from the service. The backlash was bad enough that CEO Ek wrote another blog post, aptly called ""SORRY"" in order to explain that users don't have to share this information if they don't want to. ""We will ask for your express permission before accessing any of this data - and we will only use it for specific purposes that will allow you to customize your Spotify experience.""An IPO on the Horizon?Over the past few years or so, Spotify has been on the hunt for new funding. The company closed funding rounds in 2012 and 2013, raising $100 million and $250 million, respectively. In 2016, Spotify completed a whopping $526 million round of funding, putting it at a valuation of roughly $8.5 billion, a move that showed investors its desire for expansion and new forms of content-a few months before this funding round, Spotify announced its plan to add videos and podcasts from partners like ESPN, NBC, Comedy Central, and Condé Nast.And about a year ago, the company raised $1 billion in convertible debt on the promise that its new investors will receive a 30% discount on shares when it files for an IPO. Spotify will have to pay 5% annual interest on the debt, however, and 1% more every six months, up to a total of 10%, until it goes public.This decision to raise money through convertible debt was a smart move, as Spotify was able to maintain its high valuation without diluting its existing shareholders. It does suggest the company is seriously thinking about an IPO, since the latest round of funding encourages Spotify to go public sooner rather than later.Or, at least, that's what was originally thought.According toTechCrunch, Spotify is apparently considering delaying its IPO to 2018, with sources saying the company wants to use the time to ""build a better balance sheet and work on shifting its business model to improve its margins."" But in reality, the delay is likely linked to Spotify's inability to finalize new licensing deals with the big record labels like Universal, Sony, and Warner, whom control 80% of recorded music.There's no doubt about Spotify's rapid growth and universal reach, but it remains unprofitable mostly because of the fees paid to these music labels. The company supposedly pays a royalty rate of 55% of its sales, and is fighting to pay less. Nevertheless, its impressive valuation-aTechCrunchsource hopes to target a valuation between $11 billion and $13 billion--and popularity will work in their favor when their public debut comes. Patience is a virtue, fellow investor, so sit back, relax, and wait for Spotify's exciting future.Now That Snapchat is Public, Which Tech Giant Could IPO   Next?You may be curious about the buzz surrounding Snap's IPO, but should you buy up this tech stock?

Apple Inc. (AAPL) iPhone 8: New Name, Late Release?;3/8/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsApple Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AAPL) upcoming flagship smartphone continues to be the subject of intense speculation. With the countdown on to finalizing design and starting production of the new iPhone, two details in particular have seen conflicting theories: the name and the display size.makeArticleAd();Source: AppleA new post from Japan'sMac Otakarasuggests AAPL will go with the iPhone Edition - instead of iPhone 8 or 10th anniversary iPhone - for its flagship model.The website also feels it has nailed the display size, and agrees with a previous report that the new iPhone could arrive significantly later than usual.iPhone 8 = iPhone Edition?What to call the new iPhone is actually a big deal this year. The regular naming sequence will continue with the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus. Those are the phones for everyone. But what do you call the all-new flagship AAPL is expected to release -the $1,000+ smartphonethat celebrates a decade in the business (and hopefully helps to propel sales to stratospheric levels)?The iPhone X, 10th Anniversary iPhone and iPhone 8 have been the front runners. But what would you call the 10th Anniversary iPhonenextyear? And iPhone 8 would mess up Apple's naming scheme for its mainstream models.Apple Inc. (AAPL) Can't Commit to HollywoodMac OtakarathinksAAPL will go with the iPhone Edition. The premium Apple Watch model is the Apple Watch Edition, so the precedent has already been set and it would be consistent. This would also solve the continuity problem associated with naming a new iPhone specifically around the 10th anniversary, without messing up the current iPhone naming scheme. iPhone Edition makes sense.About the New iPhone DisplayOutside of whether it would be curved or not, or OLED or not, there have been conflicting reports about the display's size. Most analysts have been calling for a 5.8-inch display with bezels practically eliminated. That would let AAPL fit a larger display into an iPhone that's smaller than the 5.5-inch iPhone 7 Plus.It's a similar approach to whatSamsung Electronics Co Ltd(OTCMKTS:SSNLF)appears to have taken with the Galaxy S8.However,Mac Otakarahas always maintained - and still insists - that the new iPhone will have a 5-inch display. Which seems weird, given the consumer preference for big screens.Mac Rumorsconnected the dotsand theorizes that the information given to the Japanese website is for theusablespace. The remaining display area would be where AAPL has a row of virtual buttons - a feature that has already been mentioned as replacing the Home button and mimicking the functionality of the new MacBook Pro Touch Bar.Take a 5.8-inch display, reserve the bottom of that display for the virtual buttons, and you end up with what is effectively a 5-inch display in terms of what the owner can make use of.The math is starting to add up.iPhone Edition Could Be DelayedFinally,Mac Otakaraagrees with the growing number of analysts who are predicting the iPhone 8 - or iPhone Edition - is going to face a delayed release.A few days ago,9to5 Macreported the iPhone 7s series would go into production in July, as expected. But there are rumors that the TouchID sensor that AAPL is integrating into the new iPhone Edition's display is proving challenging. The added manufacturing complexity may push mass production for the new flagship model to September. That would mean severe supply constraints, including the possibility that theiPhone Edition would not begin shipping until a month after the iPhone 7s, with only early pre-orders being delivered in 2017.If the production issues turn out to be true, the results could be problematic … but not necessarily.Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Is Still ""The One""On the downside, Apple would face the possibility that potential iPhone 7s buyers hold off until they can physically compare it against the iPhone Edition, delaying that wave of upgrades. Potential iPhone Edition buyers could also shrug and order the iPhone 7s instead, not wishing to wait a few months for their new smartphone. And without the 1-2 punch of the 7s and iPhone Edition together, AAPL could miss out on the spectacularly record-smashing launch sales weekend it is gunning for to celebrate that 10th anniversary.On the upside, the annual crest of sales that accompany every new iPhone release could be extended. The iPhone 7s would get the first rush, followed by the iPhone Edition.It's possible.As always, stay tuned. At this stage, everything we ""know"" about the new iPhone is speculation. But with AAPL's supply chain starting to crank up for production, the pieces are beginning to fall into place.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceHow to Buy Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

5 Top Stocks to Buy on the Dollar Rally;3/8/2017;"If corporate executives have been fretting over a stronger dollar, the scenario is likely to take a turn for the worse soon. With the Federal Reserve hinting at an interest rate hike this month and the euro losing value post the French election surprise, the dollar is set to grow stronger.A stronger dollar is denting profits for U.S. multinationals that rely heavily on exports. However, smaller, domestically focused companies gain appeal. Such companies are unperturbed by currency gyrations as they generate most of their revenues from within the U.S.Fed Lending Support to the DollarThe ICE Dollar Index rose 0.4% to settle at 100.28 late on Mar 7. The dollar, which drifted lower in the past two months after hitting a 14-year high in mid-December, is preparing to bounce back. The dollar had already been able to surpass its major resistance level of 100, with several traders saying that such a resistance level has become support.The dollar strengthened against most of its rivals on rate hike expectations. Yellen indicated that a rate hike is in the offing this month with more slated to follow later this year, in a speech to The Executive's Club of Chicago. She said that the ""Federal Open Market Committee will evaluate whether employment and inflation are continuing to evolve in line with our expectations, in which case a further adjustment of the Federal funds rate would likely be appropriate"". The language is similar to what Fed had used in the past to signal at a rate hike. Fed officials, including some dovish members, also reiterated that a March interest rate increase is 'on the Table'.Based on CME Group 30-Day Fed Fund futures prices, which have long been used to express the market's views on the likelihood of changes in U.S. monetary policy, indicate an 84% chance of a rate hike this month. By increasing interest rates, a nation can attract foreign investors who seek highest risk-adjusted returns. Subsequently, there is an increase in demand for the home currency in order to be able to invest in areas where the interest rates are higher.Euro Dips as French Election Plot ThickensWeakness in the euro due to uncertainty over the upcoming elections in France also boosted the dollar. Alain Juppe, the former Prime Minister of the country, confirmed that he was not ready to run the election. This development is likely to boost the chances of anti-European Union candidate Marine Le Pen.If Juppe contested the elections, he would have won the first round, with centrist candidate Emmanuel Macron coming second, which eventually could have knocked Le Pen from contention, according to an opinion poll. Juppe replaced the scandal-hit Francois Fillon as the centre-right candidate.The news sent the euro to $1.0592, down 0.25% from $1.0621 ahead of the Juppe announcement. Markets are also uneasy about the elections to be held in Germany and Netherlands, which constrained the euro despite upbeat economic data across the Eurozone.Who Benefits from a Stronger Dollar?Stronger dollar hammers profits at multinationals. The strengthening of the dollar makes large U.S. companies with significant international exposure bleed as exported products become expensive to foreign buyers. A stronger dollar clearly makes U.S. multinationals less competitive, from technology to energy.Technology is most vulnerable to movements in dollar. A number of big brand names including Apple Inc.AAPL, International Business Machines CorporationIBMand Oracle CorporationORCLgenerate half of their sales abroad. The energy industry is also affected by currency fluctuations and could affect major players such as Occidental Petroleum CorporationOXYand Halliburton CompanyHAL.On the contrary, U.S. small-caps are relatively immune to the dollar strength and stand to benefit.  These companies generate the bulk of their revenues from the U.S. and thus don't have to worry about their products becoming expensive for non-U.S. buyers or foreign exchange risks while repatriating overseas profits.5 Top Domestic Players to BuyAs mentioned above, a stronger dollar has acted in favor of smaller, domestically focused companies. We have, thus, selected five such companies that have a market capitalization of less than $2 billion.These stocks flaunt a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).

Apple Stock Nears $140: Still a Buy?;3/6/2017;"Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) stock has seen a roaring comeback recently, with   shares soaring about 28% in the past three months and hitting new   all-time highs. At the time of this writing, shares are trading   at about $139, well above their price of approximately $110 three   months ago and significantly higher than the low $90s they hit   last summer.With the stock trading so much higher recently, is itstilla buy? This is a good question, particularly following legendary   investor Warren Buffett's recent move toload up on Apple, making itBerkshire Hathaway's(NYSE: BRK-B) (NYSE: BRK-A) second-largest equity holding.iPhone 7 Plus.Image source: Apple.makeArticleAd();Reasons for optimismReinforced byApple stock's 15% rise since its Jan. 31 first-quarter earnings release,   investors seem pleased with the tech giant's performance   recently. The recently ended quarter marked an important turning   point for Apple as it returned to revenue growth, thanks   primarily to a strong iPhone launch in September. The new iPhone   7 and 7 Plus models' popularity have helped the iPhone segment,   which accounts for over 60% of total revenue, return to   growth.Data source: Apple quarterly SEC filings. Chart by     author.In its Dec. 31-ending holiday quarter, iPhone revenue and   units increased 5% year over year as consumers bought up new   iPhones. Apple sold 78.3 million iPhones, generating a record   $54.4 billion in revenue for the segment, up from $51.6 billion   in iPhone revenue in the year-ago quarter. The rise in revenue,   combined with a $1.1 billion increase in its services revenue,   helped Apple increase its total revenue 3% year over year.The return to growth was a promising sign for Apple's ability   to move product. But signs to be bullish didn't end there. Apple   also guided for a 2% to 6% year-over-year increase in revenue   during its second quarter, suggesting the return to growth may be   here to stick around.No longer the screaming buy it wasBut Apple's stock price appreciation accompanying its solid   business performance recently means the stock isn't the solid buy   it was. Indeed, even Buffett seems to be rethinking how   attractive Apple stock is after its sharp increase recently.""I want to emphasize, we have not bought at this price. I   mean, we quit buying when the earnings came out,"" Buffett said in   a recent interview with CNBC. Importantly, Buffett was also   careful to emphasize that Berkshire is ""certainly not selling   either.""Putting Apple stock's soaring valuation into perspective, the   rising stock price has pushed its price-to-earnings ratio from   about 11 one year ago to nearly 17 today.AAPL P/E Ratio (TTM)data byYCharts.However, Apple's pricier valuation today shouldn't lead   investors to immediately conclude the stock is no longer a buy.   Apple stock still trades much more conservatively than many other   companies. For instance, the average P/E ratio for stocks in theS&P 500is 26. Combining Apple's conservative valuation with the   company's recent growth, the stock is still a good long-term bet   -- even at $139.

Spotify Growth Surges Despite Apple, Inc.'s Revamped Apple Music;3/6/2017;"Apple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) launch of its Spotify-like streaming music   service in 2015 was an important move for the tech giant. Not   only did it bolster Apple's services business with a new   subscription offering, but it strengthened the overall integrated   ecosystem of Apple-branded hardware, software, and services that   help customers stay locked into Apple's products.But is Apple's music service failing to live up to its   potential? Spotify's rapid growth since Apple Music's launch   suggests Apple's new music service may not be resonating with   customers the way investors hoped it would.Image source: Spotify.makeArticleAd();Spotify vs. Apple Music: By the numbersApple Music recently made headlines when Apple Internet   Software and Products Vice President Eddy Cue toldBillboardthat the music service had surpassed 20 million subscribers. Cue   also took the opportunity to give the world a glimpse of Apple's   ambition with the service, noting that the company went from zero   subscribers in June 2015 to 20 million in December 2016. ""[O]f   course we want more and we want it to go faster -- we're hungry!""   Cue toldBillboard.But despite Apple Music hitting the 20-million subscriber   milestone, Spotify's March 2 announcement that it just hit 50   million subscribers shows how its service is growing   significantly faster than Apple Music recently. Spotify's   reported 50 million paid subscribers is up from 40 million in the   middle of September. This represents a growth rate of about 1.8   million paid users a month. Apple's most recent milestone of 20   million was up about 3 million users in three months compared to   its last update on its paid users for Apple Music, representing a   growth rate of about 1 million per month.Maybe Spotify is a bit hungrier than Apple?There's no excuse for Apple Music's underperformanceAhead of Apple Music's launch, everything lined up for the   music service to quickly grow to rival Spotify, or at least to   hit a point where it can sustain Spotify's growth rates. After   all, Apple was already a music juggernaut with its iTunes. With   Apple reporting in 2014 it had 800 million credit card numbers   linked to iTunes, the service easily has over a billion credit   cards on file in 2017. Adding to the growing list of reasons for   Apple Music to be a smashing hit, Apple even redesigned Apple   Music ""from the ground up"" this summer in an effort to accelerate   demand for the service. Apple Music should have easily built on   this strong foundation and catapulted the new music service to a   level that threatened Spotify's dominance.Apple Music. Image source: Apple.What's even more concerning is that Spotify's meteoric growth   only highlights how unfortunate it is that Apple hasn't built a   streaming music service compelling enough to keep up with   Spotify's stronger ability to attract new customers. Growing from   30 million paid subscribers last March to 40 million about three   months ago to about 50 million now, Spotify is putting the   spotlight on the strength of the streaming music market.On the other hand, with Spotify's growth continuing to outpace   Apple Music's, this new milestone for Spotify could potentially   serve as a wake-up call for Apple management to begin investing   more aggressively in its streaming music offering. And given   Apple's $50 billion-plus in annual free cash flow, its resources   to invest in its music service are virtually unlimited compared   to Spotify's business model, which has yet to achieve   profitability.But given Spotify's ability to outperform Apple Music so far,   Apple investors shouldn't count on Apple Music catching up to   Spotify.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock       tip, it can pay to listen.

Why Intel Corporation Is Unlikely to Lose the Apple Inc. Mac Anytime Soon;3/6/2017;"Rumors are swirling that microprocessor giantIntel(NASDAQ: INTC) may be on the verge of losing its spot as the   supplier of the processors that powerApple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) iMac desktop and MacBook notebook products.Hypotheses range from Apple's designing its own chip for the   Mac to speculation that Apple will use chips from alternative   processor vendors. However, I believe that based on Intel's   recent commentary at its Feb. 9 investor day, it is unlikely that   the company is going to lose these orders.Image source: Apple.makeArticleAd();Intel's CCG financial guidanceIf Intel were to lose some -- or all -- of the Mac processor   orders, this would manifest as a reduction in the company's   Client Computing Group (CCG) revenue and operating profits. If we   estimate that Apple pays an average of $200 for Intel processors   and related components, then that's $4 billion in revenue that   could potentially be at risk.Put another way, if that $4 billion were to disappear (or drop   significantly), then Intel could potentially see more than 10% of   its CCG revenue vanish. That wouldn't be the end of the world,   but it's the sort of thing that would sting.At its investor day, Intel said that it expects its revenue in   CCG to decline at a ""low-single-digits"" pace -- or an average of   1%-3% annually over the next three years. If we compound the low   and high ends of that range, Intel is planning for between a 3%   and a 9% decline in CCG revenue from 2016 levels by the end of   2019.Here's a translation to hard dollar figures: Intel is planning   for CCG revenue to drop by a total of between $1 billion and $3   billion in that three-year period -- $2 billion at the   midpoint.At the same time, CEO Brian Krzanich said in his investor   meeting presentation that he expects the PC processor total   addressable market to be worth around $30 billion in 2021 -- $2   billion down from where the company pegged the total addressable   market in 2016.Putting the numbers togetherIf Intel expects the PC processor total addressable market to   drop by around $2 billion by 2021 and is planning for   ""low-single-digit"" declines in CCG through 2019 (a $2 billion   decline at the midpoint), then it doesn't look to me like the   company is guiding for significant personal-computer processor   revenue share loss.Now, it's worth noting that forecasts this long out aren't   going to be perfect, but Intel likely has visibility into the   personal-computer design win pipelines at its various customers,   including Apple. If Apple were preparing to shift away from Intel   processors for Macs released over the next couple of years, then   Intel would likely be aware of that imminent shift and should   have included that expectation in its multi-year forecast.Based on this analysis, I don't think Intel investors ought to   worry too much about Apple's switching away from Intel processors   anytime soon in its MacBook or iMac products.Over the long term, however, anything is possible, so Intel   will have to make sure that it has an increasingly compelling   product pipeline to keep Apple interested.10 stocks we like better than IntelWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better     buys.Click hereto learn about these picks!*Stock Advisor returns as of February 6, 2017This podcast was recorded on March 2, 2017.Sean O'Reilly:Welcome toIndustry Focus, the podcast that dives into a different sector of the stock   market every day. Today is Thursday, March 2, 2017, so   we're talking about energy, materials, and   industrials. I am your host, Sean O'Reilly, and joining   me today via phone is Motley Fool senior auto   specialist, Mr. John Rosevear. Good morning, John!John Rosevear:Good morning, Sean! How are you, today?O'Reilly:Extremely well. It's good to hear your voice. It's been   awhile, a month or two, since we last had a podcast, and I   missed you, buddy.Rosevear:Yeah, it's been a few weeks.O'Reilly:I had to get you in here to answer an all-important question.Rosevear:What's the question?O'Reilly:You're the only guy I know who can answer this for   me. I hate driving, I live in D.C., it's very tiring, I   want to know when I'm going to get my self-driving car.Rosevear:Well, it depends on what you mean by get, and   really depends on what you mean by   self-driving, [laughs] unfortunately.O'Reilly:I'm not touching the wheel in my driveway.Rosevear:Let's back up and define some terms here. This system of   classification for things that assist drivers has become   pretty universal. It was developed by the Society of Automotive   Engineers in the U.S. The U.S. government has adopted   it, other governments have adopted it, it's the way all   automakers talk now. They categorize it in six levels that   are helpfully numbered from zero to five. A level zero system,   there's no automation, the driver does everything. This might   even include warning systems like lane departure warning. But,   the driver actually has to do everything. Level one is when   you get some basic level of driver   assistance, assistance that parallel parks for   you, that kind of stuff. That's a level one system.O'Reilly:Does that include anti-lock brakes? I'm surprised   that's on here.Rosevear:That's...O'Reilly:Eye of the beholder?Rosevear:The driver is still executing that. They count that as an   intervention system. It's when the car decides to break for you   that it starts to become assisted. These emergency   stopping systems that they have now where the radar is on   the front of the car, the levels one through five require some   level of sensing what's going on around a car. So, yeah, these   parallel park systems where the car spins the wheel for you and   backs into the spot, that kind of thing, that's a level one.   Level two is where it starts to get interesting. This is the   system where you're on the highway and the traffic jam assist   systems, maybe the earliest versions of Tesla's   autopilot, where you can kind of take your hand off the   wheel under certain circumstances, and the car will maintain and   adjust its speed relative to the cars around to you, and it   will keep itself in its lane. It's doing a little   steering and a little accelerating and decelerating on its   own. But there still has to be a human driver, the human   driver has to be ready to grab the wheel. In fact, a lot of   these systems require you to actually touch the wheel every   minute or two, or something like that. Level three is   when it kind of gets into self driving. This is a system that can   drive under certain conditions, we might say highway   driving, this is where Tesla's autopilot is starting to go,   this is where some of the systems,GM's(NYSE: GM) Super Cruise that will come out on Cadillac   soon, this is where it ends up, level three.O'Reilly:Super Cruise? [laughs]Rosevear:That's what they call it. That's what they've been   calling it for a few years, I'm not completely sure   that's what they're going to call it when it comes to   market. Anyway, the gist here is, it's self-driving until   suddenly it isn't, the driver has to be ready to grab the   wheel. That makes it a little tricky. We'll talk about that   in a minute.O'Reilly:The Motley Fool's Dan Sparks did that article about a year   ago, he lives out in Colorado and he has a Tesla, how   far did he get, 90 miles? I can't remember, but, I   don't think he touched the wheel on the freeway with that   thing.Rosevear:Tesla's official instructions with the original system where   you're supposed to touch the wheel regularly, they considered it   an advanced level two system. I think now they're into level   three territory. The border here is a little bit fuzzy. The   border to level four is not fuzzy. Level four is, the car is   driving itself, period. It does not need you, but it's   limited. Usually what it means is it's limited to an area   that's been mapped, we say it's been geofenced.   These systems tend to depend on very highly detailed 3D   maps that show stuff that normal maps don't show,   like exactly where the curb is within a couple inches and so   forth, so the car can navigate precisely, especially on   a city street. So, it's full self-driving, you don't ever   have to touch a steering wheel, but it only works where the   car has a map. Level five -- and we'll get back to this in a   minute -- is the full-blown thing. It'll drive itself   wherever you want under any conditions. If it's   snowing, it'll go up a mountain, whatever,   anything.So, what we're talking about in the near future is level   four, a car that will self-drive itself. This is coming soon. But   it's limited by its maps. The idea is, gradually the maps   will expand over time and you'll be able to drive --O'Reilly:Are there cities that are being mapped right now? I'm   actually surprised to hear this.Rosevear:Yeah, Pittsburgh is being mapped. This is where Uber is   doing their testing, a lot of it. This is actually where   Ford's new company they created as a start-up with a veteran of   Uber and a veteran of Google's self-driving car project running   it. This is basically Ford's software team for self-driving,   and they're in Pittsburgh. There's been a lot of mapping   done, interestingly, in Pittsburgh, because the   artificial intelligence lab at Carnegie Mellon is the   source of a lot of the research that went into this, so, a   lot of the people are there. There's some mapping going on   in San Francisco. I know GM's   cruise automation subsidiary is doing testing of level   four assistance in San Francisco, so they have mapping going   on. Then, there are companies mapping all over the place. Tesla,   I think, is automating some of this mapping with the sensors   on their existing cars. A company calledMobileye(NYSE: MBLY)  is going to start doing mapping with   sensors on their customers' cars, these are sensors for level two   systems but they can help do the mapping for level four. This is   going to start very soon, probably next year for Mobileye. There   are private companies trying to do this, too, hoping to   be able to sell the maps to the automakers or whoever. And, of   course, the big wild card in this is, of course, Waymo. Google's   been mapping for years and years. [laughs]O'Reilly:You've seen the cars? They look ridiculous, they have the   pole and they have the ball of cameras on the top, and they just   drive around all these cities. That's how I can see what   my dentist's office looks like from across the street.   They're mapping cities with that, too?Rosevear:Yeah. I think everybody is. And it's not just mapping for   Google Maps, it's mapping at a much more fine level of   detail, where is the curb, where is the speed bump, and so   forth, so the car knows what to expect as it's driving. The   idea is, a map is a fallback from its sensors. If it's dark   out, if it's foggy, if the lighter system is   being buggy for whatever reason, you can kind of fall   back on the maps. Because these are safety systems, there   has to be redundancy built in. That's the thinking.O'Reilly:So, when is this stuff coming out?Rosevear:Good question. Tesla constantly does these upgrades, and   they'll break into level four at some point. If I had to   guess, I'd say 2019. But I don't know for sure. They may not   even know absolutely for sure when they'll be ready to ship   it. There's also an interesting question there that with their   owners of their current models, they've been shipping stuff that   maybe has some bugs still in it for the owners to bang on.   And because Tesla owners tend to be early adopter types,   they're mostly cool with that. As Tesla moves into the mass   market with its upcoming Model 3, something else we've   talked about, I don't know if they're going to tighten it up   a little bit. They might. We'll see. But that might push   that data off. But, anyway, this partnership of giant   auto supplierDelphi, Mobileye, which is a machine vision specialist that   has done a lot of work around--O'Reilly:And but they are publicly traded, right? For our   listeners.Rosevear:They are. The ticker there is MBLY. Look them up, because if   you want a pure-play on self-driving, that's as close as it   gets. The third company in this isIntel, which is designing the processors. They're working   together on a level four system. We've talked about this   before. They will have this available to any automaker who wants   it by the end of 2019, they say. Now, the cars are going to   ship in 2019. These things are incorporated as the cars are   developed. So, probably late 2020, early 2021, people   will be shipping cars with this system in, but those cars   may not go to retail. [laughs]O'Reilly:What?! Will they hang out and not do anything? [laughs]Rosevear:Here's what, for instance, Ford is saying. Ford says,   ""We're going to mass produce a level four vehicle   starting in 2021."" Great. Then, they say, ""Yeah, but we're not   going to sell it at retail. This is going to be for car sharing   use in cities and ride hailing services, Lyft and Uber and so   on."" It's because of the maps. They only want to sell it   where they have the maps. CEO Mark Fields at Ford has said,   ""We're not even going to give it a steering wheel in this,""   so obviously it has to have the maps. Again, as the maps   expand, there'll be more. Ford is saying right now that they   think they'll have level four functionality in their retail   vehicles 2025-ish. But they always say that, Bill   Ford, executive chairman of Ford, always says, ""We throw out   these dates, but it's always earlier than I expect."" So,   we'll see. Right now they're saying 2025. So, yeah, he says,   ""This stuff moves much faster than we expect."" There's also   some other stuff going on. The thing to emphasize here, I   should back up a little bit, not all the automakers, not all the   tech companies talk about what they're doing. There will be   surprises here. This is just, what has been announced, what we   have seen, what we generally know is coming.O'Reilly:Yeah, once you go public with something you get held to   it in some capacity, and nobody wants to get egg on their   face.Rosevear:Right. And GM originally said they'd launch Super Cruise in   2016 --O'Reilly:They need to get a different name for   that. [laughs]Rosevear:Yeah, OK. They're a level three system. They came out a while   back and said, ""Wait a minute, we're not happy with it,   we're going to do more work and make it more advanced.   We're not going to set a firm date, but we think late   2017-18, probably around there."" But again, they are   not holding themselves to a firm date on that. In fact,   they're not holding themselves to a firm date on a lot of   this stuff. Mary Barra's thing is, ""We'll ship it when it's   ready."" But what we do know is that GM is planning to   actually start building a whole lot of level four vehicles,   reportedly in the thousands. These will be the electric Chevy   Volts. They will be fitted with prototype level   four systems, and they will go into this massive test   with Lyft in several different cities. So, when will   you get your level four car?O'Reilly:Which is why they invest in Lyft.Rosevear:Right. They own 9% of Lyft, it's something like that.   It's a major investment, certainly, for GM. But, when   do you get yourself a driving car? If you're in D.C., you   might get one in several months from now or a year from now, when   you summon Lyft with your smartphone and a Chevy Volt comes. Uber   is already doing this on a tiny scale in Pittsburgh. They   have 8 or 12 cars or something that are prototype   self-driving vehicles in their fleet. With these   things, there are two engineers on board. One is ready to   grab the wheel and the other one is taking notes on   everything that's happening with the system. And it may be   the same deal with these GM Lyft self-driving vehicles. So   it might not seem all that exciting because there's somebody   in the front seat, but the car is driving itself, is the   idea. This is a way to rack up a whole lot of test miles   quickly, if you have a whole bunch of these things out   there, you know?O'Reilly:Yeah. I can't wait to see all these Lyft driverless   cars handle all the roundabouts in D.C., that'll be a   treat.Rosevear:Yeah, they'll teach them. We call them rotaries up here in   New England, we have lots of them too. It'll be   interesting to see how they handle Boston, which is colonial   era streets in some areas of town. [laughs]O'Reilly:Yeah, they're made for horses, not driverless cars.Rosevear:Yeah. Well, they were made to walk in, or cow   paths, definitely not driverless cars. But, there's other   stuff in here, too. The wild card is Waymo, which is the   Alphabet subsidiary that used to be the Google Self-Driving   Car Project and has now been set up as a company to go into   business and commercialize this in some way. Who will   partner with them? They had this little deal with Fiat   Chrysler where Chrysler built them some Chrysler   Pacifica minivans as test vehicles that took on their   latest prototype system. They've been talking toHonda, reportedly. But of course, there's a certain view in the auto   industry that a deal with Waymo is a deal with the   devil because Google will want all the data. And then you're   an Android phone maker, and Google's making all the   money. That is a great fear. I think every auto CEO in the world   is mindful of the example of the phone   industry. [laughs] They don't want to give up the   data. I think that is actually a lot of the selling   proposition of the Delphi-Mobileye system, this is a system   developed within the established auto industry supplier   structure. We'll share the maps among our fellow automakers   and so forth, but we're not selling the data to   Google. [laughs]O'Reilly:What do you think has been going on there? Correct me if I'm   wrong, but Google has those tiny little white go-kart   looking driverless cars for years. The laymen, we haven't   gotten a hint of them trying to make a buck off of them   at all. It's weird.Rosevear:They hired, a while back, and executive named John Krafcik.   He had been the president ofTrueCar, and before that, he had been in the business for years. He   was with several automakers, in management   capacities, executive capacities. He's a guy who knows the   business, a good guy, smart guy. His job is to lead Waymo and   find a way to bring this stuff to market somehow. He's been out   there talking to automakers. He actually did a really big   presentation at the North American International Auto Show   in Detroit in January -- I was going to say last month,   but it's March now. He was talking about where their system   is and so forth. They have a solid prototype level four   system. I think he was there, in part, fishing for   automakers who might want to have conversation. It's   possible those conversations have happened and nobody   is talking about them. The ones that have made it into the   media are Honda and, of course, Fiat Chrysler, which is   a much more overt thing, because the latest test vehicles   are all Chryslers.O'Reilly:We don't have this as a note, so feel free to tell me   you don't know a ton about this, but I'm sure all of our   listeners are on the tip of their tongues with this, they   want to hear, what is Apple up to? They have that big   plan, and I've got a push notification fromThe Wall Street Journala year ago that Apple was going to build a car within   the decade, blah blah, then they pulled back on it, they're doing   testing again. What is Tim Cook scheming right now?Rosevear:Good question. Yeah, I remember when thatWall Street Journalthing came out.O'Reilly:You got the notification too, I'm sure.Rosevear:I did, and I actually poked a few sources and ended up   writing a big piece for The Motley Fool first thing on   Saturday morning after that broke, sort of, what does this   mean, can they actually do it, that kind of thing. And the   answer was, Apple has so much money that, of course, they   could start a car company, the question is, do they want   to?O'Reilly:Yeah, I remember you talking about that.Rosevear:Right. They can throw money at it. The full boat, it's about $10   billion to get to where Tesla is where they have a factory   and they're banging out cars and it's really high level of   quality and so forth. Full boat. That's Tim Cook's lunch   money these days. [laughs] Their cash load is   unbelievable. They can do anything. The question is, would   they want to? The margins in the car business, by   Apple's standards, are pretty lousy. A luxury car   business might make an operating margin of 10-12%. If   you're Porsche, you might make 16%. That's kind of the upper   limit.O'Reilly:So, is it possible that Google and Apple wind   up dropping the brains in these cars and calling it a day?   Google already, they must have tons of data on these cars   operating.Rosevear:Google has made it clear, John Krafcik came out and said,   ""We're not building cars, we're not going to build a   car factory, we are not building cars. We're looking for   partnerships, we are not building cars."" Apple hasn't said   anything, of course. Officially, this program doesn't even exist.   But the word was, a lot of the people who might have been on   the actual build-a-car side of the business have been let go.   People working on electric self-driving cars are in very hot   demand these days. So, none of these people are wanting for   employment. But it was thought that a lot of those folks   were let go, and they really ratcheted down the ambitions of   the program. They may be aiming to do something where they come   out, like Waymo, and offer a system that Apple-izes a self   driving car built by somebody else. It's possible that they   will find an automaker to partner with, and maybe offer that as a   deluxe ride hailing option. My thought when they were   originally talking about this was that they were going to build   the deluxe Apple version of robot Uber, where it's a little   bit more money but it's a nicer car, and it recognizes all   your Apple devices and it's this seamless experience, it sees   your iPhone and it automatically sets your seat and   your climate and your music and everything else and all this   stuff, it takes exactly where you want to go, and it's   just a subscription model, $500 a month for the Apple Car   service. That's where I thought they were going to go.   Others disagreed. Some of my fellow Fools who are also very close   watchers of this kind of technology and particularly   close watchers of Apple thought they might actually build a car   for retail Tesla-style.O'Reilly:Cool. We're about out of time, John. I want to give you   the last word. When am I magically going to get   my driverless car in my driveway?Rosevear:If you want a Tesla, you might get it by the end of the   decade. If you want a car from one of the bigger automakers,   it's probably a few years beyond that. Somebody may surprise   us and have a level four car out by 2020 or 2021 that has a   fairly big map. But I'm thinking it might be over the next   couple years after that that these start to be available for   retail. I suspect the first ones that come out, it will be an   expensive option on a luxury car.O'Reilly:Awesome. John, I cannot thank you enough, once again,   for your time.Rosevear:It's always a pleasure.O'Reilly:I have to imagine that as this continues to ramp   up, this will not be our last show about this topic.Rosevear:Oh, heavens no. We'll be talking about this for several   years to come. It's a big deal.O'Reilly:Awesome. Well, have a good day, John! Thank you,   again!Rosevear:All right. Take care, Sean!O'Reilly:Bye.

Should Qualcomm Inc. Worry About Xiaomi's New Chips?;3/6/2017;"Mobile chipmakerQualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM) and Chinese smartphone giantXiaomiare often considered close partners. Qualcomm became one of   Xiaomi's earliest investors in 2011, and all of Xiaomi's flagship   devices use Qualcomm chips. When regulatory troubles in China   forced Qualcomm to renegotiate its licensing terms with OEMs,   Xiaomi was one of the first companies tosign a new dealwith the chipmaker.However, that alliance gradually weakened. Xiaomi eventually   started using moreMediaTek(NASDAQOTH: MDTKF) chips in its cheaper devices, and    ongoing rumors indicated that the company was developing   first-party chips. Those rumors were finally confirmed in late   February, when Xiaomi unveiled the Surge S1 chip for its new   mid-range Mi 5c smartphone.Xiaomi's Mi5c. Image source: Xiaomi.makeArticleAd();The Surge S1 is a 28nm chip with eight cores, four of which   run at 2.2GHz with another four running at 1.4GHz. Its Mali T-860   MP4 GPU is capable of playing 4K videos. Those specs make it   slightly more  powerful than Qualcomm's Snapdragon 625, a   popular octa-core processor which powers mid-range devices like   the international variant of Xiaomi's Mi Note 4. The S1 was   produced by Xiaomi's subsidiary Pinecone Electronics via a   partnership with Chinese chipmakerLeadcore.Why Xiaomi needed to make its own chipsBack in 2014, Xiaomi became the biggest smartphone maker in   China. But by the end of 2016, it had dropped to fifth place   afterOppo,Huawei,Vivo, andApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) , in that order. That decline was caused by   competitors flooding the market with comparably priced phones, a   shift in consumer tastes toward pricier devices, and an overall   slowdown across the Chinese smartphone market.Last November, Xiaomi admitted that its  core phone   business wasn't profitable. In January, it stopped disclosing   annual shipment  figures and abruptly announced that it   would skip this year's Mobile World Congress. Those moves all   indicated that the company was struggling to stay afloat in the   crowded Chinese market.However, Xiaomi also noticed that it could follow Apple,   Huawei, andSamsung's(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) lead and develop first-party ARM chips.   Producing first-party chips is a pricey investment, but it's a   smart long-term play because it reduces Xiaomi's dependence on   chipmakers like Qualcomm, cuts production costs, tightens up the   supply chain, and gives it full control over the hardware and the   software -- which could better optimize its devices for Xiaomi's   MIUI custom Android OS.Xiaomi's Mi Air Purifier. Image source: Xiaomi.In addition to lowering costs and boosting performance, IDC   analyst Bryan Ma also noted that Xiaomi's first-party chips could   work better with its smart home ecosystem, which already includes   air purifiers, bathroom scales, lights, and even rice cookers.   Xiaomi could also use its first-party chips to bypass a ban on   MediaTek chips in India, which occurred due to a patent dispute   withEricsson.What this means for QualcommXiaomi's introduction of first-party chips isn't good news for   Qualcomm, but there's no indication that Xiaomi will stop using   Qualcomm chips altogether. The Mi 5c merely represents the budget   device of its flagship Mi 5 family -- which includes the original   Mi 5, the Mi 5S, and the Mi 5S Plus. All three of the other Mi 5   devices use Qualcomm chips.Therefore, the Surge S1 could actually hurt MediaTek -- which   supplies Xiaomi with chips for variants of its low and mid-range   devices -- instead of Qualcomm. If the Surge S1 becomes Xiaomi's   official mid-range chipset, it could stop using MediaTek chips as   Qualcomm chips remain in high-end devices.Qualcomm's Snapdragon could lose its spot in mid-range devices   like the Mi Note 4, but the overall impact on its chipmaking   business might be minimal. Xiaomi's global market share is   already likely below 5%, based on IDC estimates, and could   continue fading as Oppo, Huawei, and Vivo launch new devices.   SincesomeOppo, Huawei, and Vivo devices use Qualcomm chips, higher sales   at those leading brands could easily offset any design losses at   Xiaomi.So should Qualcomm investors be worried?If Xiaomi had revealed the Surge S1 back in 2014, then swapped   out all Qualcomm chips with its own silicon, I think investors   would have been worried. But Xiaomi is merely aiming its new   chips at the mid-range market today, and any losses from Xiaomi   could probably be offset by higher sales of other rival Android   devices.Therefore, investors shouldn't consider Xiaomi's announcement   to be a major blow to Qualcomm on its own. Nonetheless, the   overall trend is worrisome, because it indicates that Qualcomm's   chipmaking business -- which posted flat year-over-year sales   growth last quarter -- will likely continue ceding market share   to first-party ARM chips for the foreseeable future.10 stocks we like better than QualcommWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Apple Inc. (AAPL) Can’t Commit to Hollywood;3/7/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsRumors abounded last week as two executives fromApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) were involved in a series ofclosed-door discussionsin Hollywood, involving some high-ranking TV and film producers.makeArticleAd();Source: AppleWhile few details of those meetings have been made public, journalists and analysts alike have speculated about a range of possibilities, including everything from a massive effort to make Apple TV a legitimate player in the streaming arena, to acquisition and partnership negotiations.Eddy Cue, Apple's Senior Vice President of Internet Software and Services, held meetings last week with executives from various film studios, including Sony Pictures Entertainment, the cinema division ofSony Corp (ADR)(NYSE:SNE), and Paramount Pictures Corporation, a subsidiary ofViacom, Inc.(NASDAQ:VIAB).Apple's Endeavors in Hollywood Are UnclearBecause last week's meetings between Cue and film studio execs remain under wraps, the rumors regarding Apple's future in the movie business are just speculation at this point. But those guesses aren't mere shots in the dark, though, and many analysts have been taking cues from Apple's previous industry activity.For instance, theFinancial Timesreported last month that Apple""has considered a range of acquisitions and targets including, most recently, Imagine Entertainment.""That deal ultimately fell through, however, leaving Apple still waiting in the wings for a suitable cinematic opportunity.10 Super-Safe Dividend Growth Stocks to Buy TodaySome speculated that Apple was considering an outright acquisition ofNetflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX), but the outlay that would have been required was seemingly too great to even consider.But Apple isn't entirely absent from the television arena, as the company has plans underway to produce""an abundance of original TV content exclusively for Apple TV, expected to debut this year.""Plus, the company is reportedly attempting to create a hybrid service that ties together Apple Music and Apple TV, though many analysts are concerned that such a service wouldnot perform wellin today's entertainment marketplace.PatentlyAppleopined, ""The market is going to be so saturated with new TV services that Apple will have to do something rather dramatic for their new hybrid service to stand out,"" but ""Apple TV's greatness has always been 'just around the corner' and hasneverreally materialized .""What's confusing to some AAPL stock investors, though, is Apple's seemingly mixed signals regarding the company's intentions for the streaming movie and television space. One one hand, Senior VP Cue has clearly stated,""We're not trying to compete with Netflix or compete with Comcast.""CEO Tim Cook purportedlyverified the company's current lack of direction, stating:""In terms of original content, we've put our toe in the water doing some original content for Apple Music, and that will be rolling out throughout the year. We're learning from that and we'll go from there.""However, considering both last week's meetings with top Hollywood film studio executives and the failed takeover negotiations with Imagine Entertainment, it certainly does look like Apple is trying its hardest to break into the streaming media niche. In fact, longtime Apple stock analyst Gene Munster predicted thatApple will win an Oscar within the next five years.What This Means for AAPL StockAll things considered, with the current state of affairs regarding Apple TV, original content production and Hollywood film studio acquisitions, there hasn't been much that's legitimately concrete.5 Value Traps Every Investor Must Steer Clear FromSure, if we were talking about any other company, this myriad of rumors and speculation combined with executive statements to the contrary could be enough to cause some wild swings in stock prices. But, for AAPL stock, this doesn't even move the needle.The company has so many other revenue streams and products on which to focus that its film and TV floundering have basically gone unnoticed. Apple stock investors have been hearing about the upcoming Apple TV revolution for years, but nothing has materialized.This current buzz of activity may have caught the attention of some, but until - or unless - management officially announces something groundbreaking, AAPL stock will remain unaffected.As of this writing, Greg Gambone did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace7 Stocks to Buy That Are ALMOST in Buffett Buying RangeApple Inc.

The New Fitbit Alta HR Isn’t Enough to Break the Fitbit Inc (FIT) Slump;3/7/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFitbit Inc(NYSE:FIT) has had a rough year already. Sales have been down significantly as it gets squeezed between increasingly fitness-focused smartwatches on the high end and cheap fitness trackers from China on the low end. Making matters worse, its core U.S. market is reaching saturation. As a result Fitbit stock is down nearly 20% since the start of 2017 and over 85% since its all time high in July, 2015.makeArticleAd();Source: FitbitThe company just announced a new Fitbit Alta HR activity tracker, but is adding heart rate monitoring to an existing fitness bracelet (and boosting the price) going to help turn things around for FIT stock?Fitbit Alta HRYesterday, Fitbit announced theFitbit Alta HR. The company followed the same basic strategy it used with last year's Charge 2: Take an existing fitness tracker and add heart rate monitoring.In this case, the Alta - FIT's fitness bracelet aimed at more fashion-conscious consumers - was updated with the company's PurePulse heart rate sensor. FIT is billing it as ""the world's slimmest fitness wristband with continuous heart rate."" The new version is also more expensive: $149.95 compared to $129.95 for the original.This price point makes the new Fitbit tracker the exact same price as the Charge 2. Both offer pretty much the same features, including heart rate monitoring and the ability to switch bands for different looks. The primary difference between the two (besides a slimmer form factor) appears to be that the Alta HR lacks the Charge 2's ability to use a connected smartphone's GPS. However, the new Fitbit offers superior battery life to the Charge 2, with a claimed 7-days between charges instead of 5-days.7 Stocks That Will Hit All-Time Lows in 2017FIT's Challenging YearThe trouble for Fitbit stock actually started in earnest as 2016 began to wind down.The company faced a litany of problems, including production issues with its latest models and ongoing legal issues with rivalJawbone.Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) released the Apple Watch Series 2 in September, adding an even greater focus on fitness. AAPL lowered the price of the original Apple Watch, making it more tempting to customers who had been considering a new Fitbit because the smartwatch was too expensive. The icing on the cake was Apple'sNike Inc(NYSE:NKE) partnership that resulted in theApple Watch Nike+fitness smartwatch, which arrived just in time to tempt holiday shoppers.FITbought the IP from struggling smartwatch pioneer Pebblein December, but that move has not had any material impact on on its product line as yet. If anything, the move angered Pebble fans.In the latest bit of bad news for Fitbit stock, a report for Q4 wearable sales showsApple hit a new record with the Apple Watch, while China'sXiaomisaw its fitness tracker sales grow 96.2% year-over-year. FIT had a rough quarter, with sales down 22.7%.Are Products Like the Fitbit Alta HR the Answer?In its quarterly report on wearables,IDC summarized the challenges FIT faces:""However, the company also faced one of its largest declines ever as it remained heavily focused on the U.S., a market that is quickly approaching saturation for fitness trackers. Though the company has grown in other parts of the world, it also remained challenged as low-cost competitors eat away at Fitbit's market share.""The Fitbit Alta HR is without a doubt a good fitness tracker. But is heart rate monitoring a big enough new feature to convince Alta owners to upgrade? For those looking for a first fitness tracker (in this increasingly saturated U.S. market), the identically priced Charge 2 makes for a confusing choice.Apple Inc. Fesses Up to iPhone 6 Battery Issue, Releases FixFor those who want a fitness tracker without spending $150,Xiaomi's MI Band 2, which offers the same basic features as the new Fitbit, including heart rate monitoring, OLED display, sleep tracking, smart phone alerts and interchangeable bands - goes for under $30. Clearly FIT won't sell many of its new Fitbit trackers in China and online retailers are selling cheap MI Bands to U.S. buyers as well.In other words, the Fibit Alta HR isn't likely to do much to turn around Fitbit's fortunes. If the company is able to integrate that Pebble know-how it acquired into a device that satisfies its hardcore user base while attracting potential smartwatch buyers - something the Fitbit Blaze has struggled to do - then it might be on to something.For now, it seems like FIT is treading water.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceWWDC 2017: Here's What Apple Inc.

Why Home Depot Inc (HD) Stock Is Perfect for Income Investors;3/7/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSinceHome Depot Inc(NYSE:HD) ""crushed"" earnings estimates on Feb. 21, you would think the HD stock price would be rocketing upward, right?makeArticleAd();Source:Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified)Wrong.Home Depot stock starts Mar. 7 lower than it did immediatelyafter reporting those results: Net earnings of $1.74 billion - $1.44 per share - on revenue of $22.21 billion, a 5.8% year-over-year sales increase. This handily beat estimates of $1.35 per sharein earnings.The company also set a $15 billion HD stock repurchase plan and hiked the dividend from 69 cents per share to 89 cents.The market's reaction? Mostly yawns.You can argue that the reason for that is market anticipation of a good report. Home Depot stock is up 9.7% for the year, and 17% over the last 12 months.7 Stocks to Buy That Are ALMOST in Buffett Buying RangeBut I think something else is going on with HD stock … I think the nature of the company's investment case is changing.HD Stock: From Capital Gains to YieldThe company was founded in 1978, around the time ofApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL), and since coming public in 1981 it has had an Apple-like trajectory. Home Depot stock has split nine times in those 36 years, and a dollar invested at the IPO is now worth over $420,000.This is why co-founder Bernie Marcus could build his hometown of Atlanta a giant aquarium and still be worth$4.1 billion, while his partner, Arthur Blank, could buy the Atlanta Falcons and be worth$3.4 billion. The company has about 2,200 stores and dominates its market.But there is a natural limit to the middle of the home improvement market, as there isn't (yet) in the device-and-cloud business. With fiscal 2017 sales of over $94 billion, Home Depot is bumping up against those limits. Growth has slowed to a steady $5 to $6 billion in sales each year, net income is level at about 8% of sales.The company's board has been doing the wise and natural thing: They're sharing the wealth with shareholders. The dividend was 29 cents per share five years ago, and will now be 89 cents when it is paid out later this month. That's a huge increase, and income investors who bought HD stock in 2012 at about $48 per share are now earning $3.56 per share on that money.Don't let the current yield of 2.42%, based on the Home Depot stock price of $147, fool you. This is a yield play - not a growth play - for the future.HD's Changing PerformanceYield investors are not like growth investors.When you are looking for income, an income investor won't watch the daily averages the way a growth investor would. So long as the dividend is rising, or just staying level, an income investor will hang on until death or taxes.Snap Inc (SNAP) Stock: Stay Away at All Costs!One result is that yield plays tend to be less volatile stocks than growth plays, and the volatility becomes more predictable and more seasonal.This can be seen instories about Home Depot options.Options can deliver big returns on tiny changes in a stock's price, and a regular pattern helps.The pattern for HD stock indicates that some backing-and-filling is due following earnings, and that's precisely what is happening. The recent price action, in other words, is predictable.Bottom Line on Home Depot StockDoes this mean HD stock is no longer a great stock? For a growth investor, as I have been, there are better investments, and I sold out my position a few months ago, at a fat profit.On the other hand, if you are an income investor and if you're retired and need to make money on your money to live out your days in comfort, then Home Depot stock is a great investment for you. As is often said in Atlanta, that 2.42% yield is going to rise-up over time, as the company continues to share its profits with you.Dana Blankenhornis a financial and technology journalist.

iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology Index (ETF) (IBB) Is at a Crossroads;3/7/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBiotechnology stocks - as represented by theiShares Nasdaq Biotechnology Index (ETF)(NASDAQ:IBB) - have rallied 13% year-to-date. That's notable considering that over the past 12 months, the IBB ETF has ""only"" rallied by about 14%.makeArticleAd();Many traders in recent days have pointed to the continued strength in biotech stocks as a sign that the broader market is not yet ready to roll over. But it is notable that the IBB, as a result of the recent rally, has now reached an important technical level on the charts that may offer better technical resistance.A simple yet effective ""trick"" that I repeatedly use to gauge the internal strength of the broader stock market is by checking the pulse of the so called ""risk-on"" groups. While these groups change over the years, they often include technology and financial stocks. In recent years, biotech, tech as a whole and small-cap stocks, among others, have led the risk-on pack.Over the past few weeks, biotech stocks and the IBB ETF have showed both absolute and relative strength versus the broader stock market. Through this lens, one could argue that it is premature to get too defensive on the stock market in the near-term and possibly the intermediate-term until biotech stocks begin to back off some.When I last discussed the state of biotech stocks onFeb. 1, I offered that the IBB's bullish reversal from Jan. 31 could be the beginning of a next swing higher with price targets in the $285-$290 area. Two weeks later, the upper end of this price target had been reached, and last week the IBB ETF further extended this rally into the $300 level.7 Stocks That Will Hit All-Time Lows in 2017Now, let's look at the charts.IBB ETF ChartsOn the multiyear weekly chart, we see that this recent rally has brought the IBB back to the very upper end of a sideways channel, which now also lines up with the 100-week simple moving average (blue).Click to EnlargeThis confluence of technical resistance around the $300 area could provide a more meaningful challenge to be overcome.On the daily chart, we see that last week, the IBB already marginally pushed above previous horizontal technical resistance from August and September 2016.Click to EnlargeMoreover, we can see that over the past few trading days, the IBB ETF has been consolidating in a narrow range right at (or marginally above) those August and September 2016 highs.At this juncture, biotech's path of least resistance on the daily chart - despite the bigger technical resistance from the first chart above - continues to point higher.Here's Why GoPro Inc. Stock (GRPO) CrashedNote also that the 50-, 100- and 200-day moving averages are also now beginning to curl higher again. Considering that price action is the ultimate arbiter, however, I believe the IBB (from a trading perspective) must now be able to clear above $302.50 for a next move toward $312 and possibly $315 to stand a better chance.As usual, any bearish reversal would serve as a stop-loss signal on swing trading longs.Like what you see?

Apple Stock Nears $140: Still a Buy?;3/6/2017;"Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) stock has seen a roaring comeback recently, with   shares soaring about 28% in the past three months and hitting new   all-time highs. At the time of this writing, shares are trading   at about $139, well above their price of approximately $110 three   months ago and significantly higher than the low $90s they hit   last summer.With the stock trading so much higher recently, is itstilla buy? This is a good question, particularly following legendary   investor Warren Buffett's recent move toload up on Apple, making itBerkshire Hathaway's(NYSE: BRK-B) (NYSE: BRK-A) second-largest equity holding.iPhone 7 Plus.Image source: Apple.makeArticleAd();Reasons for optimismReinforced byApple stock's 15% rise since its Jan. 31 first-quarter earnings release,   investors seem pleased with the tech giant's performance   recently. The recently ended quarter marked an important turning   point for Apple as it returned to revenue growth, thanks   primarily to a strong iPhone launch in September. The new iPhone   7 and 7 Plus models' popularity have helped the iPhone segment,   which accounts for over 60% of total revenue, return to   growth.Data source: Apple quarterly SEC filings. Chart by     author.In its Dec. 31-ending holiday quarter, iPhone revenue and   units increased 5% year over year as consumers bought up new   iPhones. Apple sold 78.3 million iPhones, generating a record   $54.4 billion in revenue for the segment, up from $51.6 billion   in iPhone revenue in the year-ago quarter. The rise in revenue,   combined with a $1.1 billion increase in its services revenue,   helped Apple increase its total revenue 3% year over year.The return to growth was a promising sign for Apple's ability   to move product. But signs to be bullish didn't end there. Apple   also guided for a 2% to 6% year-over-year increase in revenue   during its second quarter, suggesting the return to growth may be   here to stick around.No longer the screaming buy it wasBut Apple's stock price appreciation accompanying its solid   business performance recently means the stock isn't the solid buy   it was. Indeed, even Buffett seems to be rethinking how   attractive Apple stock is after its sharp increase recently.""I want to emphasize, we have not bought at this price. I   mean, we quit buying when the earnings came out,"" Buffett said in   a recent interview with CNBC. Importantly, Buffett was also   careful to emphasize that Berkshire is ""certainly not selling   either.""Putting Apple stock's soaring valuation into perspective, the   rising stock price has pushed its price-to-earnings ratio from   about 11 one year ago to nearly 17 today.AAPL P/E Ratio (TTM)data byYCharts.However, Apple's pricier valuation today shouldn't lead   investors to immediately conclude the stock is no longer a buy.   Apple stock still trades much more conservatively than many other   companies. For instance, the average P/E ratio for stocks in theS&P 500is 26. Combining Apple's conservative valuation with the   company's recent growth, the stock is still a good long-term bet   -- even at $139.

Spotify Growth Surges Despite Apple, Inc.'s Revamped Apple Music;3/6/2017;"Apple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) launch of its Spotify-like streaming music   service in 2015 was an important move for the tech giant. Not   only did it bolster Apple's services business with a new   subscription offering, but it strengthened the overall integrated   ecosystem of Apple-branded hardware, software, and services that   help customers stay locked into Apple's products.But is Apple's music service failing to live up to its   potential? Spotify's rapid growth since Apple Music's launch   suggests Apple's new music service may not be resonating with   customers the way investors hoped it would.Image source: Spotify.makeArticleAd();Spotify vs. Apple Music: By the numbersApple Music recently made headlines when Apple Internet   Software and Products Vice President Eddy Cue toldBillboardthat the music service had surpassed 20 million subscribers. Cue   also took the opportunity to give the world a glimpse of Apple's   ambition with the service, noting that the company went from zero   subscribers in June 2015 to 20 million in December 2016. ""[O]f   course we want more and we want it to go faster -- we're hungry!""   Cue toldBillboard.But despite Apple Music hitting the 20-million subscriber   milestone, Spotify's March 2 announcement that it just hit 50   million subscribers shows how its service is growing   significantly faster than Apple Music recently. Spotify's   reported 50 million paid subscribers is up from 40 million in the   middle of September. This represents a growth rate of about 1.8   million paid users a month. Apple's most recent milestone of 20   million was up about 3 million users in three months compared to   its last update on its paid users for Apple Music, representing a   growth rate of about 1 million per month.Maybe Spotify is a bit hungrier than Apple?There's no excuse for Apple Music's underperformanceAhead of Apple Music's launch, everything lined up for the   music service to quickly grow to rival Spotify, or at least to   hit a point where it can sustain Spotify's growth rates. After   all, Apple was already a music juggernaut with its iTunes. With   Apple reporting in 2014 it had 800 million credit card numbers   linked to iTunes, the service easily has over a billion credit   cards on file in 2017. Adding to the growing list of reasons for   Apple Music to be a smashing hit, Apple even redesigned Apple   Music ""from the ground up"" this summer in an effort to accelerate   demand for the service. Apple Music should have easily built on   this strong foundation and catapulted the new music service to a   level that threatened Spotify's dominance.Apple Music. Image source: Apple.What's even more concerning is that Spotify's meteoric growth   only highlights how unfortunate it is that Apple hasn't built a   streaming music service compelling enough to keep up with   Spotify's stronger ability to attract new customers. Growing from   30 million paid subscribers last March to 40 million about three   months ago to about 50 million now, Spotify is putting the   spotlight on the strength of the streaming music market.On the other hand, with Spotify's growth continuing to outpace   Apple Music's, this new milestone for Spotify could potentially   serve as a wake-up call for Apple management to begin investing   more aggressively in its streaming music offering. And given   Apple's $50 billion-plus in annual free cash flow, its resources   to invest in its music service are virtually unlimited compared   to Spotify's business model, which has yet to achieve   profitability.But given Spotify's ability to outperform Apple Music so far,   Apple investors shouldn't count on Apple Music catching up to   Spotify.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock       tip, it can pay to listen.

Why Intel Corporation Is Unlikely to Lose the Apple Inc. Mac Anytime Soon;3/6/2017;"Rumors are swirling that microprocessor giantIntel(NASDAQ: INTC) may be on the verge of losing its spot as the   supplier of the processors that powerApple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) iMac desktop and MacBook notebook products.Hypotheses range from Apple's designing its own chip for the   Mac to speculation that Apple will use chips from alternative   processor vendors. However, I believe that based on Intel's   recent commentary at its Feb. 9 investor day, it is unlikely that   the company is going to lose these orders.Image source: Apple.makeArticleAd();Intel's CCG financial guidanceIf Intel were to lose some -- or all -- of the Mac processor   orders, this would manifest as a reduction in the company's   Client Computing Group (CCG) revenue and operating profits. If we   estimate that Apple pays an average of $200 for Intel processors   and related components, then that's $4 billion in revenue that   could potentially be at risk.Put another way, if that $4 billion were to disappear (or drop   significantly), then Intel could potentially see more than 10% of   its CCG revenue vanish. That wouldn't be the end of the world,   but it's the sort of thing that would sting.At its investor day, Intel said that it expects its revenue in   CCG to decline at a ""low-single-digits"" pace -- or an average of   1%-3% annually over the next three years. If we compound the low   and high ends of that range, Intel is planning for between a 3%   and a 9% decline in CCG revenue from 2016 levels by the end of   2019.Here's a translation to hard dollar figures: Intel is planning   for CCG revenue to drop by a total of between $1 billion and $3   billion in that three-year period -- $2 billion at the   midpoint.At the same time, CEO Brian Krzanich said in his investor   meeting presentation that he expects the PC processor total   addressable market to be worth around $30 billion in 2021 -- $2   billion down from where the company pegged the total addressable   market in 2016.Putting the numbers togetherIf Intel expects the PC processor total addressable market to   drop by around $2 billion by 2021 and is planning for   ""low-single-digit"" declines in CCG through 2019 (a $2 billion   decline at the midpoint), then it doesn't look to me like the   company is guiding for significant personal-computer processor   revenue share loss.Now, it's worth noting that forecasts this long out aren't   going to be perfect, but Intel likely has visibility into the   personal-computer design win pipelines at its various customers,   including Apple. If Apple were preparing to shift away from Intel   processors for Macs released over the next couple of years, then   Intel would likely be aware of that imminent shift and should   have included that expectation in its multi-year forecast.Based on this analysis, I don't think Intel investors ought to   worry too much about Apple's switching away from Intel processors   anytime soon in its MacBook or iMac products.Over the long term, however, anything is possible, so Intel   will have to make sure that it has an increasingly compelling   product pipeline to keep Apple interested.10 stocks we like better than IntelWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better     buys.Click hereto learn about these picks!*Stock Advisor returns as of February 6, 2017This podcast was recorded on March 2, 2017.Sean O'Reilly:Welcome toIndustry Focus, the podcast that dives into a different sector of the stock   market every day. Today is Thursday, March 2, 2017, so   we're talking about energy, materials, and   industrials. I am your host, Sean O'Reilly, and joining   me today via phone is Motley Fool senior auto   specialist, Mr. John Rosevear. Good morning, John!John Rosevear:Good morning, Sean! How are you, today?O'Reilly:Extremely well. It's good to hear your voice. It's been   awhile, a month or two, since we last had a podcast, and I   missed you, buddy.Rosevear:Yeah, it's been a few weeks.O'Reilly:I had to get you in here to answer an all-important question.Rosevear:What's the question?O'Reilly:You're the only guy I know who can answer this for   me. I hate driving, I live in D.C., it's very tiring, I   want to know when I'm going to get my self-driving car.Rosevear:Well, it depends on what you mean by get, and   really depends on what you mean by   self-driving, [laughs] unfortunately.O'Reilly:I'm not touching the wheel in my driveway.Rosevear:Let's back up and define some terms here. This system of   classification for things that assist drivers has become   pretty universal. It was developed by the Society of Automotive   Engineers in the U.S. The U.S. government has adopted   it, other governments have adopted it, it's the way all   automakers talk now. They categorize it in six levels that   are helpfully numbered from zero to five. A level zero system,   there's no automation, the driver does everything. This might   even include warning systems like lane departure warning. But,   the driver actually has to do everything. Level one is when   you get some basic level of driver   assistance, assistance that parallel parks for   you, that kind of stuff. That's a level one system.O'Reilly:Does that include anti-lock brakes? I'm surprised   that's on here.Rosevear:That's...O'Reilly:Eye of the beholder?Rosevear:The driver is still executing that. They count that as an   intervention system. It's when the car decides to break for you   that it starts to become assisted. These emergency   stopping systems that they have now where the radar is on   the front of the car, the levels one through five require some   level of sensing what's going on around a car. So, yeah, these   parallel park systems where the car spins the wheel for you and   backs into the spot, that kind of thing, that's a level one.   Level two is where it starts to get interesting. This is the   system where you're on the highway and the traffic jam assist   systems, maybe the earliest versions of Tesla's   autopilot, where you can kind of take your hand off the   wheel under certain circumstances, and the car will maintain and   adjust its speed relative to the cars around to you, and it   will keep itself in its lane. It's doing a little   steering and a little accelerating and decelerating on its   own. But there still has to be a human driver, the human   driver has to be ready to grab the wheel. In fact, a lot of   these systems require you to actually touch the wheel every   minute or two, or something like that. Level three is   when it kind of gets into self driving. This is a system that can   drive under certain conditions, we might say highway   driving, this is where Tesla's autopilot is starting to go,   this is where some of the systems,GM's(NYSE: GM) Super Cruise that will come out on Cadillac   soon, this is where it ends up, level three.O'Reilly:Super Cruise? [laughs]Rosevear:That's what they call it. That's what they've been   calling it for a few years, I'm not completely sure   that's what they're going to call it when it comes to   market. Anyway, the gist here is, it's self-driving until   suddenly it isn't, the driver has to be ready to grab the   wheel. That makes it a little tricky. We'll talk about that   in a minute.O'Reilly:The Motley Fool's Dan Sparks did that article about a year   ago, he lives out in Colorado and he has a Tesla, how   far did he get, 90 miles? I can't remember, but, I   don't think he touched the wheel on the freeway with that   thing.Rosevear:Tesla's official instructions with the original system where   you're supposed to touch the wheel regularly, they considered it   an advanced level two system. I think now they're into level   three territory. The border here is a little bit fuzzy. The   border to level four is not fuzzy. Level four is, the car is   driving itself, period. It does not need you, but it's   limited. Usually what it means is it's limited to an area   that's been mapped, we say it's been geofenced.   These systems tend to depend on very highly detailed 3D   maps that show stuff that normal maps don't show,   like exactly where the curb is within a couple inches and so   forth, so the car can navigate precisely, especially on   a city street. So, it's full self-driving, you don't ever   have to touch a steering wheel, but it only works where the   car has a map. Level five -- and we'll get back to this in a   minute -- is the full-blown thing. It'll drive itself   wherever you want under any conditions. If it's   snowing, it'll go up a mountain, whatever,   anything.So, what we're talking about in the near future is level   four, a car that will self-drive itself. This is coming soon. But   it's limited by its maps. The idea is, gradually the maps   will expand over time and you'll be able to drive --O'Reilly:Are there cities that are being mapped right now? I'm   actually surprised to hear this.Rosevear:Yeah, Pittsburgh is being mapped. This is where Uber is   doing their testing, a lot of it. This is actually where   Ford's new company they created as a start-up with a veteran of   Uber and a veteran of Google's self-driving car project running   it. This is basically Ford's software team for self-driving,   and they're in Pittsburgh. There's been a lot of mapping   done, interestingly, in Pittsburgh, because the   artificial intelligence lab at Carnegie Mellon is the   source of a lot of the research that went into this, so, a   lot of the people are there. There's some mapping going on   in San Francisco. I know GM's   cruise automation subsidiary is doing testing of level   four assistance in San Francisco, so they have mapping going   on. Then, there are companies mapping all over the place. Tesla,   I think, is automating some of this mapping with the sensors   on their existing cars. A company calledMobileye(NYSE: MBLY)  is going to start doing mapping with   sensors on their customers' cars, these are sensors for level two   systems but they can help do the mapping for level four. This is   going to start very soon, probably next year for Mobileye. There   are private companies trying to do this, too, hoping to   be able to sell the maps to the automakers or whoever. And, of   course, the big wild card in this is, of course, Waymo. Google's   been mapping for years and years. [laughs]O'Reilly:You've seen the cars? They look ridiculous, they have the   pole and they have the ball of cameras on the top, and they just   drive around all these cities. That's how I can see what   my dentist's office looks like from across the street.   They're mapping cities with that, too?Rosevear:Yeah. I think everybody is. And it's not just mapping for   Google Maps, it's mapping at a much more fine level of   detail, where is the curb, where is the speed bump, and so   forth, so the car knows what to expect as it's driving. The   idea is, a map is a fallback from its sensors. If it's dark   out, if it's foggy, if the lighter system is   being buggy for whatever reason, you can kind of fall   back on the maps. Because these are safety systems, there   has to be redundancy built in. That's the thinking.O'Reilly:So, when is this stuff coming out?Rosevear:Good question. Tesla constantly does these upgrades, and   they'll break into level four at some point. If I had to   guess, I'd say 2019. But I don't know for sure. They may not   even know absolutely for sure when they'll be ready to ship   it. There's also an interesting question there that with their   owners of their current models, they've been shipping stuff that   maybe has some bugs still in it for the owners to bang on.   And because Tesla owners tend to be early adopter types,   they're mostly cool with that. As Tesla moves into the mass   market with its upcoming Model 3, something else we've   talked about, I don't know if they're going to tighten it up   a little bit. They might. We'll see. But that might push   that data off. But, anyway, this partnership of giant   auto supplierDelphi, Mobileye, which is a machine vision specialist that   has done a lot of work around--O'Reilly:And but they are publicly traded, right? For our   listeners.Rosevear:They are. The ticker there is MBLY. Look them up, because if   you want a pure-play on self-driving, that's as close as it   gets. The third company in this isIntel, which is designing the processors. They're working   together on a level four system. We've talked about this   before. They will have this available to any automaker who wants   it by the end of 2019, they say. Now, the cars are going to   ship in 2019. These things are incorporated as the cars are   developed. So, probably late 2020, early 2021, people   will be shipping cars with this system in, but those cars   may not go to retail. [laughs]O'Reilly:What?! Will they hang out and not do anything? [laughs]Rosevear:Here's what, for instance, Ford is saying. Ford says,   ""We're going to mass produce a level four vehicle   starting in 2021."" Great. Then, they say, ""Yeah, but we're not   going to sell it at retail. This is going to be for car sharing   use in cities and ride hailing services, Lyft and Uber and so   on."" It's because of the maps. They only want to sell it   where they have the maps. CEO Mark Fields at Ford has said,   ""We're not even going to give it a steering wheel in this,""   so obviously it has to have the maps. Again, as the maps   expand, there'll be more. Ford is saying right now that they   think they'll have level four functionality in their retail   vehicles 2025-ish. But they always say that, Bill   Ford, executive chairman of Ford, always says, ""We throw out   these dates, but it's always earlier than I expect."" So,   we'll see. Right now they're saying 2025. So, yeah, he says,   ""This stuff moves much faster than we expect."" There's also   some other stuff going on. The thing to emphasize here, I   should back up a little bit, not all the automakers, not all the   tech companies talk about what they're doing. There will be   surprises here. This is just, what has been announced, what we   have seen, what we generally know is coming.O'Reilly:Yeah, once you go public with something you get held to   it in some capacity, and nobody wants to get egg on their   face.Rosevear:Right. And GM originally said they'd launch Super Cruise in   2016 --O'Reilly:They need to get a different name for   that. [laughs]Rosevear:Yeah, OK. They're a level three system. They came out a while   back and said, ""Wait a minute, we're not happy with it,   we're going to do more work and make it more advanced.   We're not going to set a firm date, but we think late   2017-18, probably around there."" But again, they are   not holding themselves to a firm date on that. In fact,   they're not holding themselves to a firm date on a lot of   this stuff. Mary Barra's thing is, ""We'll ship it when it's   ready."" But what we do know is that GM is planning to   actually start building a whole lot of level four vehicles,   reportedly in the thousands. These will be the electric Chevy   Volts. They will be fitted with prototype level   four systems, and they will go into this massive test   with Lyft in several different cities. So, when will   you get your level four car?O'Reilly:Which is why they invest in Lyft.Rosevear:Right. They own 9% of Lyft, it's something like that.   It's a major investment, certainly, for GM. But, when   do you get yourself a driving car? If you're in D.C., you   might get one in several months from now or a year from now, when   you summon Lyft with your smartphone and a Chevy Volt comes. Uber   is already doing this on a tiny scale in Pittsburgh. They   have 8 or 12 cars or something that are prototype   self-driving vehicles in their fleet. With these   things, there are two engineers on board. One is ready to   grab the wheel and the other one is taking notes on   everything that's happening with the system. And it may be   the same deal with these GM Lyft self-driving vehicles. So   it might not seem all that exciting because there's somebody   in the front seat, but the car is driving itself, is the   idea. This is a way to rack up a whole lot of test miles   quickly, if you have a whole bunch of these things out   there, you know?O'Reilly:Yeah. I can't wait to see all these Lyft driverless   cars handle all the roundabouts in D.C., that'll be a   treat.Rosevear:Yeah, they'll teach them. We call them rotaries up here in   New England, we have lots of them too. It'll be   interesting to see how they handle Boston, which is colonial   era streets in some areas of town. [laughs]O'Reilly:Yeah, they're made for horses, not driverless cars.Rosevear:Yeah. Well, they were made to walk in, or cow   paths, definitely not driverless cars. But, there's other   stuff in here, too. The wild card is Waymo, which is the   Alphabet subsidiary that used to be the Google Self-Driving   Car Project and has now been set up as a company to go into   business and commercialize this in some way. Who will   partner with them? They had this little deal with Fiat   Chrysler where Chrysler built them some Chrysler   Pacifica minivans as test vehicles that took on their   latest prototype system. They've been talking toHonda, reportedly. But of course, there's a certain view in the auto   industry that a deal with Waymo is a deal with the   devil because Google will want all the data. And then you're   an Android phone maker, and Google's making all the   money. That is a great fear. I think every auto CEO in the world   is mindful of the example of the phone   industry. [laughs] They don't want to give up the   data. I think that is actually a lot of the selling   proposition of the Delphi-Mobileye system, this is a system   developed within the established auto industry supplier   structure. We'll share the maps among our fellow automakers   and so forth, but we're not selling the data to   Google. [laughs]O'Reilly:What do you think has been going on there? Correct me if I'm   wrong, but Google has those tiny little white go-kart   looking driverless cars for years. The laymen, we haven't   gotten a hint of them trying to make a buck off of them   at all. It's weird.Rosevear:They hired, a while back, and executive named John Krafcik.   He had been the president ofTrueCar, and before that, he had been in the business for years. He   was with several automakers, in management   capacities, executive capacities. He's a guy who knows the   business, a good guy, smart guy. His job is to lead Waymo and   find a way to bring this stuff to market somehow. He's been out   there talking to automakers. He actually did a really big   presentation at the North American International Auto Show   in Detroit in January -- I was going to say last month,   but it's March now. He was talking about where their system   is and so forth. They have a solid prototype level four   system. I think he was there, in part, fishing for   automakers who might want to have conversation. It's   possible those conversations have happened and nobody   is talking about them. The ones that have made it into the   media are Honda and, of course, Fiat Chrysler, which is   a much more overt thing, because the latest test vehicles   are all Chryslers.O'Reilly:We don't have this as a note, so feel free to tell me   you don't know a ton about this, but I'm sure all of our   listeners are on the tip of their tongues with this, they   want to hear, what is Apple up to? They have that big   plan, and I've got a push notification fromThe Wall Street Journala year ago that Apple was going to build a car within   the decade, blah blah, then they pulled back on it, they're doing   testing again. What is Tim Cook scheming right now?Rosevear:Good question. Yeah, I remember when thatWall Street Journalthing came out.O'Reilly:You got the notification too, I'm sure.Rosevear:I did, and I actually poked a few sources and ended up   writing a big piece for The Motley Fool first thing on   Saturday morning after that broke, sort of, what does this   mean, can they actually do it, that kind of thing. And the   answer was, Apple has so much money that, of course, they   could start a car company, the question is, do they want   to?O'Reilly:Yeah, I remember you talking about that.Rosevear:Right. They can throw money at it. The full boat, it's about $10   billion to get to where Tesla is where they have a factory   and they're banging out cars and it's really high level of   quality and so forth. Full boat. That's Tim Cook's lunch   money these days. [laughs] Their cash load is   unbelievable. They can do anything. The question is, would   they want to? The margins in the car business, by   Apple's standards, are pretty lousy. A luxury car   business might make an operating margin of 10-12%. If   you're Porsche, you might make 16%. That's kind of the upper   limit.O'Reilly:So, is it possible that Google and Apple wind   up dropping the brains in these cars and calling it a day?   Google already, they must have tons of data on these cars   operating.Rosevear:Google has made it clear, John Krafcik came out and said,   ""We're not building cars, we're not going to build a   car factory, we are not building cars. We're looking for   partnerships, we are not building cars."" Apple hasn't said   anything, of course. Officially, this program doesn't even exist.   But the word was, a lot of the people who might have been on   the actual build-a-car side of the business have been let go.   People working on electric self-driving cars are in very hot   demand these days. So, none of these people are wanting for   employment. But it was thought that a lot of those folks   were let go, and they really ratcheted down the ambitions of   the program. They may be aiming to do something where they come   out, like Waymo, and offer a system that Apple-izes a self   driving car built by somebody else. It's possible that they   will find an automaker to partner with, and maybe offer that as a   deluxe ride hailing option. My thought when they were   originally talking about this was that they were going to build   the deluxe Apple version of robot Uber, where it's a little   bit more money but it's a nicer car, and it recognizes all   your Apple devices and it's this seamless experience, it sees   your iPhone and it automatically sets your seat and   your climate and your music and everything else and all this   stuff, it takes exactly where you want to go, and it's   just a subscription model, $500 a month for the Apple Car   service. That's where I thought they were going to go.   Others disagreed. Some of my fellow Fools who are also very close   watchers of this kind of technology and particularly   close watchers of Apple thought they might actually build a car   for retail Tesla-style.O'Reilly:Cool. We're about out of time, John. I want to give you   the last word. When am I magically going to get   my driverless car in my driveway?Rosevear:If you want a Tesla, you might get it by the end of the   decade. If you want a car from one of the bigger automakers,   it's probably a few years beyond that. Somebody may surprise   us and have a level four car out by 2020 or 2021 that has a   fairly big map. But I'm thinking it might be over the next   couple years after that that these start to be available for   retail. I suspect the first ones that come out, it will be an   expensive option on a luxury car.O'Reilly:Awesome. John, I cannot thank you enough, once again,   for your time.Rosevear:It's always a pleasure.O'Reilly:I have to imagine that as this continues to ramp   up, this will not be our last show about this topic.Rosevear:Oh, heavens no. We'll be talking about this for several   years to come. It's a big deal.O'Reilly:Awesome. Well, have a good day, John! Thank you,   again!Rosevear:All right. Take care, Sean!O'Reilly:Bye.

Should Qualcomm Inc. Worry About Xiaomi's New Chips?;3/6/2017;"Mobile chipmakerQualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM) and Chinese smartphone giantXiaomiare often considered close partners. Qualcomm became one of   Xiaomi's earliest investors in 2011, and all of Xiaomi's flagship   devices use Qualcomm chips. When regulatory troubles in China   forced Qualcomm to renegotiate its licensing terms with OEMs,   Xiaomi was one of the first companies tosign a new dealwith the chipmaker.However, that alliance gradually weakened. Xiaomi eventually   started using moreMediaTek(NASDAQOTH: MDTKF) chips in its cheaper devices, and    ongoing rumors indicated that the company was developing   first-party chips. Those rumors were finally confirmed in late   February, when Xiaomi unveiled the Surge S1 chip for its new   mid-range Mi 5c smartphone.Xiaomi's Mi5c. Image source: Xiaomi.makeArticleAd();The Surge S1 is a 28nm chip with eight cores, four of which   run at 2.2GHz with another four running at 1.4GHz. Its Mali T-860   MP4 GPU is capable of playing 4K videos. Those specs make it   slightly more  powerful than Qualcomm's Snapdragon 625, a   popular octa-core processor which powers mid-range devices like   the international variant of Xiaomi's Mi Note 4. The S1 was   produced by Xiaomi's subsidiary Pinecone Electronics via a   partnership with Chinese chipmakerLeadcore.Why Xiaomi needed to make its own chipsBack in 2014, Xiaomi became the biggest smartphone maker in   China. But by the end of 2016, it had dropped to fifth place   afterOppo,Huawei,Vivo, andApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) , in that order. That decline was caused by   competitors flooding the market with comparably priced phones, a   shift in consumer tastes toward pricier devices, and an overall   slowdown across the Chinese smartphone market.Last November, Xiaomi admitted that its  core phone   business wasn't profitable. In January, it stopped disclosing   annual shipment  figures and abruptly announced that it   would skip this year's Mobile World Congress. Those moves all   indicated that the company was struggling to stay afloat in the   crowded Chinese market.However, Xiaomi also noticed that it could follow Apple,   Huawei, andSamsung's(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) lead and develop first-party ARM chips.   Producing first-party chips is a pricey investment, but it's a   smart long-term play because it reduces Xiaomi's dependence on   chipmakers like Qualcomm, cuts production costs, tightens up the   supply chain, and gives it full control over the hardware and the   software -- which could better optimize its devices for Xiaomi's   MIUI custom Android OS.Xiaomi's Mi Air Purifier. Image source: Xiaomi.In addition to lowering costs and boosting performance, IDC   analyst Bryan Ma also noted that Xiaomi's first-party chips could   work better with its smart home ecosystem, which already includes   air purifiers, bathroom scales, lights, and even rice cookers.   Xiaomi could also use its first-party chips to bypass a ban on   MediaTek chips in India, which occurred due to a patent dispute   withEricsson.What this means for QualcommXiaomi's introduction of first-party chips isn't good news for   Qualcomm, but there's no indication that Xiaomi will stop using   Qualcomm chips altogether. The Mi 5c merely represents the budget   device of its flagship Mi 5 family -- which includes the original   Mi 5, the Mi 5S, and the Mi 5S Plus. All three of the other Mi 5   devices use Qualcomm chips.Therefore, the Surge S1 could actually hurt MediaTek -- which   supplies Xiaomi with chips for variants of its low and mid-range   devices -- instead of Qualcomm. If the Surge S1 becomes Xiaomi's   official mid-range chipset, it could stop using MediaTek chips as   Qualcomm chips remain in high-end devices.Qualcomm's Snapdragon could lose its spot in mid-range devices   like the Mi Note 4, but the overall impact on its chipmaking   business might be minimal. Xiaomi's global market share is   already likely below 5%, based on IDC estimates, and could   continue fading as Oppo, Huawei, and Vivo launch new devices.   SincesomeOppo, Huawei, and Vivo devices use Qualcomm chips, higher sales   at those leading brands could easily offset any design losses at   Xiaomi.So should Qualcomm investors be worried?If Xiaomi had revealed the Surge S1 back in 2014, then swapped   out all Qualcomm chips with its own silicon, I think investors   would have been worried. But Xiaomi is merely aiming its new   chips at the mid-range market today, and any losses from Xiaomi   could probably be offset by higher sales of other rival Android   devices.Therefore, investors shouldn't consider Xiaomi's announcement   to be a major blow to Qualcomm on its own. Nonetheless, the   overall trend is worrisome, because it indicates that Qualcomm's   chipmaking business -- which posted flat year-over-year sales   growth last quarter -- will likely continue ceding market share   to first-party ARM chips for the foreseeable future.10 stocks we like better than QualcommWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Should I Buy BlackBerry Ltd (BBRY)? 3 Pros, 3 Cons;3/6/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe collapse ofBlackBerry Ltd(NASDAQ:BBRY) has been stunning. But in the tech world, such things do happen with regularity.makeArticleAd();Source:WEi WEi via FlickrYet BBRY stock is still far from dead. Hey, if anything, it's amazing that the company has been able to recover from having to deal with the onslaught of mega operators likeApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) andSamsung(OTCMKTS:SSNLF). Let's face it, evenMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) couldn't put up successful fight. This was certainly a major reason why CEO Steve Ballmer stepped aside.But survival is not enough, of course. So it should be no surprise that - for the past five years - BBRY stock is off about 50%.OK then, what about the future? Might there be a turnaround? Well, right now, it may seem kind of tough to imagine. But then again, this was the sentiment for say,Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMD), a year ago, right?Definitely.7 Telecom Stocks That Are High-Yield Money TrapsSo to gauge the potential opportunity of BlackBerry stock, let's take a look at three pros and cons:3 Pros On BBRY StockLeadership: The CEO of BBRY, John Chen, is a proven veteran in the tech industry. Back in 1997, he took the helm ofSybase, which was struggling againstOracle Corporation(NYSE:ORCL). But he restructured the operations and redirected the company towards enterprise mobility and commerce. He would ultimately sell Sybase toSAP SE (ADR)(NYSE:SAP) for a hefty $5.8 billion.Yet Chen also has strongtechnical chops. Consider that he has a master's in electrical engineering from California Institute of Technology. He also got his first job as an engineer withBurroughsin 1979.Reinvention: Transitioning a company from hardware to software is no easy feat. But Chen has definitely made lots of progress with this strategy. In the latest quarter, the revenues from Software & Services came to roughly55% of the total. Oh, and about 80% was recurring. In all, there were over 3,000 enterprise customer orders in the quarter.For Chen, he has made some savvy acquisitions, such as forEncription,Good TechnologyandAtHoc. And another important part of the strategy has been to outsource phone development. This has meant fewer distractions as well as the opportunity to pick-up high-margin licensing revenues.Something else: Chen has done a good job in leveraging some of the long-time core technology assets. An example of this is BlackBerry Secure, which is a full-blown suite of mobile enterprise apps.Long-Term Opportunities: BBRY is trying to position itself to get a share of the embedded technology market, which is seeing tremendous growth from the auto sector. Note that the company has BlackBerry QNX, which is a software development platform that provides top-notch security features and has been awarded the ISO 26262 ASIL D certification for cars. The system is optimized to support leading vendors likeNvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA),Intel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) and AMD.As a testament to the advantages of QNX, BBRY recently signed an agreement withFord Motor Company(NYSE:F) to cover more car models.3 Cons On BBRY StockBrand Issues: Back in 2007, BBRY was the global leader in the fast-growing smartphone market. But the iPhone would quickly end this dominance. What's more, BBRY made plenty of blunders, such as in terms of awful launches.The result is that the BlackBerry brand is fairly tarnished. Granted, this many not seem to matter as much since the company has moved away from the consumer market. However, the brand could still be a problem with business customers as well. Why use technology from a company that seems to have a dicey future?Competition: It's intense. When it comes to the security market, there are many players that have great offerings likeFortinet Inc(NASDAQ:FTNT),Palo Alto Networks Inc(NYSE:PANW) andCheck Point Software Technologies Ltd.(NASDAQ:CHKP).But of course, the market for enterprise mobility solutions also has many tough operators. Just some includeVMware, Inc.(NYSE:VMW), MSFT,International Business Machines Corp.(NYSE:IBM) and SAP.And finally, BBRY's offerings in the messaging category also must fight against stiff competition, such as withFacebook Inc's(NASDAQ:FB) WhatsApp, MSFT's Skype, AAPL's iMessage and even Snap Inc's(NYSE:SNAP) Snapchat.M&A: For the most part, BBRY seems to be good buyout bait. The company's cost structure has been streamlined, there are strong technology assets and a large customer base.Yet According toInvestorPlace.com's Richard Saintvilus: ""It has become clear that Chen - who was brought in to build BlackBerry into an M&A target - has taken this company as far as he can take it. Despite all of the boasting the company has done about its superior security capabilities, BBRY stock has had no M&A suitors, suggesting companies likeCisco Systems, Inc.(NASDAQ:CSCO), Oracle Corporation and other enterprise-focused companies with which BlackBerry has often been linked, don't care.""Bottom Line On BBRY StockAgain, Chen has done a great job. Let's face it, BBRY was a complete mess when he came on board in late 2013.Use Micron Technology, Inc. (MU) Stock to Unlock Free ProfitsHe wasted little time with cost cutting and outsourcing of the phone business. More importantly, he has invested in areas like security, embedded systems and even the Internet of Things (IoT).However, despite all this, the fact remains that progress has been grudging. If anything, it will probably still take some time - say a year or so - for the changes to have a real impact. In other words, for those looking at BBRY stock, it's probably best not to rush to buy it right now.Tom Taulli runs the InvestorPlace blogIPO Playbookand is the author of various books, includingTaxes 2017: Saving A Bundle.Follow him on Twitter at@ttaulli.

6 Things You Didn't Know About Fitbit Inc.;3/6/2017;"The meteoric rise and epic fall of fitness tracker makerFitbit(NYSE: FIT)  occurred in less than two years. Fitbit went   public in June 2015 at $20 per share, surged to nearly $50 the   following month, then plummeted to about $6 today.Investors might recall thebullet pointsin that story: demand initially surged as the public embraced   fitness tracking devices and apps, but the market was quickly   saturated with cheaper devices that crushed Fitbit's top and   bottom line growth. However, investors might not know these six   lesser-known facts about the company.Fitbit's Charge 2. Image source: Fitbit.makeArticleAd();1. The founders were inspired by the Nintendo     WiiFitbit CEO James Park and  CTO Eric Friedman co-founded   Fitbit in 2007, after noticing howNintendo's(NASDAQOTH: NTDOY) Wii combined motion sensors with software to   gamify personal fitness.Park, who felt out of shape at the time, wanted to create a   fitness-tracking device priced between basic $25 pedometers and   pricier sports watches. The idea initially secured $400,000 in   funding from the founders' family and friends, and raised tens of   millions more via official funding rounds, but the company almost   failedseven timesbefore it filed for an IPO in 2015.2. Park and Friedman sold their previous start-up to     CNETAfter dropping out of Harvard, Park worked atMorgan Stanleyfor a year. He subsequently co-founded software firm Epesi   Technologies, where Friedman served as the founding engineer.   Park and Friedman subsequently co-founded Windup Labs, a digital   photo sharing service which they sold to CNET in 2005.3. It recently stopped suing JawboneFitbit's first serious competitor emerged in 2011, whenJawbonelaunched its UP activity tracker. In 2015, Jawbone sued Fitbit   for  allegedly infringing its patents and stealing trade   secrets by hiring its employees.The legal clashes resulted in several patents being   invalidated, then revalidated, and Fitbit gradually gained the   upper hand against Jawbone. But last December, Fitbit abruptly   dropped a key ITC lawsuit against Jawbone, claiming that a   victory would be worthless because Jawbone was teetering on the   brink of bankruptcy.4. Why Applereallybooted it from its storesAs competition from Jawbone faded, a bigger threat emerged   whenApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) introduced the Apple Watch in late 2014. Shortly   after the announcement, Apple stopped selling Fitbit devices at    its brick-and-mortar and online stores.Image source: Apple.Many consumers probably think that Apple did that to reduce   direct competition for the Apple Watch, but that was only partly   true. The main reason was actually Fitbit's refusal to sync its   devices to Apple's HealthKit platform, which pulls data from   multiple devices and apps to a unified dashboard -- similar to   Google Fit. Fitbit wanted to grow its own digital ecosystem   without Apple pulling away its users, but the decision greatly   reduced its exposure to Apple's customers.5. Doctors have questioned the accuracy of its     devicesA major criticism which has plagued Fitbit since its earliest   days is that it isn't a certified medical device. In late 2015,   oncologist Dr. Andrew Trister, who  works at Sage   Bionetworks, noted that many patients brought Excel spreadsheets   full of fitness tracker data, but that he and other doctors had   ""no idea"" what to do with the information since they weren't   collected from certified medical devices.In a Jan. 2016 article at  iMedicalApps, Dr. Satish Misra   -- a Cardiology Fellow at Johns Hopkins -- stated that he   couldn't ""help but wonder about risks when recommending specific,   unvalidated devices"" (like Fitbit trackers), and that it ""would   be prudent to stick to validated devices that at least have solid   evidence behind them.""These arguments cast serious doubts on the growth of Fitbit's   corporate wellness programs, but Fitbit's recent partnership with   medical device giantMedtronicto monitor diabetic patients couldboost its credibilityamong medical professionals.6. It will likely buy up more wearable techAs Fitbit runs out of room to grow, it's looking toward   inorganic growth to boost its top line growth again. Over the   past year, it acquired mobile payments companyCoin, the assets of  smartwatch makerPebble, and high-end smartwatch makerVector.Vector's Luna and Meridian smartwatches. Image source:     Vector.These moves all indicate that Fitbit wants to diversify its   portfolio and create more technically advanced smartwatches.   However, doing so could send it on a collision course with Apple   and Android Wear device makers in the high-end market -- which   are all battling it out to dominate a relatively small niche   market. It could also ""diworsify"" Fitbit's core business and   cause its margins to contract -- which could be devastating to   its long-term growth.10 stocks we like better than FitbitWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Interesting December Stock Options for AAPL;3/6/2017;"Consistently, one of the more popular stocks people enter into theirstock options watchlistat Stock Options Channel is Apple Inc (Symbol: AAPL). So this week we highlight one interesting put contract, and one interesting call contract, from the December expiration for AAPL. The put contract our YieldBoost algorithm identified as particularly interesting, is at the $115 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $3.05. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 2.6% return against the $115 commitment, or a 3.4% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this theYieldBoost).Selling a put does not give an investor access to AAPL's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. So unless Apple Inc sees its shares fall 17.1% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $111.95 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $3.05 from $115), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 3.4% annualized rate of return.makeArticleAd();Interestingly, that annualized 3.4% figure actually exceeds the 1.6% annualized dividend paid by Apple Inc by 1.8%, based on the current share price of $138.73. And yet, if an investor was to buy the stock at the going market price in order to collect the dividend, there is greater downside because the stock would have to fall 17.11% to reach the $115 strike price.Always important when discussing dividends is the fact that, in general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of Apple Inc, looking at the dividend history chart for AAPL below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 1.6% annualized dividend yield.Turning to the other side of the option chain, we highlight one call contract of particular interest for the December expiration, for shareholders of Apple Inc (Symbol: AAPL) looking to boost their income beyond the stock's 1.6% annualized dividend yield. Selling the covered call at the $160 strike and collecting the premium based on the $3.40 bid, annualizes to an additional 3.1% rate of return against the current stock price (this is what we at Stock Options Channel refer to as theYieldBoost), for a total of 4.8% annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away. Any upside above $160 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away, but AAPL shares would have to advance 15.3% from current levels for that to happen, meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called, the shareholder has earned a 17.8% return from this trading level, in addition to any dividends collected before the stock was called.The chart below shows the trailing twelve month trading history for Apple Inc, highlighting in green where the $115 strike is located relative to that history, and highlighting the $160 strike in red:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the December put or call options highlighted in this article deliver a rate of return that represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Apple Inc (considering the last 251 trading dayAAPL historical stock pricesusing closing values, as well as today's price of $138.73) to be 20%.Top YieldBoost AAPL Calls »"

This 5-Stock Portfolio Crushes the S&P 500;3/6/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMost investorsstilldon't understand dividend stocks.makeArticleAd();Why?Because they spendwaytoo much time obsessing over one figure - the dividend yield - and ignore stocks with payouts below some arbitrary number, say 2%, which is about what theSPDR S&P 500 ETF(SPY) pays.ConsiderVisa Inc(V),a stock that getszerolove from the dividend crowd, no thanks to its 0.69% trailing-twelve-month yield, which has gone nowhere for five years:Visa's Dividend DownerBut if you've ignored Visa because of its low yield, you've missed out big time-this ""boring"" chart is actually a sign ofpowerful growth.Because what it's really showing us is that investors have been bidding up V's share price in lockstep with its payout hikes (because you calculate yield by dividing the annual dividend by the current share price).And that dividend growth has been obscene:The Story Yield Doesn't TellThat comes out to a 200% increase over five years! Put it all together, and you can see exactly how those hikes have thrown a relentless lift under the share price, propelling the stock up almost exactly as much as the dividend.An Unmistakable PatternSo if you'd bought in five years ago, you'd actually be sitting on a 215% total return (including dividends) on your Visa shares today. And forget about a 0.69% yield-you'd be reaping 2.3%.Which brings me to the other reason why investors sometimes shun V: its seemingly high forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 26.7. But the truth is, it's averaged almost precisely that over the last five years, when the stock went on its stellar run.5 Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy in MarchThe bottom line? You need to look beyond yield and P/E when picking dividend stocks. Adding two other stats will give you a more complete picture:The payout ratio-or the percentage of earnings paid out as dividends in the last 12 months-is a measly 23%, so V has plenty of dividend-growth juice left. I consider any figure below 50% a sign of a safe dividend (and higher forreal estate investment trusts (REITs), as I'll explain in a moment.Earnings growth:in its fiscal 2017 first quarter, Visa's earnings per share (EPS) jumped 7.5%, to $0.86 from $0.80 a year ago; the Street expected EPS tofallto $0.78. For all of fiscal 2017, analysts see EPS hitting $3.32, up from $2.84 in fiscal '16.4 More Dividend Growers With Big Hikes AheadTo find more stocks ready to set us up for big dividend (and share price) growth in the next five years, I've scanned the market for names with the same telltale signs as Visa.As a kicker, I've also screened for stocks that hiked their dividends around this timelastyear-boosting the odds of a big payout increase (and corresponding pop in the share price) as soon as this spring.Keep in mind that one (LSI) is a REIT, so I've used funds from operations (FFO)-a staple when it comes to measuring REIT performance-rather than EPS for that stock in the last two columns.Here's a closer look at our four picks.The Perfect Business: Life Storage Inc (LSI)Life Storage Inc(LSI) operates 650 self-storage facilities in 29 states. This is one of the best businesses there is: once you build these facilities, you really only have to keep the dust off the shelves and hand out keys.Life's payout ratio is higher than those of our other stocks, at 79.4%. But that's manageable for REITs, which generate steady revenue from their various properties; ratios of 85% to 90% of FFO are common in the REIT world.The trust handed shareholders a 12% dividend hike last March and has plenty of room to do so again: it's forecasting FFO of $5.50 to $5.60 a share this year-and the midpoint of that range is up 28.4% from last year. That's a lot of growth for a very reasonable forward price-to-FFO ratio of 16.0.A Steady Stream of Dividend Growth: American Water Works Company (AWK)American Water Works Company(AWK) provides water and wastewater services in 47 states and drips out double-digit dividend increases like clockwork: last April, it announced a 10.3% hike, following a 9.7% increase in April 2015 and a similar rise the year before that.Before I say more, let me address a contradiction you've likely noticed: AWK's payout ratio. At 57%, it's above my 50% ""safe line.""However, management's calling for earnings of $2.98 to $3.08 this year, up from $2.82 last year (which was itself a 7.6% rise from the year before). If AWK hits the midpoint of that target, the payout ratio would slip back to 49.5%.7 Best Stocks to Buy for a Donald Trump Green LightAnd management's done a solid job of straddling that 50% mark:Like Visa, you shouldn't worry about AWK's forward P/E of 25.6. It's in line with the five-year average and won't cap any upside from the stock's payout growth.The Breakup Play: Sealed Air Corp (SEE)Sealed Air Corp(SEE) is so boring it makes Life Storage look likeApple (AAPL).The company makes packing materials (including bubble wrap) for food, cosmetics and a range of other products.SEE has the slowest dividend growth of our five stocks, because all of it came with last March's hike. Prior to that, the payout hadn't budged since 2010:SEE's Dividend ReignitesThe company disappointed the Street when it forecast adjusted EPS of $2.70 for fiscal 2017, well below the $2.95 analysts were expecting. But that's still up from $2.66 in fiscal 2016.SEE also plans to sell or spin off of its Diversey Care cleaning-product business, which would simplify the company's structure-and should spur the stock.As for the dividend, SEE's steady earnings and low 25.6% payout ratio give it the flexibility to give investors another raise this month, and the forward P/E of 17.3 is still below the five-year average of 17.7.Not Too Late to Buy Travelers Companies Inc (TRV)Travelers Companies Inc(TRV)is a provider of car, home and business insurance that's been around since 1853.I hope you bought this one when Irecommended iton November 21. If so, you're sitting on a 12.3% total return in a little over three months. If not, don't worry. There's another catalyst coming: a double-digit dividend increase.Last April, TRV dropped a 9.8% hike on shareholders, and it's got plenty of room to do more this April, with earnings arcing higher and its payout ratio at just 25.1%.Like all insurers, TRV invests the premiums it collects in interest-bearing securities, so it will profit as interest rates rise.The 7 Best ETFs for Retirement InvestorsThe stock is still reasonably priced at 13.7 times forward earnings. Its dividend hikes and share buybacks (it's taken 28% of its outstanding shares off the market in the last five years) also hand you some nice downside protection.Putting It All TogetherWhen we combine all five of our dividend-growth picks (including Visa) into a diversified portfolio, we see that all have easily beaten the S&P 500 over the past decade on a total-return basis:Clobbering the BenchmarkI think we'll see a similar chart five years out-which makes now a terrific time to buy.6 More Stealth Buys for Double-Digit Gains This YearThese 5 stocks are ripe for buying now … but you can still get the same spectacular growth they offer without sacrificing income today.In fact, I've found a way for you to get at least 7% to 15% price upside in the next 12 monthson top ofan 8.0% current yield.That's a 15% to 23% total return by next March, with a big piece of it locked in-in cash!It comes in the form of the 6 bargain-priced income wonders in my new8.0% ""No-Withdrawal"" retirement portfolio.

The analysts, led by Doug Mitchelson, based their upgrade on better-than-expected improvements toNetflix's subscriber growth in Europe, Latin America and Japan.Mitchelson expects most of the growth from the first two aforementioned countries, while modest growth will come from Japan:""Netflix is certainly well-liked and not inexpensive, but we do see the potential for Netflix to exceed Street subscriber growth expectations and believe that concerns regarding competition and content costs are misplaced. We expect Netflix's original content ramp to continue to drive accelerating international net additions, especially as [Netflix] increases investment in local content overseas and adds more movies and nonfiction genre content.""NFLX stock had gained 12.4% for the year through last Friday, mostly on the strength of itsfourth-quarter figures, which saw the addition of 7.1 million subscribers and guidance of 5.2 million for Q1.8 of the Most Overrated Stocks on Wall Street Right NowAs with Q4, the company expects most of its additions to come from its international markets, where it grew subs by some 5.12 million in the previous quarter, estimating global growth of 3.7 million in Q2.Indeed, Netflix isn't pulling any punches in the international market. The company has lined up somemajor partnerships in India- includingAirtel Digital TVandVodafone Group Plc (ADR)(NASDAQ:VOD) - which allows Netflix to cultivate an audience even without access to smart televisions or other Netflix-enabled set-top boxes. VOD, for its part, boasts more than 200 million subscribers, and will make Netflix content available in prepaid form.Then there's Korea, where the California-based streaming service recently unveiled new original content in the form ofKingdom, billed as a""historical zombie-thriller drama,""its second original Korean show.While international growth has been and continues to be the key driver of growth for Reed Hasting & Co., UBS also noted the role played byComcast Corporation(NASDAQ:CMCSA) in reducing churn for the subscription service. For instance, Xfinity X1 users can integrate Netflix into their regular cable experience without having to switch devices.Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Is Going to Frustrate YouThe NFLX stock upgrade is not without concern, however, as Mitchelson cites the potential of the Republican-controlled Federal Communications Commission to alter the current net neutrality rules in a way that hurts Netflix.Netflix next reports earnings on April 19, with analysts expecting per-share earnings of 37 cents on revenue of $2.64 billion.As of this writing, John Kilhefner did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceGoPro Inc (GPRO) Stock Needs to Be Taken Out SoonIs Under Armour Inc (UAA) Stock a Value, Or Just Cheap?7 Stocks That Will Hit All-Time Highs in 2017The postUBS Says Netflix, Inc.

Is Under Armour Inc (UAA) Stock a Value, Or Just Cheap?;3/6/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIt hasn't been a good 12 months forUnder Armour Inc(NYSE:UAA), to say the least. UAA stock is down by about half, and the company's struggles have been well-documented.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockInvestors had insanely high expectations for Under Armour stock, and analysts set their earnings targets accordingly. That had the natural and unfortunate effect of investors fleeing each time these expectations weren't met.The biggest carnage has come over the past couple quarters. In its recently reported Q4, Under Armour's revenues of $1.31 billion and profits of 23 cents per share fell under estimates for $1.41 billion and 25 cents, respectively. The company's Q3 was better - UAA beat analyst expectations on the top and bottom lines - the day was marred by CEO Kevin Plank telling investors growth was to be less than anticipated going forward.While growth investors have been dumping UAA stock, though, value investors have started sniffing around.So the question now is: Are Under Armour shares a bargain, or just cheap?The Value Case For (And Against) Under Armour StockUnder Armour isn't a great value on many of the traditional metrics, with shares trading at nearly 50 times earnings.

UAA isn't a bargain on the basis of price-to-book or price-to-cash flow, either.5 Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy in MarchWe have to look a little further out for Under Armour stock to be a plausible value investment.UAA laid out plans back in March 2016 to grow the top line about 20% a year to reach $10 billion in sales by 2020. While that growth rate looks to be in jeopardy, the company is still posting some impressive growth. Sales grew by 21% in 2016, with analysts projecting revenue to increase by 11% in 2017 and 15% in 2018.Under Armour also will see a nice uptick in the top line in 2020, when the sports apparel makertakes over Major League Baseball's uniform contract fromMajestic. That deal could kick in sooner if Majestic decides to opt out of its current deal before the deadline.So while UAA stock doesn't have a cheap P/E, and it likely won't for a very long time, if we factor in the company's strong growth potential, we can at least argue that earnings will someday grow enough that you could consider Under Armour a bargain today.Let's assume the bottom line will grow by 20% a year after 2017. This is not an unreasonable assumption because Under Armour stock such a high implied revenue growth rate, and as it gets bigger, it's easier to wring out inefficiencies that crimp the bottom line. There will likely be a greater emphasis on profits going forward as well, rather than revenue.Earnings are expected to be 42 cents per share in 2017. If UAA's bottom line grows by 20% a year, the company will post earnings of 73 cents per share in 2020 and $1.81 per share in 2025. If investors then value Under Armour stock at today's P/E ratio of 49, shares have an implied value of $35.77 in 2020 and $88.69 in 2025.The issue is, of course, will the market continue to value UAA stock at such a high premium?Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Is Going to Frustrate YouIf Under Armour can post great results, growth investors will flock back to it. If it struggles, more impatient investors will likely leave, driving down the valuation further.The Bottom Line on UAA StockIt's hard to consider Under Armour stock a value investment. The company has to post outstanding profit growth for a number of years while continuing to get a premium multiple. That's hard to do.There are still multiple ways an investment in UAA stock could still work out, however.Thecompany could have a few nice quarters, and investors could bump its inflated P/E ratio even higher. Under Armour also could poach a big-name athlete from a competitor likeNikeInc (NYSE:NKE) orAdidas AG (ADR)(OTCMKTS:ADDYY). Heck, it could even be acquired.These are all suitable outcomes, but not terribly likely. And they certainly don't make Under Armour a value investment today.As of this writing, Nelson Smith did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

These Catalysts Will Give the Fintech Industry Its Next Leg Up;3/6/2017;"The financial technologies industry has been one of the few breakout markets over the last 10 years. One of the driving forces behind its growth and quick adoption has been the shift to mobile payments.PayPal Holdings Inc.(PYPL) is still the market leader, which is largely due to its web platform services rather than its mobile wallet apps.In fact, there is a huge debate regarding the penetration of mobile payments amongst consumers as some still question the security of their personal information. Even revolutionary mobile wallets such asApple(AAPL) Pay are yet to gain traction as previously predicted, despite employing the use of fingerprint technology to execute transactions.As such, it appears the initial hype about the industry being revolutionary in the financial payments market has recently stalled.makeArticleAd();Nonetheless, this industry could yet be set for the next leg up thanks to an array of catalysts that seem to be building up behind the scenes. The fintech industry is now more than just about payments. It is stretching its wings to credit, the stock market and traditional banking institutions. These could hold the key to its growth and development over the next few years.Credit and insuranceThis area of the fintech industry is still at the early stages of development with just a few players embracing the paradigm shift in the market. Right now, you can easily get asset finance loans, insurance premium financing and payday loans from various online platforms, including mobile devices and web portals.For instance, Rob Sinclair Equipment is an Australia-based revolutionary asset finance platform that specializes in financing the purchase of equipment in the transport industry. According to the company, the segmentation of the fintech industry could be the key to boosting growth at the consumer level. Rob Sinclair notes more customers are showing the willingness to embrace various aspects of the industry when the companies they deal with specialize in a few segments rather than offering generalized products.In addition, the introduction of mobile applications has opened the doors for financial services companies to bring their products closer to their customers. While mobile wallets are the most popular in that respect, credit and insurance providers are beginning to join in on the action. Most companies are coming in to act as a link between mainstream banking institutions and consumers. With the help of mobile applications, customers can now apply for loans while on the move and get approval within minutes.Blockchain and algorithmic tradingThe stock market is pretty much the leading option when it comes to investing. A few things, however, have changed over the last decade or so. Investors are adapting to new methods of participating in the market and even some of the top hedge funds have started to embrace the change.Algorithmic trading is slowly becoming a norm amongst investors, but a few tweaks still need to be made in order to make it a widely accepted method of trading. Some countries have stiff regulations when it comes to high-frequency trading while security threats still hover for online traders.With many countries now realizing the changes that have been taking place in the stock market over the last few years, however, a more accommodative regulatory framework could be in the making. Additionally, with network technologies such as blockchain already proving reliable, the security threat posed to online traders could be trimmed to the bare minimum.Blockchain is a network infrastructure that has been growing in popularity over the last few years due to the success of various applications such as bitcoin, which run on the network. In fact, giant technology companies likeIBM(IBM) andMicrosoft(MSFT) have already intensified their interest in blockchain technology, which could signal a show of reliability and boost adoption.ConclusionIn summary, while the more popular segments of the fintech industry (online payments led by PayPal and mobile wallets led by Apple Pay) continue to gain traction with the growing adoption of mobile banking, there are a few under the radar business segments in this industry that could trigger the next leg up.The main challenge has been to get customers to feel at ease about linking personal data to some of these technologies, but, as noted, the level of reliability could be boosted when businesses focus on specific segments rather than offering blanket services. Technologies such as blockchain could also play a pivotal role in taking the fintech industry to the next level.Disclosure: I have no position in any stock mentioned in this article.Start afree 7-day trial of Premium Membershipto GuruFocus.Premium MembersThis article first appeared onGuruFocus."

Better Buy: Amazon.com, Inc. vs. Microsoft;3/6/2017;"They're two of the five largest publicly traded companies in   the world. They're technology giants that are increasingly   competing against one another in multibillion-dollar growth   industries such as cloud computing and artificial intelligence.   They'reAmazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) andMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) .And they're vastly different companies in terms of their core   operational focuses, their recent histories, and their cultures.   So which is the better buy today? Let's examine Amazon.com   and Microsoft through three analytical lenses, to determine which   tech stalwart represents the better stock to buy today.Financial fortitudeThough both companies are financial behemoths, Microsoft beats   Amazon in this comparison of financial fortitude. Here's a quick   summary of several important liquidity and solvency measures for   each company.makeArticleAd();CompanyCash and InvestmentsDebtCash From OperationsCurrent RatioMicrosoft$122.7 billion$84.9 billion$36.7 billion2.1Amazon.com$25.9 billion$7.7 billion$16.4 billion1.0Data sources: Amazon.com and Microsoft investor relations,   Yahoo! Finance.Microsoft and Amazon are in fine financial shape. However,   even though Microsoft carries more debt than Amazon, it earns a   win in this category by beating the world's largest e-commerce   provider in three categories. Plus, only $600 million of   Microsoft's borrowings will come due this calendar   year.  The overwhelming majority of Microsoft's debt   comes due after 2020, and then at very low interest rates. Given   the company's cash flow generation capabilities, servicing that   debt should be no issue for Microsoft.It also bears noting that Microsoft, likeApple, keeps the bulk of its cash holdings overseas to shield it from   repatriation taxes. In its most recent 10-Q, the company didn't   disclose how much cash lies offshore, but its annual 10-K filing   showed that it kept approximately 96% overseas. But since it   generates plenty of operating cash flow to fund its domestic and   international operations, this is really a non-issue for   investors.Winner: Microsoft.Durable competitive advantagesMicrosoft and Amazon.com each enjoy competitive advantages,   albeit of different sorts. Amazon's primary moats are its scale   and risk-taking culture. At this point, Microsoft's competitive   insulation seems more structural and historic. Let's unpack each   of those a bit more.Amazon generates the bulk of its sales from its core   e-commerce operations, accounting for 91% of revenue in   2016. As the world's largest e-commerce site by revenue,   Amazon has an incredible scale that allows it to consistently   offer low prices. More impressive still, Amazon's unique ability   to turn its own platform into sources of revenue -- think Amazon   Web Services,Fulfillment by Amazon, third-party ads on Amazon.com, and so on -- allows it to charge   the lowest prices possible on its e-commerce site, which in turn   attracts more customers. This self-regenerating business   philosophy is best summarized in the idea of theFlywheel Effect, which is at the core of Amazon's strategy and touches on its   unique culture.Image Source: Amazon.comTo create a culture that could invent profit centers to buoy   its low- or even negative-margin e-commerce sales, Amazon CEO   Jeff Bezos and his team needed to create a culture where   risk-taking and unconventional thinking were the norm. Bezos   summarized risk-taking's foundational place in Amazon's culture   in the 2015 annual letter:A word about corporate cultures: For better or for worse,     they are enduring, stable, hard to change. ... One area where I     think we are especially distinctive is failure. I believe we     are the best place in the world to fail (we have plenty of     practice!), and failure and invention are inseparable     twins.Without its unique corporate mindset, Amazon never would have   had the audaciousness and vision to launch many of its most   important initiatives, making its culture arguably its most   important asset and source of enduring competitive advantage.Microsoft's source of competitive advantage, on the other   hand, can be summarized in one word: ""Office."" It remains   Microsoft's financial heart and soul and is the largest revenue   source at the company, singlehandedly accounting for $23.5   billion, or 27%, of Microsoft's $85.3 billion in sales in fiscal   2016.CEO Satya Nadella's 2015-16 reorganization of Microsoft's   operations created three new reporting segments: productivity and   business processes (PBP), intelligent cloud, and more personal   computing. PBP houses the consumer and commercial Office   operations, as well as Microsoft's Dynamics CRM platform. The   entire segment generated $26.5 billion of Microsoft's total   sales, so we know, using the Office revenue figure, that Office   drives the segment's performance.Its importance comes into greater focus when looking at   Microsoft's operating-profit breakdown. PBP -- again, mostly   Office -- generated $12.4 billion, or 62%, of Microsoft's   $20.1 billion in fiscal 2016 operating income, making it the   financial bellwether that guides Microsoft's financial   performance.Other segments, particularly Intelligent Cloud, have become   increasingly important pieces of Microsoft's financial footprint   as well. However, Microsoft's core competitive advantage still   lies in the fact that Word, Excel, and PowerPoint make up the   default productivity software for the majority of world's   computer-using population, and that's a source of tremendous   advantage -- and profit -- for the company.Winner: Tie.ValuationComparing the valuations of Microsoft and Amazon isn't the   simplest exercise, given their different growth profiles. With   that in mind, here are three of the most commonly used valuation   metrics for each company.CompanyP/EForward P/EEV/EBITDAMicrosoft30.219.716.8Amazon.com173.766.134.1EV = ENTERPRISE VALUE. EBITDA = EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST,   TAXES, DEPRECIATION, AND AMORTIZATION. Data source: Yahoo!   Finance.Here we get a great comparison of two investing styles --   growth versus value. Neither comes out ahead here. More   conservative investors who prefer to own stocks with something of   a margin of safety will probably be drawn to Microsoft, with its   more conservative valuation and 2.3% dividend yield. Of   course, those same investors have always argued that Amazon is   overvalued, even as the company's stock ascends ever higher.From the perspective of a long-term investor, I believe   Amazon's ability to grow at above-average rates for years, if not   decades to come, will enable it to grow into and beyond its   current valuation. Microsoft's main issue, meanwhile, remains its   growth outlook.This analysis is somewhat subjective. More risk-averse   investors, particularly those nearing retirement, might want to   stay away from Amazon stock. However, for those with the ability   to buy and hold a company for a decade or more, I like Amazon   despite its aggressive valuation today.Winner: Tie.And the winner is... Amazon, by a noseBoth Amazon and Microsoft offer investors attractive   investment opportunities, in very different ways. As I mentioned,   Microsoft is probably a better option for more risk-averse   investors. It's a stable, mature company and should derive the   bulk of its financial returns from growing profits and EPS,   rather than through rapidly expanding its top line. Amazon's   growth trajectory, meanwhile, is generational, as it looks to   rewrite the rules of the global retail industry. In the end,   Amazon strikes me as the better stock for long-term investors to   buy today.10 stocks we like better than MicrosoftWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Stocks recently featured in the blog includeAmazon.com Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN-Free Report),Google(NASDAQ:GOOGL-Free Report),Facebook(NASDAQ:FB-Free Report) andApple(NASDAQ:AAPL-Free Report).Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations.Get #1Stock of the Day pick for free.Here are highlights from Friday's Analyst Blog:Amazon to Install Solar Panels to Power DatacentersThe world is fast shifting to alternative energy and this is spurring demand for solar panels.E-commerce giantAmazon.com Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN-Free Report) is gearing up for its next project associated with renewable energy initiatives. This time, the firm will harness solar energy by installing solar panels on the roof of its fulfillment facilities across the world.Coming to the price performance, over the past year, shares of Amazon outperformed the Zacks categorized Electronic Commerce industry. While the industry gained 39.53%, the stock returned 45.91%.DetailsAs part of its commitment to advance green power, Amazon has plans of deploying large-scale solar systems on rooftops of more than 15 fulfillment and sortation centers in the U.S. this year. By 2020, around 50 data centers are expected to use solar energy to meet their power needs.Amazon said that these solar panels could generate up to 80% of the annual energy requirements of a fulfillment center depending on the project, time of year and other factors. The company already has a network of wind and solar farms in Indiana, North Carolina, Ohio and Virginia. Its largest wind farm is in Texas.Amazon's senior vice president of Worldwide Operations, Dave Clark, said ""As our fulfillment network continues to expand, we want to help generate more renewable energy at both existing and new facilities around the world in partnership with community and business leaders.""Focus on Carbon NeutralityThis initiative by Amazon is the latest in a string of clean energy investments made by U.S. technology giants in recent months. For quite some time, Amazon has been moving away from fossil fuels and focusing more on clean energy. It aims at reducing its carbon footprint and using more renewable energy to power its huge data centers. Moreover, the company can generate healthy returns from these solar and wind investments as there are many associated tax incentives.Infact many corporate behemoths including Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL-Free Report), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB-Free Report) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL-Free Report) are progressively moving toward alternative energy sources to lower their overall carbon emissions and cut their energy bills substantially.Also, several countries are increasingly relying on solar power to generate clean energy. Stringent environmental legislations on greenhouse gas emissions have also proved to be a boon for the solar power sector. Moreover, despite high initial investments, low operational costs and no fuel costs make these solar investments attractive.Amazon.com, Inc. Price and Consensus|Amazon.com, Inc.

How Apple Could Spend Its Cash Hoard;3/6/2017;"The problem ofApple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) cash balance is a ""first-world problem"" in   the most literal sense of the phrase.Slightly larger than the annual economic output of Chile,   Apple's cash and marketable securities stockpile lies largely   overseas. As of the company's most recent earnings report, $230   billion of Apple's $246 billion, roughly 93%, was held in   accounts controlled by Apple's international subsidiaries.Apple has caused quite a stir thanks to its controversial   decision to park its foreign profits abroad rather than pay what   it argues are onerous and unfair repatriation taxes. However, the   whiff of tax policy overhaul percolating on Capitol Hill means   this dynamic could soon change. In anticipation of such a   scenario -- and in part because it's just fun to consider -- here   are three realistic ways Apple could deploy its billions in the   bank in the years ahead.makeArticleAd();Image source: Apple.Idea 1: Major acquisitionApple being a mature company, you often see investors float   the idea of the Mac maker using its cash to fund a major   acquisition whenever this discussion appears. The idea isn't   without merit, either, although it is more complex than it might   seem on the surface for a few reasons.The first hurdle lies in correctly identifying a large company   that jives with Apple's plans for its own future. In terms of   companies that I (subjectively) think could conceivably pair well   with Apple, only a handful of plausible candidates come to mind.   Among them areTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) ,Netflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) , andComcast(NASDAQ: CMCSA) (NASDAQ: CMCSK), three legitimately viable   options among publicly traded companies.We know Apple is interested in -- or possibly in the midst of   --developing an electric vehiclefrom the many leaks about its Project Titan, though we don't know   much more than that. Tesla makes the most sense among automakers   for a few reasons. Much like Apple, Tesla's mission is to   fundamentally alter the industries in which it operates. Its   headquarters in California would make working together simpler   than coordinating across the country with Detroit.In a similar vein, Comcast and Netflix both cater to Apple's   long-held desire to launch its own content streaming service.   Apple's ability to secure content rights from major producers has   been the main thorn in its side. Both Netflix and Comcast control   considerable content rights, though Netflix is newer to this   game. As such, owning either Comcast or Netflix could supply   Apple with the negotiating leverage it needs to finally bring the   required parties to the table.Unfortunately, acquiring any of these companies would require   Apple pay a significant premium to their current prices, which   could be particularly troubling for already-expensive stocks like   Netflix and Tesla. There are also integration, cultural, and   regulatory considerations that could make such a maneuver highly   complex for Apple, though the idea isn't entirely without   merit.Idea 2: More capital return?This comes from the ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"" school   of thought since Apple has thus far used its cash reserves to   finance its dividends and share buybacks. To do so, Apple has   cleverly used its overseas riches as collateral to borrow against   to fund its massive capital return programto great effect.Apple has paid out a whopping $201 billion of its current $250   billion capital return program as of its most recent earnings   report, including $15 billion in dividends and buybacks in its   latest quarter (Q1 FY 2017). Apple generated $27 billion in   operating cash flow last year, and its capex requirements are   minimal -- $3 billion last quarter. This makes the status quo   seem sustainable, although the recent rally inApple stockmakes this option increasingly less appealing.AAPL PE Ratio (TTM)data byYCharts.Stock buybacks become less effective as a company'svaluation increases, so Apple's dramatic multiple expansion has made this tactic   less attractive than it was a year ago. However, with Apple still   trading at a discount to the market, and its cash balance rising,   there's certainly a fair case to be made that further buybacks   and dividends remain a worthy use of Apple's riches.Idea 3: Finance important capex?If Project Titan is indeed real, I think the chances of Apple   implementing this third idea are quite strong. One of the most   important questions Apple must answer along the way is how will   it manufacture the electric vehicle?As I havenotedin the past, automobile manufacturing is a capital-intensive,   low-margin business. This leaves Apple facing a potential   catch-22 with Project Titan, driving meaningful sales growth   while also dramatically eroding its now-cushy profit margins in   the process.Perhaps the best solution to this problem is to follow a   tactic similar to Apple's contract manufacturing arrangements   with Asian assembly specialistsFoxconn. Apple designs products and maintains quality control, but it   hands over the actual widget-making, the low-margin part of the   process, to someone else. This is how the majority of Apple's   consumer electronics get made today.The key speed bump with this idea is that there are no   large-scale automotive contract manufacturers that exist today to   provide this service to Apple, and that's where Apple's mountains   of money come into play. Assuming it finds a willing and capable   partner to build Project Titan, Apple could use its cash to   finance the construction of the factory infrastructure necessary   to bring Project Titan to life.In fact, Apple has pursued a similar strategy in the past. It   partnered with the now-defunct GT Advanced Technologies to   finance the construction of a factory that GT Advanced planned to   use to produce commercial sapphire for Apple's fingerprint   scanners. If it does so, Apple will want to take great care to   avoid past mistakes, like bankrupting GT Advanced under the   onerous terms of its financing deal. Regardless, this idea is   sound as long as Apple's auto ambitions are indeed as real as   portrayed in the media.Cash is kingOf course, this only scratches the surface in terms of   possible uses of Apple's cash. U.S. tax policy overhaul will also   have a significant influence on Apple's options, so interested   investors will want to stay in tune with the national discussion   around it in the coming months. At the end of the day, though,   Apple's billions in the bank provide it with unparalleled   flexibility to pursue any number of possible actions, and that's   something in which Apple investors can and should find great   comfort.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Monday’s Vital Data: Bank of America Corp (BAC), Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD);3/6/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsU.S. stock futures are pointed lower this morning, as hawkish commentary from the Federal Reserve clashes with geopolitical concerns rising from a North Korean missile test over the weekend. A growing chorus on Wall Street remains concerns that markets have risen too far too fast, and that a correction is due, which could be kicked off by a rate hike at the coming Federal Open Market Committee meeting.makeArticleAd();Against this backdrop, futures on theDow Jones Industrial Averagehave dipped 0.12%, whileS&P 500futures are down 0.23% andNasdaq-100futures are off 0.16%.On the options front, Friday's session saw volume return to normal levels for the week. Roughly 15.7 million calls and 14.1 million puts changed hands. Turning to the CBOE, the single-session equity put/call volume ratio arrived at 0.70, with the 10-day moving average rising to 0.63.Turning to Friday's volume leaders, increased expectations for a Fed rate hike bolstered call option activity forBank of America Corp(NYSE:BAC) on Friday, whileApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) calls were in focus following the latest data on Apple Watch sales. Finally,Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMD) saw call options volume falter alongside the shares amid a flurry of unfavorable Ryzen reviews.Bank of America Corp. (BAC)Higher interest rates mean higher revenue for Bank of America, and investors are expecting the Fed to hike rates once more in March. According to fed fund futures, as tracked by CME Group, the market is pricing in a 79.7% chance of a 0.75 to 1.00 point hike in the Federal Reserve's key lending rate. Another rate hike could mean billions more in revenue for Bank of America from its investing and loan issuing units.7 Telecom Stocks That Are High-Yield Money TrapsFollowing Fed ChairYellen's statement on Fridaythat a March rate hike was ""likely appropriate,"" options traders once again flooded BAC stock with call options. Total volume ballooned to more than 1.1 million contracts, with calls snapping up 68% of the day's take.What's more, the March put/call open interest ratio has declined steadily during the past several weeks, falling to a bullish perch of 0.48 on Friday. In other words, call options now more than double put options among all contracts set to expire at the close of trading next Friday - i.e. those most affected by any potential Fed rate hike on March 15.Apple Inc. (AAPL)AAPL call options were also quite popular on Friday. The bullish sentiment was derived from a report stating that Apple just recorded itsbest fourth-quarter Apple Watch sales figures ever. While independent data noted that the overall wearables market was hitting a rough patch due to lack of global expansion, Apple closed the gap considerably with wearables leaderFitbit Inc(NYSE:FIT).In the options pits, AAPL saw volume rise to 839,000 contracts on Friday, with calls snapping up 63% of the day's take. AAPL has emerged as the best-performing stock on theDow Jones Industrial Averagein 2017, rallying nearly 20% since the start of the year, and options traders have set their sights on $140 by the end of next week.Specifically, nearly 34,000 calls are currently open at the March $140 strike, compared to peak put OI of 50,000 contracts at the March $130 strike. These latter put options are likely of the ""put sell"" variety, designed to capture premium off technical support for rising AAPL shares.Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD)The embargo period is up, and the official reviews are in on AMD's Ryzen CPU … and the hype is all but dead. AMD soared more than 25% from January through the middle of last week on expectations that Ryzen would more than compete with everything inIntel Corporation's(NASDAQ:INTC) lineup, butreviews last weekseverely undermined much of that hype. AMD has since plunged more than 19% amid a deluge of profit taking following Ryzen's release.Citigroup Inc (C) Stock Aiming for $68Options traders appear to be holding out hope for a rebound, however. Friday's activity revealed that calls made up 57% of the more than 724,000 contracts traded on AMD stock. However, the March put/call open interest ratio has risen sharply to its current perch at 0.80 after tagging a near-term low of 0.62 early last week.On the call side, traders have their sights set on the March $14 strike, with OI of more than 17,000 contracts. Meanwhile put trades have zeroed in on AMD's March $13.50 strike, where some 13,500 contracts are already trading firmly in the money.As of this writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace5 Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy in March10 Dangerous Dividend Stocks to Dump NowThe postMonday's Vital Data: Bank of America Corp (BAC), Apple Inc.

Best Stocks Warren Buffett Is Buying in 2017;3/5/2017;"Warren Buffett is arguably the greatest investor of our time,   and that makes knowing what stocks he's buying forBerkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK-A) (NYSE: BRK-B)  must-know news. In the fourth   quarter, Buffett added a bunch ofApple Inc.(NASDAQ: AAPL)  andDelta Air Lines(NYSE: DAL)  to his portfolio, and recently, he told CNBC   that he's spent about $20 billion of Berkshire Hathaway's cash   stockpile buying these and other stocks since ""a little before   the election."" He also revealed that his position in both Apple   and airline stocks is bigger now than it was in December.Profits by the bushelAfter consumers opted to hold off on upgrading their iPhones,   Apple shares stumbled early in 2016, and that proved to be the   perfect opportunity for Berkshire Hathaway portfolio managers   Todd Combs and Ted Weschler to pick up shares of the electronics   giant at a discount.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.makeArticleAd();Berkshire Hathaway invested $1 billion inApple stockin the first quarter of 2016 -- a fairly modest stake for a   portfolio with $150 billion under management. However, that stake   climbed significantly throughout the remainder of the year, and   exiting December, Berkshire Hathaway's Apple position was worth   about $7.7 billion, making it Buffett's sixth biggest individual   stock position.This week, Buffett appeared on CNBC to discuss Berkshire   Hathaway's performance last year, and in his conversation, he let   it slip that his interest in Apple continued into this year.   Although Apple was already a big holding entering this year,   Buffett says he now owns 133 million shares in Apple, making it   his second biggest holding.Apple's shares have rallied sharply since they first showed up   in Buffett's portfolio, so it's safe to assume that Berkshire   Hathaway is sitting on a nice gain on Apple's stock. He reminded   CNBC viewers he could sell at any point, but I think there's   reason to think he'll hold on to his Apple position for a   while.Last quarter, iPhone, Mac, Apple Watch, and services sales all   reached record highs, and as a result, Apple's revenue and profit   finished 2016 on a high note. Revenue in its fiscal first quarter   was a record $78.4 billion, up from $75.9 billion last year, and   earnings per share were $3.36, up from $3.28 a year   ago. Apple's management is guiding investors to expect   between $51.5 billion and $53.5 billion in sales this quarter, up   between 1.7% and 5.7% year over year.With operating cash flow of $27 billion allowing management to   return $15 billion to investors last year through share buybacks   and dividend payments, and business humming along nicely, it   wouldn't be surprising if Apple returns even more money to   investors this year.Growing exposure to airlinesWhen it comes to rewarding investors with market-beating   returns, airlines have a rocky history. However, an industrywide   restructuring a few years ago is boosting profit, and that's   making airlines some of the market's top performers. If the U.S.   economy continues to strengthen, then fuller flights will help   keep prices firm, and investments in fuel-efficient airplanes   will drop even more money to the bottom line.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.In the past, Buffett has said that one way to become a   millionaire is to start out as a billionaire and then invest in   an airline. He doesn't seem to believe that anymore. Over the   past six months, he's invested billions of Berkshire Hathaway's   cash into the stock of the country's largest airline   operators.As of December, Berkshire Hathaway owned 60 million shares in   Delta Air Lines worth roughly $3 billion, plus he owns about $2.5   billion inSouthwest Airlines, and about $2.1 billion in each ofAmerican AirlinesandUnited Continental Holdings. Overall, Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has invested over $9   billion in airlines.Although he didn't say exactly what airlines he's adding more   to in 2017, he didn't deny that he's continuing to increase his   bet on the industry. When he was asked if he's spending more   money on Appleandairlines this year, he said that was a ""good guess.""Clearly, he thinks airline stocks are going to go up, not   down, and with unemployment low and incomes rising, it's not a   stretch to to think that airlines like Delta will continue to   fill seats. If so, these companies could reward investors with   bigger profits and, in turn, higher dividend payments.For instance, Delta Air Lines' goal is to return about 70% of   its annual free cash flow to investors, and while a lot of that   cash flow could be used for share buybacks, a low dividend payout   ratio and cash dividend payout ratio suggest there's room to   increase quarterly dividend payments, too.Currently, Delta Air Lines' dividend payout ratio -- or   the percentage of earnings paid to shareholders   in dividends -- is less than 12%. American Airlines and   Southwest's ratios are even lower. That's pretty low when you   consider that other big companies are paying out far more to   investors. For example,General Electric's payout ratio is 75%.With Warren Buffett owning a big and potentially growing   position in airlines, and an opportunity for investors to pocket   bigger dividend payments, it might be time to buy stock in these   companies.10 stocks we like better than Delta Air LinesWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

3 Worst Performing Stocks in February;3/5/2017;"For a month in which the Dow Jones Industrial Average   regularly set new highs and closed in on the 21,000 level,   February also featured a surprising number of stocks whose   performance downright stunk.I ran a screen to identify the worst stocks from the S&P   500 in February. The bottom three performers wereSouthwestern Energy(NYSE: SWN) ,Fossil Group(NASDAQ: FOSL) , andUnder Armour(NYSE: UA) (NYSE: UAA) . Let's see why they sucked as bad as they   did, and consider what it would take to turn those declines   around in the near term -- if they can.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();Southwestern Energy: Down 22.3%Sure, a few parts of the country were hit with winter storms   that dumped some snow accumulation on them, but large swathes of   the U.S. were basking in unseasonably warm temperatures last   month. The mild weather has depressednatural   gas prices; the Energy Information Administration said Henry Hub spot   pricing fell from $2.92 per million British thermal units (MMBtu)   to $2.53 per MMBtu in the most current weekly report. And though   net withdrawals are some 7% above the five-year average for this   time of year, they remain 10% below the year-ago average.That makes it difficult for a natural gas and oil driller like   Southwestern Energy to profitably produce energy, and the   company's fourth quarter earnings results last week justify why   its share prices have largely been trending down since October.   Even though it was able to turn a loss a year ago into a profit   of $0.08 per share this time around, itwidely missedanalysts' consensus expectation of $0.12 per share.Despite the depressed pricing environment, Southwestern and   other drillers insist they will keep on pumping out more supply.   Indeed, the EIA expected total production from the seven shale   regions of the U.S. to reach an all-time high of 48.6 billion   cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) in February, to be followed by a new   record of 49.1 Bcf/d in March.That doesn't bode well for profitable pricing in the future,   but Southwestern Energy has improved its balance sheet since last   year, putting it in better shape financially. It still might be   difficult, though, for it to shake off its troubles anytime soon,   considering the spring fever that now looks likely to consume the   rest of this winter.Image source: Fossil.Fossil Group: Down 23%The weather map might be showing warmer temps, but it's been   downright chilly for watchmaker Fossil Group, which has lost   nearly a quarter of its value in February alone, and is down by   more than 60% from the highs it hit back in November. The problem   is not so many people wear traditional timepieces anymore, so   sales in that segment are falling at a faster rate than could be   compensated for by any potential pickup in new, so-called smart   watches.Though itbeat analysts' expectationsfor the fourth quarter, its outlook for the coming year was   brutal -- hence the frosty reception its report got from the   market. It's anticipating its sales in 2017 will at best be flat   compared to 2016, but warns they could fall as much as 6.5%.   Worse, Fossil at the bottom of its forecast range could produce a   loss of as much as $0.50 per share, though if its most optimistic   scenario plays out, it might be able to earn a profit of $0.20 a   share. That kind of a wide forecast -- big enough to drive a   truck through -- indicates that not even management understands   its industry all that well.These are changing times, and Fossil's choice to hitch its   wagon to the smartwatch horse may not pay off as expected.   According to the market researchers at IDC, total smartwatch   sales volumes plunged 51.6% in 2016's third quarter, falling to   2.7 million units shipped from the 5.6 million units shipped in   the prior year. While many people may have held off on buying   smartwatches while waiting for the 2.0 version of theAppleWatch -- which was only available for the last two weeks of the   quarter -- those numbers still suggest weak demand.Moreover, others likeFitbitare expanding into the full-feature smartwatch niche too, meaning   the space will only get more crowded, and any growth Fossil gains   from it could be very disappointing.Image source: Under ArmourUnder Armour: Down 24.4%Talk about catching a chill: Under Armour's stock has lost a   quarter of its value in February. Beyond that, it's also been cut   in half over the past year, and is down 60% from its 52-week   high. It's stumbling so much these days, it's almost as if   someone tied the apparel maker'sshoelaces together.Sales are slowing, its new designs have been mocked, and   management alienated investors, first by splitting its stock to   dilute shareholder voting rights, then when its CEO publicly   praised President Trump. Reaction to that latter transgression   was apparently so severe the company took out a full-page   newspaper ad to apologize for it.Yet despite all that, Under Armour stock still trades at 43   times trailing earnings and 36 times estimates, meaning it still   has a long, long way to fall before it hits bottom, or before   investors think it's due for a recovery. Considering Under Armour   has traded at relative nosebleed valuations all along, the market   may be wrong about its chances for a quick rebound.Increasingly, Under Armour isplacing its betson footwear to drag it back to growth. Last year, that segment   generated more than a fifth of its revenues, but its plan to   expand market share there is going to put it on a collision   course with industry leaderNike, which -- despite fumbling its own recent moves forward -- still   owns the lion's share of the footwear market, and a newly   resurgentSkechers, which has surprised everyone recently with its strength.Although the stock does trade at a fraction of its sales,   Under Armour is also priced like a premium company that's been   putting its best foot forward. But it's actually been maneuvering   like it has two left feet, and it may trip over itself yet again   before it finally picks itself up.10 stocks we like better than Under Armour (C   Shares)When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Apple Inc. (AAPL) Apple Music Just Can’t Catch Spotify;3/4/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsApple Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AAPL) Apple Music is a success by all counts, but one target still remains elusive.makeArticleAd();Despite impressive subscriber gains since its 2015 launch, AAPL's streaming music service has been unable to catch primary rivalSpotify. And in the latest sign that the competition is far from over, Spotify just announced it has hit the 50 million paid subscriber mark.Spotify Hits 50 Million Paid SubscribersApple Music and Spotify are considered to be the two big players in the streaming music war.Spotify launched in 2008, giving it a long lead in which to build up steam over Apple Music, which didn't go live until 2015. Despite that head start - and predictions that after its initial free three-month trial expired, Apple's streaming music service would see a big drop off of subscribers - Apple Music quickly began to gain obliterate Spotify's numbers.Apple Music hit 10 million paid subscribers after just six months,a milestone that took Spotify nearly six years to reach. Since then,Apple Music has continued to add paid subscribers at a rapid pace: 11 million by last February, 13 million in April, 17 million in September and 20 million in December.Apple Inc. (AAPL) Posts Best Q4 Apple Watch Sales EverHowever, despite the rapidly increasing popularity of Apple's streaming music service, Spotify stubbornly refuses to go away. In fact, rather than stalling or beginning to slip as many expected, Spotify's numbers have also been growing strongly.Spotify had roughly 20 million paid subscribers at the time Apple Music launched. This week, the company announced it hashit 50 million.In other words, Spotify is not going anywhere any time soon.A Little More CompetitionWhile the big streaming music battle has been between Apple Music and Spotify, many other competitors are duking it out for the dollars of music fans. And rather than scare off new entrants, the success of Apple Music led to a big new competitor taking a shot at the business.Amazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN)launched Amazon Music Unlimited last fall, matching Apple Music's basic subscription rates. But Amazon added a twist by discounting the service for Amazon Prime members and slashing it it less than half the regular $9.99 monthly fee for owners of its Amazon Echo smart speaker.Will Apple Music Ever Catch Spotify? (And Does It Need to?)The success of Apple Music isn't just about bragging rights.The streaming music service is part of Apple's Services division. That division is increasingly important to the bottom line. It provides recurring revenue, which helps to protect against shocks when hardware sales hit rough patches. In AAPL's most recent quarter, Services posted thestrongest year-over-year growth of any of Apple's divisions.2016 revenue numbers for Spotify aren't yet available, but the music streaming service has consistently lost money, including $176.9 million in 2014 and $188.7 million. Thesituation looked grim a year ago, with Apple Music growing rapidly. However, big increases in paid subscriber drove a revenue gain of80% to $2.12 billion. That marked a turning point in the outlook for Spotify's survival.With profitability a distinct possibility in 2017, Spotify could be in acquisition territory.Alphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL) andFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) have both been floated aspotential buyers. An initial public offering could also be in its future.Apple Inc. (AAPL) iPhone 8 Lightning Port Drama ContinuesRegardless, Apple Music seems unlikely to knock Spotify off the top of the streaming music charts, at least not in the near future.That doesn't mean Apple Music isn't a success. It quickly vaulted from zero to a contender for top spot in mere months and has continued to grow. As shown by the number of streaming music services that continue to attract paid subscribers, there is still plenty of room for multiple big players to make money.Apple Music will continue to drive revenue into AAPL's Services division, even if that coveted No. 1 spot remains elusive.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceFriday Apple Rumors: iPhone Delay, Qualcomm Lawsuit and iOS FeatureApple Inc.

What Will Warren Buffett Buy Next With His $86 Billion War Chest?;3/4/2017;"According toBerkshire Hathaway's(NYSE: BRK-A) (NYSE: BRK-B) latest annual report, Warren Buffett   and his team are sitting on an $86 billion stockpile of cash.   While the Oracle of Omaha likes to keep at least $20 billion in   cash or equivalents on the sidelines at all times, this still   leaves a lot of money just waiting to be put to work. We have no   way of knowing exactly what Berkshire will buy next, but we do   know what the company is looking for.Berkshire's cash hoard is different than most othersBerkshire Hathaway is not the only company with a massive cash   hoard, and it is certainly not the biggest. The tech sector in   particular has several players with big stockpiles of cash, such   asApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) ,Microsoft,Alphabet,Cisco, andOracle.Image Source: The Motley Fool.makeArticleAd();However, these companies have most their cash stashed   overseas, and can't bring it back without facing a large tax   bill. In fact, Moody's estimates that about 87% of these five   tech giants' cash is stashed overseas.Berkshire Hathaway, on the other hand, doesn't have this   problem to worry about. 95% of Berkshire's $86 billion stockpile   of cash is held by U.S. entities. And, the remaining 5% would   trigger big repatriation taxes, as most of it was earned in   companies that impose big corporate taxes, which would be used to   offset U.S. taxes upon repatriation of the cash.In a nutshell, not only does Berkshire have $86 billion in   cash, but this is cash that can actually be used without major   tax consequences.How Berkshire Hathaway chooses its acquisition targetsThe exact process Warren Buffett and his team use to evaluate   potential acquisition targets is a closely guarded secret.   However, Berkshire Hathaway does actively encourage prospective   acquisitions to contact the company, so long as the business   meets six criteria:The business must be large. Berkshire defines this as     having at least $75 million of pre-tax earnings per year. The     company will make an exception if it can fit into one of its     existing business units.The company must be able to demonstrate that it is     consistently profitable. Buffett and his team have no interest     in investing in unprofitable companies or companies that may or     may not become profitable.The business must have little or no debt and still produce     good returns on equity.There must already be management in place. I'd add to this     and say that there must begood management in place. I can't     emphasize enough the value Buffett places on good     managers.The business must be simple. Buffett doesn't invest in tech     companies or biotechs or anything else that he doesn't     understand.There must be an offering price on the table, even if it's     just preliminary.Berkshire's target acquisition range is $5 to $20 billion.   This is not a set-in-stone rule, as the company has certainly   made exceptions in the past. However, the larger the company the   greater Berkshire's interest will be.It would be foolish to speculate as to which exact company   Buffett and his team may buy next. However, it is fair to say   that was such a large stockpile of cash, Brookshire will be on   the prowl for an acquisition that meets its criteria.Or, will Buffett and company buy more stocks instead?In addition to its fully owned businesses, Berkshire Hathaway   has a stock portfolio consists of about 45 different companies as   of this writing. The stocks that Warren Buffett is buying and   selling are closely followed by millions of investors.We already know for a fact that some of Berkshire's cash hoard   is being spent on common stocks in 2017. In an interview with   CNBC, Buffett revealed that since the start of the year,   Berkshire has more than doubled its stake in Apple,and now owns   about 2.5% of the tech giant.Just like with Berkshire's acquisitions of entire companies,   it would be silly to speculate on what stocks Buffett and his   team will buy next, but the reasons behind the Apple investment   are a good example of what he looks for.Buffett said that he decided to boost Berkshire's Apple stake   because of the company's consumer-retaining power. After all,   people who use iPhones typically upgrade to a newer model of the   same product -- over and over. Buffett also praised CEO Tim   Cook's capital deployment strategies. In addition, Apple trades   for a relatively low valuation when compared with the rest of the   market, and looks cheaper still if you account for the company's   massive stockpile of cash.What it means to youAs I've mentioned before, it would be silly to try to figure   out what companies are stocks Berkshire Hathaway will buy next.   However, you can use the principles and rules discussed here to   find Buffett-like stocks for your own portfolio.10 stocks we like better than Berkshire     HathawayWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Believe It or Not, Apple Came in Dead Last in Customer Loyalty in This $24 Billion Market;3/3/2017;"Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) knows what it's doing. The company is a market   leader in many fields, and would often rather abandon a product   category rather than struggle on as a minor competitor to bigger   and better rivals.But even mighty Apple does the occasional swing-and-a-miss   routine. And some of Cupertino's whiffs come in vibrant   billion-dollar markets.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();Apple ranks dead last in the $24 billion file-hosting   marketBrand Keysis a branding consultancy firm with more than three decades of   expertise-building history under its belt. The firm is best known   for its Customer Loyalty Engagement Index (CLEI) rankings, where   a proprietary data-collection process builds customer-loyalty   ratings in more than 80 specific product categories.Apple, of course, dominates several of the latest Brand Keysratings. The iPhone shows up all comers in the smartphone category, no   tablet can beat the iPad's consumer loyalty, and MacBooks walks   away with the top rating among laptop brands. In something of an   upset,Apple Musiceven takes home the online music segment.And then there's the file-storage category. There, Apple   doesn't just miss the top spot, but falls all the way to the   bottom of 13 ranked services.How bad is that result for Apple?To be clear, Brand Keys claims that its measurements translate   directly into future sales prospects and revenues. According to   independent metrics fromMarkets and Markets, cloud storage is a $24 billion market today -- and expected to   reach annual sales of $75 billion in just five years.In other words, it looks like Apple is leaving a lot of cash   on the table. The iCloud file-storage service is not pulling its   weight, or moving the needle for Apple. Instead, consumers with a   need for off-site file-storage tools prefer free services like   Brand Keys' category winner, Sabrecat -- or a plethora of   better-known options such as runner-up Dropbox, or third-place   finisherGoogle(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Drive.Apple is not only missing a significant market opportunity,   but leaving a lot of that cash for Google parent Alphabet to grab   instead.Apple CEO Tim Cook. Image source: Apple.Why is Apple missing the boat?Apple's iCloud is, in many ways, very similar to Google Drive   and Dropbox. All three services allow users to store nearly any   type of file in a centrally managed cloud server, accessible from   any networked computer. They all come with small storage limits   for a free account, all offer a terabyte of storage for $9.99 per   month, and come with various tools for managing your stored   files. But Apple does a few things differently.First and foremost, the easiest way to access iCloud content   is via an iPhone, iPad, or MacBook. In fact, signing up for an   iCloud account is part of the setup process for all of these   systems. Then, the service is integrated into your Apple   experience as the destination for system backup files, the   default storage location for files created in the iWork office   suite, and an option for storing user files in newer versions of   the macOS system.All of this is designed to keep users tightly bound to Apple's   multi-device ecosystem. Once you're in, it's not easy to get   untangled. Given Apple's massive market reach, especially in the   tablet and smartphone segments, this alone should make iCloud a   winner. Apple CEO Tim Cook introduced the package as ""a strategy   for the next decade"" in 2012.However, Apple never quite delivered on that grand ambition.   iCloud is reportedly ostracized by other working groups within   the company, starved of resources, and mostly seen as a necessary   evil. Apple is a product company, and iCloud is not a marketable   product on its own -- at least not in its current Apple-centric   form. So, this odd piece of infrastructure machinery is left out   in the cold.And there goes Apple's ticket to a $24 billion industry that's   also on a rapid growth tear.Google sure is building its Drive product into everything from   Gmail to mobile photo storage to storage space for corporate   accounts. Dropbox is doing the same, while on the lookout for   another buyout bid. And this market should only grow faster as   theInternet of Thingsgrows up, requiring acres of cloud-based storage space. These   companies treat online file storage as an important business,   valuable on its own merits.Apple doesn't. Hence, the company is holding back on promoting   iCloud, developing it further, or building it into other   products, when appropriate. Cupertino misses out on a major   growth story, with absolutely no loyalty from the customers who   do sign up.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

3 Closed-End Funds With Sky-High Yields of 10% or More;3/3/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsClosed-end funds have become a kind of alternative vehicle to gobble up high yields, ever since the Federal Reserve wiped out the bond market as a source for fixed income.makeArticleAd();Source:401(K) 2012 via FlickrCEFsoperate like a cross between a stock and mutual fund. CEFs raise equity via an IPO. The proceeds are then used to execute the desired investment strategy for the fund, and a limited and finite number of shares are issued. Thus, it trades like a stock but operates more like a mutual fund or exchange-traded fund ,since they hold a basket of securities.The trick withCEFsis finding the ones that are well-managed, that offer commensurate reward to whatever risks they are taking.The 7 Best ETFs for Market-Beating ReturnsSo here are three different types of CEFs that are a bit riskier than I personally like, but offer acceptable 10%-plus yields for those who don't mind that extra risk.Closed-End Funds to Buy: Eaton Vance Risk-Managed Diversified Equity Inc. (ETJ)Distribution Rate:11%Eaton Vance Risk-Mngd Dvrsfd Eqty Inc Fd(NYSE:ETJ) is pretty much what it is described as, although its title doesn't mention its core strategy, which is selling covered calls. I like ETJ because it takes a very similar approach that my forthcoming stock advisory newsletter,The Liberty Portfolio, takes. It buys certain high-quality stocks and then sells covered calls against them.ETJ buys stocks likeApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL),Microsoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) andVisa, Inc.(NYSE:V) and sells covered calls against them. That means they sell contracts for another party to buy that stock from the fund at a given price on or before a given day. Obviously, if the stock is below that price, the fund keeps the stock and can sell more calls. Most importantly, it holds stocks that are quality companies, so if the market tanks and they get stuck with those stocks … well, there are worse things.The distribution rate is 11% and it currently trades at more than a 9% discount to net asset value.Closed-End Funds to Buy: Pimco High Income Fund (PHK)Distribution Rate:11%Pimco High Income Fund(NYSE:PHK) is one of the best CEFs that I have found, in regards to diversification. PHK has 343 holdings across many different kinds of bonds. While half are corporate bonds, 27% are asset-backed, 12.5% are municipals and 5% are government bonds, and they are spread across just about every kind of sector that exists. Maturities are also diversified, with a healthy 38% maturing in 1-4 years, 25% in 5-9 years, 16% in 10-20 years, and the rest are longer-term.The average coupon is 7.95%, but manages to distribute about 10.9% annually, thanks to capital gains. Since inception, its annualized total returns are 13.8%, almost twice that of the 7.4% category benchmark. That's also a major reason why the PHK trades at a 30% premium to its NAV.7 Stocks That Will Hit All-Time Highs in 2017Normally, I wouldn't go near something trading with that premium, except that it's about theaverageit has traded at since the financial crisis.Closed-End Funds to Buy: Franklin Limited Duration Income (FTF)Distribution Rate:10.8%Franklin Limited Duration Income Trust of Beneficial Interest(NYSE:FTF) is similar in structure to PHK, but has a few important differences from other closed-end funds that invest in corporate debt. While 43% of the FTF portfolio consists of corporate bonds that offer generous yields, 40% are invested in senior loans.What are senior loans? They are loans that are often secured by a company's assets. They are not considered investment grade and privately issued by various banks and institutional investors in a secondary market. They tend to be illiquid.The difference between senior loans and bonds is that the latter's interest rates are usually fixed whereas senior loan rates tend to float. Another big difference: bond prices will move inversely with interest rates, but senior loan prices do not change when interest rates change. Thus, they act as a hedge against rising short-term rates.FTF has a 10.8% distribution yield.Lawrence Meyers is the CEO of PDL Capital, and manager of the forthcomingLiberty Portfolio stock newsletter.

Report: Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd. and Samsung Facing 10-Nano Yield Issues;3/3/2017;"Contract chip manufacturersTaiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd.(NYSE: TSM) andSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) both recently began mass production of chips   using their respective 10-nanometer chip manufacturing   technologies.Both companies' 10-nanometer technologies allow chipmakers to   build more densely packed (meaning more features) and   higher-performing products, two things that are generally good in   the world of chips.Image source: Intel.makeArticleAd();However, according to a recentreportfrom DigiTimes, both TSMC and Samsung are facing manufacturing   yield issues with their respective 10-nanometer technologies.   Let's go over the implications of those yield challenges.Why are low manufacturing yields bad?Manufacturing yield refers to the percentage of manufactured   chips that both work and meet the performance and power   specifications mandated by the design. It generally costs a fixed   amount of money to manufacture a wafer of chips, so the higher   the yield rate, the greater the number of chips are produced for   a given cost, which means lower effective per-chip cost.Conversely, low yield rates mean higher costs. Such costs can   either be passed on to the customer, the chip manufacturing   company itself could eat the costs, or the responsibility could   be shared.Additionally, chipmakers put in a certain amount of   manufacturing capacity in anticipation of customer demand. If   manufacturing yield rates are too far below plan, then a customer   using the low-yielding technology may not be able to get ahold of   sufficient supply of products.So, low manufacturing yields are generally bad for   business.Specific impacts on TSMC's and Samsung's     customersThe lead customer for TSMC's 10-nanometer technology appears   to be MediaTek, which is using this technology to manufacture its   Helio X30 line of premium smartphone chips. In a statement to   Nikkei Asian Review, a MediaTek executivesaidthat the X30 was ""delayed because the yield rate of 10   [nanometer] process technology [from TSMC] has not yet reached a   satisfactory level... and we are a bit stuck on that.""A silver lining here is that MediaTek doesn't expect   significant adoption of the X30 in premium smartphones (saying   that it expects the X30 to be used in ""less than 10 smartphone   models""), so these yield challenges are unlikely to significantly   disrupt MediaTek's business or the businesses of its   customers.For Samsung and its lead customer, mobile chipmakerQualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM) , the struggle is more significant. The Samsung   Galaxy S8-series devices that are set to be formally announced   later this month are expected to Samsung's Exynos 8895 for some   variants and Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 in other   variants. Both chips are believed to be manufactured by   Samsung using its 10-nanometer LPE technology. DigiTimes   says that Samsung delayed the rollout of the Galaxy S8-series   devices due ""unsatisfactory yield rates.""How about the iPhone?Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is expected to tap TSMC to manufacture the   former's upcoming A11 applications processor on the latter's   10-nanometer technology. The bad news is that the yield   challenges described by DigiTimes could impact Apple's ability to   meet demand for its next-generation iPhones.The good news is that Apple's next iPhone models aren't   expected to launch until the fall, which gives both Apple and   TSMC additional time to work out the kinks on the 10-nanometer   technology.Furthermore, some of the yield issues that MediaTek may be   seeing could be related to its underlying chip design rather than   only due to TSMC's technology. In that case, there's a reasonable   chance that Apple won't face quite the yield problems that   MediaTek is apparently coping with.10 stocks we like better than Taiwan Semiconductor     ManufacturingWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Doing so would retain compatibility with Lightning accessories, but with the advantage of much faster wired charging for the new iPhones.5 Blue-Chip Stocks to Sell in MarchKuo also notes several reasons why AAPL would not choose to implement USB-C instead of staying with its proprietary Lightning port, beyond the potential consumer backlash. The company would be giving up revenue from its MFi program that certifies Lightning accessories. And USB-C ports are physically larger than Lightning - given AAPL's obsession with making iPhones thinner, switching to a larger port seems unlikely.Why Has USB-C Been Such a Flashpoint Issue?The meresuggestionthat AAPL would ditch the Lightning port in favor of USB-C has generated a huge number of articles and editorials and filled Apple forums. Why the fanfare over a simple charging port?There are actually two issues at play here.The first is a sensitivity to Apple eliminating legacy ports. After the company got rid of the decades-old standard 3.5mm jack on the iPhone 7, there were accusations AAPL had done so arbitrarily - maybe to sell more Beats wireless headphones. Even rivalSamsung Electronic(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) hopped on the bandwagon,mocking AAPL's decisionwhen it launched the Galaxy Note 7 - complete with headphone jack.After the Galaxy Note 7's exploding batteries, Samsung may avoid such public taunting in the future. Karma….In the fall, Apple released a new MacBook Pro that had all legacy connectivity ports replaced with USB-C. This infuriated many long-time Mac users because it meant having to buy adapters and dongles for all their current accessories and peripherals. A switch from Lightning to USB-C would be seen by many as another Apple move done more or less arbitrarily, without consideration for the impact it may have on customers.On the other side of the equation, there are also many Apple fans who would love to see the company ditch the proprietary Lightning port for USB-C, which is becoming an industry standard.Snap Inc. (SNAP): Snapchat IPO ALMOST Beats the OddsCount MacBook Pro (and MacBook) owners in that group - they have to purchase a Lightning to USB-C cable if they want to connect an iPhone to their laptop. These people were excited to see theWall Street Journal'spredictionthat AAPL would make the big move.So Where Are We Now on the iPhone 8 Lightning Port?As usual, no one knows for certain what AAPL's plans are. I tend to side with the analysts who are suggesting that Apple isn't about to court controversy with such a critical iPhone release, and will keep the Lightning port but maybe pack in a USB-C cable or adapter this time around.The one thing youcanbet on is that AAPL is watching the conversation and evaluating reaction - if not for the iPhone 8, then for a little further down the line.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace7 Stocks That Will Hit All-Time Highs in 20177 Stocks to Buy That Are ALMOST in Buffett Buying RangeThe postApple Inc.

Nokia Corp (ADR) (NOK) Hopes Old Phone Revival Can Help NOK Stock;3/3/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe high-tech world is still buzzing afterNokia Corp (ADR)(NYSE:NOK) andBlackBerry Ltd(NASDAQ:BBRY) showed off new handsets at last weekend's Mobile World Conference. However, I'm not sure nostalgia for candy bar phones and keyboard PDAs draws the right kind of attention to either company.makeArticleAd();Source:Open Grid Scheduler / Grid Engine via Flickr (Modified)For one, NOK never really left the ""dumb"" end of the phone market behind, so the company's grand ""return"" with a new version of its near-indestructible 3310 handset - popular in 2001 at a price around $120 - is only a shock to people who stopped paying attention, which they did for a reason.Granted, the feature phones that NOK recently pulled back out ofMicrosoft Corporation's(NASDAQ:MSFT) orbit accounted for 9% of the category last year, but that No. 2 share behindSamsung Electronic(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) only added up to 35 million handsets, or at best 2% of the global phone market.A Lesson in Scale for NOK StockSure, it's remotely possible that the return of the 3310 at $50 will somehow dramatically reverse 16 years of technology progress, and be enough to convince a new generation of back-to-basics consumers to trade in their smartphones, I find it unlikely.7 Stocks That Will Hit All-Time Highs in 2017I just don't see that happening here in numbers that even double NOK's market share, and even if it does, an extra 35 million $50 handsets sold close to cost really isn't going to move the needle for NOK stock. Even if the company manages to book half the retail price on each phone as revenue, it's going to take 120 million of them to add 10% to the top line.That's the real lesson of scale here. NOK never went away; it's still a big company, built on the chassis of the old Alcatel and Lucent networking businesses. Now that it has its phones back from MSFT, management needs to deploy them to embrace the future and expand on the role the company wants to play in the Internet of Things (IoT).To me, that means developing phones that don't compete withApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) or Samsung for consumer pocket space, but ones that instead let smart devices communicate with each other. Consider that, in a world of billions of $50 machine-to-machine data relays, the market becomes very interesting for NOK stock investors.It's a similar story for BBRY, which was evolving nicely into an IoT proposition, until now. We may feel nostalgic for the days of a ubiquitous business BlackBerry, but that era was over more than a decade ago. We've since learned to type on virtual keyboards.7 Stocks to Buy That Are ALMOST in Buffett Buying RangeThe question I have about the next generation of BBRY devices revolves around what great things they can do to win consumers away from the iPhones and Androids that already dominate the market. They need to trigger a revolution and not just recapitulate the past.The bottom line is, as interesting as it was to get a blast from the past from these two companies, I just don't see this strategy being a boon for either stock right now.Hilary Kramer is the editor ofGameChangers,Breakout Stocks,High Octane Trader,Absolute Capital ReturnandValue Authority.

Will Procter & Gamble (PG) Stock Get Its Activist Spark?;3/3/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThink you know what to expect to see next fromProcter & Gamble Co(NYSE:PG) now that activist investor Nelson Peltz has his hands on roughly $3.5 billion worth of PG stock?makeArticleAd();Source:Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified)If you're expecting some pressure on P&G's management to split the company up as a way of unlocking shareholder value (which is the consensus) you're probably right.'That being said, such a development isn't a foregone conclusion. Peltz, the chief of investment management outfit Trian Partners, has just as much of a history of focusing on solving execution problems - and even spurring acquisitions - as he does splitting up companies.The question is, what does Procter & Gamble need most?PG Stock Is an Easy Activist TargetThe purchase washinted at in December, though unnamed at the time. In the meantime it's been confirmed Peltz was talking about what would eventually be 6.4 million shares of PG stock.The general consensus is that Peltz intends to start improving the company's profitability from the inside, cutting costs and overhauling operations. More than just a few observers, however, suspect that is only a precursor to breaking the company up into more focused parts.And it's not as if the company couldn't use the help.10 Dangerous Dividend Stocks to Dump NowThe consumer products name behind brands such as Pampers diapers, Ivory soap and Downy detergent was once a competitor nobody wanted to face, and an investment everybody wanted to own. Time, size, and complexity have taken a toll on P&G.Revenue has been dwindling for a couple of years now, and while income has held steady, investors had good reason to expect growth.To its credit, Procter & Gamble has been streamlining itself, recently selling a wide swath of its beauty brands toCoty Inc(NYSE:COTY) -$11.3 billion worth of beauty brands, to be precise. After alittle more than a year on the job though, CEO David Taylor was expected by shareholders to show actual proof of life, rather than just shrinking the company towards success. Its brand names - and the Procter & Gamble name itself - are too valuable to let languish.Enter Nelson PeltzTo figure out how the activist investor intends to handle a new project, one only has to look at his previous activist efforts. Unfortunately, Peltz has widely varied repertoire.Take Peltz's interest in Heinz, for instance. Back in 2006 -well before it merged with Kraftto becomeKraft Heinz Co(NASDAQ:KHC) - Peltz took an interest and a controlling position in the venerable pickle and ketchup manufacturer, partly to encourage the spinoff of weaker, distracting divisions, but mostly tocut costs the company's management seemed unwilling or unable to make. It was that newly created value that got Warren Buffett'sBerkshire Hathaway Inc.(NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B) and 3G Capitalinterested in buying Heinz in 2013, ultimately setting up the pairing with Kraft.However, Peltz's $2.5 billion stake inGeneral Electric Company(NYSE:GE), taken in 2015, wasalmost an entirely passive one. CEO Jeff Immelt was already streamlining the company and Peltz felt the market was undervaluing where GE was going. Peltz was just along for the ride, mostly leaving the company alone.Still, Trian Capital's reputation as an activist stakeholder is well-deserved, as Peltz has in the past prioritized divestitures and acquisitions that management teams haven't wanted.Case in point: In 2013, Peltz was pushingPepsiCo, Inc.(NYSE:PEP) to acquire snack foods makerMondelez International Inc(NASDAQ:MDLZ), an outcome that surprisingly didn't materialize, considering he was amajor shareholder in both companies. Once Peltz gave up on the idea of the marriage, he began to push for the spinoff of PepsiCo's snack food division. It would have been a very close ""next best thing"" to a union of Mondelez and PepsiCo.Cost cuts were also always part of the discussions between Peltz and PepsiCo, but never really the priority.Bottom Line for PG StockThe question is: which of those three previous situations does Procter & Gamble most resemble now? Is the consumer staples giant too big and too disparate for its own good and would be better off splitting itself up, or is the organization just bloated, with too many overlapping parts, each incurring unnecessary expenses?Most long-term owners of PG stock likely see the organization's challenges aren't rooted in too much diversity, but rather, in years of sloppy integration of a variety of business lines. Indeed, with the bulk of its brands all readily available in grocery stores, the opportunities for synergies as well as cross-marketing are terrific; marketing is largely the same sort of shtick for each of its product lines.Costco Wholesale Corporation (COST) Stock: The Danger Is GrowingAt the same time, there's little assurance that any divestiture would command an attractive price in the open market even if P&G and Peltz did want to spin off some units.That's arguably okay with Peltz, who ismore of an operational activistthan one who simply ""unlocks value"" by breaking companies apart. In other words, he's playing the long game here and that's a good thing for loyal shareholders. Current and prospective owners of PG stock have been waiting too long for this ride to get underway.Of course, if that effort doesn't get traction, Peltz isn't afraid to press for spinoffs, either.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceTrade Bank of America Corp (BAC) Stock for No-Cost ProfitsQualcomm, Inc.

Qualcomm, Inc. (QCOM) Stock Has Problems Beyond Apple Inc. (AAPL);3/3/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe narrative surroundingQualcomm, Inc.(NASDAQ:QCOM) stock changed in late January, whenApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) sued the chip maker for $1 billion. Qualcomm's high-margin fabless model had been a big part of the bull case for QCOM stock. Suddenly, that royalty-based model looked more like that of a ""patent troll"" than a desirable licensing stream. QCOM stock fell 13% on the news, and has regained only a portion of those losses.makeArticleAd();Source:Karlis Dambrans via FlickrWhile the AAPL lawsuit has been the headline news, there are other concerns for Qualcomm shareholders. Competition, regulatory pressure and earnings all present risks at the moment. It's not as if QCOM stock is pricing in incredible growth, with the stock trading at about 12x 2017 analyst consensus EPS. But Qualcomm may not be pricing in all those risks, either.AAPL and QCOM StockWhat's notable about the change in sentiment toward QCOM stock is that the recent concerns, on their own, shouldn't bethatbig a deal. The Apple lawsuit is no exception. AAPL is asking for $1 billion in damages, which isn't a lot of money for Qualcomm. QCOM stock has a market cap of $82 billion; a $1 billion payment would represent about 1.2% of its value, or about less than 70 cents per share.Meanwhile, Qualcomm ended its first quarter (ending Dec. 25) with over $10 billion in cash and marketable securities on its balance sheet. QCOM quite literally could simply write a check for the $1 billion in damages - even if it loses or settles with Apple.But the concern is that the Apple lawsuit is just the tip of the iceberg, so to speak. Apple's contention is that Qualcomm's pricing itself is unfair. QCOM - per Apple's interpretation - charges royalties based on the value of the entire device, not just the technology being licensed.On AAPL's Q1 earnings call, CEO Tim Cook said the strategy was ""somewhat like buying a sofa, and you charge somebody a different price depending upon the price of the house that it goes into.""5 Blue-Chip Stocks to Sell in MarchQualcomm naturally has defended its strategy, and it's too early to tell on whose side U.S. courts will fall. But the questions raised by the Apple lawsuit have implications that go beyond a single court case.QCOM Stock and Licensing RevenueThe core problem for QCOM stock is that Apple isn't alone in questioning its model. Qualcomm has been hit with an $800 million-plus fine in South Korea for alleged antitrust violations under a similar theory to that being pushed by AAPL. (That fine is under appeal.) Qualcomm already paid nearly a billion dollars to settle an investigation in China. And a week before the Apple lawsuit, the U.S. FTC announced its own investigation.The issue isn't just fines and lawsuits, or a billion dollars here and another billion there. The licensing model is the foundation of Qualcomm's business. Per the company's 10-K, the licensing segment generated $6.5 billion in pre-tax earnings. The rest of the company created $2.2 billion in profit - barely one-third of the licensing business's total.If QCOM's royalty rate has to come down, or the base on which those royalties is charged moves from the value of the product to the value of the part, Qualcomm's profit margins and revenue can come down substantially. Potential changes in the licensing model are a legitimate risk to QCOM stock. And it's not the only risk out there.QCOM Stock Has Other Concerns, TooEven if the licensing model stays largely intact, Qualcomm's sales and earnings have other sources of pressure. Overall market growth for smartphones, in particular, is stalling out. That's one reason why AAPL stock - even at all-time highs - still has a relatively modest earnings multiple.In response, Qualcomm is acquiringNXP Semiconductors NV(NASDAQ:NXPI), which will move the company into automotive and IoT (Internet of Things). But that acquisition also moves Qualcomm into a more traditional manufacturing model - and won't close until the end of this year, per company guidance. Benefits from the merger will take some time to accrue, and Qualcomm could see integration disruption in 2018.Snap Inc. (SNAP): Snapchat IPO ALMOST Beats the OddsFinally, there's competition.Intel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) has partially displaced QCOM in some iPhone models, and could take more slots if the legal battle takes time to play out. In automotive, NXP will take onNvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA) andMobileye NV(NYSE:MBLY). That's a lot of giants taking on a tight market - one reason why NVDA stock has slumped more than 16% over the past few weeks.Is there enough to short QCOM? Probably not - not unless an investor is willing to aggressively bet on Apple's interpretation of Qualcomm's business model. But there's enough here to justify the recent slump in QCOM stock, and an earnings multiple that looks simply too low. And the problem for Qualcomm is that while the Apple lawsuit is the most covered story, it's not theonlystory that can hurt QCOM stock.As of this writing, Vince Martin had no position in any securities mentioned.More From InvestorPlace10 Dangerous Dividend Stocks to Dump Now7 Stocks to Buy That Are ALMOST in Buffett Buying RangeThe postQualcomm, Inc.

Bad News for Apple Inc.'s OLED iPhone;3/3/2017;"Later this year,Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is expected to introduce three new iPhones. The   first two will be typical refreshes of its iPhone 7 and iPhone 7   Plus models, respectively, while the third is expected to be an   ultra-premium model with a curved OLED display and other features   that'll make it a technical tour-de-force.The general expectation is that the company plans to release   all three models this fall. However, a new report from DigiTimes,   citing ""industry sources,"" suggests that the company might not be   able to launch -- or, at the very least, begin shipping -- the   OLED iPhone until after the standard models launch.Image source: Apple.makeArticleAd();A redesigned fingerprint scanner driving a     delayPer the report, which cites ""industry sources,"" Apple has   ""decided to use its own Authentec algorithm combined with   Privaris glass identification to redesign a new fingerprint ID   solution.""What's interesting is that Apple purchased nearly the entirety   of Privaris' patent portfolio between December 2012 and October   2014, per CNN. Furthermore, MacRumors reported back in 2015 that   Privaris had ""essentially shut down"" about five years prior to   the publication of the report.""This certainly appears to be a patent portfolio purchase   rather than a full acquisition of Privaris by Apple,"" MacRumors'   Joe Rossignol wrote at the time.Based on DigiTimes' report and the information from CNN and   MacRumors, it really looks like this new fingerprint   identification solution is a home-grown effort by Apple,   potentially years in the making.Due to Apple needing to redesign its fingerprint scanning   technology for the OLED iPhone, DigiTimes' sources say that the   iDevice maker's OLED iPhone might not go into production until   September (the other two models, DigiTimes says, will go into   production in July).What does this mean for Apple and the OLED     iPhone?It takes some time to go from volume production to devices in   customers' hands. For example, DigiTimes says that the iPhone   7s/7s Plus will go into production in July, so we're looking at   about a two-month lag between when mass production starts and   when customers can get their new phones.So, if DigiTimes is right, customers might not be able to get   ahold of the new OLED iPhone until November.Now, there are two courses of action that come to mind here.   The first is that Apple can simply announce the new OLED iPhone   alongside the other models in the fall, begin to take pre-orders   for the OLED model, and then just ship them out as soon as   practicable.Apple could also hold two separate launch events; the first   for the refreshed versions of the current iPhones, with the   launch of the more expensive OLED iPhone just a few months   later.Personally, I think that the first course of action is more   likely for a couple of reasons:If Apple doesn't launch the hotly anticipated OLED iPhone     in the fall, customers who really want phones with curved OLED     displays might just give up on Apple and choose devices from     competitors (even if they would have preferred an Apple phone     all else equal).The OLED iPhone is likely to be significantly more     expensive than the regular models. Apple really shouldn't risk     potentially driving a ""mix down"" in iPhone sales by having some     customers opt for the cheaper iPhone 7s/7s Plus for lack of     another option when they would have been willing to pay more     for the more expensive OLED iPhone (if it were     announced/available for pre-order).Of course, Apple is better off delaying a product a smidgen to   make sure it's ready to go and if the redesigned fingerprint   scanner meaningfully enhances the user experience, then the delay   is probably worth it.But, if it's true, it'll be a bummer for some Apple customers   and could potentially push out when Apple begins to enjoy the   financial benefits of the next-generation iPhone cycle.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Amazon to Install Solar Panels to Power Datacenters;3/3/2017;"The world is fast shifting to alternative energy and this is spurring demand for solar panels.E-commerce giantAmazon.com Inc.AMZNis gearing up for its next project associated with renewable energy initiatives. This time, the firm will harness solar energy by installing solar panels on the roof of its fulfillment facilities across the world.Coming to the price performance, over the past one year, shares of Amazon outperformed the Zacks categorized Electronic Commerce industry. While the industry gained 39.53%, the stock returned 45.91%.DetailsAs part of its commitment to advance green power, Amazon has plans of deploying large-scale solar systems on rooftops of more than 15 fulfillment and sortation centers in the U.S. this year. By 2020, around 50 data centers are expected to use solar energy to meet their power needs.Amazon said that these solar panels could generate up to 80% of the annual energy requirements of a fulfillment center depending on the project, time of year and other factors. The company already has a network of wind and solar farms in Indiana, North Carolina, Ohio and Virginia. Its largest wind farm is in Texas.Amazon's senior vice president of Worldwide Operations, Dave Clark, said ""As our fulfillment network continues to expand, we want to help generate more renewable energy at both existing and new facilities around the world in partnership with community and business leaders.""Focus on Carbon NeutralityThis initiative by Amazon is the latest in a string of clean energy investments made by U.S. technology giants in recent months. For quite some time, Amazon has been moving away from fossil fuels and focusing more on clean energy. It aims at reducing its carbon footprint and using more renewable energy to power its huge data centers. Moreover, the company can generate healthy returns from these solar and wind investments as there are many associated tax incentives.Infact many corporate behemoths including GoogleGOOGL, FacebookFBand AppleAAPLare progressively moving toward alternative energy sources to lower their overall carbon emissions and cut their energy bills substantially.Also, several countries are increasingly relying on solar power to generate clean energy. Stringent environmental legislations on greenhouse gas emissions have also proved to be a boon for the solar power sector. Moreover, despite high initial investments, low operational costs and no fuel costs make these solar investments attractive.Amazon.com, Inc. Price and ConsensusAmazon.com, Inc.

How Many Shares of Apple Does Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Own?;3/3/2017;"You've probably seen the headlines. Famed billionaire investor   Warren Buffett has been loading up onApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) stock. But just how many shares has he bought   throughBerkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK-B) (NYSE: BRK-A) ?Millions of shares and billions of dollarsA glance at Berkshire's most recent SEC filing with updates on   the company's common stock investments reveals Apple has become   one of Berkshire's largest positions, valued at over $7 billion.   But Buffett didn't stop at the 61.2 million Apple shares reported   in the annual 10-K filing. The Berkshire chairman and   CEO has since more than doubled his position in Apple,   growing Berkshire's slice of the tech giant to a whopping 133   million shares, Buffett said in a CNBC interview this week.   This puts Berkshire's stake in the $729 billion company at about   2.5%.Image source: Apple.makeArticleAd();There's no doubt this investment in Apple is an important   wager for Berkshire. WithApple stocktrading at about $139 at the time of this writing, that's an   $18.5 billion position, second only to Berkshire's $29 billion   position inWells Fargoand edging out Berkshire's $17 billion position inCoca-Cola. Berkshire's fourth, fifth, and sixth biggest holdings areIBM,American Express, andPhillips 66,valued at about $13 billion, $11 billion, and $6 billion,   respectively.Still a fraction of Berkshire's whole businessDespite being Berkshire's second-largest holding now,   investors shouldn't expect Berkshire's performance to be heavily   influenced by Apple stock. Berkshire is a large company in its   own right, with a market capitalization of $432 billion. Further,   Berkshire's results remain more closely tied to its wholly owned   subsidiaries than its equities portfolio.First in importance at Berkshire is its wholly owned insurance   businesses, which include giants Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance   Group, General Re, GEICO, and more. Together, Berkshire's   insurance businesses ended 2016 with $91.5 billion of float, or   premiums collected upfront that can be invested, and generated a   combined underwriting profit of $2.1 billion.Then there's Berkshire's regulated, capital-intensive   business, which includes BNSF railroad and Berkshire Hathaway   Energy (Berkshire's 90%-owned utility business). These two   companies alone accounted for 33% of Berkshire's after-tax   operating profits in 2016.Berkshire agreed to acquire BNSF in 2009 in a deal that     valued the railway company at $34 billion. Image source:     BNSF.And Berkshire's subsidiaries don't stop here. Berkshire's   manufacturing, service, and retailing operations ""sell products   ranging from lollipops to jet airplanes,"" Buffett said in his   2016 annual letter to shareholders. This ""motley crew,"" as   Buffett calls it, generated $5.6 billion in operating profits for   Berkshire. Or, as explained in Berkshire's 10-K filing, their   combined results can be summed up like this:Viewed as a single entity, the companies in the     manufacturing, service and retailing group are an excellent     business. They employed an average of $24 billion of net     tangible assets during 2016 and, despite their holding large     quantities of excess cash and carrying very little debt, earned     24% after-tax on that capital.Finally, Berkshire's finance and financial products businesses   generated a nice $2.1 billion of net income for Berkshire in   2016.So, yes, Buffett's bet on Apple is massive next to Berkshire's   other common stock investments. And the massive position is   certainly a signal of Buffett's great confidence in the tech   giant's long-term potential. But both Apple and Berkshire   investors should keep in mind that Berkshire is still far more   than an $18.5 billion bet on Apple.10 stocks we like better than Berkshire     HathawayWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Apple Inc. (AAPL) Posts Best Q4 Apple Watch Sales Ever;3/3/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAs last year's holiday sales were ramping up,Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) faced claims that its Apple Watch was in trouble. Smartwatch sales were down - with AAPL doing worse than most - and some analysts were calling for a miserable Q4. Apple CEO Tim Cook even took the unusual measure of speaking to the press to claim Apple Watch sales were actually off the charts.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');Source: AppleHowever, IDC just released its numbers for Q4 wearables, and it looks like Apple was right. It booked its best Apple Watch Q4 numbers to date.Fitbit Inc(NYSE:FIT), on the other hand, didn't do so well.The IDC Numbers on Q4 2016 Wearables SalesIDC just released itsnumbers for Q4 2016 wearables sales. This covers both fitness trackers and smartwatches. Overall sales were up 16.9% year-over-year with 102.4 million wearable devices being shipped during the quarter, worldwide.The firm noted a continuing trend toward smartwatch makers adopting an activity tracking approach, while traditional fitness tracker makers - like Fitbit - scrambled to add features, becoming multi-use devices.Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Is Moving Markets - LiterallyThe results for the quarter show that Apple's strategy of making its second generation smartwatch even more fitness focused paid off, with record Apple Watch sales.IDC had this to say:""AppleWatch Series 1 and Series 2 proved to be a magnificent success for the company as it was the company's best quarter ever in the wearables market. The lower entry price point and the inclusion of GPS on the Series 2 along with a completely revamped user interface have helped the company grow its presence. Apple is one of the few companies that has been able to quickly refocus its watch to gain traction in the consumer market and has also been leading the charge on introducing the smartwatch category to the commercial segment.""Fitbit, on the other hand, had a miserable quarter. Its smart wearables like the Blaze weren't enough to fend off the Apple Watch.The U.S. market (where its marketing is focused) is approaching saturation for basic fitness trackers. China'sXiaomicranked out cheap fitness trackers and added new more upscale models with features like heart rate tracking.As a result, for Q4 Apple Watch sales were up 13% (to 4.6 million units for the quarter) and Xiaomi was up 96.2% (5.2 million units). Fitbit maintained its first-place position, but sold just 6.5 million units, a 22.7% drop compared to last year.Q4 Smartwatch Sales Show AAPL's Fitness Focus Paying OffThe IDC numbers vindicate Apple CEO Tim Cook's comments in December. Speaking in response to a a report (from IDC, ironically) that suggested the smartwatch category was in trouble and the Apple Watch would face ""muted"" success,Cook responded:""Our data shows that Apple Watch is doing great and looks to be one of the most popular holiday gifts this year. Sales growth is off the charts. In fact, during the first week of holiday shopping, our sell-through of Apple Watch was greater than any week in the product's history. And as we expected, we're on track for the best quarter ever for Apple Watch.""That comment was looked at with some suspicion at the time. It seemed a little defensive and vague.Is the Reversal in Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock a Buying Opportunity?The Apple Watch series 2, launched in September, featured a renewed focus on fitness and activity, including a built-in GPS that freed it from the smartwatch for running. A partnership withNike Inc(NYSE:NKE) resulted in theApple Watch Nike+aimed offered sports enthusiasts.At the same time, Apple tweaked the performance of the Apple Watch and has continually improved its watchOS operating system.With record Q4 Apple Watch sales that exceeded the numbers from its launch year -when excitement about the all new smartwatch was running high- AAPL's strategy is clearly paying off. And contrary to that earlier IDC report from last year, the Apple Watch is enjoying better than ""muted"" success.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceApple Inc.

Buying Snap Today Could Be Like Buying Apple 35 Years Ago;3/3/2017;"Snapchat (Shutterstock photo)Many on Wall Street are comparing Snap Inc. (SNAP) to Facebook (FB) or Twitter (TWTR) and for now, that's okay. All three can be considered social networks, rely on daily active users and generate the majority of their revenue from advertising.In the future, however, Snap may wind up being more like another Silicon Valley giant than the aforementioned ones -- Apple (AAPL).makeArticleAd();Buying stock in Snap today is a bet on CEO Evan Spiegel more than it is on the company's prowess as an advertising behemoth. Spiegel, 26, is a product visionary the world has not seen seen Apple's Steve Jobs and to some extent, Tesla Inc. (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk.There are similarities between Jobs and Spiegel, both starting their companies after dropping out of college, are wonderful salesmen and marketers, but the similarities go further than that.Jobs is Spiegel's idol; he has a portrait of the legendary Apple co-founder hanging in his office. When unveiling Spectacles toThe Wall Street Journalthis past fall, he even used Jobs-ian language, saying ""You wanna see it?"" as he took off the towel covering the product. This mentality plays to the culture of secrecy at both companies, not releasing products until they are ready to be talked about.And unlike other technology companies, neither Snap or Apple have ""beta"" products. There is no group of early adopters buying and using a product so the companies can get an idea of how users are interacting with it and then continue to refine. Every meticulous detail is thought out and obsessed over and is not released until it's perfect.Aegis Capital analyst Victor Anthony said the company's most valuable asset is its demographic, with 13-24 year olds comprising nearly 60% of its user base. While these are highly coveted by advertisers such as Procter & Gamble, Clorox and others, Spiegel is the company's most valuable asset. The ability to know what people want before they want or see it is an invaluable trait that very few executives have. It can not be measured or valued, but it's something that investors need to keenly aware of when looking at where to put their investing dollars.Snap has positioned and sold itself as a camera company, having mentioned that multiple times in its S-1. This can allow them to expand into everything and anything that has a camera.Despite the optimism surrounding Spiegel, the stickiness of Snapchat (engagement levels are shockingly high) and the coveted user base, it's not all roses for Snap at this stage.There are concerns about the company's financial picture, as it still generates the majority of its revenue from advertising. Going up against Facebook and Google, which have mountains of user data that advertisers love, can be a daunting task (just ask Twitter).Issues surrounding slowing user growth, the ability for competitors to copy product features, lack of data analytics, no voting control with Class A shares are all valid reasons to be wary of Snap, especially at a $35 billion valuation.But again, it comes down to be at the forefront of an area that's only going to expand with a product visionary for a CEO.Images, whether it's augmented reality, virtual reality, moving or static, are humanity's future. All you have to do is just look at the popularity of Instagram to see why. Snap, with Snapchat, its burgeoning hardware portfolio and most importantly Spiegel, is poised to be at the forefront of this trend for many years to come."

Don't Miss the Red Flags at Qorvo;3/3/2017;"In the third quarter, just over a third ofQorvo's(NASDAQ: QRVO) revenue came from its largest customer. Though   Qorvo didn't name this customer explicitly, it is widely   believedthe company's biggest account isApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) , to which it supplies radio frequency chips to   enhance signals. This would make Qorvo one of the more   diversified Apple suppliers, especially compared toSkyworks Solutions(NASDAQ: SWKS) andCirrus Logic(NASDAQ: CRUS) , which are reportedly dependent on Apple for 40%   and 85% of their revenues, respectively.In that light, Qorvo seems like a diversified bet. What's   more, Qorvo's second-largest customer, with 11% of revenue, is   the fast-growing Chinese smartphone playerHuawei. Additionally, it countsSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) among its client list.All this diversification, however, couldn't save Qorvo from   setting weak guidance for the fourth quarter. Qorvo expects its   fourth-quarter revenue to be $630 million at the midpoint of its   guidance range. This is much lower than the consensus revenue   estimate of $719 million, and if Qorvo manages to hit the   midpoint of its guidance, its revenue will increase just 3.6%   from the prior-year period.makeArticleAd();Let's take a look at what's going on with the company and why   investors should take note.Image source: Qorvo.The problems at QorvoQorvo's key smartphone clients are under pressure, and this is   reflected in the company's guidance. CFO Mark Murphy had the   following to say about the company's weak outlook during the Feb.   1 conference call (transcript viaSeeking Alpha), ""This guidance primarily reflects a greater than historical   sequential decline in the March quarter, as two of our leading   customers in China and a tier 1 customer in Korea delayed   flagship smartphone launches.""The delayed smartphone launch by Qorvo's Korean customer seems   to be a reference to Samsung, since the Galaxy S8 won't be   launched at the Mobile World Congress happening this week, as the   S7 was last year. Samsung is reportedly going to launch its   flagship in April instead, as it carries out intensive testing of   the device to avoid a Note7-like fiasco. There's no doubt that   this delay has pushed back Qorvo's potential revenue from Samsung   by at least a quarter and led to a weak outlook.Meanwhile, Apple is believed to be slashing its iPhone   production by roughly 10% in the current quarter, after producing   more units than it sold during the holiday period. Supply chain   data suggests that Apple placed orders to manufacture 89 million   iPhone units in the December-ended quarter, while it sold only   78.3 million. This leaves Apple with a surplus of around 10   million iPhones for the current quarter, so it has reportedly   decided to scale back production.In fact, Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities is of the opinion that   iPhone production will decline throughout the first half of 2017,   until the production cycle of the next model kicks in. So, it   looks like Qorvo will not get any bump in its revenue from its   largest customer in the first half of 2017. But is there more   afoot here than just declining smartphone orders?Is Skyworks eating Qorvo's lunch?Qorvo is a direct competitor of Skyworks Solutions, as both   companies make radio-frequency components for the same customers.   However,Skyworks provided a strong outlookfor the current quarter when it released results in January. Its   revenue expectation of $840 million means that its top line could   grow 8% from the prior-year period and exceed consensus analyst   estimates of $818 million, while Qorvo's revenue is expected to   increase just 3.6%.As Skyworks' outlook is rosier than Qorvo's, the former could   be winning market share. Mike Walkley of Canaccord Genuity (viaBarron's) has a similar opinion, writing:We also believe Skyworks is increasing content with Samsung     and is well positioned for content growth with new Samsung     products ramping in the upcoming quarters. We believe other     Chinese OEMs will follow Huawei's leadership with increased RF     content.Additionally, Skyworks CEO Liam Griffin said that his company   has seen content wins in ""multiple devices across Samsung's   entire portfolio, and gained momentum in China, with key wins at   market leaders Oppo, Vivo, Meizu, and Xiaomi."" The comments made   by Skyworks after its latest results indicate that it is winning   a lot of content in the same areas where Qorvo is not feeling   confident.In fact, Huawei has now become Skyworks' second-largest   customer after Skyworks won almost all of the RF chip spots in   Huawei's P9 flagship smartphones last year. On the other hand,   Skyworks had reportedly won three spots in the iPhone 7, while   Qorvo supplied two chips. In comparison, both companies had two   chips each inside the iPhone 6s, according to a teardown of the   device by Chipworks.The competition from Skyworks is a red flag that Qorvo   investors should not ignore.10 stocks we like better than QorvoWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Why Is Apple (AAPL) Up 8.6% Since the Last Earnings Report?;3/3/2017;"A month has gone by since the last earnings report forApple Inc.AAPL. Shares have added about 8.6% in that time frame, outperforming the market.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Apple Q1 Earnings and Revenues Beat, Increase   Y/YApple reported better-than-expected first quarter of fiscal 2017 results. Earnings of $3.36 per share and revenues of $78.4 billion easily topped the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.22 and $76.9 billion. On a year-over-year basis, both metrics registered growth of 2.4% and 3.3%.Product DetailsThe good show was driven by impressive sales of Apple's latest smartphone model iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. The performance of Apple's Services business was also impressive.Total iPhone unit sales came in at about 78.3 million, up 5% year over year. Revenues from iPhone also grew 5% from the year-ago quarter to $54.4 billion (69.4% of total revenue).Services, which include revenues from Internet Services, App store, Apple Music, AppleCare, Apple Pay, licensing and other services, surged 18% year over year (with extra one week in the quarter) to nearly $7.2 billion. App Store sales in December alone topped $3 billion. Apple said that it expects Services ""revenues to be the size of a Fortune 100 company this year.""Management also noted that Apple Pay reported transaction volume growth of 500%, buoyed by expansion to markets like Spain, Japan, Russia and New Zealand. At present Apple Pay is available in 13 markets.Apple Mac unit sales were up 1% year over year to approximately 5.4 million, while revenues grew 7% from the prior-year quarter to $7.2 billion.Coming to iPad, Apple sold 13.1 million units in the quarter, down 19% year over year. Revenues of $5.5 billion were down 22% from the prior year quarter.Other products, which include revenues from Apple TV, Apple Watch, Beats products, iPod and Apple-branded and third-party accessories, declined 8% year over year to over $4 billion. Again, there were no data available on Apple Watch sales or its latest product launch, AirPods.Geographical PerformanceDemand for Apple's products improved across most of the geographical regions except greater China. As much as 64% of sales were from the International markets.Americas (the biggest market for Apple) generated revenues of approximately $32 billion in the quarter, up 9% year over year.Europe generated nearly $18.5 billion in revenues, up 3% on a year-over-year basis.Revenues from Japan rose 20% year over year to $5.8 billion while the rest of Asia Pacific generated revenues of $5.8 billion, up 8% year over year.Owing to persistent macroeconomic weakness, Apple revenues declined around 12% year over year in the Greater China region to $16.2 billion.MarginsGross margin was 38.5%, a decline of 160 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter.Operating expenses increased 9% year over year to $6.8 billion due to higher research & development expenses as well as selling, general and administrative expenses. As a result, operating margin plunged 210 bps from the year-ago quarter to 29.8%.Balance Sheet and Cash FlowApple's cash and cash equivalents (and short-term marketable securities) were $60.5 billion at the end of the quarter, compared with $67.2 billion at fiscal 2016-end. Long-term debt was $73.6 billion compared with $75.4 billion at the end of fiscal 2016.For the quarter, cash generated from operating activities was $27.1 billion.Apple returned about $15 billion in capital returns this quarter through dividends and share repurchases. Apple also said that it has so far returned $201 billion out of the $250 billion capital returns program announced in April last year.The company also declared its quarterly dividend of $0.57 per share payable on Feb 16 to shareholders of record as on Feb 13.GuidanceFor the second quarter of fiscal 2017, Apple forecasts revenues in a range of $51.5 billion to $53.5 billion.Gross margin is expected within 38% to 39%, while operating expenses are projected within $6.5 billion to $6.6 billion. Other income/ (expense) is likely to be $400 million, while tax rate is expected to be 26%.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?Following the release, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates.

More Bad News for Apple Watch;3/2/2017;"The performance ofApple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) first smartwatch remains an open question,   considering the fact that the company remains insistent on not   disclosing Apple Watch's financial results with investors. CEO   Tim Cook has long maintained that the decision around reporting ""says nothing about our expectations,"" instead citing competitive reasons. Lacking official figures,   investors have little choice but to rely on third-party   estimates, for better or for worse.Market researcher IDC has just put out its preliminary   estimates on the wearables market for 2016, and there's a   particularly troublesome data point for Apple.Apple Watch Series 2. Image source: Apple.makeArticleAd();Unit volumes declined (already)For the full year, Apple shipped an estimated 10.7 million   Apple Watches, which was down nearly 8% from the estimated 11.6   million units that the company shipped in 2015. Here are the top   five vendors:Vendor2015 Unit Shipments2016 Unit ShipmentsChange (YOY)Fitbit22 million22.5 million2.4%Xiaomi12 million15.7 million31%Apple11.6 million10.7 million(7.9%)Garmin5.8 million6.1 million5.4%Samsung3.2 million4.4 million38.6%Data source: IDC. YOY = year over year.It gets worse. The important context missing here is that   Apple launched Apple Watch in April 2015, and wasn't able to   meaningfully ramp production until June 2016. So the estimated   11.6 million Apple Watches that the company shipped in 2015 only   cover two to three quarters out of the year, while the 10.7   million units for 2016 represent both a full year of availabilityandthe second-generation update to Apple Watch Series 2.There are a few ways you could attempt to justify the   year-over-year decline. Perhaps the early adopter wave in 2015   was simply so strong due to years of rumors of a forthcoming   Apple wearable feeding pent-up demand that it created a tough   comparison for 2016. Maybe the expectations of a   second-generation model dampened sales for Series 1.Silver liningsThere are a couple silver linings, chief among them being that   Apple sold a record 4.6 million Apple Watches in the fourth   quarter, up 13% from Q4 2015. That shows that Apple indeed   enjoyed a busy holiday shopping season, and that the Series 2   updates were fairly compelling. Apple previously said that Apple   Watch units and revenue were both atrecord levelslast quarter.It's also encouraging that the broader wearables market is   still growing, up 25% to 102 million units for the year. Even if   within the wearables market smartwatches are stumbling, the   overarching secular trend of wearable technology remains intact.   Apple is intent on being at the forefront of wearables (and even   considers certain headphone products like AirPods as wearables   for some strange reason), and as long as Apple continues to   invest in an expanding portfolio of wearable products, it will   shape the way.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

It is not immediately obvious how popular the stock is because Alphabet trades an A and a C share class, which are treated as seperate companies by lists put together through automation. They are economically equivalent, however, and if you add them up, Alphabet is one of the highest-owned stocks among the great investors tracked by GuruFocus.Back in 2009,Warren Buffett(Trades,Portfolio) talked aboutIBM(IBM), Apple and Google:makeArticleAd();""The chances of being way wrong in IBM are probably less, at least for us, than the chances of being way wrong in Google or Apple. I just don't know how to value them.I would not be at all surprised to see them be worth a lot more money 10 years from now but I would not buy either one of them. I sure as hell wouldn't short them either.""In addition,Charlie Munger(Trades, Portfolio) said:""Google has a huge new moat. In fact, I've probably never seen such a wide moat.""Munger added it was also filled with sharks. It is impossible to assess a moat without understanding competitors and their chances to successfully assault a company's market share. In this case, Munger might have seen the potential early while Buffett remained unconvinced. Buffett has alluded to his biggest mistakes as acts of omission.Bill Gates, formerMicrosoft(MSFT) chairman and a good friend of Buffett, stepped down in 2014. Microsoft runs the only real competition to Google search. Gates stepping down may have freed Buffett to learn about that competitive landscape from him.In additon, Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin and Chairman Eric Schmidt traveled to Omaha to talk to Buffett when setting up the new Alphabet structure, which is molded after Berkshire.Shortly before the trip, they brought in CFO Ruth Porat, who understands the tech founders' goals for the company.Buffett included the following paragraphs in the 2017 shareholder letter, putting my spider senses on red alert:""In 2002, entrepreneur Mitch Kapor asserted that 'By 2029 no computer - or 'machine intelligence' - will have passed the Turing Test,' which deals with whether a computer can successfully impersonate a human being. Inventor Ray Kurzweil took the opposing view. Each backed up his opinion with $10,000. I don't know who will win this bet, but I will confidently wager that no computer will ever replicate Charlie.That same year, Craig Mundie of Microsoft asserted that pilotless planes would routinely fly passengers by 2030, while Eric Schmidt of Google argued otherwise. The stakes were $1,000 each. To ease any heartburn Eric might be experiencing from his outsized exposure, I recently offered to take a piece of his action. He promptly laid off $500 with me. (I like his assumption that I'll be around in 2030 to contribute my payment, should we lose.)""This paragraph shows Buffett has been studying the tech world very hard and is open to the possibility the Turing test will be cracked by 2029. He also must have looked into the dynamics of driverless or pilotless technology, note the recent investment into airlines, to take on a $500 bet. I do not think betting against Buffett is generally a profitable endeavour. What jumped out at me is, apparently, Alphabet's chairman and Buffett recently spoke again. They must have spoken for quite some time for the subject of this casual bet to come up.All these factors have led me to speculate on the potential of an Alphabet investment.The pieces are falling into place.Buffett has been studying tech intensely.Berkshire has made a 180 as far as tech investments go.Buffett and Munger view Alphabet as having an incredibly strong moat.Alphabet's valuation is at an attractive level given the interest from the value investing greats. Porat is a great addition to the executive suite ,covering up pre-existing weaknesses in the team.Google executives have met with Buffett on multiple occasions and Schmidt talked to him recently.The one thing I could see keeping Buffett from making an investment is his distaste for stock-based compensation. Alphabet continues to dole it out like it is candy on Halloween.I would go as far as to say it would greatly surprise me if we do not see Berkshire buying a stake in Alphabet in the next five years.Disclosure: Author owns none of these stocks.Start afree 7-day trial of Premium Membershipto GuruFocus.Premium MembersThis article first appeared onGuruFocus."

What Does Warren Buffett See in Apple?;3/2/2017;"SinceWarren Buffett(Trades,Portfolio)'s annual letter came out and he followed up with a lengthy interview on CNBC where he talked about how much moreApple(AAPL) stock Berkshire now owned - and how he was the one who bought most of it - I have gotten a lot of email questions asking about his purchase.This is not the first time I have received a slew of emails questioning the logic of one of Buffett's investments. Since I have been writing articles about investing, he has made four investments that really got a reaction from value investors who doubted the logic of what he was doing. These include: Buffett's initial purchase of railroad stocks and his subsequent purchase of all of Burlington Northern, his investment inIBM(IBM) despite him having said he does not invest in tech stocks, his investment in the four major U.S. airlines despite the fact he has said the airline industry is a terrible one for investors and now his investment in Apple.Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE:BRK.A)(NYSE:BRK.B) investment in Apple is far from the most controversial of these cases. A bunch of other value investors like the stock. It is a reasonably priced stock on an enterprise value basis - Apple has a lot of net cash, so its market cap exaggerates the valuation being put on the company. But, each of these investments by Buffett is an example of him moving into an area he had not previously touched. I am not sure Buffett ever invested in a railroad stock despite the fact that when he started his career - in the early 1950s - railroad stocks were a much bigger part of the investment landscape than they are today. Buffett may not have bought tech stocks before IBM - but it is, in most every other respect, the kind of stock Buffett would normally buy.makeArticleAd();Also, Buffett previously said the reason he never ownedMicrosoft(MSFT) was because no matter whether it was true or not - people would assume the purchase was the result of inside information from his friend,Bill Gates(Trades, Portfolio). He also said, however, that at one pointMicrosoft stockgot to a price - presumably, this is sometime after the 2008 financial crisis - that seemed low to him. Buffett rarely talks about whether the price of a stock seems low, high, etc. unless he understands something about that business and that industry. So, it is not unreasonable to think Buffett believes he understands some things about Microsoft. And those things might allow him to - within a very wide value range - know whether even a tech stock like Microsoft is cheap or not.Now, let's look at Apple. What does Buffett see in that stock? The number one thing that appeals to Buffett about Apple is something that should not matter at all to you. Buffett is attracted to Apple's size. It is a huge stock. Buffett said on that same CNBC interview I mentioned that Berkshire was unlikely to take a bigger than 10% stake in a company because of the problems that presents. Berkshire has ended up with more than 10% of a company's stock, but that has often been helped along by share repurchases on the part of the company itself.Right now, Ted Weschler and Todd Combs are each running $10 billion portfolios at Berkshire. Those are the small portfolios. Buffett is investing at a whole order of magnitude more in size. But, let's start with just the kind of ideas Weschler and Combs need to come up with.Assume you are running a $10 billion portfolio that is fully invested in common stocks. Further assume you want to avoid buying more than 10% of a company's stock. Now, assume you are a concentrated type investor the way Buffett is. As I write, my own portfolio is 65% invested in just two stocks:Frost(CFR) andBWX Technologies(BWXT). It is 85% invested in just three stocks. The third stock, however, is a micro-cap. Managers investing billions of dollars cannot even look at a micro-cap. The very smallest stocks they can possibly buy are things like Frost and BWX Technologies. So, how much of their portfolio could they put in those two stocks? Remember, I have 65% of my portfolio in those stocks.Well, if you are managing $10 billion, and you are buying stock in a company with a market cap of about $6 billion (which is about the size of Frost and BWX), you can put just under $600 million into the company without crossing the 10% ownership threshold. So, say you have two good ideas that are each $6 billion companies - put them both together and you get just 12% of your portfolio in those stocks. Now, for me personally, I do not want to spend time worrying about a stock that is much less than 20% of my portfolio. Here, we are talking about stocks that are 6% of your portfolio if you buy absolutely as much of them as possible. You see the problem. And I have understated it.Buffett is running about 10 times what Weschler and Combs are running individually. And neither Frost nor BWX Technologies is a small company. Within its niche of Texan banks, Frost is the biggest. And within its niche of nuclear work for governments rather than civilians, BWX Technologies is the biggest. So, Buffett cannot be looking for companies that have market caps of $6 billion. He wants companies with market caps of $60 billion or even $600 billion. Apple has a market cap of even more than $600 billion. So, here we have a company where instead of putting just 5% of your portfolio into the stock at the very most, you might get the chance to put 10%, 20% or even 50% of your portfolio into the stock. When Buffett was running his partnership, he liked to put 25% into his best idea. In the case ofAmerican Express(AXP), he even went beyond that. If we do a little math with the amount of money Buffett manages at Berkshire, we can see that ideas in the $100 billion to $700 billion market cap range are really, really useful to him because he can potentially deploy $10 billion to $70 billion (10% of the value of these kinds of companies) into such gigantic public companies.Think about what kinds of companies you have in the $100 billion to $700 billion range. It is pretty limited. Buffett likes focused companies. He likes brands. A great idea for Buffett is something likeCoca-Cola(KO), American Express,Wells Fargo(WFC),Moody's(MCO), or Gillette. Those were great ideas because they were not just big companies. They did very few things in a very big way. Buffett's stake in Gillette got swapped intoProcter & Gamble(PG) stock. He eventually did a deal to get out of P&G by taking control of Duracell. Duracell is a big brand like Gillette. P&G is an even bigger company, but only a few of its brands are huge in a way that is useful to Buffett. P&G as a whole is more diversified into things that are not really as good as Gillette is on a standalone basis.Not only is Apple a huge company, it is a hugely focused company, which is attractive to Buffett. Apple's fortunes are now tied to one brand (as they really always have been) and largely to one product (the iPhone). When you listen to what Buffett said about Apple, you realize how important this is. Buffett said he likes Apple. He said he sees how integral the iPhone is to the lives of people - especially young people - who now have it. And he says that he sees - at places like the Nebraska Furniture Mart stores he owns - that people upgrade from one iPhone to another instead of considering competing brands. So, the investment thesis is surprisingly focused for a giant company. It really has to do with one brand and one product, the iPhone. That is it. Buffett can evaluate the stickiness of one consumer product and one brand. That makes Apple easier to understand than Procter & Gamble orDisney(DIS) or other giant consumer-oriented businesses that are actually much more diversified. Apple is not diversified. That is the potential attraction.Moving on, Buffett thinks Apple, like IBM, is not going to do a lot of big acquisitions. He thinks the company is going to buy back a lot of its own stock. This is a very common theme in a lot of his investments. One of the surest signs you can find for a ""catalyst"" that might change his thinking about a company is that company turning inward and focusing on the things it does best while dedicating its free cash flow toward reducing its share count year after year instead of expanding into other areas.Buffett is not an activist investor, but if you look at those areas where he has been most vocal - either while on a board, in the way he abstained from a vote or what he said to the press - it is almost always a capital allocation decision. It is usually related to the issuance of company stock. Sometimes it is related to overpaying. Nonetheless, he is constantly urging the management of the companies he invests in to focus on widening their moat, doing what they do best and investing in themselves at a reasonable price (by buying back their own stock) rather than investing in somebody else by overpaying.The only times I can think of Buffett having any complaints about Coca-Cola had to do with an acquisition the company wanted to do (at too high a price) or with giving stock to top executives. The stock grants to executives incident at Coke was reported in the press as Buffett complaining about executives being overpaid. I think the reason he abstained on that vote had more to do with the fact the company would be permitted to cause a lot of dilution if it used the program to the full extent it was asking shareholder approval for. So, it was probably more about Buffett wanting Coca-Cola to shrink its share count rather than grow it.When Buffett was asked on CNBC about the growth prospects of both IBM and Apple, he answered by talking about share buybacks. Before Buffett bought it, IBM had one of the longest and most aggressive histories of buying back its own stock you can find at any public company. A lot of Berkshire's investments have this feature. Look at how much American Express has shrunk its share count since Buffett bought that position. Or look at how much Coca-Cola has bought back of its own stock. In both cases, I'm pretty sure Berkshire's investments are worth at least 33% more than they otherwise would be because these companies have shrunk their share count by more than 25% while Berkshire owned them. Buffett mentioned in the CNBC interview that Apple had bought back almost 5% of its stock in a year. That is unlikely to be a one-time thing. Apple will have problems with where its cash is located - it will end up with a lot of cash that would be taxed if brought back to the U.S. - but it does not need cash to grow, it cannot grow that fast anymore organically and it does not do big acquisitions.For a tech company its size, Apple has historically been especially averse to acquisitions. A company as profitable as Apple that does not use money on high-priced, transformative acquisitions is eventually going to have to use that cash to buy back its own stock. There just are not any other realistic options. It could pay dividends; and because of Berkshire's own tax status, Buffett would benefit at least as much from dividends as from (fairly or overpriced) buybacks. He does not mind dividends, and he certainly does not mind buybacks at stocks he chose in the first place.What about Apple's lack of future growth? I think this actually attracts Buffett. That sounds counterintuitive. But, let me explain. Apple is a tech stock and a consumer product company. The most dangerous time to invest in tech stocks and consumer product stocks is when they sell a high-priced product to a small pool of customers. The reason for this is that it allows market entry at the low end. If you are selling $1,000 watches or $10,000 computers, someone can come in selling a cheaper and more basic version of the product to a large group of people who have never owned the product. All sorts of market leaders run into this problem. They have the biggest dollar share of the industry, but economies of scale - and certainly gains in experience - are driven in large by the unit volume you do. The leader is in an awkward position because trying to expand the market cuts into their profitability on a per-customer basis.If you are selling computers to corporate customers - you are not dreaming of the day when every living room in America can have a cheap, basic desktop. That future is potentially bad for you in several ways. One, it teaches whoever you are competing with a lot about many of the things you do. Two, it cheapens the image of what you are selling. Three, it changes the way you will have to sell what you are selling. Almost all technology, especially any sort of consumer tech, follows this pattern. It can be very tough for investors because it leads to a two-stage adoption of the technology.In phase one, one leader establishes their dominance in the ""pro"" market and the stock looks great. But, in phase two, another - and usually different - leader establishes their dominance in the ""consumer"" market. Then that stock looks great at the expense of the first leader. We could be talking about computers or cell phones here. But if you go back further in history, TVs and radios followed the same pattern too. These things are always invented long, long before you remember them being invented, but were not adopted quickly. People tend to remember when they started seeing cell phones everywhere, when they started using the internet in their own home and so on. Those years have nothing to do with when these products were first invented, commercialized and so forth. Often, there was a company you have completely forgotten about that made and lost a fortune before the time period you even think of the new consumer tech as being suddenly important to society.What does this have to do with Apple? It is part of a broader question. Just how ""moaty"" are consumer technology companies? At least on one side of the economic value equation, companies like Apple,Facebook(FB) andAlphabet's Google (GOOG)(GOOGL) depend entirely on the mass appeal of their product. We call them technology companies. Internally, I am sure they seem very technical to those inside the organization. But how much does technology drive the economic returns at these companies? And, at this point, how easy is it to attack any of these business models on some technical difference between your product and theirs? How much of what makes the iPhone successful is the Apple brand, the fact a customer already owns an iPhone and is used to using it, the fact a customer's friends, family and peers already own an iPhone and, as a consequence, the fact other entrepreneurs and organizations have invested time money and effort in trying to reach people by designing products to be used on an iPhone?In other words, has the iPhone become the default choice for customers because the Apple brand is good enough, the status quo is good enough, people are not all going to jump on another bandwagon together and the suppliers are going to be where the demand is? Is the iPhone always going to be the easiest choice? This is exactly the same question for Facebook and Google. A very long time ago, I wrote that while I did not ownGoogle stockand did not know how the organization would develop over time as a company, I did know that understanding anything technical about a search engine no longer mattered. Google does not need to be the world's best search engine to be the world's most popular search engine. The advantages it has are too entrenched and the differences between one set of search results and another are so small - Google does not really have to compete on quality anymore. Google is enough of a brand and search is enough of a commodity that it does not matter.The things that got Apple to the position it is now in are not necessarily the things that will keep it there. A lot of readers emailed me asking about Apple's brand and whether it would last. The answer to that is yes and no. It will be a recognizable brand that is seen as good enough in a decade or two. I would be very surprised if that changed. On the other hand, I would be surprised if the Apple brand was seen as being particularly innovative or standing for very specific design choices or anything like that in a decade or two. Coca-Cola is a great brand, but it is not a very specific brand. It cannot be anymore. When people think cola they think Coca-Cola. And when people think phone - they think Apple. But, Apple will not need to convince anyone to try a smartphone for the first time anymore. They do not really even have to convince anyone to try an Apple product for the first time anymore.Apple has very high returns on the money it actually ties up in its business. The numbers look lower because they have excess cash. Likewise, the stock looks more expensive than it is because it has a lot of excess cash. If Apple's sales grow somewhere between nominal GDP and the rate of inflation in the countries where it operates in and the company dedicates every cent it makes - or more, since Apple already has net cash - to buying back its own shares, it will still be a ""growth"" stock on an EPS basis. For an example of this, see BWX Technologies. It is not really a growth company at all in terms of what it does. It does not gain new customers (outside of the U.S. Navy). It does not win totally new projects (outside of the carriers and subs it has long provided reactors for). And it does not even get many more orders for a higher build rate for the number of those ships now than it did in the recent past. Despite all that, the company just put out a press release saying it expected a ""low double-digit"" EPS growth rate for the next three to five years. That is a growth stock, but it is one because it is doing something very, very profitable on a return on capital basis. It is retaining all the business it already has and growing the business it retains a tiny but consistent bit, and then it is taking all the money it makes and buying back its own stock. When a super high-quality business buys back its own stock, it is not impossible to turn an underlying 5% type growth rate in how much more your customers actually want into more like a 10% growth rate in the earnings you report per share.IBM is another good example of that. In the 10 years before Buffett bought the stock, it was not very good at company-wide revenue growth. Over the last decade, IBM had close to 9% annual EPS growth at the same time it had close to zero percent revenue growth. A lot of that is accomplished simply by not growing the assets you tie up in the business at all (IBM's net tangible assets actually shrank over the last decade) and then taking all your free cash flow and - instead of growing assets like most companies do - use it to reduce your share count.What Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio) sees in Apple is probably a slow growth, wide moat consumer brand that can use all its free cash flow to buy back its own stock and thereby be a high-growth stock in terms of EPS, even while it is slow growth in terms of additional units sold. Apple may not be a growth company anymore, but that does not mean it cannot be a growth stock. All Buffett cares about is the growth in earnings per share. So, he is not necessarily betting Apple can sell a lot more iPhones over the next five to 10 years. What Buffett's betting on is Apple's ability to report a lot more in earnings per share over the next five to 10 years.Disclosures: Long CFR, BWXTStart afree 7-day trial of Premium Membershipto GuruFocus.Premium MembersThis article first appeared onGuruFocus."

The Nike Inc (NKE) Stock Dividend Is a Slam Dunk;3/2/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsI have been a big backer ofStarbucks Corporation(NASDAQ:SBUX) for a number of years. The company's strong leadership, impressive growth and iconic brand were all attractive. The dividendwas another motive. Management's focus has led to years of double-digit growth. That's why I'm kicking myself for missing one very similar stock:Nike Inc(NYSE:NKE).makeArticleAd();Source:Alessio Jacona via FlickrSBUX stock and NKE stock have essentially mirrored each other over the past five years. I have worn the dunce cap more than once trying to pick growth stocks, value stocks and special-situation plays.But the one area I've excelled in? PickingFuture Blue Chipstocks.I may have passed on NKE stock over the years, but that is no longer the case. Thankfully, the stock has been under pressure. Long-term investors focused on the business and dividend now have time to buy. Long pauses and notable pullbacks are welcomed in high-quality stocks.Is Nike stock high-quality? You bet.The Positives for NKE StockOne could argue that a price-to-earnings ratio of 25.5 is still a bit expensive. But one could also point out that this is near the low-end of Nike's five-year range, as shown below:Valuation is a consideration for me, but it is not the most important factor in the game. I care about the long-term business. I care that there's a long runway to its success and that when the growth does eventually slow, that there will be a continual flow of income, both for the business and into my pockets.7 Stocks That Will Hit All-Time Highs in 2017On that note, Nike stock yields just 1.3%. But, its dividend has been growing by double-digits for basically the past 10 years. I say basically because Nike ""only"" raised its dividend by 9.7% in 2009. It's noteworthy that NKE not only continued to pay a dividend through the financial crisis, but also continued raising said payout.Year Quarterly Dividend Growth 2012 $0.09 15.4% 2013 0.10 11.1% 2014 0.12 20% 2015 0.14 16.7% 2016 0.16 14.3% 2017 0.18 12.5%While Nike's dividend growth has been slowing over the past few years, the hope is that it will continue at a double-digit pace. A big part of selecting Future Blue Chip stocks is the company's focus on dividend growth. Combined with reasonable sales and earnings growth, the dividend acts as the third catalyst in a 1-2-3 punch.The Negatives for NKE StockThat said, what if Nike cannot grow at its predicted pace? Then it would certainly will be viewed as overvalued down the stretch.For a look at what happens when sales and earnings slow more than expected, look no further thanUnderArmour Inc(NYSE:UA) (NYSE:UAA). Despite being a high-quality sports apparel manufacturer,UAA stock has been decimated.Nike's high single-digit sales growth expected for this year and next year is good, but not necessarily great. It makes me wonder if the company's original goal of $50 billion in revenue in 2020 is indeed achievable, especially with increased competition fromAdidas AG (ADR)(OTCMKTS:ADDYY) and UA. According to E*Trade, analysts currently expect NKE to generate $46.3 billion in sales in 2020.Additionally, Nike has missed on sales expectations in three of the past five quarters and on four of the past eight. Notably though, it has beat EPS estimates for at least 12 straight quarters.Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Is Moving Markets - LiterallyOne additional concern is Trump's stance on imports. Apparel companies are notorious for producing overseas at low rates and importing those products into the U.S. to distribute. If a border tax hits NKE stock, it's not clear how it could impact the business, but it's unlikely to be a positive.The Bottom Line for NikeI don't expect the president to push for import tariffs that will wildly punish Nike stock overnight. While it's possible, we also have to consider the benefit NKE should receive from lower taxes (although itseffective tax ratein fiscal 2016 was only 18.7%).Nike may ultimately fall a bit short of its lofty goals. But it's unlikely the king of athletic apparel will give up the throne any time soon. UA's products are good, but the two companies can co-exist in today's world. Plus, it's hard to picture Nike falling into second place.Given Nike's double-digit earnings and dividend growth, I think this is a noteworthy long-term stock for investors who have time and patience to see it continually grow into a better and better investment.With any luck, a pullback will knock NKE stock back down, giving investors a better buying opportunity.As of this writing, Bret Kenwell held a long position in SBUX and NKE.More From InvestorPlaceSnapchat IPO: Lofty Snap Inc (SNAP) Walks on EggshellsWall Street Is Finally Bailing on Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) StockThe 7 Best ETFs for Market-Beating ReturnsThe postThe Nike Inc (NKE) Stock Dividend Is a Slam Dunkappeared first onInvestorPlace."

That index consists of the 500 most important stocks in the U.S. market (not necessarily the largest), and comprises 70%-80% of total U.S. market capitalization, according to Standard & Poor's itself.It would thus seem that AAPL on its own couldn't move the index all that much. After all, 1 out of 500 is a small fraction, even as big as Apple is. Yet Apple stock still drives about 3.6% of the index's returns.Snapchat IPO: Lofty Snap Inc (SNAP) Walks on EggshellsGiven a 19% YTD return, then, Apple alone has pushed the S&P 500 higher by about 0.69% in just two months. Fully one-tenth of the broad market index's growth has comejust from AAPL.And Apple isn't the only large-cap driver. AMZN stock, now up 9% for the year, has added 0.2 points, or 3%, of the index's growth. The three largest financials in the index -JPMorgan Chase & Co.(NYSE:JPM),Wells Fargo & Co(NYSE:WFC) andBank of America Corp(NYSE:BAC) - have added roughly 7% of the S&P 500's performance so far in 2017.In other words, roughly 20% of the broad market's gains in 2017 from come just from five major stocks. And the figure since the election is actually above one-quarter, with the three major financials creating 15% of the S&P's 12%-plus post-election gains.That's not to say that market strength is a mirage. Fully three-quarters of S&P 500 stocks are positive in 2017 as of this writing. But it has been a more top-heavy market than usual - and the impact of Apple stock, in particular, is even higher in other well-known indexes.AAPL and the Dow Jones Industrial AverageThe DJIA is different from most other indices in that it's weighted by price, not market value. The most heavily weighted component in the Dow isGoldman Sachs Group Inc(NYSE:GS), because its stock price is over $250. The least important Dow Jones component isGeneral Electric Company(NYSE:GE), trading just above $30.Yes, it's weird.That means Apple stock actually has the seventh-highest weighting in the DJIA. (AMZN isn't even excluded, because of its $800-plus handle.) But Apple's strong gains still mean that it has driven over 12% of the Dow Jones' year-to-date  increase.Apple isn't alone in driving the index.Boeing Co(NYSE:BA) has added another 12%, GS roughly 9% and JPM another 8%. Again, the gains are somewhat concentrated; over 40% of the Dow's year-to-date increase is coming from just these four stocks.Still, like in the S&P 500, the gains are broad-based. Only four Dow components are in the red in 2017, including the two energy issues.Exxon Mobil Corporation(NYSE:XOM) andChevron Corporation(NYSE:CVX) both have declined in 2017. But the 7% increase YTD has come in large part from just a few stocks - and, like the S&P 500, the same is true since November.Apple and the Nasdaq-100The Nasdaq-100 is a tech titan-heavy index. Thus, it should be no surprise that AAPL stock has a major weighting in the index. Apple represents almost 12% of the Nasdaq-100 - the year's best-performing major index so far, with an increase just under 11%.Apple stock has been the major driver, accounting for over 20% of that growth.Facebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) has added another 9%, as has AMZN.7 Stocks That Will Hit All-Time Highs in 2017Some 40% of the index's YTD gains have come from those three stocks. And they haven't had as much help from their fellow tech titans.Alphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL) andMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) actually have lagged the Nasdaq-100 so far this year. That might be a good thing if those stocks pick up the pace - but it does leave the index somewhat reliant on just a few key issues.Of course, that's the nature of the Nasdaq-100, relative to the S&P 500 in particular, which has more stocks and a broader mandate.But no matter the index, Apple stock is important. And that just shows how embedded it is in the U.S. investing world. Pretty much every index has significant exposure to AAPL - which means that most diversified investors own Apple in some way, shape or form.The strength in the broad markets in 2017 hasn't come solely from AAPL stock - but it has helped. And long investors - even those who don't own Apple shares directly - should be rooting for Apple to keep climbing.The author has no direct positions in any securities mentioned … but like most investors does own index funds which include securities mentioned, including AAPL.More From InvestorPlaceThe 10 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold ForeverHow to Handle Red-Hot Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

How the Dogs of the Dow Are Faring in the Market Rally;3/2/2017;"TheDow Jones Industrials(DJINDICES: ^DJI) have been on fire so far in 2017, setting new   all-time records on more than a dozen occasions in the first two   months of the year and climbing above the 21,000 level for the   first time on March 1. Yet rather than investing in the entire   Dow, some dividend investors follow a strategy known as the Dogs   of the Dow, which involves picking just a handful of the   components that make up the venerable average. Two months in and   after a huge rally, now's a good time to check in and see how the   Dogs of the Dow are faring and what explains their performance in   2017.How the Dogs of the Dow are faring in 2017To find out which stocks make up the Dogs of the Dow, you just   have to do one simple thing. Pick the 10 stocks as of the end of   2016 that had the highest dividend yields, and then buy shares of   them in equal dollar amounts. Then, hold onto all 10 stocks   throughout the year.So far in 2017, the Dogs of the Dow are lagging slightly   behind the Dow overall. On average, the Dogs are up 5%, compared   to a nearly 7% return for the unmodified Dow.makeArticleAd();The biggest reason for the poor performance from the Dogs of   the Dow is that three of the 10 stocks the strategy tracks have   lost ground in 2017, compared to just five overall for the Dow   30. The biggest loser has beenExxonMobil(NYSE: XOM) , which has had to deal with renewed concerns about   whether the energy markets can keep clawing back more of the   ground that they lost during the plunge in crudeoil   pricesin 2015.Chevron(NYSE: CVX) has also produced year-to-date losses for similar   reasons. In addition,Verizon(NYSE: VZ) has had to deal with new price-war considerations,   including the potential merger of its No. 3 and No. 4 rivals in   the U.S. wireless telecom industry, and is also reacting   adversely to threats of higher interest rates.Another reason for underperformance is that the Dogs didn't   get to include the year's best performer so far.Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) has jumped more than 20%, carrying forward   momentum from 2016 as investors have regained confidence in the   company's long-term prospects. Even though some investors worry   that a lack of innovative new products in Apple's visible   pipeline pose a long-term threat to the growth of the business,   the company has still been able to use the iPhone's success and   the loyalty toward its ecosystem to drive business.Don't count the Dogs outThat said, the Dogs of the Dow have had their share of success   stories.Cisco SystemsandMerckhave risen by double-digit percentages, but the most important   winner so far in 2017 has beenBoeing(NYSE: BA) , which has climbed 18% since the beginning of the   year. Calls from the Trump administration to increase defense   spending have helped push the aerospace and defense giant higher,   and a strong commercial aerospace market continues to make   investors optimistic about Boeing. Yet even here, the Dogs of the   Dow haven't benefited as much as the Dow 30, because Boeing's   high share price has produced outsized gains for the average but   not for the equal-weighted Dogs.More importantly, it's still early in the year. The Dogs of   the Dow tend to move in a manner similar to a value-based   strategy, rewarding stocks that have lagged in the past. That's   very muchnotthe way that the stock market has acted lately, instead riding   positive momentum from late 2016 and continuing to reward earlier   winners rather than creating a rotation of new gainers.In particular, the Dogs include several stocks that could   benefit greatly from anticipated growth in certain sectors.Caterpillarin particular is well poised to boost its profits in North   America if construction and infrastructure activity rise going   forward. Pharmaceutical stocks have gotten hit hard recently, but   if healthcare reform avoids major pressure to their profit, then   the shares could rebound and help the Dogs to a greater extent   than they would the overall Dow 30.The Dogs of the Dow are lagging slightly behind the overall   Dow, but that doesn't mean that the strategy is a bad one to use.   A lot can happen over the rest of 2017, and you should watch   closely to see if the Dogs of the Dow can catch up and surpass   the Dow 30 in the months to come.10 stocks we like better than BoeingWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Why Are These 2 Tech Titans Trading at a Huge Discount?;3/2/2017;"Sometimes Mr. Market gets confused and prices companies at a   premium or discount to their true value. While big companies such   asApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) andVerizon(NYSE: VZ) historically trade at a discount to the overall   market, they're currently trading at an even deeper discount than   usual.Verizon's share price has mostly stood still while the market   continued to rally over the past year. Apple, meanwhile, is   trading around the same P/E ratio as it did at the beginning of   last year, while the S&P 500 is trading 21% higher on a P/E   basis. Let's look at the numbers and see why both these tech   titans are trading at massive discounts.Wall Street might be missing something on these two. Image     source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();Verizon's 15-year lowVerizon's P/E ratio for the trailing 12 months is a mere 15.5.   On a forward basis, it's just 12.9. That compares with the   S&P 500's trailing P/E of 26.9. Verizon is trading at just   0.58 times the P/E ratio of the broader index. The last time it   was even below 0.65 was in 2002, when the telecom industry   tanked, according to analyst Craig Moffett of   MoffettNathanson.Historically, Verizon trades for just an 11% discount. The 42%   discount it's trading at today represents a massive buying   opportunity for long-term value investors -- not to mention that   Verizon is also trading at a lower forward P/E compared withAT&T(NYSE: T) , which trades for 14.3 times analysts' 2017 EPS   estimates.At the same time, it's worth looking at why Mr. Market is   placing such a hefty discount on the wireless carrier.First and foremost, the competition in the wireless industry   is increasingly fierce. Pressure fromT-Mobile(NASDAQ: TMUS) has finally gotten to Verizon, putting pressure on   its pricing. Verizon recently introduced an unlimited-data plan   in an effort to compete with the value offered by T-Mobile's   plans. AT&T also bowed to the pressure, opening its   unlimited-data plan to all customers and dropping the price.Image source: Verizon.However, the strength of Verizon's wireless network and its   position on the leading edge of 5G network development give it a   significant competitive advantage over the long term.   Additionally, its massive retail customer base -- the largest in   the U.S. wireless industry -- will continue to throw off cash for   its investments in its wireless network and digital advertising   and video. That should allow the stock to rise back up toward its   usual valuation levels over time.In the meantime, investors can get a juicy 4.6% dividend for   their patience.Apple's recent run may be just the startShares of Apple have been on a tear over the last nine months,   increasing 46%. That significantly outpaces the 14% increase the   S&P 500 saw in the same period. But Apple was trading for a   35% discount on a P/E basis in 2015 and a 26% discount in   2016.The largest company in the market typically trades for a   discount to the S&P 500, but not nearly as deep as Apple's.   Over the past 10 years, the average discount for the largest   company by market cap was 16% to the S&P 500's P/E, according   to BMO Capital's Tim Long. Apple shares traded near that level in   2012, 2013, and 2014, but the market hasn't caught up with the   explosion in earnings from the release of the iPhone 6 at the end   of 2014.Today, Apple trades around a 25% discount to the S&P 500,   below that 16% baseline. While the market is down on Apple's slow   iPhone sales growth, there are a few reasons to believe Apple's   earnings will continue to expand.The iPhone 7 Plus. Image source: AppleFirst of all, the company continues to execute on its massive   capital returns program. Share buybacks will force earnings per   share to increase at a faster rate than net income.Second, Apple's services business continues to grow at a   strong pace.Services revenue is higher margin than Apple's   core revenue.As such, it has an outsize impact on Apple's profit growth.Investors looking for value have two great options with   Verizon and Apple. While the latter is trading at an all-time   high, it still has room to run. Meanwhile, Verizon is trading at   historic lows while maintaining strong competitive advantages,   indicating it should outpace the market from here.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Timeless Lessons From the 2017 DJCO Meeting – Part I;3/2/2017;"As we all know, Warren Buffett andCharlie Munger(Trades,Portfolio) hold theBerkshire Hathaway(NYSE:BRK.A)(NYSE:BRK.B) shareholder meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, every year. During the past two years there were more than 40,000 people who attended the meeting. Most people attend the Berkshire meeting as an annual pilgrimage as well as a get-together with fellow value investor friends.By contrast there were only about 400 people who attended theDaily Journal Corp.(DJCO) meeting, or approximately 1% that of the Berkshire meeting. The DJCO meeting is also held in the middle of the week, not the weekend. Therefore, for those who are not in Los Angeles, it is a very time-consuming effort. For me, it is a rare opportunity to pay tribute to the great Charlie Munger as well as to connect with a very intelligent group of investors.This year marked my fourth time to participate in the Daily Journal shareholder meeting. All the questions were high quality. After the meeting, Munger unexpectedly and generously stayed for an extra three hours to answer questions with a small group of cult members. Today I'd like to share a few observations and thoughts from the 2017 DJCO meeting.makeArticleAd();First of all, and this is almost the theme of this year's meeting, Munger repeatedly stressed the importance of deferred gratification. For most people, deferred gratification is hard to practice but if you can, your life will be different. Munger's success has a lot to do with deferred gratification. He cited a few examples. For instance, China's success is largely through deferred gratification - when the Chinese were poor, they managed to save half of the income to invest for the future. They rarely got a chance to enjoy anything, but boy did that lead to the prosperity of hundreds of millions of Chinese.Another example of deferred gratification is how medical students eventually become doctors. We all know that in the U.S. it is a long journey to become a doctor - you have to work hard for many years to become one. Munger said that, compared with derivatives traders, he preferred to be associated with doctors.Below are a few direct quotes from Munger.""I lived my whole life with people who have deferred gratification; they don't have fun, but they get wealthy. You end up with a lot of rich dead people - what good is that? But it does work. Your grave will look nice to outsiders and incite a lot of envy.""""I have a different feeling than the rest of America. I wish we weren't producing all this natural gas. I'd be delighted to just have it lie there untapped for decades in the future and pay extra once Arabs use up their oil. Our reserves not going away are like retaining the topsoil of Iowa. You wouldn't ship the topsoil to Greenland. There's not enough deferred gratification to sell our oil. Same for chemical feedstocks - use them slowly. I am sure I am right and the other 99% of the people are wrong. Nobody else in America seems to feel my way, but I believe in deferred gratification.""One good thing about what we're doing is that it's slow, but once you succeed it's very sticky business, and the fact that it's difficult to do means it's difficult for people to change much - if you slog through, it's a big market and the people have no option but to charge ahead - the fact that's it's so awful to grind through means people may not want to get in.""Second, Buffett and Munger are exceptionally rational and adaptive. We all know that Munger gave a speech on human psychological misjudgments. One of the misjudgments is commitment and consistency bias. It is our nature to adhere to our pre-established view and if we shout it out in public, we pound it in. Over the past few decades, Buffett and Munger have consistently expressed the view that the airlines have the worst business model and that technology stocks are outside their circle of competency. But when the situation changed, they changed their point of view by investing heavily in airlines and technology stocks such asApple(AAPL) andIBM(IBM).What's more admirable is how their view on airlines and Apple changed. The ideas were brought by Ted Weschler and Todd Combs. They were able to convince Buffett and Munger to take another look at the airlines and Apple from another angle and they did. Munger also said that the investment in airlines is not a cinch but when the competitive environment has changed, they made a decision to adapt.""If you're in a game and learning more and honing skills, of course you do better over time. Berkshire would be a very modest company if Warren never learned anything. We went out and bought whole entire businesses - something we'd not have done early on as stock investors. And Iscar at five times book value, Ben Graham would've never bought that. We've learned better over time, and we can keep learning and are still doing it. He's changed when he's buying airlines, and he's changed when he's buying Apple. The nice thing about the game we're in is that we can keep learning. We're in the press for airline stocks when in 2013 we thought it was a joke, it was such a terrible business. Today, if you put all our holdings together, we own a small airline. It violates the total catechism. It's the same thing for railroads scaring us away with all this trucking competition - it was a terrible business for 80 years, and then we become a massive owner when they finally got it down to four main railroads. This morning I was with my daughter-in-law, and she bought round-trip tickets to Europe for $400 with taxes - huh [aghast at how cheap it was]? Maybe we shouldn't be in the airline stocks. I frequently talk to Warren about the old days. We shot fish in a barrel. We even waited until they slowed down and used a shotgun. We get little edges now while before had total cinches. But it isn't any less interesting. We boughtExxonMobil(XOM) as a cash substitute - we thought it'd do a little better than cash at the time - but early on we never would've done that. Think what changed when we bought Apple with the hooting we've done about high tech. 'Apple and a bunch of airlines' is now a lead story about us in the press. But we're just adapting to a business that's gotten a lot more difficult. I don't think we've gone crazy. I think we're adapting. Now the odds are just a little in our favor. We'll take that advantage, but it's harder. You marry the best person who will have you. Be satisfied with the type of advantage we didn't used to get, caused by getting so enormously rich - it's not a bad trade-off.""Munger also emphasized the importance of patience and being prepared. The best opportunities are rare and transient so we have to be patient and be prepared to seize these opportunities. Munger gave us an inspiring example. He had been reading Barron's magazine for more than 50 years and only found one good idea from Barron's articles. It was a ridiculously cheap auto parts company. Munger bought the junk bond as well as the common stock at the cost of about $1 a share. He held for a few years and sold them at $15 per share for a total of profit of $80 million. And then he met Li Lu and thought Li Lu was very unusual. Li Lu also only invested in China, which is a much less efficient market. Munger gave Li Lu the $80 million profits he made from the auto parts company and Li Lu turned this into $400 million. Essentially through two investments, Munger turned a few million into $400 million. This example illustrates the importance of patience, deferred gratification and concentration.More to come in my next article.Start afree seven-day trialof Premium Membership to GuruFocus.Premium MembersThis article first appeared onGuruFocus."

Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT) Criticizes Border Tax, And Rightfully So;3/2/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTheDow Jones Industrial Averagetoppled another milestone Wednesday, breaching 21,000. One reason markets have continued to hit new highs is the expectation that President Donald Trump will soon unveil a plan for lower taxes on both corporations and consumers, which comes with a caveat that would hurtWal-Mart Stores Inc(NYSE:WMT), among other retailers.makeArticleAd();Source:Mike Mozart via FlickrTreasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin told reporters last week- includingMaria Bartiromo, my colleague at Fox Business - that tax reform is the primary objective.While the plan is heavily anticipated throughout the market, one large aspect of it has the retail industry on edge: the border-adjustment tax.The president has hinted that corporate taxes will favor U.S. exporters over importers, and earlier this month it was announced that more than 100 retail companies had joined a coalition against a border-adjustment tax that would affect imports from other countries while leaving exports untouched.The group is called Americans for Affordable Products, and Walmart,Target Corporation(NYSE:TGT) andBest Buy Co Inc(NYSE:BBY) are among its most notable participants.The 3 Best Oil Stocks to Buy for Retirement InvestorsWhat This Means for WMT StockConsidering approximately 97% of all clothing and shoes sold in the United States are imported, it's no surprise that Walmart is critical of a border-adjustment tax. CFO Brett Biggs said""anything that would potentially raise prices for our customers in the U.S. is a concern for us.""Should any such tax come to fruition, the company would be forced to either eat the increased costs or pass them on to consumers.Biggs' comments came just after the company reported its fourth-quarter earnings results. Comparable store sales grew 1.8%, the strongest growth since July 2012 and tenth consecutive month of year-to-year improvement. Revenue guidance for the current quarter and fiscal year were above consensus and e-commerce sales grew 29%. A lot of the headlines focused on that along with the Jet.com acquisition, but it's also worth noting that the brick-and-mortar side of the business sans groceries seems to have found equilibrium as well.In the end, Walmart has displayed the kind of nimbleness many, including myself, weren't sure it was capable of, after having things so good for so long. There are still issues with proper shelf stocking and having items people want versus those they don't, but considering the devastating impact of food deflation and fading brick-and-mortar traffic, WMT continues to execute well. Then there's its online presence, which is growing rapidly, but still has a long way to go from aesthetics to function.When it all comes down to it, a border-adjustment tax is a tax on the middle class and businesses that already pay the highest ""effective"" tax rates in the nation. And when companies likeBoeing Co(NYSE:BA),General Electric Company(NYSE:GE) andCaterpillar Inc.(NYSE:CAT) - all of which have access to the Export-Import Bank - push for pressure on smaller retailers and even potential entrepreneurs, it's extremely distressing.The good news is that many folks on Capitol Hill, who are looking at smart economics above populism, understand that this would be a disaster, although there are smart economists out there (including several I admire) who like the idea and try to explain how adjustments in currency would mitigate harm to consumers.Why Apple Inc. (AAPL) Will Become a Trillion-Dollar CompanyI think Walmart protests too much, but either way, I suspect the border-adjustment tax is dead on arrival.As for WMT, it has the potential to rally above $80 at some point this year. All that said, I do want to add the caveat that if the border-adjustment tax does make it into law, I would look to sell my retail stocks, which would be unfortunate just as consumer spending is finally picking back up again.Curious what Wall Street insider Charles Payne really thinks?Get more behind-the-scenes insights, valuable market research and hands-on guidance including live stock recommendations from Fox Business's rising star.

3 Reasons Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock Will Keep Growing Like a Weed;3/2/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsE-commerce giantAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) has delivered returns of more than 60% to investors throughout the past year. With online shopping more popular than ever, many investors may be questioning whether AMZN stock could still be a growth play.makeArticleAd();Source:Mike Seyfang via FlickrCome on.Amazon has rapidly increased sales each year, and while that kind of expansion is more difficult to come by … no. Amazon's impressive growth isn't over yet. Nor are the breakneck gains in AMZN stock.Here are three reasons why.E-Commerce Is Just Getting StartedIt might seem like e-commerce has completely taken over the retail space as more and more stores abandon their brick-and-mortar formats and shift toward online selling. However,data from the Census Bureaushows the industry is still in the early stages. In the fourth quarter of 2016, e-commerce sales made up just 8.3% of total retail sales. So yes, e-commerce is expanding rapidly, but there's so, so much room for companies like Amazon to expand.And AMZN is well-suited to grab this market share because it still continues to look for new ways to expand its offerings. Amazon has recently pushed its way into clothing, food delivery, flower delivery, and even hand-made goods.The firm's dedication to becoming a one-stop shop for everything a person might shop for online is impressive and suggests that AMZN stock will continue to push forward.Growth in the CloudPerhaps the most compelling reason to put AMZN stock in the growth category is the firm's cloud computing arm, Amazon Web Services (AWS).7 Stocks That Will Hit All-Time Highs in 2017Amazon has already established itself as the No. 1 player in the cloud computing market, which itself is on its way to becoming a massive industry. The company's positioning bodes well for future growth.Amazon Web Services has been expanding exponentially on a yearly basis - the firm'sfourth-quarter resultsshowed that AWS sales were up 47% from a year earlier and $300 million from the quarter before. That is some jaw-dropping growth.AWS still only makes up about 8% of Amazon's overall revenue, but it's a powder keg for profits thanks to its high-margin nature - exactly why some were worried aboutAWS' recent outage.Considering the low-margin nature of the rest of Amazon's businesses, Amazon Web Services' growth is critical to AMZN stock.Brick-and-Mortar FootprintWhile it may seem counterintuitive, brick-and-mortar retail is another place where AMZN could drive some big-time growth.Amazon is working to increase its physical presence with new store formats that allow customers to come in for a physical - but still unorthodox - shopping experience.One of AMZN's most promising brick-and-mortar ventures isAmazon Go- a physical store that boasts no lines and no checkouts.Customers download the Amazon Go app and then are free to enter the store and choose whatever items they want. Amazon has developed ""Just Walk Out Technology"" which is able to detect what products have been taken or returned to shelves. That means when customers are ready, they can simply walk out of the store and their Amazon account will be charged.Amazon Go is still in the early stages, but if it rolls out more broadly, it could create a brand-new type of shopping experience.Why Apple Inc. (AAPL) May Have 1,000+ Engineers Working on ARE-commerce has caused many big-name stores to reduce their store footprints, but Amazon is working from the other direction. Setting up shop in meaningful locations with specific formats could actually be a major for growth for AMZN stock.Bottom Line for AMZN StockAmazon has ingrained itself so deeply into the retail mindset that customers are increasingly turning to Amazon for all their household products.

Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Just Succeeded Where Apple Inc. (AAPL) Failed;3/1/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL) isn't exactly a direct competitor toApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL), but the former just eclipsed the latter, and seemingly out of nowhere.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');Source: GoogleOne of the worst-kept secrets in the industry has been Apple's determination to get into the TV business. The company has been working for years trying to put together an online TV service, hoping to offer 25 channels for between $30 and $40 monthly. That project seemed to have been put on hold when AAPL and broadcasters couldn't reach an agreement on price.But Alphabet has just succeeded where Apple failed.YouTube TV - live TV from over 40 providers including the big networks for $35 per month - is now official.YouTube TV Takes on CableYouTube TVwas announced on Tuesday. Launching ""soon"" in the U.S., this is Google's skinny TV bundle for cord cutters. The four major networks are onboard. So isWalt Disney Co's(NYSE:DIS) ESPN, along with regional sports networks. Google is also including some content from its premium YouTube Red service. All told, there will be over 40 different content providers - not bad for $35 per month.Subscribers get unlimited cloud DVR storage, search powered by Google's AI, six user accounts (three streams can be active simultaneously) and the ability to watch YouTube TV on a variety of devices including smartphones, tablets, PCs and Google Chromecast.Why Apple Inc. (AAPL) Will Become a Trillion-Dollar CompanyIn other word, this is pretty much what Apple has been struggling to release.YouTubeTV is Eerily Similar to Apple's Television PlansApple has to have been watching Google's YouTube TV announcement with dismay. Its rival beat it to the punch with the streaming TV bundle it had envisioned offering with the Apple TV.What makes it even more galling is how close YouTube TV is to what AAPL was negotiating.In May 2015, AAPL andCBS Corporation(NYSE:CBS) were in talks about a subscription Apple television streaming service, butmoney was reportedly a sticking point. In December of that year, CBS CEO Les Moonves confirmed toBusiness Insiderthat his network had been in talks with Apple, and were close to settling on a monthly price to charge consumers. Moonves was throwing around $35 - exactly the price that YouTube TV is charging.Apple balked. Apparently Google was waiting in the wings.Where Does This Leave AAPL and Its TV Strategy?At this point, Apple's entire television strategy seems to be struggling.There was hope that the new Apple TV that launched in 2015 would come with a streaming TV bundle. That didn't happen. Now Apple's set-top streamer is suffering from disappointing sales. The box costs twice what Google andAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) charge for their streamers, but lacks the 4K support rivals offer.Last year, AAPL was showing off anew TV appthat would serve as a hub for streaming content, tracking use across multiple services and devices. But it failed to get buy-in fromNetflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX), making its usefulness questionable.Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Could Break $1,000 If ...Google's YouTube TV launch is the icing on the cake.Where Can Apple Go From Here?Don't expect Apple to give up on its plans, of course.The signs of a renewed push toward taking over your living room began last month. Applehired the former head of Amazon's Fire TVto take over as the head of marketing for Apple TV. This move has raised expectations that AAPL will revamp its Apple TV hardware. It also freed up the previous head of Apple TV to helplead Apple's efforts to sign content deals- something he had considerable experience in from his previous role as senior VP of content distribution atHulu.While YouTube TV offers a fixed content bundle, AAPL had always pushed for subscribers having an option to choose their own bundle, Moonves says. If the company can accomplish that goal, it still can position an Apple television streaming service as being something unique.With YouTube TV, Google may have beaten Apple to the punch when it comes to being first of the tech giants to offer a cheap way to cut the cable, but the war is likely just beginning.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceWhat Is Apple Inc.

Berkshire Hathaway: Repurchase Limit Crosses $135 Per Share;3/1/2017;"In addition to the release ofWarren Buffett(Trades,Portfolio)'s shareholder letter this past weekend,Berkshire Hathaway(BRK.A) (BRK.B) reported full-year fiscal 2016 financial results as well - so let's dive in.Berkshire reported $24 billion in net income in 2016, comparable to 2015. On 2.466 billion equivalent B shares, that's equal to roughly $9.75 per share in 2016 reported earnings.I personally make a few adjustments to try and normalize these results. First, I largely back out the roughly $6.7 billion in investment and derivatives gains included in net income (replaced by roughly $2.3 billion in income, which is equal to ~50% of the trailing five-year average). Second, I add back unreported earnings from the ""Big Five"" -The Coca-Cola Co.(KO),American Express(AXP),Wells Fargo(WFC),IBM(IBM) andApple(AAPL); by my math, there was roughly $3.1 billion (aftertax) in unreported earnings from these five holdings (the Apple stake is adjusted to reflect the disclosures Buffett made Monday morning on CNBC). Finally, I make a few other adjustments that I believe are reasonable (most notably an estimate of earnings power on the excess cash Berkshire holds and higher depreciation expense at BNSF to account for the real maintenance cost attributable to the railroad). All in, my math estimates that Berkshire Hathaway's normalized earnings power is approaching $10 per B share.makeArticleAd();For the full year, Berkshire generated $32.5 billion in cash flow from operations (a decade ago that number was ~$10 billion). Roughly $13 billion was reinvested in the business as capital expenditures with $5.1 billion and $3.8 billion spent at Berkshire Hathaway Energy and Burlington Northern Santa Fe. Another $31.4 billion was spent on acquisitions (largelyPrecision Castparts[PCP] but also $1.4 billion for bolt-on acquisitions). The net shortfall from these three buckets (roughly $12 billion) was covered by incremental long-term debt issued at low single-digit interest rates.Insurance businessesBerkshire's insurance businesses reported a pretax underwriting gain of ~$2.1 billion in 2016, an increase of 16% from 2015. The gain was attributable to Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group, where underwriting income nearly doubled, to $822 million. Within BHRG, ""Retroactive Reinsurance"" losses declined from $469 million to $49 million. It's difficult to say anything meaningful based on headline changes in the reported reinsurance results from year to year. As an example, the retroactive reinsurance agreement recently signed withAmerican International Group(AIG) - for which Berkshire received a premium of $10 billion- will generate $375 million in pretax deferred charge amortization losses for BHRG in 2017. Focusing only on the losses without considering the economics of the whole deal leads you to faulty conclusions.GEICO had another solid year of growth in 2016, with earned premiums up 12%. For the year, GEICO added nearly 1 million net auto policies in force (PIFs), compared to a net 700,000 additions in 2015. While the loss ratio increased in 2016, pressuring profits, this is a reasonable trade-off in the short term (it's worth noting that storm-related losses at GEICO increased by $260 million in 2016 as well). GEICO has a sustainable competitive advantage that becomes more powerful in an environment where consumers are increasingly cost conscious. Management has proven adept at managing the business for the long-term. GEICO will emerge from the industry's current challenges in a stronger position than it started.Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group continues to report solid numbers as well, with earned premiums increasing to $6.3 billion in 2016 (up more than 40% from 2014). The combined ratio was just shy of 90%, resulting in more than $650 million in pretax underwriting income.At the end of 2016, the float attributable to Berkshire's insurance businesses exceeded $91 billion (compared to $70 billion five years). Inclusive of the AIG deal discussed a moment ago, Berkshire's float exceeds $100 billion. In his letter, Buffett restated his belief that a decline in float, should it occur, will be very gradual - ""at the outside no more than 3% per year.""Noninsurance businesses2016 was a tough year for rails generally and BNSF specifically, with revenues falling 10% on comparable declines in volumes and average revenue per car. The coal business took a beating in 2016, with volumes and revenues down 21% and 27%, respectively; even after declining by more than one-quarter, the coal business still accounted for ~17% of BNSF's revenues in 2016. The operating ratio increased in the face of sliding revenues (meaning lower operating margins), resulting in a 16% drop in earnings. 2016 was undoubtedly a struggle for BNSF; if guidance fromUnion Pacific(UNP) is any indication, 2017 should be a step in the right direction.Berkshire Hathaway Energy reported $17.9 billion in 2016 revenues, a low single-digit decline from 2015. A small increase in pretax income ended up as a 7% increase in aftertax profits, partly attributable to a lower effective tax rate (down two points to 14%). There's plenty of room to run here: my research suggests production tax credits from wind-powered electricity generation will be a material tailwind to BHE's net income over the coming years (MidAmerican owns more wind-powered capacity than any other rate-regulated electric utility in the country).Berkshire's Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (MSR) businesses reported ~$5.6 billion in earnings in 2016, an increase of ~$1 billion versus the prior year (both measures exclude amortization of intangibles). The entirety of the gains came from the Manufacturing bucket due to the inclusion of Precision Castparts; pretax Manufacturing earnings declined in 2016 whenPrecision Castparts is backed out (largely due to a $365 million loss from the disposition of part of Lubrizol's business in the fourth quarter). MSR was also impacted by other one-time costs, such as $110 million in acquisition/integration and transition costs from the Duracell deal.Finally, Finance & Financial Products revenues increased 10% in 2016, with earnings up 4%. Clayton Homes' reported a solid year, selling more than 42,000 units (an impressive 25% increase from 2015). Strength in manufactured homes from Clayton offset less impressive results in the remainder of the business (notably at Marmon).ConclusionBook value increased by ~11% in 2016 to $115 per B share (trailing three-year CAGR of 8%). The repurchase authorization (up to 120% of book value) enables Buffett to buy back stock at ~$138 per B share. As he noted in the shareholder letter, ""purchases at that level clearly bring an instant and material benefit to continuing shareholders"". Starting at ~$170 per share, that would require a pullback of ~20%. Shares are reasonably valued at current levels.Berkshire's fortress balance sheet continues to offer significant optionality; at some unknown point in the future, it will be used to create meaningful per-share value for investors. My favorite quote from Bufett's shareholder letter addressed this in a roundabout way:""Every decade or so, dark clouds will fill the economic skies, and they will briefly rain gold. When downpours of that sort occur, it's imperative that we rush outdoors carrying washtubs, not teaspoons. And that we will do.""Disclosure:Long BRK.B, IBM and Union Pacific.Start a free seven-day trial of Premium Membership to GuruFocus.Premium MembersThis article first appeared onGuruFocus."

5 Best Performing Stocks of February;3/1/2017;"Markets set a blistering set of gains over the month with new milestones being created on a regular basis. Over the month increasingly evident that President Trump's policy proposals have gone down extremely well with investors. Additionally, economic data continued to be largely encouraging while earnings numbers have been impressive, lending a firm basis to the long-running market rally.February's PerformanceFor the month, the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq rose 4.8%, 3.7% and 3.8%, respectively after President Trump vowed to bring back millions of jobs to the U.S. Additionally, optimism over Trump's proposed market-friendly policies including tax cuts, financial de-regulation and increase in infrastructure spending benefitted all the three key indexes. Fed's positive view of the economy and rally inoil pricesas well as upbeat earnings reports also boosted investor sentiment.Encouraging Domestic DataMost of the economic reports released during the month were encouraging in nature. The ISM manufacturing index increased while the services index declined only marginally for the month of January. Retail sales increased 0.4%, following an upwardly revised 1% gain for December. Durable orders rebounded in January, increasing by 1.8%. The Leading Indicators Index gained 0.6% following an increase of 0.5% in December.CPI and PPI both moved up 0.6% in January. Construction spending increased by 0.2% in December. However, a few key reports were negative in nature. Industrial production declined 0.3% following a downwardly revised 0.6% increase for December. While durable orders fell by 0.4%, consumer confidence dropped to 111.8.Q4 GDP's Second Estimate SlipsAccording to the ""second"" estimate by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, fourth quarter output of goods and services increased at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.9% from the previous three months. This was lower than the consensus estimate of 2.1% growth. An increase in the foreign-trade deficit weighed on growth during the final three months of 2016. In the fourth quarter, exports fell 4% while imports rose 8.5%.Business investment fell lower, with spending on equipment decreasing 1.9%. Residential construction investment increased 9.6%, revised downward from an initial estimate of a 10.2% gain. However, strong gains in consumer spending had a positive impact on the domestic economy. Consumers, the torchbearers for the U.S. economy, increased spending by a solid 3%Housing Sector Recovery SlowsMost of the reports released across the month suggest that the housing sector's recovery has slowed down. Housing starts declined by 2.6% in January though building permits increased by 4.6%. The National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) Housing Market Index declined from 67 to 65 in February.In contrast, existing homes sales jumped 3.3% in January to a seasonally adjusted rate of 5.69 million, the highest level recorded in 10 years. New home sales increased 3.7% to a seasonally adjusted rate of 555,000. However, the pending home sales index declined 2.8% in January to 106.4, the lowest level in a year. The current scenario seems to be a consequence of demand outstripping supply and a sharp increase in home prices.Job Additions Rise, Increase in Hourly Earnings   DipThe U.S. added 227,000 jobs in January, higher than the consensus estimate of 174,000 job additions. This figure also exceeds December's reading of 157,000. These are the best monthly job gains since September.However, expectations that the economy is moving towards a full employment scenario weighed on workers' pay, with average hourly wages rising only 0.1% in January, lower than December's downwardly revised gain of 0.2%. Further, the unemployment rate, meantime, ticked up to 4.8% from 4.7% in January.Record Earnings Growth in Fourth QuarterThe absolute earnings total for the quarter is on track to be the highest ever. The bulk of the Q4 earnings season is now behind us, with results from only a few of S&P 500 members still awaited. As of February 17, 2017, Q4 results from 411 S&P 500 members, or 82.2% of the index's total membership had been released. Total earnings for these 411 index members are up +8% on +4.9% higher revenues, with 68.9% beating EPS estimates and 54.7% coming ahead of top-line expectations. (Read:Retail in Focus as Q4 Earnings Season Winds Down)Retail earnings grabbed the spotlight last month. Solid fourth-quarter reports from Wal-MartWMT, Macy'sM, and Home DepotHDprovided a major fillip to investor sentiment. Earlier in the month, Apple Inc.'sAAPLfirst quarter fiscal results easily topped expectations. The good show was driven by impressive sales of Apple's latest smartphone model iPhone 7 and 7 Plus.Investors Ride ""Trump Rally""The euphoria surrounding President Donald Trump's proposed market-friendly policies including the prospect of massive tax cuts and an uptick in infrastructure spending propelled markets to new highs in February. The Dow closed at an all-time high for a twelfth straight session on Feb 27, posting its longest such streak since 1987. Both the blue-chip index and S&P 500 settled at all-time high levels, while the Nasdaq closed a few points short of a record. At present, the blue-chip index continues to hover above the psychological milestone of 20,000.Trump's polices including tax cuts, repealing regulations and pickup in infrastructure outlays restored expectations of a pro-growth agenda that helped the Dow push further into record territory. Trump is also planning a multi-trillion-dollar tax cut that will boost the U.S. economy and lift corporate profits.Deregulation Ensues, Defense Spending to RiseTrump has also signed an executive order designed to scale back the Dodd-Frank Act. He views the Dodd-Frank regulatory overhaul as a harsh measure, especially, on banks as they had to beef up compliance compartments to deal with a list of new rules.Meanwhile, Trump sent both the political parties a notice on Feb 27 stating that he intends to significantly raise defense related outlay. He will seek a $54 billion hike in spending on tanks, ships and weapon systems and will trim other priorities. The defense budget will climb 10%, according to the White House, while Trump recommended $30 billion in supplementary military spending for this yearMaiden Speech to CongressUltimately, the Dow snapped its record streak of gains ahead of Trump's first speech before a joint session of Congress on the last day of the month. Profit taking ensued due to a lack of details about Trump's policies.During his speech, Trump adopted a measured approach to several contentious issues. However, he reiterated his commitment to immigration reform and replacing Obamacare with a new healthcare law. At the same time, the speech was light on details but for a request that Congress pass his trillion dollar infrastructure plan.FOMC MinutesMinutes from the Federal Reserve's January meeting adopted a similar tone, keeping alive prospects of a potential near-term interest rate hike. The minutes said that ""many participants expressed the view that it might be appropriate to raise the federal funds rate again fairly soon if incoming information on the labor market and inflation was in line with or stronger than their current expectations or if the risks of overshooting the committee's maximum-employment and inflation objectives increased.""Fed Chair Janet Yellen expects a gradual rate increase amid a modestly expanding economy and inflation that should touch the Fed's desired target rate of 2% in the near term. She said that ""at our upcoming meetings, the Fed will evaluate whether employment and inflation are continuing to evolve in line with…expectations, in which case a further adjustment of the federal funds rate would likely be appropriate.""5 Star Performers for FebruaryI ran a screen onResearch Wizardfor companies with the following parameters:(Click here to sign up for a free trial to the Research Wizard today):Percentage price change over the last 4 weeks greater than or   equal to 15% (As of Oct 31, 2016)Forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) for the current   financial year (F1) less than or equal to 20.

The likelihood of a rate hike in March has increased significantly after the central bank and Janet Yellen herself made statements to that effect. Trading also remains mostly range bound in nature.However, several market watchers now believe the absence of volatility is a sign that the rally is being powered by fundamentals instead of pure sentiment. An improving economy and strong earnings numbers lend further weight to such a proposition. The catalysts for the current rally are still firmly in place and likely to power further gains in the days ahead.Everything You Need to Know About Snapchat BEFORE It Goes   PublicYou may be curious about the buzz surrounding Snap Inc.'s IPO on March 2.

Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Could Break $1,000 If …;3/1/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAndroid, fromAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL), is the dominant mobile operating system. It runs on nearly nine of every 10 mobile phones, worldwide. But that's never really been a primary reason to by GOOGL stock … or at least not directly.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockFrom an investor standpoint, you would still rather buyApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) because Apple monetizes iOS the way a butcher monetizes a pig. Google, on the other hand, just gives its OS away to OEMs.That's not to say Google doesn't make any money off Android, though. Simply by offering its search engine and Google Play store through the software, GOOGL rakes in billions of dollars.But, the Android ecosystem is extremely fragmented. Compared toAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) - which runs its own store and hasits own browser and search engine- Google's take is a mere fraction.What if that changed? Would it mean anything to GOOGL stock holders?Controlling AndroidWhile Google is not yet charging OEMs to use its software, the company has been quietly trying to gain control of its creation. Management is pushing OEMs to deliver security updates on a monthly basis. This is important, as crooks push malware onto older, unpatched phones.7 Stocks That Will Hit All-Time Highs in 2017Google's newest handset, the Pixel, is designed to be as good as an iPhone. Reviews, however, have been mixed. The company is even trying to getback into Chinathrough its OEMs (the world's largest market tossed Google back in 2010 over censorship).Still, Google has its work cut out for itself.Samsung Electronic(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) dominates the Android market. OEMs and consumers see this fragmentation as an advantage, even though it allows bugs to multiply because they may appear on one device or brand only.The operating system itself is hopelessly fragmented. Google is only now rolling out its Marshmallow and Nougat versions of Android andstill developing the ""O"" version, while many users have devices that still run the KitKat version. My own Android phone runs on Lollipop, (simply because it lacks the storage to run anything newer).The way Google eventually gets its arms around all of this may be throughAndromeda, an operating system for both Android and its laptop Chromebook devices. Unifying software platforms would give Alphabet Inc the kind of power that Microsoft only dreamed of with its Windows operating system.Bottom Line on GOOGL StockIf Alphabetwereto start monetizing Android, would investors even notice?Alphabet continues to grow at 20% per year, powered by advertising on its main Search site and YouTube. The company brings approximately 25 cents of every dollar to the net income line, its balance sheet carries almost no debt, and operating cash flow is ridiculous ($36 billion last year alone, more than twice what it achieved just two years prior). In 2016, Alphabet had revenue in excess of $90 billion.Over the last year, the price of GOOGL stock is up nearly 17%, and the non-voting GOOG shares are up even more. The company's market cap of $577 billion trails only that of Apple. Six months ago,they were nearly level, but that was before Apple's recent run to new highs.Alphabet Inc CFO Ruth Porat's program of paring non-performing assets and forcing ""other bets"" (like the company's self-driving car unit, now called Waymo) to make it on their own has paid off. Google's investment balances have been growing steadily, along with its asset base.Why Apple Inc. (AAPL) Will Become a Trillion-Dollar CompanyWhat's most amazing is how Alphabet continues to underperform. Android is not a major profit center, and Google Cloud is often considered third in the market, behind Amazon and Microsoft. Google was late to the voice party with Google Assistant, which allowed Amazon to get the drop on it. Plus, the hardware line is loaded with ""me too"" products, and GOOGL leads in precisely zero categories.Still, Porat has performed well in providing discipline to Google executives, but she has not propelled Alphabet to market leadership outside of Search.If assets such as Android became true profit centers, GOOGL stock would be well on its way to $1,000 per share and becoming the first trillion-dollar company.Dana Blankenhornis a financial and technology journalist.

Dow Soars Above 21,000 on Trump Speech, Short Covering;3/1/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTheDow Jones Industrial Averagesurged more than 300 points to cross the 21,000 level for the first time ever on Wednesday, roaring back from Tuesday's minuscule decline that broke a record 12-in-a-row win streak.makeArticleAd();The exuberance is so thick in the air it's hard to breathe, with stock prices melting higher despite political uncertainty, hawkish noises from the Federal Reserve, extended valuations, narrow breadth and extreme sentiment. It's incredible to see.In the end, the Dow gained 1.5%, theS&P 500gained 1.4%, theNasdaq Compositegained 1.4% and theRussell 2000gained 1.9%. Treasury bonds weakened, the dollar was mostly stronger, gold lost 0.3% and oil lost 0.3% amid renewed focus on record crude inventories.Financial stocks - which have been the primary drivers of the post-election uptrend - gained 2.8%. yield-sensitive utilities and REITs were the laggards, down 1% and 0.4%, respectively.Weight Watchers International, Inc.(NYSE:WTW) surged 27.5% on a Q4 earnings beat thanks to a 9.7% jump in subscribers. Guidance was strong.Office Depot Inc(NASDAQ:ODP) soared 16.5% on solid results.Intel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) fell 0.8% after a downgrade from Bernstein analysts on concerns over data-center sales and high valuation. That boosted the March $35 INTC calls recommended toEdge Prosubscribers to a gain of 35%.Palo Alto Networks Inc(NYSE:PANW) fell 24.2% on weak results and guidance.5 Blue-Chip Stocks to Sell in MarchBest Buy Co Inc(NYSE:BBY) fell 4.5% on a fourth-quarter earnings beat, but unexpected comp-store sales decline and weak guidance. And HD/4k camera system makerAmbarella Inc(NASDAQ:AMBA) fell 4.4% on weak forward guidance on inventory overhand from big customerGoPro Inc(NASDAQ:GPRO).Stepping back, it's worth noting that the bulls keep changing the narrative, with the buying apparently being driven by a lack of specifics from President Trump's admittedly well-received speech to Congress last night (when just 24 hours ago, the warning was that stocks would be disappointed by a lack of specifics). Or that the last time the Dow had a 300 points rally was on Nov. 7, when FBI Director Comey cleared Hillary Clinton for the second time over her email server and thus lifted her electoral victory hopes.All that seems to matter these days is that stocks, no matter the reason, want to move higher. Even as earnings and GDP growth estimates deteriorate (as shown above). The primary motivator for today's move is a combination of first-of-the-month inflows as well as intense short covering near the open. This is an air pocket. A sugar high.Yet headwinds continue to build. And we are massively overdue for a normal pullback with the last 1% loss on the Dow back in October.Apple Inc. (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook Raises Hopes for a New Mac ProThe biggest of which is the increasingly hawkish tone from the Federal Reserve which has pushed up futures market odds of a March rate hike above 80%. Fed rate hikes will ultimately end this bull market, as they have ended all bull markets (and economic expansions) in recent history.

Apple Inc. (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook Raises Hopes for a New Mac Pro;3/1/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) has taken heat recently over what some see as an abandonment of its core, ""pro"" customers. With its focus seemingly on the iPhone and Apple Watch, AAPL's Mac computers were being left to fall behind. Especially those aimed at the creative professional market.makeArticleAd();Source: AppleApple CEO Tim Cook answered questions at a shareholder meeting yesterday and offered up comments that give hope those Macs will soon be getting attention. Cook's words even raised the hope that a new Mac Pro could eventually be released.Apple's Professional Mac Lineup Has Fallen BehindOver the last several years, AAPL hasfallen seriously behind in updating many of its Mac computers. Creative professionals and prosumers - considered Apple's core customers for Macs - have been especially hard hit.There has been no new Mac Pro in nearly 1,200 days. That's an incredible length of time to go without updating a workstation class computer that commands a starting price of $2,999. Prior to the current model, professionals who needed AAPL's most powerful PC for rendering, editing video and other tasks only waited one to two years between new Mac Pro releases.Apple released new versions every year between 2006 and 2010, then in 2012 and launched the current Mac Pro in 2013.The iMac, which has been a favorite of creative professionals as well as being popular with consumers, hasn't seen a refresh in over 500 days. A new iMac is long overdue.7 Stocks That Will Hit All-Time Highs in 2017There have been many excuses, including finger pointing atIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) over theavailability of new CPUs. Regardless of the real reason, the perception is that Apple has relegated the Mac lineup to the back burner, while it focuses on the incredibly profitable iPhone and launches new consumer products like the Apple Watch.In the meantime,Microsoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) has been going after AAPL's creative professional demographic. The company has expanded from tablets into PCs and last year, it launched theSurface Studio- an innovative all-in-one PC that has many longtime Mac users thinking hard about switching to Windows.Tim Cook Claims AAPL Is Still Focused on Professional CustomersAt an Apple shareholder meeting yesterday, CEO Time Cook fielded investor questions. He dismissed speculation of the Mac and iPad line-ups converging, making the point that a tablet could never be a Mac replacement. He then spoke about AAPL's focus on its professional customers. Quoted inMacRumors,Cook's comments included:""You will see us do more in the pro area … The pro area is very important to us. The creative area is very important to us in particular.""When asked if the apparent lack of new releases aimed at creative professionals means Apple has become too consumer focused, he replied:""Don't think something we've done or something that we're doing that isn't visible yet is a signal that our priorities are elsewhere.""He didn't say specifically that a new Mac Pro or a new iMac are coming, but his comments give hope that these might be in the pipeline.What AppleHasDone for Its Creative ProfessionalsWhile the lack of a new Mac Pro and new iMac are hurting Apple's reputation for being the go-to platform for creative professionals, the company has taken several steps to address the issue.What Is Apple Inc. Doing With Its iPhone 8 Lightning Port?It released the iPad Pro in 2015 and has since expanded its lineup of tablets aimed at creative professionals and prosumers. And last fall, it released an all-new MacBook Pro - a favorite laptop among that demographic. The MacBook Pro launchdidn't go as smoothly as planned, but did send the message that AAPL hasn't abandoned its core users. They may just have to get used to waiting a little longer between new models.With the iPad Pro established and the new MacBook Pro on store shelves, next on the wish list for many Apple fans are a new iMac and a new Mac Pro. The latter in particular seemed in danger of being discontinued altogether, but Tim Cook's comments have helped give hope that it could still be on AAPL's ""to do"" list.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceApple Inc.

New Feature Announcement: The User Manuals;3/1/2017;"As we ring in March 2017, we are pleased to announce a new feature on GuruFocus, the User Manuals. Like cooking recipes, these user manuals give detailed instructions on how to use our most popular features on the website.Throughout the past few years, GuruFocus introduced several new features for our Premium and Premium Plus members, including customized series inInteractive Charts, custom filters and screeners, backtesting, theDCF Fair Value Calculator,personalized guru lists, theAll-in-one Guru Screenerand backtesting, My Portfolios, GuruFocus in Excel and the Application Programming Interface (API). This article will briefly discuss each of the above features and give links to the respective user manuals.Interactive ChartsmakeArticleAd();As discussed in a previous article, the Interactive Charts feature allows you to generate visual diagrams that graph the trendline of the data. You can also create Peter Lynch charts, price-sales valuation charts and other customized charts to find good value opportunities. For example, consider the Peter Lynch Chart (Figure 1) and price-sales valuation chart (Figure 2) forWal-Mart Stores Inc.(WMT).Figure 1Figure 2As illustrated in Figure 1, Wal-Mart trades slightly above its Peter Lynch earnings line. Although this suggests Wal-Mart is slightly overvalued, the price-earnings ratio usually gives inaccurate results for cyclical companies as Peter Lynch observed during his investing career. The price-sales ratio, on the other hand, gives more accurate valuations as companies' profit margins tend to revert to the mean over time. Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio) measures the total market valuation using the P/S ratio for the entire market, i.e., the ratio of the Wilshire 5000 full-cap index to the U.S. gross domestic product.While Wal-Mart is slightly overvalued based on its Peter Lynch chart, the discount store is moderately undervalued based on its price-sales valuation chart as Figure 2 illustrates. This suggests Wal-Mart has good value potential in the short term despite having declining operating margins.For more information on constructing detailed visuals, please consult the Interactive Charts User Manual.Discounted Cash Flow CalculatorLike Interactive Charts, which identify the ""entry points"" (times to buy) and the ""exit points"" (time to sell) for a company stock, the Discounted Cash Flow Calculator determines if the company is trading above or below its intrinsic value based on the following parameters: earnings per share, the 10-year EPS with nonrecurring items growth rate, the terminal growth rate, the number of terminal growth years and the discount rate. Figure 3 shows a sample DCF Calculator page forApple Inc.(AAPL).Figure 3Please consult the DCF user manual for details on how to use our fair value calculator and how to interpret the fair value results.Personalized Guru List / Aggregated PortfolioOur company focuses on the actions of investment gurus, hence the name GuruFocus. You can view stock ideas from well-known investors like Bill Ackman (Trades, Portfolio), Carl Icahn (Trades, Portfolio), George Soros (Trades, Portfolio) and David Tepper (Trades, Portfolio) on our Latest Guru Stocks and Real-time Stock Trades Web pages.One powerful feature of guru stock ideas is the Aggregated Portfolio of Gurus. After you generate a personalized list of gurus, you can track the combined portfolio to see which companies have high guru ownership. We constructed two models based on the aggregated portfolio of Premium gurus, the Most Weighted Portfolio and the Most Broadly Held Portfolio. These two model portfolios have outperformed the Standard & Poor's 500 index benchmark in at least seven of the past 10 years.We also offer stock ideas from insiders, which include C-level employees and directors. For example, you can view insider cluster buys, guru and insider double buys and triple buys. For more information on how to get stock ideas, please consult our user manual on guru stock ideas.All-in One Guru ScreenerOne of our most popular features, the All-in-One Guru Screener allows you to screen for company stocks that meet select criteria. As discussed in the user manual, the Screener offers over 150 predefined filters and the ability to create customized filters. Unlike other value screeners, the All-in-One Screener allows you to save custom screens and backtest the test portfolio against the benchmarks.My PortfoliosWe have several user-friendly features on our website, including the My Portfolios feature that allows you to track the daily performance of your portfolio against the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average benchmark. You can also set email alerts when stocks in your portfolio reach a target price, price-earnings ratio, etc. or a daily update report.During the past few weeks, GuruFocus launched a new, user-friendly home page that contains snapshots of each of your portfolios in the left column. To access an individual portfolio, click on the ""View/Edit Portfolio"" button in the lower-right corner of the desired portfolio. Please consult the My Portfolios user manual for detailed instructions on how to set up portfolios and email alerts.GuruFocus Excel Add-in and APIWe also have features for our Excel and advanced programming members, the Excel Add-in and the Application Programming Interface (API). These features allow you to retrieve data from our database and construct personalized templates. The Excel Add-in offers an eclectic variety of features, including the new user-defined GURUF function that allows you to retrieve the data more efficiently. For complete details on our advanced Excel and API features, please consult the Excel / API user manual.Some closing commentsMost of the above features, including customized Interactive Chart series, value screeners, portfolio performances, Excel Add-in and API, require a GuruFocus Premium membership.

'Diamonds' ETF Shines Bright: 3 Ways To Play The Dow Renaissance;3/1/2017;"The Dow Jones Industrial Average has had quite the turn in the spotlight of late, breaching the 20,000 level for the first time in its 120-year history and then stringing 12 straight record closes for its longest winning streak in decades.This hot streak for the blue chip index, and the exchange traded funds that track it, came as investors cheered President Donald Trump's proposals to deregulate industries, cut taxes and boost infrastructure spending.makeArticleAd();Relative to the S&P 500, the Dow has far more exposure to industrials, financials and consumer discretionary - economically sensitive sectors that could disproportionately benefit from the Trump vision - and zero exposure to defensively oriented utilities and real estate, points out Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF research at CFRA Research.On Wednesday, following Trump's well-receivedmaiden speech to Congress, SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA) soared to a fresh all-time high powered by big jumps forApple(AAPL),Goldman Sachs(GS) andJPMorgan Chase(JPM).[ibdchart symbol=""dia"" type=""daily"" size=""quarter"" position=""leftchart"" ]""The optimism following the (Trump) speech, as well as increased confidence that the Fed is going to raise rates sooner, is driving more cyclical stocks and sectors,"" said Rosenbluth.

Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Just Succeeded Where Apple Inc. (AAPL) Failed;3/1/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL) isn't exactly a direct competitor toApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL), but the former just eclipsed the latter, and seemingly out of nowhere.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');Source: GoogleOne of the worst-kept secrets in the industry has been Apple's determination to get into the TV business. The company has been working for years trying to put together an online TV service, hoping to offer 25 channels for between $30 and $40 monthly. That project seemed to have been put on hold when AAPL and broadcasters couldn't reach an agreement on price.But Alphabet has just succeeded where Apple failed.YouTube TV - live TV from over 40 providers including the big networks for $35 per month - is now official.YouTube TV Takes on CableYouTube TVwas announced on Tuesday. Launching ""soon"" in the U.S., this is Google's skinny TV bundle for cord cutters. The four major networks are onboard. So isWalt Disney Co's(NYSE:DIS) ESPN, along with regional sports networks. Google is also including some content from its premium YouTube Red service. All told, there will be over 40 different content providers - not bad for $35 per month.Subscribers get unlimited cloud DVR storage, search powered by Google's AI, six user accounts (three streams can be active simultaneously) and the ability to watch YouTube TV on a variety of devices including smartphones, tablets, PCs and Google Chromecast.Why Apple Inc. (AAPL) Will Become a Trillion-Dollar CompanyIn other word, this is pretty much what Apple has been struggling to release.YouTubeTV is Eerily Similar to Apple's Television PlansApple has to have been watching Google's YouTube TV announcement with dismay. Its rival beat it to the punch with the streaming TV bundle it had envisioned offering with the Apple TV.What makes it even more galling is how close YouTube TV is to what AAPL was negotiating.In May 2015, AAPL andCBS Corporation(NYSE:CBS) were in talks about a subscription Apple television streaming service, butmoney was reportedly a sticking point. In December of that year, CBS CEO Les Moonves confirmed toBusiness Insiderthat his network had been in talks with Apple, and were close to settling on a monthly price to charge consumers. Moonves was throwing around $35 - exactly the price that YouTube TV is charging.Apple balked. Apparently Google was waiting in the wings.Where Does This Leave AAPL and Its TV Strategy?At this point, Apple's entire television strategy seems to be struggling.There was hope that the new Apple TV that launched in 2015 would come with a streaming TV bundle. That didn't happen. Now Apple's set-top streamer is suffering from disappointing sales. The box costs twice what Google andAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) charge for their streamers, but lacks the 4K support rivals offer.Last year, AAPL was showing off anew TV appthat would serve as a hub for streaming content, tracking use across multiple services and devices. But it failed to get buy-in fromNetflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX), making its usefulness questionable.Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Could Break $1,000 If ...Google's YouTube TV launch is the icing on the cake.Where Can Apple Go From Here?Don't expect Apple to give up on its plans, of course.The signs of a renewed push toward taking over your living room began last month. Applehired the former head of Amazon's Fire TVto take over as the head of marketing for Apple TV. This move has raised expectations that AAPL will revamp its Apple TV hardware. It also freed up the previous head of Apple TV to helplead Apple's efforts to sign content deals- something he had considerable experience in from his previous role as senior VP of content distribution atHulu.While YouTube TV offers a fixed content bundle, AAPL had always pushed for subscribers having an option to choose their own bundle, Moonves says. If the company can accomplish that goal, it still can position an Apple television streaming service as being something unique.With YouTube TV, Google may have beaten Apple to the punch when it comes to being first of the tech giants to offer a cheap way to cut the cable, but the war is likely just beginning.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceWhat Is Apple Inc.

Berkshire Hathaway: Repurchase Limit Crosses $135 Per Share;3/1/2017;"In addition to the release ofWarren Buffett(Trades,Portfolio)'s shareholder letter this past weekend,Berkshire Hathaway(BRK.A) (BRK.B) reported full-year fiscal 2016 financial results as well - so let's dive in.Berkshire reported $24 billion in net income in 2016, comparable to 2015. On 2.466 billion equivalent B shares, that's equal to roughly $9.75 per share in 2016 reported earnings.I personally make a few adjustments to try and normalize these results. First, I largely back out the roughly $6.7 billion in investment and derivatives gains included in net income (replaced by roughly $2.3 billion in income, which is equal to ~50% of the trailing five-year average). Second, I add back unreported earnings from the ""Big Five"" -The Coca-Cola Co.(KO),American Express(AXP),Wells Fargo(WFC),IBM(IBM) andApple(AAPL); by my math, there was roughly $3.1 billion (aftertax) in unreported earnings from these five holdings (the Apple stake is adjusted to reflect the disclosures Buffett made Monday morning on CNBC). Finally, I make a few other adjustments that I believe are reasonable (most notably an estimate of earnings power on the excess cash Berkshire holds and higher depreciation expense at BNSF to account for the real maintenance cost attributable to the railroad). All in, my math estimates that Berkshire Hathaway's normalized earnings power is approaching $10 per B share.makeArticleAd();For the full year, Berkshire generated $32.5 billion in cash flow from operations (a decade ago that number was ~$10 billion). Roughly $13 billion was reinvested in the business as capital expenditures with $5.1 billion and $3.8 billion spent at Berkshire Hathaway Energy and Burlington Northern Santa Fe. Another $31.4 billion was spent on acquisitions (largelyPrecision Castparts[PCP] but also $1.4 billion for bolt-on acquisitions). The net shortfall from these three buckets (roughly $12 billion) was covered by incremental long-term debt issued at low single-digit interest rates.Insurance businessesBerkshire's insurance businesses reported a pretax underwriting gain of ~$2.1 billion in 2016, an increase of 16% from 2015. The gain was attributable to Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group, where underwriting income nearly doubled, to $822 million. Within BHRG, ""Retroactive Reinsurance"" losses declined from $469 million to $49 million. It's difficult to say anything meaningful based on headline changes in the reported reinsurance results from year to year. As an example, the retroactive reinsurance agreement recently signed withAmerican International Group(AIG) - for which Berkshire received a premium of $10 billion- will generate $375 million in pretax deferred charge amortization losses for BHRG in 2017. Focusing only on the losses without considering the economics of the whole deal leads you to faulty conclusions.GEICO had another solid year of growth in 2016, with earned premiums up 12%. For the year, GEICO added nearly 1 million net auto policies in force (PIFs), compared to a net 700,000 additions in 2015. While the loss ratio increased in 2016, pressuring profits, this is a reasonable trade-off in the short term (it's worth noting that storm-related losses at GEICO increased by $260 million in 2016 as well). GEICO has a sustainable competitive advantage that becomes more powerful in an environment where consumers are increasingly cost conscious. Management has proven adept at managing the business for the long-term. GEICO will emerge from the industry's current challenges in a stronger position than it started.Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group continues to report solid numbers as well, with earned premiums increasing to $6.3 billion in 2016 (up more than 40% from 2014). The combined ratio was just shy of 90%, resulting in more than $650 million in pretax underwriting income.At the end of 2016, the float attributable to Berkshire's insurance businesses exceeded $91 billion (compared to $70 billion five years). Inclusive of the AIG deal discussed a moment ago, Berkshire's float exceeds $100 billion. In his letter, Buffett restated his belief that a decline in float, should it occur, will be very gradual - ""at the outside no more than 3% per year.""Noninsurance businesses2016 was a tough year for rails generally and BNSF specifically, with revenues falling 10% on comparable declines in volumes and average revenue per car. The coal business took a beating in 2016, with volumes and revenues down 21% and 27%, respectively; even after declining by more than one-quarter, the coal business still accounted for ~17% of BNSF's revenues in 2016. The operating ratio increased in the face of sliding revenues (meaning lower operating margins), resulting in a 16% drop in earnings. 2016 was undoubtedly a struggle for BNSF; if guidance fromUnion Pacific(UNP) is any indication, 2017 should be a step in the right direction.Berkshire Hathaway Energy reported $17.9 billion in 2016 revenues, a low single-digit decline from 2015. A small increase in pretax income ended up as a 7% increase in aftertax profits, partly attributable to a lower effective tax rate (down two points to 14%). There's plenty of room to run here: my research suggests production tax credits from wind-powered electricity generation will be a material tailwind to BHE's net income over the coming years (MidAmerican owns more wind-powered capacity than any other rate-regulated electric utility in the country).Berkshire's Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (MSR) businesses reported ~$5.6 billion in earnings in 2016, an increase of ~$1 billion versus the prior year (both measures exclude amortization of intangibles). The entirety of the gains came from the Manufacturing bucket due to the inclusion of Precision Castparts; pretax Manufacturing earnings declined in 2016 whenPrecision Castparts is backed out (largely due to a $365 million loss from the disposition of part of Lubrizol's business in the fourth quarter). MSR was also impacted by other one-time costs, such as $110 million in acquisition/integration and transition costs from the Duracell deal.Finally, Finance & Financial Products revenues increased 10% in 2016, with earnings up 4%. Clayton Homes' reported a solid year, selling more than 42,000 units (an impressive 25% increase from 2015). Strength in manufactured homes from Clayton offset less impressive results in the remainder of the business (notably at Marmon).ConclusionBook value increased by ~11% in 2016 to $115 per B share (trailing three-year CAGR of 8%). The repurchase authorization (up to 120% of book value) enables Buffett to buy back stock at ~$138 per B share. As he noted in the shareholder letter, ""purchases at that level clearly bring an instant and material benefit to continuing shareholders"". Starting at ~$170 per share, that would require a pullback of ~20%. Shares are reasonably valued at current levels.Berkshire's fortress balance sheet continues to offer significant optionality; at some unknown point in the future, it will be used to create meaningful per-share value for investors. My favorite quote from Bufett's shareholder letter addressed this in a roundabout way:""Every decade or so, dark clouds will fill the economic skies, and they will briefly rain gold. When downpours of that sort occur, it's imperative that we rush outdoors carrying washtubs, not teaspoons. And that we will do.""Disclosure:Long BRK.B, IBM and Union Pacific.Start a free seven-day trial of Premium Membership to GuruFocus.Premium MembersThis article first appeared onGuruFocus."

5 Best Performing Stocks of February;3/1/2017;"Markets set a blistering set of gains over the month with new milestones being created on a regular basis. Over the month increasingly evident that President Trump's policy proposals have gone down extremely well with investors. Additionally, economic data continued to be largely encouraging while earnings numbers have been impressive, lending a firm basis to the long-running market rally.February's PerformanceFor the month, the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq rose 4.8%, 3.7% and 3.8%, respectively after President Trump vowed to bring back millions of jobs to the U.S. Additionally, optimism over Trump's proposed market-friendly policies including tax cuts, financial de-regulation and increase in infrastructure spending benefitted all the three key indexes. Fed's positive view of the economy and rally inoil pricesas well as upbeat earnings reports also boosted investor sentiment.Encouraging Domestic DataMost of the economic reports released during the month were encouraging in nature. The ISM manufacturing index increased while the services index declined only marginally for the month of January. Retail sales increased 0.4%, following an upwardly revised 1% gain for December. Durable orders rebounded in January, increasing by 1.8%. The Leading Indicators Index gained 0.6% following an increase of 0.5% in December.CPI and PPI both moved up 0.6% in January. Construction spending increased by 0.2% in December. However, a few key reports were negative in nature. Industrial production declined 0.3% following a downwardly revised 0.6% increase for December. While durable orders fell by 0.4%, consumer confidence dropped to 111.8.Q4 GDP's Second Estimate SlipsAccording to the ""second"" estimate by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, fourth quarter output of goods and services increased at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.9% from the previous three months. This was lower than the consensus estimate of 2.1% growth. An increase in the foreign-trade deficit weighed on growth during the final three months of 2016. In the fourth quarter, exports fell 4% while imports rose 8.5%.Business investment fell lower, with spending on equipment decreasing 1.9%. Residential construction investment increased 9.6%, revised downward from an initial estimate of a 10.2% gain. However, strong gains in consumer spending had a positive impact on the domestic economy. Consumers, the torchbearers for the U.S. economy, increased spending by a solid 3%Housing Sector Recovery SlowsMost of the reports released across the month suggest that the housing sector's recovery has slowed down. Housing starts declined by 2.6% in January though building permits increased by 4.6%. The National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) Housing Market Index declined from 67 to 65 in February.In contrast, existing homes sales jumped 3.3% in January to a seasonally adjusted rate of 5.69 million, the highest level recorded in 10 years. New home sales increased 3.7% to a seasonally adjusted rate of 555,000. However, the pending home sales index declined 2.8% in January to 106.4, the lowest level in a year. The current scenario seems to be a consequence of demand outstripping supply and a sharp increase in home prices.Job Additions Rise, Increase in Hourly Earnings   DipThe U.S. added 227,000 jobs in January, higher than the consensus estimate of 174,000 job additions. This figure also exceeds December's reading of 157,000. These are the best monthly job gains since September.However, expectations that the economy is moving towards a full employment scenario weighed on workers' pay, with average hourly wages rising only 0.1% in January, lower than December's downwardly revised gain of 0.2%. Further, the unemployment rate, meantime, ticked up to 4.8% from 4.7% in January.Record Earnings Growth in Fourth QuarterThe absolute earnings total for the quarter is on track to be the highest ever. The bulk of the Q4 earnings season is now behind us, with results from only a few of S&P 500 members still awaited. As of February 17, 2017, Q4 results from 411 S&P 500 members, or 82.2% of the index's total membership had been released. Total earnings for these 411 index members are up +8% on +4.9% higher revenues, with 68.9% beating EPS estimates and 54.7% coming ahead of top-line expectations. (Read:Retail in Focus as Q4 Earnings Season Winds Down)Retail earnings grabbed the spotlight last month. Solid fourth-quarter reports from Wal-MartWMT, Macy'sM, and Home DepotHDprovided a major fillip to investor sentiment. Earlier in the month, Apple Inc.'sAAPLfirst quarter fiscal results easily topped expectations. The good show was driven by impressive sales of Apple's latest smartphone model iPhone 7 and 7 Plus.Investors Ride ""Trump Rally""The euphoria surrounding President Donald Trump's proposed market-friendly policies including the prospect of massive tax cuts and an uptick in infrastructure spending propelled markets to new highs in February. The Dow closed at an all-time high for a twelfth straight session on Feb 27, posting its longest such streak since 1987. Both the blue-chip index and S&P 500 settled at all-time high levels, while the Nasdaq closed a few points short of a record. At present, the blue-chip index continues to hover above the psychological milestone of 20,000.Trump's polices including tax cuts, repealing regulations and pickup in infrastructure outlays restored expectations of a pro-growth agenda that helped the Dow push further into record territory. Trump is also planning a multi-trillion-dollar tax cut that will boost the U.S. economy and lift corporate profits.Deregulation Ensues, Defense Spending to RiseTrump has also signed an executive order designed to scale back the Dodd-Frank Act. He views the Dodd-Frank regulatory overhaul as a harsh measure, especially, on banks as they had to beef up compliance compartments to deal with a list of new rules.Meanwhile, Trump sent both the political parties a notice on Feb 27 stating that he intends to significantly raise defense related outlay. He will seek a $54 billion hike in spending on tanks, ships and weapon systems and will trim other priorities. The defense budget will climb 10%, according to the White House, while Trump recommended $30 billion in supplementary military spending for this yearMaiden Speech to CongressUltimately, the Dow snapped its record streak of gains ahead of Trump's first speech before a joint session of Congress on the last day of the month. Profit taking ensued due to a lack of details about Trump's policies.During his speech, Trump adopted a measured approach to several contentious issues. However, he reiterated his commitment to immigration reform and replacing Obamacare with a new healthcare law. At the same time, the speech was light on details but for a request that Congress pass his trillion dollar infrastructure plan.FOMC MinutesMinutes from the Federal Reserve's January meeting adopted a similar tone, keeping alive prospects of a potential near-term interest rate hike. The minutes said that ""many participants expressed the view that it might be appropriate to raise the federal funds rate again fairly soon if incoming information on the labor market and inflation was in line with or stronger than their current expectations or if the risks of overshooting the committee's maximum-employment and inflation objectives increased.""Fed Chair Janet Yellen expects a gradual rate increase amid a modestly expanding economy and inflation that should touch the Fed's desired target rate of 2% in the near term. She said that ""at our upcoming meetings, the Fed will evaluate whether employment and inflation are continuing to evolve in line with…expectations, in which case a further adjustment of the federal funds rate would likely be appropriate.""5 Star Performers for FebruaryI ran a screen onResearch Wizardfor companies with the following parameters:(Click here to sign up for a free trial to the Research Wizard today):Percentage price change over the last 4 weeks greater than or   equal to 15% (As of Oct 31, 2016)Forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) for the current   financial year (F1) less than or equal to 20.

The likelihood of a rate hike in March has increased significantly after the central bank and Janet Yellen herself made statements to that effect. Trading also remains mostly range bound in nature.However, several market watchers now believe the absence of volatility is a sign that the rally is being powered by fundamentals instead of pure sentiment. An improving economy and strong earnings numbers lend further weight to such a proposition. The catalysts for the current rally are still firmly in place and likely to power further gains in the days ahead.Everything You Need to Know About Snapchat BEFORE It Goes   PublicYou may be curious about the buzz surrounding Snap Inc.'s IPO on March 2.

Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Could Break $1,000 If …;3/1/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAndroid, fromAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL), is the dominant mobile operating system. It runs on nearly nine of every 10 mobile phones, worldwide. But that's never really been a primary reason to by GOOGL stock … or at least not directly.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockFrom an investor standpoint, you would still rather buyApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) because Apple monetizes iOS the way a butcher monetizes a pig. Google, on the other hand, just gives its OS away to OEMs.That's not to say Google doesn't make any money off Android, though. Simply by offering its search engine and Google Play store through the software, GOOGL rakes in billions of dollars.But, the Android ecosystem is extremely fragmented. Compared toAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) - which runs its own store and hasits own browser and search engine- Google's take is a mere fraction.What if that changed? Would it mean anything to GOOGL stock holders?Controlling AndroidWhile Google is not yet charging OEMs to use its software, the company has been quietly trying to gain control of its creation. Management is pushing OEMs to deliver security updates on a monthly basis. This is important, as crooks push malware onto older, unpatched phones.7 Stocks That Will Hit All-Time Highs in 2017Google's newest handset, the Pixel, is designed to be as good as an iPhone. Reviews, however, have been mixed. The company is even trying to getback into Chinathrough its OEMs (the world's largest market tossed Google back in 2010 over censorship).Still, Google has its work cut out for itself.Samsung Electronic(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) dominates the Android market. OEMs and consumers see this fragmentation as an advantage, even though it allows bugs to multiply because they may appear on one device or brand only.The operating system itself is hopelessly fragmented. Google is only now rolling out its Marshmallow and Nougat versions of Android andstill developing the ""O"" version, while many users have devices that still run the KitKat version. My own Android phone runs on Lollipop, (simply because it lacks the storage to run anything newer).The way Google eventually gets its arms around all of this may be throughAndromeda, an operating system for both Android and its laptop Chromebook devices. Unifying software platforms would give Alphabet Inc the kind of power that Microsoft only dreamed of with its Windows operating system.Bottom Line on GOOGL StockIf Alphabetwereto start monetizing Android, would investors even notice?Alphabet continues to grow at 20% per year, powered by advertising on its main Search site and YouTube. The company brings approximately 25 cents of every dollar to the net income line, its balance sheet carries almost no debt, and operating cash flow is ridiculous ($36 billion last year alone, more than twice what it achieved just two years prior). In 2016, Alphabet had revenue in excess of $90 billion.Over the last year, the price of GOOGL stock is up nearly 17%, and the non-voting GOOG shares are up even more. The company's market cap of $577 billion trails only that of Apple. Six months ago,they were nearly level, but that was before Apple's recent run to new highs.Alphabet Inc CFO Ruth Porat's program of paring non-performing assets and forcing ""other bets"" (like the company's self-driving car unit, now called Waymo) to make it on their own has paid off. Google's investment balances have been growing steadily, along with its asset base.Why Apple Inc. (AAPL) Will Become a Trillion-Dollar CompanyWhat's most amazing is how Alphabet continues to underperform. Android is not a major profit center, and Google Cloud is often considered third in the market, behind Amazon and Microsoft. Google was late to the voice party with Google Assistant, which allowed Amazon to get the drop on it. Plus, the hardware line is loaded with ""me too"" products, and GOOGL leads in precisely zero categories.Still, Porat has performed well in providing discipline to Google executives, but she has not propelled Alphabet to market leadership outside of Search.If assets such as Android became true profit centers, GOOGL stock would be well on its way to $1,000 per share and becoming the first trillion-dollar company.Dana Blankenhornis a financial and technology journalist.

Apple May Not Want to Own Netflix, But It May Go After an Oscar;3/1/2017;"As Apple (AAPL) slowly moves into original video content with a couple of shows, there's been a lot of speculation among investors and the media that it should just buy Netflix and be done with it.While that may happen much furtherdown the line, Apple seems less likely about going after what Netflix is and more about what it has -- an Oscar.Former Piper Jaffray analyst turned venture capitalist Gene Munster believes Apple will win an Oscar relatively soon, perhaps in the next five years.makeArticleAd();""We think Apple will win an Oscar in the next five years,"" Munster's firm, Loup Ventures wroterecently. ""That’s how long it will take for Apple to scale its original content spend from less than $200 [million] today to $5-7 [billion].""Netflix (NFLX) just won the first Oscar in company history forThe White Helmets, a documentary about civilian first responder in Syria. Along with Amazon (which also won a few statues), Netflix is serious about changing how people watch and consume media.Apple seems intent on doing that too, with Apple Music, though at a different level.Apple is taking the slow route to original video content and is more likely to do what it did with Apple Music, buying a small company and partnering with creative geniuses (Jimmy Iovine and Dr. Dre) than buying a big company like Netflix. It's already started to do that with James Corden, buyingCarpool Karaokefor Apple Music and partnering with producer Ben Silverman to bringPlanet of the Apps, a reality show about app developers, to Apple Music.The Financial Timesreportedit had looked at buying Ron Howard and Brian Grazer's Imagine Entertainment, but talks stalled. This is another example of Apple wanting to partner with titans of industry who can help shape the way consumers experience as opposed to buying a creative disruptor itself.The Wall Street Journalhasreportedthat Apple wants to make TV shows akin in quality toGame of Thronesfor its Apple Music service. It's a natural extension that down the line, Apple would want to make similar quality movies available for its Apple Music subscribers as well, despite what Apple media czar Eddy Cue sayspublicly. (Remember, Apple is famous for eschewing something in public until it can make it better for its users).No matter who Apple winds up partnering with down the line for video content, it's Apple's goal to remain culturally relevant. Cue hasreferenced MTVas a jumping off point for Apple Music, making the cultural relevant mission all the more relevant.Investors shouldn't expect a Netflix-sized acquisition down the line, but don't be caught off guard when Apple Films is up for an Oscar next decade."

Stock Market News for March 01, 2017;3/1/2017;"Benchmarks finished in the red on the last trading day of February as investors waited eagerly for President Trump's speech on Tuesday night. Dow closed in negative territory snapping its winning run of twelfth consecutive session gains, the longest such streak since 1987. Additionally, growth in the U.S economy remained unchanged in the fourth quarter after higher trade deficit offset gains from rising consumer spending.

Residential construction investment increased 9.6%, revised downward from an initial estimate of a 10.2% gain.

3 Reasons Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock Has Plenty More Upside;3/1/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsNot long ago,Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMD) was considered a has-been. But of course, the rumors of the company's death have been, well, greatly exaggerated. Consider that AMD stock has skyrocketed 600% during the past 12 months.makeArticleAd();Source:Matthew Rutledge via FlickrNow the company is suddenly part of the hot crowd of chip operators, such asNvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA). In fact, AMD stock was able to outpace the company. After all, for the past year, NVDA stock has logged a gain of 220%.OK, so what can we expect with AMD stock going forward? Can it sustain the gains?I think so. Granted, the returns will probably not necessarily be in the triple digits. What's more, you should expect quite a bit of volatility.But for the most part, AMD stock still should catch lots of fire. Let's see why:Reason No. 1 for AMD Stock: LeadershipWhen it comes to the technology world, it's critical that the CEO have the right blend of technical skills and business acumen. Just look at Steve Jobs atApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) orFacebook Inc's(NASDAQ:FB) Mark Zuckerberg.7 Stocks That Will Hit All-Time Highs in 2017So as for the case of Advanced Micro Devices, it looks like the company has a CEO who fits the bill: Lisa Su. Since taking the helm a couple years, she has been impeccable with her strategic moves and strong focus on disciplined execution.But then again, she has the right background to lead a company like AMD. Sheholdsa bachelor's, master's and doctorate degrees in electrical engineering from MIT. Oh, and she has authored over 40 technical papers. Yet along the way, Su has served at executive-level positions at companies likeFreescale Semiconductor Ltd(NYSE:FSL) andInternational Business Machines Corp.(NYSE:IBM).Reason No. 2 for AMD Stock: Product InnovationUntil recently, the phrase ""product innovation"" and Advanced Micro Devices were usually not used in the same sentence! The company usually had a vague product strategy and seemed more concerned about focusing on niche markets.But all this has changed - and fast. For this year, AMD plans to launch three major product lines - all of which are targeting major market opportunities. Now, the details are a bit vague, but it does look like AMD will have standout offerings that should move the needle in terms of revenues and profits.Consider that this week, AMD will officially launch three Ryzen chips for gaming systems. And for the highest performing one, the price tag will behalf-off comparedto a comparable chip from rivalIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC). Seems like a no-brainer that this will gin up lots of demand, right?Definitely.But the real traction is likely to come from the Naples line of chips, which will focus on the datacenter. Keep in mind that AMD has less than 1% of the market. In other words, there is tremendous potential for upside.The good news is that Naples is also likely to have strong performance - in terms of speed and power efficiency - relative to INTC, which currently has much of the marketshare for the datacenter.In light of the continued growth in cloud computing, there is likely to be plenty of demand for an alternative technology. Note that already, AMD has landed customers likeAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) andAlibaba Group Holding Ltd(NYSE:BABA), whichhosts35% of the websites in China.Finally, AMD plans to release a chip called Vega, which leverages GPU technology for cutting-edge categories like deep learning and AI (Artificial Intelligence). No doubt, this will mean encroaching on the turf of NVDA. Again, as with the server market, there will likely be many potential customers that would consider an alternative, especially if the pricing is right.Reason No. 3 for AMD Stock: MomentumTrue, it appears that much about AMD stock hinges on its product releases. And of course, these are far from guaranteed. Let's face it, for a mid-size company like AMD, it will not be easy to manage the complexities of multiple offerings.But it is important to note that the company has already shown an ability to execute - such as by beating Wall Street expectations. Take a look at the latestquarter. AMD posted revenues of $1.11 billion, up 15.4%. This was $40 million higher than the consensus forecast.Why Apple Inc. (AAPL) Will Become a Trillion-Dollar CompanyThe guidance was also encouraging. AMD put out a forecast of revenues to range from $955 million to $1.02 billion. This not only beat the analysts' projection of $964 but also implies an 18% growth rate, assuming that the real number comes in at the mid-point.But of course, for the rest of the year AMD will continue to launch products at a torrid pace. So all in all, there will be many potential catalysts to keep up the momentum. More importantly, the company will be focused on some of the hottest categories of technology, which should mean quite a bit of buzz to pump up the valuation even more.Tom Taulli runs the InvestorPlace blogIPO Playbookand is the author of various books, includingTaxes 2017: Saving A Bundle.Follow him on Twitter at@ttaulli.

Best Buy Inc Co (BBY) Stock Dives Into the Retail Dumpster;3/1/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBest Buy(NYSE:BBY) announced slightly lower same-store sales during the holiday season, and investors dumped BBY stock in a hurry.makeArticleAd();Source:Austin Kirk via FlickrThe drop was minor, less than 1%. But it was unexpected, and missed analyst estimates of a top-line gain of 0.5%.For the quarter, Best Buy reported earnings of $607 million ($1.91 per share) on revenue of $13.48 billion. This compared with earnings of just $479 million ($1.40) but revenue of $13.62 billion a year earlier. More importantly, while adjusted profits of $1.95 per share easily beat estimates of $1.67, revenues fell short of analysts' expectations, also for $13.62 billion.The revenue shortfall meant analysts threw Best Buy stock into the dumpster with retailers such asMacy's Inc.(NYSE:M), with shares down almost 5% early Wednesday, to $42.40. During the Christmas season, on Dec. 8, the shares traded as high as $49.31.Were the analysts right, or did they just offer smart investors a bargain? IsAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) about to kill all retailers, or is this just a case of Moore's Law in action?Great Expectations for Best BuyBest Buy even trounced the higher earnings whisper number of $1.66 per share. But actual estimateswere all over the map, with some very bearish about the company's ability to cut costs and others bullish on margins.7 Stocks That Will Hit All-Time Highs in 2017The Zacks Metric Model noted that BBY stock had beaten estimates for four quarters, and that shareholders had been rewarded with a 36% gain. In particular, Best Buy was posting big gains in online sales - the so-called ""omni-channel"" approach - and Zacks was expecting an upside surprise.On the bottom line, of course, Best Buy delivered one. And considering the sizable beat, BBY shares should've rocketed higher.But something else is at play … and that something is Moore's Law.Moore's Law Hits the Top LineMoore's Law, which turned 50 in 2015, was described byIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) co-founder Gordon Moore as an expected increase in circuit density on silicon, doubling every 18 months ago as far as he could see, in 1966.But, as I have been writing for many years now, Moore's Law alsoturned traditional economics on its head. Moore's Law is deflationary, and the deflationary impact grows with time, as integrated circuits are incorporated into more and more things, and as the impact is compounded by its use in various ways.In the case of Best Buy, this means the products it sells lose value as soon as they leave the factory, and the retailer is under enormous pressure to get them out the door before their value disappears. This isn't new, but in 2016 it hit one of the company's primary growth sectors: big-screen TVs.A TV that would have been unaffordable just a few years ago - 5 feet wide on the diagonal - is now available at Best Buy forjust $600. More important, flat-screen sets just don't break. I still have one from 2001.Could Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Take a Hint From Best Buy Co Inc (BBY)?Best Buy still makes money on that 60-inch set, but the price point is lower, and this is true for all consumer electronics. Whole categories that used to represent big profits, like back-up drives, DVD players and packaged software, have disappeared as consumers find they can get and save files to cloud services.Bottom Line on BBY StockThe new administration wants to whip deflation now and, by allowing price hikes on oil and other resources, they could achieve the goal. China, too, seems dedicated to fighting deflation, giving raises to many workers in a more competitive market.This should mean good news for Best Buy, which is focusing more on products like ovens and washing machines that have mechanical parts which sometimes break. A new round of high-end phones should also help the top line.Bottom line? At a price-to-earnings multiple of under 14, and a dividend yielding 2.5% (that the company is in a great position to raise), BBY stock might be Best Buy's best bargain.Dana Blankenhornis a financial and technology journalist.

Could Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Take a Hint From Best Buy Co Inc (BBY)?;3/1/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) buysMacy's Inc(NYSE:M). It's a crazy idea, right? AMZN stock has barely budged over the past couple of weeks sincereportssurfaced that Canada'sHudson's Bay Co(OTCMKTS:HBAYF) was in talks to buy America's largest seller of apparel. Clearly, investors aren't holding their breath.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockThe media, on the other hand, has been busy speculating on the odds of a company like Amazon getting into a bidding war with the iconic Canadian retailer that is run by an American and also ownsSaks IncandLord & Taylor.Opinions vary on whether Amazon boss Jeff Bezos would make such a move, but let me assure you, it won't be for the real estate.No, if AMZN does make a play for Macy's it will be for other, more-sensible business reasons. In fact, you could say Amazon would be taking a page out of the playbook ofBest Buy Co Inc(NYSE:BBY), one of Amazon's biggest rivals in electronics retail.How's that, you say? Let me explain.AMZN Apparel Market ShareIn case you missed it, Amazon has been slowly entering the apparel businesssince debutingits own private-label brands in early 2016 with 1,800 products available for sale under names such as Scout and Ro, Franklin and Freeman, and Society New York.Essentially, it's trying to fill the gaps not covered by its third-party sellers. However, a bigger attraction of doing its own thing isn't lost on investors of AMZN stock, which is that you make more selling your own stuff than you do somebody else's.7 Best Stocks to Buy for a Donald Trump Green LightAccording to Cowen & Co., Amazon is expected to pass Macy's in 2017 as America's top apparel seller and by 2022 should have16.2% market share.While it could do most of this through its websites, having brick-and-mortar stores has always been on the minds of analysts and retail experts alike.""We believe this deal could address some of (Amazon's) major consumer pain points,"" wrote Cowen & Co. analyst Oliver Chen in a recent report discussing the possibility of it buying Macy's. ""Amazon needs better brands, a more curated assortment, a physical place to return items, and customers could use help with ensuring fit - Macy's would also give Amazon greater credibility in curation and fashion authority.""That last part's a bit of stretch. I'm pretty sure if Amazon knocked on your door and you're a private label apparel manufacturer, you'd let them in.Real EstateTo take full advantage of its private label expansion, real estate is going to become an important part of the equation as AMZN expands into brick-and-mortar locations. It's not a matter of if Amazon will do this, in my opinion, but when.Right now there is an abundance of retail real estate coming on stream through all the various store closings across America, including68 Macy's stores- part of the bigger 100 store closings announcement from last summer - in 2017, so finding space isn't going to be a problem for AMZN.If you remember what happened toTarget Corporation(NYSE:TGT) in Canada, buying all those leases in one big deal ultimately was its undoing because it put way too much pressure on its employees to execute such a big undertaking.So, there is the argument that Amazon could expand one target market at a time until it has stores across the U.S. Unfortunately, that would take a decade or longer to execute. If it really wants to open retail stores this isn't an appropriate solution for a growth company like AMZN.Why Best Buy?Business wasn't looking good for the Minneapolis-based electronics retailer until CEO Hubert Joly turned the company upside down in 2012 implementing its infamous ""Renew Blue"" turnaround plan that turned physical store locations into local distribution hubs for its e-commerce business.Former CFO Sharon McCollamcalled the ship-from-storeinitiative in February 2016 ""one of the most important and strategic decisions in (Best Buy's) history.""The numbers don't lie. In November, Best Buydelivered strongstrong Q3 2017 results that included continued growth for its e-commerce business along with positive same-store sales growth. It's taken multi-channel retail to the next level.Why Apple Inc. (AAPL) Will Become a Trillion-Dollar Company""Best Buy's third quarter online growth of over 24% results in a very solid quarter, and continues to validate the company's multi-channel transformation,"" Moody's lead retail analyst Charlie O'Sheasaid in November.Renew Blue's been such a success that retail expert Walter Loeb named Joly his 2016 Retailer of the Year.Bottom Line on AMZN StockBy acquiring Macy's, AMZN would be able to push its products onto the store floors where it could learn more about what apparel shoppers want, while seriously lowering its shipping expenses by implementing a ship-from-store initiative much like Best Buy.Yes, it's already invested billions in warehouses across the country, but getting closer to the customer is never a bad thing; buying Macy's might not happen but if it does, it's got nothing to do with owning real estate and everything to do with AMZN owning the customer.As of this writing, Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceElon Musk Is Drilling a Hole in Tesla Inc (TSLA) StockThe Bank of America Corp (BAC) Stock Rally Is Nearing Its End7 Stocks That Will Hit All-Time Highs in 2017The postCould Amazon.com, Inc.

The index, in fact, has seen a huge rally since the Presidential election, crossing the psychologically mark of 20,000 and now stands within a striking distance of 21,000.President Donald Trump's polices including tax cuts and pickup in infrastructure outlays restored expectations of a pro-growth agenda that helped the Dow push further into the record territory. Hence, investing in blue chip stocks is sure to be rewarding, especially financial behemoths as shares of such companies skyrocketed, banking on Trump's promise to rip up financial regulations.Stellar Dow Rally, CEOs Make a FortuneThe Dow industrials registered a 12th straight record close on Feb 27 as investors look for details when the President addresses lawmakers on Feb 28. This 12-session record run matches the longest streak that ended in Jan 1987. The blue-chip index hasn't reached a 13 straight session of record close ever, according to Dow Jones data.CEOs of Dow companies have made a fortune for themselves. Collectively they have witnessed around $400 million surge in the value of their stock holdings since Trump's election, according to a study by Equilar, which calculated their returns in mid-February. This is an 18.4% increase, way above the Dow's overall gain of 11% during that period.Much of those gains were attributed to leaders of banking behemoths The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS-Free Report) and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM-Free Report). Goldman's CEO Lloyd Blankfein saw his stock holdings soar 30%, banking on the post-election rally. Similarly, JPMorgan's CEOJamie Dimon raked in a lot of moolah in this span.Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL-Free Report), a staunch critic of the Trump administration, also saw its shares jump 23% since his victory.

He plans a multi-trillion-dollar tax cut that will boost the U.S. economy and drive corporate profits. Such a tax cut includes the trimming of the business tax rate to 15% from 35%, reducing individual tax rates and elimination of the estate tax. Corporates will also get a chance to repatriate foreign profits at a rate of 10%.Trump is in favor of beefing up public spending by hundreds of billions of dollars on infrastructure. He said that he will support more spending on transportation and telecommunications infrastructure, clean water and electricity transmission in order to accelerate economic growth. Trump had said that ""we are going to fix our inner cities, and rebuild our highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, schools, hospitals. We're going to rebuild our infrastructure, and we will put millions of our people to work as we rebuild it"" (read more:Top Stock Picks for Trumps Trillion Dollar Infrastructure Plan).Trump, in the meantime, signed an executive order to scale back the Dodd-Frank Act. The President views the Dodd-Frank regulatory overhaul as a harsh measure, especially, on banks as they had to beef up compliance compartments to deal with a list of new rules. Trump's team is also focusing on scaling back the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which serves as a watchdog on big players in the economy (read more:5 Stocks to Buy as Trump Raises Hopes for Banking Sector).2 Financial Blue-Chips for Your PortfolioInvestors should be optimistic about possibility of positive economic policy change from the Trump administration, which should further help blue chip stocks rise steadily in the near term.

Why Apple Inc. (AAPL) Will Become a Trillion-Dollar Company;3/1/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe market is making new highs seemingly every day. TheS&P 500,Nasdaq Compositeand other major indices are in uncharted territory, and the stock that value investors doubted is following suit.Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) is now worth $720 billion by market capitalization. And improbably, the $1 trillion mark - at $189 per share for AAPL stock, that's still a lofty 40% away - is at least in the realm of possibility now.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockAlso improbably, Apple stock, at around 16 times earnings, is somewhere between undervalued and fairly valued. Warren Buffett'sBerkshire Hathaway Inc.(NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B) still believes in the value proposition, adding AAPL shares in the most recent quarter, according to Berkshire's13-F filing.Morgan Stanley has raised its target price on AAPL stock to $154. UBS says Apple shares are worth $138. So the analysts are on board too.But $189?How Can Apple Hit $1 Trillion?If Apple traded at $189 per share without any of its financials changing, that would assume a P/E that has climbed to about 22 times earnings. That higher multiple would have to reflect investor expectations that iPhone 7 sales are growing, though more likely, that the iPhone 8 will be a smash hit.7 Stocks That Will Hit All-Time Highs in 2017That's plausible, considering the woes ofSamsung's(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) Galaxy Note 7 fiasco, not to mention strong first-quarter iPhone sales.Another way to look at it is through the revenue lens.Looking ahead, Apple projects second-quarter revenue of between $51.5 billion-$53.5 billion and gross margin in the range of 38%-39%. The $1 trillion market cap would value the stock at 4 times sales, up from 3.3 times. And it seems unlikely that investors would trade Apple to those kinds of multiples without anything else happening.Apple needs iPhone sales to grow more than the 5% year-over-year figure last quarter. It certainly needs iPads to reverse a 19% YOY drop in revenue. Services, though, is a huge bright spot, growing revenue from 18% YOY, and the segment is accelerating to become a bigger piece of the revenue pie. Continuing that track would certainly help AAPL's chances.iPhone 8 ReleaseThe biggest continuous headline this year is Apple's 10th anniversary iPhone release, believed to be called either the iPhone 8 or theiPhone X.Currently, while the market is optimistic about AAPL stock, it's not pricing in the potential for double-digit revenue growth in iPhone sales on the back of iPhone 8. That would also include reversing the iPhone's slowing sales in China.Anything's possible in China right now, though.Xiaomi was the leader in Chinese smartphone market share in China in Q1 of 2015. In 2016, Huawei and Oppo took the first and second spot, respectively, in China. Apple's position dropped sharply to thefifth spot. However, cutting prices of the iPhone 7 and promoting that particular model in the region could help AAPL compete more effectively.Another Note About ValuationEven if Apple doesn't blow the doors off with iPhone 8 sales, the market isn't against rewarding gigantic tech titans without them boasting breakneck growth.Microsoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) trades at a P/E of 30 and P/S of 6. P/E and 6x sales (price/sales). Still, Microsoft is expected to grow earnings by about 7% compared to Apple's 7.6% expected growth this year, and next year the disparity expands, with analysts projecting 13.5% profit growth from Apple but just 9.4% from Microsoft.Speaking of corporate software titans, Apple has partnered withInternational Business Machines Corp.(NYSE:IBM) to develop corporate software. In time, Apple will generate more meaningful revenue from this space.Bottom LineLastly, we'll discuss Apple's giant war chest. AAPL has $246 billion in cash, or around $30 a share in net cash. Assuming a 15% repatriation tax (which in theory could go away with aTrump repatriation tax holiday), AAPL will have $23 per share in cash.This is the company's buyback activity last quarter:""We returned almost $15 billion to investors during a very busy December quarter for our capital return activities. We paid $3.1 billion in dividends and equivalents. We spent $5 billion on repurchases of 44.3 million Apple shares through open market transactions. And we launched a new $6 billion ASR, resulting in an initial delivery and retirement of 44.8 million shares.""Apple currently yields a modest 1.7%. Combined with regular buybacks and debt reduction, AAPL stock holders are getting plenty of value out of Apple's cash as it is.The Bank of America Corp (BAC) Stock Rally Is Nearing Its EndI expect Apple to continue moving higher for all of the above reasons, especially if the broader market continues to melt higher.A lot needs to happen for AAPL stock to gain 40% and reach a trillion dollars in market cap, especially within the next year, but a blowout iPhone 8 release could very well get it done.As of this writing, Chris Lau did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceWhat Is Apple Inc.

Apple (AAPL) 2017 Shareholders Meet: Important Takeaways;3/1/2017;"At the annual shareholders' meet held at Cupertino yesterday,Apple Inc.AAPLCEO Tim Cook, reportedly,  said that the company has spent over $50 billion with suppliers toward manufacturing in the U.S.Per media reports, Cook further added that Apple has created around 2 million jobs in the country including manufacturing jobs. It has collaborated with 3M, a Minnesota-based manufacturer for supplying adhesives and has Corning IncorporatedGLWto supply glass screen for iPhones.Cook was quoted by media reports saying ""We're always looking for more ways to help our country. We know that Apple can only exist in the U.S."" Cook said that nearly 70% its workforce is in the U.S.Apple has been subject to intense scrutiny by President Donald Trump regarding the ""manufacturing"" issue.Throughout his campaign, Trump opposed Apple's decision to manufacture goods overseas and even promised that he will urge Apple to bring manufacturing jobs back to the country. Trump was quoted speaking to The New York Times in Nov 2016, ""One of the things that will be a real achievement for me is when I get Apple to build a big plant in the United States, or many big plants in the United States, where instead of going to China, and going to Vietnam, and going to the places that you go to, you're making your product right here.""In fact, to alleviate Apple's concern of increased prices of finished products, Trump told Cook that he will provide tech companies huge tax cuts. Cook added that the lowering of tax will aid repatriation of cash, which in turn will be used to boost capital allocation plans.In January this year, it was reported that one of Apple's biggest suppliers,Foxconn TechnologyGroup is thinking of setting up a manufacturing plant in the United States. Though the exact details aren't available, Foxconn is interested in investing over $7 billion in setting up such facilities in the U.S. Prior to that, media reports claimed that Apple hasrequestedthe government to allow it to use its Mesa, AZ facility to conduct ""high-tech manufacturing"".Apart from manufacturing details, Cook, reportedly, assured investors that the company is working on developing products that will open new sources of revenues. No details were provided as to what the company is working on. However, it's widely known that Apple is channeling efforts and resources toward its automotive and AR ambitions.Apple Inc. PriceApple Inc. Price|Apple Inc. QuoteOn asked about net neutrality, Cook said that ""content should be treated the same, and there should be no unfair advantage for one group over another."" Net neutrality has come under fire since the new government took over the White House. Ex-president, Barack Obama was in favor of net neutrality. However Trump doesn't share his views.Media reports quoted FCC chairman Ajit Pai, at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, saying ""The FCC decided to apply last-century, utility-style regulation to today's broadband networks. Our new approach injected tremendous uncertainty into the broadband market. And uncertainty is the enemy of growth."" However, Pai has assured that he is ""committed to ensuring an open Internet."" Analysts observe that any changes in net neutrality could make some of Apple's services relatively expensive and that might hurt its Services business.Zacks Rank & Share Price MovementAt present, Apple carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Given the phenomenal performance of its iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, Apple's shares have outperformed the broader market over the last six months.

What Warren Buffett Likes About Sirius XM (SIRI);3/1/2017;"Who would have thought Sirius XM (SIRI), which once traded for pennies, would ever qualify as a “Buffett stock?” But that’s precisely the claim the New York-based satellite radio station can now make.According to a recent regulatory filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, billionaire investor Warren Buffett, CEO of Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) (BRK.B), is now one of Sirius XM’s biggest fans after his conglomerate acquired 166.64 million Sirius shares between October and December 2016. Berkshire’s SIRI stake, which now stands at 741,547 shares, is was worth in the neighborhood of $750 million.What does Buffett see in SIRI?makeArticleAd();Once left for dead at the height of the 2008 recession, Sirius XM, which has a monopoly in the realm of automobile satellite radio, has come roaring back with a vengeance, thanks to booming U.S. auto sales over the past couple of years. SIRI stock, which closed Tuesday at $5.09 per share, has risen 38% over the past year, including more than 14% year to date, besting the S&P 500 index in both spans. And if you’ve held SIRI stock of the past five years, you’re up 130%, or about 26% gains annually.Obviously, Buffett, who arguably is the best value investor of all time, would have loved to have bought Sirius shares much sooner. But the fact that he’s bought in now would suggest that he still sees value in the years ahead. Plus, Buffett is known to place his long-term bets where he sees strong management teams. In that regard, the fact that Sirius has posted better-than-expected revenue for most of the last ten quarters, might have caught Buffett’s attention.Sirius’ streak of strong execution might have given Buffett the confidence to allay fears about competition from the likes of Apple’s (AAPL), which Buffett owns. Same goes for apps like Spotify, Pandora (P), and so on. Over the past couple of years, Sirius has taken each new entrant’s best shot and not only has survived, it continues to generate tons of cash ($1.5 billion in FCF in 2016) and has implemented a dividend.In that regard, while 2017 auto sales, which Sirius relies on to grow its subscribers, may have a tough comp against 2016, Buffett is likely looking beyond 2017 and possibly other scenarios that may work in Sirius’ favor. An acquisition by Apple, for example, which has been rumored about for years, can’t be ruled out. But until then, Buffett is going to ride Sirius’ cash cow and dividend for as long as he can. And retail investors should pay attention."

Nimble Storage: Why We Went Long;2/28/2017;"BySuhail Capital:We recently picked up some Nimble Storage (NYSE:NMBL) shares. The position is to a degree on the more speculative side of things for us as we have generally hated the flash storage vendor space and broader enterprise storage space for years, but as is always the case in markets at some point things change.The starting point for this thesis has been our desire to look outside of semiconductors/platform tech giants/and enterprise software for some appealing longs in the broader technology industry. Storage has been that spot for us of late. We have dabbled since late last fall with outright investments in the likes of Network Appliance (NASDAQ:NTAP) or even related names with industry exposure like VMware (NYSE:VMW) on the software defined storage side or Nutanix (NASDAQ:NTNX) as far as hyper converged vendors pure plays go. But the operative word here is dabbled, as we have been reluctant to commit to a bullish view on the sector.makeArticleAd();Why have we been so reluctant?A Brief Trip Down Storage Memory LaneWell, in short the enterprise storage space has been a notoriously bad place to be long anything for a very long time. In fact there hasn't been a true public success story in the space since NTAP. And we define success by a public billion + sales company that is profitable and actually generates returns for shareholders. What the space has instead offered up is a very long list of fantastically hyped up short opportunities.Our experience here goes all the way back to STEC, a leader in the SSD market with what was supposed to be game changing flash controller technology, which in retrospect ended up providing the script for all enterprise flash storage related investing for years to come. Now we could probably write a short story about our experiences with STEC as we initially bought into the hyped disruptor pitch, before quickly changing directions once we got to know the management and space. Whether it was dodgy CEOs, mind-boggling related party transactions, insider trading, blue-chip customer name dropping, or crazy one-time orders that never ever rematerialized; STEC had it all. But as far as this note is concerned all that mattered here is the stock and business quickly collapsed as the industry quickly shifted. Ultimately STEC's technology was acquired for a fraction of its previous value by [[WDC]].Naturally, the STEC experience made us very wary of the next hot name in the space: Fusion-IO. This server side flash caching PCIe card company which Facebook (FB) and Apple (AAPL) couldn't live without and with genius Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak as CTO was an instant market darling. Fusion was also a tough short because their business didn't implode overnight. The demand for their technology was initially there, but over time the growth and margins didn't pan out as expected as the broader demand for flash caching never really took off as expected. Why? Well, in our view the technology became more complimentary versus necessary as the affordable all-flash array market took off. That being said, selling out to Sandisk at half its IPO price from a couple years earlier ended up being a far better final outcome than the next hot name in the space would face.Violin Memory burst on the scene as the all-flash array game changer that was going to rock the storage market, but that unraveled fairly quickly after HP dumped them to focus on their own in house 3par strategy. After problems with HP torpedoed a $2bl plus dream IPO, Violin was forced to float at all costs just to sustain the business. The story was spun some, but really you didn't need to be a genius to figure out this was a name to avoid. The subsequent IPO was a flop, and the Violin model never got any better. The consensus view on what went wrong here was that Violin's custom memory-based approach to its all-flash array solution vs. commodity SSD was what killed them, as the likes of Pure Storage (PSTG) arrived in their space and larger storage providers like EMC got more aggressive. Either way, Violin went from IPO to Chapter 11 in 3 years. That's called a disaster, and yet here we are about to make a case for going long Nimble Storage.A Little Nimble IPO HistoryNimble's IPO was around the same time as Violin's disaster, but ended up being an instant success. Shares closed up over 60% on the first day of trading, and within two months traded to a market value of just under $5 billion and valuation of 50x ttm revenue. Naturally, we read the prospectus and sat back waiting for a short opportunity, but at the time we were pretty busy with Veeva so couldn't do the detailed work. Anyway, it didn't really matter as a good chunk of the Nimble bubble burst in the Spring of 2014 with the rest of the tech IPO bubble crowd. When we finally got around to looking closely at the stock we had our fair share of doubts. The story around Nimble was that Hybrid Arrays are simpler and cheaper than AFAs and easier to manage software wise, and thus that its addressable market and growth opportunity outside of large enterprise were extremely appealing. The bull case was that the Enterprise AFA market would be left to the likes of Pure and EMC XtremIO to battle over, while Nimble actually got profitable pretty quick with its commercial hybrid focus. That obviously hasn't panned out as the stock trades at roughly a quarter of its post-bubble collapse level, has a market cap of roughly 2x its ttm revenue.So why do we like it now?The Case For NimbleThe case for Nimble obviously starts with the valuation. At a current enterprise value of roughly 1x expected 2017 revenue the stock is cheap, and trading at a discount to Pure Storage's multiple of 1.7x. Of course, in this space valuations can be misleading as technology can become obsolete awfully quick. So we are not really value hunting here in the traditional sense. In fact, we took a small position in Nimble calls in front of its last earnings as we wanted to express the view that its push into the AFA space was working. Although the trade didn't work due to a seemingly sour market mood at the time, we were pleased with the conference call and quarterly results. Anyway, we have been keeping a close eye on the name ever since. All we needed to get a little more comfortable initiating a position in the stock was evidence that the sector in itself has stabilized enough, and that broader tech hardware valuations could support a long case in the name. Well, we feel we hit that point recently. Specifically, the market headline tick the box type of bottom event that the Violin Memory bankruptcy provided in December gave us confidence that the cycle of shareholder value destruction in this space has probably come to an end. Thus, we got more comfortable with testing out our long thesis in the stock.Anyway, let's get a little more detailed here about what we were thinking thesis wise when we first started looking at Nimble. The bear case on the name has been pretty clear-cut. The short argument had been that Nimble didn't play at all in the enterprise all flash array market, and that Pure Storage's launch of the M10 would start to eat away at their share in the commercial space. This take coupled with typical investor skepticism around customer rocking software differentiation for such a vendor, plus the fact that hyper converged players like Nutanix tend to be viewed as more of an initial threat to use cases in Nimble's core market, made being bearish on the name not very difficult. The argument essentially was that Nimble would gradually burn through its cash and never succeed as a stand-alone vendor.And to be clear on the surface it was pretty hard to argue with this thesis, but then Nimble complicated things even further by announcing its entry into the all-flash array market. Thus, you now had to worry about its new product strategy failing, leading to an accelerating cash burn and becoming an unnecessary distraction for management in an already extremely cut-throat competitive environment. Basically, get ready for Violin Memory part deux. But here is the thing……Its Strategy Worked.Nimble has quickly and brilliantly succeeded with its move into the AFA space. It got to the $100 million annualized booking run rate in two quarters, and all the checks with customers that we have done have been overwhelmingly positive. Consequently, Nimble's odds of surviving as a stand-alone vendor in the space have drastically improved. In fact, our main concern now is that the company has become a glaring takeover target at these levels to just about half a dozen tech names with the resources and justification to pay 50%+ premium to the current share price to acquire them. And yet the stock is trading like viability going forward is still in question?How to Play ThisNimble reports its Q4 results next week and will guide on Q1. Consensus growth for next year is 22% while Pure's expectations are for 39%. We think Nimble is positioned to outgrow consensus and Pure is more likely to disappoint. So there is a nice pair trade here which looks even nicer because of the significant valuation gap between the two, and the fact that Nimble's gains are likely to come more and more at the expense of Pure. That being said, we think the current bull market in tech and glaring takeover appeal for an opportunistic suitor here make Nimble an easy outright long position for those who don't like to short/hedge with pairs.See alsoCenterPoint Energy, Inc. 2016 Q4 - Results - Earnings Call Slideson seekingalpha.com"

Uh Oh: Will Apple Inc. (AAPL) Ditch Lightning Port on iPhone 8?;2/28/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWe're at the stage where leaks and rumors are flying fast and furious aboutApple Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AAPL) upcoming 10th anniversary iPhone. Some of them - like the idea of a curved OLED display - have people excited. Others - like the possibility of a $1000-plus starting price - less so. But nothing is likely to generate the sort of controversy AAPL stock is courting with the latest rumored change. According toThe Wall Street Journal, the iPhone 8 will ditch Apple's proprietary Lightning cable in favor of USB-C.makeArticleAd();Source: AppleWhat the WSJ Says About the iPhone 8The Wall Street Journalpublished a report this morning outlining some of the key changes it feels arecoming with the new iPhone.Most of the detail matches previous speculation on the device. That includes losing the Home button for an all-glass front. It's also calling for a lofty $1,000 price point for the iPhone 8 - which it speculates may end up going by the name of ""10th Anniversary Edition.""The WSJis also backing the theory that the new iPhone will be equipped with a curved OLED display, similar to that used bySamsung Electronics Co Ltd(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) on its Galaxy S7 Edge smartphone.7 Blue-Chip Stocks That Are Flush With CashOne big change suggested by theWSJis a bombshell: Apple may ditch the Lightning port on the iPhone 8, opting to replace it with USB-C.Why Would AAPL Court Controversy with the iPhone 8?Apple has a long history of making controversial changes to its products, especially when it comes to eliminating or replacing ports.In the past year alone, it has faced backlash over eliminating the long-time standard 3.5mm headphone jack on the iPhone 7. And it's still trying to appease buyers of the new MacBook Pro, after eliminating all legacy ports andreplacing them with the new USB-C. Then there was the last big iPhone port change in 2012, when Apple ditched the 30-pin dock connector it had used with every iOS device since the 2003 generation iPods, rendering millions of docks useless.Its replacement? The Lightning port.Ditching the Lightning port on the iPhone 8 would be a long-term win for AAPL fans. USB-C is an industry standard and moving to it from a proprietary connection would mean not having to pay a premium for cables. It would also make Apple's overall product strategy a lot cleaner. Right now, every new iPhone comes with a USB to Lightning cable for charging - but Apple's own MacBook and new MacBook Pro have only USB-C ports. So new iPhone buyers can't connect their new iPhone to their new laptop without first investing in another proprietary Apple cable.Unfortunately, there are going to be iPhone 7 owners who bought new headphones equipped with a Lightning cable instead of the traditional 3.5mm headphone jack. Those people will not be thrilled that their new headphones - purchased because Apple ditched a standard port - will now be incompatible with the iPhone 8, again because AAPL ditched a standard port. They'll have to look for an adapter.There will be a confusing period of overlap. All iOS devices since 2012 have used Lightning and AAPL also uses that port for charging accessories like its latest wireless keyboard and the Apple TV's Siri remote. It's also likely that AAPL won't mess with iPhone 7 design, so the iPhone 7s - which will also release in 2017 - is likely to still have the Lightning connector. More potential for confusion …However, it won't be as bad for APPL as the switch to Lightning in the first place. Most manufacturers learned their lesson then and speakers now are primarily wireless instead of using a physical dock, so they won't be stranded.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog includeBerkshire Hathaway(NYSE:BRK.B-Free Report),American Express(NYSE:AXP-Free Report),Coca-Cola(NYSE:KO-Free Report),Apple(NASDAQ:AAPL-Free Report) andWal-Mart(NYSE:WMT-Free Report).Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations.Get #1Stock of the Day pick for free.Here are highlights from Monday's Analyst Blog:Warren Buffett on Active vs. Passive InvestingWarren Buffett, billionaire fundamental investor and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.B-Free Report), released his annual report to shareholders outlining ""The Bet."" Nine years ago, Mr. Buffett publicly bet that any set of five hedge funds could not outperform the S&P 500 index over a 10 year period of time; hedge funds charge high active management fees while the S&P 500 index is invested in through low cost index funds. Ted Seides, co-manager of Protégé Partners, stepped up to the plate against Mr. Buffett.Mr. Seides chose five funds-of-funds, which invest in a variety of hedge funds, and Mr. Buffett decided on a Vanguard S&P 500 index fund. The wager counted performance net of fees, costs and expenses which boils down Mr. Buffett's thesis of his bet: passive investing will outperform active management in the long run because costs strip away high performance possibilities.Sure enough, to date, Mr. Buffett is ahead in the race and declared victory. The wager began on January 1, 2008 and will end on December 31, 2017. Through 2016, the compounded annual increase for the Vanguard index fund is 7.1% and only an average of 2.2% for the five funds-of-funds.In his letter, Mr. Buffett writes, ""The bottom line: When trillions of dollars are managed by Wall Streeters charging high fees, it will usually be the managers who reap outsized profits, not the clients.""It is important to note that Mr. Buffett is not saying it is impossible to outperform the market. He prides himself on his ability to pick winning investments over losing investments. What Mr. Buffett is pointing to is that most active managers will fail; he states that more than $100 billion have been drained into bad investment advice in the past 10 years.Berkshire Hathaway never commits to holding a security, says Mr. Buffett. ""It is true that we own stock that I have no intention of selling…But we have made no commitment that Berkshire will hold any of its marketable securities forever,"" he wrote in his letter. There are positions which have been held onto for years such as American Express (NYSE:AXP-Free Report), and Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO-Free Report). However, for example, in 2016 Berkshire Hathaway bought large stakes in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL-Free Report) and sold a majority of their stake in Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT-Free Report) in an active charge to find yield.Wall Street shows that investors are leaning towards low cost index funds over active managers who promise to beat the market.The Wall Street Journalwrites that last year, investors pulled a net $342.4 billion out of active managers' hands and poured a record $505.6 billion into passively managed funds.Mr. Buffett's advice: it is best for investors to use low cost index funds rather than handing their assets to active managers who charge high fees. ""Both large and small investors should stick with low-cost index funds,"" he says.A Full-Blown Technological Breakthrough in the   MakingZacks' Aggressive Growth Strategist Brian Bolan explores autonomous cars in our latest Special Report, Driverless Cars: Your Roadmap to Mega-Profits Today.

Sony (SNE) PlayStationVR System Sales Break All Records;2/28/2017;"Sony Corporation'sSNEvirtual reality system for PlayStation4 - PlayStationVR (PS VR) - has been garnering unprecedented sales since its release in October, braving the market odds which have been hurting other business lines for long. As on Feb 19, 2017, Sony Interactive Entertainment (SIE), the gaming division of the company, reported that it had sold 915,000 PS VR units in the four months following its launch.makeArticleAd();This impressive sale performance is pretty satisfying for the company, which had estimated around unit sales of about a million in the first six months. According to the New York Times, the success of the PS 4 VR system is a close second to Apple Inc.'sAAPLiPhone, which had surpassed the 1.4 million mark in 2007 within the first three months of launch.A Strategic LaunchSony had previously deferred the launch of the VR headset for the flagship PlayStation 4 console from Jun to Oct 2016. The company had wanted to ensure that it has an extensive range of software available for the rollout so that it can ship an adequate number of units post launch. More than the deferred launch, the company's decision to price VR at just $399 was considered a prudent move as it offered the device for a discount of over $200 when compared to the offering of the rivals.Sony played smart by leveraging on its powerful installed base of PS4 customers to drive VR sales. The fact that the company already had 53.4 million PlayStation 4 units in use lent it an edge over peers.Where Do the Competitors Stand?Though Sony's chief VR competitors, namely Facebook, Inc.'sFBOculus Rift and HTC Vive, have not released the official sales figures, sources claim that they lag Sony by a wide margin. According to independent research firm SuperData Research, Oculus Rift has sold approximately 243,000 headsets while HTC managed to sell 420,000 units as of the end of last year.Higher costs as well as the need of high-performance PCs to support the other VR headsets are clearly acting in favor of Sony VRs. Meanwhile, the company is certain that its proprietary VRs offer the same level of quality and experience.Sony Bets Big on VRThe VR has attracted significant attention since its inception. Opinions have been divided with one group believing that virtual reality is the next big thing in the gaming space while others exhibited a cautious outlook. Leading companies, including Sony, have had reservations about how quickly virtual reality will be embraced. Recently, Facebook, which has been one of the earliest stake holders of VR, expressed its interest to invest up to $3 billion in the VR platform.Sony's exceptional sales clearly offer it an advantage in the budding VR market. As of Feb 19, 2017, PS VR software titles and experiences reached more than 100 globally with about 360 developers and publishers.Sony has chalked out lofty plans for VR as is evident from its series of game announcements for the headset. The upcoming launches, including that of ACE COMBAT 7 (BANDAI NAMCO Entertainment Inc.), FINAL FANTASY XV (SQUARE ENIX CO., LTD.), STEEL COMBAT (COLOPL, Inc.), TEKKEN 7 (BANDAI NAMCO Entertainment Inc.), Farpoint and Gran Turismo Sport (SIE WWS) are sure to pique consumer interest. By the end of 2017, over 100 new software titles and experiences are expected to be released.Gaming Raises HopeLeveraging on the strength of its flagship gaming product, PS4, Sony has braved most headwinds plaguing its other business lines. Over the past three months, the company's shares have returned 4.3%, in line with the Zacks categorizedAudio Video Home Productindustry average. PS4 continues to experience the fastest and strongest demand in the PS hardware history.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company expects the sales momentum to continue through fiscal 2016 and exceed the 17.7 million unit mark, which was recorded in the last fiscal. As per the company's mid-term business plan, console sales, subscriber addition to the PlayStation network and VR headset prospects are likely to emerge as key growth drivers. We believe VR headsets will drive the sales of PS4 gaming consoles further.Another stock worth mentioning in the same space is Dolby Laboratories, Inc.DLB. This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has a striking earnings surprise history, with an average surprise of 30.9% for the trailing four quarters, beating estimates each time.

Dow CEOs Make Millions: 2 Financial Blue Chips to Buy;2/28/2017;"The CEOs of most of the companies in the Dow Jones industrial average have seen huge increases in their worth, with the blue-chip index continuing its record winning streak. The index, in fact, has seen a huge rally since the Presidential election, crossing the psychologically mark of 20,000 and now stands within a striking distance of 21,000.President Donald Trump's polices including tax cuts and pickup in infrastructure outlays restored expectations of a pro-growth agenda that helped the Dow push further into the record territory. Hence, investing in blue chip stocks is sure to be rewarding, especially financial behemoths as shares of such companies skyrocketed, banking on Trump's promise to rip up financial regulations.Stellar Dow Rally, CEOs Make a FortuneThe Dow industrials registered a 12th straight record close on Feb 27 as investors look for details when the President addresses lawmakers on Feb 28. This 12-session record run matches the longest streak that ended in Jan 1987. The blue-chip index hasn't reached a 13 straight session of record close ever, according to Dow Jones data.CEOs of Dow companies have made a fortune for themselves. Collectively they have witnessed around $400 million surge in the value of their stock holdings since Trump's election, according to a study by Equilar, which calculated their returns in mid-February. This is an 18.4% increase, way above the Dow's overall gain of 11% during that period.Much of those gains were attributed to leaders of banking behemoths The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.GSand JPMorgan Chase & Co.JPM. Goldman's CEO Lloyd Blankfein saw his stock holdings soar 30%, banking on the post-election rally. Similarly, JPMorgan's CEOJamie Dimon raked in a lot of moolah in this span.Apple Inc.AAPL, a staunch critic of the Trump administration, also saw its shares jump 23% since his victory. The iPhone maker had criticized the administration's controversial immigration ban. But, the value of shares possessed by its CEO Tim Cook climbed considerably since the election. Other CEOs who have benefitted from the Trump Bump include American Express'AXPchief Kenneth Chenault and Boeing'sBADennis Muhlenberg.Let's take a look at how much their shares have gained since Trump's win last year.CEOCompanyIncrease in ValueLloyd BlankfeinGoldman Sachs$145.7 millionJamie DimonJP Morgan$115.5 millionTim CookApple$22.6 millionKenneth ChenaultAmEx$12 millionDennis MuilenburgBoeing$4 millionSource: EquilarTrump Rally Boosts Dow JonesWall Street has bid up stocks since the election as investors bet that Trump's market-friendly policies will stimulate the broader economy and boost corporate profits.Trump plans to overhaul tax codes for businesses and individuals over the next two to three weeks. He plans a multi-trillion-dollar tax cut that will boost the U.S. economy and drive corporate profits. Such a tax cut includes the trimming of the business tax rate to 15% from 35%, reducing individual tax rates and elimination of the estate tax. Corporates will also get a chance to repatriate foreign profits at a rate of 10%.Trump is in favor of beefing up public spending by hundreds of billions of dollars on infrastructure. He said that he will support more spending on transportation and telecommunications infrastructure, clean water and electricity transmission in order to accelerate economic growth. Trump had said that ""we are going to fix our inner cities, and rebuild our highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, schools, hospitals. We're going to rebuild our infrastructure, and we will put millions of our people to work as we rebuild it"" (read more:Top Stock Picks for Trumps Trillion Dollar Infrastructure Plan).Trump, in the meantime, signed an executive order to scale back the Dodd-Frank Act. The President views the Dodd-Frank regulatory overhaul as a harsh measure, especially, on banks as they had to beef up compliance compartments to deal with a list of new rules. Trump's team is also focusing on scaling back the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which serves as a watchdog on big players in the economy (read more:5 Stocks to Buy as Trump Raises Hopes for Banking Sector).2 Financial Blue-Chips for Your PortfolioInvestors should be optimistic about possibility of positive economic policy change from the Trump administration, which should further help blue chip stocks rise steadily in the near term.

Warren Buffett Has Boosted His Apple, Inc. Position Nearly Tenfold in 4 Months;2/27/2017;"Just a couple weeks ago, 13F filings started flowing in, andBerkshire Hathaway's(NYSE: BRK-A) (NYSE: BRK-B) ownership disclosures showed thatWarren Buffett nearly quadrupledhisApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) position in the fourth quarter. The Oracle of   Omaha closed out 2016 with approximately 57.4 million shares, up   from the 15.2 million shares that Berkshire Hathaway was holding   at the end of the third quarter.Well, it turns out that Buffett wasn't done loading up on   Apple. Not by a long shot.Berkshire Hathaway is now the single largest holder of   AppleIn aninterview with CNBCthis morning, Buffett shared some more about what Berkshire   Hathaway has been buying in the early innings of 2017. Spoiler   alert: even more Apple. Since the close of the fourth quarter   that's covered by the 13F, Buffett said that Berkshire continued   to buy shares up until earnings; Berkshire stopped buying shares   after earnings when shares jumped. Berkshiremore than doubledits Apple position during the month of January, and its total   holdings are now approximately 133 million shares, valued at   around $17 billion.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');While doubling an already large position over the course of a   month is already a pretty bullish signal to investors, it's even   more bullish when you compound that over a longer period of time.   As mentioned above, Berkshire finished the third quarter with   15.2 million shares, so a position of 133 million shares   represents a nearly tenfold increase in just 4 months.Data source: SEC filings and CNBC. Chart by author.Furthermore, shares are already up about 13% for February, so   Berkshire's Apple position continues to perform well, as shares   now trade at all-time highs.As famously averse to tech as Buffett is, it's just as well   known that he loves consistent cash flow. The Oracle notes that   the iPhone is incredibly sticky, and so many people have   integrated the device into their daily lives that it's become   indispensable. Apple customers are also incredibly loyal, so they   stick with the brand at a higher rate relative to other consumer   electronics companies. That all feeds back into cash flow, since   Apple is able to generate recurring hardware revenue with ongoing   product cycles.iPhone 7 with AirPods. Image source: Apple.At this point, Berkshire is the single largest holder of   Apple, with about a 2.5% stake in the company. The only companies   that hold more shares are fund companies like Vanguard and   Fidelity, among others, who aggregate their holdings across all   funds for reporting purposes. That includes passive funds and   ETFs that only hold Apple in order to track an underlying index,   although there are certainly some active funds in the mix as   well. For example, the single largest mutual fund holder of Apple   is theVanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund, a passive index fund that had 109.5 million shares at the end   of January (Apple is its largest holding).It's mildly ironic that an investor that's not into tech is   now the largest owner of the largest tech company.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

The Best Way to Beat the S&P 500;2/27/2017;"Investors use the Standard & Poor's index's performance to judge their own, and the Holy Grail is to outperform the index consistently.But what if I told you there was a way to outperform the index consistently by buying the index itself and doing almost no work for the additional gains?Sounds appealing and almost too good to be true.makeArticleAd();Well, it is true, and this technique is available to every investor.The reason this is possible is the way the S&P 500 is constructed. The index is computed by a weighted average market capitalization calculated by taking the number of shares outstanding of each company and multiplying the number by the company's current share price. This is a relatively lazy way of calculating an index and gives more weight to larger constituents and less weight to smaller companies so the index is disproportionately affected by a decline inApple(AAPL) compared to a smaller firm.OutdatedThis approach has worked well since the S&P 500's inception, but it isn't the best approach. Because small companies usually grow faster than their larger counterparts, it doesn't make much sense to give these companies a lower weighting in the index as it stunts their impact on the broader market. Surely, if small caps are given more weight, the index would perform better overall?That's exactly what the S&P 500 Equal Weight Index shows. The S&P 500 Equal Weight Index does what it says on the tin. The index gives each constituent an equal weight without taking into account market capitalization or other factors. The results of using this strategy have been extremely impressive. From 2003 through 2015, a $10,000 investment in the traditional S&P 500 index would have turned into $29,370. During that same period, the same investment in the S&P 500 Equal Weight Index would have turned into $38,866. Over the past five years, the S&P 500Equal Weight Index has returned 26.8% compared to the traditional S&P 500's return of 23.3%.What's behind the outperformance?There is a belief that the reason why equal weighted indexes outperform traditional market capitalization weighted peers is due to the weighting of small caps in the index. However, according to research conducted by Robert Ferguson and David Schofield, senior investment officer and president of Intech International, there is another reason why equal weight indexes tend to outperform over the long term.They believe the outperformance of equal weighted indexes has more to do with the index's constituent rebalancing than anything else. For example, to maintain required equal weights, the index provider has to sell a stock after a recent run higher but also buy more of a company if it has drastically underperformed over a set period. Put simply this trading requirement creates a ""buy low sell high"" trading strategy, which is both contrarian and momentum chasing.Ferguson and Schofield go on to note that surprisingly the underlying alpha source is always positive for such indicators, which is another indication that excess return has something to do with volatility. Equal-weighted indexes have a higher tracking error over time relative to the capitalization weighted index. The reason why this is the case lies in diversity.Diversity is at its maximum if all stock capitalizations are equal. Changes in diversity influence relative return of the equal-weighted portfolio. As the capital distribution curve has a typical shape, diversity must have a typical value with no long term trend. In this case, the influence due to changes in diversity will be close to zero over time, and the outperformance of the equal-weighted portfolio will be close to its volatility-based source, which is necessarily positive (stock returns can be both positive and negative, but volatility is always positive).When the effects of diversity are combined with contrarian/momentum investing, the equal weight index can capture higher alpha and less severe underperformance periods.Disclosure:The author owns no stock mentioned.Start afree seven-day trialof Premium Membership to GuruFocus.GILD 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of GILDPeter Lynch Chart of GILDPremium MembersThis article first appeared onGuruFocus."

Warren Buffett On Active vs. Passive Investing, Outlines 'The Bet' In Berkshire Shareholder Letter;2/27/2017;"Warren Buffett, billionaire fundamental investor and CEO of Berkshire HathawayBRK.B, released his annual report to shareholders outlining ""The Bet"". Nine years ago, Mr. Buffett publicly bet that any set of five hedge funds could not outperform the S&P 500 index over a 10 year period of time; hedge funds charge high active management fees while the S&P 500 index is invested in through low cost index funds. Ted Seides, co-manager of Protégé Partners, stepped up to the plate against Mr. Buffett.Mr. Seides chose five funds-of-funds, which invest in a variety of hedge funds, and Mr. Buffett decided on a Vanguard S&P 500 index fund. The wager counted performance net of fees, costs and expenses which boils down Mr. Buffett's thesis of his bet: passive investing will outperform active management in the long run because costs strip away high performance possibilities.Sure enough, to date, Mr. Buffett is ahead in the race and declared victory. The wager began on January 1, 2008 and will end on December 31, 2017.  Through 2016, the compounded annual increase for the Vanguard index fund is 7.1% and only an average of 2.2% for the five funds-of-funds.In his letter, Mr. Buffett writes, ""The bottom line: When trillions of dollars are managed by Wall Streeters charging high fees, it will usually be the managers who reap outsized profits, not the clients.""It is important to note that Mr. Buffett is not saying it is impossible to outperform the market. He prides himself on his ability to pick winning investments over losing investments. What Mr. Buffett is pointing to is that most active managers will fail; he states that more than $100 billion have been drained into bad investment advice in the past 10 years.Berkshire Hathaway never commits to holding a security, says Mr. Buffett. ""It is true that we own stock that I have no intention of selling…But we have made no commitment that Berkshire will hold any of its marketable securities forever,"" he wrote in his letter. There are positions which have been held onto for years such as Wells FargoWFC, American ExpressAXP, and Coca-ColaKO. However, for example, in 2016 Berkshire Hathaway bought large stakes in AppleAAPLand sold a majority of their stake in Wal-MartWMTin an active charge to find yield.Wall Street shows that investors are leaning towards low cost index funds over active managers who promise to beat the market.The Wall Street Journalwrites that last year, investors pulled a net $342.4 billion out of active managers' hands and poured a record $505.6 billion into passively managed funds.Mr. Buffett's advice: it is best for investors to use low cost index funds rather than handing their assets to active managers who charge high fees. ""Both large and small investors should stick with low-cost index funds,"" he says.A Full-Blown Technological Breakthrough in the   MakingZacks' Aggressive Growth Strategist Brian Bolan explores autonomous cars in our latest Special Report, Driverless Cars: Your Roadmap to Mega-Profits Today.

Applied Materials (AMAT): Why Investors Should Include It In Their Portfolio;2/27/2017;"Applied Materials, Inc.(AMAT)is the world's largest maker of semiconductor and display manufacturing equipment. It is impossible to pick up an electronic product from top brands and not have something inside that Applied Materials helped made. The company is not only a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), but it also has a Style Score of 'B' and multiple positive earnings estimates in the past 30 days. Below, I take a detailed look at Applied Materials' Style Scores and impressive earning estimates.ValueApplied Materials' stock trades at a PE of 13.88, compared to its industry, which has an average PE of 16.58. This means that Applied Materials is trading at a relative discount to its industry peers. It is reasonable to say that companies in this industry are decent choices for value investors but that Applied Materials is even better. No wonder, Applied Materials has a Style Score of 'B' for Value, especially with a PEG of just 0.9, which means the stock is currently cheap from an earnings growth perspective, too.GrowthApplied Material isn't just a great value choice, as it also has some interesting growth metrics as well. Also scoring a 'B' for its Growth Style Score, the company's projected earnings per share growth is at 47.67%, which crushes the industry average of 17.15%. Analysts also projected Applied Materials' sales growth to be 22.46%, which is easily ahead of the industry - coming in at 14.78%, again.Earnings EstimatesIn the past 30 days, Applied Materials has seen eight positive estimate revisions for the current quarter, compared to none lower. According toZacks Equity Research, the earnings estimate for the current quarter has also been favorable, with estimates rising from $0.62 a share 30 days ago to $0.76 per share today, a move of 22.6%.Promising OutlookApplied Materials is expecting a profitable second quarter in fiscal 2017 from their outstanding performance in the last two quarters. Not only did Applied Materials report record profit of $1.72 billion in the fourth quarter ending in October of fiscal 2016, but the company also reported record orders of $4.24 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. The company sees the second quarter of 2017 as another opportunity to set new records.Revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 rose by 45% year-over-year and is expected to grow even more as China looks to strengthen and expand its own chip and advanced panel industry. Applied Materials controls a large share of the market in China, as reported byNikkei Asian Review. Gary Dickerson, CEO and President of Applied Materials, said 2017 annual revenue in China would reach $2.6 billion.""I've never been so positive about our core businesses, and our position has never been better in our market,"" Dickerson toldNikkeireporters in Taipei on Wednesday. ""I am very excited about the near term and very excited about our future long term.""The major products that are helping the company's growth are the global demand of 3-D NAND flash memory chips and advanced organic light-emitting diode (OLED). The memory chips are used in a broad range of electronics such as laptops and mobile devices. OLED is considered a popular option for premium smartphones since Apple Inc.(AAPL)adopted them for the iPhone that's scheduled for release later this year.Bottom LineWith high demands and customers from around the world including Intel(INTC), Samsung Electronics, Toshiba, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.(TSM)and Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., Applied Materials is looking to be a powerhouse in its industry.The company expects net sales in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 to be in the range of $3.45 billion to $3.6 billion, which at the midpoint of the range will be approximately 44% growth year over year. With a record of consistently beating our consensus earnings estimate and positive growth in revenues and new orders, Applied Materials should be on your radar now if it's not already.A Full-Blown Technological Breakthrough in the   MakingZacks' Aggressive Growth Strategist Brian Bolan explores autonomous cars in our latest Special Report, Driverless Cars: Your Roadmap to Mega-Profits Today.

Get Paid to Trade International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) Stock;2/27/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsI have not been a fan ofInternational Business Machines Corp.(NYSE:IBM) for a long time. It is my opinion that management was slow to shift cash cows. They lost their way and have yet to recover. They have been trying to carve a niche in artificial intelligence, but that story has been over a decade in the making. To use a poker term, they are pot-committed to AI.makeArticleAd();Luckily, artificial intelligence has seen a recent resurgence in popularity so the wait may actually pay off to IBM longs.Experts are in awe of what Watson can do. Unfortunately, its profit stream is taking too long to develop. IBM is no longer the sure long-term bet it once was. To me, it more resembles a startup with a cool product still finding its way.Click to EnlargeUsually, I like to sell longer-dated risk in companies that I believe are long-term winners likeAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) orApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL). In this case, I am putting my trust in the IBM price action more so than its fundamentals.The Bet:Sell the IBM Oct $130 put. This is a bullish trade for which I collect $1.40 per contract to open. This trade has a 90% theoretical chance of success. This sounds like a great idea now, but it comes with risk. By selling the put naked, I am committing to buying the stock at $130 per share if IBM falls below it. Anything below $128.60 per share would accrue losses for me.The 7 Best ETFs for Retirement InvestorsSelling naked puts is not suited for most investors, so I can modify the trade to make it more attainable.The Alternate:Sell IBM $140/$135 credit put spread. This also is a bullish trade, but one with a finite risk profile. I collect 40 cents per contract to open. The 22% price buffer is smaller than that of selling the $130 naked put but for the finite risk profile advantage.While 40 cents may sound too little, it would represent an 8% yield on money risked and for the high chance of success it carries it should elate most investors.I chose longer-dated risk so I don't have to fret the short-term gyrations. I find that longer-dated options risk is easier to manage. Also, I can close either of these trades at any time for partial gains or losses.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director ofSellSpreads.com.

This brings the total value of his investment in the company to $17 billion. The recent acquisition also makes AAPL the second-largest holding for Berkshire Hathaway Inc.When asked about the reason behind his recent investment in Apple Inc., Warren Buffett said that the company's ""strikes me as having quite a sticky product."" He also said that he feels that AAPL CEO Tim Cook is doing a""terrific job""with the company, reportsReuters.Warren Buffett investment in Apple Inc. now gives him a2.5% stakein the tech company.

Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.B) Stock Is Even Stronger Than Before;2/27/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAs if investors needed another reason to ownBerkshire Hathaway Inc.(NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B) stock, Warren Buffett's gone and done just that. You'd have to be living under a rock somewhere not to be aware of the factApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL)becamethe world's most valuable company in early February; the first to surpass $700 billion in market cap enriching all those owning Apple stock.makeArticleAd();Source:Pete Souza via Wikimedia (Modified)Only months ago, Apple waspassedbyAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) as the world's most valuable company, but since then, AAPL stock has gone on a huge run, up 52% since May 12, 2016, the day the two companies switched roles.By comparison, GOOGL stock is up 16% in the same period. A respectable performance - 200 basis points better than theSPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust(NYSEARCA:SPY) - but not enough to keep it in the top spot.Why AAPL Stock Gives Berkshire Hathaway a Big BoostApparently, Warren Buffett and/or his two money managers - Todd Combs and Ted Weschler - were buying heavily in the fourth quarter of the year. At the end of Q3 2016, BRK.B held 15.2 million shares of Apple stock; by the end of the year that ballooned 268.2% to57.4million shares, a stake currently worth $7.8 billion through Feb. 23.As a result of this buying binge, Berkshire Hathaway is one of AAPL's 10 largest shareholders owning 1.1% of Apple stock. Of greater importance to BRK.B stock owners is the fact AAPL stock is now its sixth largest equity position representing5%of the entire portfolio and not too far off Berkshire's investment inInternational Business Machines Corp.(NYSE:IBM), which accounts for 9% of the equity portfolio.7 Best Stocks to Buy for a Donald Trump Green LightIt's amazing to think that Buffett didn't own any tech stocks in2011when he started buying IBM and now these two businesses represent one-seventh of Berkshire Hathaway's $148 billion equity portfolio.So, if diversification is your thing, Buffett's move into Apple stock is just another reason why you might want to own BRK.B stock.Sure, the company is firing on all cylinders, not to mention AAPL stock is still relatively cheap at 16 times earnings or about 25% lower than theS&P 500, but those iPhone sales have a way of going sideways at a moments notice.Remember the first half of 2016?It wasn't all peaches and cream as investors fretted about Apple's continuing sales slowdown. Ebbs and flows are common in the tech business.

Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO) Is in a Rut, and Income Investors Love It;2/27/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsCisco Systems, Inc.(NASDAQ:CSCO) has justdelivered second-quarter FY17 earningsthat beat expectations on Wall Street, but once again proved that Cisco stock will not be returning to growth any time soon.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockCisco reported fourth-quarter revenue of $11.6 billion, $50 million above Wall Street consensus estimate, but -1.7% year-over-year. That marked the fifth straight quarter that the company has posted falling revenue.Sadly, things appears set to remain that way for at least the next few quarters. After all, Cisco guided to revenue growth of -2% to breakeven for the current quarter, and sees non-GAAP per-share earnings coming in at 57 cents 59 cents, in line with Wall Street's consensus of 58 cents.Oddly enough, Cisco stock has tucked on gains of 6% since the earnings call, reversing the selloff that happened immediately after the results. Cisco stock is now up a solid 13.3% year-to-date. So why, pray, are investors celebrating Cisco's revenue tailspin?Business Model Transition for Cisco StockCSCO is stuck in the throes of a serious business model transition. Since its early days, the company has been in the business of selling switches and routers that move data around the internet. That's still true in a big way since the company still derives more than 40% of its revenue from this networking business.But with more and more companies relying on rented computing services from the likes ofMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) andAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN), they are buying less and less of Cisco's hardware for their data centers.Even worse is the fact that when they do buy, they are upgrading to newer devices less often. Further, Cisco is increasingly facing tougher competition and cheaper offerings from the likes ofArista Networks Inc(NYSE:ANET), a company that was founded by former top Cisco executives.Throw in the fact that more companies are experimenting with software-defined networking (SDN), and Cisco is finding itself caught between a rock and hard place. Last quarter's results say it all: Cisco's switching and routing revenue for the quarter fell 5%  and 10% to $3.3 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively.But CSCO has, over the past few years, been working on a grand plan that involves pushing for a recurring subscription-based revenue model. This essentially means developing businesses that will protect it from the vagaries of the boom-and-bust cycles of its core business.Chief executive Chuck Robbins is optimistic that Cisco can leverage the lessons gleaned from its subscription-based businesses, such as Meraki cloud-controlled WiFi, Security software and Collaboration to build a solid subscription revenue businesses. Cisco's Security segment was the brightest spot in the earnings report after growing 14% to reach $528 million. Meanwhile the Collaboration business grew 4% to hit $1,062 million.Investors were pleased with Cisco's latest report is because it showed that the company is making progress discovering new recurring revenue streams. The company announced that product deferred revenue related to software and subscriptions grew 51% to reach $4 billion. Meanwhile, 10% of its $9 billion Product sales is now of a recurring nature, up from virtually zero a couple of years ago.Cash Cow and Dividend MachineFor all its troubles, Cisco remains by far the most dominant player in the networking business, something that has helped the company preserve its fat margins. During the last quarter, the company's Product gross margin decreased from 63.4% to 61.1%, but its Services gross margin increased from 65.1% to 67.7%. Improving margins is a good sign that the company's pricing power remains undiminished.Healthy margins have allowed CSCO stock to become a cash cow, with annual free cash flow approaching $13 billion. Cisco spends a lot of this cash on M&A activity. During the latest earnings call, Cisco announced that it was taking AppDynamics off the IPO table by doling out $3.7 billion for the application performance management startup. But income investors need not worry - in the same vein, Cisco announced that it was hiking its quarterly dividend by 3 cents to 29 cents.Cisco stock now yields a generous 3.5%, among the highest yields in theDow Jones Industrial Average.Bottom Line for Cisco StockCisco instituted the dividend six years ago when it declared a quarterly payout of 6 cents, good for a modest 1.4% yield. Since then, the company has hiked dividends at least once every year.Cisco is also sitting atop a cash hoard north of $60 billion, most of it stashed in overseas accounts. With the Trump administration looking to quickly enact legislation to lower corporate tax from 35% to 15% to 20%, Cisco will be in a position to repatriate at least some of that cash and continue rewarding investors.Mobile World Congress: Apple Inc. (AAPL) vs. Everyone ElseThe 10-year Treasury note has been rising, but at 2.52% remains well below the yield by Cisco stock. With such a healthy backdrop, Cisco stock remains a prime long-term holding especially for income investors.As of this writing, Brian Wu did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceThe 10 Best Stock Charts on Wall Street Right Now7 Food Stocks That Will Deliver Tasty ReturnsThe postCisco Systems, Inc.

AAPL August 18th Options Begin Trading;2/27/2017;"Investors in Apple Inc (Symbol: AAPL) saw new options become available today, for the August 18th expiration. One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 172 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. AtStock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the AAPL options chain for the new August 18th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $135.00 strike price has a current bid of $7.05. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $135.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $127.95 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of AAPL, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $137.22/share today.Because the $135.00 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 56%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under thecontract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 5.22% return on the cash commitment, or 11.08% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this theYieldBoost.makeArticleAd();Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Apple Inc, and highlighting in green where the $135.00 strike is located relative to that history:Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $140.00 strike price has a current bid of $6.50. If an investor was to purchase shares of AAPL stock at the current price level of $137.22/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $140.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 6.76% if the stock gets called away at the August 18th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if AAPL shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Apple Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing AAPL's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $140.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $140.00 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 54%. On our website under thecontract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 4.74% boost of extra return to the investor, or 10.05% annualized, which we refer to as theYieldBoost.The implied volatility in the put contract example is 21%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 22%. Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $137.22) to be 20%.

The Next Big Thing for Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN): Productivity Software;2/27/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) has taken on some unexpected targets lately. None more ambitious - and unforeseen - than sticking its Alexa personal assistant in the Amazon Echo smart speaker.makeArticleAd();Source: AmazonThat move has paid off with a big lead in the race to become the hub of the smart home, despite AMZN's complete lack of smartphone presence.Per a report inThe Information, Amazon is readying another bold move. If sources are correct, AMZN is preparing to take onMicrosoft Corporation's(NASDAQ:MSFT) Microsoft Office andAlphabet Inc.'s(NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google G Suite with its own cloud-based productivity suite.Report: Amazon.com Is Working on a Productivity SuiteThe Informationbroke the news that Amazon.com isworking on its own productivity suiteto take on Microsoft and Google. The website says AMZN's Amazon Web Services - AWS - unit has told some of its ""large corporate customers"" of its plans to offer a new suite of productivity apps that will compete against the two dominant players.7 REITs That Should Be CondemnedMicrosoft Office has always been considered a cash cow for the company. The productivity suite quickly became the industry standard, the applications of choice for enterprise, schools and home PC users. To make its software seem more affordable, to break free of the boom bust cycle between major versions of Microsoft Office, and to address the growing threat of Google's free Google Apps suite, five years ago, the company began pushing Office 365.This subscription version of Microsoft Office brought recurring monthly revenue and other advantages. Microsoft expanded into Office apps for mobile devices likeApple Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AAPL) iPad and began to sell online storage for Office 365 users, with OneDrive.Google Apps/G SuiteGoogle wasn't sitting still, though, refining Google Apps intoG Suite, a full-on competitor to Office 365, with paid monthly subscription plans and online storage options. The company has also leveraged Google Apps and its lightweight Chrome OS into Chromebooks - ultra-low-cost laptops that have been giving Microsoft fits, especially in the education market.That education market is where the potential for disruption is really playing out. With its free Google Apps and low-cost Chromebooks, Google upended the education market. By the end of 2015,more than half of all device in U.S. classrooms were Chromebooks. This has repercussions beyond the classroom, as those students turn into young professionals who are more comfortable with Google's productivity software than with Microsoft Office.I've seen the effect first hand. My kids do everything at school using G Suite, despite Microsoft offering free Office 365 subscriptions to students and computer labs full of Windows PCs. They ignore Microsoft Office and Apple's Pages/Numbers on our home computers, and instead log onto G Suite for doing homework.If Google could quickly make waves in one of Microsoft's key strongholds, why couldn't Amazon.com march in and disrupt both companies?Why Amazon Would Take On Microsoft OfficeThis is a key question. Taking on the Google and Apple in the smart home with the Amazon Echo made sense because the smart speaker was a Trojan horse. It offers a growing number of ""Skills"" that let it control other smart devices by voice command, or interact with online services.That ropes consumers into buying it. But Alexa is a voice-activated path to effortlessly order products directly from Amazon.com, and gives an incentive to buy other Amazon products and services like Amazon Music Unlimited and Amazon Fire TV.Where's the win for AMZN in offering productivity software, other than to tweak Microsoft and Google?For the answer, look to AWS. Amazon Web Servicesdominates the market for cloud infrastructureand the profit from this division is a big driver of Amazon's overall growth. Amazon already has the servers in place and it has several of the components needed for a productivity suite, including its WorkDocs and WorkMail apps and the recently announcedAmazon Chimevideo conferencing software. Stitch these together with a few additional components and Amazon could have its Microsoft Office and Google G Suite competitor.Google charges $5 to $10 per month for G Suite, while Microsoft Office 365 has several tiered options starting at $5.99 per month.AMZN could charge a competitive rate for its new offering, adding more subscription-based revenue to its bottom line while taking advantage of its existing cloud muscle. The base monthly fee could be supplemented by charging for additional online storage for enterprise customers - something it has plenty of.Productivity software could also become another free perk of Prime membership. Prime members that start using Amazon's productivity software could put pressure on their employers to invest in a subscription, in an effect like Google's approach that sees students graduate and look to their employers to provide G Suite access.The Dow Jones Industrial Average Keeps Rising, But a Correction Is ComingAMZN isn't commenting andThe Information'ssources say all of this is still in the early stages, but the move makes sense. Amazon has been aggressively expanding beyond its role as an online retailer, AWS has the infrastructure needed to support the initiative, the company has been creeping into enterprise software with apps like WorkMail, and Google proved that the Microsoft Office behemoth isn't invulnerable. A productivity software suite from Amazon.com could well be the company's next big thing.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace3 High-Impact Tech Earnings: Tesla, Fitbit and Square3 Dow Titans Buckling Under the PressureThe postThe Next Big Thing for Amazon.com, Inc.

Mobile World Congress: Apple Inc. (AAPL) vs. Everyone Else;2/27/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMobile World Congress is the industry's largest event for smartphone launches. Everyone who's anyone is there -unless your company name isApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL).makeArticleAd();Source: BlackBerryMWC 2017 officially started today, but the big announcements took place over the weekend.And in many ways, they set the stage for the coming battle for best smartphone that will pit Apple's 10th anniversary iPhone 8 andSamsung Electronics Co Ltd's(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) comeback Galaxy S8 against everyone else.Here's what you need to know aboutMWC 2017.Cutting Edge New SmartphonesMobile World Congress is the venue where many manufacturers choose to launch their new smartphones. That means the trends are set for what to expect in the coming year. At MWC 2017, there have been a few standouts that lead to some interesting conclusions.LG's new G6 smartphoneis one of the most talked about releases. The company abandoned the modular design it introduced in last year's G5. The new G6 incorporates design elements expected in the iPhone 8, with a glass front and back held together with a stainless-steel band.7 Best Stocks to Buy for a Donald Trump Green LightWhile bezels are still there, they're been minimized by moving the power button and fingerprint sensor to the back. The result is a 5.7-inch display in a compact body - and the display is wowing with its 564 ppi pixel density and support for HDR. The LG G6 also has a dual lens 13 megapixel camera, but unlike the iPhone 7 Plus, the extra lens is wide angle rather than telephone.Another interesting flagship release is theP10from China'sHuawei. This new premium smartphone includesLeica-branded cameras and a Portrait Mode to compete with iPhone 7 Plus feature. In addition, the P10 uses Huawei's own processor, the Kirin 960. This is bad news forQualcomm,Inc.(NASDAQ:QCOM), which is seeing more smartphone makers follow the lead of Apple by ditching the Snapdragon to develop their own customized chips.When the iPhone 8 arrives in the fall, its expected all-glass design isn't going to be as unique as Apple might have hoped. Cameras are going to be a big battleground, too, putting pressure on Apple to go further than it did with the dual-lens iPhone 7 Plus.No Galaxy S8 at MWC 2017Samsung traditionally unveils its new Galaxy S smartphones at Mobile World Congress. Not this year. Delayed by the Galaxy Note 7 battery investigation, Samsung is expected tounveil the Galaxy S8at an event on March 29.The company did take the wraps offtwo new tablets, though. The Galaxy Tab S3 and Galaxy Book. The latter is offered in two different sizes, runs Windows 10, comes with a snap-on keyboard case and stylus and is aimed atMicrosoft Corporation's(NASDAQ:MSFT) Surface Pro.Google Assistant Coming to Android Nougat and Marshmallow DevicesAlphabet Inc.(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) has had a big decision to make since introducing Google Assistant. The company broke with tradition to make its new AI-powered digital assistant exclusive to its own Google Pixel smartphones. But that restriction means the number of phones running Google Assistant are outnumbered by Siri-powered Apple devices andAmazon.com,Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AMZN) Alexa-powered smart speakers.Google chose MWC 2017 to announce it's decided to go back to the strategy of volume over exclusivity.Google Assistant will start rolling outto devices running Android Nougat and Marshmallow starting this week.BlackBerry and Nokia Makes a Splash at MWC 2017If you'd asked anyone a few months ago what companies would be generating buzz at MWC 2017, it's doubtful thatBlackBerry Ltd(NASDAQ:BBRY) orNokia Corp (ADR)(NYSE:NOK) would be anywhere on that list. But they both pulled it off. Sort of.BlackBerry's last hurrah in smartphones is the newBlackBerry KeyOne. The last phone with the company's name on it that was designed in-house combines Android with a classic BlackBerry keyboard. There's grumbling about the $549 price, but a general feeling that had BBRY releasedthisphone a few years ago, it might still be relevant in the smartphone space.The other big surprise was the return of the Nokia brand. Finland'sHMD Globalbought the rights to use the Nokia name on phones, and at MWC 2017 it announcedthree new Nokia Android smartphonesaimed at the Chinese market.The company is also bringing back the classic Nokia 3310 cell phone. Considered to be virtually indestructible, the Nokia 3310 was first released in 2000 andsold over 126 million units. The new version is a little less sturdy, but has new colors, and updated display and runs just over $50.Nokia gets some licensing revenue out of this, but was not involved in the development of the new phones bearing its brand.Everyone Against the iPhone 8The announcements from MWC 2017 largely set the stage for the coming battle for smartphone supremacy. Samsung still must take the wraps off the Galaxy S8, but after that happens, we'll largely know what Apple's iPhone 8 will be up against.Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA) Will Try to Dominate IndiaIt looks like Apple's 10th anniversary iPhone will face a strong field with large displays, impressive cameras, Google Assistant on board and new designs - at least some of which follow the direction Apple is expected to take.Who will have the best smartphone of 2017?

Warren Buffett Has Boosted His Apple, Inc. Position Nearly Tenfold in 4 Months;2/27/2017;"Just a couple weeks ago, 13F filings started flowing in, andBerkshire Hathaway's(NYSE: BRK-A) (NYSE: BRK-B) ownership disclosures showed thatWarren Buffett nearly quadrupledhisApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) position in the fourth quarter. The Oracle of   Omaha closed out 2016 with approximately 57.4 million shares, up   from the 15.2 million shares that Berkshire Hathaway was holding   at the end of the third quarter.Well, it turns out that Buffett wasn't done loading up on   Apple. Not by a long shot.Berkshire Hathaway is now the single largest holder of   AppleIn aninterview with CNBCthis morning, Buffett shared some more about what Berkshire   Hathaway has been buying in the early innings of 2017. Spoiler   alert: even more Apple. Since the close of the fourth quarter   that's covered by the 13F, Buffett said that Berkshire continued   to buy shares up until earnings; Berkshire stopped buying shares   after earnings when shares jumped. Berkshiremore than doubledits Apple position during the month of January, and its total   holdings are now approximately 133 million shares, valued at   around $17 billion.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');While doubling an already large position over the course of a   month is already a pretty bullish signal to investors, it's even   more bullish when you compound that over a longer period of time.   As mentioned above, Berkshire finished the third quarter with   15.2 million shares, so a position of 133 million shares   represents a nearly tenfold increase in just 4 months.Data source: SEC filings and CNBC. Chart by author.Furthermore, shares are already up about 13% for February, so   Berkshire's Apple position continues to perform well, as shares   now trade at all-time highs.As famously averse to tech as Buffett is, it's just as well   known that he loves consistent cash flow. The Oracle notes that   the iPhone is incredibly sticky, and so many people have   integrated the device into their daily lives that it's become   indispensable. Apple customers are also incredibly loyal, so they   stick with the brand at a higher rate relative to other consumer   electronics companies. That all feeds back into cash flow, since   Apple is able to generate recurring hardware revenue with ongoing   product cycles.iPhone 7 with AirPods. Image source: Apple.At this point, Berkshire is the single largest holder of   Apple, with about a 2.5% stake in the company. The only companies   that hold more shares are fund companies like Vanguard and   Fidelity, among others, who aggregate their holdings across all   funds for reporting purposes. That includes passive funds and   ETFs that only hold Apple in order to track an underlying index,   although there are certainly some active funds in the mix as   well. For example, the single largest mutual fund holder of Apple   is theVanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund, a passive index fund that had 109.5 million shares at the end   of January (Apple is its largest holding).It's mildly ironic that an investor that's not into tech is   now the largest owner of the largest tech company.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

The Best Way to Beat the S&P 500;2/27/2017;"Investors use the Standard & Poor's index's performance to judge their own, and the Holy Grail is to outperform the index consistently.But what if I told you there was a way to outperform the index consistently by buying the index itself and doing almost no work for the additional gains?Sounds appealing and almost too good to be true.makeArticleAd();Well, it is true, and this technique is available to every investor.The reason this is possible is the way the S&P 500 is constructed. The index is computed by a weighted average market capitalization calculated by taking the number of shares outstanding of each company and multiplying the number by the company's current share price. This is a relatively lazy way of calculating an index and gives more weight to larger constituents and less weight to smaller companies so the index is disproportionately affected by a decline inApple(AAPL) compared to a smaller firm.OutdatedThis approach has worked well since the S&P 500's inception, but it isn't the best approach. Because small companies usually grow faster than their larger counterparts, it doesn't make much sense to give these companies a lower weighting in the index as it stunts their impact on the broader market. Surely, if small caps are given more weight, the index would perform better overall?That's exactly what the S&P 500 Equal Weight Index shows. The S&P 500 Equal Weight Index does what it says on the tin. The index gives each constituent an equal weight without taking into account market capitalization or other factors. The results of using this strategy have been extremely impressive. From 2003 through 2015, a $10,000 investment in the traditional S&P 500 index would have turned into $29,370. During that same period, the same investment in the S&P 500 Equal Weight Index would have turned into $38,866. Over the past five years, the S&P 500Equal Weight Index has returned 26.8% compared to the traditional S&P 500's return of 23.3%.What's behind the outperformance?There is a belief that the reason why equal weighted indexes outperform traditional market capitalization weighted peers is due to the weighting of small caps in the index. However, according to research conducted by Robert Ferguson and David Schofield, senior investment officer and president of Intech International, there is another reason why equal weight indexes tend to outperform over the long term.They believe the outperformance of equal weighted indexes has more to do with the index's constituent rebalancing than anything else. For example, to maintain required equal weights, the index provider has to sell a stock after a recent run higher but also buy more of a company if it has drastically underperformed over a set period. Put simply this trading requirement creates a ""buy low sell high"" trading strategy, which is both contrarian and momentum chasing.Ferguson and Schofield go on to note that surprisingly the underlying alpha source is always positive for such indicators, which is another indication that excess return has something to do with volatility. Equal-weighted indexes have a higher tracking error over time relative to the capitalization weighted index. The reason why this is the case lies in diversity.Diversity is at its maximum if all stock capitalizations are equal. Changes in diversity influence relative return of the equal-weighted portfolio. As the capital distribution curve has a typical shape, diversity must have a typical value with no long term trend. In this case, the influence due to changes in diversity will be close to zero over time, and the outperformance of the equal-weighted portfolio will be close to its volatility-based source, which is necessarily positive (stock returns can be both positive and negative, but volatility is always positive).When the effects of diversity are combined with contrarian/momentum investing, the equal weight index can capture higher alpha and less severe underperformance periods.Disclosure:The author owns no stock mentioned.Start afree seven-day trialof Premium Membership to GuruFocus.GILD 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of GILDPeter Lynch Chart of GILDPremium MembersThis article first appeared onGuruFocus."

Warren Buffett On Active vs. Passive Investing, Outlines 'The Bet' In Berkshire Shareholder Letter;2/27/2017;"Warren Buffett, billionaire fundamental investor and CEO of Berkshire HathawayBRK.B, released his annual report to shareholders outlining ""The Bet"". Nine years ago, Mr. Buffett publicly bet that any set of five hedge funds could not outperform the S&P 500 index over a 10 year period of time; hedge funds charge high active management fees while the S&P 500 index is invested in through low cost index funds. Ted Seides, co-manager of Protégé Partners, stepped up to the plate against Mr. Buffett.Mr. Seides chose five funds-of-funds, which invest in a variety of hedge funds, and Mr. Buffett decided on a Vanguard S&P 500 index fund. The wager counted performance net of fees, costs and expenses which boils down Mr. Buffett's thesis of his bet: passive investing will outperform active management in the long run because costs strip away high performance possibilities.Sure enough, to date, Mr. Buffett is ahead in the race and declared victory. The wager began on January 1, 2008 and will end on December 31, 2017.  Through 2016, the compounded annual increase for the Vanguard index fund is 7.1% and only an average of 2.2% for the five funds-of-funds.In his letter, Mr. Buffett writes, ""The bottom line: When trillions of dollars are managed by Wall Streeters charging high fees, it will usually be the managers who reap outsized profits, not the clients.""It is important to note that Mr. Buffett is not saying it is impossible to outperform the market. He prides himself on his ability to pick winning investments over losing investments. What Mr. Buffett is pointing to is that most active managers will fail; he states that more than $100 billion have been drained into bad investment advice in the past 10 years.Berkshire Hathaway never commits to holding a security, says Mr. Buffett. ""It is true that we own stock that I have no intention of selling…But we have made no commitment that Berkshire will hold any of its marketable securities forever,"" he wrote in his letter. There are positions which have been held onto for years such as Wells FargoWFC, American ExpressAXP, and Coca-ColaKO. However, for example, in 2016 Berkshire Hathaway bought large stakes in AppleAAPLand sold a majority of their stake in Wal-MartWMTin an active charge to find yield.Wall Street shows that investors are leaning towards low cost index funds over active managers who promise to beat the market.The Wall Street Journalwrites that last year, investors pulled a net $342.4 billion out of active managers' hands and poured a record $505.6 billion into passively managed funds.Mr. Buffett's advice: it is best for investors to use low cost index funds rather than handing their assets to active managers who charge high fees. ""Both large and small investors should stick with low-cost index funds,"" he says.A Full-Blown Technological Breakthrough in the   MakingZacks' Aggressive Growth Strategist Brian Bolan explores autonomous cars in our latest Special Report, Driverless Cars: Your Roadmap to Mega-Profits Today.

Applied Materials (AMAT): Why Investors Should Include It In Their Portfolio;2/27/2017;"Applied Materials, Inc.(AMAT)is the world's largest maker of semiconductor and display manufacturing equipment. It is impossible to pick up an electronic product from top brands and not have something inside that Applied Materials helped made. The company is not only a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), but it also has a Style Score of 'B' and multiple positive earnings estimates in the past 30 days. Below, I take a detailed look at Applied Materials' Style Scores and impressive earning estimates.ValueApplied Materials' stock trades at a PE of 13.88, compared to its industry, which has an average PE of 16.58. This means that Applied Materials is trading at a relative discount to its industry peers. It is reasonable to say that companies in this industry are decent choices for value investors but that Applied Materials is even better. No wonder, Applied Materials has a Style Score of 'B' for Value, especially with a PEG of just 0.9, which means the stock is currently cheap from an earnings growth perspective, too.GrowthApplied Material isn't just a great value choice, as it also has some interesting growth metrics as well. Also scoring a 'B' for its Growth Style Score, the company's projected earnings per share growth is at 47.67%, which crushes the industry average of 17.15%. Analysts also projected Applied Materials' sales growth to be 22.46%, which is easily ahead of the industry - coming in at 14.78%, again.Earnings EstimatesIn the past 30 days, Applied Materials has seen eight positive estimate revisions for the current quarter, compared to none lower. According toZacks Equity Research, the earnings estimate for the current quarter has also been favorable, with estimates rising from $0.62 a share 30 days ago to $0.76 per share today, a move of 22.6%.Promising OutlookApplied Materials is expecting a profitable second quarter in fiscal 2017 from their outstanding performance in the last two quarters. Not only did Applied Materials report record profit of $1.72 billion in the fourth quarter ending in October of fiscal 2016, but the company also reported record orders of $4.24 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. The company sees the second quarter of 2017 as another opportunity to set new records.Revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 rose by 45% year-over-year and is expected to grow even more as China looks to strengthen and expand its own chip and advanced panel industry. Applied Materials controls a large share of the market in China, as reported byNikkei Asian Review. Gary Dickerson, CEO and President of Applied Materials, said 2017 annual revenue in China would reach $2.6 billion.""I've never been so positive about our core businesses, and our position has never been better in our market,"" Dickerson toldNikkeireporters in Taipei on Wednesday. ""I am very excited about the near term and very excited about our future long term.""The major products that are helping the company's growth are the global demand of 3-D NAND flash memory chips and advanced organic light-emitting diode (OLED). The memory chips are used in a broad range of electronics such as laptops and mobile devices. OLED is considered a popular option for premium smartphones since Apple Inc.(AAPL)adopted them for the iPhone that's scheduled for release later this year.Bottom LineWith high demands and customers from around the world including Intel(INTC), Samsung Electronics, Toshiba, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.(TSM)and Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., Applied Materials is looking to be a powerhouse in its industry.The company expects net sales in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 to be in the range of $3.45 billion to $3.6 billion, which at the midpoint of the range will be approximately 44% growth year over year. With a record of consistently beating our consensus earnings estimate and positive growth in revenues and new orders, Applied Materials should be on your radar now if it's not already.A Full-Blown Technological Breakthrough in the   MakingZacks' Aggressive Growth Strategist Brian Bolan explores autonomous cars in our latest Special Report, Driverless Cars: Your Roadmap to Mega-Profits Today.

Get Paid to Trade International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) Stock;2/27/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsI have not been a fan ofInternational Business Machines Corp.(NYSE:IBM) for a long time. It is my opinion that management was slow to shift cash cows. They lost their way and have yet to recover. They have been trying to carve a niche in artificial intelligence, but that story has been over a decade in the making. To use a poker term, they are pot-committed to AI.makeArticleAd();Luckily, artificial intelligence has seen a recent resurgence in popularity so the wait may actually pay off to IBM longs.Experts are in awe of what Watson can do. Unfortunately, its profit stream is taking too long to develop. IBM is no longer the sure long-term bet it once was. To me, it more resembles a startup with a cool product still finding its way.Click to EnlargeUsually, I like to sell longer-dated risk in companies that I believe are long-term winners likeAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) orApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL). In this case, I am putting my trust in the IBM price action more so than its fundamentals.The Bet:Sell the IBM Oct $130 put. This is a bullish trade for which I collect $1.40 per contract to open. This trade has a 90% theoretical chance of success. This sounds like a great idea now, but it comes with risk. By selling the put naked, I am committing to buying the stock at $130 per share if IBM falls below it. Anything below $128.60 per share would accrue losses for me.The 7 Best ETFs for Retirement InvestorsSelling naked puts is not suited for most investors, so I can modify the trade to make it more attainable.The Alternate:Sell IBM $140/$135 credit put spread. This also is a bullish trade, but one with a finite risk profile. I collect 40 cents per contract to open. The 22% price buffer is smaller than that of selling the $130 naked put but for the finite risk profile advantage.While 40 cents may sound too little, it would represent an 8% yield on money risked and for the high chance of success it carries it should elate most investors.I chose longer-dated risk so I don't have to fret the short-term gyrations. I find that longer-dated options risk is easier to manage. Also, I can close either of these trades at any time for partial gains or losses.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director ofSellSpreads.com.

These 2 High-Yield Dividend Stocks Are Ridiculously Cheap;2/26/2017;"Many dividend investors search for companies that have fat   yields and trade for an attractive valuation. Of course,   companies with high dividend yields can be risky, so potential   owners need to be quite picky about which stocks they choose to   buy.Let's take a closer look at two stocks --Spark Energy(NASDAQ: SPKE) andGameStop(NYSE: GME)  -- that both have above-average yields and low   valuations. Is either stock worth buying?Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();A different energy choiceMany consumers who live in deregulated energy markets might be   surprised to learn they have a choice of electricity and gas   providers. Spark Energy is one of the many independent   retail energy-services companies in the country that offers a   competing choice.Spark Energy isn't an energy producer. It buys energy and gas   on the wholesale market and resells it to consumers at retail   prices. The company claims that switching to its service in   many cases can help its customers save money.While persuading customers to make the switch can be tough,   Spark has been in rapid growth mode over the past few years,   thanks to its healthy appetite for acquisitions. Since its 2014   IPO, it has completed seven acquisitions, which has helped   consistently drive its top line higher. When combined with the   company's generous dividend policy -- Spark's current yield is   5.7% -- shareholders have seen significant value   creation.SPKE Total Return Pricedata byYChartsGiven that the retail energy-services market is highly   fragmented, Spark appears to help plenty of room left to expand.   With shares trading for about 9 times forward earnings, the   numbers suggest that this could be a home-run investment in the   making.However, while all of Spark's numbers look great, there are a   few warning signs. For one, companies that grow by acquisition   are notoriously difficult to understand, since their   financial statements are always changing. That makes them   difficult to value, and it can be easy for management to hide   internal problems. In addition, Spark has received a lot of   terrible reviews on sites such asYelpand the Better Business Bureau, from customers who claim the   company used high-pressure sales techniques to get them to switch   and who then saw their energy bills rise. Finally, with more than   42% of the company's publicly available shares having been   shorted, a lot of money managers are betting big against this   company.A retailer in transitionJust as in the DVD and music business, video-game consumers   are gradually shifting away from buying physical products and   looking toward digital channels to get their fix. That trend has   been a thorn in the side of   video-game retailer GameStop over the past few   years. The increasing popularity of digital games has created   less of a need to visit one of the company's stores, putting   downward pressure on its sales. Management has admitted that the   trend is here to stay and has projected a slow but steady decline   in its legacy business.However, there are reasons to believe that the decline won't   be as steep as you'd first expect. Cutting-edge video games for   the PlayStation 4 or Xbox One can sometimes require up to 40   gigabytes of storage space to play, which is many multiples   higher than video or music files. That's one reason digital   penetration of high-quality video games still remains relatively   low. In addition, digital games can't be resold the way physical   games can. That provides an incentive for gamers to continue to   visit GameStop's stores.Meanwhile, GameStop is looking for other ways to drive sales   growth. The company has created its own digital gaming   platform that currently rings up more than $1 billion in digital   sales. Management is also making a move into the collectible   space through its acquisition of ThinkGeek, and sales are growing   quickly. In fact, management believes that this business could   hit $1 billion in revenue by 2019.Finally, GameStop is pushing hard into the mobile and   computing market with its Spring Mobile and Simply   Mac concepts. These stores are leading authorized resellers   of products fromAT&TandApple. Believe it or not, these new sales channels are expected to   drive modest earningsgrowthover the next five years.Still, many investors are worried that this strategy shift   won't work in the long run and have priced GameStop's shares   accordingly. The company is trading for less the ridiculously   cheap price of 7 times forward earnings, and its dividend yield   has been pushed above 5.6%. More than 27% of the company's   publicly available stock has been sold sort, which tells you how   little faith the markets have in this company.Is either worth buying?While Spark offers investors a high yield, the potential for   growth, and a cheap valuation, I see too many warning signs to be   willing to put money into the stock. GameStop, on the other hand,   is also a high-risk bet, but the company is still highly   profitable and appears to have a realistic plan in place for   slowly turning its fortunes around. That makes me think GameStop   might be the better bet for daring investors.10 stocks we like better than GameStopWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Since some wireless carriers   require CDMA support, Apple couldn't completely abandon Qualcomm   in the iPhone.""We believe CDMA support was a gating issue in winning the   majority of iPhone 7 sockets, as select global carriers require   the standard,"" Rolland writes.The analyst then says if Apple were to ditch Qualcomm   completely in favor of Intel modems, it would lead to a $1.1   billion to $1.4 billion reduction in Qualcomm's revenue and a   drop of between $0.25 and $0.35 per share in earnings.Intel, the analyst says, could stand to see revenue grow by   between $800 million and $1.1 billion from such a switch, with   earnings per share growing between $0.06 and $0.08.There's little doubt that having a CDMA-capable modem only   helps Intel and hurts Qualcomm as it relates to the iPhone, but I   don't think it's realistic to expect Apple to fully ditch   Qualcomm. Here's why.Two suppliers are better than oneThere are good reasons to have multiple suppliers for critical   components. Having multiple suppliers helps to guard against   potential execution problems on the part of a single supplier,   such as supply issues and product-quality issues.To be blunt, Qualcomm's track record with respect to cellular   modem advancements is impeccable; Intel's execution, meanwhile,   seems to have improved solidly over the years, but it's still not   a good idea to bet the iPhone on Intel.Beyond risk mitigation, though, having multiple competent   suppliers in the mix improves the buyer's ability to negotiate   prices to its benefit.Remember, until Intel announced the XMM 7560, Apple   essentially had one company from which it could buy CDMA-capable   LTE modems -- Qualcomm. So if Apple wanted to sell phones   compatible with networks that required CDMA support, it needed to   buy chips from Qualcomm -- period.Moreover, in a recent lawsuit that Apple filed against   Qualcomm, the former claims the latter charged Apple a   ""monopolistic premium"" for cellular modems with CDMA support,   even though those chips were ""in all other respects identical to   the chipsets sold to Apple without CDMA functionality   enabled.""If Apple had previously had multiple supplier options for   CDMA-capable LTE modems, Qualcomm might not have been able to get   away with charging such a premium.So by having both Qualcomm and Intel in the mix supplying   modems that are, for all intents and purposes, interchangeable,   Apple should be able to lower its component costs and ultimately   either boost its gross profit margins or redirect the savings to   adding more features to future iPhone models.Qualcomm may see lower allocationThough I don't think it's likely for Qualcomm to lose all the   iPhone business, I could see Qualcomm's share at Apple come down.   Further, I could see Qualcomm's average selling prices of the   chips that it does sell to Apple coming down from where they   would have otherwise been if Intel weren't on the verge of   releasing a CDMA-capable modem.The situation doesn't look great for Qualcomm, and it looks   pretty good for Intel, but in the scheme of both companies'   respective consolidated revenues, this just isn't a potential   game changer for either one.10 stocks we like better than QualcommWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

3 Horrendously Bad Stock Market Predictions From Otherwise Smart People;2/26/2017;"""It's tough to make predictions, especially about the future.""-- Yogi BerramakeArticleAd();Every year, the stock market either advances, declines, or stays flat. It's never clear beforehand which direction these indexes, or the stocks that comprise them, will move; the reasons for their price swings only make sense in retrospect.But that truth doesn't stop people from making aggressive predictions attempting to identify the Next Big Thing or to call a coming crash or boom. Here are a few classic examples of some smart market watchers getting burned by their stock calls.1. McDonald's will trounce Google as an investmentWhitney Tilsonhas used his value investing approach to produce awesome returns for himself and his investors over the years. Yet his tendency to bash ""expensive"" companies with high price-to-earnings ratios has also burned the hedge fund giant -- big time.For example, back in 2004, Tilson made abold prediction. Writing for The Motley Fool at the time, he said the soon-to-be-publicAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) (a.k.a. Google) would almost certainly flame out as a business. ""I'd wager that odds are at least 90% that its profit margins and growth rate will be materially lower five years from now,"" he argued.Tilson got even more specific, saying thatMcDonald's(NYSE: MCD) would make a much better bet given its far lower valuation. ""I believe that it is virtually certain that Google's stock will be highly disappointing to investors foolish enough to participate in its overhyped offering -- you can hold me to that,"" he concluded.GOOGL Market Capdata byYCharts.So how did that prediction pan out? Since 2005, Alphabet shares are up roughly 16 times, compared to less than a 400% return for the fast food titan. The search engine giant produced nearly $20 billion of net income last year, versus McDonald's $4.5 billion. Today, Alphabet is worth almost six times McDonald's in the eyes of the market.2. Smartphones will be a bustA deep understanding of technology isn't enough to protect you from being surprised by major shifts in the industry. Andrew Grove was one of the founders ofIntel, which profoundly shaped the semiconductor industry. He wasTime Magazine's Man of The Year in 1997. Yet in 1992 he made a prediction that looks amazingly shortsighted in retrospect.Image source: Getty Images.ANew York Timesarticledescribed Grove as standing diametrically opposed to the position taken byApple(NASDAQ: AAPL)  that smartphones, then imagined as ""personal communicators,"" might develop into a huge business. They'd be ""the mother of all markets,"" according to Apple's then-CEO, John Sculley.Grove disagreed. The idea of a communicating device that people carried around with them is ""a pipe dream driven by greed,"" he said. Ironically, the article lists a few predictions about the technology that proved prescient. These personal communicators might handle emails, use GPS to map directions, and even allow someone to ""order pizza using a combination of custom electronic forms and wireless fax.""Today, the smartphone industry is massive, with Apple accounting for nearly 150 million iPhone sales in the past year. These devices helped spur over $24 billion of complementary service-based revenue, which demonstrates that, if anything, investors weren't being greedy enough about the potential for smartphones to find a huge market.3. The Dow is headed to 36,000James Glassman's 1999 book titledDow 36,000hasn't aged well. In fact, Washington Post economics columnist Neil Irwincalled it""perhaps the most spectacularly wrong investing book ever"" given that it forecast a massive rally for stocks between 1999 and 2004.Glassman's timing couldn't have been worse. The Dow hit 14,000 the year his book published before plummeting to a 15-year low of 7,000 in 2009. A roaring rally has pushed the blue-chip index back to new highs recently, but today it's still 42% below the mark he believed the Dow would achieve over a decade ago.^DJIdata byYCharts.To his credit, Glassman has taken a hard look at how his prediction could have been so far off the mark. He identified two major factors thathe and his co-author missed: earnings growth and the attitude of investors as reflected in the price-to-earnings multiples they are willing to pay for stocks. Neither trend went in the direction they had targeted.A better wayThese failed forecasts illustrate how overconfidence can prove fatal to your portfolio while predictions about economic trends are rarely more than a distraction from the business of accumulating stock market returns.Bold predictions are compelling because they attract debate and can pay big dividends if proven correct. But no one knows which direction stocks or markets will move over the short term. That's why investors are better off simply buying a diverse group of solid stocks and holding on to the shares for years (or decades) while allowing the power of compound returns to do all of the hard work.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

3 Great Stocks for Your Roth IRA;2/25/2017;"One of the best retirement vehicles investors can take   advantage of is aRoth IRA-- which is similar to a traditional IRA except that the money   put in is already taxed, so that when the account owner needs to   pull it out later on, they can do so without paying taxes on   those earnings and withdrawals. Limits on Roth IRAs are strict;   in 2017, most investors can contribute just $5,500, but once that   money is in there, where should it go?For those looking for individual stocks that could make for   great long-term Roth IRA holdings, here's whyApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) ,Starbucks(NASDAQ: SBUX) , andWalt Disney Co.(NYSE: DIS) could be prime targets.makeArticleAd();AppleApple has a lot going for it with a great track record of   generating market-beating returns while remaining robust enough   to be very stable amid market or regional corrections. The iPhone   still makes up the largest chunk of the company's sales, and the   well-performing iPhone 7 showed that the company has plenty of   power left in that product -- and its future iterations -- for   continued growth.Image source: Apple Inc.Apple is also working to grow not only its personal computer   and other smaller segments, but especially its services segment,   which includes revenue from services such as iTunes, iCloud, and   Apple Pay, and it grew sales 18% year over year to $7.2 billion   (just under 10% of total sales) in fiscal 2017 Q1 ended Dec. 31.   When it comes to long-term future growth drivers, Apple is   betting on areas like home artificial intelligence, autonomous   driving, and likely many areas the public doesn't know about   yet.The company has a whopping nearly $240 billion cash pile,   making it by farthe wealthiest company in the U.S., and in fiscal year 2016, Apple increased its research and   development spending by about 25% to $10 billion -- a good sign   of exciting announcements to come in 2017 or the years to   come. Finally, there's Apple's valuation. The stock   currently trades at just 16 times earnings -- only 13 times   forward earnings estimates -- making it one of the cheapest tech   stocks you could find for such a well-performing company.StarbucksThe joke that there's a Starbucks on every corner has been   around for a long time -- the clip below from the popular TV show   ""The Simpsons"" is from an episode that's nearly 20 years   old. And yet, the company continues to announce ambitious   plans for store count growth. In the most recent earnings report,   Starbucks had a total of 25,734 locations open   worldwide, with another 12,000 in the pipeline over the   next four years alone. A new Starbucks is currently opening in   China every 15 hours, according to management.Starbucks continues to be a remarkable branding story, and   that's especially true in regions like China, where it's growing   its presence and prestige among younger generations there.   However, it's not just that the company has a history of   continued store growth with plenty of open space for more   development, but it's proven to be a shrewd operator with   increased efficiency to draw more and more profits from its   stores.For the recently announced fiscal 2017 Q1, Starbucks reported   an 11% rise in EPS year over year, and it expects a similar   result for full-year 2017. Starbucks' massively successful   loyalty program and the company's willingness to continually try   new initiatives like new high-end Reserve chains point to   this company's ability to continue to dominate in its market and   reward investors for many years to come.Image source: Walt Disney Co.Walt Disney Co.Disney stockhas been on an impressive run lately, up 22% in the last four   months. Still, that follows the company spending most of 2016 out   of Wall Street's favor, falling from its high of around $120 in   November 2015 to below $90 in early 2016. The stock is still down   about 9% from its 2015 high, but it could be prepared for much   higher long-term gains.Disney has multiple growth avenues ahead, including the most   obvious of continuing to pump out record-setting movies within   its tentpole franchises like Star Wars and Marvel, and also   original hits that the company proves it's apt to keep doing.   Other avenues for growth, such as its successful theme park   segment, which is likely to grow more in 2017 with the first full   year of the new Shanghai Disney Resort open and the recent   announcement that Disney is slightly raising ticket prices at its   U.S. theme parks, continue to bode well for the company's future   earnings as well.Trading at just 19 times earnings and only 16 times   forward-looking earnings for next year's estimates, Disney stock   looks plenty cheap now, including a small but growing dividend,   solid balance sheet, and strong operating cash growth. Add that   to the fact that the company grew diluted earnings per share 17%   year over year in fiscal year 2016 and is expected to   grow earnings per share 10% on average in each of the next   five years, and the stock -- just like Apple and Starbucks --   looks like a great value for a long-term-focused Roth IRA.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Tech Most Popular Sector for Investment Fund Managers in 2017;2/24/2017;"Data show that Silicon Valley darlings once again captured the interest of stock fund managers looking to cash in on the sector's growth and dreams in the fourth quarter of 2016.In a ranking of the 20 S&P 500 stocks that U.S. funds managing more than $1 million bought the most, tech companies took eight spots: Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL), Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Cisco (CSCO), Alphabet (GOOG) and Intel (INTC). Microsoft and Apple also saw the most buying in the S&P 500, according to data compiled by GuruFocus.The results show U.S. investment fund managers packing into a market sector that already sprinted through last year, gaining 23.5% in 2016 versus 9.54% in the S&P 500. So far, it has not broken a sweat going into 2017, rising 29.49% year to date versus 5.58% in the S&P 500. Only one sector has outperformed it, financials, which rose 44.90% year to date on the back of investor optimism in future tax cuts and interest rate hikes.makeArticleAd();Some research indicates investors can expect further growth for tech. Global information company The NPD Group forecasts 2% growth in technology industry sales in 2017 from 2016, driven by innovation, new products and low prices. A gaggle of fresh product categories is also slated to lure more buyers, like drones, virtual reality and home automation products, in addition to seasoned products like TVs and PCs in the premium space.For just one product, drones, NPD researchers anticipate 177% in sales growth from 2016 to 2018, led mainly by hobbyists. Less tech-savvy consumers may also begin to get on board with smart home devices, where NPD predicts 80% growth over the same period.Other megatrends continue down the pipeline, like cloud computing, big dada and artificial intelligence, but some market watchers see reason for worry.""Looking at the other side of these favorable long-term trends, I remain wary of certain hardware companies whose products are becoming commoditized. For example, in the personal computer market, virtual reality headsets and computers are an opportunity for growth, but so far, demand has been largely anemic,"" said one analyst, Charlie Chai of Fidelity in a sector outlook.""""The smart-device market is increasingly saturated and lacks products capable of driving sustainable new excitement. On the enterprise hardware front, there continue to be many technology disruptions, which increase the long-term risks for some incumbents. Although valuations are generally low for enterprise hardware companies, I continue to struggle with their challenging long-term outlooks.""Employment momentum has carried over into 2017, indicating companies see these opportunities expanding. The tech industry added a net 9,000 jobs in the IT sector in January, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The highest employment growth occurred in software and technology services where 12,500 jobs were added, extending growth of 73,900 jobs in 2016, despite layoffs at numerous companies.Earnings growth has supported tech's rally. Of the 408 companies that had reported earnings as of Feb. 17, tech led all sectors with a 12.1% increase year over year, amounting to an additional $68.2 billion. Eight of the 11 sectors were expected to finish the quarter with improved earnings, according to Thomson Reuters. Yet when removing sub-industries with the highest growth, semiconductor equipment and electronic manufacturing services, the growth rate declines to 11.1%, more in line with financials and utilities.The S&P North American tech sector index had a trailing price-earnings ratio of 28.07 and projected price-earnings ratio of 20.47 as of Jan. 31. It also had a price-book ratio of 4.92%, price-free cash flow ratio of 16.52 and dividend yield of 1.21%. Its largest constituents are Apple, Microsoft, Facebook and Alphabet.Microsoft, favorite of most U.S. funds, grew fourth-quarter revenue 1.23%, operating earnings 2.5% and earnings 3.62% from the prior-year quarter, on the strength of cloud and office products and services. Personal computing fell 5% primarily by a drop in gaming revenue and its feature phone business, which it sold in November. During the quarter, the company returned $6.5 billion to shareholders in share repurchases and dividends.Donald Yacktman(Trades,Portfolio)'sYacktman Fund(Trades, Portfolio)s commented on the company in its recent letter, ""Microsoft's shares were solid contributors to fourth-quarter results as the company continues its remarkable transformation under CEO Satya Nadella. Microsoft could be a significant beneficiary of the new administration's proposed tax repatriation plan.""The biggest guru investor in Microsoft is Jeff Ubben (Trades, Portfolio), who has 19.71% of his reported portfolio in the company.Apple's performance also shined in most categories, with all-time sales record for its iPhone, services, Mac and Apple Watch. Fourth-quarter revenue rose 3.19%, and EPS increased 2.44% to an all-time high. Earnings for the company struggled, though, falling 2.62% year over year, as net and gross margins declined. Apple returned $15 billion to investors in share repurchases and dividends during the quarter. CEO Tim Cook also hinted at ""products in our pipeline.""A guru Apple shareholder, David Rolfe (Trades, Portfolio), commented in his Wedgewood Partners recent letter, ""Clearly the Company does not need to spend $10-$15 billion per year to sustain the evolutionary upgrades to the iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch and/or new video streaming services. Apple's nascent automotive program Project Titan may not be at all about creating a complete autonomous driving car (Apple Car), but rather the creation of software that makes existing cars smarter - or even autonomous. Now that is a huge, creatively disruptive opportunity.""Apple's top guru shareholder is David Einhorn (Trades, Portfolio), whose Greenlight Capital has 11.56% of its assets in his reported long portfolio in the stock. Another famous shareholder, Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio), owns 1.09% of Apple's shares, which make up 4.49% of Berkshire's portfolio. He added more than 42 million shares of the company in the fourth quarter.See more of fund manager's favorite S&P 500 stocks of the recent quarter here.Premium MembersThis article first appeared onGuruFocus."

Texas Instruments vs. Skyworks: Which Semiconductor Stock Should You Buy?;2/24/2017;"After a short period of post-election uncertainty, the technology sector rebounded with a strong fourth quarter earnings season. Within this broad sector, the semiconductor industry has been one of the best performers this year, and it is clear that demand for chips is high in a variety of different areas.While we are seeing strength throughout the semiconductor industry, it has been the traditional giants that have really impressed investors recently. Companies like Skyworks SolutionsSWKShave garnered impressive momentum, while behemoths like Texas InstrumentsTXNlook poised to continue growing thanks to changing consumer behavior.By taking a look at what is driving the semiconductor industry right now and familiarizing ourselves with the recent performance of these stocks, we can make a more educated decision on whether Texas Instruments or Skyworks is the better fit for your portfolio.The State of SemiconductorsIt is always important to consider the impact that mobile phones have on the semiconductor industry, as some companies-such as Skyworks-depend on supplying companies like AppleAAPLfor a solid chunk of their revenue.However, newer demands like the Internet of Things (IoT) and driverless vehicles have opened up growth areas for these semiconductor giants. Our world is becoming increasingly connected and semiconductor companies stand to benefit.IoT technology promises to connect our household and commercial items to a wireless network in order to make our lives easier. This could mean the remote operation of a house's security system, or it could mean manufacturers instantly tracking the performance of their machines. Either way, semiconductor companies are the ones making the electronic and sensor technologies (also read:How to Invest in the ""Internet of Things"").We are also seeing a similar situation play out within the car. Sure, fully autonomous cars are still a few years away from being commercially available, but the new ""connected car"" is very much a modern-day reality. Over the past few years, driving has evolved into an experience that now incorporates several new technologies to promote better comfort and safety. This has been another key growth area for semiconductors.Right now, the Semiconductor-General industry sits in the Top 6% of the Zacks Industry Rank, which really highlights the strength of this business.TXN vs. SWKSAs we jump into the head-to-head comparison between Texas Instruments and Skyworks, let's check out a few key stats from both companies:TXNSWKSZacks Rank#1 (Strong Buy)#2 (Buy)VGM ScoreBAP/E Ratio21.0216.39Current Quarter Est. Revisions111Avg. Surprise (Trailing Four Quarters)7.09%2.65%Proj. EPS Growth9.86%12.71%YTD % Price Change5.84%29.53%Simply put, there are several indicators of strength for both of these stocks right now. Skyworks is interesting because of its impressive VGM grade of ""A,"" as well as its incredible momentum so far this year. The stock has significantly outpaced the S&P 500, and despite its size, the company is still growing earnings at a solid rate.Texas Instruments is also displaying some strong metrics. The company has seen a flurry of positive estimate revisions following its most recent earnings report and guidance. It's also impressive to see a company that was founded in the 50s still able to grow earnings at nearly a double-digit rate. Of course, Texas Instruments also has a bit of an edge as it currently sits at a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), just edging out Skyworks' Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).What's WorkingThe reason why both of these companies are positioned so strongly right now is that they have both been targeting these previously discussed high-growth areas.While Apple still accounts for about 40% of Skyworks' quarterly revenue, the company has actively targeted the IoT market. During the most recent quarter, Skyworks won contracts from multiple Tier 1 original equipment manufacturers, and the company has been open about its belief that IoT, connected cars, and 5G will be significant growth drivers.Texas Instruments has a similar perspective, and the company seems to have an even further focus on cars. ""Revenue increased 7 percent from the same quarter a year ago, as demand for our products remained strong in the automotive market,"" noted CEO Rich Templeton, before stating that personal electronics demand was down slightly.Times are very much changing, and the consumer electronics market is quite different than it was just a few years ago. But that doesn't mean semiconductor makers are struggling. In fact, the companies that have successfully adapted to these changes are thriving.Stocks that Aren't in the News.

How Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock Can Squeeze $26B From LinkedIn;2/24/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIt's been six weeks sinceMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) closed its $26.5 billion acquisition of LinkedIn, the largest deal ever made by the Seattle tech giant. Since the acquisition was announced in June 2016, there have been plenty of opinions surrounding the steep price paid for the business networking site - somepositive, somenegative- and those question marks will continue to follow Microsoft and MSFT stock until LinkedIn is able to pay its own way.makeArticleAd();Source:Mike Mozart Via FlickrI'm a fan of Microsoft stock - in late December,I predicted it would hit $80 in 2017- so I'm definitely rooting for LinkedIn to keep delivering the goods as it did in its Q3 2016 earnings, its last report as an independent company.Its$1.18 earnings per shareon a non-GAAP basis - 27 cents higher than what analysts were expecting - on $960 million in revenue was a major victory for LinkedIn which also saw memberships grow 18% to 467 million compared to the same quarter a year earlier. Most important, it actually made a small GAAP profit of $9.1 million in the quarter.MSFT is on a roll, but it will have to maintain momentum if it's going to have any chance of extracting future shareholder value of $26.5 billion or more over the next few years.Sure, the LinkedIn acquisition is about more than money, but ultimately that's one of the key criteria for evaluating a deal's success or failure.7 Blue-Chip Stocks That Are Flush With CashHere are the three things I believe will make the LinkedIn acquisition a success.Estimated Monthly UsersWhile LinkedIn is considered the top social media site for business networking, it has just 106 million monthly active users (MAU) out of 467 million members.Facebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) has almost 18 times that, with its1.86 billion MAU.Microsoft might have plans for LinkedIn that go beyond its user numbers but it's got to keep pushing the MAU metric higher because Facebook's not going to stop growing its user base, especially when it comes to helping people find and secure new jobs.LinkedIn isn't going to capture anyone but the high-income segment of the workforce; currently, 45% of those earning more than $75,000 use LinkedIn. That's got to be higher.Mobile Is KeyNielsen's2016 Social Media Reportreleased in January offered a really deep dive into the world of social media including mobile usage. Drawing data from 9,000 smartphone users 18 or older, Nielsen was able to determine the number of unique mobile users for the top 10 social media platforms; Facebook had 178.2 million unique users compared to 60.1 million for LinkedIn or just three times the number.If LinkedIn wants to capture a bigger social media audience, especially younger business professionals, it's going to have to get very smart about its mobile game plan which it appears to have done delivering a revamped mobile site in 2016.""We are seeing good results with the core experience, with our revamped mobile app driving significant engagement growth in 2016,"" Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said during the company's Q2 2017 conference call. ""This quarter, the sessions on LinkedIn grew more than 20% year over year, a consistent level of growth throughout 2016. We also achieved record levels of mobile page view.""LinkedIn TalentThe best thing Microsoft has done to date regarding its purchase of LinkedIn ispromoting Kevin Scottto chief technology officer for the entire company. That suggests that Microsoft didn't just buy a great networking site but also got a lot of talented people including Scott, who, in addition to his existing roles at LinkedIn will lead Microsoft's technology plans as well.As CTO, Scott will be empowered to continue to help grow Microsoft's cloud business by bringing it together with LinkedIn's network of professionals. Analysts see Microsoft's cloud businessgrowing by 33%annually over the next three years and accounting for 30% of Microsoft's overall revenue by the end of fiscal 2019.Apple Inc. vs. Alphabet Inc: Value or Growth?Often, when companies merge, the two businesses have vastly different corporate cultures creating turf wars between the different organizations. While early in the transition it appears that Nadella is very concerned about successfully integrating the LinkedIn team.Should this attitude remain, Microsoft's got a great chance at reaping the rewards necessary to recoup its investment.Bottom Line on MSFT StockObviously, it's way too early to assess the success or failure of the LinkedIn acquisition.However, looking back at the last five fiscal years, LinkedIn's best showing in terms of profitability was in 2012 when it had $56.9 million in operating profits on $972.3 million in revenue for an operating margin of 5.9%.If Microsoft can get LinkedIn to that operating margin within five years, it will be generating approximately $354 million in operating profits on $6 billion in revenue (15% CAGR), a good start on the way to repaying the $26.5 billion.These three points will certainly help.As of this writing, Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceThe 7 Best ETFs for Retirement InvestorsApple Inc.

Will Apple Be Able to Drive Taiwan ETFs Higher?;2/24/2017;"Taiwan stocks seem to have the wind at their back. The country's equity market touched the highest level sinceMay 2015in mid-February. A pickup in economic growth bolstered by higher demand for electronics, Trump's conformity to 'One China' policy toward Taiwan and a recent run in Apple shares led to the gains.Taiwan ETFiShares MSCI Taiwan CappedEWTis up 11.5% so far this year (as of February 22, 2017). The economy has raked in about $2.5 billion in foreign investment this year, the highest compared with any big economy in Asia, as per Bloomberg (seeAsia-Pacific (Developed) ETFs).Why Is Apple Important to Taiwan?Theappeal of Taiwanese technology companies seems to be the main reason for the surge. Taiwanese semiconductor companies like Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC) and Hon Hai caught attention for manufacturing equipment for the likes of AppleAAPL, Sony and Nokia.Now that Apple shares are hitting all-time highs almost on a regular basis, courtesy of upbeat earnings result and the hype around the upcoming iPhone 8, Taiwan semiconductor stocks have been big beneficiaries. Most analysts are resorting to an upgrade in price target (read:Take a Bite Out of Apple with These ETFs).The Taiwanese economy grew2.88%year over year in Q4, higher than a preliminary 2.58% growth and an upwardly revised 2.12% expansion in Q3. The economy in fact reflected ""the best performancein almost two yearsin the final quarter of 2016.""The economy is export-oriented and mainly focuses on technology-related products. Now with an improving global economy and higher demand for gadgets and smartphones from various brands in emerging markets, tech-component companies are likely to soar higher.ETF ChoicesGiven the recent rally in the Taiwanese market, investors might consider ETF plays from the space. While Taiwan has a substantial share in various emerging market and Asia-Pacific equity ETFs, FTW and EWT can come across as better bets, thanks to their sole focus on Taiwan.EWT in FocusmakeArticleAd();This ETF invests about $2.73 billion of its assets in 91 securities. However, with over one-fifth of the total exposure being on a single company, Taiwan Semiconductor, EWT has significant concentration risk.Hon Hai takes up the second position in the portfolio with about 9% share. However, the rest of the stocks have about a 3% share. Sector-wise, EWT relies heavily on information technology (56%), financials (18.3%) and materials (10.5%). The fund charges an expense ratio of 64 basis points (read:Time to Buy Taiwan ETFs?).First Trust Taiwan AlphaDEX FundFTWThis fund targets the Taiwan stock market and tracks the Nasdaq AlphaDEX Taiwan Index. The fund has a basket of 41 stocks with each security holding less than 4.57% of the assets.Information technology takes the top spot at 48.16% in terms of sectors, followed by financials (27.5%) and materials (12.5%). The fund has amassed just $3.4 million in its asset base and trades in a paltry volume of roughly 1,200 shares. Expense ratio comes in at 0.80%. The fund is up about 11% in the year-to-date period (as of February 22, 2017).Bottom LineWhile both funds have surged almost the same from a year-to-date perspective, we suggest investors should go for EWT given its huge exposure in Taiwan Semiconductor and Hon Hai. These companies are believed to score higher on Apple's new launch.Though the economy runs risks of Trump's anti-outsourcing policy, it is still too early to feel the pinch. As of now, the funds may see some gains (read:Foreign ETFs to Win or Lose on Trump Victory).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Facebook Inc Stock (FB) Pulls Back After Another High: Now What?;2/24/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFacebook Inc(FB) stock apparently hit a ceiling when it touched yetanother record high- the second record high in less than a month.makeArticleAd();FB shares soared to $136.79 on Wednesday before retreating on Thursday. The previous all-time high for Facebook stock was $135.49, which was set on February 2.Facebook's Stock Move is Just Part of a Wider Tech TrendFB shares also managed a new record closing price on Wednesday at $136.12, ahead of the previous record set on February 8, which was $134.20.As Facebook stock retreated on Thursday, so did most of the other big tech names that have also set record highs this year.Microsoft Corporation(MSFT),Amazon.com, Inc.(AMZN),Netflix, Inc.(NFLX),Alphabet Inc(GOOG) andApple Inc.(AAPL) were all in the red at the time of this writing.And all these big tech names are rising and falling pretty much in tandem with major indices, including theS&P 500,NASDAQ CompositeandDow Jones Industrial Average.Facebook Stock Could Drop Off SoonSo will Facebook stock be able to keep up themomentumfor the near future?Apple Inc. vs. Alphabet Inc: Value or Growth?Seeking Alphacontributor Damon Verial warns that it might not, particularly because it almost always loses in March. He describes himself as ""strongly bullish"" on the name but adds that he only feels ""the urge to write about"" it when he thinks it is overvalued.He says he did call a pullback in Facebook stock in the past when it fell $10 to $123 per share over the four days following his call. Then it fell to $115 over the next two weeks.Of course the stock rallied, as he says it ""always"" will, but he notes that anyone who held through that pullback ""missed a significant buyback opportunity that would have more than accommodated a transition from capital gains tax on long-term holdings to income tax on short-term holdings for most sizable positions.""Verial noted that Facebook Inc (FB) stock has been in overbought territory since the end of January, which means it probably won't take much to set off a downward spiral. He pointed to seasonal patterns in data on the stock showing where it almost always goes in each month.According to him, Facebook stock almost always ends January in the green, and its highest Sharpe ratio also is in January. Average gains during the month stand at 10%.But in February, he said the stock's Sharpe ratio has fallen to zero, making the month neutral. Then in March, the Sharpe ratio turns negative, ""hinting at a significant opportunity cost."" He adds that even long-term holders may find it beneficial to avoid the stock during the worst months, which includes March, May and August. These months aren't usuallyearningsmonths anyway, and they're well after the holiday season at a time when spending on digital advertising starts to fall.He does feel that long is the only ""logical"" position to take on Facebook when looking at it from a long-term fundamental perspective.The postFacebook Stock Pulls Back After Touching Another Record Highappeared first onValueWalk.Many academics claim investing is a ""random walk.""

Friday’s Vital Data: Nvidia Corporation (NVDA), Facebook Inc (FB) and United States Steel Corporation (X);2/24/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsU.S. stock futures are trading broadly lower this morning as Wall Street grows uneasy about the recent string of all-time highs from the major market indices. Yesterday, theDow Jones Industrial Averagehit its 10th straight record closing high, and traders this morning appear to be taking profits following the impressive run. On the economic front, new-home sales for January and consumer sentiment for February will both hit the Street this morning.makeArticleAd();Against this nervous backdrop, futures on the Dow have dropped 0.45%, withS&P 500futures down 0.5% andNasdaq-100futures falling 0.6%.On the options front, volume rebounded somewhat on Thursday, though the roughly 15.4 million calls and 14.4 million puts traded were still below average. Turning to the CBOE, the single-session equity put/call volume ratio rose slightly to 0.62, while the 10-day moving average halted its recent decline at 0.60.Turning to Thursday's volume leaders,Nvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA) saw mixed options activity after NVDA stock was smacked with a trio of downgrades. Meanwhile,Facebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) call options were hot yesterday following reports that the company was pursuing an MLB streaming deal. Finally,United States Steel Corporation(NYSE:X) nosedived on news that President Donald Trump could delay his infrastructure spending plans until 2018.Nvidia Corporation (NVDA)With analysts getting nervous about record highs across the board on Wall Street, downgrades were bound to arrive sooner or later. NVDA stock, one of the best performing tech stocks of 2016, emerged as the whipping boy, withInstinet,BMO Capital and Nomuraall downgrading the shares due to valuation concerns.7 Blue-Chip Stocks That Are Flush With CashNomura and Instinet both set a price target of $90, while BMO went further and set a target of $85. All three noted that while growth potential in the automotive and data center markets remained strong, it didn't justify Nvidia's current valuation.NVDA stock fell nearly 9.3% as a result, and the shares are off another 4% in premarket trading this morning.Options traders appeared shaken by the news, with calls dropping to only 55% of the more than 729,000 contracts traded on NVDA stock yesterday - a near-term low for daily call activity for the shares. NVDA is now trading well below all major March call open interest accumulations, and has even breached peak March put OI of 10,000-plus contracts at $100. The $95 strike is the next potential area of options-related support, with 7,700 puts in residence at this strike.Facebook Inc (FB)WhatTwitter Inc(NYSE:TWTR) did with the NFL, Facebook is looking to do with Major League Baseball. The social media giant is exploring adeal to stream one MLB game a weekon its website as part of a push to expand its video offerings. Facebook has experience streaming live events after streaming Mexican soccer games in English via a previous deal withUnivision.Options traders were quick to speculate on the deal, sending 397,000 contracts across the tape on Thursday. What's more, calls made up 69% of the day's take. The short-term options outlook for FB stock continues to lean bullish, as the March put/call OI ratio rests at 0.78. Peak call OI for the series numbers more than 56,000 contracts at the $135 strike, which will trade out-of-the-money this morning if pre-market losses carry over into the open.United States Steel Corporation (X)U.S. Steel stock has surged more than 80% since the election on promises of $1 trillion in infrastructure spending from President Donald Trump. However, a report released yesterday indicated thatTrump may delay his infrastructure planuntil 2018, giving many investors in infrastructure reason to worry. As a result, X stock plunged more than 7.8% on Thursday and the shares are off another 2% in premarket action this morning.Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Just Entered Dangerous TerritoryOptions activity was nearly divided on the shares, with calls eking out 54% of the 316,000 contracts traded yesterday. It will take more than one day of mixed activity to shake X options traders, however, as the short-term outlook remains heavily bullish. Specifically, the March put/call OI ratio rests at 0.62, with calls on the verge of doubling puts among options set to expire within the next month.Peak call OI of 9,700 at the March $40 strike appears a bit out of reach at the moment, but the extended decline has made the March $35 and $36 strikes attractive to those looking for a rebound.As of this writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceThe 7 Best ETFs for Retirement InvestorsThe 10 Best Stock Charts on Wall Street Right NowThe postFriday's Vital Data: Nvidia Corporation (NVDA), Facebook Inc (FB) and United States Steel Corporation (X)appeared first onInvestorPlace."

Apple Inc. Fesses Up to iPhone 6 Battery Issue, Releases Fix;2/24/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIf it seems as thoughApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) has been fighting with battery issues with the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s for months, that's because it has.makeArticleAd();Source: AppleThere was a limited recall of iPhone 6s batteries blamed on a manufacturing issue, problems in China and recently reports of widespread iPhone 6 sudden shutdown issues that seemed battery related. The company always denied any widespread issue.Until now.AAPL has finally acknowledged a problem related to the iPhone 6 battery … and says it has released a fix.The iPhone 6 Battery Has Been … ProblematicIf there's one thing 2016 will be remembered for when it comes to consumer electronics, it's the challenges of working with lithium-ion batteries.5 Income Tax Deductions You Can't Afford to MissThe poster child for just how wrong this technology can go isSamsung Electronic Co Ltd(OTCMKTS:SSNLF). Samsung had a terrible 2016 after its flagship Galaxy Note 7's lithium-ion batteries were implicated in multiple fires, This led to a complete recall of the device, an estimated $10 billion hit, a seriously damaged reputation and anextensive investigation to pinpoint the cause.In comparison, AAPL's iPhone 6 battery woes have been less spectacular, but the cloud over Apple's previous two generations of phones has lasted just as long - if not longer. And they proved much more frustrating in terms of nailing down a cause, or a fix. That's because there appear to be multiple issues at play. And just as Apple admits there's a problem and announces a solution, another iPhone 6 battery issue seems to pop up.In 2016, Apple had to deal with aninvestigation in Chinaover reports that iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s batteries were not only failing, but leaving the devices with expensive damage. Apple's findings pointed to cheap knock-off chargers as the culprit. Then there were reports of iPhone 6s phones unexpectedly shutting down. Apple eventually pinpointed the cause as being a manufacturing defect in a batch of batteries. Abattery exchange programwas launched, but that got off to a rocky start when Apple Stores were flooded by iPhone owners hoping for a replacement battery, and a backlog of repairs.Just as that mess was being sorted out, complaints began to rise of iPhone 6 sudden shutdown issues. This was a new iPhone 6 battery issue and seemed to affect a growing number of users. It also affected the iPhone 6s, but not the iPhone 7.The problem got so bad that at one point in January, rumors started thatApple was planning to launch a full-scale iPhone 6 battery exchange program. However, AAPL continued to deny there was a widespread problem with iPhone and 6s batteries.Now, Apple has come clean.Apple Releases Fix for iPhone 6 Shutdown IssueThe company finally admitted that iPhone 6 and 6s phones have been suddenly and randomly shutting down, forcing owners to plug them into a charger before they can be restarted. But, AAPL says it released a fix and it's effective.In a statement released toTechCrunch, Apple says iOS 10.2.1 finally addresses the issue:""We're seeing a more than 80% reduction in iPhone 6s and over 70% reduction on iPhone 6 of devices unexpectedly shutting down.""So what happened?AAPL says the iPhone 6 battery (and in some cases the iPhone 6s as well) suffers from a limitation of all-lithium-ion batteries. As these batteries get older, they sometime deliver power unevenly. This could trigger the iPhone's power management system to force an emergency shutdown to protect the device.Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Just Entered Dangerous TerritoryApple made changes to that system in iOS 10.2.1, essentially making it less sensitive to minor fluctuations. It also added new functionality so that should an iPhone 6 sudden shutdown occur, the user can restart their device without having to be connected to a charger. The company says it also will add a battery diagnostic screen to iOS that warns iPhone owners when their battery requires service.The fact this issue was directly related to aging lithium-ion batteries explains why it was the iPhone 6 battery being implicated more frequently than the 6s, why the numbers seemed to keep growing and why the iPhone 7 hasn't yet been affected.Will this mark the end of AAPL's drawn out iPhone 6 battery saga? The company has been playing whack-a-mole trying to identify issues with its lithium-ion batteries. But this fix seems to be enough of an umbrella solution that it may finally be able to put this chapter behind it.And let Apple go back to the good old days when complaints were limited to wishing the iPhone lasted longer on a battery charge …As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceWWDC 2017: Here's What Apple Inc.

Qualcomm, Inc. (QCOM) Stock Has Big Prospects Despite Its Problems;2/24/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIt's a bittersweet victory, to be sure. Just whenQualcomm, Inc.(NASDAQ:QCOM) starts to unveil a game-changing technology, a legal hurricane starts to make landfall. If any current or would-be owners of QCOM stock are torn as to what the future likely holds, there's good reason.makeArticleAd();Source:Karlis Dambrans via FlickrAnd yet, as much jeopardy as the company's bottom line may be in at this time, the fact that Qualcomm stock is still down more than 25% over the past three years suggests the market saw a litigation headwind coming sooner or later. The worst-case scenario may already be priced into QCOM stock, which means the recent weakness makes for a compelling entry point.The BadThe legal wrangling is mostly withApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL), superficially. But, should Apple be successful with its effort, it opens the door to other litigation, not to mention emboldens a similar case being brought against Qualcomm by the Federal Trade Commission.The short version of the story: Apple (and the FTC and the Korea Fair Trade Commission, for that matter) are all arguing the same thing - Qualcomm's business model of licensing its technologies to phonemakers isnot only exorbitant, but unlawfully stifles competition. That's a legal no-no in most any country. The Korea Fair Trade Commission isseeking $873 million for essentially the same.The 10 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold ForeverFor the record, QCOM has lost this argument before. In 2015, thecompany forked over $975 million to Chinafor breaking that country's antitrust laws. Indeed, Qualcomm wasallegedly charging all-encompassing licensing feesto phonemakers that may or may not have needed access to all of the technology in that IP package… another dubious practice.Years of sharp dealing have finally caught up with Qualcomm.The GoodThe irony is, while the company was over-milking its aging patent portfolio, QCOM was also developing some new - and highly marketable - intellectual property.The idea of the Internet of Things (IoT) is an exciting one, but the reality is, the technology and bandwidth needed to meet the need just isn't ready, yet. Or, it wasn't anyway. This week, Qualcommunveiled its 802.11ax technology, which can carry four times the amount of data current Wi-Fi technology carries, but without using any more bandwidth.Qualcomm Technologies VP Rahul Patel explained:It is taking Wi-Fi to a new level from a user-experience point of view. What it is trying to do is prepare the Wi-Fi network, which in many cases is experiencing a lot of congestion, largely because the network is becoming dense and is not able to deal with the amount of traffic.At the same time, the company has created a whole new kind of RF ""front end,"" or the radio connection between a mobile phone's modem and the transceiver. Not only is it a superior solution to current alternatives, it's a simpler solution that works with a variety of connection protocols, such as LTE and MIMO, by the utilization of modem intelligence.They're not the kind of advances the average consumer cares about, or even understands. With 5G connectivity about to become the norm, however, these little advances are actually big advances that phonemakers will desperately need.Bottom Line for QCOM StockIn simplest terms, the future of QCOM stock lies somewhere between the two ends of this good/bad continuum. One way or another, sooner or later, Qualcomm's business model of leveraging an aging patent portfolio - and doing so in a questionable manner - is going to falter. If the company wants to continue being an IP player, it's going to need some new IP.The question is, will 802.11ax and new RF front-end platforms be enough? It matters, simply becausethe company's licensing and royalty revenue is roughly twice its revenue from outright chip sales.3 Stocks That Could Soar on a Short SqueezeThe answer to this question is a qualified yes; the qualification is the speed with which lawsuits will result in a decision, and the time that will be needed for IoT and 5G to reach critical mass. Odds are good the former will hurt before the latter helps, meaning Qualcomm could be headed for a dry spell, earnings-wise.Still, for the true long-termer who can stomach the ""in the meantime"" volatility, the market may start to appreciate the potential of the distant future now…after a few years of strong bearish pressure.QCOM stock may not be appropriate for grandma's retirement portfolio, but there's little doubt the company's new technologies will be crucial to the next generation of connectivity.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceApple Inc.

We explore this idea in the latest edition ofthe Dutram Reportwhere Eric Dutram talks with Kevin Quigg, Chief Strategist of ACSI Funds. Kevin's company is at the forefront of customer satisfaction research, and they have some great insights into the link between having satisfied customers, and satisfied investors too. To listen to the podcast, click here: (https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/246643/is-customer-satisfaction-the-hidden-key-to-stock-outperformance)As consumers, we have all been frustrated by companies which did not meet our expectations. Either poor service or a low-quality product, the end result was always the desire to do less business with the given company.However, on the other side of the coin, there are those companies out there that go above and beyond, time and time again. Those are the companies I like to frequent, and I have always wondered if these types of firms-which have a long history of satisfying their customers-end up making better investments too.Well, in this edition ofthe Dutram Report, I talk to Kevin Quigg, chief strategist at ACSI Funds, for some insights into this topic and if this idea works as an investment.Inside ACSIKevin is an expert in the American Customer Satisfaction Index, a benchmark that exists to find companies that customers either like, or would rather avoid. This is done by looking at a few key areas of the customer satisfaction process, including customer expectations, perceived value, and perceived quality.This data has proven to be extremely popular with companies, as it helps them to keep tabs on the competition and to see their relative standing among their peers too. But the data can also be used to shape the outlook for companies and to see how they are trending in terms of customer satisfaction, which can help to show which companies are moving in the right direction.ACSI's idea is that customer satisfaction leads to customer loyalty, which leads to additional consumer spending which ultimately leads to long-term stock appreciation. This intuitively makes sense, and now there is a way to use this strategy in ETF form.The ETFThis is via ACSI Funds' American Customer Satisfaction Core Alpha ETF (ACSI). This product holds securities that have high ACSI customer satisfaction scores, with the theory being that these will outperform their low-satisfaction peers.Current holdings include well-respected names like Apple (AAPL), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Alphabet (GOOG) just to name a few, though there are dozens of names in the portfolio. And if you are wondering what is done for sectors where customer satisfaction levels aren't as readily available, such as energy or materials, big ETFs-such asXLEorXLB-are utilized in order to give more broad market-like exposure.Bottom LineFor a more in-depth look at this index as well as its investable counterpart, make sure to listen to the podcast for additional information. We highlight some of the strengths and potential pitfalls when it comes to this strategy, and how it might fit into a portfolio too.So, make sure to listen to this edition ofthe Dutram Reportfor a closer look at this interesting strategy for tackling the equity world, and the potential for investors to exploit this simple idea for their portfolios.

Trump's Tax Policy May Make for Some Very Easy Investing;2/23/2017;"President Donald Trump hasn't officially released his proposed changes to tax policy yet, but we pretty much know what to expect.It is going to make life very easy for us as investors. We can just buy the most profitable U.S. companies with the biggest hoards of balance sheet cash and then relax.makeArticleAd();We know that we can count on a reduction in the tax rate corporations pay. As recently as December Trump indicated that he planned to have the rate of corporate tax reduced from 35% to 15%.Part two of the reduction in corporate taxes is the ""repatriation holiday"" that Trump wants that would allow companies to bring overseas cash back home without having to pay a significant amount of tax on it.Both of these changes are going to benefit the biggest, strongest companies in the country.In his fourth-quarter letter, hedge fund manager David Einhorn observed that the way to invest for Trump policies is to focus on companies that are currently paying a lot of income taxes. It makes perfect sense.The most profitable companies are going to get a huge bump up in cash flow when that corporate tax rate drops to 15%. What would be ideal then is to find companies that are both very profitable (paying a lot of income tax) and have a lot of overseas cash that the repatriation holiday can free up.A company that fits that mold very well would beApple(AAPL). Apple is a longtime position in Einhorn's fund and a very profitable company with a lot of overseas cash.Here is what Einhorn said specifically about Apple in his recent investor letter:Apple stands to benefit from repatriation of foreign cash and tax reform. The company has over $200 billion in offshore cash it could bring back to the U.S. Apple also derives a majority of its earnings from foreign sources but still accrues GAAP taxes at a 25% rate, which is higher than many other large tech companies. The lower corporate tax rates proposed as part of repatriation and tax reform could therefore lead Apple toward a structurally lower GAAP tax rate going forward.If Apple's tax paid on repatriating that cash just drops by 25% that means the company should be worth $50 billion more than it was without the repatriation holiday. That is a $10 per share bump without the company having to do anything.If Apple's annual tax rate also drops by 60% under a Trump corporate tax cut that would reduce GAAP income tax expense from $15 billion last year to $4.8 billion. That is a $10 billion bump to earnings which on just a 10 multiple means a $100 billion increase to Apple's market capitalization. That is closer to $20 per share.Add the two of them together and you could see a $30 per share bump inApple's share pricejust from Trump's tax policies. That is on a stock that is arguably attractively priced already.Thank you for the idea, Mr. Einhorn. Thank you for making investing easy, Mr. Trump.Disclosure:I don't own shares of any company mentioned in this articleStart afree seven-day trialof Premium Membership to GuruFocus.Warning!

7 Blue-Chip Stocks That Are Flush With Cash;2/23/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsCash is king. It not only drives growth, but it permits flexibility. And it's the reason why so many blue-chip stocks are flush with it.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockBlue-chip stocks with tons of cash are more likely to survive downturns in business or the economy, and can choose whether to deploy their greenbacks toward growth, R&D, share buybacks or dividends.When thinking about which stocks to buy for my forthcoming stock advisory newsletter,The Liberty Portfolio, blue-chip stocks with tons of cash are going to be important players.3 Covered Calls to Squeeze Dividends Out of Thin AirHere are seven blue-chip stocks to consider for your own portfolio that happens to have tons of cash.Blue-Chip Stocks: Apple (AAPL)Source: ShutterstockCash Balance:$247 billionWhat It Should Do:Increase dividendsApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) has to top the list of blue-chip stocks to buy with lots of cash. AAPL has $247 billion of cash on hand, although most of it is stuck overseas.However, we are in a new era, and it is an era where President Trump and Congress may lower the corporate tax rate to 15%. If that happens, the $230 billion of cash it holds overseas will be repatriated. That will leave Apple with $212 billion of cash.This insane amount of money will be partially used to bump the dividend, probably by as much as $4 per share over time, pushing AAPL stock into income stock territory.Blue-Chip Stocks: General Electric (GE)Source: ShutterstockCash Balance:$92 billionWhat It Should Do:M&A, Share buybacksGeneral Electric Company(NYSE:GE) is not the company it once was, and I recently wrote that I don't think you want to be buying GE stock at $30 per share. However, it has about $92 billion in cash on hand, and most of it is overseas, as well.Repatriating that money would leave it with a sizable $77 billion cash hoard. GE is already loved by income investors, so my guess is that GE would use the cash to continue making acquisitions and foolishly buying back stock.The 10 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold ForeverThat will boost per-share earnings and create inorganic growth that keeps the GE name alive as far as investing is concerned.Blue-Chip Stocks: Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)Source:Dawn Via FlickrCash Balance:$40 billionWhat It Should Do:Increase dividends, R&D, M&AI'm not keen onJohnson & Johnson(NYSE:JNJ) despite the fact that it is one of these blue-chip stocks that has recently hit all-time highs. I'm mystified because it isn't growing net income and is really struggling as a company.Still, with about $40 billion in cash and more than $13 billion in fairly predictable annual cash flow, JNJ should bump up its dividend by another $1 per share, and plow the rest into R&D and acquisitions.3 Struggling Stocks That Could Make Epic RunsIt needs to grow, and right now it's just a sitting duck that's insanely overpriced.Blue-Chip Stocks: Coca-Cola (KO)Source:Chris Nielsen via FlickrCash Balance:$25 billionWhat It Should Do:M&ATheCoca-Cola Co(NYSE:KO) is in a bit of trouble, as the world moves away from sugary and unhealthy drinks. Because it has $25 billion of cash on hand, about $8 billion in annual and predictable free cash flow and needs to find a vision, it should deploy that cash by making a bold acquisition.It needs to buy some massive group of beverage companies that are growing organically and have caught consumers' taste. That's the only way this legend is going to be able to move into the future. Otherwise, it can just settle into flat-growth mode and pay an increasingly uncompetitive 3.5% yield.Blue-Chip Stocks: Microsoft (MSFT)Source:Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified)Cash Balance:$132 billionWhat It Should Do:Increase dividends, M&A, R&DMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) is in the enviable position of having about $132 billion of cash on hand, while also having settled comfortably into Peter Lynch stalwart territory.MSFT only pays out less than half of its reliable $25 billion to $27 billion of free cash flow. It can easily bump its dividend by another $1 per share and push the yield up toward 4%, and even higher if it wished to.7 Ultra-Cheap Value Stocks to Buy NowThen it could drop a huge chunk of money into a mega-acquisition that would push it into growth stock territory again. Or it could just keep trying to expand its footprint with big R&D spends.Blue-Chip Stocks: Alphabet (GOOGL)Source: ShutterstockCash Balance:$92 billionWhat It Should Do:NothingWe obviously must mentionAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) here, considering its $92 billion in cash and $26 billion in free cash flow this past year.GOOGL needs to move beyond being a digital billboard and venture capital incubator, but I don't think it needs to rush to do anything because its core business is still growing nicely and it is undervalued.I say it should just hold onto that cash and wait until growth flags before making a bold move into a growth arena with a big acquisition. Right now, though, investors aren't even demanding a dividend, so I say, hold onto that cash.Blue-Chip Stocks: Pfizer (PFE)Source:Kojach Via FlickrCash Balance:$38 billionWhat It Should Do:R&DPfizer Inc.(NYSE:PFE) sits on almost $40 billion in cash, yet it finds itself with a growth problem, with earnings growth slogging along at 6.5% annually.It's trading at a ridiculous 12 times forward earnings multiple. Like its other pharma and biotech counterparts, it needs a serious jump-start, and the only real way for that to occur is to seriously ramp up R&D. It needs to find blockbuster drugs and it has the money to do so.The 3 Best REITs for Sky-High Total ReturnsIt can't just buy up little things here and there. A Pfizer for the future is a Pfizer that revisits what made it great in its past.Lawrence Meyers is the CEO of PDL Capital, and manager of the forthcomingLiberty Portfolio stock newsletter.

This Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Trade Is a Sure Thing;2/23/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsImmediately after the U.S. elections, the consensus was to buy the small caps and financials. The money had to come from somewhere, so Wall Street sold mega-cap tech to chase the trend then. Stocks likeAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) fell, but eventually recovered. GOOGL stock even set a new all-time high. Then came earnings season.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockThe reaction to GOOGL earnings was brutal - shares fell 6% in four days. Luckily, GOOGL bulls stepped in and defended the stock. As a result, Alphabet Inc has all but erased the entire post-earnings dip.I've always said that the short-term reaction to earnings is purely a gamble. And that the longer-term fundamentals will eventually prevail.My interpretation of Alphabet earnings is that the Google machine is still on rails! It prints money from multiple assets that have more than a billion users; management is a proven winner; and spending on crazy ventures has abated. Alphabet now even have official structures to profit from the self-driving auto arena.3 Covered Calls to Squeeze Dividends Out of Thin AirSo, for the long term, I have no real worry for GOOGL stock other than the general equity market gyrations. If markets sell off, so will GOOGL. Conversely, I don't expect shares to fall too far on their own from the company's own actions.GOOGL Options PlayOptions are liquid enough to allow me to set in motion trades with ample buffers that I expect to be sure winners given the current environment. The trick is to find a level where GOOGL stock will be defended by fundamental investors. Then I sell risk against those levels and sit back and let time work for me.You've read the statistic that most options expire worthless. So I'd want to be a seller of options since the buyers lose most often.The Bet:Sell the GOOGL Jan 2018 $660 put. This is a bullish trade for which I collect $13 per contract to open. The 20% buffer from current price gives this trade a 95% theoretical chance of success. Selling naked puts is dangerous. Not everyone is comfortable exposing themselves to such downside risk. If GOOGL stock falls below my sold put, I am committed to owning the stock at that level. So anything below $647 per share would accrue losses if GOOGL falls 30% or so.Since risk tolerances vary, I will offer an alternate trade with similar metrics but with a finite risk profile. The alternate version would better fit smaller accounts, too.The Alternate:Sell the GOOGL Jan 2018 $670/$660 credit put spread. This, too, is a bullish trade for which I collect $1.25 per contract to open. The price buffer is about the same, so the theoretical chance of success is still more than 90%. If successful, this trade yields 14% on money risked. I still need GOOGL stock to stay above my sold spread to win.Usually, I like to balance my trade by selling opposite risk. In this case, I will offer the option to do that, but I will delay entry a little in this ""animal spirited"" equity market.The Hedge (Optional):Sell the GOOGL Jan 2018 $1060/$1080 credit call spread. This is a bearish trade for which I collect $1.50 per contract to open. I need GOOGL to stay below my sold strike to win. There is no $10 wide spread available yet, so I can't make it a perfect iron condor. This trade, if successful, can yield 8% on money risked.How to Trade Facebook Inc for 470% ReturnsUsually, in perfect iron condors, my potential yield would almost double because I can only lose on one side or the other. In this case, the two sides will balance, but not perfectly. I am not required to hold these options trades through expiration. I can close any of them for partial gains or losses.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director ofSellSpreads.com. As of this writing, he did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Today, we'll look at that and otherApple Rumorsfor Thursday.makeArticleAd();ColorWare AirPods:Customers that are wanting their AirPods to look a little more unique can now pay for a custom paint job, reportsMacRumors. ColorWare handles custom painting of Apple products, as well as other devices. It now sells custom color options for AirPods. This lets customers order AirPods that are different from the plain white ones sold by AAPL. However, the price is expensive. A pair of custom AirPods, as well as a custom color for the AirPods case, is almost double the normal price of the wireless earbuds.Wireless Charging:Apple is reportedly working with several different groups on wireless charging,9to5Macnotes. These reports claim that the tech company has five different groups that are developing wireless charging. APPL has also joined the Wireless Power Consortium. Current rumors claim that the company wants to bring wireless charging to its upcoming iPhone 8. However, these rumors are conflicting on how exactly the feature will work.Acoustic Imaging:Apple has filed a patent for acoustic imaging technology that may replace Touch ID, reportsAppleInsider. The acoustic imaging technology technology works in two stages. The first sends out acoustic waves that would be able to move through the display of the device. The second stage has it sensing the feedback from those waves. This allows it to create a 2D image of objects. It would also allow the company to remove the psychical Home button used for Touch ID from its mobile devices.Check out more recentApple RumorsorSubscribe to Apple Rumors:RSSThe postThursday Apple Rumors: ColorWare Offers Custom AirPod Paintingappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Apple Inc. vs. Alphabet Inc: Value or Growth?;2/23/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsChoosing between buyingApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) andAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL) is the classic choice between value and growth. And if you were confused, AAPL stock is the value play, while GOOGL stock provides the growth.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockWhile Apple shares have been on fire in 2017 - up 17% - you can still get in for a price-to-earnings ratio around 16, lower than what investors are paying for the averageS&P 500stock. You also get a dividend of 57 cents per share, more than covered by earnings.GOOGL is the growth play. Revenues increased to $90 billion last year from $55 billion in 2013. This justifies a P/E of nearly 30. The shares are also up 17% over the last 12 months.Right now, investors prefer value over growth and Apple stock is doing better than Alphabet. But this isn't the proverbial choice between a rock and a hard place, instead, it's more like picking between cookies and ice cream. I own both stocks, I have owned them for several years, and I have profited handsomely holding both.The Case for AAPL StockNo technology company is as adept at squeezing profit from hardware as Apple.While other smartphone companies struggle to make money, Apple regularly brings $1 of every $4 in iPhone sales to its bottom line. Its closed ecosystem is perceived as safe and their products last for years.7 Ultra-Cheap Value Stocks to Buy NowThe current case for Apple stock, however, has little to do with hardware. Instead,services now drivethe stock forward. Services like its app store - from which it takes a 30% cut of sales - Apple Music, iPay and iCloud have become huge, with $7.17 billion of revenue in the fourth quarter alone. The success of its services enabled Apple to become a power in the cloud by putting more than$12 billioninto capital spending last year. It's no secret that the cloud is a capital-intensive business, but Apple has been able to out-spend cloud rivals without disturbing its profit machine.AAPL hadover $246 billion in cashon its books at the end of last year, most of it kept overseas. The Trump administration has proposed a one-time tax cut to encourage Apple to bring this cash back to the U.S. That's enough money to buy companies such asComcast Corporation(NASDAQ:CMCSA) orWalt Disney Co(NYSE:DIS) outright.When analysts subtract the Apple cash from its market cap, they find the company itself valued at ""just"" $460 billion, with a PE of 9 and just over two times sales. If you're looking for a cheap value stock, poised for an era of unprecedented growth, with plenty of safety and margin for error, they say, buy AAPL today.The Case for GOOGL StockThe artists formerly known as Google have a different case to make.Alphabet has become acash flow monster, delivering nearly $40 billion in operating cash flow last year. Its revenue grew nearly 20%, and GOOGL's operating margin is over 25%.Clouds scale like no invention ever seen before, and Alphabet delivers a global search service for literally nothing. Its Android operating system is on87% of all smartphones, against just 12% for Apple, and Alphabet doesn't have to build or sell them. It just watches as customers who own them come to its services.But with no fanfare, GOOGL has also become a power in hardware. Its Chromebooks now outsell Apple's Macintosh line with about 5% of the PC market. Alphabet now participates in all the hardware markets pioneered by rivals - from virtual reality headsets to streaming devices - with watches and personal assistants that let you conduct searches of your home or the world with just your voice.Under CFO Ruth Porat, who joined the company fromMorgan Stanley(NYSE:MS) in 2015, Alphabet is finally telling investors how much they're spending on ""other bets"" like robots and self-driving cars, and it's working to make money on those ventures.The Bottom LineIt's hard to see a loser here.Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Is Feelings. Nothing More Than Feelings.The perceived threat to Alphabet is the growing balkanization of the Internet, with national governments seeking to control what people see and say within their borders, and who can profit from it. That has yet to impact GOOGL, but even the perception can hurt a stock.AAPL is currently benefiting from a global flight to safety. Its enormous cash position, its strength as a luxury brand, and its growth in services, which could easily be expanded into competition in the cloud with companies such as Alphabet, are all seen in the best light right now.If pushed to the wall and forced to buy just one right now, I would probably go with GOOG, the non-voting version of Alphabet stock, which shares equally in earnings but sells at a $20 per share discount to the GOOGL shares.But both companies are likeGeneral Motors Company(NYSE:GM) was in the 1950s,International Business Machines Corp.(NYSE:IBM) was in the 1960s, andHalliburton Company(NYSE:HAL) was in the last decade.

Apple's (AAPL) Eco-friendly Headquarters to Open in April;2/23/2017;"After massive delays and cost escalations,Apple Inc.AAPLhas finally announced that its new headquarters named Apple Park will be ready by April this year.Per the press release, Apple Park will be powered entirely by renewable energy and will need no artificial heating/air conditioning for a major part of the year. The solar panels installed in the Park are expected to generate 17 megawatts of power. The building will have natural ventilation.In 2011, Apple co-founder Steve Jobs had envisioned Apple's futuristic design headquarters. CEO Tim Cook said ""Steve's vision for Apple stretched far beyond his time with us. He intended Apple Park to be the home of innovation for generations to come. The workspaces and parklands are designed to inspire our team as well as benefit the environment. We've achieved one of the most energy-efficient buildings in the world and the campus will run entirely on renewable energy.""Apple Park is spread across 175 acres of land in Santa Clara valley. The Park's main building is ring shaped (likened to a spaceship widely) and about 2.8 million square feet in area. Apple claims that that building is ""clad entirely in the world's largest panels of curved glass."" Apple Park also has a 1000-seat auditorium, which will be named after Jobs who died in 2011 after a long battle with pancreatic cancer.Apple said that it will start moving its employees from April and will take about half a year to completely move 12K of the company's employees to the new headquarters. Like many other campuses, Apple Park will feature cafes and a fitness center.Apple Inc. PriceApple Inc. Price|Apple Inc. QuoteReportedly, Apple Park was designed by Apple's design chief Sir Jony Ive in partnership with architecture firm Foster + Partners and built for an estimated cost of $5 billion.Apple's Go Green InitiativesApple is one of the many big companies that took up climate change issues head on. Cook had earlier commented ""Climate change is one of the great challenges of our time, and the time for action is now. The transition to a new green economy requires innovation, ambition and purpose. We believe passionately in leaving the world better than we found it and hope that many other suppliers, partners and other companies join us in this important effort.""In fact, Apple meets 93% of its energy requirements via renewable energy facilities across the globe as per its 2016 Environmental Responsibility Report.It has been aggressively investing to source renewable energy for its operations. The company has set an ambitious target to fuel 100% of its global energy needs, including supply chain, solely through renewable resources like solar, geothermal & wind power, biogas and hydro power. As per sources, Apple's supply chain needs over an estimated 60 times more energy than its own facilities.Apple states that it has gone 100% green in 23 countries including China, Germany and Singapore. Plus, all of Apple's data centers are running on clean energy. It uses entirely recycled/sustainable paper for 99% of its packaging.Undoubtedly, going green will help big companies to save on costs while helping to protect the environment at the same time.Zacks Rank and Share Price MovementAt present, Apple has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Is Still a Top Tech Stock;2/23/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsI'm a firm believer inAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL). In the markets, there is an elite group of companies that define their respective industries. For example,Amazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) owns e-commerce, whileFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) has forever changed social media. And for now,Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) is the king of smart devices. But in my humble opinion, GOOGL stock tops them all.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockDon't get me wrong as this is not a slight against any of the above companies. Just let me forward a very basic observation - all these other names essentially require the internet to function. If not directly, then certainly, access to the internet represents their core marketing message.But what happens when you own the internet? That's a theoretical question to everyone except GOOGL.As I mentioned in a prior contribution, thedominanceof the GOOGL search engine is unparalleled. The margin between Alphabet Inc and the next biggest competitor, Bing, is a whopping 300%. It just gets worse as you go down the rankings. By the time you hit fifth place, it's just not even worth considering. In any other industry, such a statement would be the death knell for the competition.Essentially, GOOGL stock is an investment in life itself. Many people thought that thename changeto Alphabet - a play on the financial term ""alpha"" and the gambling term ""bet"" - was cheeky and a bit ridiculous. But it also signified that Alphabet Inc could do whatever it wants because no one can stop it. GOOGL stock was essentially either an asset or a threat, depending on your perspective.Volatility Is a Risk to GOOGL StockUnfortunately, where it matters most for investors, GOOGL stock hasn't always shown its best stuff. True, it's early into 2017, and so far, it's up over 4% year-to-date. Keep that up every month and you're guaranteed a stellar annual return. But Alphabet Inc has also beeninconsistent, as InvestorPlace contributor Chris Tyler points out. For example, GOOGL was looking at closing January at over 6%. Instead, it only secured 1.4%.7 Ultra-Cheap Value Stocks to Buy NowOn a strictly nominal basis, that's not much of a swing. But on percentage basis, it's a much different story. It has been well over a decade since Alphabet stock introduced itself to the markets. The crazy dynamics involved in a fresh tech company should be over by now. Today, GOOGL and its subsidiaries are comparable toGeneral Electric Company(NYSE:GE) if GE was a little more hip.But with great size comes great envy. Alphabet Inc now faces a fundamental problem.Oracle Corporation(NYSE:ORCL) wants to reengage acourt rulingthat went in favor of GOOGL. At issue is the company's generous use of Oracle's Java software in order to design the Android operating system. GOOGL contends that using Java - which is open-source - is fair game. Oracle contends that it violates the ""fair use "" component of copyright law.For those that acquired GOOGL stock, it's an ugly situation that might be a legitimate risk. Here's the thing - whether it's legitimate or not doesn't matter. If the markets think it's a problem, it's a problem. That makes the sighting of what appears to be a bearish head-and-shoulders pattern (between early December until now) a curious development.Don't Panic on Alphabet IncGenerally, it's not the best idea to buy an investment with baggage. Certainly, it's not a good idea when the baggage is from a giant company like Oracle. Ditto that for its 6'3″ CEO that doesn't come off as someone you want to mess with. In other words, GOOGL stock has some challenges.3 Struggling Stocks That Could Make Epic RunsI also don't think it's a coincidence that the head-and-shoulders pattern is emerging right now. If I'm looking at Alphabet Inc purely as a swing trade, I wouldn't go full bore at this juncture. I expect shares to at least test its 50-day moving average, which stands just under $800. It would not shock me, however, to see GOOGL stock slide towards its 200-day moving average, which is around $763.Again, that's looking at Alphabet Inc from a short-term perspective. For those that have a wider time horizon, the king of the internet is as strong technically as it is fundamentally. Aside from some bumps in the road, GOOGL stock is enjoying clear blue skies. Most importantly, those bumps have never affected Alphabet Inc in a permanent way.The bottom line here is that I would be content holding GOOGL stock. Further, any dips are justifiable buying opportunities, not mere contrarianism for its own sake. Alphabet Inc isgoing to $1,000- just try to ignore the turbulence as best you can.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace7 Consumer Stocks That Will Knock Your Socks Off7 Stocks to Sell or Short Before the Bears StrikeThe postAlphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Is Still a Top Tech Stockappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Has Fitbit Inc (FIT) Stock Finally Hit the Bottom?;2/23/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIf there was ever a company that needs good news, and good newsnow, it would beFitbit Inc(NYSE:FIT). Immediately after its introduction to the retail market, FIT made a pronounced impact on the health and wellness sector. More importantly, it became a cultural phenomenon thanks to the company's quirky advertisements. But in the financial markets, Fitbit stock has lacked.makeArticleAd();Source:Via FitbitSure, Wall Street piled into Fitbit stock during its initial public offering honeymoon phase. Between June 18 until Aug. 5 of 2015, FIT stock gained an extremely impressive 74%. Unfortunately, that only covers 34 trading days. Since then, Fitbit stock has become the antithesis of its consumer base: lethargic, unmotivated and … well, something that rhymes with ""FIT.""But with the once on-fire consumer tech firm releasing its fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 results, will fortune shine on Fitbit stock?Just by looking at the hard numbers, I wouldn't hold my breath.Tough Earnings for Fitbit to SwallowFitbit reported aQ4 lossof $146.3 million. Although the fact that FIT went into the red wasn't a surprise, the magnitude certainly was. On a per share basis, Fitbit stock was expected by Wall Street analysts to mitigate negativity to 48 cents. Instead, losses adjusted for one-time gains and costs resulted in 56 cents of red ink.7 Ultra-Cheap Value Stocks to Buy NowThe top line didn't impress, either. For Q4, forecasted revenue averaged $575.8 million. In actuality, FIT stock managed $573.8 million, or a negative surprise of a little more than 0.3%. The margin of the miss isn't so bad in and of itself. However, with so many critics taking aim at Fitbit stock, the company needed something spectacular on this front. Whatever this is, it just isn't going to do the trick.Although it's not fair, the Fitbit earnings miss is exaggerated due to the fact that it's the first one. According toCNBC's archives, prior to yesterday's earnings report, the device maker leveraged an averageearnings surpriseof 103%.One of the most prominent criticisms came from Jim Cramer. Appearing on CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street"" segment late last month, Cramer suggested that FIT was acommoditized company. Once people buy the product, there is no compelling reason to buy again. And when you consider the sharp erosion in sales growth, it's hard not to see this point.To illustrate, quarter-over-quarterrevenue growthin 2015 was 170%. In 2016, it has dropped to an alarming 25%!Since they're not killing it on profitability margins, FIT has drastic actions to take. At least to that end, management is making the right moves.Easing the Minds of Fitbit Stock BuyersLast month, FIT announced aseries of layoffs, which will affect about 10% of the total workforce. The tech firm is hoping to save $200 million, which is a huge deal for its size.We also have to reconsider this criticism of Fitbit stock as a ""commoditized"" investment. It's both a valid and an invalid argument. You can literally say the same thing aboutApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL),Samsung Electronic(OTCMKTS:SSNLF), andSony Corp (ADR)(NYSE:SNE). That hasn't stopped them from making smart phones, tablets and cameras. The latter is a particularly good example of a widely distributed product continuing to find solid demand.Tesla Inc (TSLA) Is Making a Giant Push in Its Supercharger NetworkIt shouldn't come as no surprise that we live in a disposable world. Many of us couldn't fathom driving the same car for more than three or four years. As long as FIT stock remains an innovation investment first, I don't care about ancillary titles like commoditized.And the company has a strong user base. Build those numbers, and Fitbit Inc can turn that frown upside down.Finally, there is something to be said about hitting rock bottom. Fitbit is sitting at breakeven despite what otherwise was apretty lousy reportthat also included negative guidance.The bearishness seems completely priced in. I'm not guaranteeing a floor, but there are enough positives for Fitbit stock to begin recovering from here.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto was long SNE.More From InvestorPlaceApple Inc.

Apple Reaches Analyst Target Price;2/23/2017;"In recent trading, shares of Apple Inc (Symbol: AAPL) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $137.10, changing hands for $137.11/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.makeArticleAd();There are 29 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Apple Inc, but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $85.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $185.00. The standard deviation is $18.383.But the whole reason to look at theaverageAAPL price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with AAPL crossing above that average target price of $137.10/share, investors in AAPL have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $137.10 just one stop on the way to an evenhighertarget, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?

While this may not be in direct competition with Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX-Free Report) it does look like competition for Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOGL-Free Report) YouTube, Spotify and Pandora (NYSE:P-Free Report). It's also definitely competition for eyeballs in what is limited free time for all-Facebook TV AppFacebook has launched a new TV app for Amazon Fire TV, Apple TV and Samsung Smart TV, with possible plans to further expand to other platforms like Microsoft Xbox, Sony PlayStation and other streaming devices. While this will likely enable/support longer video formats, Facebook has said its intention is not to compete with Netflix but rather to enable Facebook users to watch their preferred video on just about any screen of their choice (and that includes TV screens).Of course that's not the only video announcement Facebook made. The company says that henceforth, videos will play automatically with the sound turned on by default (if the device sound is turned on) and the window will retreat to the bottom corner of the screen so you can keep watching the video while scrolling through your newsfeed. Facebook says that testing is showing a positive reaction from users, although it's obvious that not everyone will be overjoyed.Facebook is also reportedly in talks with music labels to bring their content to the app, which seems like an open challenge to YouTube, Google's competing site. For labels, the new distribution channel will increase their leverage against YouTube for more favorable terms. On the flip side, the chances of piracy will increase given the nature of Facebook's free platform.The increased scope for advertising is also an indication that the company is gearing up to grab its share of TV ad dollars.Apple Getting Ready to Debut Reality ShowEddie Cue, Apple's SVP of Internet software and services used the Recode Media Conference to express a lot of enthusiasm for Apple's soon-to-be released ""Planet of the Apps"" reality show on its music subscription service. Contestants will get 60 seconds to explain their idea on an escalator and could win up to millions in venture capital funding if judges will.i.am, Jessica Alba, Gary Vaynerchuk and Gwyneth Paltrow approve. This is the first attempt by Apple to create original content and will likely be joined by Carpool Karaoke in April (Apple bought out the unscripted version of this show in the summer of last year).Google Fiber RestructuringAlphabet has been trimming staff at its Access unit, which is responsible for its high-speed Internet service called Fiber. But last week, the trimming was more in the nature of hacking as it transferred hundreds of employees to other units, retaining just enough to work in the field. The unit also has a new CEO in Greg McCray, who was formerly CEO of Aero Communications and currently also serves on the board of telecom company CenturyLink.The changes while significant are not really surprising, because Google has had a lot of trouble with Fiber not only because of the expense but also because of tussles with telecom companies over their control on telecom poles. In fact, ever since its acquisition of WebPass last year, speculation has been rife that the company will replace or reduce fiber deployment with a cheaper wireless service. That plan seems to have crystallized now as Google cuts staff but remains committed to expanding its Fiber service.Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations.Get #1 Stock of the Day pick for free.About Zacks Equity ResearchZacks Equity Research provides the best of quantitative and qualitative analysis to help investors know what stocks to buy and which to sell for the long-term.Continuous coverage is provided for a universe of 1,150 publicly traded stocks.

Netflix contributed about $58 million in gross revenue to the category in the fourth quarter, an increase from the mere $7.9 million a year earlier, according to the Sensor Tower report.Investors are keen to learn if Apple is interested or planning anytime soon to acquire an entertainment technology company such as Netflix to utilize its huge cash pile, according to CNBC.TechnologyinvestorEric Jackson has already said that Apple ""clearly should have bought Netflix.""The Cupertino, California-based company stated earlier that it is looking to double its service revenue, which includes the AppStore, by 2020.However, despite having a cash pile of over $240 billion, the company has been shying away from making major acquisitions, and Netflix has not given any hints about entertaining even the thought of being acquired.Apple Inc.

About 80% of the total revenue was generated by games in 2016.Apple does not give a breakdown of App Store spending.

HP Inc. (HPQ) Earnings & Revenues Surpass Estimates in Q1;2/23/2017;"makeZacksArticleAd();HP Inc.HPQreleased its first-quarter fiscal 2017 earnings yesterday, after its split from Hewlett-Packard Company. The company reported better-than-expected results for the first quarter, wherein both its top and bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Following the results, shares of the company went up more than 2% in after-hours trading yesterday.The company reported non-GAAP earnings per share of 38 cents per share, which came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. Also, earnings increased from the year-ago figure of 36 cents per share.Notably, Hewlett-Packard Company split itself into two standalone companies - HP Inc. and Hewlett-Packard EnterpriseHPE- effective Nov 1, 2015. Post the split, its PC and printer business has been operating as HP Inc., while Hewlett-Packard Enterprise specializes in commercial tech products.The stock has gained approximately 50.28% over the last one year, outperforming the Zacks categorizedComputer-Mini Computersindustry's return of 41.27%.Quarter in DetailHP's total revenue increased 3.6% year over year to $12.684 billion and came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $11.774 billion. The better-than-expected top-line performance was driven mainly by strength in the Personal System segment and outperformance of newly launched products.The Personal Systems segment garnered revenues of $8.224 billion compared with $7.476 billion reported in the year-ago quarter.  Commercial revenues increased 7%, while Consumer revenues increased 15%. The company witnessed an 8% rise in total shipments mainly driven by a 12% increase in Notebook unit shipment, while Desktops unit shipments were flat on a year-over-year basis.As expected, Printing revenues were down 3% year over year to $4.483 billion, primarily due to a 3% plunge in supplies revenues. HP's total hardware unit sales increased 6% primarily due to an increase of 2% in Commercial hardware units and a 7% increase in Consumer hardware units.Non-GAAP gross margin was down 100 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis to 18.7% primarily due to higher cost of sales. Total adjusted operating expenses decreased 1.8% year over year to $1.345 billion. Non-GAAP operating margin from continuing operations contracted 40 bps to 7.1% mainly due to unfavorable foreign currency impact and higher marketing spending expenses for demand generation.HP's non-GAAP net income from continuing operations came in at $655 million or 38 cents per share, compared with $645 million or 36 cents per share reported a year ago.Balance Sheet and Cash FlowHP ended the fiscal first quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $6.331 billion compared with $6.288 billion in the previous quarter. The company had long-term debt of $6.688 billion, compared with $6.758 billion last quarter.The company generated cash flow of $767 million from operational activities during the quarter. During the same period, the company repurchased 25.5 million shares and paid dividends worth $227 million.GuidanceFor fiscal second quarter, HP projects non-GAAP earnings in a range of 37 cents to 40 cents per share (mid-point: 38.5 cents). The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 39 cents.HP reiterated the fiscal 2017 earnings guidance. The company continues to anticipate non-GAAP earnings per share in a band of $1.55-$1.65 (mid-point: $1.6). The Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at $1.60 per share.Our TakeHP reported better-than-expected first-quarter fiscal 2017 results driven mainly by strength in Personal System and execution of restructuring actions and productivity initiatives.  However, the company provided not so encouraging forthcoming and fiscal 2017 earnings guidance.We are impressed by the performance of HP Inc.'s PC segment, wherein the year-over-year increase was witnessed mainly due to growth in Commercial and Consumer revenues.HP's efforts to turn around the business have been commendable. The company is working on product innovation and differentiation as well as enhancing the capabilities of the printing business to stabilize the top line.Furthermore, looking at the data compiled by two independent research firms - Gartner and International Data Corporation - we believe that the downtrend in PC shipments showed signs of stabilization in fourth-quarter 2016, compared with the previous quarters.Notably, for HP, this was the third consecutive quarter of year-over-year shipment growth following five back-to-back quarters of underperformance. The company witnessed a 4.3% increase in PC shipments and raised its market share to 20.4% from 18.8% in the year-ago quarter. We believe that the company's ongoing restructuring initiatives will result in lower costs, while enhancing both productivity and profitability.However, macroeconomic challenges and tepid IT spending remain near-term concerns.

Tesla Inc (TSLA) Is Making a Giant Push in Its Supercharger Network;2/23/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) has already run into issues with congestion at Supercharger locations. There are also areas of the country where charge stations are few and far between. With the affordable Model 3 on track to go into mass production in September, what is now an annoyance to customers could quickly become a real problem.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockTesla is getting ahead of the issue by accelerating the growth of its Supercharger network, with plans to double the number of North American Supercharger locations in 2017.Tesla's Supercharger Network Is Critical to EVs' SuccessTransitioning from gasoline-fueled automobiles to electric cars isn't just a matter of convincing consumers to spend a little more on the initial purchase price. The technology, green cred and especially the potential long-term fuel savings go a long way toward overcoming any initial sticker shock.The big problem is range anxiety.7 Marvelous Mid-Cap Stocks to Buy for the Best of All WorldsRegular drivers don't worry about running out of gas because there is a vast network of gas stations across the country. With an estimated150,000 gas stations in the U.S.(in 2015), you are seldom more than a few minutes away from being able to refuel. Once there, it's typically five or 10 minutes to gas up, pay and be back on the road.Electric cars like those made by TSLA have the advantage of being able to be charged at home, but that takes a long time. According to Tesla's figures, half an hour on a home charger gets about 27 miles of driving range. And that doesn't help when you're traveling.The company has been building up a Supercharger network that takes on the role of gas stations. A Supercharger is capable of adding 270 miles of driving range in 30 minutes, and can fully charge a Tesla Model S with 90 kWh battery in roughly 75 minutes.Each Supercharger location isestimated to cost TSLA between $100k and $175kto build, taking 12-20 weeks to complete.TSLA Will Double Its North American Locations in 2017Tesla's Supercharger network has two challenges.First, it is much, much thinner than the nation's network of gas stations. In all of the U.S. Canada and Mexico,Tesla currently has just 373 Supercharger locations, with 2,636 connections. Many of those Supercharger locations are concentrated on the east and west coasts.Then there is the charging time. While filling your car with enough gas to go 500 miles might take five or 10 minutes, fully charging a base Model S takes 75 minutes.With Tesla ownership limited to early adopters with relatively deep pockets, the sparse Supercharger network has mostly been an annoyance - something Tesla owners learn to work around. With the Model 3 slated to go into production in September and kick off a wave of mass market Tesla ownership, those annoyances risk becoming a serious problem.Early adopters may be willing to work around challenges, but average consumers quickly turn against a product that requires them to jump through hoops.In its full-year 2016 update letter to investors,TSLA announced that is tackling the issue:""We plan to accelerate expansion of the Supercharger network this year, starting with doubling our number of North American Supercharger locations in 2017.""Expansion and New Charging PoliciesDoubling the number of North American Supercharger locations helps to address range anxiety by filling in some of those areas on the map that are currently blank. Since each location has multiple Superchargers, it also significantly expands the number of Tesla cars that can be charging at any given time.Tesla can't do much about the time needed to charge one of its cars - at least with current technology - but it has implemented several policies in the past few months to help deal with congestion at its Supercharger network.Weibo Corp (ADR) (WB) Stock Goes Cold Despite Hot Q4 EarningsIn December,TSLA announced an idle fee(billed by the minute) would be charged to Tesla owners who parked their vehicles at Superchargers and left them connected. Then in January it announced theend of unlimited free Supercharger accessfor new Tesla buyers going forward.Withclose to 400,000 of the $35k Model 3s pre-ordered- and a goal of producing 500k electric vehicles a year by 2018 - the pressure is on TSLA to ensure its Supercharger network can meet the coming flood of demand. The policy changes will help, but ultimately Tesla needs to expand its network of chargers to provide the coverage and availability drivers expect.Doubling the number of North American Supercharger locations this year will be costly, but is a necessary move for Tesla to go mass market.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceApple Inc.

Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd (ADR) (TEVA) Stock Is CRAZY Cheap;2/23/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTeva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd (ADR)(NYSE:TEVA) desperately needed some good news heading into its fourth quarter earnings report. TEVA stock hit its lowest level in over a decade the week before, after its CEO resigned abruptly.makeArticleAd();Source:Open Grid Scheduler (Modified)The departure of CEO Erez Vigodman came amidst reports of bribery investigations in the company's home country of Israel. And it came after a long decline in TEVA stock, driven by pricing pressure, questionable acquisitions, and a ""patent cliff"" for Teva Pharmaceutical's key drug, Copaxone.And while Q4 earnings delivered, the news wasn't great. Revenue increased 33%, but that came almost solely from the acquisition ofAllergan plc's(NYSE:AGN) generics business. Teva Pharmaceutical paid $40.5 billion in a transaction that has boosted sales as well as Teva's debt load. Margins were pressured, reflected in non-GAAP EPS that increased just 8% despite the 33% rise in sales.But the company also reaffirmed 2017 non-GAAP EPS guidance of $4.90-$5.30. That eased fears of another reduction in the 2017 outlook, which had been cut in January from $6-$6.50. The news was enough to drive a ""relief rally"" in TEVA stock, which now has climbed more than 10% from its lows.There should be more upside ahead, even if the road might be bumpy. Teva does have numerous risks, both near-term and long-term. But it also has tremendous potential, a cheap multiple, and a new CEO on the way. There's a turnaround opportunity in TEVA stock and it doesn't look quite priced in.Why It's Crazy to Buy Teva StockAdmittedly, there are concerns across the board for Teva stock. Thepatent invalidationfor Copaxone, a multiple sclerosis treatment, puts an estimated 20% of revenue, and possibly 40%-plus of profit, at risk. On the Q4 call, CFO Eyal Desheh estimated an $800 million cash flow impact in 2017, should competition enter immediately.That entrance - which would occur if Teva loses its appeal - also would shave 75 to 95 cents off EPS.The combination of lower earnings and higher debt after the Allergan deal raises another risk. Teva's leverage ratio (net debt to EBITDA) at the end of 2016 was 4.7. That doesn't imply immediate risk of bankruptcy, to be sure. But Teva bonds that mature in 2026 have fallen about 12% just since September. Clearly, the debt markets are pricing in a greater, if still modest, possibility of a restructuring that could wipe out TEVA stock.The company now faces the challenge of finding a new CEO.Both previous CEOsleft relatively quickly, amid questions of fit within Teva's culture and clashes with the company's board. The company's current bylaws require the CEO to reside in Israel, though it's possible those could be changed for the next candidate.9 Best Cheap Stocks to Buy Now Under $9.99The bear case for TEVA stock is that, yes, it is cheap - and for good reason. Declining profits, a $36 billion debt load, concerns about generic pricing, and the loss of Copaxone all present significant risks. And those risks justify a 7x multiple to the midpoint of 2017 EPS guidance.Why Teva Stock Is a Buy NonethelessThose concerns are valid. But they're also backward-looking.Teva has numerous options to improve its situation, and interim CEO Yitzhak Peterburg said on the Q4 call that Teva would ""leave no stone unturned"" in considering those options.And what's important to keep in mind is that the situation isn't all that dire. Yes, bonds have fallen; but the yield to maturity still is just 4.4%, implying a very low chance of bankruptcy over the next decade. The leverage ratio could move above 5x if Copaxone competition moves in; but that remains a manageable level. This isn'tValeant Pharmaceuticals Intl Inc(NYSE:VRX); Teva's back isn't against the wall.The company has options. TEVA is targeting a 3.5x leverage ratio, and likely will consider asset sales as a path to those levels. There's still the possibility of a split between the branded and generic businesses, something Wall Street has long targeted. (That decision appears up to the new CEO, per the Q4 call.)Copaxone sales and profits aren't going to zero, even if generic competition enters immediately. And the same goes for Teva Pharmaceutical earnings. This remains the largest generic drug manufacturer in the world based on revenue. With rising health care costs a concern pretty much everywhere, and drug pricing a key part of those concerns, that's a major long-term competitive advantage for Teva.The Apple iPhone 8 Will Be Revolutionary (AAPL)And TEVA stock is cheap - even assuming the worst about Copaxone. Using the low end of 2017 guidance and the high end of the guided Copaxone impact still puts 2017 EPS near $4, and TEVA stock's P/E multiple below 10. Simply stabilizing the business at those levels likely implies a 12-13 multiple - and gets TEVA stock to $50.It's always difficult to time the bottom in any stock. But the Q4 earnings from Teva Pharmaceutical seem to imply that the company at least has a handle on its challenges. Looking forward, the debt load isn't so big that the company is forced to do anything, and a new CEO will bring fresh eyes.There are concerns, to be sure. But Teva Pharmaceutical has a lot of tools still at its disposal to answer those concerns, and push TEVA stock higher.The author has no position in any securities mentioned.More From InvestorPlace9 Best Cheap Stocks to Buy Now Under $9.997 Tech Stocks With Explosive Growth PotentialWatch Cisco Systems, Inc.

A Slight Negative for This Apple Inc. Supplier Emerges;2/23/2017;"Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd.(NYSE: TSM) is the world's largest contract chip manufacturer. It   manufactures chips for some of the largest, most powerful   companies likeApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) as well as for small chip companies you might not   have ever heard of.TSMC is in the unique situation of having a very strong   position inside of Apple's iPhone line of smartphones -- it is   believed to be the exclusive manufacturer of Apple's   custom-designed A10 processor and it is also believed to be the   manufacturer of theQualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM) Snapdragon X12 andIntel(NASDAQ: INTC) XMM 7360 cellular modems found inside of each   iPhone sold today.Image source: Intel.makeArticleAd();Going forward, it looks as though TSMC is set to see revenues   from iPhone cellular modems vanish.Gone either this cycle, or nextIf Apple chooses to reuse the Snapdragon X12 modem as well as   adopt Intel's XMM 7480 cellular modem for the upcoming iPhone   product cycle, then TSMC should enjoy another year of cellular   modem revenues (since the XMM 7480 is also believed to be   manufactured at TSMC).However, after that it is likely that Apple will adopt the   Intel XMM 7560 cellular modem as well as either the Qualcomm   Snapdragon X16 or Snapdragon X20 modem (if it doesn't ultimately   adopt one of them this cycle).The Snapdragon X16 is manufactured bySamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) on its 14-nanometer LPP technology and the   Snapdragon X20 is manufactured by Samsung using its 10-nanometer   LPE technology.The Intel XMM 7560 is, unlike previous Intel modems,   manufactured by Intel itself using some variant of its   14-nanometer manufacturing technology.So, at some point within the next iPhone cycle or two, Apple   is likely going to be sourcing modems from both Qualcomm and   Intel that aren't manufactured by TSMC.What does this mean for TSMC's business?If we assume that this business is worth something on the   order of $1 billion in annual revenue (200 million units   multiplied by a rough estimate of $5 per unit), then -- all else   equal -- TSMC stands to see a roughly 3% revenue decline from the   eventual loss of this business (based on current analyst   consensus which calls for TSMC to rake in about $32.22 billion in   revenue this year).That's certainly less than ideal, but such a loss isn't going   to dramatically impact the company's financial position. After   all, the company still benefits from the growth of the overall   smartphone market (as it is a critical supplier of many key   smartphone processor makers) and I wouldn't be surprised to see   silicon content within smartphones continue to grow in the years   ahead as smartphones continue to integrate more features and   functionality.In other words, TSMC should be able to more than make up the   potential declines elsewhere within the mobile market.What about for Intel's and Samsung's?Samsung's contract chip manufacturing business used to rely on   the manufacture of Apple's A-series applications processors, but   it seems to have lost that business to TSMC for the foreseeable   future. Getting some logic silicon content in the iPhone again   via the manufacture of Qualcomm's modems certainly can't   hurt.A similar argument applies to Intel. The company is looking to   expand its total addressable market partly to grow revenue and   partly to continue to have enough chip scale to keep its   expensive factories filled with chips. By manufacturing and   shipping tens of millions, if not more than 100 million cellular   baseband chips (eventually) annually, the company has quite a lot   of ""guaranteed"" volume for its factories year-in and   year-out.In other words, I'd say that TSMC losing business to Intel and   Samsung is probably more of a positive for the latter two's   businesses than it is a negative for TSMC.Offer from The Motley Fool: The 10 best stocks to buy       nowMotley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent     more than a decade beating the market.

Thursday’s Vital Data: Bank of America Corp (BAC), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) and Freeport-McMoRan Inc (FCX);2/23/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsU.S. stock futures are headed higher this morning, as theDow Jones Industrial Averagelooks to bank its 10th-consecutive winning session. Yesterday's positive finish marked the longest streak of all-time-high closes for the Dow since 1987. Oil prices are helping to boost sentiment this morning, with crude oil up 1.5% $54.40 per barrel after the American Petroleum Institute showed an 884,000-barrel decline in U.S. crude supplies last week.makeArticleAd();Heading into the open, futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average have added 0.1%, withS&P 500futures up 0.1% andNasdaq-100futures edging 0.08% higher.On the options front, volume was anemic on Wednesday, with only about 13.8 million calls and 12.3 million puts changing hands on the session. Over on the CBOE, the single-session equity put/call volume ratio came in at 0.60, while the 10-day moving average tagged its third-consecutive two-month low, also at 0.6.Turning to Wednesday's volume leaders,Bank of America Corp(NYSE:BAC) continued to see heavy call volume after news that BAC stock is a top holding among the biggest hedge funds. Elsewhere,Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMD) remains a hot options topic ahead of next week's 2017 Game Developers Conference and the release of its latest CPU chipset.Finally,Freeport-McMoRan Inc(NYSE:FCX) continues to tank after not reaching a deal with Indonesia for its Grasberg copper mine.Bank of America Corp (BAC)With the promise of higher interest rates and lax regulations under the Donald Trump administration, financials are hot - so hot that hedge funds are piling into the sector left and right.According to a FactSet report, ""The top 50 hedge funds bought $3.5 billion worth of stock in the financials group during the fourth quarter,"" with BofA making up $1.5 billion of those investments.What's more, BAC stock was also the second largest purchase overall for hedge funds in the fourth quarter.7 Ultra-Cheap Value Stocks to Buy NowBAC options traders gravitated heavily toward the stock in yesterday's activity following the report, with 821,000 contracts changing hands. Furthermore, 75% of Wednesday's activity was comprised of call options activity. Looking out to the March series, BAC options traders are betting big on a continued rally.Currently, the put/call open interest ratio for the series comes in at 0.47, meaning that calls more than double puts in March. With hints that another rate hike could be in the offering from the Fed, these calls may be speculative bets on a positive outcome for BAC stock.Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD)It's a rally that just won't quit. Despite increased volatility, AMD stock continues to march higher on the prospects of a strong 2017 performance. Next week's2017 Game Developers Conferenceoffers another potential up-leg for AMD stock, as the event is expected to coincide with the early March release of the company's latest Ryzen CPU chipset - which is reportedly cheaper and just as powerful asIntel Corporation's(NASDAQ:INTC) top-of-the-line i7 chips.AMD options speculators are out in force ahead of the event, with Wednesday's volume near 406,000 contracts. What's more, calls made up an above average 72% of the day's take, indicating continued bullish confidence from the speculative options crowd. That said, AMD has already eclipsed short-term options targets at $13.50 and $14, with both strikes representing peak call OI in the March series. The next upside target is the March $15 call strike, where 12,600 contracts reside. If Ryzen lives up to the pre-release performance and pricing hype, expect AMD stock to hit $15 in short order.Freeport-McMoRan Inc (FCX)Back on Feb. 13, I noted that with copper prices soaring Freeport-McMoRan stock could be on the verge of a significant rally, if only it could get a deal done with Indonesia on its Grasberg mine. That deal appears to have fallen through, however, and so has FCX stock. The shares have plunged more than 8.5% since Tuesday afterFreeport and Indonesian officials failed to reach an agreement.Apple Inc. (AAPL) iPhone 8 Camera Will Be RevolutionaryThe news also promptedDeutsche Bank to downgrade FCX stockto ""sell"" from ""hold"" and cut its price target to $12 from $14.Options traders appeared to hold a smidgen of hope for a rebound, however, as calls made up 52% of the more than 302,000 contracts traded on FCX stock yesterday. That said, opinions have soured over the past week, with the March put/call OI ratio rising from 0.53 to its current perch at 0.69.In fact, recent call activity could be closures to limit losses, or even short sellers hedging new positions on FCX. With Grasberg out of commission, FCX stock could be in trouble for the time being.As of this writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace7 Tech Stocks That Could Implode at Any Minute9 Top Pharmaceutical Stocks to Buy for the DividendsThe postThursday's Vital Data: Bank of America Corp (BAC), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

A veteran Apple analyst reports the new iPhone 8 will feature a revolutionary new 3D FaceTime camera. This will allow Apple to incorporate high-tech features like facial recognition, and could be the missing piece that lets the company push into augmented reality.9to5 Macpublished details of a report,released yesterday by KGI Securitiesanalyst Ming-Chi Kuo. According to Kuo, iPhone 8 won't push the limits of the primary camera the way the dual-lens system on the iPhone 7 Plus did. Instead, it will get a new FaceTime camera he describes a ""revolutionary.""7 Consumer Stocks That Will Knock Your Socks OffThe KGI report says the new camera will incorporate an advanced infrared sensor, and employ technology developed byPrimeSense- the Israeli 3D sensor companyApple bought in 2013. Together, the camera lens, IR transmitter and IR receiver will be able to accurately track the depth and location of objects. In other words, an advanced 3D sensing system.KGI even has the component manufacturers identified. Ming-Chi Kuo saysSony Corp (ADR)(NYSE:SNE) will produce the FaceTime camera module.Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., Ltd(OTCMKTS:HNHPF) - Foxconn to you and me - is expected to make the IR sensors.Lumentum Holdings Inc(NASDAQ:LITE) will provide laser technology.

So what's the point of packingthiscamera with advanced technology? Better selfies?By going this route, the iPhone 8 gains a number of significant features that have previously been hinted at. The system could be used for 3D facial recognition and/or iris scanning. This advanced biometric capability would be more secure than the current Touch ID fingerprint system and could help AAPL to drive Apple Pay adoption. Facial recognition would also be a hig- tech selling feature.The technology would also support Apple's augmented reality ambitions. We've previously written about how Apple CEO Tim Cook has been increasingly vocal about AR and its potential to be a game-changing technology. That promotion has stepped up in the past year, leading to speculation AAPL is preparing to release a product with augmented reality as a key feature.The iPhone 8's new FaceTime camera - with its 3D capabilities - could be that bigAR announcementwe've been anticipating. The KGI report suggests the iPhone 8's camera could scan the user's face and generate 3D selfies (thereit is).Besides the ultra-cool selfie capability, these images could them be stitched into applications, such as games.IPhone 8 on Track to Be a High-Tech LeaderWe're certain AAPL will be sparing no expense when it comes to making iPhone 8 a visual standout. It will have a bold new design - likely all glass with a stainless steel band and bezel-free OLED display.But the KGI report on the new FaceTime camera suggests it will also be a technology standout. Biometric security and AR support are looking to be key features. The new camera brings together a number of AAPL's past acquisitions, helps to explain that rumored $1,000+ price tag and puts Tim Cook's ongoing pep talks about AR into perspective.Apple Park: Apple Inc (AAPL) Sets Grand Opening for 'Spaceship' CampusAnd according to KGI, the technology Apple has assembled for the iPhone 8 is ""years ahead of Android.""

PowerShares QQQ Trust (QQQ): Short the Titans of Tech;2/23/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe rally inPowerShares QQQ Trust, Series 1 (ETF)(NASDAQ:QQQ) has reached epic proportions as the tech rally moves relentlessly higher on a daily basis. Like all good things, however, it will eventually come to an end. And the end is nigh for the Nasdaq. I expect QQQ to have a meaningful pullback over the coming few weeks.makeArticleAd();QQQ is comprised of the top 100 Nasdaq stocks, with the largest five holdings comprising nearly 40% of the index. These are the heavyweights of tech, with names likeApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL),Microsoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT),Amazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN),Facebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) andAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL).While the valuations given to AMZN and FB have always been rich (or perhaps absurd), now even Apple, the biggest component of the QQQ, is no longer the value stock is was a year ago. AAPL currently sports a price-to-earnings multiple over 16, by far the highest over the past year.Click to EnlargeYear-to-date, the QQQ is up a stunning 10%. To put that in a different context, if the Q's maintained the torrid pace of the rally, it would end up the year with a gain of 97.8%. Of the 34 trading days this year, QQQ has been up 27 days and down only seven.In February, there have been 12 up days and only two down days, with the two down days only being 11 cents and 4 cents.Certainly might be difficult to sustain that type of pace going forward.7 Ultra-Cheap Value Stocks to Buy NowThe Q's are by far the most overbought in the past two years with a 14-day RSI reading over 85. Readings at these extremes are rare indeed, especially for an index or ETF.Click to EnlargeImplied volatility (IV) is priced at the lowest levels over that time frame, meaning option prices are cheap, trading at only 4%. Yesterday saw notable put trading in the QQQ, with an inordinate amount of put selling. This type of action is usually indicative of tops in the underlying shares.So with the Q's at grossly overbought levels and with option prices dirt cheap, taking a bearish position using long put options makes a lot of sense.QQQ Trade IdeaBuy QQQ March $130 puts at $1.50 or better.These are the at-the-money puts and cost only 1.1% the price of the QQQ. With IV at low levels, gamma is high, meaning these options are poised to move. A mere 2% pullback over the coming few weeks would result in a doubler for these options.Those wishing to defray some of the exposure could elect to sell shorter-term weekly options against the long traditional Mar $130 puts.As of this writing, Tim Biggam did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Today, we'll look at that and otherApple Rumorsfor Wednesday.makeArticleAd();Source: AppleMacBook Pro Keyboards:Some owners of the 2016 MacBook Pro are having trouble with its keyboard, reportsMacRumors. Owners of the devices have taken to Apple's official support forums to air their complaints. The problems include keys not working, lack of a uniform feel and high-pitched sounds coming from some keys when pressed. Many of these customers have noted that the problems are most prevalent when the laptop is warm.iCloud.net Purchase:AAPL has purchased the domain for iCloud.net,TechCrunchnotes. The tech company bought the domain without any major announcement. It has been working to obtain domains related to its services lately. The iCloud.net domain was owned by a small Asian social networking company. This company has announced to users that the service is shutting down. This puts AAPL one step closer to owning all of the domains connected to its iCloud service. However, it still needs to get its hands on iCloud.co.uk.Cambridge Siri Lab:Apple has finally confirmed the existence of its Siri research and development lab in Cambridge, U.K., reportsAppleInsider. The company has put up a sign outside of the building that has its logo on it. The lab was the subject of rumors and many leaks lead people to believe that it is indeed an research and development lab for Siri.

Why Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Needs a New Growth Driver;2/22/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe bull/bear argument for and againstApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) stock is pretty simple. AAPL stock bulls argue that the stock is simply too cheap. Apple is a great company, with roughly $30 per share in net cash; yet Apple stock trades at basically 10x next year's earnings plus cash. Investors are acting as if Apple earnings will decline going forward - which makes no sense for what remains the world's most popular consumer goods company (and the world's most valuable stock).makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockBears reply, in essence, that AAPL stockshouldget a multiple befitting a declining company. As popular as the iPhone is, competition is intense, and only getting tougher.And as smartphones become more commoditized, the edge that the iPhone has over, say, aSamsung(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) Galaxy - let alone Chinese competitors - will narrow. That should pressure pricing, margins and Apple shares.With Apple stock at an all-time high, the bulls are winning the argument at the moment. But from a long-term standpoint, the bears have a point. AAPL may not be the next Gateway Computer, but commoditization is a risk. Apple needs another growth driver to keep its stock rising over the long-term. The company hasn't quite found the right product yet; however, and it's not sure what it will be.Apple Stock Has Been Valued Based on the iPhoneIt's not hard to come to the conclusion that AAPL stock is directly correlated to iPhone sales. It was iPhone-driven optimism that drove Apple shares from under $100 (pre-split; equivalent to ~$12.50 now) in 2009 to $100 by 2012. Since then, Apple stock has declined sharply twice.The 10 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold ForeverThe first time was in 2013. In fiscal 2013 (AAPL fiscal years end in September), the iPhone growth rate slowed sharply: iPhone unit sales growth dropped from 73% in FY12 to 20.2% in FY13, and those fears knocked down Apple shares. The second decline came in between 2015 and 2016, during a year where iPhone revenuedropped12% year-over-year on an 8% decrease in unit sales.Looking backwards, it certainly seems like AAPL stock is driven by sentiment toward the iPhone. There's one key reason for that: the rest of Apple has been consistently, and almost incredibly stagnant. Here's Apple revenue ex-iPhone sales over the last five fiscal years (per AAPL filings):2012: $77.8 billion2013: $79.6 billion2014: $80.8 billion2015: $78.7 billion2016: $78.9 billionObviously, those sales have come from different sources. Mac revenues have been relatively stable, in the $21 to $25 billion range. iPod sales have faded, but have been offset by the modest growth in Apple Watch sales, leaving ""other products"" revenues rather flat. iPad sales have fallen from $32 billion in FY13 to barely $20 billion last year; growth in services (iTunes, Apple Music, Apple Pay, etc.) has offset that decline.But the point is that, other than the iPhone, Apple stock really isn't a growth stock. In fact, it looks a lot like the bears view Apple as a whole. And that raises the question of if AAPL can become a true growth stock, and drive upside from its current all-time highs.But AAPL Stock Needs Another HitAt this point, I wouldn't bet against AAPL stock, but I'm skeptical the company can really drive growth beyond the iPhone. A simple breakdown of the ~$79 billion in trailing twelve-month non-iPhone revenue shows there really isn't much in the pipeline. $23 billion (30%) comes from Mac notebooks and desktops. That's a great, high-margin product, but overall desktop/notebook sales are declining and Mac revenue declined 10% in FY16 (it did rise 7% in Q1 FY17); $19 billion (24%) comes from the iPad.Those sales are declining, falling 23% in FY15, 11% in FY16 and a concerning 22% in Q1. Services revenue is double what it was after FY12, and drives about one-third of non-iPhone revenue. But those businesses still comprise just ~12% of total sales.Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Is Itching to Break All-Time HighsOther products make up the rest of non-iPhone revenue, with that segment including Beats headphones, Apple TV, the iPod (yes, Apple still sells them) and, of course, Apple Watch. Apple Watch has been cited as a potential driver for AAPL stock, but Apple still doesn't break out revenue. CEO Tim Cook did say on the AAPL Q1 earnings call that Watch sales hit an all-time high in the December quarter.But ""other products"" sales over the last four quarters still are under $11 billion. That's about 5% of total revenue. And Apple Watch is only a portion of those sales.iPhone Reliance Could Hurt Apple StockAnd that's the key problem for Apple stock at the highs, in my opinion. The iPhone is so dominant that everything else pares in comparison. The Apple Watch would be considered a success for nearly every company on Earth. But its revenue over the last year is probably, at best, in the range of $6 billion. Over the same period, the iPhone generated$139 billionin revenue.The point is that AAPL stock remains indistinguishable from the iPhone. Apple Watch, Apple Pay, Beats and other ancillary products are good products, and drive excellent sales. But the iPhone is such a phenomenon that they almost don't matter - and it's almost impossible to create a product that can drive anywhere near that level of success. And I believe that creates a long-term risk for AAPL stock, even if that risk isn't playing out at the moment.As of this writing, Vince Martin did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceThe 10 Best Oil Stocks to Buy Now for Big-Time Gains7 S&P 500 Stocks Poised For Explosive GrowthThe postWhy Apple Inc.

4 Stocks at 52-Week Highs That Are Still Worth Buying Today;2/22/2017;"While we Fools are generally bargain hunters, we recognize   that some companies are so fantastic that it can make sense to   buy them while they're on the upswing. With that in mind, we   asked a team of Fools to each highlight a stock trading near its   52-week that is still worth buying today. Read on to see why they   selectedVisa(NYSE: V) ,Brookfield Infrastructure Partners(NYSE: BIP) ,Paycom Software(NYSE: PAYC) , andApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) .Charge ahead with this payment-network giantDan Caplinger(Visa):Financial stocks have skyrocketed since the presidential election   in November, as investors hope that deregulation in the banking   and investment industry will lead to faster growth and new   prospects for business expansion in the months and years ahead.   Yet Visa stands to win in a couple of ways, and it's better   positioned to prosper no matter what happens to the global   economy and the state of regulation in the U.S. financial   industry going forward.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();Unlike banks, Visa carries no credit risk with its payment   network. Instead, it simply takes a small cut of transactions   using its infrastructure, and as more people use electronic   payments to make purchases, Visa has carved out its share of the   growing market.There are a couple of reasons to be bullish on Visa even after   its big share-price gains. First, most indications suggest that   the economic expansion is continuing in the U.S., and that should   spur greater consumer activity that can help contribute to   greater overall purchase and transaction volumes. Also, Visa   recently acquired Visa Europe, reintegrating its global   operations and putting it in a position to benefit from   recoveries elsewhere in the world. Combine that with emerging   market economies where consumers are only now starting to adopt   electronic payments, and you can see how Visa could continue to   make progress despite already having rewarded shareholders with   25% gains over the past year.Riding high but undervaluedMatt DiLallo(Brookfield Infrastructure Partners):Units of Brookfield Infrastructure Partners are up more than 50%   over the past year, recently hitting a new 52-week high. Fueling   that growth was the company's strong showing in 2016 when it grew   funds from operations (FFO) by 17% after completing a slew of   growth projects and acquisitions. Those strategic growth   initiatives enabled the company to increase its distribution by   11% for 2017.The company still has plenty of growth left in the pipeline.   In fact, it has added $1.4 billion in new organic projects to its   backlog and is close to closing three more acquisitions. These   new additions have the potential to drive FFO up double digits   again this year if everything goes according to plan, well   ahead of the company's long-term guidance for 5% to 9% annual FFO   growth.That said, despite the robust growth in the pipeline,   Brookfield's units trade for a higher yield compared to its   peers. Because of that, Brookfield believes the market has   significantly undervalued its units. In fact, as the following   slide suggests, units would trade for around $50 if the market   valued its yield closer to the peer group average:Image source: Brookfield Infrastructure Partners Investor     Presentation.While units aren't quite as undervalued as they had been,   they're still a bargain compared to what Brookfield believes   they're worth. That suggests the potential for more upside on the   horizon, especially as the company continues building and buying   assets that grow its cash flow and distribution. Speaking of   which, at a nearly 5% yield, investors get paid a pretty penny   while waiting for the market to wake up and realize that   Brookfield still trades at a hefty discount.A boring but mission-critical serviceBrian Feroldi(Paycom Software):I don't know many people that would show up at work if they   weren't receiving a paycheck. Employers certainly know this, too,   which is why they take payroll processing so seriously. And yet,   legacy payroll systems can be a big hassle to deal with since   they generally don't play well with other HR systems.Chad Richinson certainly understands this dilemma, which is   why he founded Paycom Software back in 1998. His solution was to   create a software system that handled multiple HR functions from   a single, cloud-based system, thereby making it far more   attractive to employers.Paycom's solution has proven to be a big hit with small and   medium-sized businesses everywhere. The company now counts more   than 17,800 clients on its platform. With more employers signing   on every day, Paycom's revenue and profits have been soaring.Paycom'sstrong growth rateshave certainly caught Wall Street's attention, pushing its   stock to a fresh 52-week high. Taking a closer look at the   company's performance, it is not hard to figure out why Wall   Street is excited. Revenue grew by 35% and exceeded expectations.   Net income soared by 80% and also blasted past analyst's   projections. Customer retention rates remain strong, and   management is guiding for revenue growth of nearly 30% in   2017.While Paycom's stock is most certainly pricey -- the company's   trailing PE ratio is 71 -- I can't help but feel that the   blistering revenue growth and soaring profitability more than   justify its high valuation. That puts Paycom high on my shopping   list, even though shares have already enjoyed a great run.Apple is still a screaming buyTravis Hoium(Apple):Critics can criticize Apple's level of innovation or the   design of the new iPhone or Macs, but it's tough to criticize the   company's incredible earnings machine. The company has a net cash   balance of $158.5 million and in the last year earned $45.2   billion. And the company doesn't show any sign of letting up its   earnings power.The iPhone has become such a powerful device that customers   are locked into the Apple ecosystem almost from the moment they   buy one. And owning an iPhone makes customers more likely to buy   a Mac, Apple TV, iPad, or even AirPods. The fact that everything   works together so well, and operating system updates come   regularly is incredibly valuable if you've ever tried using   competitors like Android or Samsung's Smart TV operating   system.With Apple's shares at a 52-week high, the stock isn't as   attractive as it was a few months ago, and the 1.7% dividend   yield won't wow most investors. But shares still only trade at 16   times trailing earnings, and that's without considering the   $158.5 billion in net cash on the balance sheet. The iPhone is   also showing no signs of slowing down as a technology powerhouse,   and the ecosystem of products and apps surrounding the smartphone   will generate value for Apple for the foreseeable future. Even as   the largest company in the world, Apple is still a stock worth   buying.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Tech Stock Roundup: FB TV App, AAPL Original Content;2/22/2017;"Technology stocks had a relatively quiet week although there were increased signs that companies like FacebookFBand AppleAAPLwere getting more serious about not just content acquisition but also content creation. While this may not be in direct competition with NetflixNFLXit does look like competition for Alphabet'sGOOGLYouTube, Spotify and PandoraP. It's also definitely competition for eyeballs in what is limited free time for all-Facebook TV AppFacebook has launched a new TV app for Amazon Fire TV, Apple TV and Samsung Smart TV, with possible plans to further expand to other platforms like Microsoft Xbox, Sony PlayStation and other streaming devices. While this will likely enable/support longer video formats, Facebook has said its intention is not to compete with Netflix but rather to enable Facebook users to watch their preferred video on just about any screen of their choice (and that includes TV screens).Of course that's not the only video announcement Facebook made. The company says that henceforth, videos will play automatically with the sound turned on by default (if the device sound is turned on) and the window will retreat to the bottom corner of the screen so you can keep watching the video while scrolling through your newsfeed. Facebook says that testing is showing a positive reaction from users, although it's obvious that not everyone will be overjoyed.Facebook is also reportedly in talks with music labels to bring their content to the app, which seems like an open challenge to YouTube, Google's competing site. For labels, the new distribution channel will increase their leverage against YouTube for more favorable terms. On the flip side, the chances of piracy will increase given the nature of Facebook's free platform.The increased scope for advertising is also an indication that the company is gearing up to grab its share of TV ad dollars.Apple Getting Ready to Debut Reality ShowEddie Cue, Apple's SVP of Internet software and services used the Recode Media Conference to express a lot of enthusiasm for Apple's soon-to-be released ""Planet of the Apps"" reality show on its music subscription service. Contestants will get 60 seconds to explain their idea on an escalator and could win up to millions in venture capital funding if judges will.i.am, Jessica Alba, Gary Vaynerchuk and Gwyneth Paltrow approve. This is the first attempt by Apple to create original content and will likely be joined by Carpool Karaoke in April (Apple bought out the unscripted version of this show in the summer of last year).Google Fiber RestructuringAlphabet has been trimming staff at its Access unit, which is responsible for its high-speed Internet service called Fiber. But last week, the trimming was more in the nature of hacking as it transferred hundreds of employees to other units, retaining just enough to work in the field. The unit also has a new CEO in Greg McCray, who was formerly CEO of Aero Communications and currently also serves on the board of telecom company CenturyLink.The changes while significant are not really surprising, because Google has had a lot of trouble with Fiber not only because of the expense but also because of tussles with telecom companies over their control on telecom poles. In fact, ever since its acquisition of WebPass last year, speculation has been rife that the company will replace or reduce fiber deployment with a cheaper wireless service. That plan seems to have crystallized now as Google cuts staff but remains committed to expanding its Fiber service.CompanyLast WeekLast  6 MonthsAAPL+2.36%+22.12%FB+2.45%+7.12%GOOGL+1.79%+3.68%MSFT+0.50%+10.23%INTC-3.23%+0.86%CSCO+0.61%+1.61%AMZN+2.12%+7.94%Other stories you might have missed-CorporateAussie Banks Respond to Apple Statement: In response to Apple's contention that the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, National Australia Bank Ltd., Westpac Banking Corp. and Bendigo & Adelaide Bank Ltd were looking for a free ride, they have told the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission (ACCC) that on the contrary, Apple's policies attempted to prevent competition in wallets. Because if Apple allowed them access to its NFC antenna, they would pledge their participation in the Apple Pay rollout.Australian law allows such collective bargaining, provided it is approved by the government. In its draft ruling, the ACCC denied the banks' request. The final ruling is expected in March and in the meantime, the Australian Retailers Association have backed the banks, making their own submission that the collective negotiations would be beneficial for ""all banks, merchants, app developers and ultimately customers in Australia and overseas.""Facebook Seeks Independent Media Audit: Facebook has agreed to be audited by Media Rating Council, an industry body that advertisers trust for ad measurement metrics. Ad prices on the social network have been rising despite the fact that Facebook has repeatedly come out with statements seeking to rectify viewership numbers.The company has therefore been under slight pressure to mend relationships with advertisers. The agreement should increase transparency and instill confidence in advertisers, which are directly responsible for its bread and butter.Mark Zuckerberg Talks: The Facebook CEO wrote a long-winded essay sharing his long-term vision for the social network that mainly covered the importance of a global community in an increasingly individualistic world. The purpose of the ""mission statement"" wasn't really clear since most government bodies in the U.S. and elsewhere don't have a problem with people connecting on the social network and there aren't any bans as such on people connecting even if they later turn out to be terrorists. Of course Facebook has access to a boatload of data on people that governments might ask for (as they have been doing).New Technology/ProductsFacebook Gets into Recruitment Services: Facebook has found another use for its sprawling network: it is now connecting employers with employees. While LinkedIn (now part of Microsoft) has been around for a while, the site is more popular with higher-income groups. Facebook on the other hand has people from every walk of life and employers of every kind on its network, so it's in a very good position to corner a much larger section of the market than LinkedIn ever reached.Google Loon Tech Improves: Google's Project Loon may get to market sooner now that the company has found a way of moving them more efficiently. According to a blog post from Astro Teller, head of its moonshots division called Google X, the company now has the algorithms necessary to direct groups of balloons from their point of launch to their points of deployment (remote area where Internet access is required) within a few weeks. Earlier this took a few months.The announcement was made after the company successfully launched its Internet beaming balloons from Puerto Rico and directed them towards Peru. The loon project is already testing in Sri Lanka and Peru although testing in Indonesia, the other country that has approved the project, is yet to commence.Amazon Echo, Google Home Taking Calls: The home automation devices from Google and AmazonAMZNmay soon be equipped with phone calling capabilities according to the WSJ, which cited its sources. The idea is to keep users away from their phones as much as possible when in the house, so they don't get distracted into using other services like Facebook. Or maybe it's just to help people get their calls even when they have both hands full.AWS Launches Chime: Amazon's AWS has launched a video conferencing software suite called Chime that competes with Microsoft's Skype for Business, Cisco's WebEx and others. Other than the basic version for which it doesn't charge, a Plus version with IT admin tools and screen-sharing comes for $2.50 per user per month and a Pro version that supports upto 100 attendees at $15. Microsoft charges $5 and $12.50 for the Office 365 Business Essentials and Business Premium packages, respectively. Cisco charges $69 on the basis of the number of hosts, irrespective of the number of attendees.HP-Sure Click: HP has collaborated with Bromium to introduce a hardware based security solution for unsafe Internet browsing. The solution, called HP Sure Click is activated every time a user accesses the browser, which then isolates the browsing session from other files/documents. So if malware or other malicious software opens up, other tabs or the system itself remains uninfected.M&A and CollaborationsMicrosoft Collaborates with India's Tata Motors: The two companies have inked a technology collaboration deal that will see MicrosoftMSFTdeliver its connected vehicle technologies (artificial intelligence, machine learning, IoT) through Azure. In exchange, Tata Motors customers will have a better experience, whether by way of location-based points of interest, shopping centers or route assistance, or things like information on road conditions, vehicle health, etc.Some NumbersGoogle Leads in Digital Travel Ads: Based in part on a meeting with industry research firm Skift, RBC Capital analyst Mark Mahaney believes that Google will never grow into an online travel agency, i.e. it will never compete in travel fulfillment (including distribution and customer service). Skift estimates that Google accounted for 90% of travel ads in 2016, generating $12 billion in revenue.

Apple Park: Apple Inc (AAPL) Sets Grand Opening for ‘Spaceship’ Campus;2/22/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) is almost done with its Apple Park campus and is planning to start letting employees in soon.makeArticleAd();Source:FlickrApple Inc. says that it will be ready to start moving employees to the ""Spaceship"" campus in April. The tech company notes that construction will still continue on the Apple Park campus into the summer. It also expects it to take about six months to move the 12,000 employees from its old campus to the new one.While the Apple Park will finally be ready to open in April,Apple Inc. hasn't set down a definitive date for the grand opening. However, it did announce the naming of the location's new theatre. It will be named after AAPL co-founder Steve Jobs, who passed away in 2011.The Apple Park was part of Steve Jobs' vision. He was determined to make a campus that would allow employees to be more creative and achieve their ideas. The location takes an area previously filled with asphalt and covers it with green meadows, drought-resistant trees and more.One of the major design aspects of the Apple Park that sticks out is the main campus. This building is circular in shape, thus the Spaceship nickname. It is also made up of the largest sections of curved glass in the world. The building is 2.8 million square feet in size.Another interesting feature of the Apple Park is that it will run entirely off of renewable energy. This includes 17 megawatts of rooftop solar. The building is also designed with natural ventilation that should allow it to go for nine months per year without any heating or air conditioning.More From InvestorPlace7 Ultra-Cheap Value Stocks to Buy Now7 Tech Stocks That Could Implode at Any Minute9 Top Pharmaceutical Stocks to Buy for the DividendsThe postApple Park: Apple Inc (AAPL) Sets Grand Opening for 'Spaceship' Campusappeared first onInvestorPlace."

The Benefits Of Investing In Companies With A High Rate Of Discretionary Disclosure;2/22/2017;"ByStefano De Caterina:Corporate disclosure and shareholders' value     creationThe positive outcomes of discretionary disclosure are various   and can benefit both companies and their shareholders. I will   focus here on the benefits for the latter.Whilst the mandatory disclosure is imposed by legislation or   regulation (i.e. the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in the U.S. and the   European Transparency Directive in the E.U.), the discretionary   disclosure consists of any additional information a company's   management intends to provide the investors with.makeArticleAd();Most of the studies show that a disclosure increase creates   value for the shareholders. For instance, a study conducted by   Standard & Poor's shows (see the chart below) that companies   with higher transparency and disclosure (measured by the S&P   transparency score) have a higher P/BV ratio.Source: Standard & Poor'sThe S&P transparency score takes into account the quantity   of disclosure: the more information is given (i.e. information   about ownership structure and shareholders' rights, information   about board and management process, financial and operational   information), the higher the score is. The same research also   proves that firms with high disclosure and transparency have a   lower market risk as showed in the chart below:Source: Standard & Poor'sOther studies focusing on events such as the introduction of   regulation (i.e. the Sarbanes-Oxley Act) also verified and   confirmed that disclosure either mandatory or discretionary   creates value for the shareholders.A crucial role in conveying the disclosure to the investor is   played by the Investor Relations.The National Investor Relations Institute (NIRI) defines the   Investor Relations as the:""Strategic management responsibility that integrates       finance, communication, marketing and securities law       compliance to enable the most effective two-way communication       between a company, the financial community, and other       constituencies, which ultimately contributes to a company's       securities achieving fair valuation"".Based on this definition, we can assume that if a company   supplies its shareholders with a complete, timely, reliable,   punctual and adequate flow of financial information related to   its business, it will definitely help investors make better   investment decisions and allow its stock price to align   progressively with its fair value.In this sense, investor relations help share prices to achieve   a fair valuation. Value gaps between market value and fair value   tend to diminish because investors believe management can   accomplish what it says through the disclosure(management credibility).A flat or negative quarter will not be an automatic sell   signal because investors will seek for explanations by the   management and, when convinced that fundamentals are still strong   and growing, they will be more likely to hold their shares or   even increase their positions because they trust the company's   management and, today more than ever, in the fallout of financial   crisis, markets run more on trust than money. As a matter of   fact, the 2008 financial crisis and the ensuing five years of   economic turmoil clearly revealed the insufficiency of   disclosures, especially in the case of financial   institutions.More transparencyFirst of all, making more financial information available   means more transparency for its investors who can make more   appropriate and accurate investment decisions based on a larger   amount of data to evaluate and compare.Voluntary disclosure decreases the investor's information   asymmetry to the extent of its usefulness. The degree of its   usefulness depends on its relevance, reliability, timeliness, and   clarity.Moreover, the market tends to value more companies presenting   clear and easy-to-understand financial statements than those   filing complex and opaque ones.Many are the communication channels through which investor   relations can convey the company's disclosure to the financial   community. The main channels employed are the press releases,   investor and analyst meetings, earnings guidelines, investor   presentations, and the Investor Relations page on the company's   website.Investors are often concerned not with past earnings, but   rather with future ones, thus the way a company communicates that   financial information through the communication channels   mentioned above might convince or not the investors to buy its   stocks.In addition, investing in businesses which implement an   effective voluntary disclosure policy means investing into firms   managed by credible and reliable managers; in other words,   transparency leads to credibility and trust.More liquidityThe implementation of an effective disclosure policy aimed to   reduce the information asymmetries between management and   investors will entail a higher liquidity of the shares and   increase the company's visibility, thereby attracting more   analysts to cover the stock and more institutional investors to   buy the company's shares whose price will eventually go up with a   clear and obvious advantage for all the investors.A more liquid stock also means a reduced bid-offer spread (the   empirical measure of market liquidity) for the investors, which   means a cheaper cost of trading. In conclusion, an effective   disclosure policy reduces information asymmetry and increases   liquidity in the equity market.Lower debtIncreased liquidity also brings about a lower cost of capital,   thus the company will have to bear a smaller burden of debt,   which is great news for the company's investors.The majority of studies have confirmed that the cost of   capital decreases as the company's risk perception dissipates   within the market and, as a consequence, the firm will be able   not only to finance its investments at a lower cost, but also   raise equity capital more easily. Ultimately, disclosure   facilitates external financing, investments, and growth, which   will be eventually reflected in the rise of the stock price.By no surprise, the leading IT consulting firm Infosys (INFY) ranking among the three top companies for disclosure on its   domestic market (BSE100) has approximately a 5.90% weighted   average cost of capital vs. a 45.20% return on invested capital.   In other words it can generate excess returns on the investments   7.6 times more than its cost of capital. Besides that, Infosys   can sport a 10-year track record of consistent growth in sales,   profits, free cash flow and dividends.Stock price appreciation and lower volatilityFirms with high levels of disclosure have a higher association   with stock price increase than those with low levels of   information disclosure.A very interesting study published in the ""Financial Management"" journal compares an investment made in high-disclosure   companies with an investment made in low-disclosure companies,   and it shows that the high-disclosure portfolio outperforms the   low-disclosure portfolio by an average of 7% per year over a   period of 14 years.Other studies have proved that more transparent firms benefit   from a reduction in the volatility of returns which for the   investors means less risk and more stable returns over time.The increase of liquidity attracts more institutional   investors who generate more volume and therefore push the stocks'   price up. In addition, the increase of the analyst coverage and   the set up of target prices might also contribute in putting   further upwards pressure on the stocks' price.Thestatus quoof disclosure and transparency in the corporate worldIn 2014 Transparency International ((TI)), the watchdog that monitors the international corruption among   countries and corporations published a ranking of the top 10 most   transparent companies and the least transparent firms in the   world among the 124 largest publicly-listed companies based on an   index which takes into account anti-corruption programs adopted   by the ranked companies and their overall organizational   transparency. Seven of the top companies are from Europe while   eight of the bottom 10 companies are from Asia.(click to enlarge)(click to enlarge)TI also published a report whose findings are very interesting   but also surprising.In terms of sectors, telecoms and oil/gas companies lead the   way whilst consumer services, financial, tech and healthcare   firms are the least transparent. Geographically, EU companies   score highest in organizational transparency with an average of   54% and U.S. firms score the lowest at 24%.U.S. tech giants Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Google (GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and IBM (NYSE:IBM) all score less than three out of 10.Another American famous firm, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A) (BRK.B), Warren Buffett's conglomerate, also had a bad   performance, ranking among the last 10.""Tech companies are driving changes that are making our   societies more open and accountable. They should be setting an   example for other companies on transparency"" said Cobus de   Swardt, TI's managing director.The report also shows the positive impact of strong   legislation, with U.K. companies scoring 90% on average compared   to 20% in China.According to the report, financial sector companies still   should be more transparent and accountable to the public if they   want to win back public trust which is yet faltering.The report urges multinational companies to seek more   transparency by disclosing the subsidiaries through which they   operate in different countries which are often impossible to   trace. Obtaining this information through a country-by-country   report is important since it would help people understand the   impact of multinational companies in their own country. In   addition, through a full disclosure of corporate holdings,   investors can gain more knowledge of financial flows such as   intra-company transfers and payments to governments.While all the evaluated German companies disclose all their   subsidiaries abroad, no Chinese company discloses any financial   data in any of the 59 foreign countries where they operate.In the country-by-country disclosure ranking, more than 50   companies scored an embarrassing 0% and only three performed   above the 50% level, the pre-tax profits being the least   disclosed financial information while the revenues being the most   disclosed. Amazon, Apple, Google and IBM all fail to publish a   full list of countries in which their subsidiaries operate.The watchdog in its report also highlights the importance for   the investors to be aware of the anti-corruption policies   established by the companies they want to invest in since this   information will help them evaluate better the risk associated   with the investment. U.K. companies perform best on   anti-corruption whilst Chinese and Japanese companies are the   poorest performers in both dimensions.In conclusion, investing in companies with a high rate of   discretionary disclosure and transparency can dramatically   increase the overall shareholders' value and substantially reduce   the risk associated with the investment.See alsoThe iShares MSCI Malaysia ETF Is A Speculative Buyon seekingalpha.com"

Could Apple Inc. (AAPL) Be The First Ever $1 Trillion Company?;2/22/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsI stumbled across a prediction last week that would impress even Mad Money's Jim Cramer.makeArticleAd();According to a recent report from Oxfam, an international charitable organization, Bill Gates has a shot at becoming the world's first trillionaire. Oxfam speculates that if the returns on the tech mogul's $75 billion fortune in the next 25 years are similar to those in the last 25 years, Gates has a shot at jumping the $1 trillion mark.That got me thinking, if one man has a shot at becoming a trillionaire, certainly one of theS&P 500′s biggest companies has a shot at becoming the world's first $1 trillion company?Turns out, a few do.I see five S&P 500 companies with a shot at breaking the $1 trillion mark in the next five years.-Facebook Inc(FB) is the smallest company on the list with a market cap of $386 billion. Facebook's share price would need to hit $345, up 159%.-Amazon.com, Inc.(AMZN) has a market cap of $400 billion. Shares would need to hit $1,980, up 125%.-Microsoft Corporation(MSFT) has a market cap of $498 billion. Shares would need to hit $130, up 100%.-Alphabet Inc(GOOG) is currently worth $570 billion. Shares would need to hit $1,431, up 70%.I believe every one of these companies will eventually be worth $1 trillion. However, one other company will beat them all to it.Thanks to a variety of factors,Apple Inc.(AAPL) is set to become the first $1 trillion company in the world in the next five years.The company has been on a roll. After beating fourth-quarter earnings by 4%, shares just hit a new all-time high above $135.That gives Apple a market cap of $710 billion, making it the largest company in the S&P 500. It has also placed Apple within striking distance of the $1 trillion mark. Shares of Apple would only need to climb 50% to $200 to give it a market cap of $1 trillion.7 Tech Stocks With Explosive Growth PotentialThat is well within reach.If its current valuation stayed the same, Apple would need to grow earnings by 8% annually in the next five years to hit that target. As it stands, Apple is expected to grow earnings by 8% this year and another 13% in 2018. Those two years alone get Apple almost half way to 50% earnings growth.But even if Apple's earnings grow slower than expected, it has an ace up its sleeve.Apple Has $246 Billion In Cash On Its Balance SheetApple's cash position is larger than the GDP of most countries. In recent fourth-quarter results, Apple's reported a cash position of $246 billion. Some of that cash is already accounted for in Apple's $700 billion valuation. But not all of it.Using as little as half of its cash balance to repurchase shares adds another $125 billion to Apple's market cap.Apple's Is One Of The Most Undervalued Stocks In The S&P 500Apple is one of the most undervalued stocks in the S&P 500. Its forward P/E ratio of 15 is a discount to the S&P 500s 20. That lower valuation exists despite the fact that Apple is projected to grow earnings faster than the S&P 500 in the next five years.Technically speaking that means Apple should be trading with a higher P/E ratio than the S&P 500. If Apple traded with the same P/E ratio as the S&P 500, shares would shares would climb 25%, giving Apple a market cap of $887 billion.Warren Buffett Just Made A Huge Investment In AppleApple's pursuit of the $1 trillion threshold has attracted the attention of the world's greatest investor. In recent regulatory filings, Berkshire revealed it had quadrupled its ownership in Apple to 57 million shares. Buffett's stake was worth approximately $6.6 billion at the end of 2016.With shares of Apple already up 17% on the year, Buffett has pocketed a quick $1.1 billion gain in less than six weeks.7 Dividend Stocks for the Retirement You DeserveRisks To Consider:Apple has struggled to launch new hits in the last few years. Although sales growth in its most important product the iPhone is still strong, Apple isn't the innovative company it was under Steve Jobs.Action To Take:Apple is on pace to become the world's first $1 trillion company. Even though shares are trading at an all-time high, I see plenty of growth and gains ahead. Buy shares anywhere below the all-time high and hold until Apple becomes the first $1 trillion company in the world.Editor's Note:Tech companieshave a history of turning stockholders, secretaries and even janitors into ""overnight"" millionaires.In 2017, innovations in virtual reality will do the same for owners of these 2 stocks…StreetAuthority's mission is to help individual investors earn above-average profits by providing a source of independent, unbiased - and most of all, profitable - investing ideas.

Is GoPro Inc. Stock a Buy After Its Earnings Sell-Off?;2/22/2017;"It's been a rough past few years forGoPro(NASDAQ: GPRO) stock. Surging to prominence in the   post-recession, venture-capital-fueled ""age of the unicorn,""   GoPro and its innovative action cameras initially drew   comparisons to a youngApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) , the poster child a for successful   hardware-driven electronics business.That comparison has turned out to be optimistic, to say the   least, and GoPro shares have marched downward in the roughly two   years since its stock price bubble burst.makeArticleAd();GPROdata byYChartsAfter GoPro engaged in some painful restructuring in 2016, its   earnings report earlier this month offered investors a glimpse   into what it sees around the bend for its business. Investors   responded by sending its shares southbound.But how low is too low? With its shares in the tank, let's see   whether GoPro is finally cheap enough to deserve investors'   interest.GoPro earnings: What we learnedJust about everything that could go wrong for GoPro did in   2016. During its Q3 conference call, the company alerted   investors to the production problems that affected the company's   then-forthcoming HERO5 Black action camera. The Q3 spillover   effect from its production issues hampered GoPro's ability to   supply enough HERO5 Black devices to some of its key retail   partners. These retailers, in turn, pulled promotional   support for the HERO5 Black, which caused the company to capture   less holiday season demand than it had anticipated.Image source: GoProCompounding its problems, GoPro encountered issues with the   launch of its much-touted Karma drone, as problems with the latch   that held its battery in place caused the Karma to lose power in   midair. GoPro halted production of the Karma until a redesigned   latch could be introduced, and that setback also led to   underwhelming Karma sales during the fourth quarter.The quarter wasn't without some positives, though. For the   quarter, sales rose 24% to $540.6 million, the second largest   revenue total for a quarter in GoPro's 14 years in operation. The   company also enacted a major cost restructuring, including   killing its GoPro Entertainment division and eliminating 200   full-time employees -- efforts that the company expects will   reduce its operating cost structure by $100 million annually to   an annual run rate below $600 million.In the year ahead, GoPro plans to focus its efforts on a small   handful of initiatives, including increasing its emphasis on its   image-editing software, Quik; expanding its brand reach by   creating new ways to engage its user base; growing   internationally; and continuing to create compelling hardware.   All of this sounds encouraging, in theory. However, I'm still not   sold that the company's new strategic vision and increasing focus   on execution are enough to create a sustainably profitable   business.Still skepticalGoPro's strategy makes perfect sense. Creating new types of   devices, like the Karma, and attempting to create an end-to-end   software and hardware ecosystem should help expand the breadth   and depth of its business footprint. This strategy mirrors the   closed ecosystem that Apple has employed to such spectacular   results since the launch of the iPod. However, GoPro's devices   differ from Apple's in a few important ways that reduce the   strength of GoPro's business model in comparison.Image source: GoPro.The first is the size of its addressable market. For the   iPhone, Apple enjoys a potential addressable market of all   smartphone users -- which means billions of potential customers,   compared with the several million users who buy GoPro each year.   Moreover, the smartphone's place as the Swiss Army knife of our   digital lives makes it an essential tool for many consumers,   compared with the more recreational nature of GoPro's products.   Finally, Apple's closed app ecosystem provides a far richer set   of user experiences than GoPro'sThe point here isn't just to compare and contrast Apple and   GoPro. Rather, we're looking at the ways in which a consumer   hardware business model needs to differentiate itself to produce   meaningful profit. When it comes to the size of its market, the   importance of its product to its users, and the stickiness of its   software, GoPro falls well short of Apple's template for   success.The analyst figures further bear this out. Wall Street's   estimates see GoPro generating single-digit sales growth and   continued net losses both this year and next. So while GoPro is   indeed employing a sensible strategy to improve its prospects,   investing in shares of the action-camera pioneer still seems like   a risky proposition.10 stocks we like better than GoProWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Garmin (GRMN)'s Remarkable Turnaround;2/22/2017;"Corporate turnarounds are a wonderful thing to behold, but are quite rare, particularly in certain industries. Consumer electronics, for example, is a business dominated by trends with phenomenal growth possible when something catches on. The flip side of that, however, is that when a brand loses its luster, the decline is usually as rapid as the rise. That is what makes the turnaround achieved at Garmin (GRMN) so remarkable.As the below 5 year chart for the stock ably demonstrates, from mid-2013 on GRMN was all the rage for a year or so. The company’s GPS navigation systems had dealt with some serious competition from other hand held devices and reached the point that manufacturers dream of, where their brand name becomes synonymous with the product.The thing that people attached to their dashboard to give directions was, to a large percentage of the population, a Garmin, regardless of the actual brand of the device.makeArticleAd();The stock reacted accordingly, almost doubling in a year. The peak came at the end of June 2014, and then just eighteen months later, at the end of 2015, GRMN was back around the $33 mark from which the rise began. At that time forecasts of the company’s demise were commonplace, if a little premature.As Apple maps gained ground and built in navigation systems became standard in many cars, dashboard GPS devices began to seem anachronistic. Throughout 2015, Garmin posted negative year on year growth in both revenue and earnings and the stock was written off by many.Cliff Pemble, the CEO of the company since 2013, however, had other ideas. He took a gamble and promoted a focus on wearable technology. At the time that was not seen as a smart move by many people. After all, it meant taking on not just established companies in that area such as Fitbit (FIT), but also Apple (AAPL), who were moving into the watch business. If today’s release of Q4 2016 earnings is any guide, though, that opinion could not have been more wrong.Garmin reported big beats on revenue ($860.8 million vs. $800 million estimated) and Earnings per Share (73 cents vs. 58 cents estimated). Even more significantly in many ways, they also boosted their revenue outlook for 2017 to above current Wall Street estimates, and said that it was growth in the wearables area that was in large part driving the performance.GRMN had already gained around twenty three percent over the past year, but jumped another nine percent or so in early trading this morning as a result of those numbers.It could be argued that as a result of that, any value that there may have been in the stock is now gone. A quick glance at the usual valuation metrics would support that view, but the long term case for GRMN is a little more subtle. As I said earlier, turnarounds of this magnitude are rare anywhere, but especially so in consumer electronics. The fact that Pemble was able to engineer this one, though, is a very good reason to own the stock.Recognizing the fact that the market was changing and making changes to adjust for those changes took a lot of guts, but also demanded skilled execution. That combination of being prepared to take calculated risks and having the skill to execute a turnaround effectively is exactly what investors should look for in a CEO, and the knowledge that at Garmin there is a management team that fits that bill is enough to make GRMN a good long term investment."

3 Warren Buffett Dividend Stocks to Buy;2/22/2017;"Warren Buffett ownsApple Inc.(NASDAQ: AAPL) ,Delta Air Lines(NYSE: DAL) , andWells Fargo(NYSE: WFC)  stock because they're great companies that he   was able to buy at a fair price. But there's another reason why   investors might want to follow in his footsteps and add these   stocks to their portfolios: all three have a solid history of   dividend increases.Back on topWarren Buffett said it was his lieutenants that were initially   responsible for adding Apple toBerkshire Hathaway's(NYSE: BRK-A) (NYSE: BRK-B) portfolio, but given Apple has   become Berkshire Hathaway's sixth biggest stock, it seems the   Oracle of Omaha has also given Apple his blessing.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();Berkshire Hathaway bought Apple shares when they were on the   down-and-out because existing iPhone users were holding off on   upgrades. Since then, Apple's shares have climbed on optimism   that sales would pick up in the wake of competitor stumbles and   new product launches.Last quarter, that optimism was rewarded with record iPhone,   Mac, Apple Watch, and services sales. Record results in the   company's services segment was especially good news because it's   high-margin revenue that can help support profit and future   dividend increases. Last quarter, services revenue grew 13%   quarter-over-quarter and 18% year-over-year to $7.2   billion. The strong results produced operating cash flow of   $27 billion last year, and as a result, the company returned   nearly $15 billion to investors via share buybacks and dividend   payments.Thanks to a 10% dividend increase last April, the company's   dividend per share is currently $0.57 per quarter, which is 21%   higher than it was in 2014. If sales continue to grow, investors   could get rewarded with another dividend increase soon, and   if Donald Trump makes good on promises to allow companies   like Apple to repatriate cash held overseas, then the company   could have even greater dividend flexibility.Admittedly, Apple's 1.7% dividend yield isn't the biggest   yield out there, but this is a top-tier company with a rock-solid   balance sheet, and given the potential to consistently boost its   dividend over time, I think it's a stock that's worthy of owning   in income portfolios.AAPL Dividenddata byYCharts.Flying highWarren Buffett is making a 60 million share, $3 billion bet   that Delta Air Lines' future is brighter than its past. His stake   is particularly significant because it suggests Buffett   believes there's been a fundamental change in an industry that he   once labeled as a ""terrible"" industry for investors.Perhaps Buffett's change of heart is due to an industry wide   shift in how airlines approach their business. In the past,   airlines increased the number of routes they offered and competed   fiercely on price. Today, they focus on fewer routes and fuller   flights, rather than price wars.This approach has helped airlines deliver more consistent   profit, and with the U.S. economy expanding, that could be good   news for future dividend increases. Last year, Delta Air Lines'   revenue passenger miles were up 1.7%, and with economists   predicting GDP and personal income growth in 2017, there's   reason to think that passenger miles will climb again this   year.If so, then Delta Air Lines may have plenty of financial   flexibility to return more money to investors. In 2016,   its operating cash flow was $7 billion and its net income   was $4 billion, and that allowed the company to spend $3.1   billion on share buybacks and dividends. The company increased   its quarterly dividend payment 50% last year, and at $0.203 per   share, its dividend is significantly higher than the $0.063 per   share it paid investors in 2014.Rising rates, bigger profitsWells Fargo is Berkshire Hathaway's second biggest position,   and although Wells Fargo's shares tumbled last year on news that   marketing incentives caused workers tocreate""fake"" accounts, shares have recovered their losses and are   trading near 52-week highs.Wells Fargo's rebound has a lot to do with the Fed's   increasingly hawkish approach to interest rates.Over the past few years, the spread between bank lending rates   and borrowing costs has been hamstrung by rock-bottom fed funds   rates and government bond buying programs that have depressed   Treasury yields. Recently, the Fed has been threatening   higher rates to curb inflation risks, and in December, it bumped   up rates by 25 basis points. Industry watchers think another 25   basis point increase could be coming soon.If so, then it would be good news for Wells Fargo. The   company's interest rate sensitivity forecast suggests   it could enjoy up to a 5% earnings tailwind over the next   two years, if interest rates climb more quickly than it's   modeling.If rising rates boost profit, then it could help Wells   Fargo convince regulators to OK a dividend increase. Currently,   Wells Fargo is paying shareholders $0.38 per share per quarter   dividend, up from $0.225 cents per share in 2012. The bank could   also get additional wiggle room on its dividend depending on   how regulatory reform in Washington pans out. Currently,   Wells Fargo has to get a green light from regulators before   returning money to investors, but that could conceivably change   under Donald Trump.10 stocks we like better than Wells FargoWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Intel Corporation's 5G Apple Inc. iPhone Opportunity;2/22/2017;"Microprocessor giantIntel(NASDAQ: INTC) surprised many when it was revealed that it had   won a significant portion of the cellular modem orders forApple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) iPhone 7 series smartphones.The company's public commentary suggests that this isn't just   a proverbial flash in the pan, either -- Intel seems to have theiPhone 8(or whatever Apple calls the follow-on devices to this year's   iPhone 7 series) as well as thefollow-on to thatin the bag.Image source: Apple.makeArticleAd();In this article, I'd like to go over why I think there's an   opportunity for Intel to gain dollar content share at Apple with   the 2018 iPhone.The shift to 5GBoth Intel and wireless chip giantQualcommboth intend to sample 5G modems in 2017 with commercial   shipments beginning in 2018.To my knowledge, both companies' 5G modem solutions will   require separate 4G LTE modems (either as discrete parts or   integrated in the smartphone applications processor) for phones   implementing the 5G solution to work on today's 4G networks.Apple was late to adopt LTE relative to some of its peers in   the smartphone market, but given that Apple has ""grown up"" quite   a bit from a technical perspective (substantially higher research   and development budget) and the industry has gottenmuchmore competitive (forcing Apple to try to adopt cutting-edge   technology for its devices), it may be one of the first to deploy   5G modems.Intel's opportunityShould Apple choose to adopt 5G functionality in its 2018   iPhone models, this could be a solid win for Intel's cellular   modem business.Indeed, if Intel goes from selling a single LTE baseband (and   associated components) to selling both an LTE baseband as well as   a 5G modem (and any additional components), then it makes sense   that the chipmaker's dollar content per iPhone could   increase.Given that Intel's only significant exposure to the large   smartphone chip market is via the sale of cellular modems to   Apple, a big boost in dollar content at Apple should mean a big   boost in the revenue -- and ultimately profits -- that Intel can   harvest from the smartphone market.A big step for Intel's modem business, a small step for Intel   in totalIntel is an extremely large company, generating nearly $60   billion in revenue during 2016. Intel's revenue run rate from   sales of modems to Apple is likely in the ballpark of $1 billion   per year (assume $10 per modem, 100 million iPhone units with   Intel modems sold per year).If Intel were to see its dollar content rise by 50%, then   roughly $1 billion in annual sales becomes $1.5 billion; a   doubling of dollar content would mean that $1 billion in annual   sales goes up to $2 billion.Of course, Intel is already investing significantly to develop   these cellular modems, so the more revenue that the company can   wring out of those investments, the better. However, any   potential revenue growth from additional dollar content in a   future iPhone isn't going to be a game changer for Intel   stock.To put things into perspective, though, few things have the   potential to move the needle for Intel stock -- what the company   needs to do (and has been doing) is looking to capitalize on as   many reasonably sized opportunities as possible in the hopes   that, in aggregate, they add up to enough additional revenue to   deliver revenue growth even as its largest business (personal   computer processors) declines.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

3 Reasons Why Apple Isn't Buying Netflix;2/22/2017;"We'll never hear the end of the buyout buzz when it comes toNetflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) . As long as it remains the top dog in premium   video streaming and the niche is still booming there will always   be chatter about how good Netflix would look on the arm of a tech   or media giant.Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is a potential buyer that comes up every so often,   and it did so again in aCNBC articlelast night. Anita Balakrishnan's piece argues that the   ""best argument"" for Apple buying Netflix is that App Store   spending on entertainment programs is soaring, and the consumer   tech giant may as well nab the top dog to beef up its growing   services revenue.Don't wait up for a wedding invitation.makeArticleAd();A Motley Fool social media poll -- gauging investor opinions   on a potential deal between Apple and Netflix -- has ""No Chance""   as the runaway answer with 48% of the votes among four choices as   of last night.Will Apple buy Netflix in 2017?- The Motley Fool (@themotleyfool)February 22, 2017Let's go over a few of the reasons why Apple buying Netflix   doesn't make a lot of sense.Apple buying Netflix? I've seenStranger Things. Image source: Netflix.1. Apple isn't going to play favoritesThe CNBC article leans ondata from Sensor Tower, showing that the App Store's Entertainment category saw   spending soar 130% over the past year. Netflix's chunk of that   business is growing even faster, going from $7.9 million in gross   revenue during the fourth quarter of 2015 to more than $58   million a year later. Netflix began monetizing subscriptions   through Apple's app marketplace during the fourth quarter of   2015.The growth may seem impressive, but what will Apple be   telegraphing if it snaps up Netflix? Developers turn to mobile   marketplaces because of the level playing field. Fellow video   apps may not feel that the playing field is very level with the   top dog in Apple's arsenal.Apple has homegrown apps in streaming entertainment. However,   Apple Music is not the niche leader. Yes, it did buy Beats Music,   but mostly for its headphones business. Apple buying Netflix   could shift development by other platforms away from iOS.2. Netflix may not move the needle at AppleApple has a ton of dough on its books. There is more than $246   billion in cash and marketable securities on its balance sheet,   and between a president that may relax repatriation rules and a   tech behemoth hungry for growth it may only be a matter of time   before Apple goes on a shopping spree.A purchase of Apple may seem to help with growth on the   surface. Apple's revenue declined 7.7% in fiscal 2016, unlike   Netflix which saw its top line soar by 30.2% last year. However,   Netflix going from $6.8 billion to $8.8 billion last year would   only be a drop in the bucket at Apple which went from $233.7   billion to $215.6 billion. The combined company would have seen   its revenue decline 6.7% to $224.4 billion.An argument could be made that Apple could use Netflix as a   tool to drive hardware sales by making the service or some parts   of the platform exclusive to iOS and MacOS, but that would also   likely shave the total revenue at Netflix.3. It's going to take a fat premium to nab NetflixThere are a couple of tech, cable, and media companies that   could take advantage of Netflix's competitive position, and the   purchase would be dilutive in all cases. However, it would   probably be a lot more dilutive to the buyer than it appears at   current market prices.There's no reason for Netflix to settle for a modest buyout   premium. This is a stock that was the S&P 500's biggest   gainer in 2013 and 2015, more than doubling each year. It's up   another 15% less than a sixth of the way through 2017. How much   would you accept to punch out?Netflix is a great company in a great place, but it's also a   hot stock -- and that's not the kind of situation where   shareholders will go along with a 20% to 30% premium. Apple is   one of the few companies with that kind of dough in its arsenal,   but you just know that Netflix will not come cheap. With a likely   drawn-out regulatory approval process if a deal were to be   announced, Netflix would be right to command a lot of money to be   waiting in the wings while its stock has been one of the hottest   stocks over the past four years. Apple and Netflix make sense,   but it's just not going to happen.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Boeing Co: 2 Tailwinds That Could Propel BA Stock;2/22/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTo put it in pilot parlance,Boeing Co(NYSE:BA) has nudged the throttle forward to pick up speed en route to a higher altitude. Specifically, the aircraft maker recently doubled manufacturing capacity for its increasingly popular 737 passenger jet at its Renton, Washington plant.makeArticleAd();Source:WikimediaAt first glance it could be concerning to current or would-be owners of BA stock. Not only did President Trumptake aim at Boeingover the cost of the next version of Air Force One, he's effectively put all defense contractors on notice that overpriced wares won't be tolerated.Lockheed Martin Corporation(NYSE:LMT) was recently forced to make price concessions on its F-35 fighter jet program. Last week, Boeingdodged a bulletwhen workers in South Carolina voted against union representation, ending a bitter battle.CEO Dennis Muilenburg told a Cowen and Co. conference earlier this month that itwasn't selling enough777 and 787 jets, adding to the challenges ahead for Boeing stock. Investors may be wondering if it can sell enough of everything else to offset any weakness from those two planes.If recent orders are any indication, the answer is a strong ""probably."" BA stock holders may want to look at a couple of other recent developments which bode very well for the company. They show that Boeing is going to need that new capacity.Two Tailwinds BlowingEarlier this monthSingapore Airlines (ADR)(OTCMKTS:SINGY)placed an orderfor 20 777's and 19 787's, worth a total of $13.8 billion. No single order - no matter how big or small - can make or break the company, but it's an encouraging answer to Muilenburg's worry that Boeing isn't selling enough of those particular planes.The 10 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold ForeverThe kicker: It may have been a bit hyperbolic, though StrategicAero Research chief analystSaj Ahmad commentedfollowing news of the Singapore Airlines order:""It almost certainly signals the death-knell for the aging and less fuel efficient A380 fleet. There doesn't seem to be appetite to buy more and add yet more capacity into its network when the entire (Asia-Pacific) region is battling to make money and generate better yields, despite cabins being fuller as a result of cheaper air fares.""If Airbus does indeed close the books on the A380, it creates an opportunity Boeing in that category.At the same time, just a month after President Trump gave Boeing some rough treatment, he threw the company a tentative bone. Reversing a stance he voiced on the campaign trail, Trump isnow semi-supportiveof the United States Export-Import bank.The bank essentially facilitates international trade of aircraft and other goods by offering loans to buyers and loan guarantees to Boeing's overseas customers. Trump had threatened to shutter the service but now seems to be willing to back it. Those loans would support BA, including its move toset up a shopin India as the foundation for growth in the region.Bottom Line for BA StockThis week, Buckingham Research was chastised for a strange downgrade. While itupped its target priceto $140 from $100, it downgraded BA stock to ""Underperform."" Even more troubling to investors is that BA shares are now priced above $160.Freeport-McMoRan Inc. Is Too Dangerous Right NowBeneath the surface, though, Buckingham's thinking and action does make sense, and prospective BA stock buyers may be best served by waiting for a pullback.While the stars may be aligning for the company, Boeing stock has rallied a hefty 26% over the course of the past six months, pushing its trailing P/E to a frothy 22.1. Although the future may look brighter, that's still a tough earnings multiple to justify based on the next few months. As Buckingham voiced it, BA stock is ""priced to perfection.""As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceThe 10 Best Oil Stocks to Buy Now for Big-Time Gains10 High-Yield Dividend Stocks That Are SOMEHOW Still BargainsIs Apple Inc.

Here’s Where Two Vocal Bulls Think Stocks Are Heading;2/22/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsU.S. equities are on a surprising rally and the voice of reason suggests that the current market rally has gone on quite far too fast.makeArticleAd();However, investors have fewer reasons to believe in the prophets of doom because the rally is still going on strong. Two top Wall Street analysts have lent their voice to the bullish sentiments.This article seeks to explore where equities are actually headed amidst the din of unending stream of analysis from different commentators on the wisdom/foolishness of chasing the rally.Why are Investors Worried About Equities?If we were to go by the voice of 'reason' U.S. stocks should have been struggling to stay afloat since Donald Trump won a surprise victory during the 2016 election. Prior to the election, Wall Street had largely been worried about the potential implications of a Trump presidency for the stock market.Analysts were worried that a Trump presidency could lead to an unprecedented level of uncertainty in the global market.Interestingly, Trumpwon the electionand stocks have been on a massive rally ever since. The chart below shows how stocks have fared since Trump won the election last year until Wednesday February 15.The performance of U.S. equities was particularly bullish on Wednesday February 15. TheS&P 500marked 87 consecutive sessions through which it didn't record a 1% decline - the index has booked a decent gain of 9.80% since Trump's victory.7 Dividend Stocks for the Retirement You DeserveTheDow Jones Industrial Averageis up 12.43% since Trump's victory and it has crossed the elusive 20,000 mark. The tech-heavyNASDAQ Compositehas gained 12.05% since Trump's victory despite the fact that Trump has had some spats with some tech firms such asApple Inc.(AAPL) andAmazon.com, Inc.(AMZN) during his campaign. The uptrend in the NASDAQ marks the seventh straight session of gains in the index.From the foregoing, market bears have legitimately strong reasons to be worried about the fate of the market. The fact that stocks are rising when Wall Street analysts had largely expected it to fall is enough reason to be worried that the rally is too good to be true.In fact, someLionexo binary optionstraders have started calling the current rally the ""Icarus Rally"" because it is resplendent of a Greek mythlogy in which Icarus flew started flying higher and higher on a wing of wax until he flew too close to the sun. Of course, his wax wings melted and he crashed to his death - if the Icarus trade is true for equities, stocks might eventually have a sharp and rapid correction into bear territory.These Two Wall Street Analysts Think Stocks Have a Way to Go…For NowThe first vocal analysts making strong argumentsin support of the current rallyin the market is Binky Chadha, chief global strategist atDeutsche Bank. He submits that stocks are actually soaring because Trump's vocal nature provides a strong direction about the intents and plans of the current administration. He believes that the fact that Trump's words can help you know what he is planning per time removes much of the fears of uncertainties that Wall Street had forecasted under his government.Of course, one can make strong arguments on both sides of the debate about whether Trump's policies are good or bad.Nonetheless, the fact that he says what is on his mind eliminates uncertainty and you can then make informed trading and decisions in response to the government's plans and actions. Binky Chadha believes that the S&P 500 still has more room to soar. He expects the S&P 500 to reach 2600 by the end of year to mark 11% upside from the current price.Michael Hartnett, chief investment strategist atBank of America Merrill Lynchis also vocal in his support for the bullish rally. He believes that U.S. equities still have more room to soar before the inevitable correction eventually begins. Hartnett's bullish stance is hinged on the thesis the current rally in stocks is already a self-fulfilling prophecy because the rally is attracting new investors and the inflow of funds from new investors is further fuelling the bullish sentiments in the market.7 Tech Stocks With Explosive Growth PotentialHartnett submits that U.S. indexes could record another 6% in gains as investors continue to pile into the market in order to book gains. In his words, ""measuring fear is easier than measuring greed"" and greed will continue to drive the rally until the rally becomes unsustainable. He submits that the rally willend in a sharp reversal- when massive profit taking starts or when earnings fail to live up to expectations.The postHere's Where Two Vocal Bulls Think Stocks Are Headingappeared first onValueWalk.Many academics claim investing is a ""random walk.""

Is Apple Stock a Buy Ahead of iPhone 8?;2/21/2017;"Apple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) upcoming iPhone 8 is looking as if it could   represent a total overhaul to the current iPhone design. Recent   rumors suggest that the upcoming flagship version of the iPhone   could have an edge-to-edge OLED 5.8-inch display, integration of   Touch ID into the display, the elimination the home button, 3D   facial-recognition capabilities, wireless charging, and a cost   upwards of $1,000. A major overhaul like this could easily   solicit a monster upgrade cycle, akin to huge growth in iPhone   sales sparked by the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus launch several years   ago.With such a significant update possibly around the corner, is   now a good time to buyApple stock? Or should investors stay on the sidelines until speculation is   replaced by facts?Image source: ApplemakeArticleAd();I'd argue that Apple stock is a buy ahead of the iPhone 8   launch. But it's not necessarily because the iPhone 8 might   represent the first significant redesign to the iPhone in three   years. It's because Apple's underlying iPhone business already   has some concrete trends working in its favor, whether the next   iPhone gets a radical revamp or not.Even with an outdated form factor, the iPhone is     growingApple's 2016 flagship iPhone launch broke from the company's   usual practice of redesigning the smartphone's form factor every   other year. The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus sported the same general   design as 2015's iPhone 6s and 6s Plus and even 2014's iPhone 6   and 6 Plus. Nevertheless, iPhone sales hit a record high in the   company's most recent quarter. In Apple's first fiscal quarter of   2017, iPhone revenue and units were up 5% year over year.This bodes well for the strength of Apple's iPhone business.   If Apple can continue growing iPhone units and revenue in its   important holiday quarter with a three-year-old form factor,   Apple's iPhone business may be better off than investors   realize.Apple's pricing power is as strong as everA testament to Apple's clout with its customer base, customers   are paying more for iPhone than ever before. Apple has   continually offered higher-priced options for customers by   rolling out Plus versions of its flagship device with the iPhone   6 and 6 Plus, offering higher storage tiers, and simply byincreasing the price of its iPhones. And customers don't seem to mind. In Apple's most recent   quarter, the iPhone's average selling price hit an all-time high   of $695, up from $691 in the year-ago quarter, and up   significantly from $637 three years ago.This incredible pricing power vouches for the premium price   Apple customers remain willing to pay for an iPhone.iPhone owners are extremely satisfiedApple has always put customer satisfaction at the top of its   priorities. And it continues to pay off for the company. Citing   the latest data from 451 Research, Apple CFO Luca Maestri noted   in the company's most recent earnings call that iPhone owners had   a 97% overall satisfaction rate in the U.S., with 99%   satisfaction for owners of the iPhone 7 Plus.With satisfaction like this, it's unlikely that iPhone buyers   will be switching to another brand.Image source: AppleMore consumers are upgrading and switching to iPhone     than everCustomers appear as willing as ever to buy an iPhone. Apple's   absolute number of iPhone upgraders and the number of buyers   switching from another smartphone were both at an all-time high   in the company's most recent quarter, CEO Tim Cook said in   Apple's first-quarter earnings call.Put all of this against the back drop of Apple's conservative   price-to-earnings ratio of just 16.4 and a healthy iPhone segment   alone looks like a reason to bet on Apple stock. A major redesign   to the iPhone, with potential to spark a monster upgrade cycle,   could just be icing on the cake.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Why Investors Should Be Optimistic About Apple's China Rebound;2/21/2017;"Last year was rough onApple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) business in China for a few reasons. The ongoing   strength in the U.S. dollar continued to weigh on results, which   also affected Apple's performance in Hong Kong (which is included   in Apple's Greater China segment), since the Hong Kong dollar has   been pegged to the U.S. dollar for over three decades. In terms   of investor sentiment, 2015 was so strong that Apple faced tough   comparisons throughout 2016.But the Mac maker is mounting a rebound in the Middle Kingdom.   On the last call, CFO Luca Maestri noted that mainland China   revenue was ""even with the all-time record results from a year   ago, and grew in constant currency terms."" Local rivals Oppo and   Vivo, which are both owned by BBK Electronics, enjoyed aprecipitous riselast year as Apple fell to the No. 5 spot in China. Despite   intense competition from low-cost rivals, investors have reason   to be optimistic about Apple's rebound.Word on the StreetMorgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty put out a research note   (viaTech Trader Daily) earlier today, in which she believes that Apple will be able to   win over switchers from Oppo and Vivo. Huberty estimates that 20%   of smartphone users that are currently using Chinese brands will   switch to the iPhone the next time they upgrade. With   expectations running high for this year's 10th-generation iPhone,   combined with Chinese consumers' sensitivity to form factor   changes, Apple could enjoy extremely high upgrade and switcher   rates.makeArticleAd();iPhone 7 Plus. Image source: Apple.Huberty's surveys show that 24% of current Oppo users and 28%   of current Vivo users are already planning on switching to the   iPhone. Including surveys that cover other local brands and an   assumption of a two-year upgrade cycle, she believes that upwards   of 127 million non-Apple smartphone users in China will be   looking to upgrade or switch for this iPhone cycle. Meanwhile,   Apple enjoys much higher loyalty among its users -- 74% of   surveyed customers are sticking with Apple -- a commonly cited   competitive advantage.Brand loyalty is hard to come by in ChinaWhile Apple's high customer retention rates aren't news, they   are more impressive when you consider the context. Chinese   consumers have historically been notorious for extremely low   brand loyalty rates, although this has started to improve more   recently.For instance, McKinsey noted in 2010 that while Chinese   consumers are brand conscious, that doesn't really translate into   loyalty. Kantar observed something similar in 2012. In the years   since, there has been a growing subset of consumers that are   ""becoming loyal to single brands,"" McKinsey said in 2016. Here's   McKinsey principal Fang Gong in April of last year:A couple years ago, when we talked to our clients in the     consumer and retail industries, we heard a lot of complaints     about the low loyalty level of Chinese consumers. Today, based     on the reports, we cannot say that it's completely changed, but     we can say that the loyalty level of Chinese consumers has been     improving. Probably not to a single brand, but to a short list     of brands that are in the consumer's consideration set -- and     not only in their daily consumption category, such as food or     apparel, but also in big items, such as automotive.This is most prevalent for premium brands, and Apple certainly   qualifies as a premium brand. Throughout most of the developed   world, Apple enjoys this same dynamic: capturing consumers from   rival brands and retaining them much better, resulting in a slow   but steady increase in its installed base.

"How to Invest in the ""Internet of Things""";2/21/2017;"All around us, the world grows more intertwined every day. Thanks in part to our global web connections, we have the ability to interact with people and things on an incredible level. This online experience can be life-saving and important, or it can be as arbitrary as simplifying monotonous tasks.There are many industries and companies that aim to advance this experience. One growing market, known as the Internet of Things (IoT), connects our household or commercial items to a wireless network by embedding them with electronic, software, or sensor technology. This network of devices allows us to take the next step into a wireless world that relies less and less on direct human-to-computer interaction.You might actually be using products in the IoT without knowing it. Some common examples include the remote operation of a house's security system, wearable motion and activity tacking products, and even public trash bins that automatically alert a municipality when it is full.The Internet of Things is definitely present in our everyday lives right now, but it also has a lot more room to grow. According to research firm IDC, via theWall Street Journal, the IoT market could nearly triple in the coming years. In 2014, the global IoT market was worth $655.8 billion, but it could reach up to $1.7 trillion by the year 2020.With the industry showing that much room for growth, investors need to start thinking about investing in the IoT now, and we've highlighted a few companies and strategies for those who would like get the IoT into their portfolios.ETF SuccessPerhaps the easiest way for investors to make a play on the Internet of Things is with a themed ETF. If that interests you, check out Global X Internet of Things Thematic ETFSNSR, the first IoT-related ETF on the market.Big Name Patent HoldersOne of the most important steps a company needs to take to capitalize on emerging technology is locking down patents at the earliest possible point. In regards to the Internet of Things market, we've seen a lot of companies filing for patents that put them in a good position to grow as the IoT grows.One such company is technology behemoth AppleAAPL. Apple holds a patent named ""Local Device Awareness"", which describes an automated relationship between multiple close-range devices. The technology could be used for position tracking, such as finding a lost remote control, or even proximity-based virtual reality, like a video game that depends on one's actual position in a room.Another major IoT patent holder is IBMIBM. Primarily an information technology-focused company, IBM figures to be a major player in the IoT. Currently, IBM holds a patent regarding data filtering in Internet of Things devices, which describes a process in which devices receive and interpret information. This patent puts IBM amongst the frontrunners in technology that allows devices to communicate without human interaction.Furthermore, IBM just announced an Internet of Things partnership with Cisco SystemsCSCO. IBM will implement its Watson technology into Cisco's wide network of edge devices and end points in an effort to provide real-time feedback and data for the oil & gas, manufacturing, shipping, and mining industries.Today's Leading ProductsWhile patents are important for future growth and development, we also have to look at the already-available IoT devices. Again, we are looking at some of the world's biggest tech companies here.One of the more obvious industry leaders is Alphabet Inc.GOOGLand its line of Nest home monitoring products. Alphabet, under the Google name at the time, acquired Nest for $3.2 billion in early 2014, and since then the brand has become one of the biggest names in home automation with its smart thermostats, smoke detectors, and safety cameras.Another leader in the IoT market right now is AmazonAMZN. Amazon's Dash Buttons, which allow users to re-order specific products with the click of an actual physical button that can be placed anywhere in the home, could be considered an entry-level IoT device. Additionally, the company's Echo smart speakers, which utilize its Alexa home connectivity technology, are probably the most popular consumer IoT product on the market right nowGoogle actually recently responded to Amazon's Echo speaker with a home automation device of its own, the Google Home. The Home runs on Google's new voice assistant, which also powers its new Pixel phone and represents Google's new era of hardware/software interaction.(Also read:Google's New ""Home"" Internet of Things Device   Challenges Amazon Echo)Finally, SamsungSSNLFis another major player with its SmartThings brand. Samsung SmartThings are a series of in-home products, ranging from electric outlets to motion sensors, which allow for easier control of a users' entire home.Unsung HeroesThe technology giants will certainly be leaders in the IoT market, but investors should also look into the smaller companies that will be the manufacturers of the actual hardware. For every product IoT product sold by Apple, the supplier who built one of the components within the device also stands to benefit.One of Apple's key suppliers is Skyworks SolutionsSWKS. Skyworks is the industry leader in semiconductor manufacturing and currently produces a chip that is a vital part of the iPhone. Similar technology will be the backbone of the IoT movement, as semiconductors and sensors move beyond their usual homes in phones and computers and into our other household items. Skyworks is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Investors should also focus on some smaller cap stocks that have potential to grow in correlation with the IoT market. One such company would be Sierra WirelessSWIR, a wireless communications expert with a product line that should fit perfectly in the IoT market. Sierra is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Another company to consider is Iridium CommunicationsIRDM, a low-Earth orbit satellite company that has recently partnered with IoT platform providers as the industry has discovered a use for LEOs in connecting the world. IRDM currently has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Bottom LineThe Internet of Things has the potential to change the consumer electronics industry as we know it. The growth of the market will be another indication of humanity's expansion into an autonomous world, and investors need to start taking note of the IoT now.Whether you want to focus on the major technology players or the small companies at the heart of the IoT movement, the time is now to add this industry to your portfolio.Also, investors interested in the Internet of Things should check out this episode of theZacks Friday Finish Linepodcast:Zacks' Top 10 Stocks for 2017In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2017?Who wouldn't?

Why 42% Of Schwab Investors Are On The Prowl For Stocks;2/21/2017;"Investors know what they like, and they liked the November election results and December's interest-rate increase by the Federal Reserve.Those events prompted a jump in investors who have retail accounts withCharles Schwab(SCHW) to declare themselves bullish. In a fourth-quarter survey of those investors, Schwab found 42% of them said they now feel bullish. That was a big jump up from the 34% who felt that way in Q4 a year earlier.makeArticleAd();""As a result of the election, clients saw an increased prospect for a reduction in personal and corporate tax rates, an increased likelihood of spending on infrastructure, and an increased likelihood of a reduction in regulatory burdens for some industries,"" said Myhanh Hoskin, a Schwab financial consultant, who is based in Seal Beach, Calif. ""The rate increase was a sign of growing strength in the economy.""Amid that widespread perception that the stock market had become increasingly worth investing in, Schwab investors did as much buying as selling in the quarter.The top five U.S. holdings among all Schwab stock mutual funds wereApple(AAPL),Microsoft(MSFT),Exxon Mobil(XOM),Johnson & Johnson(JNJ) andJPMorgan Chase(JPM) as of Feb. 16, according to Morningstar Inc.Apple is up 17% year to date, while Microsoft is up 4%, Exxon is down 10%, Johnson & Johnson is up 3%, and JPMorgan is up 5%.In Schwab's survey of its clients, the general balance between buying and selling bodes well for the market in additional ways. ""It shows there isn't a sense of euphoria,"" Hoskin said. ""It shows caution by many investors. And that suggests that we're not seeing a market top. That is a good thing. When you have too many people doing the same thing, that tends to be a contrarian indicator.""On the other hand, only 13% of investors said their top concern about the market is that it appears overdue for a correction, suggesting a tone of overconfidence.In contrast, a whopping 88% said they are confident about reaching their financial goals.Allocations And OutlookInvestors had 41.3% of their money in stocks, 21.1% in cash, 18.8% in mutual funds, 11.9% in exchange traded funds, and 6.9% in fixed income.And 21% of those investors said they planned to move more money into stocks during the current first quarter.Stocks were the most popular planned destination for additional allocations.ETFs were the second most popular target asset, with 17% of investors saying that's where they planned to put more money.Mutual funds were the third most popular, with 15% of investors saying they would move money into them in Q1.Investors were more inclined to get help in making investment decisions.

These Are the 10-Most Admired Companies in the World;2/21/2017;"When the public votes for something the results can skew based   on perception, emotion, or sometimes even the desire to mess with   the outcome.That's how a $300 million state-of-the-art British polar   research ship earned the name ""Boaty McBoatface."" The question of   the ship's name was put to an internet vote, and while over 7,000   names were submitted, according toCNN, ""Boaty McBoatface"" won easily with 124,109 votes. Votes being   open to the public have given us many questionable,   past-their-prime Major League Baseball all-stars, as well as a   whale being tracked by Greenpeace being named Mr. Splashy   Pants.These are all ridiculous votes skewed by a playful public, but   they illustrate that sometimes open voting can produce less-than   reliable results. In creating its annualMost-Admired Companies ListFortune does not leave the question open to a public vote,   instead the publication works with its partner Korn Ferry Hay   Group to build a list and then survey executives from the   companies that make the initial cut.makeArticleAd();Image source: Getty.After starting with about 1,500 candidates (the 1,000 largest   U.S. companies ranked by revenue, along with non-U.S. companies   in Fortune's Global 500 database that have revenues of $10   billion or more), the selections are cut down to the   highest-revenue companies in each industry. That leaves 680   companies in 28 countries, and 3,800 insiders affiliated with   those companies voted on the list.""To determine the best-regarded companies in 51 industries,   Korn Ferry Hay Group asked executives, directors, and analysts to   rate enterprises in their own industry on nine criteria, from   investment value and quality of management and products to social   responsibility and ability to attract talent,"" Fortune explained.   This, as you can see, is not a fan vote, but an insider's   perspective on which companies are most admired by their own   executives, competitors, and people who should actually know.Apple topped the list of most-admired companies. Image     source: Apple.Which companies are the most admired?Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL)Amazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN)Starbucks(NASDAQ: SBUX)Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK-A) (NYSE: BRK-B)Disney(NYSE: DIS)Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL)General Electric(NYSE: GE)Southwest Airlines(NYSE: LUV)(Tie)Facebook(NASDAQ: FB) /Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT)Why is making this list important?While there's no definitive benefit to making a list             like this, there's a clear value in being well-regarded             by industry insiders. The 10 companies above are not             only successful, but those best-placed to judge are             saying they admire them, which should be taken as a             strong positive by shareholders and potential             investors.""Having the respect of your peers and your             competitors is absolutely crucial in business and             almost everywhere else,"" said Fortune's Assistant             Managing Editor Nicholas Varchaver in avideothat accompanied the list. ""Fortune's World's             Most-Admired Company's List is a list that embodies             precisely that idea.""This isn't a popularity contest or a thrown-off             quick vote. It's a fairly in-depth look at the             companies most-admired by business leaders. Making the             list suggests that these are brands that do things the             right way, companies with solid foundations likely to             not only be around for the long haul, but to continue             to thrive.Being held in this type of high regard by your             competitors may also come with actual advantages.             In-demand workers are likely to want to work for             companies they admire. The brands on this list likely             have an easier time recruiting top talent because they             are thought of this way and in competitive markets like             coders, top technology executives, and sales leaders,             that can be the difference between staying on top and             slipping to the back of the pack.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a               stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) Preparing a Red iPhone 7?;2/21/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) faces a challenge over the next six months. There's an all-new iPhone 8 expected in the fall. And rivalSamsung Electronics Co Ltd(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) is expected to pull out all the stops with a comeback Galaxy S8 in coming weeks. With the threat of AAPL fans holding onto their cash for the new iPhone and the risk of Samsung getting all the attention, how does the company keep sales of the relatively pedestrian iPhone 7 humming?makeArticleAd();Source: ColorWareIt sounds like AAPL may fall back to one of its favorite strategies: release a new color. If Japanese Apple blogMac Otakarais correct, we could see a red iPhone 7 in March.Apple Could Face a Big Dip in iPhone SalesAAPL is accustomed to cyclical fluctuations in its iPhone sales. The numbers tend to slow in the lead-up to the fall, when the new iPhone model is due to be released. However, this year, a confluence of factors could make that slowdown much more pronounced.The biggest factor is the iPhone 8. With the current iPhone 7, AAPL is winding down its first three-year product development cycle. That means the iPhone it's trying to convince people to buy for the next six months looks virtually identical to the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s.5 High-Tech Cash Cows Yielding Up To 6%That can already be a tough sell, but the iPhone 8 isn't only the start of a new cycle - meaning it will look different and offer somecompelling new features- it's the10th anniversary iPhone. Everyone is looking to Apple to make a splash. Why would you buy a plain Jane iPhone 7 now if the completely new (and possiblyradicallynew) iPhone 8 is just months away?Then there's the Galaxy S8. Samsung is Apple's traditional rival for selling premium, flagship smartphones. After having its reputation - and smartphone sales - torched by the Galaxy Note 7's exploding battery crisis, Samsung is looking to the Galaxy S8 to mark its comeback. That is going to make things tougher for Apple over the next six months when it comes to attracting fence sitters, upgraders and those buying their first smartphone.The Answer Is … A Red iPhone 7?Apple doesn't have many options here. It could cut iPhone 7 prices, but AAPLneverdoes that. It could push up the iPhone 8 release, butthat has many risks.Instead,Mac Otakarais suggesting Apple will go to one of the oldest strategies in its marketing bag:a new color. And not just any new color. The blog (which has a reputation for getting a lot of these prediction right) is suggesting AAPL will release a red iPhone 7 in March.Apple has a long history of introducing new colors as a low-risk, low-cost way of generating new interest in products that are getting long in the tooth. It perfected this strategy with the iPod line-up, that would get a rainbow of new colors every year. It has done so in a more subdued way with the iPad and MacBook, adding new variations like Rose Gold.It actually used the strategy once already with the iPhone 7, introducing a glossy, Jet Black option at launch.A red iPhone 7 would be the first time Apple has released such a bold color for its smartphones. I mocked one up using theskin generatorfromColorWare, a company that has been successful at marketing flashy new appearances for a wide range of consumer electronics. There's no doubt, a red iPhone 7 would be a looker.Apple could even release such a device under its(PRODUCT)REDbanner. This is a series of red Apple products that contribute toward a global fund to fight Aids. Most of these are accessories, but a red iPhone 7 would fit right in and offer the advantage of letting AAPL promote the smartphone as part of the (PRODUCT)RED initiative, making it seem less like a marketing ploy.Fossil Group Inc (FOSL) Stock Is Down, But Not OutAccording toMac Otakara, we should see the red iPhone 7 make an appearance in March, at an event where AAPL is expected to refresh its iPad Pro lineup. Will a bold and shiny new color be enough to keep iPhone sales humming in the lead-up to the iPhone 8?That's a good question and one that will have a material impact to Apple's bottom line this year. AAPL has few other options and it sounds like the company may be willing to roll the dice with a new red iPhone 7.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace9 Top Pharmaceutical Stocks to Buy for the Dividends7 Dividend Stocks for the Retirement You DeserveThe postIs Apple Inc.

Apple Inc. Reportedly Prepping 3 New iPhones for March Launch;2/21/2017;"Per a new report fromApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) -centric website Macotakara (viaMacRumors), Apple is prepping a couple of ""new"" iPhone models. The first   is a variant of the company's relatively low-cost, small-screen   iPhone SE with 128 gigabytes of storage (current models come with   either 16 or 64 gigabytes of storage).Additionally, Apple is reportedly planning to add new red   variants of both the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus to its   lineup.Image source: Apple.makeArticleAd();Let's take a closer look at what these new products could   potentially do for the company's iPhone business.The new iPhone SE could help boost blended average     selling prices... or unit shipmentsOn Apple's April 2016 earnings call, company CEO Tim Cook   explained that the iPhone SE ""is attracting two types of   customers.""The first set, he explained, are ""customers that wanted the   latest technology but wanted it in a more compact package.""""We clearly see even more people than we thought in that   category,"" Cook added.The second set of potential iPhone SE customers, per Cook,   were individuals ""who aspire to own an iPhone but couldn't quite   stretch to the entry price of the iPhone, and we've established a   new entry [with the iPhone SE].""The iPhone SE with 16 gigabytes of storage currently sells for   $399, with the 64-gigabyte version coming in at $449; the iPhone   6s with 32 gigabytes of storage sells for $549.With this rumored 128-gigabyte iPhone SE, Apple has two   potential ways to try to boost revenue.The first is that it can simply ax the 16-gigabyte iPhone SE   model and offer the 64-gigabyte version at the $399 price point   and the 128-gigabyte variant at the $449 price point that the   64-gigabyte version currently occupies.That course of action has the potential to reduce blended   average selling prices (perhaps as mix shifts down to the $399   64-gigabyte version), but it could also boost overall unit demand   as value-oriented customers may be more inclined to grab an   iPhone.Alternatively, Apple could simply add the 128-gigabyte iPhone   SE to the current lineup and charge, perhaps $549 for it. This   might not stimulate a lot more unit demand, but it could have the   effect of getting the portion of the iPhone SE-buying population   that is buying the iPhone SE for form factor and not for cost   reasons to buy a richer mix of products, helping to boost blended   average selling prices.It'll be interesting to see what Apple's ultimate go-to-market   strategy will be for this product -- assuming it's real.iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus in rougeApple has been steadily adding new color choices to its iPhone   lineup over the years. In 2013, Apple introduced gold, in 2015 we   got rose gold, and in 2016 we got black and jet black. It's   looking as though we're getting red this year.It's not clear how much impact bringing red color models into   the lineup will have on overall sales; after all, are there truly   potential customers out there that haven't purchased a new iPhone   but totallywouldhave purchased an iPhone if only it had come in red?For what it's worth, in a poll run by 9to5Mac, 106 voters out   of a total of 15,558 said that they were most excited about a red   option coming to the iPhone 8 -- losing to all other potential   optionsexceptfor ""speed improvements.""We'll see if the introduction of red iPhone 7 and iPhone 7   Plus has any real impact on iPhone sales soon enough, if this   rumor turns out to be true.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

(AMZN);2/21/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsU.S. stock futures are pointing to an extension of Wall Street's record run, as traders come back refreshed from the President's Day break.Home Depot Inc(NYSE:HD) is up on strong earnings results, whileWal-Mart Stores Inc's(NYSE:WMT) earnings are waiting in the wings. Meanwhile, the Markit February preliminary purchasing managers' manufacturing and services indexes are on tap later this morning.makeArticleAd();Against this backdrop, futures on theDow Jones Industrial Averageare up 0.29%, withS&P 500futures adding 0.18% andNasdaq-100futures up 0.17%.On the options front, volume remained brisk on Friday with about 18.6 million calls and 16.1 million puts changing hands on the session. Over on the CBOE, the single-session equity put/call volume ratio arrived at 0.59, while the 10-day moving average dropped to a two-month low of 0.63.Turning to Friday's volume leaders,Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) hit fresh all-time-high territory on Friday, following a new data on Apple Pay's acceptance at U.S. retailers. Elsewhere,Tesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) is seeing renewed call activity ahead of this Wednesday's quarterly earnings report andAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) tagged a new all-time high on Friday, joining the rest of the so-called ""FANG"" stocks in record territory.Apple Inc. (AAPL)Forget about iPhones and iPads, the new driver for AAPL stock is services. On Friday, a report emerged that one of those services,Apple Pay, is now accepted by 36% of U.S. retailers, with another 22% expected to start accepting the service in the next 12 months. The narrative on Apple Pay has only grown more bullish since CEO Tim Cook's statement that Apple Pay transactions were up 500% year-over-year in the most recent fiscal quarter.7 Stocks to Sell or Short Before the Bears StrikeAAPL options traders jumped on the report, sending more than 920,000 contracts across the tape on the shares. Furthermore, calls accounted for an above average 67% of the day's take. AAPL may be trading near all-time highs, but that hasn't stopped options traders from setting their sights even higher, with more than 36,000 call contracts open at the March $140 strike and another 8,500 at the $145 strike.With AAPL breaking through peak March call OI at $135 on Friday, look for options traders to adjust their targets even higher, resulting in another round of heavy call activity this week.Tesla Inc. (TSLA)Electric car guru Tesla is slated to take the earnings stage this Wednesday amid mixed sentiment. Wall Street is expecting a loss of 30 cents per share on revenue of $2.2 billion, though thewhisper numberis pricing in a wider loss of 41 cents per share.Per-share results may be moot, however, as traders will be looking for information on deliveries and Model 3 production, which is slated to begin this week.Tesla has more than 370,000 Model 3 preordersfor the Model 3 and CEO Elon Musk has promised production of 500,000 cars per year by 2018, but Tesla only delivered 76,000 vehicles in all of 2016.Options traders are naturally skeptical of TSLA stock, especially with the shares pulling back from their recent all-time highs. On Friday, TSLA options activity underscored that trepidation, with calls only eking out 51% of the more than 473,000 contracts traded. Currently, peak 24 Feb call OI totals 4,800 contracts at the $305 strike, while peak 24 Feb put OI numbers 1,900 at $260. Implieds are pricing in a roughly 7% move for TSLA stock following earnings.Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN)AMZN stock was the last of the so-called ""FANG"" stocks to reach all-time-high territory on Friday, though the shares are still stymied by overhead resistance at $850. However,Amazon may be ready for a breakout, and options traders appear to be preparing for additional upside.Friday's call activity came in slightly above average for AMZN, with these typically bullish bets accounting for 53% of the 302,000 contracts traded. Furthermore, the March put/call open interest ratio has steadily declined for the past couple of weeks.Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Is Itching to Break All-Time HighsWhile the ratio currently rests at a bearish leaning 1.22, it has dropped from a perch north of 1.30 as calls are added at a faster rate than puts - a trend that could signify options traders' expectations of additional gains for AMZN stock.As of this writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace9 Top Pharmaceutical Stocks to Buy for the Dividends5 Top Dividend Stocks to Shower Solid ReturnsThe postTuesday's Vital Data: Apple Inc.

Will Procter & Gamble (PG) Stock Stay Recession-Proof?;2/21/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsProcter & Gamble Co(NYSE:PG), historically one of the market's best recession insurance policies, has caught fire this year. PG stock is 8% mostly on expectations activist Nelson Peltz of Trian Fund Management can turn it into a high-flyer.makeArticleAd();Source:Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified)Trian has put$3.5 billioninto PG stock and now has about 2.4% of the common, which has a market cap of $240 billion.Trian's track record hints it will seek board seats and push for operational changes at the Cincinnati-based company. While the fund has yet to publish a white paper onits proposals, as it has done in the past, speculators aren't waiting and are already piling into PG stock to watch the fun.What might fun mean for Procter & Gamble in the event of a recession?P&G Is Recession InsurancePG stock has a stellar track record as a place to ride out tough times and has paid dividends continuously for more than 125 years. While the value fell during the 2008 crisis, from about $70 per share to $45, the dividend increased 10% and the share price was back to its 2007 level within one year.The same thing happened following the 2000 dot-com collapse. The PG stock price halved but the dividend was increased, and by 2002 it was again trading at pre-collapse levels. Procter & Gamble shares were barely touched in the 1987 crash, and after two hikes in the dividend, they split in 1989.7 Consumer Stocks That Will Knock Your Socks OffProcter & Gamble accomplished these financial miracles because its brands sell, come rain or come shine. Crest, Tide, Dawn, Bounty, Pampers - these are essentials consumers buy when they stop buying everything else.In the current recovery, Procter & Gamble has sought faster growth by consolidating brands, selling its Duracell battery unit toBerkshire Hathaway Inc.(NYSE:BRK.A) and itsbeauty products unitstoCoty Inc.(NYSE:COTY).What Peltz WantsThe balance sheet currently shows over $13 billion in cash and $18 billion in long-term debt on $127 billion in assets. Cash flow from operations tops $15 billion per year. To me, PG looks like a company poised to grow, not downsize, which is what Peltz usually wants.How can Peltz top what Procter has done already, slimming from 165 brands to 66, growing margins, raising the dividend and buying back shares to maintain the PG stock price?By focusing on short-term profits, Peltz could wind up hurting both P&G and the economy. A little fat is what you need to get through tough times. He could also hurt the larger economy. Procter's size enables it to focus on large issues likefixing the Internet advertising supply chain, currently a mass of incompatible metrics and unaccountable spending.So What Happens to PG Stock?Wall Street has all sorts of ideas for improving results, some of which Peltz might demand P&G directors adopt.Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Is Itching to Break All-Time HighsHe could push the company to adopt zero-based budgeting, as 3G Capital has done atKraft Heinz Co(NASDAQ:KHC) andRestaurant Brands International Inc(NYSE:QSR), which owns Burger King. The problem is that doesn't always work.Peltz could also demand a break up of Procter & Gamble, perhapsinto three units, forcing accountability on long-tenured staff and creating pressure to cut costs.Or, he could refocus P&G on developing markets, taking a page from the playbook atReckitt Benckiser Group Plc (ADR)(OTCMKTS:RBGLY), buying product categories that appeal to Asian consumers and selling the rest.

HD's top-line beat wasn't as dramatic, but revs of $22.21 billion were enough to beat the mark of $21.8 billion. That came on comparable-store sales that improved by 5.8%, well ahead of expectations for 3.7%.The company also projected revenue and comps growth of 4.6% for full-year 2017, as well as the opening of six new stores.The 10 Best Oil Stocks to Buy Now for Big-Time GainsDividend investors had plenty to cheer about, too, as the quarterly payout on HD stock was hiked by 29% to 89 cents per share.

3 Best Stocks for Your Roth IRA;2/20/2017;"They say that there are only two certainties in life: death   and taxes. While you can't cheat death and better not cheat on   your taxes, you can at least avoid paying Uncle Sam taxes on any   gains earned from investments held in a Roth IRA. That's why we   think that the best stocks to own in a Roth are ones that will   likely have generated substantial gains by the time you   retire.Three that we think fit that bill areApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) ,Paycom Software(NYSE: PAYC) , andMedical Properties Trust(NYSE: MPW) .Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();Reducing HR headaches and generating profitsDaniel Miller(Paycom Solutions):Roth IRAs have become wildly popular in recent years, and it's   pretty easy to understand why. The big selling point for a Roth   IRA is that money contributed can grow completely tax-free for   life. That means investors should focus on companies that can   grow and compound over decades; when you withdraw the money in   retirement, you won't pay a dime on those earnings.For that reason, if you have decades as your investing   horizon, you should lean toward slightly more risky investments   that could end up being big winners by retirement -- think small-   and mid-cap stocks. One that's high on my list is Paycom   Solutions.Paycom Solutions is a leading provider of innovative,   cloud-based, human capital management software that helps   companies lower labor costs and drive employee engagement. The   stock's been on fire, driven by both its top- and bottom-line   gains:PAYCdata byYCharts.Here's why you should like the stock long-term for a Roth IRA.   First, the company has a strong competitive advantage since once   HR departments use Paycom, it becomes time-consuming, difficult,   and expensive to switch away from using its software products.   That's driven its retention rate to a staggering 91%.Another reason to buy into the stock is that CEO Chad Richison   owns roughly 13% of shares outstanding, aligning his interests   directly with individual investors. Paycom also boasts a strong   balance sheet due to the software-as-a-service (SaaS) business   model being cloud-based and thus capital-light. These factors   make Paycom look intriguing to hold in a Roth IRA over the coming   decades.Sit back and collect a healthy income streamMatt DiLallo(Medical Properties Trust):One of the many benefits of a Roth IRA is that investors never   pay taxes on the gains, which include both capital gains and   dividend income. The tax savings on dividend income can be   substantial, especially for high-yield investments like real   estate investment trusts. It's why REITs make great investments   for a Roth IRA.One of my favorite REITs is Medical Properties Trust. The   company currently owns 247 hospitals across the U.S. and Europe   that it leases to hospital operators. These companies run the   hospitals and pay Medical Properties rent each month, which it   returns to investors in the form of a very healthy 7.2% dividend   yield.While a yield that high is sometimes an ominous sign, that is   not the case at Medical Properties Trust. The company spent much   of the past year strengthening its balance sheet, and as a   result, it has one of the lowest leverage ratios among healthcare   REITs. It also pays out less than 80% of its cash flow via   dividends, which provides a little extra cushion as well as some   seed money to fund additional acquisitions.Speaking of acquisitions, they are Medical Properties' primary   growth driver. The company has grown its size at a 30% compound   annual rate over the past five years by acquiring additional   hospital properties, enabling it to increase the dividend by 15%   since the start of 2014. With a largely untapped market in front   of it, the company anticipates that it can invest between $500   million to $1 billion per year to acquire new properties, which   should provide healthy dividend growth for years to come.Focusing on this company's solid dividendBrian Stoffel(Apple):I think putting soliddividend   stocksin your Roth IRA makes a lot of sense. That's because price   appreciation via quarterly payments is a pretty sure bet. And   unlike a traditional IRA, you'll never have to pay taxes on any   of that appreciation. I like to save my higher-risk,   higher-reward investments for my traditional IRA.That's why I would suggest investing your Roth money in Apple,   which I'm betting will increase its dividend payments over the   years.While I'll admit that the company's moat is constricted by the   fact that it needs to continue coming up with the Next Big Thing,   this is a dividend stock that shouldn't be ignored. Currently   yielding 1.8%, Apple only used 23% of its $54 billion in free   cash flow over the past year. Not only that, but the company also   has almost a quartertrillionin cash, in long and short-term investments.While the days of heady growth may have passed, that cash will   likely be returned to shareholders. There are lots of different   ways this could happen. One could be a simple realization on the   part of management that the company has tapped out most of its   investable growth avenues. Already, this move is underway under   CEO Tim Cook, as it previously didn't offer a dividend. The other   is under even more aggressive share repurchases, which the   company is already doing -- but could continue indefinitely.   Furthermore, under the Trump administration, the company could be   allowed to make a one-time transfer of overseas cash without a   big tax impact and that would create a rather large one-time boon   that could be paid out to shareholders.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

"This Guru Loves Valeant; Should You?";2/20/2017;"Hedge funds' final 13F forms for 2016 were published last week, and as usual, the data has been scrutinized by the financial media. There were a few surprises in the figures, includingWarren Buffett(Trades,Portfolio)'s new favorite position,Apple(AAPL), and the general rotation away from tech toward financials.One position change that stands out, however, is not Buffett's move but that ofFrancis Chou(Trades, Portfolio). Chou's Chou Associates is a traditional value fund, and Chou is well known in the value community for his investing style.Since inception, the Chou Associates Fund has achieved an average annual return for investors of around 12% by following Chou's value style. Before purchasing distressed securities, he asks the following questions:makeArticleAd();What would be left if the company was forced to liquidate?How competent is the management?Is the underlying business strong enough to generate consistent cash flow?Does the company have a strong enough balance sheet to make it worth the risk?He's looking for a company with strong management that's fallen out of favor with the market, that's cheap and not going to go out of business anytime soon. With these investment criteria in mind, some might wonder why Chou Associates increased its position in struggling pharmaceutical company Valeant during the fourth quarter.What's with Valeant?Chou has not been aValeant(VRX) supporter for long when compared to the likes of Bill Ackman (Trades, Portfolio). The fund first started buying the company in the first quarter of 2016 after the stock had more than halved in price from its $250 per share high. Chou continued to buy in the second quarter, adding 470,000 shares to his existing basket of 980,000 shares acquired during the first three months of the year. For the final quarter of 2016, Chou increased his position further by 36% or 514,000 shares. Overall, the stock now accounts for 9.4% of Chou's overall portfolio, the third-largest position afterJPMorgan(JPM) andBerkshire Hathaway(NYSE:BRK.A).The big question is, what should investors make of this buying by Chou? Does his buying signal there's value on offer at Valent?Value on offer?Interestingly, Chou is one of the only fund managers to own Valent. Jeff Ubben's ValueAct Capital and Ackman are the only other managers to own substantial positions in the firm. This either means Chou sees something most don't, or he's lost it, which is what most people tend to think when a manager takes a nonconsensus position.Even though Chou is the only hedge fund manager buying the stock, Valent isn't as unloved as most believe. In a substantial vote of confidence for the company, management is also becoming one of the company's largest investors. Last year, while Chou was adding to his position management acquired over $5 million of stock for itself, a strong signal that it believes the company can return to health.But even if management is optimistic about Valent's outlook, the one thing that's certain about the company is that its financials are a car crash and an accident waiting to happen. Even though the current management team has managed to lock in $2.1 billion of acquisitions, debt remains high at $30 billion. Another $8 billion of acquisitions is currently in the cards. The company is dependent upon the kindness of capital markets to keep the lights on. If creditors get spooked, there's no chance the group will be able to meet its obligations, and that's a big red flag for value investors.Still, the company is not a total basket case. Indeed, JPMorgan analyst Chris Schott and team are expecting the group to report solid earnings figures this year, making the stock look cheap on a forward basis:""Following Valeant's recently announced divestitures and ahead of 2017 guidance, we wanted to refresh estimates and update our outlook for Valeant. We are again lowering our estimates to reflect 1) the company's recently announced asset sales, 2) a more conservative view of Valeant's diversified products division, and 3) FX headwinds. Our new 2017 EPS and EBITDA estimates are $4.30 billion and ~$3.7 billion.""Disclosure:The author owns no stock mentioned.Start a free seven-day trial of Premium Membership to GuruFocus.Premium MembersThis article first appeared onGuruFocus."

3 Companies That Need to Kick Their CEO to the Curb;2/19/2017;"Sometimes, changes need to be made to the top because of   deep-rooted organizational problems. Other times, someone else is   necessary to take a company to the next level. Our Motley Fool   contributors think it may be time for changes in management atFitbit(NYSE: FIT) ,Depomed(NASDAQ: DEPO) , andTwitter(NYSE:TWTR) . Read on to see why they think these companies might do   better under someone else.Say it isn't soTim Brugger(Fitbit): When co-founder and CEO James Park announced preliminary fourth   quarter and 2016 annual results on Jan. 30 there was little   to like. Fitbit's poor revenue results are expected to be   well below analyst estimates, and Fitbit will shave overhead   primarily through job cuts impacting ""approximately 110 people,""   equal to 6% of its workforce. And the worst was yet to come.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();Despite tepid revenue growth, Fitbit's gross margins will be   ""materially below its previously issued 46% forecast"" due to   excess inventory. Fitbit sales are on an uptick, but not close to   expectations. But the news that warrants Park being on the wrong   end of a kick -- if not to the curb, then awfully close --   is Fitbit's plan to enter the smartwatch wars.The move to join the likes ofApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) and its Watch wasn't surprising given Fitbit's   recent acquisitions of Pebble and Vector Watch software assets,   but Park's decision is still wrong. Apple knows first-hand the   smartwatch boom many had expected hasn't materialized.According to IDC 2016's third calendar quarter was dismal for   smartwatch sales, declining 52%. The Apple Watch no longer has   the appeal of being new which resulted in a 72% nosedive to 1.1   million units. And Fitbit wants to join the sinking smartwatch   ship?If watches actually become ""smart"" rather than expensive   fitness trackers the market may change. But if it does, how many   consumers will opt for Fitbit over Apple orSamsung? And Fitbit will spend massive resources to develop its device,   above the acquisitions already squandered. Park is leading Fitbit   into a battle that's already lost.Investors could lobby for change at the topTodd Campbell(Depomed): Activist investor Starboard Value L.P. took a nearly 10% stake   in drugmaker Depomed last year to lobby for a sale, but so far,   little has happened to encourage investors that will happen, and   as a result, Depomed's shares have sunk 46% since July   2015.Initially, Depomed's board of directors clashed with Starboard   Value's Jeff Smith. However, the board agreed last fall to allow   Smith to pick three people to join Depomed's board of directors.   Also, because Smith had been critical of management's rejection   of a $33 per share offer fromHorizon Pharma(NASDAQ: HZNP) in mid-2015, the board agreed to entertain bids   from suitors.Unfortunately, Depomed's full-throttle rejection of Horizon   Pharma's prior bid appears to have soured Horizon Pharma on   making another offer. Rumors of interest from Purdue Pharma,   the maker of the top selling Oxycontin, appear off-the-mark, and   reported interest from investment firm KKR hasn't led to a deal   either.Absent a buyer, I think pressure will mount on Depomed CEO Jim   Schoeneck to prove to investors that his course is the right   one. Previously, rapid sales growth for Depomed's opioid   pain medicine, Nucynta, helped Schoeneck make his case, but   opioid prescriptions have slumped on rising concern over abuse,   and that's slowing Nucynta's momentum.While Depomed hasn't reported its fourth-quarter figures yet,   anemic results in Q3, including 5% year-over-year top-line   growth, prompted Schoeneck to kick-off the company's third   quarter earnings conference call admitting that quarterly   results ""fell well short of our expectations.""Given Depomed's shares are trading at about half the price   that Horizon Pharma was once willing to pay, and sales growth is   slowing, it wouldn't shock me if Starboard's next move is to   lobby for replacing Schoeneck. Whether someone else would do   better is anyone's guess, but bruised investors are eager for   some positive news out of this company, and that could mean that   change is coming.Hey hey, ho ho, Jack Dorsey has got to go!Rich Smith(Twitter): Jack Dorsey, ladies and gentleman! Let's give him a hand -- and   then show him the door!Jack Dorsey co-founded internet icon Twitter in 2006. For   this, he deserves to be congratulated, as Twitter has ultimately   grown into perhaps the most important tool for monitoring   breaking news on the internet. Where Dorsey has failed, however,   is in taking this leading internet platform -- one so useful that   the President of the United States has adopted it as his go-to   medium for communicating with the public -- and finding a way to   earn a profit from it.I mean, think about this for a second: Twitter has more than   300millionmonthly users. Donald Trump made Twitter an integral part of his   winning presidential campaign and continues to tweet from   the Oval Office. These days, you can't open up a newspaper   without seeing a headline about some bit of breaking news from   the White House that first appeared on Twitter. And yet, in the   same quarter in which Donald Trump was elected President, Twitter   experienced literally zero user growth, achieved only single   digit revenue growth -- and made no profit whatsoever.Apologies for speaking so bluntly here, but while Dorsey has   the right tool in hand, he clearly doesn't know how to use it.   Hand this guy a hammer, and he'd try to open a can of beans with   it -- and fail.WithTwitter stocknow down 73% from its highs of 2013, and down 40% from when   Dorsey re-took over the business as CEO in October 2015, enough   is enough. Jack Dorsey had his chance to fix Twitter's business,   and he failed. It's time to place a want-ad and hire a   handyman who can use this tool to finally earn Twitter stock   owners some profit.10 stocks we like better than TwitterWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Is Apple, Inc. About to Kill Touch ID?;2/19/2017;"Touch ID has been an unqualified success. By integrating   biometric security into iPhones,Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) raised the bar in terms of what consumers expect   of their smartphones, and rivals expectedly followed suit by   implementing their own fingerprint sensors shortly thereafter.   But there's been some speculation for years that Apple is   interested in removing the home button on future iPhones, which   just so happens to be where the Touch ID sensor is integrated.   Meanwhile, it may adopt some sort of 3D facial recognition oriris scanningtechnology to bolster the iPhone's biometric security.Would Apple really kill Touch ID altogether?Rumor has itThat's the theory thatJPMorgananalyst Rod Hall is putting forth (viaMacRumors). Hall believes that Apple will finally pull the trigger on   killing the home button with the iPhone 8, Apple's   10th-generation iPhone due out later this year. This would allow   the company to implement an edge-to-edge display. Apple is   reportedly looking to include a 3D laser scanner that would allow   for facial recognition, a component that runs around $10 to   $15.makeArticleAd();Touch ID made Apple Pay possible. Image source: Apple.Hall notes that Touch ID sometimes fails, like in wet   conditions. iPhones have been getting progressively more   waterproof, so using Touch ID under wet conditions is more common   nowadays. Facial recognition could work more seamlessly, and   could even be used for Apple Pay authentication. It's also worth   pointing out that since facial recognition is very   software-intensive, the performance would likely be able to   improve over time via software updates as the recognition   algorithms improve over time. It's even possible that the laser   scanner could be used for augmented reality applications,   something CEO Tim Cook has beendiscussing at lengthin recent months, which could similarly be added later on via a   software update.Third-party developers might eventually even get access to a   3D scanning application programming interface (API), which has   the potential to unleash a wave of innovation.Will Touch ID join the headphone jack?If you recall, Touch ID was based on Apple's 2012 acquisition   ofAuthenTec for $356 million, which itself was a clear signal that Apple was planning on   integrating fingerprint sensors. Touch ID would debut the   following year in 2013's iPhone 5S, and subsequently made its way   throughout the iPhone portfolio. While it would be a shame to   shutter Touch ID, Apple has sold 690 million total iPhones and   generated nearly $450 billion in iPhone revenue since the iPhone   5S launch, so it certainly got its money worth from the   acquisition since Touch ID has been a key feature that   contributed to sales growth ever since.2016 MacBook Pros with Touch Bar were the first Macs to get     Touch ID. Image source: Apple.What's more peculiar, however, is the fact that Apple only   recently brought Touch ID to the Mac in last year's MacBook Pros   with Touch Bar. This was widely seen as a starting point, and   Apple is expected to subsequently bring Touch ID to the rest of   the Mac lineup. Apple is already testing out stand-alone   keyboards with Touch ID for Mac desktops, according to a   Bloomberg report from December.Instead of killing Touch ID, Apple should just supplement it   with facial recognition instead of replacing it since Touch ID   has become an integral part of how users interact with their   devices. Until Apple's fall event, which will probably be in   September as usual, we won't know if Touch ID will suffer the   same fate as the headphone jack.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Is the iPad Dead?;2/19/2017;"Less than four years ago, it seemed plausible thatApple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) iPad product line was on track todominate the tablet marketand upend the global PC market.Today, that idea looks laughable. iPad sales have been in free   fall for years. Potential catalysts like the launch of the   business-friendly iPad Pro lineup, the availability of cheaper   iPads, and the aging of the iPad installed base have all failed   to reinvigorate sales.With this backdrop, it's reasonable to wonder if the iPad's   immense popularity was just a fad. There's still a chance for the   iPad to make a modest comeback, though -- and if that's going to   happen, it will almost certainly begin within the next year.makeArticleAd();The launch of the iPad Pro hasn't boosted iPad sales. Image     source: Apple.iPad sales continue to declineApple posted its first full-year iPad sales dip in fiscal   2014. Unit sales slipped 4% that year, while revenue fell 5%.The sales declines accelerated thereafter. In fiscal 2015,   unit sales plunged 19% and revenue dropped by 23%. In fiscal   2016, unit sales fell another 17%, while revenue tumbled 11%.   Double-digit declines along both metrics continued in the first   quarter of fiscal 2017.The net result is that Apple shipped just 42.6 million iPads   during the 2016 calendar year, down about 40% from the peak a few   years ago. In its most recent annual report, it blamed the   decline in iPad sales on cannibalization by other products (most   notably phablets like the iPhone 6 Plus and its successors) and a   long replacement cycle for iPads. The strong dollar may have also   hurt sales outside the U.S.Does the iPad have a future?Despite the weak sales trend, CEO Tim Cook reiterated on the   company's recent earnings call that he is bullish about the   iPad's long-term trajectory. Sales grew at a double-digit rate in   India and Mainland China last quarter. The iPad continues to gain   traction in the corporate sector. Moreover, customer satisfaction   remains extremely high.Thus, the big problem is that people who bought iPads several   years ago don't seem to be replacing their devices. The first   four full-size iPad generations and the original iPad Mini -- all   of which debuted between 2010 and 2012 -- still account formore than 45% of iPad usage, according to Fiksu.It's becoming less and less plausible that a big iPad   replacement cycle is right around the corner. The iPad's heyday   was from fiscal 2012 to fiscal 2014. During that period, Apple   sold an average of 65.8 million iPads per year, bringing in over   $30 billion of revenue annually. Those devices are now three to   five years old. Even if iPads are destined to have a PC-like   upgrade cycle of four or five years, Apple should already be   benefiting from a wave of upgrades.Still, the high price tag of the iPad Pro and the lack of   updates to cheaper iPads (the iPad Air 2 was launched in 2014 and   the iPad Mini 4 debuted in 2015) haven't helped. It's possible   that an upgrade of the full iPad product lineup could get sales   growing again.Old iPad models have proven to be good enough for most     consumers. Image source: Apple.New iPads on the wayIf that's the case, then help may be on the way. Many Apple   watchers expect the company to roll out an updated iPad lineup   this spring, perhaps as soon as next month.There isn't a consensus as to how many new iPads will be   unveiled or what sizes they will be. Highly followed analyst   Ming-Chi Kuo has predicted thatthree new iPads-- successors to both versions of the iPad Pro as well as a   cheaper 9.7"" replacement for the iPad Air 2 -- will be released.   Other pundits expect Apple to release a new iPad Mini (either   called the iPad Mini 5 or the iPad Pro Mini).Given how easy the year-over-year comparisons are these days,   the simultaneous release of three or more new models ought to get   iPad sales growing again. Still, investors need to curb their   enthusiasm. The current versions of the iPad Pro haven't sold all   that well. The older iPad Air 2 and the iPad mini lineup have   been far more popular over the past year, indicating that most   consumers aren't willing to pay $600 or more for an iPad   anymore.Of course, the most ardent iPad fans will still shell out big   bucks for the latest and greatest models. Apple may also drop the   prices of the first-generation iPad Pro and the iPad Mini 4. That   could lure more price-sensitive customers to upgrade their aging   iPads. But the iPad product line may never return to its previous   peak in terms of sales and profitability.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Is This the Next Industry Amazon Wants to Conquer?;2/19/2017;"Just days after announcing its 2016 fourth-quarter results,Amazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ: AMZN) issued apress releasewith a bold headline: ""More than 33 Million Customers Have Used   Amazon Payments to Make a Purchase."" The release was seemingly   out of left field. In the conference call for the previous   quarter -- held less than a week before the press release was   issued -- Amazon's management failed to mention Amazon Payments   even once.Image source: Amazon.com, Inc.makeArticleAd();That's not to say the rare detailed look Amazon management   gave us into the numbers wasn't impressive -- it was. The release   gave plenty of updated stats on its Pay with Amazon service, a   platform that allows shoppers to make purchases from third-party   websites using the payment information from their Amazon   account. As the headline proclaimed, more than 33 million   customers have now used Pay with Amazon to make a purchase. The   platform's payment volume doubled in 2016. Active merchants   accepting Amazon Payments grew 120% year over year. More than 50%   of the customers who used the platform were also Amazon Prime   members.How does Amazon Payments compare?Amazon Payments is the latest payment platform that allows   customers to pay for online purchases from a number of different   websites using one account. It joinsPayPal Holdings Inc(NASDAQ: PYPL) andApple Inc's(NASDAQ: AAPL) Apple Pay as other popular digital wallets with   a built-in customer base.In Apple's 2017 fiscal first-quarter conference call, CEO Tim   Cook had some very positive things to say about Apple Pay. Among   other things, Cook said that during the past year the number of   Apple Pay users had tripled and transaction volume for the   quarter was up 500% year over year.Image source: Visa Inc.While it's hard to make an apples-to-apples comparisons   (pardon the pun), PayPal is the unquestioned leader in this   space. In its most recently reported quarter, PayPal had 197   million active accounts, each averaging a shade more than 31   transactions per month. The company's total payment volume was   reported at more than $99 billion, a 25% increase year over   year.The reason why these numbers don't easily compare is because   Apple and Amazon are still in the nascent stages of their efforts   and, as such, are working from much smaller bases. PayPal's   active accounts represent customers who are making regular   purchases or transactions. In Amazon's press release, the   trumpeted 33 million customers were just customers who had used   the platformonce, a far different metric than customers who are regularly engaged   with the platform.Online merchant coverage -- the availability of a company's   payment processing service -- is another arena where PayPal holds   a big lead. In a September 2016surveyconducted by PYMNTS.com, of the top 965 online merchants, 652, or   roughly 68%, featured PayPal's ""Buy"" buttons. In second place was   Amazon, with 101 websites featuring its button. No other   competing payment service was featured on more than 10% of the   websites surveyed. Since that was the same month Apple Pay users   could begin using its service to make payments on the web, stats   were not yet available for its merchant coverage.Furthermore, while the percentage gain in users, transactions,   and payment volume for both Apple Pay and Amazon Payments were   certainly impressive, they were coming off much smaller bases   than PayPal's much higher numbers. That doesn't mean these two   companies might not overtake PayPal as the dominant digital   wallet one day, just that it is far too early to make such a   prediction.PayPal is still the top dog -- for nowPayPal still emerges as the top digital wallet among   consumers. Its base of almost 200 million active accounts and   impressive online merchant coverage will be a tough moat to   overcome, even by rivals with such deep pockets as Amazon and   Apple. Furthermore, PayPal shows no sign of slowing growth. The   company's number of active accounts, payment transactions, and   total payment volume were all up by double-digit percentages in   its most recently reported quarter.Nor is PayPal resting on its laurels. Innovative and popular   new products like One Touch arepowering mobile growthand it continues to increase market share in thegrowing e-commerce movement.But none of that should take away what Amazon Payments and   Apple Pay have the potential to accomplish in this space. Apple   Pay has legions of loyal iPhone users. Last quarter alone, Apple   sold more than 78 million iPhones.Amazon has a loyal base of about 63 million Amazon Prime   members. This gives it a lot of room for growth with customers   who already use their Amazon.com account for online purchases.   Amazon's biggest challenge might be convincing more merchants to   give them access to what their customers are buying. With all the   data Amazon already has on digital spending trends, competing   merchants might be reluctant to give up more data to the online   retail giant.At the end of the day, it is hard to recommend buying Amazon   or Apple solely on their efforts in payments. Both companies   sport some of the largest market caps in the world and feature   lots of moving parts. But the impressive growth their respective   payment platforms are seeing should not be overlooked, and should   probably be considered as yet another catalyst for both   businesses.Find out why Amazonis one of the 10 best stocks to buy nowMotley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more     than a decade beating the market.

Universal Display Stock Has a Lot to Prove on Thursday;2/19/2017;"The market's warming up toUniversal Display(NASDAQ: OLED) again. The consumer electronics display specialist   is closing in on the all-time highs it set last summer, and it   will have a chance to justify the bullish attention that it's   been garnering when it reports fresh financials on Thursday   afternoon.We know what analysts are expecting to see out of the   patent-rich pioneer of OLED -- short for organic light   emitting diode -- technology. They see revenue climbing 10% to   $68.6 million for the fourth quarter. Wall Street pros are   holding out for a somewhat similar gain on the bottom line,   targeting a profit of $0.42 a share after earning $0.39 a share a   year earlier.This may seem like lukewarm growth and a weak revenue haul for   a company closing in on a $3.4 billion market cap, but Universal   Display's real value rests in its intellectual property.   Universal Display owns or has license rights to more than 4,200   issued or pending patents.makeArticleAd();Image source: Universal Display.Seeing the lightUniversal Display has championed OLED as an energy-efficient   lighting source for TVs, monitors, and appliance displays, but   the real potential for growth these days lies in mobile. There   are already a few smartphones with OLED screens on the market,   though for now it's limited mostly to high-end Android devices.   That could change ifApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) finally embraces the platform, asmany expect it to dolater this year.Apple is widely expected to shake things up for this year's   smartphone update. This summer will mark 10 years since the   original iPhone launched, and signs point to the iPhone 8 or   iPhone X shifting to wireless charging, as well as OLED   displays.OLED offers smartphone makers the ability to extend battery   lives and make devices that are leaner and more flexible. The   real surprise here is if Apple doesn't make the jump.Analysts already see a big jump in revenue and earnings for   Universal Display in 2017. They anticipate revenue and earnings   per share climbing 27% and 47%, respectively, this year.   Universal Display will hopefully shed some light on its near-term   prospects, even if it will naturally be tight-lipped on anything   that Apple may be up to on the OLED front.Universal Display's stock is on fire. The shares have soared   28% year to date and are up 51% since bottoming out in October.   That's a lot of helium in the stock heading into Thursday's   report, but bulls will argue that the potential for OLED -- and   Universal Display's role as both a patent holder and distributor   of materials -- is just now starting to be tapped.10 stocks we like better than Universal     DisplayWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Could This Oil Stock Really Become the Next Apple?;2/19/2017;"Pioneer Natural Resources(NYSE: PXD) has long believed that it's sitting on one of -- if   notthe-- biggest oil fields in the world. In fact, so much   low-cost oil saturates the rocks beneath the land it controls in   thePermian Basinof western Texas that the company recently unveiled a bold   decade-long plan to develop this resource. What's remarkable   about that plan is that the production from new wells will fuel   more than 20% annual cash flow growth over the next 10 years even   ifoil   pricesdon't budge.That's elite-level cash flow growth that, according to an   analysis byJPMorgan, only 15 companies have eclipsed over the past decade. Among   those cash flow growth kings were tech giantsApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) ,Amazon, andAlphabet. Given the historical performance of those tech giants and the   others on the list, Pioneer's ambitious growth plan could fuel   its stock to deliver market-thrashing returns in the years   ahead.Sands Weems. Image source: Pioneer Natural Resources.makeArticleAd();Already a step aheadPioneer Natural Resources is one of the few oil companies that   has consistently grown production during the oil market's recent   downturn. The company has increased output every quarter since   oil prices collapsed in 2014, with last year's production up 15%   versus 2015. Contrast this with similarly sized rivals like   Bakken Shale-focusedContinental Resources(NYSE: CLR) or diversified shale drillerEncana(NYSE: ECA) . In Continental Resources' case, its production was   down 4.3% year over year in 2016 while Encana's output slumped   double-digits due in part to asset sales.The reason Pioneer could continue growing was due to its   cash-rich balance sheet and the fact it earns higher returns on   new wells thanks to the unique properties of the Permian.   Currently, Pioneer Natural Resources' internal rates of return on   new wells in the Basin will range from 50% to 100% assuming $55   oil and $3 natural gas this year. Contrast this with Encana,   which earns a minimum 35% return from its best wells at those   prices or Continental's 40% return for Bakken wells at $55 oil.   Those higher returns enable Pioneer to generate more cash flow,   which it can reinvest to grow faster than its rivals.Drilling down into the planAs those returns suggest, Pioneer Natural Resources controls   some prime drillable land. Thanks to a series of smart   acquisitions and organic leasing, the company currently holds a   785,000-acre position that it built up over the past two decades.   The company believes that there are as much as 11 billion barrels   of oil equivalent resources underneath that land, which it can   extract through an estimated 20,000 future drilling   locations.At current oil prices, the company anticipates that it can   generate sufficient cash flow to drill enough new wells each year   to boost its production by 15% annually over the next decade.   That would grow the company's output from an average of 234,000   barrels of oil equivalent per day last year (BOE/D) up to an even   1 million BOE/D by the end of 2026. Moreover, due to the   high-margin nature of these wells, it would grow Pioneer Natural   Resources' cash flow by a more than 20% compound annual rate over   that same time frame assuming no further improvement in crude   prices.Image source: Getty Images.Putting things into perspectiveThose metrics would put the company in an elite category. For   example, if it achieved its cash flow grow target, it would   generate more than $10 billion in operating cash flow in 2026, up   from $1.5 billion last year. Just to put that into perspective,   big oil giantConocoPhillips(NYSE: COP) generated roughly $4.4 billion in cash flow from   operating activities last year on more than 1.5 million BOE/D of   production. Though, to be fair, ConocoPhillips' realized price   per BOE was $28.35 last year, so its cash flow would have been   higher using Pioneer's commodity price assumptions.However, it's the sheer rate of Pioneer's growth that is so   remarkable, not just for an oil producer, but when taken in the   context of the broader market. As previously mentioned, JPMorgan   found that just 15 stocks in the entire Russell 1000 Index have   grown cash flow by more than 20% annually over a 10-year period,   with the bulk of that elite group made up of tech giants such as   Apple. Needless to say, that steadily growing cash flow has done   wonders for their stock prices:AAPLdata byYCharts.In fact, according to the bank's research, these 15 stocks   have delivered an average total shareholder return of 662% over   that timeframe, or an average yearly return of nearly 19%. That's   not to say Pioneer will match those returns, but it's 10-year   growth forecast certainly gives it the fuel to deliver   market-beating returns as long as oil prices don't collapse   again. Meanwhile, if prices rise above Pioneer's outlook, it   would likely grow cash flow by an even healthier clip.Bottom line, Pioneer Natural Resources's forecast makes it a   stock that growth investors should seriously consider.10 stocks we like better than Pioneer Natural     ResourcesWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

2 Top Internet-of-Things Stocks to Buy Now;2/18/2017;"The Internet of Things (IoT) is a $19 trillion   opportunity, according to formerCisco SystemsCEO John Chambers. That figure may be overstating it, but the IoT   does present one of the most significant investment opportunities   of our times.One of the best ways to invest in broad-based movements such   as the IoT is by buying shares in the companies that supply the   hardware and infrastructure powering the trend -- such asSkyworks Solutions(NASDAQ: SWKS) andNXP Semiconductor(NASDAQ: NXPI) . Let's dig into each company to see what makes   them two of the top IoT investments on the market today.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();Skyworks SolutionsThough it manufactures about 2,500 kinds of   chips, Skyworks Solutions mostly touches on a single theme   with its products: making complex connectivity tasks simple. For   example, Skyworks' chips power a number of mission-critical tasks   inApple's iPhones, such as solving connection interference problems,   increasing data transfer speeds, and saving battery   power. The company's unique ability to offer turnkey   solutions for important tasks like this has made it a go-to   supplier for mobile devices, a trend that will only grow with the   continued rise of the IoT.Skyworks' compelling value proposition continues to reveal   itself in its quarterly results. In its most recent quarter,   Skyworks increased sales 9% sequentially to $914 million, which   also helped the company establish a new record for quarterly free   cash flow and net income. The company's financial   performance stands a strong chance of accelerating later this   year, thanks to the anticipated debut of Apple's redesigned   iPhone; the Mac maker accounts for 40% of Skyworks' sales via its   contract manufacturing partner,Foxconn. Overall, the company should be able to maintain its   above-average earnings growth for years to come. The analyst   community estimates that Skyworks will grow its EPS at an average   annual rate of 14.7% over the next five years.Trading at 18 times its last 12 months'   earnings. Skyworks Solutions looks like an appealing way to   play the rise of the IoT.NXP SemiconductorDutch IoT player NXP Semiconductor specializes in enabling   secure connections between devices, which makes the company a   candidate for strong growth as the number of devices that ""talk""   with one another increases in the years to come. The company   enjoys market leadership positions across a host of   connected-device applications, including automotive in-car   networking and near-field communication, to name just a   few. Its various leadership positions also provide NXP with   a strong margin profile, as seen in its 48% GAAP gross margin   last quarter. This situation allows NXP to reinvest in R&D,   which spurs further innovation and extends its market leadership   in a virtuous cycle that CEO Rick Clemmer and team have   implemented to great effect.However, for all of NXP's opportunity, investing in the   company also comes with some important risks. Last October, for   instance, it agreed to a buyout offer from chip giantQualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM) for $110 per share; its shares trade at $102 at   the time of this writing. Qualcomm's offer was an all-cash   deal, meaning that participating in NXP's continued growth will   require investors buy Qualcomm stock outright after the buyout   closes. But the outlook for Qualcomm's business -- aside from NXP   -- hasworsenedin the months since news of the NXP buyout broke.Qualcomm's patent licensing business, which produces the bulk   of the company's profit, has come under pressure in recent years,   as government regulators in China and the EU have accused the   company of charging excessive royalty rates to mobile-device   makers. This trend seems to have accelerated in recent months, as   regulators in South Korea and the U.S. FTC have also sued   Qualcomm over charges of anticompetitive business practices.   Adding insult to injury, Qualcomm customer Apple sued the   company in January over its patent licensing practices.Qualcomm plans to defend itself to the hilt and has presented   compelling counterarguments to some of the accusations. However,   given the weight of its current legal entanglements, Qualcomm   seems risky as an investment, even despite the long-term benefit   the NXP Semiconductor buyout is likely to add.10 stocks we like better than Skyworks SolutionsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Warren Buffett’s Market Indicator Reaches 130%;2/17/2017;"On Feb. 17, 2017, the U.S.total market cap / gross domestic productratio reached 130%, a critical milestone as valuations remain significantly overvalued. Most ofWarren Buffett(Trades,Portfolio)'s portfolio holdings as of Dec. 31, 2016, have price-sales valuations greater than the 80th percentile of the industry. Such companies includeThe Coca-Cola Co.(KO),International Business Machines Corp.(IBM),Delta Air Lines Inc.(DAL),Apple Inc.(AAPL) andSouthwest Airlines Co.(LUV).Buffett indicator reaches critical milestoneBuffett pointed out that the ratio of the Wilshire 5000 full-cap index over the gross domestic product is ""probably the best single measure of where valuations stand at any given moment."" The total market index is currently $24513.4 billion, about 130% of the last reported U.S. GDP. Such market valuations seldom appeared since the dot-com bubble of 2000, when the Buffett indicator reached nearly 150%. Figure 1 shows the historical trendline of the Buffett indicator since 1970.makeArticleAd();Figure 1: The Ratio of Wilshire 5000 to GDP as of Feb. 17As illustrated in Figure 2, the ""predicted and actual stock market returns"" graphs the expected annual returns for three different scenarios: the optimistic case (red trendline), the pessimistic case (green trendline) and the median case (blue trendline). For the optimistic case, which is based on a TMC/GDP ratio of about 120%, the expected annualized market return is approximately 4.2%. Likewise, the pessimistic case, which is based on a TMC/GDP ratio of about 40%, gives an expected annualized market return of -8.5%. Based on a median TMC/GDP ratio of about 80%, the expected annualized market return is currently -0.7%.Figure 2: The Predicted and Actual Stock Market Returns as of Feb. 17Stocks reach high price-sales ratios relative to industry mediansWhile the Buffett indicator determines the valuation of the entire U.S. stock market, we can analyze the price-sales ratio of the individual companies to identify which companies are significantly overvalued compared to others. Unlike the price-earnings ratio, which works poorly for cyclical companies, the price-sales ratio more accurately compares historical valuations with current valuations as profit margins revert to the mean approximately every eight years. Figure 3 shows the number of S&P 500 companies with high price-sales ratios relative to the industry median. The figure also shows how many of Buffett's stock holdings have high price-sales ratios.Figure 3Before we discuss the price-sales valuations for the individual companies, we will first consider Buffett's major stock positions as of Dec. 31, 2016. TheBerkshire Hathaway Inc.(NYSE:BRK.A)(NYSE:BRK.B) CEO continued expanding his airline empire during fourth-quarter 2016, adding a new position in Southwest and increasing his Delta position nearly tenfold. As illustrated in Figure 4, Buffett also more than tripled his stake in Apple, adding over 42.1 billion shares at an average share price of $113.40.Figure 4: Buffett's Trade History for AppleUnfortunately for investors, the industrials and technology sectors are significantly overvalued compared to other sectors. Companies in these two sectors represent 28% of all NYSE and Nasdaq companies whose P/S is greater than the 70th percentile of the industry, and 27% of the companies with a P/S greater than the 80th percentile of the industry. The respective values increase to 37% and 39% when we consider just the S&P 500 companies. Figures 5.1 and 5.2 show the sector breakdown for NYSE and Nasdaq companies, while Figures 6.1 and 6.2 show the sector breakdown for S&P 500 companies.Figure 5.1Figure 5.2Figure 6.1Figure 6.2Industrials and technology companies have above-average price-sales valuationsTo determine which companies are significantly overvalued based on their price-sales ratio, we can look at the company's price-sales valuation chart and / or the median price-sales valuation line. The latter is similar to the Peter Lynch earnings line, except we compare the company's stock price to the trailing 12-month revenue per share multiplied by the 10-year median price-sales ratio. Figure 7.1 shows Apple's price-sales valuation chart and median price-sales valuation line for the past 5 years.Figure 7.1: Five-year Price-Sales Valuation Chart for AppleAs illustrated in Figure 7.1, Apple trades approximately $15 higher than its median price-sales valuation. The company has five medium warning signs, including a price near a 10-year high and a price-sales ratio near a 12-month high.We can see a similar pattern with the price-sales valuation charts for Buffett's major positions as illustrated in Figures 7.2 to 7.5.Figure 7.2: 10-yearPrice-Sales Valuation Chart for CokeFigure 7.3: 10-year Price-Sales Valuation Chart for IBMFigure 7.4: 10-year Price-Sales Valuation Chart for DeltaFigure 7.5:10-year Price-Sales Valuation Chart for SouthwestFigure 7.6 shows Southwest's Peter Lynch chart.Figure 7.6: 10-year Peter Lynch Chart for SouthwestAlthough Southwest traded below its Peter Lynch earnings line from mid-2015 to late 2016, the Dallas-based low-cost airline converged to its maximum price-sales valuation during the second half of 2016 as crudeoil pricesincreased approximately $20 per barrel. Figure 8 illustrates Southwest's share price compared to thecrude oil pricesfor the past three years.Figure 8Conclusions and see alsoAs the stock market valuations continue to increase, gurus are generally selling shares in S&P 500 companies.

Apple Inc. (AAPL) Is Overdue for a Pullback, But Upside Remains Great;2/17/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsApple, Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) is a stock I've been bullish on for a long time, and my outlook hasn't changed in either the short or long term. AAPL stock has been incredibly strong recently (as has the overall market) and a healthy pullback in the next week or two is certainly a possibility.makeArticleAd();Apple stock gained 10% through all of 2016, and in just the seven weeks so far in 2017 it is already up nearly 17%. In addition, the relative strength index (RSI, located at the bottom of the chart below) is up to 93, which is the highest it's been in a year. Of course, a stock can continue to rally even with an elevated RSI, but there's no question the odds of a pullback are becoming higher.Apple has initial support at the old all-time high of $134.54, but given AAPL stock's recent climb, it's more realistic to expect a slightly larger dip. That would put the next level of support at the upper end of the large gap AAPL left after earnings in early February. If it gets anywhere close to that $127 area, which would represent a healthy 6% pullback from current prices, it would be considered a great buying opportunity.Bottom Line on Apple StockFrom a fundamental perspective, Apple remains the largest company in the world, but it is also very undervalued right now. AAPL stock currently trades with a forward P/E of approximately 15, which is below the 17.5 P/E the S&P 500 garners today.3 Cheap Lithium Stocks to Buy That Will Energize Your PortfolioAlso, keep in mind that the company should grow earnings at least as quickly as the index. Adding in Apple's intangibles and the cult-like following it continues to have around the world, there's no question it should have a valuation above that of the market. If AAPL stock were to trade at the S&P's valuation of 17.5x 2017 EPS estimates, share prices would be up around $156.27.Looking ahead, I believe Apple will report much better 2017 earnings than Wall Street expects, and I think $175 is a more reasonable price target over the next 12 months. That's a long way up from the price of Apple stock today, so I'd be looking to build a position on a healthy pullback.Matthew McCall is founder and president of Penn Financial Group, an investment advisory firm.

Why 42% Of Schwab Investors Are On The Prowl For Stocks;2/17/2017;"Investors know what they like, and they liked the November   election results and December's interest-rate increase by the   Federal Reserve.Those events prompted a jump in investors who have retail   accounts withCharles Schwab(SCHW) to declare themselves bullish. In a fourth-quarter survey of   those investors, Schwab found 42% of them said they now feel   bullish. That was a big jump up from the 34% who felt that way in   Q4 a year earlier.""As a result of the election, clients saw an increased   prospect for a reduction in personal and corporate tax rates, an   increased likelihood of spending on infrastructure, and an   increased likelihood of a reduction in regulatory burdens for   some industries,"" said Myhanh Hoskin, a Schwab financial   consultant, who is based in Seal Beach, Calif. ""The rate increase   was a sign of growing strength in the economy.""makeArticleAd();Amid that widespread perception that the stock market had   become increasingly worth investing in, Schwab investors did as   much buying as selling in the quarter.The top five U.S. holdings among all Schwab stock mutual funds   wereApple(AAPL),Microsoft(MSFT),Exxon Mobil(XOM),Johnson & Johnson(JNJ) andJPMorgan Chase(JPM) as of Feb. 16, according to Morningstar Inc.Apple is up 17% year to date, while Microsoft is up 4%, Exxon   is down 10%, Johnson & Johnson is up 3%, and JPMorgan is up   5%.In Schwab's survey of its clients, the general balance between   buying and selling bodes well for the market in additional ways.   ""It shows there isn't a sense of euphoria,"" Hoskin said. ""It   shows caution by many investors. And that suggests that we're not   seeing a market top. That is a good thing. When you have too many   people doing the same thing, that tends to be a contrarian   indicator.""On the other hand, only 13% of investors said their top   concern about the market is that it appears overdue for a   correction, suggesting a tone of overconfidence.In contrast, a whopping 88% said they are confident about   reaching their financial goals.Allocations And OutlookInvestors had 41.3% of their money in stocks, 21.1% in cash,   18.8% in mutual funds, 11.9% in exchange traded funds, and 6.9%   in fixed income.And 21% of those investors said they planned to move more   money into stocks during the current first quarter.Stocks were the most popular planned destination for   additional allocations.ETFs were the second most popular target asset, with 17% of   investors saying that's where they planned to put more money.Mutual funds were the third most popular, with 15% of   investors saying they would move money into them in Q1.Investors were more inclined to get help in making investment   decisions.

Cognex Corporation Earnings Start 2017 on a Strong Note;2/17/2017;"Investors inCognex Corporation(NASDAQ: CGNX) are getting used to their company blasting past   its own guidance, and the recent results proved no exception. The   solid set of fourth-quarter earnings capped off a very good year   for the company, and management served notice that 2017 could be   even stronger. Let's take a look at the details and commentary   from the earnings presentation.Cognex Corporation fourth-quarter results: The raw   numbersStarting with the headline figures from the fourth   quarter:Revenue of $129 million came in significantly above the     guidance range of $115 million to $118 million.Gross margin of 79% came in at the high end of the guidance     range of mid-to-high 70%.Operating margin expanded to 31% from 20% in the same     quarter last year.Diluted net income from continuing operations increased to     $0.43 from $0.22 in last year's fourth quarter.In short, a combination of strong revenue growth and what CEO   Robert Willett called ""the substantial leverage that incremental   revenue has on our business model"" led to a strong increase in   profits. In a nutshell, Willett simply means that revenue   increases tend to lead to even greater earnings growth.makeArticleAd();As such, the guidance for the first quarter is encouraging. As   a reminder, Cognex doesn't tend to give guidance more than one   quarter ahead.First-quarter revenue guidance range of $122 million to     $125 million, representing growth of 27% to 30%.Gross margin in the mid-to-high 70% range.Operating expenses to increase 10% on a sequential     basis.Management expects an effective tax rate of 18%.The guidance is impressive and reflective of the strength of   Cognex's order book. However, the second and third quarters are   usually the strongest for the company -- largely because   customers are preparing for their key fourth quarters during   those six months -- and the lack of specific guidance for that   period means it's too early to definitively conclude Cognex will   have another stellar year.Image source: Cognex.Core areas growingThat said, the indications from the earnings call are positive   for three reasons. First, Willet spoke of ""better-than-expected   demand across a range of industries including automotives,   consumer electronics, and logistics."" For reference, the   automotive industry is Cognex's historical core industry, and   consumer electronics and logistics are the key growth areas for   the company.According to Willett, around 30% of 2016 revenue came from   consumer electronics, with a similar figure from automotive,   while logistics and consumer products contributed a ""little less   than 10%"" apiece.U.S. improvingSecond, it looks like Cognex is starting to see some   improvement in its factory automation revenue in America, an area   of weakness in the last couple of years. Willett spoke of   mid-teens revenue growth in factory automation in the Americas in   the fourth quarter. Moreover, it came from a range of industries,   and Willett confirmed ""that improvement has continued into   January,"" and he sees continued improvement in 2017.Not just about AppleThird, Cognex's largest customer isApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) , but the machine-vision company is no one-trick   pony. It's difficult for management to disclose too much about   its relationship with Apple, but according to Willett's comments   on the earnings call, the strength in the quarter wasn't down to   just one customer.For reference, the large Apple deal involves sales booked in   Europe for business to China. In this regard, Willett referred to   Europe having ""a terrific quarter in Q4, independent of consumer   electronics business to China. It grew more than 30%   year-on-year,"" with mention of strong performances in automotive   and logistics.Image source: Cognex.Looking aheadAll told, it was another strong quarter for Cognex, and the   company looks well-positioned for 2017. That said, look out for   guidance in the next quarter in order to see if some of the deals   the company has been working on are likely to close or not.   According to management, the environment remains favorable, and   investors will be hoping Cognex can continue to exceed   expectations.10 stocks we like better than CognexWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Apple Inc. (AAPL) May Have Different View On Trump’s iPhone Manufacturing Plans;2/17/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsApple Inc.(AAPL) does not mind making Trump furious.makeArticleAd();The U.S. President has been targeting Apple's low-energy and economically-sensible overseasmanufacturingsince the beginning. Even though the iPhone maker has so far stayed away from this debate, recent comments from CFO Luca Maestri suggest that the U.S. firm has no plans of closing up shop in China any time soon, according toBGR.In response to a question about overseas manufacturing at a Goldman Sachs conference, Maestri said, ""One of the points that we are making in Washington is the fact that we have been a very large contributor to the US economy during the last decade. We made billions ofinvestmentsin the United States. In the last 10 years, we created about 2 million jobs in this country - in the developer community in our retail stores in our call centers and through the supplier chain.""Maestri then talked about Apple's U.S.-located call centers, adding that speculating on Apple's manufacturing plans is really difficult, especially when Trump hasn't outlined any specific policies.He did note that imposition of a border tax on imported products would lead to an additional burden on the end consumer.This could also mean that Apple is making yet another attempt to take iPhone manufacturing off the table for discussions with Trump. It seems that the iPhone maker does not mind taking back ancillary services, such as support centers, back to the US, but it doesn't want to move the entire iPhone supply chain, notes BGR.Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock Could Win Big With 'Windows Cloud'Apple's iPhone manufacturing has been in the news for quite some time now.Reportedly, Apple asked its subsidiaries to examine the feasibility of iPhone manufacturing soon after Trump's electoral victory.

WWDC 2017: Here’s What Apple Inc. Might Reveal;2/17/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) has announced the date for its yearly developer conference. WWDC 2017 will take place in San Jose, starting on June 5. What can you expect the company to announce at the Apple event?makeArticleAd();Source: AppleAs a developer conference, Apple usually focuses on software at its June events and WWDC 2017 will follow the same pattern.The company likes to offer hints at what its upcoming operating system releases hold with demos during the keynote presentation.With the iPhone dominating Apple's bottom line, iOS 11 - the next version of AAPL's mobile operating system - is bound to get the majority of the stage time.Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT) Stock Isn't Coming Back. Just Ask Buffett.You can expect to see the latest versions of Apple's other operating systems to be shown off as well. We'll find out which California geographical feature macOS 10.13 will be named after, along with the latest new features for Mac users. Apple Watch's watchOS and the Apple TV's tvOS will also get mentions.WWDC 2017: What About the Hardware?Software is exciting to app developers. For everyone else, maybe not so much, especially when it's just a teaser or dives into technical details. What really gets people's attention - especially from an Apple event - is new hardware. AAPL doesn't put an emphasis on revealing new products on stage at these developer conferences, but there have been exceptions, including:Mac Pro at WWDC 2006iPhone 3G at WWDC 200813-inch MacBook Pro and iPhone 3GS at WWDC 2009iPhone 4 at WWDC 2010MacBook Pro with Retina Display WWDC 2012New Mac Pro at WWDC 2013Historically speaking, we may be overdue for a hardware announcement and there are two possibilities that come into mind for WWDC 2017.WWDC 2017: iPhone 8?It's been many years since AAPL chose its summer Apple event to take the wraps off a new iPhone. It's a long shot, but there's a possibility the company may choose WWDC 2017 to unveil the iPhone 8. Why?First, there's the significance of the June conference date. 2017 is the 10th anniversary of the iPhone and the very first one first went on sale in June, 2007. Then there are the rumors that Apple is planning toramp up iPhone 8 production in June, which would be earlier than usual.But the most compelling reason why the company might show off the iPhone 8 early is the developers in attendance. We're pretty sure AAPL is going to make sweeping changes to the iPhone 8. Besides design changes, that could mean anything from an optical scanner to a mini version of the new MacBook Pro's Touch Bar replacing the Home button.The company will want apps available at launch that make use of any new hardware and that means bringing developers into the loop early. Apple may decide to let the cat out of the bag at WWDC 2017 so developers have a chance to learn about the new features and capabilities.7 Stocks Warren Buffett Is Buying or SellingAnother possibility on the hardware front is a revamped Apple TV. AAPL has been struggling with its set-top streamer with sales once again dropping off. It recently hired the former head ofAmazon.com, Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AMZN) Fire TV division tohelp turn around the Apple TV's fortunes. One of the big missing pieces from the Apple TV is relatively easy to fix. A new box with 4K support would address the issue of being stuck in the 1080p era when everyone else is doing Ultra HD, and it's possible Apple could have this ready for June.Of course, we have a few months to wait until we find out for sure. Watch InvestorPlace for coverage of WWDC 2017. Once the keynote wraps up on June 5, we'll be posting on all the major Apple event reveals.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceAmazon.com, Inc.

4 Stocks That Turned $1,000 into $100,000;2/17/2017;"Imagine investing just $1,000 and watching it grow 100 times   over -- or 10,000% -- and suddenly you have a holding worth   $100,000. That's what would have happened if you'd invested in   the companies below in the last few decades. The good news? There   are some similarities flowing through these companies that could   help us spot other potential future 100-baggers.The truth is, there are many stocks that could make this list,   and many have reached it and fallen from grace later in their   life. Here's whyApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) ,Home Depot(NYSE: HD) ,Nike(NYSE: NKE) , andAdobe Systems(NASDAQ: ADBE)  each stand out in the market.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();4 stocks that have grown 100 times overCompanyGained 10,000% or More Since:Year Went PublicTotal Return Over LifeAppleMarch 2009198031.3K%Home DepotSeptember 19971981774.8K%NikeMarch 2003198047K%Adobe SystemsOctober 2002188659.9K%Total return price includes dividends. P/E = Price to   earnings. Data source:YCharts.Apple has been a standout in the market for a lot of reasons,   but one of the biggest is its ability to create incredible   technology, and then also create the eco-system that goes with it   to retain customers and grow its empire ever larger. Going   forward, Apple continues to dominate the smartphone market in the   U.S. and increasingly worldwide, and now, asthe wealthiest company in the U.S. by   far, it looks to have plenty of opportunity for new growth   ahead.Apple is a prime example of how looking for great companies at   times when the overall market sells off could lead to a great   returns long term, which is why Apple has been able to generate   such massive returns since 2009 following the 2008 recession.   Adobe is a similar example, as it gained share price quickly in   the tech boom of the early 2000s but, like many of its early   internet siblings, was slammed by the tech bubble burst of 2001.   Still, if you were an investor then who saw the value of this   company, with industry-leading software that has really evolved   and modernized the graphic media space, you could have made   10,000% by buying in on that 2002 dip.Home Depot is an interesting company because, unlike Apple and   Adobe, it's a relatively low-tech operation that, instead of   changing the world with new innovations, took an old model of   selling construction and home repair equipment and just did that   really well. Home Depot has certainly gone through its own rises   and dips based on market conditions, but rather than having timed   a buy-in to this stock after a market sell-off, Home Depot has   rewarded long-term investors who have stuck with it over the last   20 years.Nike has a lot of similarities to Home Depot in that it wasn't   the first to introduce innovative new footwear models to the   world, but founder Phil Knight and his early team certainly   out-hustled many of its competitors to grow Nike into the   international sporting behemoth it is today. Nike has also been a   success story of international expansion -- international sales   now make up around half of its total sales -- and how a smart   international strategy can lead to exponential growth.Looking for the next 100-baggerIt's impossible to know which stocks are going to become these   kinds of serious market-beating holdings in the decades to come.   Still, there are a few key themes that can help in your search --   the most important of which is to buy quality companies with   great competitive moats and strong management teams. The other   key takeaway is the importance of having a buy-and-hold   strategy over 5, 10, or even 20 years out, as seen in Home   Depot's case, which is what allows these quality businesses the   time they need to reward those investors who have stuck with   them.10 stocks we like better than Home DepotWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Apple (AAPL) Becomes Highest Smartphone Seller after 8 Quarters;2/17/2017;"Reportedly, Apple Inc.'s(AAPL)smartphone unit sales outpaced that of Samsung in the fourth quarter of 2016.According to data released by Gartner, Apple unit sales outnumbered Samsung by 256,000. The global smartphone market share of the iPhone maker is 17.9%, just 0.1% higher than Samsung.Apple Inc. PriceApple Inc. Price|Apple Inc. QuoteThe report further adds that the last time Apple recorded the highest unit sales was in the fourth quarter of 2014, riding on the success of iPhone 6 and 6s. This time around, it's probably the dual camera and jet black color of the latest iPhone 7 and 7s that has worked for the company.Apple iPhone sales are likely to rise in the upcoming months given the increasing issues with Samsung phones. The company received a lot of flak for Samsung Galaxy Note 7 and recalled the same from the market, which resulted in depleting sales in the last two quarters. Moreover, the arrest of the company chief, Jay Y. Lee, on Friday, might create more wariness toward the brand. Therefore, consumer skepticism is likely to continue for Samsung, and Apple expects the number of switchers to increase. Additionally, the buzz surrounding iPhone 8, dubbed already as a ""super cycle"" should allay investors' fear about iPhone sales trajectory and help its market performance.In the last few months, Apple has increased its focus on India, which is expected to become the second largest smartphone market in the world. In fiscal 2016, Apple sales in India grew approximately 50% over the prior fiscal. Apple is optimistic about long-term growth prospects in this region.Nonetheless, the smartphone market conditions are highly competitive. Though Apple and Samsung remain the lead players, they are plagued by stiff competition. Notably, a major portion of the market is seized by the growing dominance of Chinese smartphone manufactures like Huwaei, Oppo and others.Going ahead, Apple is also expected to benefit from its robust cash position, strength in technology, the ecosystem that it has built and its loyal customer base. Further, its enterprise collaborations with the likes of Deloitte, IBM Corp.IBM, Cisco and SAP SESAPare expected to be important long-term growth drivers.Moreover, Apple has outperformed the Zacks categorizedComputer Miniindustry in the last one year. While the stock returned 40.47%, the industry gained 39.96% over the same period.Zacks Rank & Stock MovementAt present, Apple has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the wider technology space is Oclaro Inc.OCLR, which carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Apple to Begin Assembling iPhone SE in India from April;2/17/2017;"makeZacksArticleAd();Reportedly,Apple Inc.AAPLin collaboration with its manufacturer, Wistron Inc. will begin to assemble iPhone SE in India starting this April. The plant will be located in the state of Karnataka in south India.Though there is no official word on the matter from Apple or Wistron, it has been reported that initially the Cupertino giant wants to assemble 0.3-0.4 million units of iPhone SE. Apple hasn't even waited for the numerous tax concessions that it sought from the India government including the 15-year customs duty holiday.Analysts observe that it was prudent on part of Apple to begin assembling its most economic iPhone offering, SE, which was launched to cater to cost sensitive markets like India. Plus, it also will support future iOS upgrades unlike iPhone 5S, which will soon be discontinued in most of the markets including India.Apple Inc. PriceApple Inc. Price|Apple Inc. QuoteWhy is Apple Keen on India?Since the last year, Apple has been increasing its focus on India to claim a greater share of the vast smartphone market, of which it reportedly holds only 2% as of now. Apple faces slowing iPhone demand in most of the regions, either because of competition or regulatory hurdles (China) or market saturation (the U.S). Therefore, it makes sense for the company to solidify its position in India, which is projected to become the second largest smartphone market in the world. In fiscal 2016, Apple sales in India grew approximately 50% over the prior fiscal.Furthermore, a younger (and skilled) population and increasing investment in broadband network by the government also make India an attractive growth opportunity for Apple over the long run. In fact, the government under PM Narendra Modi is eager to bring foreign capital and boost manufacturing facilities in India.The recently outlined FDI policy also bodes well for the company as it eliminates the requirement to locally source products for at least a three-year period. This will enable Apple to open its solely-owned retails stores in India. Thereafter, the company will have to comply with the rule. The company has also partnered with telecom company Reliance, which is providing its Jio (a unique all-IP network) service for free with the new iPhones.Last year, Tim Cook was on a charm offensive in India. Besides meeting Modi, he also announced the opening of an iOS App Design and Development Accelerator in Bengaluru and a map development office in another southern Indian city, Hyderabad in collaboration with regional firm RMSI.ChallengesThe market is highly cost sensitive. Reportedly, majority of the smartphones sold are priced around INR 10K (roughly $145). iPhone 7 on the other hand costs almost five times more. Even iPhone SE is priced at INR 30K. The lion's share of Apple's revenues in the country comes from devices, which are a couple of generations old. Newer models have relatively low demand given the hefty price tag.  A few days back, it was reported that the Apple team in India is trying to increase revenues to $3 billion by 2017-18 and by local assembling operations, the company can start to operate its own retail outlets and avail a 10% tax benefit. This should lower prices.Plus, Apple's rival Samsung along with a few Chinese smartphone makers dominates this market. Samsung has long been in the market and with reportedly 23% share, it is a leading player in the country. Apple is quite late to the party.Also, Apple's lack of focus on regional customers' demand is a concern. India is categorized by handsets that work on dual SIMs. Apparently, Apple is not keen on making dual SIM handsets. This could be a very big impediment to growth in the country.Also, analysts observe that Apple is ""relocating"" manufacturing to India from China, given rising labor costs. However another analyst argues that though labor is cheap compared with China, productivity is relatively better in China. Simple assembling may not drastically bring down prices. However, the creation of a local supply chain as in China will be a big positive.Despite the pros and cons, Apple is expected to continue its India drive. It will be taking up a lot more initiatives this year. However, whether those initiatives yield desirable results remains a watch and see story.Apple, of course, is not the only tech player eyeing India for growth. Given the potential of this market, Silicon Valley's interest is well understood. From Microsoft Corp.MSFTto AlphabetGOOGLto Facebook Inc.FBall remain laser focused on the market.Zacks Rank & Price MovementAt present, Apple has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

7 Surprising Metrics Highlight 1 Major Catalyst for Apple, Inc. Stock: Services;2/16/2017;"With the iPhone providing 64% of trailing 12-month revenue atApple Inc.(NASDAQ: AAPL) , the tech giant's business is still primarily   driven by that segment. But it doesn't mean investors should   overlook Apple's other business segments. One is standing out   more than ever: the company's App Store, iTunes, Apple Music,   iCloud, Apple Pay, licensing, and other services.Apple's App Store drives the majority of services revenue.     Image source: Apple.makeArticleAd();1. $7.2 billion:In Apple's most recent quarter, quarterly services revenue hit an   all-time high of $7.2 billion -- up 18% year over year, handily   exceeding Apple's overall revenue growth of 3% and beating growth   in any other segment.But even this growth in Apple's services segment understates   how rapidly services revenue is growing. Apple CFO Luca Maestri   explained the discrepancy between reported growth and actual   segment growth in the company's first-quarter earnings call:Our run rate growth was actually higher when taking into     account two discrete items. On one hand, the 14th week added to     Services revenue this December quarter. On the other hand, that     benefit was more than offset by the comparison to the one-off     $548 million patent infringement payment included in Services     revenue a year ago.2. 9.2%:Apple's services segment is growing as a proportion of total   revenue. In the company's most recent quarter, services accounted   for 9.2% of total revenue, up from 8% in the year-ago quarter and   6.4% in the same quarter two years ago.3. 43%:Adjusting for the extra week in Apple's first quarter this year,   App Store revenue soared 43% year over year, shattering all   previous records. This was driven by growth both in average   revenue per paying account and in the total number of paying   accounts.As Maestri was sure to mention, Apple's App Store revenue   growth outpaced the overall app industry, and more than doubled   2016 revenue fromAlphabet's Google Play store.Going forward, Maestri believes ""the App Store is going to be   a significant driver of growth.""4. $3 billion:If you had any doubts about the importance of the App Store to   Apple's services segment, wonder no longer: It's critical. Apple   said fiscal first-quarter App Store revenue was $3 billion in   December alone.5. $60 billion:Based on the trajectory of developer revenue in 2016, the   business of apps is just getting started. Apple's developer   community has now raked in $60 billion in earnings, garnering   over $20 billion just in 2016.6. Over 150 million subscriptions:Between Apple's own subscription services and third-party content   subscriptions offered through the App Store, the company has more   than 150 million paid customer subscriptions.Apple Music. Image source: Apple.7. $51 billion:What kind of growth should investors expect from Apple's services   segment? The business could double over the next four years,   according to Apple management. This would bring annual services   revenue to a staggering $51 billion in 2020.While these figures alone make a great case for investors to   pay close attention to Apple's services segment, the very nature   of Apple's services themselves justify the segment's importance.   Unlike the unpredictable nature of focused product revenue from   iPhone, Mac, and iPad, services revenue is more sustainable,   stable, and predictable. Further, it's a solid measure of the   degree to which a growing number of customers are becoming   increasingly invested in Apple's powerful ecosystem of hardware,   software, and services.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

You'll Never Guess Where People Use Apple Pay the Most;2/16/2017;"Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) recently said some 4 million locations, or about   35% of all retail stores in the U.S., accept its Apple   Pay mobile payment option. Although there are some notable   exceptions among the largest retailers, such asWal-MartandTarget, who don't offer it, others likeGapdo, or soon will feature the payment solution.Because it's available on mobile phones, tablets, and even the   Apple Watch, its ubiquity and relative ease of use make it the   go-to choice for consumers on the go as well as those   dissatisfied with the hassle and delays of embedded chip   cards. According to data analytics firm TXN Solutions, which   surveyed the transactions from over 3 million payment   cards, Apple Pay usage has soared by 50% over the past   year.Image source: Apple.makeArticleAd();The rise of Apple PayIndeed, during Apple's first-quarter earnings conference call   with analysts last month, CEO Tim Cook said transaction volume   had risen sixfold from the prior year as Apple Pay expanded into   four new countries, including Japan, Russia, New Zealand, and   Spain.While that would seem to clash somewhat with TXN's more muted   (though still significant) rise, it comes down to a difference in   what's being measured. While Apple isn't particularly   forthcoming on details of the Apple Pay ecosystem, it is talking   about the actual number of transactions made, while the data   analytics firm is referencing the percentage of transactions from   its panel of consumers who provide their credit and debit card   data and whose banks distinguish Apple Pay transactions.While that naturally limits the universe of transactions   captured, over time it still tracks the acceptance of the mobile   payment option and its growth, and what it found was that   most people were using it in mobile apps and on   websites.A place to crash for the nightThat surprising conclusion was reached after finding that of   all the places Apple Pay users were using the payment   option, getting a cheap hotel room at the last minute topped the   list. Ordering takeout was apparently the second favorite way to   use the service.Image source: HotelTonight.The TXN data, which examined payments made between December   2015 and December 2016, found mobile travel app HotelTonight, a   last-minute reservation service, had 3.4% of all its   credit cards transactions made with Apple Pay, followed   by food delivery services Caviar, Postmates, and DoorDash,   which all had around 2.5% usage rates or slightly higher.What is more notable about the survey results is that despite   the broad proliferation of places accepting Apple Pay as an   option, it really hasn't caught on among brick-and-mortar   retailers, where most places saw it represent less than 1% of all   credit card transactions. And ultimately, regardless of   where it is used, it isn't creating much of a stir in the   payments industry, as it represents just a small percentage   of total credit card transactions.But let's first cross off the names of stores where peoplearen'tusing Apple Pay.Starbucks' mobile ordering trumps Apple payAt the bottom of the list isStarbucks(NASDAQ: SBUX) , which came in last on a list of the 13   top places processing Apple Pay transactions, accounting for   about 0.5% of the coffee shop's total credit card   transactions. Considering Starbucks has its own highly   regarded mobile ordering and payment option, which is often   looked at as the gold standard for convenience and ease of use,   it raises eyebrows that people are using Apple Pay there at   all.On its first-quarter earnings conference call with analysts   two weeks ago, Starbucks President Kevin Johnson said, ""Mobile   Order & Pay had a banner quarter, representing more than 7%   of total transactions, double the figure from Q1 last year, and   we now have nearly 1,200 stores with 20% or more Mobile Order   & Pay transactions at peak, compared to only 13 stores one   year ago."" When you have customer loyalty like that, who   needs Apple Pay?Image source: Starbucks.Food retailers still represent the lion's share of places   seeing Apple Pay usage, and Lowes Foods,Sprouts Farmers Markets,Panera Bread, and Schnucks round out the bottom five places for users of the   mobile wallet, with around 0.6% of their credit card transactions   accounted for using the payment method.A prescription for future growth?So, if Starbucks and trendy grocery stores were bringing up   the rear, who was it that was leading the brick-and-mortar pack?   Would you believe Duane Reade, the New York metropolitan   area drugstore chain owned byWalgreens Boots Alliance(NASDAQ: WBA) ?According to the TXN data, the pharmacy operator was the top   spot where people used Apple Pay, with 1.8% of the credit card   transactions identifying the mobile payment option being chosen.   That put it slightly ahead of No. 2 retailerWhole Foods Market(Nasdaq: WFM), which had about 1.7% of its credit card   transactions using Apple Pay.Because both retailers have been with the service since Apple   launched Apple Pay in 2014, it might not be so surprising they   were well ahead of the others, including Canteen Vending at No. 3   with slightly less than 1% of its transactions, and fourth place   Peet's Coffee with just under 0.8%.Whether that means Apple Pay will ever supplant EMV cards as a   preferred payment option remains to be seen, but it seems hard to   believe it will replace Starbucks' mobile order and pay app   anytime soon. And though Apple Pay users seem to be a rare breed   indeed, maybe all you need to see them in action is to   simply stop by your local pharmacy.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Top Stocks Warren Buffett Is Buying Now;2/16/2017;"Warren Buffett is arguably the best investor on the planet,   and his penchant for picking winners for long-haul portfolios   makes it worth paying attention to the stocks he's buying for hisBerkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK-A) (NYSE: BRK-B) . Fortunately, big investors like   Buffett are required to file a 13F report with the SEC every   quarter that show what they've been up to.In Buffett's case, he's been busy buyingApple Inc.(NASDAQ: AAPL) ,Delta Air Lines(NYSE: DAL) , andMonsanto(NYSE: MON) . Should you buy these stocks too?A big win that's getting biggerBack in 2012, Warren Buffett told investors that Steve Jobs   called him a few years prior with questions on how best to spend   Apple's cash war chest. Buffett told Jobs to buyback Apple's   stock, but Jobs didn't.makeArticleAd();IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.It took a while, and a sell-off, but Warren Buffett has   finally followed his own advice and taken a big (and growing)   stake in Apple for Berkshire Hathaway.Apple shares showed up in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio last   year, and at the time, Buffett said the shares had been bought by   one of his lieutenants. Maybe so, but Berkshire's position in   Apple has grown steadily since then, and now it's Berkshire   Hathaway's sixth largest holding, by value.So far, buying Apple shares has proven savvy. In the wake of   worry over slowing iPhone sales, shares hit a low of $90 last   May. Today, they're at $135.It's anyone's guess how long Apple will remain in Berkshire   Hathaway's portfolio, or if Berkshire Hathaway will buy more   shares this year, but there are reasons why investors might want   to look for a chance to pick up shares in the company,   too. Apple iPhone sales bounced back to growth last quarter,   and management's plans to double services sales by 2020 could   provide a lot of margin-friendly support to Apple's bottom   line.Investors may also benefit from any tax reform that allows the   company to repatriate some of the $200 million-plus in cash it   holds overseas. And investors should probably expect that Apple's   dividend payment is going higher, not lower, in the coming years.   Currently, shares yield 1.7%.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Taking flightOne of the most surprising stocks that Warren Buffett has   bought in the past year is airline stocks, including Delta Air   Lines, Inc. In the past, Buffett has called airline stocks   terrible investments, but he appears to have changed his mind --   in a very big way.In the third quarter, Berkshire Hathaway acquired roughly $1   billion worth of American Airlines, Delta Air, and United   Continental stock. After the news of those purchases broke,   Buffett told CNBC that he had picked up shares in Southwest,   too.The scattershot approach to airlines could mean that Buffett's   bet is less stock specific and more driven by the potential for   travel to pick up alongside economic growth. With unemployment   low, wages beginning to climb more quickly, and corporate   friendly tax reform on deck in Washington, D.C., there's reason   to think that the travel industry could benefit from rising   demand.If so, then Warren Buffett's decision to bulk up his position   in airlines stocks in the fourth quarter could be smart. In the   quarter, Berkshire Hathaway's stake in Delta Air Lines   sky-rocketed 847%. That 60 million-plus share stake in Delta Air   Lines is worth more than $3 billion, which makes it Berkshire   Hathaway's biggest airline investment.Delta Air Lines has said it wants to return 70% of its annual   free cash flow to investors. Considering the company's recent   history of big dividend increases and the fact that share   buybacks are wrapping up soon, investors might be getting some   good news from management in the near future. The company has   increased its dividend payout by 237.5% since 2013, including a   50% increase last May. Given that Delta's payout ratio is only   15.9%, it wouldn't be a surprise if another large dividend   increase comes again this year.Couple the potential rewards of a rising dividend with the   potential for growing travel demand to support airfares and load   factor, and maybe airlines aren't as terrible of an investment as   they used to be.Getting in on grainsWarren Buffett is also betting that Bayer's planned megamerger   with grains giant Monsanto passes muster with regulators.   Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio includes 8 million shares of   Monsanto as of Dec. 31.As a refresher, Bayer inked a deal to buy Monsanto last year   for $128 per share in cash. However, this merger would create a   global giant in seeds and crop protection, and that may create a   lot of obstacles to overcome if the two hope to get government   approvals. According to number crunchers atBloomberg, the odds of this deal closing were about 40% on Valentine's   Day.Those odds could understate the likelihood of this happening,   however, given that the mood in Washington, D.C. has become far   less anti-business since November's election. In January, Bayer   and Monsanto executives may have helped their cause by offering   promises to boost jobs and spend $8 billion in the U.S. if the   deal closes.If the deal goes through, then the all-cash nature of this   acquisition could make Monsanto's stock worth owning in   portfolios. Monsanto's currently trading at around $109, which is   a 17% discount to the offer price.Even if the deal doesn't close, Monsanto won't walk away   completely empty-handed. Bayer's on the hook to pay Monsanto a $2   billion break-up fee if the merger falls through. Even so, this   one isn't your typical buy-and-hold Warren Buffett buy, so   investors might be better off looking elsewhere.10 stocks we like better than MonsantoWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

How Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Can Deliver More Free Profits;2/16/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsI have had a good run of trades withFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB), typically because I go long into swoons. Instead of tying up sizable capital owning Facebook stock, I use the options markets to capture the upside opportunities.makeArticleAd();Source:Via FacebookYes, options can be dangerous, but just like any type of investing, without risk there is no return.Fundamentally,FB stock should do well in the long term. Management has proven that it can execute on its plans and adjust them when necessary. It had a few missteps in the beginning but has since been on rails.9 Top Pharmaceutical Stocks to Buy for the DividendsThe company boasts more than a billion users in an exciting arena, so Facebook stock should sustain a rosy long-term outlook.How to Trade Facebook Stock Right NowThe Trade - Bullish Facebook:Sell Dec $95 puts for $1.75 per contract. So for 10 contracts, $1,750 goes into my account. But the money is not mine until the trade expires worthless for maximum gains or until I close the position. From current FB prices, this trade has a 90% theoretical chance of success with a 28% buffer from current price.It sounds like free money, and it is as long as Facebook stock stays above my strike sold. If FB falls below my strike, I would be put the stock at that price. If that happens, anything below $93.25 per share would accrue losses for me.Personally, I don't mind owning Facebook stock at a 28% discount from here.By selling the puts, I committed to buying the stock in the event that the Facebook stock price falls below my strike. In essence, I'm selling someone a lottery ticket. They hope FB would fall more than 28% so they can start profiting. My plan is that Facebook stays on track through 2017.I could spend 10 cents buying sacrifice Jun $90 puts to guard against a market crash to help me sleep better for the next few months.Facebook Inc (FB) Is Losing the War Against Fake NewsI only sell naked puts if I am willing and able to own the stock. So for those who not comfortable committing by selling naked puts, I can change the trade to being a credit put spread instead. This would considerably mitigate the risk.The Alternate - Bullish FB:Sell a Dec $95/$90 credit put spread on FB for 50 cents per contract. The buffer is about the same and yield would still be a respectable 10%. In this case, the maximum risk is defined to the width of the spread less the premium I collect.I am not required to hold my trades through expiration. I can close them at any time for partial gains or losses.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director ofSellSpreads.com.

Fidelity Investments' Revenue And Profit Rose In 2016;2/16/2017;"Known for managing millions of retirement accounts, college   savings plans and regular taxable-investment accounts, Fidelity   Investments on Thursday said 2016 revenue rose 3.4% to $15.9   billion, a record for the privately held company.The combination of revenue growth and slightly lower expenses   produced a record profit of $3.5 billion. That was an increase of   19.5% over 2015's $3 billion in operating income.""All businesses contributed to our strong results,"" a Fidelity   spokesman said.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');The 2016 profit increase reversed a profit decline in   2015, when profit fell $325 million, or 9.8%, from 2014's $3.282   billion.""Fidelity is profitable, strong, innovative and driven to   growth,"" said Jim Lowell, editor-in-chief of Fidelity   Investor, an independent newsletter. ""That's not true for many   financial services companies.""The 2015 profit erosion was caused by spending on staffing and   technology to compete with tough rivals.Operating expenses fell slightly to $12.35 billion in 2016   from $12.4 billion the year before.""The slowdown in expenses is because Fidelity is starting to   see the benefit in Abigail's (Johnson) leadership,"" Lowell said.   One way she has cut spending is by centralizing functions,   eliminating redundancies in information technology and   compliance. ""There's more efficiency,"" Lowell said.Across all of its stock mutual funds, technology was   Fidelity's largest sector as of Jan. 31 with a 20.3%, according   to Morningstar Inc.Fidelity's top U.S. holdings wereApple(AAPL),Facebook(FB),Amazon(AMZN),Alphabet(GOOGL) andMicrosoft(MSFT).Apple's stock has surged 22% since shortly after the election.   It has a so-so 76 Composite Rating from IBD. Facebook has a 90   Comp Rating and is trading near its all-time high after breaking   out of a cup-with-handle base in late January. Amazon has risen   12% this year, has a 76 Comp Rating, and has formed a   cup-with-handle base with a buy point of 843.94. Alphabet's Comp   Rating is 69. Microsoft has a weak 60 Comp Rating. It has   uptrended since June.99 is the highest possible Comp Rating, which is on a scale   from 1-99.Fidelity also reported a record $5.7 trillion in investor   assets under administration (AUA), up 10.6% from year-end   2015.Total discretionary and nondiscretionary asset flow for the   year was $218.9 billion, up 15% from 2015 flow.Discretionary flow includes flow to and from managed accounts,   mutual funds, exchange traded funds and collective investment   trusts.Nondiscretionary flow goes to and from investments not managed   by Fidelity, such as other firms' mutual funds and individual   securities.At year-end, Fidelity serviced 27.5 million members of   workplace retirement plans. It serviced another 8.9 million   retail households, plus 8.7 million institutional accounts.Those totals were 6%, 6.8% and 4.1% higher, respectively, than   at year-end 2015.Fidelity mutual fund managers found it harder to beat their   peers in 2016. Fidelity mutual funds beat 58%, 68% and 70% of   their peers for the trailing one-, three- and five-year periods   that ended Dec. 31. They outperformed 72% of their peers in   the one- and three-year periods and 71% of their peers in   the five-year span.Still, the outperformance rate was high. ""To beat 58% of your   peers and have that as a bad year - most fund companies   would kill for that number,"" said newsletter editor   Lowell. ""The falloff reflects the difficult time active   managers had during the six-week Trump (inspired) market run-up.   Odds are they'll be back to outperforming 70% or more in 2017.   That is excellent.""The annual report is a must-read mainly for Fidelity   employees, who control 51% of the voting stock, while the Johnson   family controls the other 49%.Abigail Johnson is chairwoman of parent company   FMR. She succeeded her father, ""Ned"" Edward C. Johnson III, late   last year, shortly before her 55th birthday. Ned Johnson had been   chairman since 1977.Fidelity was founded by Abigail's grandfather, Edward C.   Johnson II, in 1946. His father, Samuel Johnson, worked in the   family dry goods business at the C.F. Hovey department store.Abigail's brother, 52-year-old Edward C. Johnson IV, is   president of Fidelity's Pembroke Real Estate division.Going forward, a key challenge for Fidelity is persuading   customers - especially mutual fund investors - of the   value of active management. ""Broad indices are holding fair or   fully valued stocks (after the long market run-up),"" Lowell said.   ""Active managers can look at which stocks have the best cash   flow, best defensive characteristics, best growth opportunities,   rather than buying bundles of high-priced stocks passively.""Behind The 2016 ImprovementFormally, the annual report is for Fidelity Financial   Services, which consists of Fidelity Investments and the other   financial services lines of parent company FMR. It excludes FMR's   nonfinancial businesses such as its hotel and real estate   operations.Fidelity has lagged rival Vanguard in attracting net new money   from shareholders.In 2016, Fidelity saw the second-largest net outflow from   mutual funds, as shareholders hit the firm with $24.5 billion in   net redemptions, according to Morningstar Inc. That left Fidelity   with $1.2 trillion in mutual fund total net assets. That asset   count reflects open-end mutual funds and excludes money market   funds and funds of funds.Fidelity's mutual fund outflow was exceeded only by Franklin   Templeton Investments' $43.2 billion in net outflow. Franklin   Templeton had $378.7 billion in total net assets.Net inflow to passively run Fidelity funds - mainly exchange   traded funds - reduced its combined mutual-fund-and-ETF net   outflow by about $1 billion.Whether it was flow just to mutual funds or to funds plus   ETFs, shareholders largely had low costs on their minds. That   made index mutual funds and ETFs popular destinations for net   inflow. ""By far, 2016 belonged to Vanguard,"" Morningstar editor   Tom Lauricella and senior analyst Alina Lamy noted in a recent   report. ""The low-cost juggernaut dominated the flows landscape to   a remarkable degree.""Vanguard drew net inflow to its mutual funds that vastly   outpaced its rival firms'. Vanguard lured in a net $182.997   billion to its mutual funds.All other mutual fund complexes with inflow - there were 314   if them - had combined net inflow of $151 billion.Vanguard also attracted $94.26 billion in net inflow to its   ETFs.Still, Fidelity had bright spots. Investors poured $37.2   billion in net inflow into passively run Fidelity mutual funds   and ETFs. The trouble was that investors yanked a net $60.5   billion from Fidelity's actively run funds and ETFs.And three Fidelity portfolios were among the 12 top stock   mutual funds of 2016 in terms of gathering net inflow. Now-$111.4   billion Fidelity 500 Index Fund (FUSEX) pulled in a net $7.3   billion, fourth best. Sixth best was now-$5 billion Fidelity SAI   U.S. Large Cap Index (FLCPX), which drew in a net $4.4 billion.   And 11th best was now-$4.3 billion Fidelity SAI U.S. Quality   Index (FUQIX), which attracted a net $3.2 billion.Money Market FundsIn addition, a trio of Fidelity money market funds had massive   net inflow, which are not reflected in the Morningstar flow data   for long-term funds.Fidelity Institutional Government (FIGXX) pulled in $74.8   billion in net inflow. Fidelity Government Money Market Fund   (SPAXX) drew a net $37.7 billion. And Fidelity Government Cash   Reserves (FDRXX) pulled in a net $21.3 billion.Industrywide, money market fund inflowwas driven by investor uncertainty. Investors are unsure how markets will respond to President   Trump's policies, actions by the new Congress, the strong dollar,   expected additional interest-rate hikes by the Federal Reserve   and global political events, Tom Roseen, head of research   services for Lipper, told IBD.Another reason for volatile flow into and in some cases out   from money market funds is the new Securities and Exchange   Commission rule requiring certain money market funds to impose   redemption fees and limits to discourage shareholder exits in   time of market stress, Roseen says.The funds with net inflow hold government-issued debt.   Referred to as government money market funds, funds in that group   are generally exempt from the gates-and-fees requirement. In   turn, that makes them popular with investors who do not want   their ability to exit the fund to be limited or subject to   penalty fees.RELATED:Are Fidelity's Recent Stock Buys And Sells     Retirement Account Hot Sauce?Vanguard Net Fund Inflow Dwarfed Its Peers' In     2016Vanguard Drew The Lion's Share Of 2016's Mutual     Fund Net Inflow"

Facebook Inc (FB) Is Losing the War Against Fake News;2/16/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) has begun fighting a war against fake news and, so far at least, it's losing. Failure could have profound implications for Facebook's bottom line, and even threaten its ability to remain in business.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');Source: ShutterstockThe threat is deeper than Donald Trump. The power of Facebook's software tools, and communication capabilities, is a two-way street that benefits the darker side of human nature, as well as its better angels.For example, Facebook's Graph Search tool, introduced in 2013, can help you search the site efficiently. It can also help youstalk someone.Facebook Live, which lets users stream live video on the site from their camera phones, can let you show grandparents your kid's birthday party, as it happens. It can also let youshow the child being killed.CEO Mark Zuckerberg promised to do something about this in November, on his own Facebook page, but has not come out with much useful beyond tags on disputed items and a vague statement from an underling thatsharing fake news is your prerogative.FB stock holders need to be worried.Facebook Is a Media Company, Like It or NotFacebook has continually denied it is a media company, subject to responsibility for what it posts, fearing the need in that case for human interventionthat simply would not scale.7 Stocks Warren Buffett Is Buying or SellingThe latest statement from its vice president for partnerships, Dan Rose, is that Facebook is""a new type of platform …where people discovery a lot of media content.""That's about as mealy-mouthed as anything that could come from a corrupt politician.For FB, however, fake news is a global problem, and most countries don't have regulations separating a ""telecommunications service"" from the responsibilities of a ""media outlet."" Thus, Facebook's efforts at self-censorship are showing up first in international markets.The European Commission, for instance, has already warned Facebook, and other networks, thatthey face legal actionif the issue of fake news is not dealt with. AlongsideAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL), Facebook is testing a system calledCrossCheckfor flagging fake news in France, which holds a presidential election this spring.This is being done in cooperation with local media, but the reporting on it shows the difficulty.A Russian storyon the system calls the problem ""so-called fake news"" and calls CrossCheck a plot by the ""mainstream media.""Germany, which holds its own elections this September, is also threatening to imposea 500,000-euro finefor each fake news story it runs.How Bad Can It Get?To see how bad things can get with fake news and the abuse of Facebook Live, Zuckerberg might look at South Sudan, where expatriates are turning a civil conflict into genocide with social media messages or the Dominican Republic, where two journalists were recently killed on Facebook Live as a message from crime gangs.Apple Inc. (AAPL) Careens Closer to Major AR AnnouncementA recent Pew Research study showed 44% of Americans get their news through Facebook, and that most users get news from only one site, meaning Facebook has political and media power commensurate with its financial power.That power: fourth-quarter revenue of $8.8 billion, with $4.27 billion going to net income. FB stock has no debt but nearly $30 billion in cash on the books, supporting a market cap of $385 billion - almost twice that ofWal-Mart Stores Inc.(NYSE:WMT).All this is severely threatened if Facebook can't get its arms around the problem of lies and abuse.Real lives are on the line, not just cyber lives.

Why Small-Caps Remain Some Of The Top Stocks To Invest In (MMYT);2/16/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe other day, a headline in a financial publication caught my attention. ""Small Is No Longer Beautiful,"" it read.makeArticleAd();I was intrigued. I knew all about the strength in small-cap stocks this past year and how their strong post-election rally started to fizzle in December.But would I go so far as to predict that these stocks have totally lost their appeal compared with their large and mega-cap peers?I don't think so.Yes, it's true that the Russell 2000, represented on the chart by theiShares Russell 2000 ETF(IWM), strongly outperformed theS&P 500(SPY) index of U.S. large-cap stocks over the past year.And it might also be true that the index was getting a little ahead of itself, as suggested by its December pause.Russell 2000 (IWM) Up Big Last YearBut I'm not interested in buying the index.InGame-Changing Stocks, my premium advisory, I am tasked with finding companies - not indices - that are poised to break rules, outgrow competition, become household names or start new trends. I scour the market for the top stocks to invest in to follow developing technologies and trends. And here, small caps carry some advantages.Incredibly, even in our information age, small-cap companies still don't get enough coverage compared with their large-cap peers.Virtually no development can go unnoticed for larger tech firms likeApple Inc.(AAPL) orFacebook Inc(FB). After all, more than 50 Wall Street analysts cover each company, not to mention TV and print journalists. On the other hand, major developments in many smaller companies can go unnoticed for quite some time. These firms simply fly under radar.7 High-Risk, High-Reward Stocks to Buy NowSmall companies on the verge of technological breakthroughs or on the forefront of a new trend can be fully expected to benefit from another feature of the market: Money is still cheap to borrow. Large companies, especially tech leaders, have a lot of cash on their balance sheets. That could lead to a spree of mergers and acquisitions, which would be beneficial to the small caps being picked up.Cash On Hand, Selected Large CapsWhen large-cap companies have this much cash on hand, this means their ability to make money has exceeded their ability to be innovative. In such cases, buying smaller innovators is often the easiest path to new breakthroughs. All things considered, it's easy to predict that these tech giants' cash is going to provide long-term support to a period of strong merger-and-acquisition activity.And even if I'm overestimating the willingness of these tech giants to buy their smaller peers, the mere fact that their cash balances have ballooned to these incredible amounts should serve as a support (or a ""floor"") under the smaller-cap companies' share prices, especially for those companies that prove themselves to be on the forefront of the newest and most disruptive technologies.The rule-breakers and the game-changers are, therefore, likely to be in a position to leverage their achievements as their large- and mega-cap peers remain under pressure from the markets to deliver consistent quarterly earnings growth.As a group, small caps are also set to benefit from other new developments that can make them some of the top stocks to invest in for 2017.One of those benefits is the tax reform expected from the new administration. Smaller companies are likely to benefit more than the others from corporate tax cuts: These smaller organizations usually have no resources to utilize tax-avoidance schemes, and they are usually more domestically-oriented, so they have less reason to stash cash abroad.Another reason for investors to continue concentrating in smaller-cap stocks is that there are literally thousands small-cap companies to choose from: The benchmark Russell 2000 Index contains 2,000 stocks, and there are also smaller, micro-capitalization stocks not included in the index. And that's even before we consider international small caps, such asMakeMyTrip Limited(MMYT).Of course, mid-caps and even large-caps, if they present especially compelling cases, would not be off-limits, for me and myGame-Changing Stocksreaders. Not all of them are disrupters, of course - not all of them are even ""growth"" stocks.But my job is to find those that are, and then to figure out the potential of those companies, to identify and discuss early developments that are about to make them the top stocks to invest in.The 5 Best Stocks to Buy for Big Emerging Markets ProfitsAny way you look at it, I think it's clear that there's still a place for small-cap stocks in your portfolio. If you agree, thenconsider checking out my special report.

Intel Corporation Reportedly Prepping 14-Nanometer LTE Modem for 2018 Shipments;2/16/2017;"Analysts with Bernstein Research distributed a note to clients   after microprocessor giantIntel(NASDAQ: INTC) hosted its Feb. 9 investor meeting. In the note,   the analysts say that Intel plans to introduce cellular modems   manufactured in its 14-nanometer technology (rather than on   older, third-party manufacturing technologies) in the second half   of 2018.The analysts say that Intel is not only planning to introduce   these chips, but that they plan to ship ""tens of millions of   units"" in the second half of 2018.Intel wireless chief, Aicha Evans. Image source: Intel.makeArticleAd();""Given the only high volume purchaser of stand-alone modems   remains [Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) ], this suggests share at least maintained if not   increased,"" the analysts write.The report also says that Intel was ""coy on CDMA capability""   but that the analysts ""believe it is a possibility,"" noting that   if Intel does indeed include CDMA capabilities in this modem, it   would be a ""further potential headwind forQualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM) .""In this column, I'd like to explain why the move to an   in-house manufactured modem is so important for Intel and Apple,   and why inclusion of CDMA capabilities could negatively impact   Qualcomm, as the Bernstein analysts suggest.The advantages of going in-houseRight now, Intel's modems are manufactured by a third party   (believed to beTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company(NYSE: TSM) , though Intel hasn't, to my knowledge, officially   confirmed this). Moreover, they are manufactured on relatively   old 28-nanometer chip technology.By moving the modem in-house, Intel should enjoy several   benefits compared to its current manufacturing arrangement.First, Intel must pay TSMC for each wafer of chips that the   latter manufactures. This means that Intel not only bears the   burden of the raw materials and manufacturing costs, but TSMC   marks those wafers up and makes significant profit margin per   wafer sold (in the ballpark of 50%).By moving this to in-house manufacturing, Intel is still on   the hook for raw materials and manufacturing cost (and some will   argue that Intel's per-wafer manufacturing costs are higher than   TSMC's), but it doesn't need to fork over profit margins to   TSMC.Instead, Intel could theoretically be able to either boost its   own profit margin on the chips that it sells to Apple (this   assumes that Intel's wafer costs aren't so high that they offset   not having to pay TSMC's margins), or maintain the same margins   that it did before, but lower its chip prices to Apple   (potentially opening share gain opportunities).Beyond that, though, newer manufacturing technologies tend to   bring power efficiency benefits over older ones. The transition   from TSMC's 28-nanometer technology to Intel's 14-nanometer   (presumably an ""optimized"" 14-nanometer+ or 14-nanometer++   variant) technology should enable a significant reduction in both   active and stand-by power -- potentially boosting battery   life.The more technically competent Intel's modems are (better   power efficiency is clearly a valuable example of that), the more   likely that Apple is going to want to use them in its   products.The CDMA questionRight now, Apple uses Qualcomm modems in iPhone models that   support the CDMA wireless standard and Intel modems in the iPhone   models that don't. If Apple had to, it could use Qualcomm modems   in every single iPhone sold and it wouldn't be a problem; the   same can't be said about the Intel modems which wouldn't work   properly on CDMA networks.If Intel can integrate CDMA capability into the modem that   it's expected to ship to Apple for the 2018 iPhone, then Apple   will presumably be able to use either Intel or Qualcomm modems   interchangeably.That's a negative for Qualcomm because it opens the company up   to either additional potential share loss (Apple could keep   Qualcomm in the loop but further reduce its allocation), or it   could lead to an erosion of Qualcomm's pricing power (in a recent   lawsuit, Apple alleges that Qualcomm charges it extra for modems   with CDMA capability enabled).Neither situation would be good for Qualcomm's Apple   business.As to whether we'll see CDMA in Intel's 2018 modem, it's   interesting that Intel was reportedly ""coy"" about this, per   Bernstein. Perhaps Intel is working to build the technology into   that 2018 modem, but the company isn't confident that the   implementation will be robust enough to pass carrier   certification in the timeframe that it would need to for Apple to   be comfortable using it.I do expect that Intel will eventually implement CDMA in   future modems, though.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

3 Naked Puts That Let You Keep Your Shirt;2/16/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWith options expiration upon us - or at least the monthly version of it - it's a good time to look at selling naked puts for March expiration.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockIf possible, I like selling naked puts about a month out, because if I can get a 1.7% to 2.5% premium on them, then they make for a very nice annualized return. This is one of the strategies I'll be using to enhance income for my forthcoming stock advisory newsletter,The Liberty Portfolio.Remember, you are selling naked puts, and that means you are selling the right for another investor to sell (or ""put"") a given stock to you at a given strike price on or before a given expiration date of the contract.7 Stocks to Sell or Short Before the Bears StrikeSo if you get the stock put to you, be certain it's a stock you actually want to hold.Naked Puts: Mastercard (MA)Source:Karlis Dambrans via Flickr (modified)Mastercard Inc(NYSE:MA) isn't the undervalued growth stock it was a few years ago, and it's trading just off its previous all-time high at $109.66. However, it's hard to go wrong with it or one of the other big card providers.Although I'm a bit sad thatnet income only grew about 7%year-over-year, and it's a bit pricey at 30 times earnings, MA stock remains a premier financial services company.MA stock also offers some decent premiums, although volatility lately hasn't been terribly attractive. Still, if you look at the 17 March $110 naked puts, you can sell two of them for $1.90 each, and earn $380. That just barely hits a 1.8% return, or 22% annualized.Even if MA stock gets put to you and you decide you don't want it, you can always turn around and sell covered calls against those shares. Thus, you'll earn a premium for that sale, and if it's set at a strike price equal to or above the price it was put to you at, you could end up even further ahead.Warren Buffett just tooklarge stakes in the four largest U.S. airlines. This was incredible because he once called airlines a ""death trap for investors."" The move seems centered around the idea that Trump may lower corporate taxes, which would substantially improve profits for the airlines.Naked Puts: Alaska Air (ALK)Source: ShutterstockPersonally, I likeAlaska Air Group, Inc.(NYSE:ALK), especially since itbought out Virgin Airlines. That was a bold move, and it creates a high-quality merged operation that customers love.Airlines are doing well as travel has picked up and I think they will continue to do well as the economy improves under the new administration. ALK stock has really soared this past year, but with Wednesday's close at $96.96, you have a shot to sell some naked puts here.7 Stocks Warren Buffett Is Buying or SellingThe 17 March $95 naked puts are selling for $2. If you sell two of these, you collect $400 and hit a total so far of $780.Naked Puts: Apple (AAPL)Source: ShutterstockWith the market continuing to move up andApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) delivering solid results, investors appear to have become bullish again on AAPL. Once again, we point to Buffett, who quadrupled his position in Apple stock.I think part of this reasoning is not merely that AAPL is operationally doing fairly well again, but because a Trump corporate tax cut would mean Apple can repatriate its $230 billion of overseas cash. That would save it billions in taxes that could be then spun out as a special dividend.Regardless, with Apple stock closing on Wednesday at $135.51, consider selling the 24 March $135 naked puts for $2.50. That is, sell just one of them, and get $250. That brings your total to $1,030. You'll also have a 51-cent buffer between the closing price and strike price. That may not seem very large, but anything can happen when expiration rolls around.Lawrence Meyers is the CEO of PDL Capital, and manager of the forthcomingLiberty Portfolio stock newsletter.

Apple Reaches All-Time High on Dividend Hike & Buyback Talks;2/16/2017;"Apple Inc. (AAPL)reached an all-time intraday high of $136.27 on Feb 15. The stock price also jumped for the third consecutive trading session to close a tad lower at $135.51.The momentum in Apple's share price is not surprising as the company has outperformed the Zacks categorizedComputer Miniindustry in the last one year. While the stock returned 38.11%, the industry gained 37.14% over the same period.The recent upside can be attributed to the tech giant's announcement of better dividend payouts and buybacks if the new government under Donald Trump lowers U.S. corporate tax rate. A lower tax rate will help the company to repatriate its offshore cash, which as per The Wall Street Journal was almost 91% of its total cash balance.Notably, since Trump's election win, Apple's shares have gained 24.31% compared with the industry's growth of 15.22%.Moreover, legendary investor Warren Buffett's move to buy Apple shares have instilled confidence among investors who, not so long ago, had questioned the company's future.What's Driving Apple?Riding high on the holiday season sales, this California-based company posted revenues of $78.4 billion in its first quarter fiscal 2017. Apple's flagship product iPhone made a comeback with almost 78.3 million units sold in the quarter, an increase of 5% from the year-ago quarter. Revenues from iPhone grew 5.5 % to $54.4 billion (69.4% of total revenue) year over year.Apple Inc. PriceApple Inc. Price|Apple Inc. QuoteApple's shares have been on the rise since its earnings announcement on Jan 31, 2017. Moreover, the company has inched past Samsung in terms of market share as per a latest report from Gartner, which is a positive.The future looks bright for Apple considering the increasing expectations for iPhone 8. Reportedly, the new iPhone will feature unique technological upgrades like augmented reality, OLED display and also support wireless charging. Furthermore, rumors of the upcoming models being equipped with an iris-scanner are also doing the rounds. All these are expected to revive revenue growth.The Trump CardHowever, Apple CFO Luca Maestri has expressed concerns regarding Trump's border tax on imports. Apple largely depends on manufacturing units in China, Mongolia, Korea and Taiwan and the tax is likely to increase its prices.The tax is likely to disrupt the iPhone maker's plan to set up its first manufacturing and assembling unit in Bangalore, India. The company's decision to move to India is based on the growing per capita income of the country's middle-class and rising smartphone users in the sub-continent.However, we believe that Apple can tweak its device selling policy to avoid a possible Trump tax on imports by selling the lower priced India-made product in the sub-continent and adjoining markets only. The comparatively lower-priced device will help Apple gain revenue share in the region.Moving ForwardApple's Services business is expected to remain strong. Moreover, in the long run, Apple is expected to benefit from its robust cash position, strength in technology, the ecosystem that it has built and its loyal customer base. Further, its enterprise collaborations with the likes of Deloitte, IBM Corp.IBM, Cisco and SAP SESAPare expected to be important long-term growth drivers.We believe that the buzz surrounding iPhone 8 should allay investors' fear about iPhone sales trajectory and help its market performance. Moreover, Apple is likely to gain from its focus on the budding Indian market irrespective of Trump's import ban.Zacks Rank & Stock MovementAt present, Apple has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the wider technology space is Oclaro Inc.OCLR, which carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Apple Inc. (AAPL) Careens Closer to Major AR Announcement;2/16/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) CEO Tim Cook has been talking an awful lot lately about augmented reality - or AR. The latest episode was last week, when hecompared the technology to the iPhonein terms of its potential to be big.makeArticleAd();Source: NanticAfter months of repeatedly playing up AR in public, it's beginning to feel as if Cook is setting the expectations of the press and public about the technology.That begs the question: Is Apple Inc. planning a major augmented reality announcement?AR vs. VR: What's the Difference?Augmented reality is related to virtual reality - or VR - but the two are also very different.Virtual reality uses technology to completely immerse people in a virtual world. This requires powerful computing hardware and special headgear. VR has spent several years as the next big thing, culminating withFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) buying VR pioneer Oculus for $2 billion in 2014.Virtual reality hasn't quite caught on in a big way - the expensive and awkward equipment is a big hurdle to overcome - but gamers have begun embracing it.7 Stocks Warren Buffett Is Buying or SellingSo far, Apple has shown no interest in virtual reality and Tim Cook has actually made a point in several interviews of downplaying VR. In the latest, when Cook spoke toThe Independent, he laments the fact that virtual reality""closes the world out.""""Most people don't want to lock themselves out from the world for a long period of time and today you can't do that because you get sick from it.""The antisocial aspects of virtual reality, the equipment requirements and side effects such as motion sickness have been common themes in Cook's argument against virtual reality.However, he is very excited by augmented reality and its ability to go mainstream. Instead of locking a person into a virtual world, AR overlays the existing world with additional information. One of the most popular examples of AR in action is the gamePokemon Go, released last summer. That game was themost downloaded app of 2016on Apple Inc.'s App Store.Is Apple Inc. Planning a Major AR Announcement?Tim Cook's views on augmented reality seem to have been getting more positive in the past few months, reaching the point where he's actively hyping the technology.In October, he said:""I do think that a significant portion of the population of developed countries, and eventually all countries, will have AR experiences every day, almost like eating three meals a day. It will become that much a part of you.""And last week, he toldThe Independent:""I regard it as a big idea like the smartphone. The smartphone is for everyone, we don't have to think the iPhone is about a certain demographic, or country or vertical market: it's for everyone. I think AR is that big, it's huge.""What's holding AR back is the technology.Hardware doesn't need to be as powerful as the silicon needed to drive virtual reality gear. And rather than a fully enclosed headpiece or goggles - that themselves are so complex they can cost $600 on top of the PC needed to drive them - augmented reality can be delivered through specialized eyeglasses or on a smartphone's display. The problem is current efforts haven't been quite good enough.Alphabet Inc's(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) failed Google Glass is the best-known example of the AR overlay glasses model, whilePokemon Goshows the relatively primitive AR experience that current smartphones can deliver.What if Tim Cook has been playing up augmented reality (and dissing VR) because Apple Inc. is preparing to make a major push into AR? It could be the company that takes augmented reality mainstream by nailing the hardware, while everyone else is distracted by trying to get consumers to buy into VR.There has been speculation that Apple is working with German optics firmCarl Zeiss AGonApple-branded AR glasses. The iPhone 8 could also incorporate next generation hardware - from cameras to CPU and GPU - that are optimized to make AR a killer feature.Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock Could Win Big With 'Windows Cloud'We'll have to wait until the company is ready to show its hand to know exactly what is up. But based on Tim Cook's continued promotion of the technology, it seems likely that Apple Inc. is priming us for AR-related announcement.And if Cook is even close to being right about augmented reality having the potential to be as big as the iPhone, the upside for Apple stock could be huge.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace7 Stocks to Sell or Short Before the Bears Strike3 Tire Stocks That Are Burning Rubber in ChinaThe postApple Inc.

Apple (AAPL) Reclaims Crown of Top Smartphone Maker From Samsung;2/16/2017;"Apple iPhone (Shutterstock photo)Can anything stop Apple (AAPL) in 2017? The Cupertino-based tech giant, which has been on a winning streak over the past year, just did something it hasn’t been able to do in two years: Call itself the world's top smartphone company.According to data just released research firm Gartner, Apple has surpassed Samsung (SSNLF) in terms of unit sales, relegating its South Korean rival to second place. Gartner noted that Apple, which now controls 17.9% of the global smartphone market, sold 77.04 million iPhones during the fourth quarter of 2016, narrowly beating the 76.78 million sold by Samsung.makeArticleAd();The difference of 256,000 units is the closest the two companies have been from each other, said Gartner. But it was just enough to grant Apple the smartphone crown by 10 basis points to Samsung, which ended the quarter with a global smartphone market share of 17.8%. You would have to go all the way back to the fourth quarter of 2014 to find Apple was the undisputed smartphone leader.""Samsung's smartphone sales started to drop in the third quarter of 2016, and the decision to discontinue the Galaxy Note 7 slowed down sales of its smartphone portfolio in the fourth quarter,"" said Gartner analyst Anshul Gupta, in a statement. During the third quarter of last year, Samsung was forced to recall millions of Galaxy Note 7 due to exploding batteries. Apple, meanwhile,capitalizedon Samsung’s misfortune ramping up iPhone production at various points in the last six months.Last month Apple reported its fiscal 2017 first quarter earnings results that not only beat Wall Street estimates on earnings per share and revenue, Apple also topped analysts’ forecasts for iPhone unit shipments, selling 78 million devices, almost 1 million more than analysts were looking for. “We sold more iPhones than ever before and set all-time revenue records for iPhone, Services, Mac and Apple Watch,” said CEO Tim Cook in a statement.By contrast, in Samsung’s third quarter, its mobile segment suffered a decline in profits, which was not a surprise. Though fourth quarter profits came higher, thanks to better-than-expected demand for the Galaxy S, there’s still the question of whether the Samsung can regain the customers it lost to Apple, which — thanks to the success of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus — continues to boast gaining an increase number of switchers from other platforms.Apple’s success have translated to increased momentum in AAPL stock, which closed Wednesday at a new 52-week high of $135.51. The shares have risen 17% year to date, while climbing 44% over the past year. And with services revenue, which generates higher profit margins, taking a larger portion of Apple’s business, AAPL stock — despite trading at all-time highs — remains a bargain."

Trade Apple, Inc. or Own It? I Have the Answer!;2/16/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWe've all heard the argument that it's wrong to tradeApple, Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL). Many prominent experts rage over those who dare to trade around the price action of AAPL stock. It is confusing to investors to figure out who is wrong. Sure, I could spend a few hours parsing data and calculating returns while making assumptions of entry and exit spots. Or, I can accept the fact that they are both right to a degree.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockOn the one hand, it is undeniable that owning Apple stock for decades has been a winning proposition. But so was trading around the chop. It comes down to what works for each us individually. Most investors enter positions but get stopped out when things go wrong. So I will refrain from judging which group is smarter.I found neutral ground using AAPL options. I commit to Apple long-term, especially when it falls out of favor, and leave myself room for error. I do so with no money out of pocket, thereby rendering my risk to a fraction of owning the stock.Last month, I created $5 per contract out of thin air trading AAPL stock when ithad appeared to be too late. Even more recently, I repeated for another $1.2 yield in mere days.This strategy is easy to do on equities that are solid and what some would consider sure things like AAPL orAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL). I am less easy about doing this with sayNetflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX). With stocks that are perceived to be risky,such as Netflix, I would need to be pickier with my entry and exit points.Today, I want to repeat performance regardless of which whale bought Apple or who sold it.How to Trade AAPL Stock HereThe Trade - Long AAPL:Sell the AAPL 2018 $105 put for $2.70 to open. The 22% price buffer from current levels translate into a 90% theoretical chance of success. I only sell naked puts if I am willing and able to own AAPL stock at the strike sold. Some investors prefer spreading the risk into a credit put spread instead, and that works too.7 Stocks Warren Buffett Is Buying or SellingClick to EnlargeI have been a longtime harsh critic of Tim Cook, so I don't count myself as an AAPL bull, but I do know how to do math. Apple's valuation makes sense at $100 or even $200 per share given current conditions. So I do trust selling risk against that fact rather than chase hope that Tim Cook is able to grow the company.For now, he has a boulder that is hard to stop, and I can count on buyers to support the price.I realize that markets are at all-time highs and precariously perched. So I could buy sacrifice puts in AAPL stock to guard against a market crash. For example, I could spend 20 cents buying the AAPL Jun $100 put to limit my loss if we fall off a cliff in the next four months.I am not required to hold my trades through expiration. I can close it for partial gains or losses at any time.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director ofSellSpreads.com.

Go Short Netflix, Inc. (NFLX) Stock Before It Dives;2/16/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAfter an epic 50% rally of the late September lows at $95, shares ofNetflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX) appear to have stalled out. Major overhead resistance now looms, and I expect NFLX stock to pull back and enter a consolidation phase in coming weeks.makeArticleAd();There is no disputing the strength of the recent rally, with the last leg likely fueled by short covering. Short interest has fallen substantially over the past months as Netflix stock continued to head higher and higher.Now that the shorts have been taken out, however, the fuel for a further rally must come more from a fundamental basis. A market cap exceeding $60 billion and a price-to-earnings ratio of more than 300 on NFLX will make that much less likely to justify at current levels.Due to the insane fundamental valuation metrics, NFLX stock has always traded more on technical merits. From a technical standpoint, Netflix shares are definitely looking toppy. The $145 level is now a critical resistance level.Click to EnlargeMore importantly, the uptrend line has been broken in Netflix, and shares now may be putting in a double top at the $142.50 area.7 Stocks to Sell or Short Before the Bears StrikeA further down-leg in NFLX will serve to confirm the end to the trend.Click to EnlargeNetflix also recently generated a MACD sell signal, which has proven to be a reliable indicator of short-term tops in the past. MACD is a momentum indicator and validates the idea that Netflix stock is losing momentum and is poised for a pullback.Click to EnlargeImplied volatility (IV) is also showing some bearish signs. Current IV levels are at only the 6% percentile, indicating a high degree of complacency. This is normally a solid contrarian indicator and signals that euphoria may have run its course.Inmy previous post on Netflix, I talked about some of the hurdles facing Netflix, which are still valid. In a similar fashion to then, I expect a short-term pullback in NFLX shares. With IV at such low levels, long volatility strategies are warranted.How to Trade NFLX Stock HereBuy the March $140 puts and sell the 24 Feb $137 puts for a $2.60 net debitMaximum risk on the trade is $260 per spread. Ideally, NFLX stock closes near $137 on Feb. 24 expiration.I would use a meaningful breakout to new highs past the $145 level as a stop.As of this writing, Tim Biggam did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Thursday’s Vital Data: Apple Inc. (AAPL), Groupon Inc (GRPN) and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (BMY);2/16/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsU.S. stock futures are feeling the heat this morning, and Wall Street is set to take a breather following the longest record-setting winning streak in nearly 25 years. All three of the major market indices are up, on average, 1.6% so far this week, driven by positive economic data, President Donald Trump's promises for a massive tax plan and Fed Chair Janet Yellen's hints at a March interest rate hike. The euphoria has some analysts saying the market has come too far too fast.makeArticleAd();As a result, futures on theS&P 500are down 0.17% heading into the open, followed byDow Jones Industrial Averagefutures, off 0.15%, andNasdaq-100futures, which have shed a mere 0.02% at last check.On the options front, volume surged to a near-term high on Wednesday, as roughly 20.5 million calls and 16.7 million puts changed hands on the session. Over on the CBOE, the single-session equity put/call volume ratio ticked higher to 0.58, while the 10-day moving average edged lower to another one-month low of 0.65.Turning to Wednesday's volume leaders,Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) overtookSamsungas the No. 1 smartphone seller in the fourth quarter, though it took quite a bit of effort to get there. Elsewhere,Bristol-Myers Squibb Co(NYSE:BMY) rallied for a second straight session amid heavy call options volume and rumors of a potential takeover bid. Finally,Groupon Inc(NASDAQ:GRPN) posted stronger-than-expected earnings and revealed thatAlibaba Group Holding Ltd(NYSE:BABA) has taken a 5.7% stake in the company.Apple Inc. (AAPL)Apple is once again back at the top of the smartphone market, according to the latestdata from Gartner Research. Apple sold 77 million smartphones in the quarter, edging out Samsung's 76.8 million units sold. While the headline is impressive, it took headline-news-worthy battery issues for Samsung's Galaxy S7 and the withdrawal of the Galaxy Note 7 from store shelves to boost Apple into the top spot.7 Stocks Warren Buffett Is Buying or SellingFor AAPL options traders, however, a win is a win. The stock saw volume soar to 1.35 million contracts on Wednesday, with calls snapping up an above average 65% of the day's take. But not everyone has bought into the AAPL hype, as the March put/call open interest ratio of 1.44 ranks near the upper echelons of its annual range, with puts easily outnumbering calls among options set to expire within the next month.Peak put OI for the month totals 41,000 contracts at the March $130 strike, with another 32,000 open at the $100 strike.Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (BMY)Rumors tend to emerge in the wake of product failures - a situation that is especially true in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical markets. Bristol-Myers stock has shed some 30% in the past several months after reporting that a promising cancer drug had failed to meet its endpoints in clinical trials. The company's weakness has spawned rumors that that Roche,Novartis AG (ADR)(NYSE:NVS), andPfizer Inc.(NYSE:PFE) areactively exploring a BMY takeover, withGilead Sciences, Inc.(NASDAQ:GILD) also said to be considering a deal.BMY stock has surged nearly 6% in the past two days on the potential for a buyout offer, sending options traders scrambling to speculation on such a deal. On Wednesday, BMY saw near-term high volume of 232,000 contracts, wherein calls accounted for 77% of the day's take.The attention has driven BMY's March put/call open interest ratio sharply lower to rest at 0.44, with calls more than doubling puts in the series, versus a February ratio just north of 0.90. What's more, peak March call OI rests at the well-overhead $60 strike, totaling more than 40,000 contracts. A takeover deal could reward these brave call traders, but no deal could see the shares plummet back below $50.Groupon Inc (GRPN)After backsliding 6% in the past three months, GRPN stock roared more than 23% higher yesterday following an impressive earnings report. For the quarter, Groupon said it earned seven cents per share on revenue of $934.9 million, compared to expectations for a profit of three cents per share on revenue of $913 million.Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Stock Isn't Done CorrectingFurthermore, GRPN saidAlibaba has taken a passive 5.7% stakein the company, which is notable since Alibaba has expressed interest in acquiring Groupon.Options volume on GRPN was quite bullish following the news. Calls flooded into the stock, making up a whopping 83% of the more than 212,000 contracts traded yesterday. GRPN is set to close out the week north of $4.50, placing the stock well above peak Feb call OI of 14,000 contracts at the $4 strike. Resistance is tough in the $5 region, however, and GRPN could see some consolidation following yesterday's pop higher.As of this writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceTrade of the Day: Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (GDX) Waves a Bull Flag7 Stocks to Sell or Short Before the Bears Strike7 Sports Stocks to Buy That Any Investor Can OwnThe postThursday's Vital Data: Apple Inc.

5 Explosive Growth Stocks to Tap Best Win Streak in 25 Years;2/16/2017;"All the three major market averages have been on a tear since last week when President Donald Trump pledged to release details on his promised tax cuts within two to three weeks. Barring Trump's tax reforms, Wall Street also celebrated strength in the American economy. January data indicating higher retail sales and consumer inflation helped propel stocks, while the fourth-quarter earnings picture continues to be comforting.As the equity market continues to gain traction in the near term, it will be prudent to invest in solid growth stocks. Dispelling skepticism over an overheated market, earnings of such stocks are poised to grow at an above-average rate relative to the market.Rally in Stock PricesThe Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq skyrocketed to record highs on Feb 15, the fifth straight day of an all-time high. All the three major U.S. equity indices achieved this feat since a six-session string ended Jan 3, 1992, according to Dow Jones data.After crossing the key physiological bar of 20,000, the Dow is now approaching the 21,000 mark, while the S&P 500 had already topped $20 trillion in combined market-capitalization for the first time ever. The benchmark index has not experienced more than 1% daily loss since Trump's election victory while it gained over 10% since that period.The Nasdaq also notched its longest record streak since the dot com bubble of 1999. The Nasdaq zoomed to the seventh successive record high on Feb 15, which helped the tech-laden index catch up to the Dow's post-election surge. Both are now up about 12% since Nov 8.Trump's Tax Policies Annihilate BearsWall Street pushed further into record territory on the ongoing optimism that Trump will cut corporate taxes. His plans to revive a 'phenomenal' tax cut plan revitalized expectations of a pro-growth agenda that took a backseat amid contentious immigration ban and protectionist trade rules.Trump plans to overhaul tax codes for business and individuals over the next two to three weeks. He plans a multi-trillion-dollar tax cut that would boost the U.S. economy and lift corporate profits. Such a tax cut included trimming of the business tax rate to 15% from 35%, reducing individual tax rates and repealing the estate tax. He also proposed expanding tax break for child-care expenses.Such a plan will reduce federal taxes by $4.4 trillion to $5.9 trillion over a decade and is expected to increase GDP between 6.9% and 8.2%. Moreover, if he succeeds in overhauling the tax policy, it could allow multinationals to bring back the vast amount of cash stashed overseas, which then could be used to pay hefty dividends, buy back stocks, execute acquisitions and construct factories. Companies like Apple Inc.AAPLhas an incredible $230 billion in cash held overseas, while many other have vast sums of money parked abroad (read more:5 Stocks to Buy as Trump Chalks Out 'Phenomenal' Tax Plan).Economic Data Robust, Earnings ReassuringBetter-than-expected rise in retail sales coupled with consumer prices recording the highest gain in almost four years in January reinforced confidence in the economy, which followed an upbeat fourth-quarter earnings season.Many U.S. retailers posted strong sales in January including the beleaguered department stores. Following a much bigger gain in December, retail sales rose 0.4% last month, ahead of the consensus estimate of a gain of 0.1%.  Excluding autos and gasoline, retail sales rose 0.7%, according to the Commerce Department. It seems higher consumer confidence since the election encouraged Americans to spend more. The economy's strengthening outlook was bolstered by another report showing a rise in manufacturing and mining production last month as the drag from loweroil pricessubsided.Fourth-quarter earnings, in the meantime, are on track to be the highest ever. As of Feb 15, 375 S&P 500 members have reported their releases so far. Earnings for these members are up 7.2% on 4.6% higher revenues, with 68.8% beating EPS estimates and 54.4% coming ahead of top-line expectations (read more:A Positive & Reassuring Earnings Picture).5 Top-Ranked Growth Stocks to Buy NowThanks to the rise in major indices and the signs of a strengthening economy, investing in growth stocks seems to be judicious.

Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Stock Isn’t Done Correcting Yet;2/16/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBusiness forNvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA) appears to be firing on all cylinders, but the charts of NVDA stock are showing a trend in motion that's a wee bit top-heavy. Thus, if you're looking to get on board one of the hottest stocks of the past year, I have a trade idea that helps discount some of the hype.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockIf we're to believe Nvidia's latest earnings report, it just doesn't get any better. It was a""great finish to a record year""as the company topped forecasts and bumped up guidance.But there lies the rub. NVDA stock is faced with the possibility of becoming a victim of its own success onandoff the price chart.Longer-term, Nvidia appears to be in all the right markets poised for secular growth. From autonomous vehicles to gaming to virtual reality to cloud computing, NVDA is well-positioned for continued success. You'll get no argument from me here.But Nvidia's success isn't exactly a secret at this point, and that's becoming a growing problem. For one, there's an inflated price for admission, with Nvidia stock sporting lofty ratios such as a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 33, price-to-sales of 8.5 and a price/earnings-to-growth ratio of 3.4.7 Stocks Warren Buffett Is Buying or SellingPlus, NVDA now faces rising operating costs, potential gross margin compression, as well as data center, custom silicon and GPU workarounds competition.Nvidia could prove a very costly investment.Failing that, the chart of NVDA stock is warning that a day of reckoning is nigh.Nvidia Stock ChartClick to EnlargeWith NVDA shares up roughly 300% in the past 52 weeks, traders buying shares today are placing a lot of technical faith in extreme momentum continuing, rather than an overdue cycle of profit-taking beginning.In my view, bullishness at Nvidia's current price is misplaced.After 10 months of price action remaining tethered to Nvidia's upper Bollinger Band, shares are forming a bearish topping candle on the monthly chart. That's after hitting a brief and marginal all-time high in the immediate aftermath of the earnings report.Even the best-sounding, well-supported growth narratives eventually give way to meaningful price corrections, even if they eventually resume their rallies. I don't expect Nvidia stock to be an anomaly to that durable tendency.How to Trade NVDA Stock Right NowOne strategy that could allow you to profit from a correction in Nvidia and/or buy shares at a discount is an out-of-the-money credit put spread.I suggest the March $100/$95 put vertical.Trade of the Day: Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (GDX) Waves a Bull FlagNVDA stock is at $108.90, and the trade is priced at 60 cents. The spread collects the full credit as long as shares aren't below $100 at expiration. That would require a decline of more than 8%, which would put Nvidia's total correction at 17%.We're looking to get paid as Nvidia diffuses its overbought condition. At the same time, the vertical does limit risk to $4.40 if the stock were to establish a stiffer correction below the protective $95 put strike.If we ultimately want to buy NVDA stock on weakness, the most we'll pay is $99.40.Also, if Nvidia establishes a larger (but still commonly corrective) move of 30% to $84.50 during the life of this vertical, the worst-case scenario is that our initial purchase price would work out to $89.90 through either assignment, or closing the spread and buying NVDA stock.Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in any of the securities or their derivatives mentioned in this article.

Here's What Warren Buffett Is Buying and Selling -- Should You Join Him?;2/16/2017;"According toBerkshire Hathaway's(NYSE: BRK-A) (NYSE: BRK-B) latest SEC filing, Warren Buffett and   company had an active fourth quarter in 2016. After sitting on a   company record $85 billion cash hoard at the end of the third   quarter, and having said that Berkshire spent $12 billion on   common stocks in the wake of Donald Trump's election victory,   investors have been wondering what Berkshire has been up to.   Here's the answer.What Berkshire has been buyingWhile we don't necessarily know the reasoning behind   Berkshire's latest investments, or whether they were initiated by   Warren Buffett himself or one of his trusted stock pickers, we do   know what changed in Berkshire's portfolio during the fourth   quarter. Here are the most notable buys:Image Source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();1.Apple-- Berkshire already ownedApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) , although the company's $2 billion stake wasn't a   large amount by Berkshire's standards. During the fourth quarter,   Berkshire's Apple stake nearly quadrupled to about 57 million   shares, which represent more than 1% of all the outstandingApple stock. It's interesting to note that Buffett's stock-pickers were the   ones who initiated the Apple investment, but given the size of   the increase, the latest Apple addition could have come from   Buffett himself.This investment did not surprise me at all. I'vewritten beforehow Apple still represented a compelling bargain at the price   levels it was trading for during the fourth quarter, and that   Berkshire should take advantage. Well, apparently, management   agreed.2.Airlines-- Berkshire surprised many investors when it revealed its   third-quarter 2016 investments in several airline stocks. After   all, Buffett has spoken out against airline stocks as investments   several times in his career,During the third quarter, Berkshire invested inAmerican Airlines,Delta, andUnited Continental, and increased its stake in all three during the fourth quarter.   At the same time the initial airline stakes were revealed,   Buffett also said he made an investment inSouthwest Airlines. He didn't specify the amount at the time, but we now know it's   a stake worth more than $2 billion.3.Monsanto-- Berkshire revealed a new stake inMonsanto, of about eight million shares valued at about $872 million.   Monsanto currently trades for about $109 per share, and the   company plans to sell itself to Bayer for $128. If the deal goes   through, Buffett stands to make a quick profit, but the market   doesn't seem convinced at this point.4.Sirius XM-- The final major change was the addition of a nearly 167   million share position in satellite radio operatorSirius XM. Granted, because of the company's $4.80 share price as of this   writing, this stake translates into a relatively small (for   Berkshire) $800 million investment.What Berkshire has been selling1.Wal-Mart-- Buffett has been gradually trimming hisWal-Martstake for some time, but he sold a substantial number of his   remaining shares. Berkshire's investment in the retail giant has   been cut from about 13 million shares to 1.4 million. As I've   mentioned, we don't know the reasoning, but my guess is that the   success of online retailers like Amazon has changed the   competitive landscape in a way Buffett doesn't like.2.Verizon-- Berkshire sold nearly all of its 15 million shares ofVerizonduring the quarter. Since Berkshire also unloaded itsAT&Tstake earlier in 2016, this didn't come as a huge surprise to   me.3.Kinder Morgan-- Buffett bought about 20 million shares ofKinder Morganin early 2016, and sold his entire position during the fourth   quarter. Kinder Morgan has nearly doubled from its early 2016   lows, so this could be a matter of the valuation simply not   looking attractive to Buffett anymore.4.Deere-- Just like Kinder Morgan,Deerehas rallied sharply, up by about 43% over the past year alone.   So, while we don't know for sure, this sale could potentially be   due to a valuation issue as well.Should you follow Buffett's moves?Not necessarily. For one thing, by the time we even hear about   what Buffett is doing, it can be a completely different market.   Since the fourth quarter ended, the S&P has risen by more   than 4%, and some of the stocks Buffett has bought have risen   even higher than that. Apple, for example, has risen by nearly   17% since the end of 2016, and Apple was trading even cheaper for   much of the quarter. While I don't necessarily think Apple is too   expensive to buy right now, it's fair to say that Buffett and   company likely got a far better deal on their Apple shares than   investors could get now.^SPXdata byYChartsIn addition, while it can be fun to speculate, we don't really   knowwhyBuffett bought or sold any of these stocks. For that reason, it's   important to do your own research and make your investment   decisions based on what's best for you and your long-term   investing strategy -- not just because a billionaire did it   first.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Raging Bull: Buffett’s Berkshire Almost Quadrupled Its Stake In Apple Inc. (AAPL);2/16/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWarren Buffett is ultra-bullish onApple Inc.(AAPL), as he nearly quadrupled his holdings in thestock.makeArticleAd();By the end of the year, Buffett'sBerkshire Hathaway Inc.(BRK.A,BRK.B)held about 57 million shares, an increase from 15 million shares in the third quarter, according to a regulatory filing on Tuesday. The firm's total stake in the iPhone maker stood at approximately $6.6 billion as of December 31.Buffett Bullish on AppleApple shares, which have rallied 42% in the last 12 months, surged to a new high on Tuesday and continued to move ahead on Wednesday, exhibiting rising interest among investors. If Buffett did not make any alteration to his positions since the end of the last year, it is now worth a whopping $7.7 billion, according to Forbes.Buffett's rising interest in Apple does come as a surprise, considering his reluctance towards technology stocks, which, according to him, are outside his zone of competence, except forInternational Business Machines Corp.(IBM).However, Berkshire has etched its name among the top 10 biggest Apple investors after accumulating the stock recently, according toReuters.Thomas Russo, who oversees $11 billion in assets at Gardner Russo & Gardner in Lancaster, told Reuters, ""I'm stunned to see the size of that Apple position. It's quite possible that Warren woke up and began to understand the virtues of Apple that he had been neglecting or, like with Precision Castparts, Todd or Ted had an affinity for Apple that sparked interest from Warren.""Buffett started building a position in thestocklast year when the market turned bearish on it due to sluggish iPhone sales and declining revenue. He added 9.8 million shares worth $1.1 billion.7 Tech Stocks With Explosive Growth PotentialBuffett is Upbeat on Airlines, TooBuffett's Berkshire is also upbeat about airlines, beefing up its position inAmerican Airlines Group Inc(AAL),Delta Airlines, Inc.(DAL) andUnited Continental Holdings Inc(UAL).Additionally, it added a stake inSouthwest Airlines Co(LUV) during the quarter, according to regulatory filings. Buffett has also taken a position inMonsanto Company(MON) andSirius XM Holdings Inc(SIRI), notesForbes.On the other hand, Berkshire has reduced its holdings inWal-Mart Stores Inc(WMT) from 12.9 million shares to 1.4 million shares.Buffett, who is not so bullish on technology companies, is currently the second richest person in the world, with a net worth of about $74.9 billion, according to Forbes' estimate.Major Berkshire investments such asWells Fargo & Co(WFC),The Coca-Cola Co(KO) and IBM are Buffett's ideas, but the 86-year-old has given more responsibility to Todd Combs and Ted Weschler in recent years.Year to date, AAPL stock is up almost 17%, while in the last six months, it is up almost 25%.The postBuffett's Berkshire Almost Quadrupled Its Stake In Apple Inc.appeared first onValueWalk.Many academics claim investing is a ""random walk.""

3 Reasons Warren Buffett Is Buying Apple Stock;2/16/2017;"Warren Buffett nearly quadrupled his stake in Apple (symbolAAPL, $135.51) during the last three months of 2016, according to the latest 13-F filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission by Buffett's holding company, Berkshire HathawayBRK.B. The big investment is already looking like a shrewd move. Apple shares are setting record highs this week and are up 17% so far in 2017. With a market capitalization, or share price times total shares outstanding, of $711 billion, Apple is the most valuable public company in the world. (Prices as of February 15.)See Also:11 Dow Stocks Owned by Warren BuffettBerkshire initially bought shares in Apple in early 2016. The purchase gained a good deal of attention at the time. Apart from IBM, a stock Buffett followed for more than 50 years before finally buying in 2011, he had shown little interest in technology stocks. The disclosure about the new stake in Apple, made last May, coincided with a period when Apple's shares were on the downswing and sparked wide speculation that Buffett was calling a bottom in the stock.It's not always easy to decipher the reasoning behind Buffett's buying and selling. The Oracle of Omaha tends to be tight-lipped about his investments. It's made all the harder by the fact that changes to Berkshire's holdings aren't revealed to the public until weeks or even months after the fact in quarterly SEC filings. But for buy-and-hold investors, Berkshire's big move into Apple - 57.4 million shares as of December 31, up from 15.2 million at the end of September - can be instructive nonetheless. Here are three reasons we think Warren Buffett is buyingApple stock.makeArticleAd();His Top Guys Told Him to BuyBuffett doesn't deserve all the credit for Berkshire's investment in Apple. In fact, he might deserve little of it. David Kass, a professor at the University of Maryland's Robert H. Smith School of Business who studies Buffett and is a Berkshire shareholder, suspects that one or both of Buffett's chief stock-picking lieutenants, Ted Weschler and Todd Combs, are behind the move into Apple. Still, Apple does have some of the attributes Buffett has said he likes: It's a leader in its market, and it has a ton of cash at its disposal ($246 billion in cash and securities as of the end of 2016).The Price Was RightAt $135, Apple shares are much pricier today than they were when Berkshire was amassing its stake. During 2016, the stock price ranged from a low of $90 to a high of $118. Still, UBS analysts say the price gain is deserved due in large part to the high retention rates among iPhone buyers. UBS rates Apple stock a ""buy,"" but picking up shares all at once at peak prices isn't necessarily the best approach. Instead, take a cue from Buffett and spread out your buying to take advantage of any periodic dips.The Debut of iPhone 8This year marks the 10th anniversary of the iPhone, and company watchers expect big things when Apple unveils the latest version of the mobile device. Apple sold 5% fewer iPhones year-over-year during the three months that ended in September, the final quarter of its 2016 fiscal year. But year-over-year sales growth returned in the December quarter, up 5%, and the new iPhone 8 is expected to rejuvenate demand later this year. (A release date hasn't been announced.) Analysts believe the new smartphone will set sales records as it prompts users to upgrade from older iPhones.Take the Quiz:How Well Do You Really Know Warren Buffett?"

Does Warren Buffett Still Matter to Value Investors?;2/15/2017;"(1:00) - What Is Warren Buffett's Current Holdings?(5:05) - Should You Be Buying What Warren Buffett Buys?(9:40) - Tracey's Top Three Picks: Investing Ideas(13:00) - Episode SummaryWelcome to Episode #30 of the Value Investor PodcastAs the editor of theValue Investor portfolio service, I love looking at value stocks. Every week, I share some of my top value investing tips and stock picks.You might have noticed that the big hedge fund and money managers had to file their Form 13F filings, which disclose what stocks they bought and sold in the fourth quarter of 2016, by February 15.While it's backward looking by at least 45 days, it still shines a window into what some of the biggest names in the investing business are doing with their money.One of the biggest of them all is Warren Buffett. Among value investors, he is considered to be the greatest value investor of all time. I know some investors who are so in awe, they try and mimic his stock moves in their own portfolios.What were those moves in the fourth quarter?Berkshire added three new positions:1.      Southwest Airlines (LUV) which is the fourth airline Berkshire has bought in the last 2 quarters. He also owns Delta, America and United. I'm not a big fan of this trade. You can check out theValue Investor Podcastwhere I discussed Buffett's third quarter airline buys, why I didn't like those 3 buys, and whether or not the airlines were true value stocks.Listen here>>.2.     Monsanto (MON) which is just 0.57% of his portfolio.3.     Sirius XM Holdings (SIRI), which is also a small position overall, at just 0.5% of the portfolio.Buffett also added to his Apple (AAPL) position which is now among the top 10 and is about 4.5% of the portfolio. I've discussed how Apple is a value stock in prior podcasts so this larger position isn't a surprise.Concentration at the TopHis largest position continues to be The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC), which is about 19.2% of his portfolio. It is hitting new 52-week highs in 2017.Although the portfolio was holding 46 stocks in the fourth quarter, it was heavily concentrated in the top 10 holdings. Those accounted for over 80% of the portfolio.The top 5 positions, many which have been held for years, read like a who's who of the Dow Industrials.What Happens When You Have Too Much CashThanks to a record stock market, the market value of Berkshire's holdings has soared to about $150 billion. That's a lot of cash to invest. The Kraft Heinz position alone, in the fourth quarter, was worth $28 billion.But this also means that Buffett and his managers are stuck in a one-trick pony. They basically have to buy big cap stocks. The only way to get small cap exposure is by buying the company outright.Buffett has talked, in the past, about wishing he were in his 40s again and investing. He would have a smaller portfolio and a longer time horizon in which to invest. These are ideal conditions.Seize the Opportunity to Go SmallBuffett may be stuck with the large caps, but you don't have to be.I've talked about small cap value, and how historically it is one of the best investments in the entire stock market (yes, it beats growth over long periods).You can listen to theValue Investor PodcastonSmall Caps for the Winto get all the details on why value investors should be in small caps.Listen here>>While buying airlines and Apple aren't awful strategies, for those of us who don't have $100 billion to invest, there are so many other intriguing options.3 Small Cap Value Stocks to Consider Instead of Buffett's   Picks1.      Gray TelevisionGTNhas a forward P/E of 13.9 and a market cap of $821 million.2.     Malibu BoatsMBUUhas a forward P/E of 14.5 and a market cap of just $400 million. But, alas, it's not based in Malibu. It's headquartered in Tennessee.3.     Republic Bancorp Inc.RBCAAis one of the many community banks that are publicly traded. It's headquartered in Louisville, Kentucky. It has a forward P/E of 14.5 and a market cap of about $750 million. It pays a dividend, currently yielding 2.4%.While Warren Buffett still fascinates value investors, I'm urging you to look beyond his moves in the Berkshire portfolio.There are plenty of hidden value opportunities among the small caps that Buffett, no matter how much he wants to get in, just can't buy.But you can.Find out what else I think about Berkshire Hathaway's fourth quarter stock moves and value stocks in this week's podcast.Subscribe to our podcast below:Souncloud:TuneIn:iTunesWant more value investing insights?Check out my weekly Value Investor service to receive more in-depth analysis on value companies and see which stocks I think are the best bargains now.It holds between 20 and 25 value stocks for the long haul.Click here to learn more.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Universal Display's Next Stop: $100?;2/15/2017;"Shares ofUniversal Display(NASDAQ: OLED) enjoyed a strong day today, closing out trading   with 5% gains. The stock had risen as much as 10% during trading   before giving back some of those gains. The driver behind today's   move was Susquehanna initiating coverage on the organic   light-emitting diode (OLED) pioneer with a ""positive"" rating   alongside an ambitious $100 price target. That valuation   represents meaningful upside relative to the all-time high of   around $74 set last August, a level flirted with today.What will it take for Universal Display to hit three-digit   prices?OLED adoption may (finally) accelerateAnalyst Mehdi Hosseini says that OLED adoption within the   smartphone and TV markets is ""set to accelerate."" However, this   is a storyline that's been repeated for years, as investors   patiently await for the adoption curve to spike. To be clear,   OLED adoptionislikely to spike meaningfully, and when it does it will translate   into major upside for Universal Display's financials, but the   timing is what's so hard to predict.makeArticleAd();Emitter materials that are used in OLED displays. Image     source: Universal Display.Universal Display also enjoys a fairly easy competitive   environment, as the company lacks any meaningful rivals that can   compete in terms of intellectual property and patent licensing.   Hosseini notes that Universal Display recently announced that it   was doubling its manufacturing capacity for the OLED materials   that it subsequently resells to customers. The company said last   week that it would invest $15 million inPPG's(NYSE: PPG) manufacturing facility in Ohio to double capacity   for Universal Display's proprietary UniversalPHOLED   phosphorescent emitter products. The expansion is set to be   completed by the third quarter.The analyst believes that Universal Display's business of   materials sales combined with patent licensing (which is not   unlike acertain mobile chip giant) gives it an enviable position once OLED adoption accelerates   further. OLED penetration of the smartphone market is currently a   mere 16%, according to Hosseini's estimates, but this is expected   to rise to around 30% by 2019. The TV market moves much slower,   and OLED penetration in TVs is a minuscule 1%, although this may   triple to 3% over the same time frame.Flexible designs are expected to be the key driver of   adoption, as manufacturers can explore a wide range of innovative   new use cases that are currently unavailable with traditional LCD   displays.In other newsSeparately,Bloombergreported yesterday thatApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is in negotiations with China-based BOE Technology   Group to provide OLED displays. BOE is already planning on   investing nearly $15 billion to build two AMOLED manufacturing   facilities in Sichuan. That could potentially supplement the $4.3   billion supply agreement that Apple has reportedly inked with   frenemySamsung, one of the largest proponents to date of OLED displays.Apple's adoption of OLED is very much baked into broader   expectations of OLED adoption throughout various markets, given   the Mac maker's unique ability to bring new technologies to the   mainstream. By the looks of it, Apple appears intent on reserving   OLED displays for itsmost expensive iPhonemodel due to the added costs associated with OLED panels. As   costs naturally come down over time, you can expect that the   company would bring OLED to the rest of the lineup, much like it   has done with other technologies.More than most, Universal Display investors recognize that   patience is a virtue, and that patience is finally paying   off.10 stocks we like better than Universal     DisplayWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Tech Stock Roundup: INTC Analyst Day, AAPL Smartphone Lead;2/15/2017;"Intel Analyst DayIntel's analyst day was mostly about the growing importance of the data center business as a driver of both revenue growth and margin pressure. Within data center, the enterprise and government segment is expected to be the weakest due to delays related to the transition from on-premises to public cloud-based deployment, which is why it will grow a mere 2%.But this will be strongly supplemented with 15%+ growth in cloud service provider (helped by TAM expansion and higher prices) and 10%+ growth in communications service provider revenues. The much larger CPU portion will post a 6% CAGR dropping from 87% of revenue in 2017 to 75% in 2021. Non CPU parts of the data center business will record a 30% CAGR during the same time period.Intel put out some rather convincing charts showing the artificial intelligence opportunity and Intel's position within it along with its significance for total server revenue. Accordingly, in 2016, AI was just 7% of revenue, of which 60% was classic machine learning with the remainder being deep learning.In 2010, when NVIDIANVDAentered the market, Intel HPC accounted for 93% of the market with NVIDIA making up the rest. NVIDIA grew strongly for the next two years but Xeon Phi has started taking back share again. As a result, in 2016, Intel's combined technologies gained back some market to end at 84%.Because of the huge opportunity, Intel will be devoting more R&D dollars to strengthen this business and its new chips starting from the last iteration of 10nm will be first available to its data center customers. Increasing costs will therefore have a negative impact on this business over the next few years.In 2017, management expects revenue growth in the low single digit range, a gross margin of around 63% and EPS of around $2.80. DCG will be up high single digits, CCG will be down mid single-digits, NSG up 20%+, IoTG up 10%+ and PSG up mid-single-digits.Intel expects to spend $12 billion (+/- $500 million) on capex this year, of which $2.5 billion will be on memory. But capacity additions will account for most of the rest.Management also pointed to future opportunities: memory ($100 billion TAM), autonomous vehicles in 2025 ($10 billion TAM) and 5G connected devices (more than $50 billion TAM).Intel's U.S. Factory Endears It to TrumpIntel CEO Brian Krzanich met with Trump and promised to invest an additional $7 billion in an Arizona factory it originally started building back in 2011. The plant will employ 3K high-tech high-wage employees and it is estimated that indirect jobs relating to it will take employment up by about 10K.Intel has struggled to take the x86 architecture below 10nm, which could be partially responsible for construction being put on hold. Intel is one of the few technology companies that stuck with its U.S. fabs as a matter of policy even when many of its peers moved offshore. Intel owns leading edge IP that it wouldn't want to outsource to places where IP laws are suspect.The CEO made no bones about the fact that conducive tax and regulatory measures had prompted the company's decision to complete the investment now, so he may have eked out some concessions from Trump.Apple Sells More Smartphones Than SamsungAccording to IDC data published Feb 1, Apple shipped slightly more smartphones in the holiday quarter than Samsung, despite the fact that iPhone shipments were down for the first time in 2016. This is the first time in five years that the company gained the top spot.Apple's success was attributed to the iPhone 7 and Samsung's Galaxy Note 7 fiasco. Samsung said the exploding phones cost it $3 billion in sales. Overall smartphones grew just 2.3% in 2016 compared to 10.4% the previous year. Apple's 4.7% growth rate was better than the industry. Samsung shipments declined 5.2%.IDC expects the market to rebound this year, in part because of expectations of a landmark phone from Apple and renewed demand in the Middle East and Latin America, which didn't have a good 2016. Separately, Canaccord Genuity has said that while Apple accounted for just 18% of the smartphone market last quarter, it took 92% of the profits.Google Selling Its Satellite CompanyGoogle has agreed to sell its high-resolution satellite imaging business, Terra Bella, to imaging startup Planet Labs for somewhere between $300 and $500 million. Planet Labs has a number of medium resolution satellites that will complement the ones it has acquired, according to Planet.Google is not quitting the mapping business and a long-term agreement to license the technology back from Planet is reportedly a part of the deal. This may not be a hugely profitable deal for Google given that it originally acquired Terra Bella for $500 million in 2014 when the company was called Skybox. But it may be a part of the realignment of its business units and goals under CFO Ruth Porat.CompanyLast WeekLast  6 MonthsAAPL+2.36%+22.12%FB+2.45%+7.12%GOOGL+1.79%+3.68%MSFT+0.50%+10.23%INTC-3.23%+0.86%CSCO+0.61%+1.61%AMZN+2.12%+7.94%Other stories you might have missed-CorporateApple Submits on Aussie Bank Boycott: Apple has submitted a statement to the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission (ACCC) charging the top four banks (Commonwealth Bank of Australia, National Australia Bank Ltd., Westpac Banking Corp. and Bendigo & Adelaide Bank Ltd) in Australia of delaying the expansion of Apple Pay, which could prove detrimental to smaller card issuers while reducing options for consumers.The banks, which are in the process of developing their own mobile technology, are seeking to bargain collectively with Apple to have their apps included in Apple Pay. Apple would rather have card issuers add their cards to its wallet and have the banks pay for inclusion. Apple said it won't give the banks a ""free ride"" while the banks responded saying Apple's assertion was ""incorrect and unsupported."" In its draft ruling, the ACCC denied the banks' request. The final ruling is expected in March.Apple Hires Away Amazon Executive: Timothy D. Twerdahl, who formerly headed Amazon's Fire TV unit as its general manager and director, has now joined Apple as its VP in charge of marketing Apple TV. Pete Distad who previously played that role will now help Apple negotiate content deals. Twerdahl has vast experience in streaming: before his four-year stint at Amazon he was VP of consumer devices at Roku and before that, he was an executive at Netflix. The executive changes seem to indicate that Apple is finally going to make some bold moves in this business, which hasn't really done that well versus competitors.Facebook VR Demo Stations Shutting Down: Facebook (FB) is closing down around 200 of its 500 VR demo stations at Best Buy stores. It appears that the Oculus wasn't as much of a success as anticipated because few people came in for a demo at all and store attendants said that frequent software issues with the headsets made them unsellable. But the headsets aren't going out of circulation. The stores will continue to sell them and Facebook has promised that there will be pop up and other stores that will continue with the demos. The program started with 50 stores that were later expanded to 500 in August last year.Facebook Hires MTV Executive: Facebook is very serious about content, video content in particular. On the earnings call, Zuckerberg mentioned how video was the next big thing just like mobile. So it has done everything possible to help share videos of every description and host Facebook Live streams. But in order to increase differentiation and the price of ads running adjacent to these videos,Facebook needs a little bit more. And now it's apparent that that is original content. The company has snapped up Mina Lefevre, who was in charge of scripted programming at MTV to head up its content development efforts. She will report to Ricky Van Veen, co-founder of CollegeHumor.Legal/RegulatoryMicrosoft Battles with Govt Spying: The court hasn't allowed the government's request to throw out a MicrosoftMSFTlawsuit, in which it contended that the Electronic Communications Privacy Act violates the first amendment. The act allows the government to issue gag orders when asking for data housed on third-party servers like those owned by Microsoft.The Justice Department had asked the government to dismiss the lawsuit saying that it needed to keep investigations confidential so as not to alarm possible wrong-doers and that they did eventually get to know when charges were filed. Microsoft succeeded in convincing the judge that this affected its ability to do business. But the court held that Microsoft couldn't assert constitutional rights for someone else, so it couldn't talk on behalf of its customers.Google Wants Warrants for Govt Snooping: Google's head of information security Richard Salgado visited senators to speed up the passage of a bill that has previously been endorsed by the House of Representatives. The bill seeks to do away with one clause of the current law that allows the government to obtain access emails that are more than 180 days old without a warrant. Google would like the law to be applicable for all emails irrespective of age. The bill was in the hands of Senator Jeff Sessions prior to the elections, when he was elevated to the position of Attorney General by President Trump.New Technology/ProductsCisco Announces First SIG: CiscoCSCOhas created a new Secure Internet Gateway (SIG) in the cloud that will allow on-field or mobile enterprise users to connect securely to the Internet even when they aren't connected through VPN. Cisco's solution is called Umbrella. Umbrella can identify which SaaS apps are being used and enforce policies to block risky or inappropriate apps; analyze over 100 billion internet requests every day, correlating with over 11 billion historical events to identify patterns, detect anomalies, and create models to automatically uncover attacker infrastructure being staged for the next threat; and other security checks through machine learning, Cisco Talos threat intelligence, and Cisco Advanced Malware Protection (AMP).Microsoft Extends Support to Cloud Customers: Boston Consulting Group says that while IP lawsuits have increased 22% over the last five years, patent trolls - companies that don't have a business but acquire patents to benefit from litigation - increased patent acquisitions by 35%. It is perhaps these trends that prompted Microsoft to expand its patent protection coverage to all users of its Azure infrastructure. Microsoft will give customers one of its own patents to help them deal with the litigation. Microsoft also expanded its indemnification program under which it provides funds or legal counsel to help customers defend themselves.M&A and CollaborationsNES and Google Have a Deal: Nashville Electric Service has withdrawn its lawsuit against the Metro Council and telecom companies filed last October, after Google promised to indemnify it against liabilities that may arise out of Metro's One Touch Make Ready policy. The current law requires that when a new provider's line is added to a utility pole, each existing provider is required to move its line, resulting in needless delay and disruption on the sidewalk.The new policy allows one person to move the poles, thus making the process more efficient. Existing providers like AT&T and Comcast object to the law on the grounds that Metro is not authorized to make the law, which is a matter for the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The deal is significant because NES owns 80% of the utility poles in Nashville and Google is likely to succeed because the action promotes competition in the market and can force incumbents to match Google Fiber's high-speed services.Some NumbersMicrosoft Azure Price Cuts: Microsoft has taken the lead in announcing price cuts for its Azure Virtual Machines. The company said that compute-optimized F Series instances would cost its customers up to 24% less, while A1 Basic instances would drop by up to 61%. Azure HotBlock Blob Storage and Cool Block Blob Storage costs are also down. Suntrust analyst Kunal Madhukar expects Amazon to follow soon, as price cuts are ""business as usual"" for cloud infrastructure service providers.Amazon Payments: Amazon's payments service called Pay With Amazon, which allows people to check out quickly using the details saved on Amazon says that the service now has 33 million users, 32% of which access it with mobile devices. Pay With Amazon had 23 million users last April. Amazon's alliances with companies like PrestaShop, Shopify and Future Shop have brought more users over the past few months.Zacks' Top 10 Stocks for 2017In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2017?Who wouldn't?

Yet breadth remains mixed, with pockets of strength in financials and Big Tech stocks, but areas of weakness including energy and utilities.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockFor the first time in years, it's a stock picker's market as cross asset correlations diminish and stocks stop rising and falling in unison - based, as it was, largely on what the Federal Reserve was doing - and instead shifting based on the individual dynamics of each industry and sector group. In the lingo of the trade: We're seeing a return of investing based on idiosyncratic catalysts instead of ""macro"" investing.For those looking for new trading ideas, the latest batch of 13F filings reveals what moves hedge funds are making (with a 45-day delay since the end of the last quarter).7 Stocks to Sell or Short Before the Bears StrikeSuperficially, let's take a look at what Warren Buffett'sBerkshire Hathaway Inc.(NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B) has been up to:Warren Buffett Stocks: Southwest Airlines (LUV)Position:New BuySouthwest Airlines Co(NYSE:LUV) shares are launching to fresh highs on Wednesday thanks to wordBuffett is building a stakein the discount air carrier.The stock is rising up and out of a four-year sideways crawl that's largely relegated shares to the upper-$40s.

Buffett Signals Shift on Long-Standing Tech Stance With Big 4Q Apple Bet;2/15/2017;"Berkshire Hathaway Inc. increased its bet on Apple by more than 200% in the fourth quarter, upping its position in the iPhone maker to a whopping $6.6 billion as of December 31. Warren Buffett's big move came just ahead of a major 2016 turnaround for Apple. The big Apple bet also signals a shift for Buffett, who has stayed away from tech stocks for decades.Berkshire held 57.4 million Apple shares at the end of 2016. Those shares would now be worth roughly$7.74 billion based on the tech giant's Tuesday closing. BerkshireBRK.Ashares rose 0.8% yesterday, and it is up 0.10% after early Wednesday trading to $250,673.Apple Inc.AAPLshares rose 1.3% Tuesday to $135.02. Ahead of the Berkshire announcement, the tech company onMonday closed at an all-time highas anticipation for the 10thanniversary iPhone continues to grow.Apple's stock is up 15% since the beginning of 2017.  Now, on the back of Buffett's faith and its own growth, Apple looks poised to build on its already stellar 2017.The tech giant took a bit of dive when its first quarter 2016 earnings report showed iPhone sales fell year-over-year for the first time in the smartphone's nearly 10-year history. Berkshirefirst announced it invested in Apple in May 2016, around the same timeApple stockhad hit a two-year low.Ted Weschler and Todd Combs,Buffett's right-hand men, pushed for the first Apple play. Apple shares rose nearly 4% the day Berkshire's initial stake was made public. And Apple's stock has been on the rise ever since.Buffet and Berkshire had previouslystayed away from technology companiesbecause Buffett was not as familiar with the space. But Weschler and Combs, who are in line to take over all of Berkshire's investments when Buffett steps down, seem to have convinced the ""Oracle of Omaha"" that Apple is a solid investment.Berkshire's big Apple bet came along with news that itmade major investmentsin Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV), American Airlines Group, Inc. (AAL), Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL) and United Continental Holdings, Inc. (UAL) in the fourth quarter. Yet another signal that Berkshire is moving outside of its comfort zone, as Buffett had a decades-long stance that airlines were money-losers.It is no secret that Buffett and Berkshire love to invest long-term. Buffett has famously said, ""our favorite holding period is forever."" And this must come as great news for Apple.However, since 1992,only two of Berkshire's ten biggest investments have remained, Coca-ColaKOand Wells FargoWFC. But the company now owns a third, GEICO. Berkshire's market value has grown by 2,300% since '92 when the Omaha, Nebraska-based company first began to skyrocket into the behemoth it is today.Still, even if Berkshire doesn't actually hold a company forever, it bets on companies it thinks have staying power. Apple has once again reached an elusive $700 billion market value, after becoming the first publicly traded U.S. company to do so in February 2015. And Berkshire now owns over 1% of Apple.Stocks that Aren't in the News. Yet.You are invited to download the full, up-to-the-minute list of 220 Zacks Rank #1 """"Strong Buys"""" free of charge.

Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock Could Win Big With ‘Windows Cloud’;2/15/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsNot long ago,Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) perfected the art of the big reveal. New Apple product announcements would be shrouded in mystery for weeks, and then the late Steve Jobs would get up on a stage and wow consumers and investors alike with the first-ever iPhone, the first-ever iPad or the first-ever iPod. AAPL stock would get an automatic 10% to 15% bump in the days that followed. CouldMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) have a similarly secretive catalyst in its so-called Windows Cloud product?makeArticleAd();Source:Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified)Windows Cloud is a mysterious operating system that was revealed via leaks, prompting a ""nothing to share"" response from Microsoft last week.What Is the Windows Cloud?A couple websites posted screen shots of Microsoft's yet-to-be-announced operating system, which would only run Windows Store apps designed to run on both desktop computers and mobile devices. The thought is that the Windows Cloud would supplement, not replace, the company's Windows 10 platform, which is only 18 months old.The Windows Cloud is already being viewed as Microsoft's answer toAlphabet Inc's(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Chrome OS. And by utilizing only its own apps, the platform could have a security advantage over Chrome, which uses non-native apps. That could position Windows 10 as a more appealing option to public institutions like schools, where protecting students' computers from outside apps or games can be difficult.Not much else is known about the Windows Cloud platform. And that's probably how Microsoft likes it. Although Wall Street didn't immediately embrace the top-secret new product by snatching up MSFT stock in droves, the real test will be when the company actually does its big Windows Cloud reveal. Will the platform impress enough to have an AAPL-like effect on Microsoft stock?7 Dividend Stocks Rewarding Shareholders With a RaiseClick to EnlargeFirst, let's look at how MSFT stock has been behaving lately.There was  big spike in MSFT stock last month has since been followed by a sharp retreat; however, the stock is still hovering above its 25- and 50-day moving averages, as well as two-month support in the $62-range.What you don't see is any kind of Microsoft stock price movement in the days since the Windows Cloud leak occurred. That means investors aren't quite sure exactly what the Windows Cloud is and how it could affect MSFT's business, which is why there has been no sudden rush to buy MSFT.If more details leak out, that could potentially move the needle. For now, though, the Windows Cloud remains a relative mystery that likely has Wall Street more confused than excited.MSFT Stock Is Strong Even Without the 'Cloud'In the meantime, Microsoft looks good on its own merits. MSFT stock is up nearly 30% in the last year, nearly 50% in the last two years, still trades at less than 20 times forward earnings estimates, and is expected to grow earnings-per-share by more than 6% this year and more than 9% next year. Sprinkle in a potential game changer in the Windows Cloud, and there's no reason to suspect Microsoft stock is going to suddenly backtrack.On the contrary, the recent mini-dip is a prime buying opportunity, so long as it holds above those short-term moving averages. I'd buy MSFT stock right here, with the hope that a future Windows Cloud unveiling could spark a quick run-up the way Apple's secret product launches used to.As of this writing, Chris Fraley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 Super-Safe Dividend Growth Stocks to Buy Today7 Tech Stocks That Could Implode at Any MinuteThe postMicrosoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock Could Win Big With 'Windows Cloud'appeared first onInvestorPlace."

Should I Buy Qualcomm, Inc. (QCOM) Stock? 3 Pros, 3 Cons;2/15/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsA few years ago,Qualcomm, Inc.(NASDAQ:QCOM) seemed like a sure bet. Hey, with its CDMA platform, the company was at the heart of the fast-growing mobile market. QCOM stock was essentially a cash machine.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockYet lately the company has been in a slump. Since the summer of 2014, QCOM stock has lost about a third of its value. Of course, the tech industry is chock-full of examples of darlings that fell on hard times.And yes, it can take time to get back into growth mode again. Although, when this happens, the gains can certainly be standout. Just look at the comeback ofMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT), which is up about 90% during the past couple years.So in the case of Qualcomm stock, is there much upside or should investors remain wary? Let's take a look at three pros and three cons and find out:QCOM Stock ProsMobile Powerhouse:The roots of QCOM go back to the mid-1980s, when seven engineers teamed up to capitalize on the mobile industry. At first they focused on technologies to provide location-based services and messaging for the trucking industry. Then after a few years, QCOM would go big - that is, develop a standard, called CDMA, which would allow for better cellular communications.The business model was to license the technology, which would mean getting aggressive with patents. While success was not immediate, QCOM was determined to make CDMA a critical part of the mobile industry. And of course, this wager ultimately paid off handsomely. For example, just some of QCOM's marquee customers includeApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL),Samsung Electronics(OTCMKTS:SSNLF),XiaomiandAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG).7 Tech Stocks That Could Implode at Any MinuteMegatrends:The mobile market is expected to grow at a nice pace, which should mean continued demand for Qualcomm offerings. There are currently about 4 billion 3G/4G connections using CMDA systems and this is expected to increase to6.4 billion by 2020. But there should also be substantial benefits from the emergence of 5G technologies. These will allow for better performance for the Internet of Things (IoT), wearables, autonomous vehicles, virtual reality and even remote medical procedures. While QCOM's R&D investments will be vital for capitalizing on these trends, the company has also ramped upped its deal-making. No doubt, the most notable example of this isthe proposed $38 billion acquisitionofNXP Semiconductors NV(NASDAQ:NXPI). Note that the company is one of the top players in the fast-growing market for self-driving cars.Financials:Granted, QCOM's revenues are not growing at a fast clip. In the latest quarter, there was a4% increase. But then again, the company is fairly mature, so it can be tough to churn out strong growth. Yet QCOM remains a highly profitable business, with fiscal 2016 net income coming to$6.7 billion. The company has also been shareholder friendly. Keep in mind that the current yield is at an attractive 4%.QCOM Stock ConsLitigation:Because of the extensive patent portfolio, QCOM collects a hefty royalty from most sales of smartphones across the globe - even for those devices that do not even include any of the technology! So as should be no surprise, there is much concern about this. The Chinese governmentchallenged QCOM's practices, and the case was eventually settled.But there are other major cases that are in the early stages, such as in South Korea, Europe and the U.S. Oh, and Apple has also launchedseveral major lawsuits against QCOM. The company certainly has tremendous resources to wage a brutal fight. Now as with any legal dispute, it is tough to predict the outcome. But if QCOM ultimately loses, then its core business model will be in jeopardy and this could certainly have horrendous consequences. Keep in mind that the company gets about80% of its pretax profits from licensing.Trump Factor:A key part of the president's agenda is to get tough against China, which Trump considers a currency manipulator. He has also called for stiff tariffs and sanctions. So if there is a trade war, the impact is likely to be adverse to U.S.-based companies that derives substantial revenues from China. Let's face it, the government is cracking down, favoring domestic-based operators over foreign ones. All in all, this poses material risks for QCOM. After all, about57% of revenuescome from China and Hong Kong.Competition:It is intense. Some of the tough rivals includeBroadcom Ltd(NASDAQ:AVGO) andTexas Instruments Incorporated(NASDAQ:TXN). There are also a variety of startups that are gunning for the mobile market. YetIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) may ultimately be the biggest threat to Qualcomm. Last year, Intel entered an agreement with Apple to supply chips. Before this, QCOM was thesole supplier.In other words, if the legal battles go against the company, Intel may be in a better position to snag more and more business.Bottom Line on QCOM StockWith the recent slide in Qualcomm stock, the valuation is definitely attractive. Consider that the forward price-to-earnings multiple is only about 11.5X.3 Reasons Sears Holdings Corp (SHLD) Stock Is Heading to ZeroBut this may not matter much. For the most part, the impact of the litigation is far from clear - and of course, legal disputes often move at a glacial pace. So in light of this, it's probably best to avoid QCOM stock for now.Tom Taulli runs the InvestorPlace blogIPO Playbookand also has his own free iOS app to estimate your tax refund, which is atPathwayTax.com.Follow him on Twitter at@ttaulli.

Should I Buy General Motors Company (GM) Stock? 3 Pros, 3 Cons;2/15/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsGeneral Motors Company(NYSE:GM) has certainly made a tremendous comeback since 2008, after having to declare bankruptcy. But there has been little for investors to cheer about. Back in late 2010, the company pulled off its IPO at $33 a share. But now GM stock is at only $37.20.makeArticleAd();Source:William Oliver via Flickr (Modified)To put things into perspective,InvestorPlace.com'sDana Blankenhorn has noted: ""Ever since the 2008 crash and government bailout, General Motors stock has been treated like dirt. No matter what GM does, it can't get out of first gear.""I actually think this is an understatement!Of course, Wall Street can be inexplicable. Yet eventually investors will recognize the value. Hey, this has happened with other stocks that languished for a long time, such asMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT), right?OK then, so would GM stock be a good play right now? Or should investors hold off? Well, to see, let's take a look at 3 pros and cons on General Motors:3 Pros On GM StockMomentum: For the past two years, General Motors has posted record earnings, net revenues, EBITDA and free cash flows. As forlast year, revenues increased by 9.2% to $166.4 billion and free cash flows came to $6.9 billion, up $4.7 billion from the previous year.7 Tech Stocks That Could Implode at Any MinuteThen again, General Motors has continued to pump out popular cars, with global sales at 10 million (making the company the No. 3 player). A big part of this has been the continued success in North America. But of course, China remains a major factor as well. Last year GM reported3.87 million car sales in the country. Keep in mind that the company sells more in China than any country, including the U.S.But GM has also been judicious with discounts and promotions. For the most part, GM is focused on making sure it makes profits, not just on increasing marketshare.Innovation: One of the hottest categories in technology is the auto industry, as seen with the efforts with operators likeAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG),Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) andTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA). The good news is that GM has been ramping up its investments. To this end, the company made a $500 million investment inLyft(a top ride-sharing startup) as well as a $1 billion acquisition ofCruise Automation(a developer of autonomous car systems).Already there are signs that GM is getting traction. For example, the company is testing over 40 autonomous Bolt EVs. But there are also some other innovations, like Maven. This is a mobile platform that allows a person to search and reserve a car and unlock it with a smartphone. According toGM: ""With more than 25 million customers around the world projected to use some form of shared mobility by 2020, Maven is a key element of our strategy to changing ownership models in the automotive industry.""It's important to note that GM has the advantage of leveraging its experience with OnStar, which has been around for two decades. In fact, during this time, the system has logged about1.5 billion customer interactions.Yield & Valuation: GM has certainly been shareholder friendly. Last year, the company returned a hefty $4.8 billion - in a combination of share buybacks and dividends. In fact, GM stock has a nice yield of 4.1%.But the valuation is also attractive. Consider that the forward price-to-earnings ratio is at a lowly 6.1X. True, this may be deserved for a company that is showing declining growth. But as for General Motors, the company expects to increase the top line for 2017.In other words, the stock does look like a great value play right now.3 Cons on GM StockCompetition: The environment is brutal. And with more dealmaking, things will only get more intense. An example of this is the alliance ofRenault SAandNissan Motor Co Ltd (ADR)(OTCMKTS:NSANY) - which also involved the purchase of a large stake inMitsubishi Motors. With this, the companies were able to realize significant cost savings and also hit a global sales number of nearly 10 million last year.Although, accordingFiat SpA(ADR)(OTCMKTS:FIATY) CEO Sergio Marchionne, an automaker may need to reach levels of15 million cars sold annually to be competitive! The reason is that R&D will inevitably increase because of the enormous costs of new technologies.As a result, a company like GM may have little choice but to look for a similar alliance or a transformative acquisition, which would definitely be risky and expensive.Politics: The election of Donald Trump is a wild card for the auto industry. On the one hand, there are potential positives, such as with lower corporate tax rates and less onerous regulations.But these may not offset the issues with Trump's anti-trade bent. If there is a border tax, this could hurt GM because of its substantial production in Mexico. Actually, about 20% of light production is in the country. So if there is a border tax, it could mean higher prices in the U.S. - and yes, lower sales. According to theWall Street Journal: ""Even a more modest border tax under consideration would wipe out a quarter of GM's regional profit.""Global Issues:While the markets in China and North America have been robust for GM, there has been much softness in many other areas, such as in Europe and South America. Granted, there are signs of improvement - but the progress has been fairly slow. For example, in South America, GM has been able to cut back on the losses. But there was still $374 million in red ink last year.As for Europe, the growth has been sluggish across the continent. It also does not help that England has enacted the Brexit, which has caused a lot of uncertainty. As a result, GM lost $300 million in Europe last year and it appears there will not be break-even until 2018. To put things into perspective, the company has not seen a profit in the region since 2000!Bottom Line On GM StockPerhaps the biggest issue facing GM stock is the uncertainty regarding Trump's trade actions. Although, given the importance of the auto industry to the US economy, it does seem reasonable that any moves will likely be taken with care. Besides, General Motors CEO Mary Barra has been savvy to meet with Trump several times already.Gas Up With Chesapeake Energy Corporation (CHK) StockIn the meantime, she is doing a great job managing the core operations of the company. Note that there will be 18 new or refreshed models for five main brands in 2017, up from 13 last year. And yes, Barra has been aggressive with investments in new technologies.OK, so is GM stock a good buy right now? I think so, especially given the rock-bottom valuation.Tom Taulli runs the InvestorPlace blogIPO Playbookand also has his own free iOS app to estimate your tax refund, which is atPathwayTax.com.Follow him on Twitter at@ttaulli.

Universal Display Stock Upgraded: What You Need to Know;2/15/2017;"It's been three full months since reports thatApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) would be adding organic light-emitting diode   (OLED) displays to only one of its three new iPhone 8 models sent   shares of OLED specialistUniversal Display(NASDAQ: OLED) stock tumbling 5% in a day. But this week, the   momentum is reversing.On Tuesday, news broke that Apple has gone ahead and   signed a licensing deal withSamsungto order OLED displays for its iPhones. While the rumor doesn't   extend to whether Apple will be putting OLED displays in all   models of the iPhone 8 or just one, investors are taking the bait   either way. Yesterday,Apple stockhit a new all-time intraday high of $135.09 -- and it's pulling   Universal Display stock up alongside it.makeArticleAd();Here are three things you need to know about that.OLED screens -- and OLED stock -- are in focus today. Image     source: Getty Images.1. Susquehanna hails the newsIt's well-known thatUniversal Display is a supplierof OLED technology and OLED materials to Samsung -- which we now   know will in turn supply OLED screens to Apple. So naturally,   Universal Display shares shot 3.6% higher in Tuesday trading, and   were up a further 4% on Wednesday morning. Helping to keep   the momentum train moving was a new initiation of coverage on the   stock from Susquehanna. As reported onStreetInsider.comaround about midnight last night, Susquehanna has initiated   coverage of Universal Display stock with a ""positive"" rating and   a big, round price target of $100.2. Stay tuned for more newsSusquehanna's new rating implies a one-year profit potential   of nearly 50% on Universal Display stock, which currently sells   for just $67 and change. That's a big return for just one year's   investment, and we'll get our first clue as to whether it's a   realistic hope next week.On Thursday, Feb. 23, Universal Display plans to release its   financial results for fiscal Q4 and full-year 2016.3. What analysts predictHere's what Wall Street analysts are telling investors to   expect from that report: Profit growth of 8%, from $0.39 per   share earned a year ago to $0.42 in profits for Q4 2016. And   sales growth of only 10%, with $68.6 million in quarterly sales   expected.If these modest numbers seem like pretty slim reeds to be   supporting Susquehanna's expectation of a 50% surge in stock   price at Universal Display -- well, they may be. Based on its   most recent reported results, Universal Display stock currently   sells for nearly 79 times trailing earnings, and 46 times   trailing free cash flow. But these numbers could be shrinking   soon, as Universal Display's sales (and earnings) increase to   meet the new demand for OLED smartphone screens.According to data fromS&P Global Market Intelligence, analysts are looking for Universal Display stock to earn only   $0.88 for fiscal 2016 as a whole. But that number is expected to   jump 40% to $1.23 in fiscal 2017, then rise to $2.08 in 2018, and   $2.80 in 2019. Put it all together, and forecasts currently call   for a compound annual earnings growth rate of 47%.What it means for investorsAnd I think you'll agree --ifUniversal Display can hit the numbers Wall Street is laying out   for it, then 47% annualized growth should be sufficient to   support a stock selling for 46 times trailing free cash flow.Whether Universal Display stock can hit and maintain   Susquehanna's new $100 target price though, and the even richer   valuation that implies, is anybody's guess. It probably depends a   lot on whether Universal Display can both achieve the growth   rates Wall Street is already expecting -- and then keep those   rates growing further.10 stocks we like better than Universal     DisplayWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

5 High-Tech Cash Cows Yielding Up To 6%;2/15/2017;"By Brett OwensThe technology sector has long been the growth investor's best   friend, with tomorrow's innovations fueling the breakneck gains   necessary to generate big price returns. Traditionally there   hasn't been much to interest us dividend investors - until   now.Some tech companies have finally grown up. And while their   profit growth has slowed, their shareholder returns have actually   accelerated. These companies literally make more money than they   know what to do with - so they are increasingly dishing it back   as dividends.Here are five tech titans with big cash flows paying yields up   to 6%.makeArticleAd();Qualcomm (QCOM)Dividend Yield:4%Qualcomm (QCOM)has wandered its way back into 4% yield territory, but right now,   the wireless technology specialist is in extremely choppy   waters.QCOM shares have eaten 20%-plus losses since mid-January after   Apple (AAPL) filed suit against the company, and the Federal Trade   Commission filed charges against QCOM, with Apple mentioned by   name in the complaint. The series of antitrust complaints put   into jeopardy Qualcomm's extremely high margins, garnered from   licensing out its telecommunications technologies from a hoard of   patents.The company has already been slapped with an $853 million fine   from South Korean regulators over similar antitrust concerns, and   the company has been facing similar charges on the European   front.These legal woes threaten more than just the business model.   They also will have regulators looking even more closely at the   firm's $38 billion deal to purchaseNXP Semiconductors (NXPI), prompting Nomura to downgrade Qualcomm in January.It's unfortunate, because Qualcomm has been a serial dividend   raiser that still had plenty of ceiling with a 65% payout   ratio.Could Qualcomm's (QCOM) Dividend Generosity Be in Peril?QCOM might be a playground for speculators banking on a big   pop if the Apple, FTC and international legal action starts   turning in Qualcomm's favor, but for right now, this is not a   long-term dividend buy-and-hold play.NVE Corp (NVEC)Dividend Yield:5.3%NVE Corp (NVEC)isn't a particularly new company - it was founded in 1989 and   went public in 2000 - but its spintronics nanotechnology has been   gaining in popularity for decades, and currently has the stock   sniffing at all-time highs.Spintronics, according to the company, ""utilizes electron spin   rather than electron charge to acquire, store and transmit   information."" The technology has a wide range of uses. For   instance, in Q3, the U.S. Army awarded NVE Corp a small $141,000   contract for ""new ultra-fast spintronic radar detectors and   spectrum analyzers based on arrays of metallic or metal/insulator   nano-scale magnetic diodes.""However, the stock's rise doesn't match up with the   fundamentals, which include years of fairly stagnant top and   bottom lines. But the real issue is the dividend, which doesn't   seem to add up. NVEC pays out $1 quarterly, yet earned just $2.53   last year, and is expected to bring in $2.76 and $2.73 in profits   over the next two years. On an annual basis, dividends have   outstripped operational cash flow over the past couple years,   too.NVE Corp (NVEC) Might Be Reaching a PlateauNothing here screams imminent collapse, but this doesn't look   like a particularly secure payout, and if anything, hikes to the   dividend seem unlikely. Plus, a forward P/E in the high 20s and   prices near all-time highs signal that now would be a terrible   time to speculate.Seagate Technology (STX)Dividend Yield:5.5%Seagate Technology (STX)is a longtime maker of hard disk drives, solid state drives and   other electronic data storage solutions. It also has been the   source of heartburn for investors, who enjoyed 600% gains from   mid-2011 through 2015, then watched the bottom fall out by 70%   through mid-2016.Since then, STX has logged a 130% rebound to reach its current   price around $46.The one constant over that time has been a rapidly improved   dividend that surged from 18 cents to the current 63-cent payout   - a 250% increase that has shares yielding well more than 5% even   as shares continue to run hot.Looking forward, the company's improved profitability means   the dividend is safe and likely has room for improvement.   Analysts are tracking earnings of $4.49 per share this year and   $4.55 next, which puts the company's payout ratio at a   comfortable 55%.But growth seems almost entirely out of the picture. Revenues   have been on the decline since 2012, and the top line is expected   to slip in each of the next two years - all of this mirroring the   shrinking PC market that Seagate feeds off.Seagate's (STX) Dividends Compensate for a No-Growth StorySeagate should continue to be a considerable source of income   going forward, and may yield well more than the 5.5% it currently   boasts. Any additional capital gains from here would simply be   gravy ... but don't bet the farm on them.Iron Mountain (IRM)Dividend Yield:6%Data storage real estate investment trustIron Mountain (IRM)has been pointed in the same general direction - up - ever since   its 1996 initial public offering, but the going over the past few   years has been simply nauseating. In just the past year's worth   of trading alone, IRM has registered a 55% up-leg, a 25% dive and   a 16% rebound.Still, if you're willing to close your eyes and wait out the   roller coaster,IRM can be a fruitful investment.While Iron Mountain offers a number of digital services,   including cloud backup and data management, it also provides   actual physical records storage, shredding and even business   solutions. In other words, it provides legacy physical services   in a niche that few companies want to compete in, and it has its   hands in the growing digital storage cookie jar.The company reorganized as a REIT in 2014, and that began Iron   Mountain's transformation into a full-blown dividend powerhouse.   The company's most recent 48.5-cent payout is an 80% improvement   over its last quarterly distribution from its pre-REIT life. And   IRM's substantial yield has powered the majority of the stock's   returns over the past few years.Iron Mountain (IRM) Keeps Cranking Out     DividendsIron Mountain's financials are as temperamental as the share   price, with revenues and earnings vacillating from year to year.   But the pure income potential makes IRM worth it.Nokia (NOK)Dividend Yield:6%Nokia (NOK)is no longer the fine purveyor of seemingly invincible cellular   phones, but instead plies its trade in telecommunications   infrastructure and, like Qualcomm, licensing out its expansive   set of technology patents.However, Nokia has come up against a few walls.Nokia, which previously went to war with Apple over patent   infringement, is swinging at the Cupertino tech giant again over   a set of 32 tech patents. As a result, management says roughly   150 million euros' worth of patents are off the table for   2017.That's a shorter-term problem that could rectify itself in a   year. More troubling for Nokia is weakness in the wireless market   that has led to a significant downturn in revenues that didn't   get any better in 2016, sliding 10% year-over-year.Nokia's annual dividend, while generous at a roughly 6% yield,   has been on a longer-term decline as well.Nokia (NOK) Pays a Lot, But Is Paying LessNokia's annual dividend isn't nearly as consistent as typical   American quarterly dividends, which even in leaner times tend to   at least remain constant. Between that and an absence of growth,   there's no reason to chase yield here.The Best 7% Dividends for 2017It's tempting to fish for high yields in technology for the   simple sake of diversifying your income portfolio. But if you   overextend your reach for yield at the cost of growth, you could   be dooming your nest egg to years of retirement-killing   underperformance.You need the total package - dividends and growth and   resilience to any kind of headline if you want to keep growing   your wealth through what could be a shaky few years.You need the kinds ofdividend   stocksthat I've highlighted in my newFREEreport,""The Best 7% Dividends for 2017.""The Best 7% Dividends for 2017 features bulletproof yields of   7%, 8% ... even double digits that will provide the kind of   substantial income you need to get ahead over the long haul.

Free Profits on Groupon Inc (GRPN) Stock After Q4 Earnings;2/15/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsJim Cramer saidGroupon Inc(NASDAQ:GRPN) ""is a beast"" today on CNBC. All I know is that if I can find it on Groupon, that's where I'm buying it. The company isn't going anywhere, and that's enough for me to trade GRPN stock virtually worry-free.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockI could spend an hour dissecting the technical aspect of Groupon's price charts and poring over its fundamentals, but I won't. Why not? Because GRPN options give the flexibility to create income based on the aforementioned logic without even spending a penny out of pocket.I want to sell downside risk against levels I deem safe. This is, as I like to say, the equivalent of me selling someone else a losing lottery ticket. I'll collect the premium today, but it won't be mine to use until the contracts expire or I close the trade. If the price of GRPN stock stays above my level, I win the bet - and whoever bought the lottery ticket loses their price premium to me.How to Trade GRPN Stock HereThe bet:Sell a GRPN Jan 2018 $3 put for 40 cents to open. By selling naked puts, I commit to buying the stock at that price if it falls below it. So my breakeven price is $2.60 per share. I feel comfortable owning Groupon stock at $2.6 should the worst-case scenario happen. This would be close to the all-time low in the stock.9 Top Pharmaceutical Stocks to Buy for the DividendsA really bullish trader could spend the premium on buying calls to further make their position in GRPN stock even more bullish. That's not for me. I have more faith that buyers will step in to support the stock on dips than I am of chasing the rallies.Usually I like to balance my trades by selling opposing bearish risk, but in this case, I feel like I would be opening myself to undue risk. So I will leave this trade one-sided as written.I am not required to hold my trade through its expiration. I can close it at any time for partial gains or losses. Also, I could buy sacrifice May puts for 3 cents if I so feel too worried about a complete collapse.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director ofSellSpreads.com.

Will Apple, Inc. Really Double Its Services Business in 4 Years?;2/15/2017;"About a year ago,Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) began spending more time discussing its services   business during its quarterly earnings calls. It's pretty clear   why it decided to do so -- the services segment is the only   aspect of Apple's business that is still growing   consistently.On the first quarter earnings call last month, Apple CEO Tim   Cook announced an ambitious goal of doubling the company's   services revenue in the next four years. That's a big reason whyApple stockhas rallied more than 10% in the past few weeks, reaching a new   all-time high.makeArticleAd();Apple YTD Stock Performance, data byYCharts.Plenty of analysts and other pundits areskeptical that it will be feasibleto double the services business in four years, barring a big   acquisition. But here are three reasons why doubling the services   business might not be so hard after all.Services growth is acceleratingFirst, the services segment's growth trajectory is better than   it seems. For Q1 of fiscal 2017, Apple reported an 18% year over   year increase in services revenue, down from 26% growth a year   earlier.These figures make it seem like Apple's services growth is   already slowing. Considering that Apple needs to grow its   services revenue at a 19% compound annual rate to double it in   four years, this would be an ominous sign.However, in the first quarter of fiscal 2016, Apple benefited   from a one-time $548 million gain related to a patent   infringement lawsuit. Excluding that patent revenue, Apple's   services revenue grew only 15% in Q1 2016, but surged 30% year   over year last quarter. Thus, Apple doesn't even need to maintain   its recent services growth rate to hit its target.The App Store is gaining scaleA second factor working in Apple's favor is that the App Store   has recently become the largest contributor to Apple's services   revenue.App sales have been growing at a fast clip for many years, but   Apple only reports its net revenue from the App Store. The   portion of App Store sales that goes to developers -- which   ranges from 70%-85% -- doesn't show up in Apple's financial   statements. Apple earns an extremely high profit margin on App   Store revenue due to this accounting policy, but the growth of   this revenue stream hasn't been very material until recently.Wall Street analyst Toni Sacconaghi estimates that Apple's net   App Store revenue reached $7.3 billion in the 2016 fiscal year   that ended last September. That would make it the largest piece   of Apple's services segment, ahead of iTunes, which faces secular   revenue declines.Furthermore, the App Store continues to grow at a phenomenal   pace. Last month, Apple reported that developers' earnings rose   more than 40% year over year during 2016. The pace of growth is   sure to slow over time, but App Store revenue is on a trajectory   to more than double in the next four years, providing a good   chunk of the services revenue growth Apple is targeting.The iPhone Upgrade Program could lift AppleCare revenueGrowth of the iPhone Upgrade Program is a third factor that   could contribute to increases in Apple's services revenue. For as   little as $32.41/month, this program allows customers to get a   new iPhone every year by trading in their old one. Purchases   under the iPhone Upgrade Program include AppleCare+ enhanced   warranty coverage, which is worth $129.The iPhone Upgrade Program is boosting AppleCare+ revenue.     Image source: Apple.Many iPhone fans have already enrolled in the iPhone Upgrade   Program, but there's still plenty of room for growth. Apple could   potentially expand the program to more countries. It could also   consider creating similar programs for other devices like the   Apple Watch.These Apple-operated upgrade programs can drive significant   services revenue growth because AppleCare+ is part of the bundle.   Very few of these customers would be buying AppleCare+ if it were   still sold separately.A big reason for optimismApple's services business produced more than $24 billion of   revenue in fiscal 2016, up from less than $20 billion a year   earlier. This allowed it to surpass both the iPad and Mac product   lines to become Apple's second-largest segment by revenue.Even if Apple misses its target of doubling its services   revenue by 2020, it will certainly get a meaningful amount of   revenue growth from that segment. With strong services growth   ensuring that Apple's non-iPhone revenue will rise consistently   in the years ahead, Apple will be well positioned to return to   strong earnings growth as the next iPhone sales cycle heats   up.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Take a Bite Out of Apple with These ETFs;2/15/2017;"The technology sector has been on fire this year thanks to a deluge of upbeat earnings reports and improving fundamentals that have sent many stocks to multi-year highs. Among these, a noteworthy stock is the technology giant AppleAAPL, which has regained its momentum after seeing the worst decline in years (Technology ETFs Hitting All-Time High).makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');The stock is once again a darling of investors and surged to all-time intraday high of $135.09 a share, breaking its record of $134.54 a share set in April 2015. The rally came following the blockbuster fiscal first-quarter earnings report. The excitement surrounding the new iPhone 8 slated to release later this year is also acting as a major catalyst to share price improvement.In particular, Apple has risen about 11.3% since its earnings announcement on January 31.Peek Into Q1 EarningsEarnings per share came in at $3.36, easily trumping the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.22 and improving 2.4% from year-ago earnings. Revenues increased 3.3% year over year to a record $78.4 billion and beat our estimate of $76.9 billion. With this, the technology giant returned to revenue growth after three quarters of decline.Apple set all-time revenue records for iPhone, Services, Mac, and Apple Watch in the fiscal first quarter. It sold 78.3 million iPhones, up 5% year over year and well ahead of analyst expectations of 77.3 million units. This resulted in iPhone revenues of $54.4 billion and accounted for 69.4% of total revenue. Sales of Mac desktop computers returned to growth with increase of 1% in unit and 7% in revenue while unit sales for iPad declined 19% year over year.Meanwhile, service revenue, which includes digital music, Apple Pay, cloud storage and apps, grew 18% year over year to $7.2 billion led by record customer activity on the App Store and accounted for 9.2% of total revenue (read:Dow ETF Tops Asset Flow: 5 Stocks Behind The Surge).For the second quarter of fiscal 2017, the ubiquitous gadget-maker forecasts revenues in the range of $51.5 billion to $53.5 billion.Key Highlights of The iPhone 8Since Apple completed its tenth anniversary of iPhone, the hype surrounding the upcoming iPhone 8 is greater than the previous launches. This is because the new iPhone is expected to come with unique and efficient technology. Among others, the next-generation iPhone 8 is rumored to have an iris-scanner, which is the biggest highlight of the upcoming iPhone models.The 5-inch model with full-glass design will likely feature an OLED display and support wireless charging. The teaming up of Apple with the Wireless Power ConsortiumWPC, the governing body of the Qi charging standard justifies rumors of its wireless charging feature (read:iPhone 8 Rumors: Will Apple Use Long-Distance Charging From Energous?).Further, Apple's CEO Tim Cook sparked speculation of the augmented reality feature in the new iPhone 8. These upgraded features would provide solid resurgence in revenue growth.Analysts UpgradeDriven by impressive results, most analysts are bracing for a big jump in stock price and thusraised their target priceon Apple immediately after the earnings release. Goldman also raised the price target on February 13 citing that the expected release of iPhone 8 would be a game changer for the technology giant with the 3D sensor technology embedded in it. This suggests that the company is on a solid growth trajectory.According to the analysts polled by Zacks, Apple has an average target price of $137.10 with more than 77% of them having a Strong Buy or a Buy rating.Other FactorsApple is expected to get a boost under Trump administration's tax policies on foreign cash repatriation. The company looks to increase dividends and buybacks rather than invest in U.S. factories and jobs if Trump cuts corporate tax rates. As a result, Apple is expected to generate ROE of 33%. Additionally, UBS' note released on Monday estimating that the market is undervaluing Apple's services business has propelled the stock to new highs (see:all the Technology ETFs here).Apple currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and a VGM Style Score of A. Further, it has a solid ZacksIndustryRank in the top 37%, indicating smooth trading in the days ahead.ETFs to Add in Your PortfolioGiven the bullish trend, we have highlighted six ETFs with heavy exposure to this tech giant for investors seeking to bet on the stock with a much lower riskiShares Dow Jones US Technology ETFIYWThis ETF tracks the Dow Jones US Technology Index, giving investors exposure to 138 technology stocks.

But FB was missing out on the video action when members put down their smartphones to fire up the big screen in their living room. Not any longer. The company announced it's releasing a new Facebook video app for TV. The app will soon roll out to two of the most popular set-top streaming boxes.makeArticleAd();Source: FacebookYesterday, FB made the announcement that it will bereleasing a new Facebook video app for TV.This will be an app that's available for some of the most popular set-top streaming boxes and Smart TVs.

Stock Market News for February 15, 2017;2/15/2017;"Benchmarks sealed their fourth consecutive record highs on Tuesday after Fed Chair Janet Yellen indicated that a rate hike could occur sooner than expected. Following Yellen's statements, banks rallied strongly following optimism about a higher interest rate regime. Apple also notched up yet another record high. Indicators of business optimism and inflation also registered good readings during the day, leading to further optimism among investors at large.For a look at the issues currently facing the markets, make sure to read today'sAhead of Wall Streetarticle.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) increased 0.5%, to close at 20,504.41. The S&P 500 rose 0.4% to close at 2,337.58. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 5,782.57, gaining 0.3%. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) decreased 1.2% to settle at 10.94. A total of around 6.7 billion shares were traded Friday, matching the last 20-session average. Advancers outpaced declining stocks on the NYSE. For 50% stocks that advanced, 46% declined.What Boosted The Benchmarks?Fed Chair Janet Yellen's first day testimony before Congress solidified the views that the Fed is more hawkish now. Yellen left the possibility of a rate hike open as early as the central bank's next policy meeting in March on Feb 14. Citing an improving economy and solid labor market, she noted that waiting too long to hike rates would be unwise since it might hamper the broader financial markets. She reiterated some of the language from the Fed's last policy meeting that adopted a more hawkish outlook, while indicating that she is concerned about the possibility of holding off rate hike for too long.Yellen expects gradual rate increases to occur amid a modestly expanding economy and inflation that should touch the Fed's desired target rate of 2% in the near term. She said that ""at our upcoming meetings, the Fed will evaluate whether employment and inflation are continuing to evolve in line with…expectations, in which case a further adjustment of the federal funds rate would likely be appropriate"".As Yellen signaled that the central bank could gradually raise interest rates sooner rather than later, financial stocks lead gains for the day, with the Financial Select Sector SPDR (XLF) increasing 1.2% on Feb 14. The financial sector has rallied more than 20% since the November election, and 4.2% this month alone.Bank stocks jumped after Yellen's hawkish comments on interest rates. Higher longer-term interest rates can boost bank profits, as they increase the spread between what banks earn by funding longer-term assets, such as loans, with shorter-term liabilities. Bank of America (BAC) rose 2.8% on Feb 14 to its best levels since Nov 2008, while Wells Fargo (WFC), Citigroup (C) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) went up 1.6%, 1.5% and 1.6%, respectively, hitting all-time highs.Meanwhile, shares of Apple Inc. (AAPL) increased to another intraday record level of $135.09, before closing with a gain of 1.3% at its highest ever closing price of $135.02. The company possesses a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Gas Up With Chesapeake Energy Corporation (CHK) Stock;2/15/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsGood news fromChesapeake Energy Corporation(NYSE:CHK) has this trader thinking it's time for investors to ""spend"" a little on CHK stock. But before you do, take some of the speculation out of owning shares using a ""married put"" strategy to hedge your bet.makeArticleAd();Natural gas outfit Chesapeake delivered some good news to Wall Street Tuesday morning, announcing it will spend $1.9 billion to $2.5 billion in 2017. The new capex data narrows prior guidance and provides clarity for CHK stock investors.Clarity-seeking investors should also be impressed withChesapeake's production forecast.The company's now sees 5% to 15% annual growth through 2020. The more upbeat narrative is a far cry from a year ago when Chesapeake's survival as an ongoing business was in question both off and on the CHK stock price chart.Chesapeake's rebounding prospects have been supported by asset sales, debt reduction and some re-inflation of oil and gas prices over the past twelve months after hitting decade lows. And according to CEO Doug Lawler, ""The execution of our 2017 capital program will position Chesapeake for significant production and earnings growth and cash flow neutrality in 2018.""With an improving picture for Chesapeake on the price chart, it's time investors consider their own capital investment and spend a little something on CHK stock.CHK Stock Daily ChartClick to EnlargeI'm a sucker for stocks that appear to be making all the right moves technically, but still maintain a flaw or two. The daily chart of CHK illustrates a bullish setup with a nice risk-to-reward. The situation is too good to be true.Over the past year CHK stock has gone from volatile short-covering style reactions, up and down, and into a more developed and stable uptrend.7 Tech Stocks That Could Implode at Any MinuteWith last week's low, shares have pulled back 28% from an early and sudden December double-top high to successfully test the longer-term 200-day simple moving average and up-channel support lines.Traders using the chart for guidance are risking roughly 50 cents on the downside to see $1.50 to perhaps as much as $3 upside if CHK can resume its rally and retest the prior highs or possibly reach the upper channel line.Chesapeake Energy Married PutGiven the favorable risk-to-reward situation on the CHK price chart, I like approaching CHK as a married put or synthetic long call. With earnings slated for late next week, the protected position with its open-ended upside makes all the more sense.Reviewing the Chesapeake options board, the April $6 married put for $6.78 is attractive. With shares at $6.42 this trader is paying 36 cents for more than two months of protection at a key low on the CHK chart.A trader that simply purchases CHK stock is of course, free to set a stop-loss at the $6 level and the strike of the protective put. But at the end of the day - and particularly with earnings in the picture - there's always the possibility for major slippage when it comes time to actually exit the position.Apple Inc. Stock Keeps Rising, Putting A Chokehold On Short-Sellers (AAPL)With the married put the trader is also initially leaving the upside open in an attempt to take advantage of a larger bullish reaction in CHK. If shares were to rally in front of the earnings event, I'd personally consider selling the April $8 call if it trades for 20 cents or greater versus a current market price of 12 cents.Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in any of the securities or their derivatives mentioned in this article.

Warren Buffett Nearly Quadrupled His Apple, Inc. Position Last Quarter;2/15/2017;"So much for that aversion to tech.The Oracle of Omaha made waves last year whenBerkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK-A) (NYSE: BRK-B) disclosed that it had picked up a   cool$1 billionworth ofApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) shares, enough to scoop up 9.8 million shares.   It's worth noting that this initial investment decision was not   made by Buffett himself, but rather one of his lieutenants.Berkshire then proceeded to buy an additional 5.4 million   shares in the second quarter of 2016, increasing its position to   15.2 million shares valued $1.5 billion at the time. There was no   reported change in the number of shares during the third quarter,   although Berkshire enjoyed some gains as shares rose. Berkshire   has just filed itsForm 13Ffor the fourth quarter, and it nearly quadrupled its Apple   position.makeArticleAd();Data source: SEC filings. Chart by author.Berkshire is now sitting on 57.4 million shares of the Mac   maker, valued at $6.6 billion at the end of last year. Not many   investors can say this, but Buffett now has a 1% stake in Apple,   which is a pretty tall order when we're talking about a $700   billion company. You can count on one hand the number of   institutional investors that have a stake greater than or equal   to Buffett's, and most of those are fund families that aggregate   reported holdings across different funds.Apple was a big chunk of Buffett's buying spreeIn an interview with Charlie Rose a few weeks back, Buffett   noted that Berkshire had acquired $12 billion in common stock in   the wake of the election, which represented a significant   increase in buying activity. In contrast, Berkshire bought   approximately $10 billion worth of equities throughallof 2015.Apple Store Third Street Promenade. Image source: Apple.While some of that $12 billion was seemingly purchased after   the new year, and we don't know what prices Berkshire was buying   Apple at, it's safe to say that a good chunk of that money was   allocated to the Mac maker. Apple's average share price during   the fourth quarter was right around $113, which would translate   into $4.8 billion based on the additional 42.1 million shares   purchased during the quarter.Of course, Buffett is far from a market timer, but with shares   currently trading at all-time highs, the increased position is   already faring quite well. Shares are already up 17% year to   date, thanks in part to a record fourth-quarter earnings   release.AAPLdata byYCharts.Cash flow is one of Buffett's favorite investing metrics,   particularly compared to figures like net income, which are   subject to more qualitative judgments from management and more   prone to manipulation in general. Apple has cash flow in spades,   and currently has thelargest cash positionof any company ever. The tech titan generated over $65 billion in   operating cash flow in 2016, of which $52 billion was free cash   flow.If Buffett thinks Apple is undervalued enough to nearly   quadruple Berkshire's position, he's probably on to   something.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

15 Big Changes Since the S&P 500 Market Cap Doubled to $20 Trillion;2/15/2017;"Milestones seem to be falling at a breakneck pace over the   past couple of years. On Monday, Feb. 13, the broad-basedS&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) closed at an all-time record high, and in the   process, the aggregate value of S&P 500 companies crossed the   $20 trillion threshold for the first time ever. For Wall Street,   the milestone represents affirmation that the bull-market rally   is here to stay.However, it took quite some time for the S&P 500 to double   based on market cap from $10 trillion to $20 trillion - 19 years   -- given the dot-com bubble in 2000-2001, as well as the Great   Recession. Here are just some of the things that've changed over   those 19 years.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL)stock:In 1998, the technology giant was still nearly a decade from     introducing the world to the iPhone, and it controlled about     0.06% of the S&P 500's weighting. Today, at a better than     $700 billion market cap, Apple and its army of loyal customers     is responsible for about 3.5% of the S&P 500's     weighting.Gallon of gas:A gallon of gas would set you back $1.07 by the end of January     1998, whereas today the average gallon of gas costs $2.31.Image source: Getty Images.Price per ounce of gold:At the end of January 1998, you could pick up an ounce of gold     for $302.02. Today, that same ounce of gold will cost you about     $1,228.30.Price per ounce of silver:Toward the end of January 1998, an ounce of silver could be     purchased for just $6.22. As of today, that same silver ounce     is worth $17.94.Movie ticket price:Heading to the movies in 1998 would have cost an average of     $4.69 on an inflation-adjusted basis, compared with an     estimated $8.65 per ticket today.Median home price:If you were purchasing a home in January 1998, you were dealing     with a median home price of $148,000, according to the Census     Bureau. As of the third quarter of 2016, the median home prices     in the U.S. was up to $247,000.Unemployment rate:The unemployment picture is very similar, with the unemployment     rate in January 1998 (4.6%) coming in just below that of     January 2017 (4.8%).Image source: Disneyland.Disney World ticket price:Heading toDisney(NYSE: DIS) World in Florida in 1998 would have cost $39.75 per     adult, or $288 for an annual pass. Today, a regular ticket runs     $115, with an annual pass setting a consumer back $779. Mind     you, Disney just increased its theme-park ticket prices this     week.Wilshire 5000:The Wilshire 5000 market-cap-weighted index contained more than     7,500 companies as of July 1998, as private companies rushed to     meet investor demand and go public. By Dec. 31, 2016, there     were only 3,618 publicly traded companies in the Wilshire     5000.30-year fixed mortgage rate:At the beginning of January 1998, homebuyers would have been     dealing with an average 30-year mortgage rate of 6.99%. Today,     the 30-year rate is a more appealing 4.27%, perBankrate.One dozen eggs:Back in 1998, heading to the store for a dozen eggs would set     you back $1.09. As of December 2016, the price for a dozen eggs     had only risen to $1.38 (although that's down 50% from December     2015).Image source: Pixabay.Bacon price per pound:Back in 1998, a pound of sizzling bacon would set a consumer     back $2.96. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, a     pound of sliced bacon was selling for $5.10 in December     2016.National debt:All the way back in 1998, the federal debt totaled ""just"" shy     of $5.8 trillion. Within a matter of weeks, we're liable to     cross the $20 trillion federal debt threshold.Median household income:In 1998, median household income was $51,295, when adjusted for     inflation. By 2015, the latest data available from Census data,     median household income had risen to $55,775.U.S. postage stamp:A U.S. postage stamp increased to $0.33 in 1998, which     compares with the $0.47 consumers pay for postage stamps     today.Prices change, but one aspect remains quite     steadyA lot has changed over the past 19 years as the S&P 500's   market cap has doubled in value. Yet despite these big changes,   one factor remains firmly in place: Over time, the valuation of   the stock market, and of high-quality companies, tends to   increase.Image source: Getty Images.On average, the stock market returns about 7% per year, with   dividend reinvestment factored in. This would put the stock   market on track to double in value about once every decade.   Understand, this is just an average, and as we saw between 1998   and 2017, it took a bit longer. Then again, culling data can be   arbitrary. For example, the S&P 500 has risen more than   threefold since its lows in 2009. If you had regularly been   buying stocks without paying any attention to where the S&P   500 was, you'd likely have purchased companies that have   increased multiple times in value since 2009.According to data from Yardeni Research, the S&P 500 has   undergone 35 stock market corrections of at least 10% since 1950,   when rounded to the nearest whole number. In every single   instance, the stock-market correction was wiped out by a   bull-market rally. Sometimes it took weeks, months, and in rarer   cases a few years, but when all was said and done, patient   long-term investors were rewarded with a higher-marching stock   market.What's more, a study released by J.P. Morgan Asset Management   found that holding the S&P 500 between January 1988 and   November 2015 would have led to an average annualized return of   10.8%. However, missing just its 40 best days over this 27-year,   roughly 7,000-day period would have reduced your average annual   return to 2.9%!The data doesn't lie. Holding high-quality companies over the   long run, and buying companies at regular intervals, regardless   of where the S&P 500 or other indexes are valued, is a   winning strategy.10 stocks we like better than Wal-MartWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock   tip, it can pay to listen.

Warren Buffett's Huge Stake in Apple: What He May See In AAPL;2/15/2017;"Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A,BRK-B) have long been adverse to investing in technology companies. That mantra started to change in 2011, when Berkshire startedinvestingin IBM (IBM).Since then, his investment manager lieutenants, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, have added to Berkshire's investment portfolio, buying up stakes in technology companies, but never to the size and scope of the IBM investment, which was $11 billion at the time.Now, it looks as if Buffett is doing it again -- this time with Apple (AAPL).makeArticleAd();In a recently released SEC filing, Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway revealed it now owns a sizable stake in the Cupertino, Calif.-based tech giant. At the end of the fourth-quarter, it owned  57.4 million shares, up from 15.2 million shares in a previous filing. At current prices, the stake is worth just over $7 billion, likely making the stake with Buffett's approval, if not done himself.Without putting words into his mouth, the Apple stake is likely similar to IBM in Buffett's eyes, as the venerable iPhone maker is becoming a services company, one with steady revenue coming from dependable subscriptions.Buffett's investment isn't about what technology is the ""next big thing,"" whether augmented reality is asbigas Apple thinks it will be or whether Apple is really making a car or not. It's pure and simple economics and the attractiveness of the subscription model.In Apple's fiscal first-quarter, itgenerated$7.1 billion in Service revenue, from things like Apple Music, iTunes, the App Store, Apple Pay and more. It's the healthiest portion of Apple's business, one that's growing at 18% year-over-year. CEO Tim Cook hassaidthat Apple's Service business will be the size of a Fortune 500 company sometime this year, indicating that growth isn't slowing down anytime soon.Yes, Apple is still beholden to sales of the iPhone, iPad and the Mac for the majority of its revenue, but the Service business is slowly, but surely, making Apple's revenue smoother and less lumpier from a quarterly perceptive. Visible, growing revenue is worth significantly more than revenue from hardware that acts like a roller coaster, with ups and downs.All investors need to do is look at the earnings multiples for companies like Salesforce.com (CRM), Microsoft (MSFT) and others to see the positive impact. Companies that have enormous subscription-based revenue, which put off tremendous amounts of operating cash flow in a predictable manner are ultimately more valuable than ones that do not.The company has a goal of doubling its Service revenue by 2020, which is an admittedly large task. But with a user base of over 1 billion active devices, Apple should be able to continue to grow parts of its Service business, like Apple Music and the App Store, as it continues to add new features (namely, TV shows for Apple Music).It's likely we will hear more about Buffett's Apple stake in the days and weeks to come. If we do get commentary from the Oracle of Omaha himself, expect Services and predictable revenue to be a big part of the line of thinking.I know it would be for me."

Apple Inc. Stock Keeps Rising, Putting A Chokehold On Short-Sellers (AAPL);2/15/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsApple Inc.(AAPL) stock is choking short-sellers afterGoldman Sachs Group Inc(GS) boosted its price target 13%, pushing the iPhone maker's shares tonew highsagain and again.makeArticleAd();Analysts and investors are practically salivating over the yet-to-be revealed iPhone 8/ iPhone X, and they lapped up Apple management's comments about services revenue doubling over the next four years.Meanwhile, short interest in Apple stock rises along with the share price as bears bide their time and try to wait out the growing pain.GS's Apple Stock Target: $150 Per ShareIn a research note dated Feb. 13, Goldman Sachs analyst Simona Jankowski said sheboosted her price targeton Apple stock from $133 to $150 per share. She noted that it's looking more and more like 3D sensing technology will be in the iPhone 8 this year, based on data points from Lumentum. This technology paves the way for the inclusion of augmented reality features on the device, marking a ""significant step-up in innovation"" for this year.Her supply chain checks back up the other reports pointing to a third iPhone model with a massive 5.8-inch display being released this year. She sees starting prices of $649 and $769 for the 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch iPhone models for this year, which other analysts are calling the iPhone 7s and 7s Plus. Also like other reports from other sources, Jankowski's checks suggest that the third model, called the iPhone 8 or iPhone X, will be priced higher than the other two models. Some reports have pegged the starting price at orabove $1,000, although she didn't specify a starting price tag.The Goldman analyst's price target boost for Apple stock is based on a higher multiple of 16 times (versus 14 times previously) due to an expected acceleration in earnings growth over the next couple of years.Short-Sellers Burned by AAPL StockAfter touching a new record high on Monday, Apple stock hit another high on Tuesday and continued to climb, approaching $135 per share in the wake of Goldman's price target lift. Apple stock is now up by more than 16% year to date, and short-sellers are down more than $71 million, according to data from financial analytics firm S3 Partners.Apple Inc. Hits New All-Time Highs. What's Next?As is typical of short interest, the firm said interest in Apple stock was rising along with the stock price between 2009 and 2014 for risk management and hedging purposes in addition to simple short bets.However, over the last three years, short interest in Apple stock has been falling as the shares kept hitting new record highs, says S3.Last year, short interest averaged $6.04 billion and traded between $4.4 billion and $6.9 billion, although it spiked to $10 billion in late March amid the stock's lowest level in two years at $90.34. Short-sellers lost $432 million in total last year as Apple stock rose 9.93%.Short interest in the name is down this year, but S3 Partners says portfolio managers' losses on their $5.6 billion short or hedging position are much bigger. The firm said financing costs surpassed $2.1 million in the first six weeks of this year, but the mark to market P/L is a loss of $794.5 million.The shorts are down 14.26% year to date in total, net of financing.With all the pain, it's no surprise that few are just betting outright that Apple stock will fall. S3 said most currentshort interestin Apple stock is market-related portfolio heads or hedges for derivative securities. The firm added that core short interest in the name ranges from $4.5 billion to $7 billion, so in order to say there's ""an appreciable"" number of short-sellers betting on a share price decline, interest would have to trend past $7 billion.The postApple Stock Keeps Rising, Putting A Chokehold On Short-Sellersappeared first onValueWalk.Many academics claim investing is a ""random walk.""

Move Over China: India's the Best Place to Invest Right Now;2/14/2017;"(1:30) - Apple to begin iPhone manufacturing in India(6:15) - Tesla speculates opening the doors into India's   Market(9:15) - Internet Expansion   in India(13:35) - Amazon's Big Investment into India(21:30) - India's influencing infrastructure(25:25) - Stock Re-capWelcome to Episode #70 of the Zacks Market Edge Podcast.Every week, host and Zacks stock strategist, Tracey Ryniec, will be joined by guests to discuss the hottest investing topics in stocks, bonds and ETFs and how it impacts your life.In this episode, Tracey is joined by Neena Mishra, Zacks Director of ETF Research and also the editor ofZacks Income Investor.But she's not on the show this week to talk about ETFs or income stocks. No, she's joining Tracey to discuss a far more important topic: the investing opportunities in India.Neena just returned from a trip to India where she noticed that there was a lot more optimism about the economy.Prime Minister Modi has been trying to institute economic reforms to open up India's economy, which has been notoriously closed off to foreign investment. Given the developments over the last few years, it looks like he is succeeding.While many American technology and social media companies are shut out of China for various reasons, India has seemingly opened its doors. With 1.2 billion people, and growing, many companies would love to tap that consumer base.With one of the largest populations of Millennials in the world, and a growing middle class, 2017 could be the year of India.Tracey and Neena discuss 5 ways in which investors can invest in India's rising economic power, without even leaving the shores of the United States.5 Stocks to Play the Indian Growth Story1.AppleAAPLonly has 2% of India's smartphone market. Estimated at 300 million, and growing, that's just a small sliver of the market. But until 2017, it hasn't been able to open Apple retail stores in the country. Thanks to a deal to manufacture the phones in India, which will bring costs of the phones down for consumers, Apple could soon be tapping India's growing elite.2.TeslaTSLAappears to be poised to enter the India market after CEO Elon Musk tweeted out in February 2017 that it is looking to enter India in mid-2017. There are also rumors that a long-awaited Tesla Asia manufacturing plant may get the green light in India, instead of China. Stay tuned.3.FacebookFBhas long been shut out of the massive Chinese market, but that's not the case in India. One problem in India, however, has been the poor Internet infrastructure. There are just 250 million data subscribers, although that number is growing quickly. In 2016, Facebook tried to give away the Internet in India but was shot down by the government. However, data companies have been quickly expanding which is helping Facebook's reach. In the fourth quarter of last year, India was Facebook's fastest growing market.4.AmazonAMZNhas put the most on the line in India as it has already spent about $5 billion to expand its fulfillment centers and delivery service in the country. Amazon Prime has launched in 100 cities. 10% of India's population speaks English, which makes it the second largest English speaking country, after the United States, in the world. It's facing competition, however, from Alibaba and homegrown FlipKart and Snapdeal. But it has launched Amazon Video and a recent 3-day Great Indian Sale saw sales growth surge over 200% compared to a regular shopping day.5.NetflixNFLXhas an aggressive international expansion plan, and it includes India. In December 2016, just as Amazon Video launched, Netflix announced a partnership with Bollywood movie star and producer, Shah Rukh Khan. Right now, Neena says Netflix is charging around $10 a month for its streaming service. That is high for India. But, again, companies are looking at the growth potential.What else should you know about India and investing in its hot growth story in 2017?Find out the answers to this and more on this week's podcast.Zacks' Best Investment Ideas for Long-Term ProfitmakeArticleAd();Today you can gain access to long-term trades with double and triple-digit profit potential rarely available to the public.

Visa Checkout Is Growing Fast -- but Is That Enough?;2/14/2017;"Visa Inc(NYSE: V) investors certainly had reason to celebrate in the days   following its 2017 first-quarter results. The stock price popped   on the revenue and earnings beat and is now up 9% year to date.   Underlying business fundamentals also look strong. Net operating   revenue, adjusted net income, and earnings per share were all up   more than 20% year over year. More importantly, itsintegrationwith Visa Europe appears to be moving along smoothly and   efficiently.Image source: Visa Inc Newsroom.makeArticleAd();While Visa continues to show signs of growth, management knows   it cannot take this growth for granted. The competition in the   payments industry is too fierce for any company not constantly   innovating to flourish for long. During the conference call   following the quarterly earnings release, new CEO Al Kelly   identified six guiding pillars he believes are crucial to Visa's   foundation and future growth. The last of these pillars is   digital expansion, which Kelly believes is best represented by   Visa's heavy investment in Visa Checkout. Kelly said:E-commerce enabled by mobile and other form factors is a     significant opportunity. And we are definitely investing behind     it. As payments move from the physical to digital world, we're     leading the way in developing solutions for our clients, our     partners and consumers. One great example of this is Visa     Checkout. We now have over 18 million consumer accounts in 23     countries and over 1,500 financial institutional partners     participating around the world. More than 300,000 online     merchants have signed on to accept Visa Checkout, representing     $173 billion in addressable volume.Visa Checkout is the company's payment platform that allows   accountholders to store their credit card information and make   purchases from third-party retail websites. This allows consumers   to buy things online without having to enter their payment   information, a cumbersome process especially difficult from   mobile devices. Retailers love these types of solutions because   it makes the checkout process smoother and quicker, leading to   greater sales and lesscart abandonment.Visa Checkout's potent growthThe numbers Kelly cited for Visa Checkout's growth certainly   look impressive. The platform has grown its consumer accounts   80%, its financial institution partners by 150%, and online   merchants accepting the platform by 20% since last year's   first-quarter earnings report. That's some pretty strong   year-over-year growth.The Visa Checkout page on Pizza Hut's website. Image source:Visa Inc NewsroomNeedless to say, the company invested a lot into Visa Checkout   this past year, and it shows. In the 2016 fourth-quarter   conference call, former CEO Charlie Scharf said Visa had rolled   out a redesigned Visa Checkout experience to all worldwide   merchants making it easier for customers to sign up and complete   purchases with mobile devices. The company also opened the   platform to its card-issuing partners, allowing them to integrate   their own digital wallets into Visa Checkout. Judging by the   numbers, these efforts have yielded decent results.Is the growth enough to justify another digital wallet?Despite the heady growth, though, there still seem to be some   lingering questions in CEO Kelly's mind about whether the heavy   investments in resources and effort are worth it. Later in the   conference call, when answering a question from an analyst, he   expressed some of these doubts:My personal view is that there are too many wallets out     there. Consumers are not going to ultimately want to have 50     wallets. And we're not necessarily anxious just to be in the     wallet business per se, but we're anxious to be -- to take     advantage of us being a trusted acceptance mark in the payments     eco space and want to be able to make sure that we're taking a     leading position in establishing Visa as a trusted mark and as     an important partner to our issuers in terms of them trying to     establish as much volume as they can get in the digital     space.These misgivings are probably justified. While Visa Checkout   experienced significant growth to reach 18 million consumer   accounts,PayPal Holdings Inc.currently has almost 200 million active accounts and   accounted for more than 1.75 billion payment transactions last   quarter.Meanwhile,Amazon.com Inc.'s Amazon Payments recentlyannouncedit had 33 million customers who used its platform to make a   purchase, and that payment volume had doubled year over year. In   September,Apple Inc.announcedcustomers would be able to use Apple Pay to purchase products   online when using a Mac, iPad, or iPhone. Apple Pay also   experienced explosive annual growth, as CEO Tim Cook announced   transaction volume had grown by more than 500% year over year in   the company's 2017 first-quarter conference call.Doubts or not, Kelly knows Visa cannot just walk away from   hosting a digital wallet. In the quote above, he acknowledges   that the company's card-issuing banking partners want ""as much   volume as they can get in the digital space."" These banks are   ultimately Visa's real customers, and Visa cannot afford to lose   any simply because it doesn't want to invest in the space. For   this reason alone, it is well worth Visa's time and resources to   continue to innovate and market Visa Checkout. Whether the   platform will ever really catch on with the end consumer is   another matter entirely and is anybody's guess.10 stocks we like better than VisaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

iPhone 8 Rumors: Will Apple Use Long-Distance Charging From Energous?;2/14/2017;"Welcome to the newest Zacks exclusive podcast! On the very first episode of Zacks Tech Talk Tuesday, Content Writer Ryan McQueeney explores some of the prevailing theories surrounding the iPhone 8, including the rumor that Apple is teaming up with another company to deliver long-distance wireless charging in the upcoming phone.Tech Talk TuesdayBrought to you by the co-host of theZacks Friday Finish Line, Tech Talk Tuesday is a new biweekly podcast designed for all of the tech-crazed investors out there. The show will focus specifically on the hardware and software products that drive the sales of some of the world's biggest technology companies.In the world of tech investing, it is easy to get lost in the endless sea of market data. One can easily forget about what these companies are actually doing: innovating, inventing, and trying to change the word. Tech Talk Tuesday is here to remind us about the amazing technology of the present and the fascinating potential of the future.iPhone 8 RumorsFor the first Tech Talk Tuesday, the focus was planted squarely on the tech world's biggest name: Apple Inc.AAPL.Apple is celebrating the 10-year anniversary of its flagship iPhone line, and consumers are already expecting three new phones from the company in 2017. Apple will most likely deliver ""7s"" and ""7s Plus"" options in the first half of the year, with the iPhone 8 coming towards holiday season.Of course, this is just speculation at this point. But speculation is fun. Speculating about what Apple is going to do next is one of the most fun things ever. You literally never know exactly what the company is up to, but it is fascinating to compile the leaks, reports, and rumors.As for the iPhone 8, one of the main rumors so far is related to the inclusion of wireless charging technology in the phone. Wireless charging is an interesting concept, and current options rely on magnetic energy to charge, requiring users to place their device on some sort of compatible pad.Enter Energous CorporationWATT, an innovative wireless charging company that uses RF waves to charge. Energous promises ""long-distance"" wireless charging, and many people think the company could be teaming up with Apple to incorporate the tech in the iPhone 8.This week's episode explores the reality of Energous' involvement with the phone and raises some questions as to whether the company will ever be able to deliver the charging technology it claims to have.If you enjoy the episode, make sure to subscribe and leave a rating!

Apple at All-Time High: Poised for More Growth as Anticipation for Next iPhone Builds;2/14/2017;"In anticipation of its 10thanniversary iPhone, due out this spring, Apple Inc.AAPLlooks poised to build on its already stellar 2017. The tech giant closed Monday at an all-time high of $133.31 per share in after-hours trading, jumping 0.9%, and it is up to $134.19 after early Tuesday morning trading. Apple's stock is up 15% since the beginning of 2017.The company posted all-time high quarterly revenue of $78.4 billion in its first fiscal quarter of 2017, which ended December 31, 2016. Apple has once again reached an elusive $700 billion market value, after becoming the first publicly traded U.S. company to do so in February 2015. The $700 billion value places the company firmly at the top of the U.S. food chain, nearly $120 billion above GoogleGOOGL, now Alphabet.""We're thrilled to report that our holiday quarter results generated Apple's highest quarterly revenue ever, and broke multiple records along the way,"" Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a press release.""We sold more iPhones than ever before and set all-time revenue records for iPhone, Services, Mac and Apple Watch. Revenue from Services grew strongly over last year, led by record customer activity on the App Store, and we are very excited about the products in our pipeline.""The company's flagship product, the iPhone, was born on June 29, 2007. The transformative smartphone helped catapult Apple to where it is today.Now, nearly a decade later, details of the iPhone 8, or the iPhone X, a rumored name, might just pack enough new features to encourage a huge uptick in purchases. But more importantly, it could signal that Apple is once again making massive jumps in innovation, which the last few iPhones lacked.The normally measured Cook spoke recently about groundbreaking new plans, which could include augmented reality.Leaks about the upcoming iPhone have started to come out,and they are bold. Some of the ""supply chain"" leaks suggest Apple's new iPhone ""will change this industry deeply.""Speculation suggeststhe iPhone 8 could be made almost entirely of glass, charge wirelessly and come in three different sizes.It could also have an OLED screen, which would help boost battery life dramatically.Cook announced last month Apple's plan to double the company's $24.35 billion services business by 2021. The CEO also suggested upcoming tax reforms would allow the company to bring home cash held overseas to help bolster mergers and acquisitions.International sales accounted for 64% of Apple's first quarter revenue. This is massively important as the company tries to hold ground in highly competitive Asian markets, especially China, the world's largest smartphone market. Part of this growth is due to increased app purchases and streaming music subscriptions.Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc.,BRK.Ahas poured millions of dollars into Apple over the last year, which brings its stake to nearly $1.5 billion. The ""Wizard of Omaha"" backing a company is rarely a bad sign.However, iPad sales have leveled off, and the Apple Watch has not yet made the splash the company has hoped for. But the Apple Watch still claimed63% of the still new smartwatch marketin the fourth quarter. Its second-generation waterproof model could be bigger than the first.And still, Apple's iOS products are on track toreach nearly a trillion dollars in sales.The company's Beats Electronics brand, which it purchased for $3 billion in 2014, holds a lot of cachet in popular culture, including professional sports and music. And their new Airpod earbuds have potential to catch on quickly.An estimated 85% to 90% of iPhone users will buy another iPhone, according to UBS. There are currentlyover 600 million iPhonesbeing used worldwide, many of which are models 6 or lower. This means a lot of people could upgrade this year, especially with the introduction of iPhone X, its most game-changing phone in years.Which Stocks are Zacks Experts Talking About?makeArticleAd();Stocks in today's headlines may be tempting buys, but how would you like to peek behind the curtain to see all the best stocks Zacks' team of experts are recommending?

Apple, Inc.'s First 2 Original TV Shows Are Almost Here;2/14/2017;"Investors have known for quite some time thatApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) ispushing into original content, primarily as a way to differentiate its Apple Music service   from rival music streamers. Apple has been investing in a handful   of new TV shows that will be exclusive to Apple Music, and the   first two are almost here.The first is a reality TV series that focuses on apps and app   developers, calledPlanet of the Apps. Celebrity advisors Jessica Alba, Gwyneth Paltrow, Gary   Vaynerchuk, and will.i.am will offer to guide new developers   in an effort to win funding from prominent Silicon Valley venture   capital firm Lightspeed Venture Partners, which incidentally is   about to make a fortune on an app it funded years ago:Snap.Apple started casting for the show last summer, which is kind   of likeThe Voicemixed withShark Tankbut for apps. Speaking at the Code Media conference last night,   Apple services chief Eddy Cue said the show would debut in the   spring on Apple Music as well as through a dedicated app.   Episodes will be released in a linear fashion, one at a time   (sorry, binge watchers).makeArticleAd();The second isCarpool Karaoke, which is based on the popular segment of the same name fromThe Late Late Showwith James Corden. This one was already publicized, as no one can   forget CEO Tim Cook singing ""Sweet Home Alabama"" at WWDC last   year before confirming that the series was coming to Apple Music.   The show will feature 16 celebrity hosts, and will likewise be   released weekly instead of all at once.Personally, neither show looks particularly compelling to me.   But that's precisely the challenge that Apple now faces.If the strategy fails, it will fail (relatively) cheaplyGiven the extremely diverse spectrum of consumer preferences   when it comes to video content, Apple will need to create content   across a wide range of genres that appeal to a wide range of   consumers if the company truly wants to position original content   as a differentiator and selling feature in a meaningful way. As   Apple Music expands around the world, Apple will also need to   localize content and cater to local preferences in geographical   regions all around the world.That'sexpensive, and a tough balance even for pure-play media companies that   specialize in and have deep experience with content. Apple has   neither, even if it has deep pockets. Furthermore, the company   has made it quite clear that it its content strategy is intended   to bolster Apple Music, and has no intention to launch a   stand-alone video streaming service (although not for a lack of trying). Besides, who subscribes to a music service specifically in   order to get video content?Apple Music. Image source: Apple.However, there is some potential forPlanet of the Appsto inspire a new generation of developers, which would be a   secondary benefit. Apple relies heavily on its army of   third-party developers to keep its digital repositories flush   with app content, and culturally reinforcing its pipeline of   developers is a good thing. The show may serve in part as a giant   episodic marketing campaign to come develop for iOS.This is likely just the beginning for Apple, and presumably   the company will diversify its content strategy further going   forward. Fortunately for investors, the risks are fairly modest   for a company of this size. While shows are expensive -- a season   can easily cost tens of millions of dollars -- they're much less   than if Apple were to pursue some sort oftheoretical blockbuster acquisitionaround video streaming. On top of that, Apple Music's revenue run   rate is in excess of $2.4 billion right now, based on the 20   million subscribers it disclosed in December.I still think the original content strategy is misguided, but   at least the financial risks are small if it fails.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Finding the Gems in the Dow;2/14/2017;"In late January, the Dow Jones Industrial Average hit 20,000, a milestone that was met with plenty of fanfare. Like many stock market-related headlines, however, the Dow's big day should be taken with a grain of salt. Yes, it represents a rise in the index, and that's not a bad thing, but the number itself really isn't significant.As a matter of fact, breaking 20,000 isn't even that remarkable when you consider the trajectory of the Dow since its inception in 1896. It took over a decade to reach 100, then 66 years to reach 1,000, then another 41 years to make 15,000 (in May 2013). In fact, it hovered around 10,000 for a decade:makeArticleAd();All things considered, rising by 5,000 in three-and-a-half years isn't that big a deal.The Motley Fool's Daniel Kline writes, ""In practical terms, 20,000 means nothing. It's just a round number, and it's easier to celebrate those than picking a random one."" He says Trump's promises to ease regulation and lower business taxes were key drivers behind the Dow's push and argues, ""Because Trump is something we have never seen before…we have no idea what might happen because there is no precedent.""Mohamed El-Erian, Bloomberg columnist and chief economic adviser for Allianz, is equally dispassionate about the market event. ""Let's start by acknowledging,"" he writes, ""that the DJIA is far from comprehensive when it comes to analytical content. The index covers a very narrow set of stocks and therefore is lacking in representation."" He argues that evaluating the implications of the ""hype about the Dow reaching 20,000 comes down to evaluating the volume of the signal, the influence on investing and business behaviors, and the implications for economic governance.""Like others, I think the importance of this milestone has a relatively short shelf-life. Eventually, the market will move on to more significant things like corporate earnings, valuations, industry developments, and related issues. That said, I think the market event presents two important takeaways for investors:The power of long-term investing and compounding returns. Over long periods of time, the stock market is one of the best ways to generate long-term wealth. Since 1928, the Dow Jones 30 has produced an annualized return of about 10%, including dividends. By reaching 20,000, the Dow reminds us of the long-term wealth creation that can be achieved when investing in the markets over time with discipline. If the returns over the next 7-10 years are close to the 10% annual return the Dow has generated historically, we could see Dow 40,000 by around 2025-2027.Returns don't come in a straight line. If you are just getting into the market now or you have funds to put to work, you shouldn't expect the same returns in the market over the next five years that the last five years have generated, and there will be plenty of bumps along the way. The reason that stocks produce the returns they do is because they are risky in the short term. When you get excited by events like the Dow hitting 20,000 and think you might be missing out, always remember that you have to be able to stomach short-term volatility to get the long-term gains stocks have produced.Using my guru-based stock screening models, I found the following high-scoring picks among the Dow 30:International Business Machines Corporation (IBM)is a technology company that operates through five segments: Global Technology Services (GTS), Global Business Services (GBS), Software, Systems Hardware and Global Financing. The company earns a perfect score under our James O'Shaughnessy-inspired stock screening model based on its size ($168.5 billion) and cash flow-per-share of $17.11 which is well above the market average of $1.43. Trailing 12-month sales of $79.9 billion are nearly 4 times the market average (required to be 1.5 times the average).UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (UNH)is a diversified healthcare company that earns high marks under our Martin Zweig-based investment methodology given its current price-earnings ratio of 22.13 which compares favorably with the market P/E of 18.0. In order to pass this screen, revenue growth must not be substantially lower than earnings growth (for earnings to continue to grow over time they must be supported by a comparable or better sales growth rate). With revenue growth of 13.63% and earnings growth of 8.9% (based on 3, 4 and 5 year averages), UNH passes this screen. The company also earns a perfect score under our O'Shaughnessy-based model due to its size (market capitalization of $152.7 billion) and persistence in earnings-per-share.Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ), through its subsidiaries, provides communications, information and entertainment products and services to consumers, businesses and governmental agencies. The company is favored by our David Dreman-based screening model due to its size (market cap of $198.9 billion). Medium to large-sized companies (the largest 1500 companies) are preferred by this model because they are more in the public eye and an investor is less exposed to risk of ""accounting gimmickry"". VZ earns a perfect score under our O'Shaughnessy-based investment strategy due to its cash flow-per-share of $7.24, well above the market mean of $1.43, and its dividend yield of 4.73%.Apple Inc. (AAPL), the tech behemoth, earns a perfect score under our Warren Buffett-inspired investment strategy due to its earnings predictability and ability to pay off all debt with earnings within two years. Average return-on-equity over the past ten years (31.5%) is more than double the required minimum of 15%, and free cash flow per share of $7.30 indicates that the company is generating more cash that it is consuming. Management's use of retained earnings reflects a favorable return of 20.7%. The company also gets a thumb's up from our O'Shaughnessy-based model given its trailing 12-month sales ($218.1 billion) and the number of shares outstanding (5,328), which is nearly nine times the market average (620 million).At the time of publication, John Reese and his clients were   long IBM, UNH, VZ, AAPL"

Apple Inc. (AAPL) Tips its Hand on iPhone 8 Wireless Charging;2/14/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThere are always plenty of rumors flying around aboutApple Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AAPL) coming iPhone releases. Usually, these are based on information leaked from the AAPL supply chain, but on a very few occasions, Apple itself inadvertently tips its hand.makeArticleAd();Source: Wireless Power ConsortiumThat appears to be the case with the iPhone 8. For several months, the 10th anniversary release has been rumored to feature wireless charging. Thanks to an AAPL move, that now seems like a lock.AAPL Joins the Wireless Power ConsortiumBusiness Insiderbroke the newsthat Apple has joined the Wireless Power Consortium (or WPC). WPC is an industry association that oversees Qi, the most widely used wireless charging technology. That puts AAPL in a group with over 220 other companies that are members, including smartphone rivalSamsung Electronic(OTCMKTS:SSNLF), whose Galaxy S7 supports Qi wireless charging.Apple does already use Qi wireless charging for the Apple Watch, but the company tweaked its implementation so it's not compatible with standard Qi chargers. And it never bothered to join WPC - until now. That move is a very strong indicator that AAPL is planning to incorporate Qi wireless charging on a larger scale, and that points to the iPhone 8.7 Dividend Stocks for the Retirement You DeserveApple confirmed it had joined WPC (although the confirmation isn't really necessary given that it's nowlisted as a memberon the organization's website), but it did so by trying to minimize the implications. A company spokesperson toldBusiness Insider:""Apple is an active member of many standards development organizations, as both a leader and contributor. Apple is joining the Wireless Power Consortium to be able to participate and contribute ideas to the open, collaborative development of future wireless charging standards. We look forward to working together with the WPC and its members.""What WPC Membership Means for iPhone 8 Wireless ChargingDespite AAPL's attempt to position its move as business as usual, joining WPC is a strong indication that rumors about the iPhone 8 offering wireless charging have been on the mark. However, Qi isn't the advanced, over-the-air wireless charging many people had been hoping AAPL would implement.Instead, Qi - which has been in use since 2011- uses inductive charging. Rather than plugging an iPhone into a charger with a Lightning cable, it would be placed on a charge pad. So there's still a recharger that requires physical contact, and that recharger is still plugged into the wall.And it seems very plausible that wireless charging would be supported by the iPhone 8, but only offered as an extra at an additional cost. There has already been speculation that AAPL would useoptional wireless chargingto further drive up the amount consumers spend on a new iPhone purchase. In this case, they would have to add an Apple wireless charger to the tab (somethingSamsung charges an additional $49.99 forwith the Galaxy S7).Couldn't iPhone 8 buyers simply buy one of the many Qi charge pads already on the market? They would undoubtedly be less expensive than Apple's version.Well, there's also a good chance that AAPL could pull a move like it did with the Apple Watch, tweaking its Qi implementation slightly so someone buying the new iPhone couldn't simply use a standard third-party Qi charger.Will Qi Wireless Charging Make the iPhone 8 More Desirable?IHS Technology noted thepopularity of wireless charging with consumers, suggesting it was a feature AAPL couldn't ignore with the iPhone 8:""The success of wireless charging adoption from Apple's competitors is something that Apple can no longer ignore. IHS Technology consumer survey data shows over 90% of consumers want wireless charging on their next device.""Consumers may be expecting somethingmorefrom the iPhone 8, though.Qi wireless charging is mainstream now, and there were hopes Apple would adopttruewireless charging, going with over-the-air technology instead of following the pack. Many smartphone buyers skip Qi charging altogether (the charge pad can actually be larger and more cumbersome than a plug-in charger), especially if it's an additional cost.The ability to set a device on furniture or other accessories like speaker systems ordesk lamps that have integrated QI charge padsis cool, but if AAPL chooses to go with a non-standard implementation, those probably wouldn't work with the iPhone 8.Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock Is on Cloud 9It may end up that wireless charging on the iPhone 8 is essentially a marketing move - a way to make extra money from those who care, and a bullet point on the features list that keeps the new iPhone on par with the competition. Or maybe AAPL engineers will pull off something unexpected.Either way, now that Apple has officially joined the WPC, you can expect Qi wireless charging on the iPhone 8.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace9 Top Pharmaceutical Stocks to Buy for the Dividends10 Super-Safe Dividend Growth Stocks to Buy TodayThe postApple Inc.

4 Dividend-Growth Stocks to Own for the Next 10 Years;2/14/2017;"By Michael FosterIn my last article, I talked aboutApple's (AAPL)destiny as a Dividend Aristocrat. The company doesn't have even   five years' worth of payouts under its belt, but there are clear   indicators that it will never struggle to pay dividends.In a moment, I'll show you how you can combine Tim Cook's   company with 3 other stocks and get a 4.6% yield in 10 years or   less--and triple-digit upside in the meantime.First, back to Apple.makeArticleAd();The company's strong--and rising--free cash flow and its   operating margin, which has surged over the last 20 years and   stayed at historically high levels, indicate that Apple has   turned into a cash-producing machine investors should not   ignore.Ironically, many people don't see Apple as a cash machine when   they buy or sell the stock; instead, they obsess over iPhone and   iPad sales. This leads to a panic when these sales are weak and   euphoria when they're strong.But this short-termism is destined to lose because buying and   holding Apple will mean collecting a dividend that will grow   faster than those of supposedly ""safer"" and more boring stocks   likeGeneral Electric (GE), AT&T (T), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Chevron (CVX), Consolidated Edison (ED)andExxon Mobil (XOM).Yet Apple is thecheapeststock among this group when we look at its price-to-earnings   (P/E) ratio:Apple's a BargainWith a P/E ratio less than half that of XOM, you'd expect   Apple's dividend to be more at risk, right? This is where the   story really gets wild. Take a look at this chart:Whose Dividend Is Safe?Here's what this chart is telling us: Apple paid 23% of its   free cash flow as dividends in the last 12 months, while XOM's   dividend was18.9 times greaterthan its free cash flow. And you're paying more than twice the   price for that negative dividend coverage.It's clear that Apple is a much better stock to buy for   dividend growth than the best-known large-cap dividend payers,   including some of the most respected and beloved Dividend   Aristocrats (or companies that have increased their payouts for   25 straight years or more).Now I want to show how you can create a portfolio with Apple   and some other, lesser-known stocks with equal or better dividend   coverage and stronger dividend-growth potential. That, in turn,   will help you get a portfolio yielding nearly 5% in the next 10   years, while delivering big upside potential.In addition to Apple, I'm eyeingBanner (BANR),Amphenol (APH)andMB Financial (MBFI)I've chosen these companies because they have ridiculous dividend   growth. While Amphenol ""only"" saw its dividend rise by 204% in   the last five years, MBFI's went up by 1,800% and BANR's rose   2,200%.This is partly due to the fact that these companies started   off with one-cent dividends, so for my future projections, I'm   going to be much more conservative and look only at the   dividend-growth rate over the last three years, which is much   more modest, at 60% or less. Here's how the numbers look:Reaching High Yields FastIt takes just a decade to get to a 4.6% yield for this   portfolio, given our modest assumptions. In reality, we'll likely   see much stronger dividend growth because each of these companies   has a really low payout ratio, or the percentage of the last 12   months' worth of earnings paid out as dividends. (MBFI's is the   highest, at just 28%, while APH's sits at 21%). These companies   couldtripletheir payouts and still have enough cash to cover those   dividends.Additionally, these companies have a strong history of price   growth, thanks to improving revenues and/or earnings, meaning   triple-digit returns in a few years:Years of Strong ReturnsNote also that these stocks aren't correlated to each other   (AAPL went down when BANR soared; APH was strong when MBFI was   flat and BANR was correcting). That's because we've got two   regional banks and two electronics companies--exposing us to   entirely separate sectors.This Portfolio Yields 8.0% NowA 4.6% yield is nice, but why wait up to 10 years for that   when you can get a safe 8.0% right now?I'm talking about the reliable group of income generators   we've gathered together in our new ""No-Withdrawal"" retirement portfolio. They throw offrock-solid yields of 6%, 8%, 9% and up!Like Apple, these income powerhouses boast payouts backed by   rock-solid balance sheets and soaring free cash flows. Also like   Apple, they're cheap now, but I don't expect that to last--so you   need to make your move soon.These no-drama plays are perfect for 2017, with trade wars, a   market correction after Dow 20,000 and big changes in US tax   policy all on the table--making uncertainty the buzzword for the   months ahead.Don't miss out.Click here and I'll share our 6 top picks for   high income and double-digit upside."

Bitcoin Meets Starbucks: iPayYou's Bold Bet Goes Live;2/14/2017;"By Michael ScottWith 2017 in full motion, Bitcoin’s price climb to the mid-$900 range and beyond continues to raise eyebrows. For many, this milestone is just one signal of cryptocurrency’s growing repute as a legitimate store of investment value.Little attention, however, has been given to Bitcoin’s utility as a day-to-day method of payment. Practical use cases involving consumer adoption, in fact, are rarely talked about. This is despite the well-documented cost, efficiency and security advantages of the Bitcoin payment network for both consumers and businesses alike.makeArticleAd();A new U.S.-based startup company aims to change this through an effort to accelerate the everyday use of Bitcoin for consumers worldwide. Launched in May of 2016,iPayYouis an online platform and digital wallet that promotes the viability of Bitcoin as a method of payment. It immediately saw early success through a unique feature known as Pay-by-Twitter — the first online platform site for peer-to-peer payments over Twitter (TWTR).Now in a bold bet sure to deliver a caffeine jolt to the retail sector, iPayYou this past December introduced Bitcoin Direct to Starbucks (SBUX), a new way for coffee aficionados to pay for those espressos and other drinks through the use of Bitcoin.This feature allows users to seamlessly transfer bitcoins from their existing iPayYou Bitcoin wallet to their Starbucks mobile app. They select how much (in USD) they wish to transfer before prompting Bitcoin Direct to Starbucks to automatically withdraw that amount from their iPayYou account. Once deposited into that person’s Starbucks account, purchases can be made via the mobile app at any Starbucks location.This latest addition to the iPayYou platform comes on the heels of iPayYou’s recent gift card integration, allowing Bitcoin to be used for instant gift card purchases from retailers like Amazon (AMZN), Best Buy (BBY) and iTunes (AAPL).These creative payment applications are the mastermind of founder and CEO Gene Kavner, former Worldwide Director of Amazon Associates. With extensive experience in the world of commerce, including prominent positions at Microsoft (MSFT) and Expedia (EXPE), Kavner developed iPayYou with the intention of establishing a easy-to-use Bitcoin wallet with simple features and low costs.Regarding the strategic collaboration with Starbucks, Kavner remarks: “The broader significance of this move is that iPayYou is able to encourage Bitcoins to be spent in ways that its creators intended — for everyday purchases from popular merchants without needing a bank account to do so. This arrangement with Starbucks allows coffee lovers to replenish their primary Starbucks account with their Bitcoin holdings.  We’ve accomplished this feat without Starbucks having to directly accept Bitcoin. Our hope is that through this demonstration Starbucks will soon begin accepting Bitcoin directly, sooner rather than later.”In terms of advantages for Starbucks regulars, Kavner continues: “We intend to show that Bitcoin is not only a great investment but is also becoming quite useful in everyday life. Because so many of us are addicted to coffee, being able to use Bitcoin to purchase anything at Starbucks is an enormous win for everyday consumers. And Starbucks will benefit too due to the amount of Bitcoin users who will now become customers.”Over time, Kavner believes that initiatives like this will encourage merchant acceptance of Bitcoin. “Probably the most important metric that every merchant looks at when deciding what methods of payment to accept is how many new customers will it help attract. A key reason for the slow merchant adoption of Bitcoin has been the relatively limited amount of people who wanted to use Bitcoin for POS transactions. Now, I believe that more and more will.”In terms of what’s next for Bitcoin Direct for 2017 and beyond, Kavner is optimistic: “We’re going to continue to make Bitcoin easier, safer and more useful over 2017 and beyond. We are planning on expanding to enable more merchant adoption as well as adding many features that every Bitcoin wallet should have. At the same time, we’ll make Bitcoin simple to understand, not just to those of us who know and love Bitcoin already but for the everyday consumer who may not even know what Bitcoin is. We’ll continue to innovate to make Bitcoin easier and more useful for everyone.”"

Finally,Microsoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) was flooded with calls ahead of today's ex-dividend date.Tesla Inc (TSLA)With earnings just around the corner - next Wednesday to be precise - Tesla is making waves on Wall Street after announcing that it will begin production of its Model 3 by the end of the month. News on the Model 3 front send TSLA stock higher, and prompted analysts atOppenheimer to commentthat Tesla could take advantage of its new stock highs to dip into the capital market to raise funds for Model 3 production, which could be seen as a bullish sentiment indicator.7 Dividend Stocks for the Retirement You DeserveSo far, however, options traders are reluctant to get out in front of Model 3 production, or next week's earnings report. Volume on Monday came in at a brisk 301,000 contracts, but calls only accounted for 54% of the day's take. But the lull in call volume may be due to the fact that short-term traders are already heavily bullish on TSLA stock.Looking at TSLA's 27 Feb action, the put/call open interest ratio comes in at 0.68, with calls clearly in command. Overall, implieds for the series are pricing in a potential move of about 7%, with the upper bound at $300 and the lower bound at $260.Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD)GILD stock rallied nearly 2% yesterday ahead ofclinical trial data on the company's new HIV drug, and it appears that Gilead bulls are about to be rewarded. The company said that its HIV treatment, Bictegravir, delivered 97% virus suppression, which is just as effective as the leading HIV treatment made byGlaxoSmithKline Plc (ADR)(NYSE:GSK). Furthermore, there were no cases of emerging resistance and no reported kidney problems, which can be an issue with HIV treatments.GILD stock is up another 1% in premarket activity following the report, and yesterday's call traders have to be cheering the results. On Monday, GILD saw volume rise to 258,000 contracts, with calls snapping up 75% of the day's take.Turning to the March series, options traders have taken out heavy call positions at the $67 through $75 strikes, with more than 5,500 contracts open at each. Peak call OI for the month numbers 7,600 contracts at the $75 strike, though that would be a long haul for GILD, which recently plunged on news of declining revenue for the company's Hep-C cure.Microsoft Corporation (MSFT)While MSFT stock received a nice pop near the end of January following Microsoft's quarterly report, the shares have been relatively quiet since. MSFT continues to hover just below long-term resistance in the $65-$66 region, though the longer-term trend remains steadily higher along support at its 10-week and 20-week moving averages.Intel Corporation (INTC) Stock Will Claw Its Way HigherOn Monday, options traders flooded MSFT stock, with total volume hitting a near-term high of more than 650,000 contracts. Calls made up an impressive 82% of yesterday's activity. But the action doesn't appear to be any new wave of bullish expectations, with traders instead focusing on dividend capture strategies ahead of today's ex-dividend trading.On that front,shareholders of recordas of the close yesterday are eligible for a dividend of 39 cents per share, payable on March 9.As of this writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace9 Top Pharmaceutical Stocks to Buy for the Dividends7 Marvelous Mid-Cap Stocks to Buy for the Best of All WorldsThe postTuesday's Vital Data: Tesla Inc (TSLA), Gilead Sciences, Inc.

Intel Corporation's Resource Shift;2/14/2017;"Back in April of 2016, microprocessor giantIntel(NASDAQ: INTC) announced that it would be implementing   restructuring actions that the company said were designed to   achieve annual run rate operating expense savings of $1.4   billion.At the time, Intel said that the restructuring was intended to   ""accelerate [Intel's] evolution from a [personal computer]   company to one that powers the cloud and billions of smart,   connected computing devices.""A wafer of Intel's 7tg generation Core chips. Image source:     Intel.makeArticleAd();At its Feb. 9 investor meeting, Intel went into much more   detail about how it has shifted around its spending. Let's take a   closer look.Investment shift year-over-yearIntel provided the following chart which illustrates a   ""bridge"" from Intel's 2016 operating expenses to its projected   2017 operating expenses:How Intel's research and development spending is shifting     year-over-year. Image source: Intel.This ""bridge"" shows that Intel expects operating expenses to   drop year-over-year due to the spin-off of its Intel Security   group (which will now be a stand-alone company called McAfee) as   well as reductions in its Client Computing Group (CCG) investment   levels.Offsetting those declines, though, is an increase in   investment levels in what the company collectively refers to as   its ""growth businesses"" -- Data Center Group, Internet of Things   Group, and Non-Volatile Solutions Group.Additionally, Intel says it's investing more in Moore's Law,   which means that it's boosting its investments in next generation   manufacturing technologies. This makes sense because the   company's new development methodology calls for the company to   continue to enhance existing manufacturing technologies while   simultaneously developing next-generation ones -- something that   it didn't really do before.All told, Intel is looking at a modest reduction in operating   expenses, year-over-year.Some additional detailIn addition to the broad year-over-year spending shifts that   Intel talked about above, CFO Bob Swan showed an additional slide   that gives more insight into how much research and development   spending by market segment is expected to shift from 2015 through   2017.How Intel's research and development spending changed by     product category. Image source: Intel.Intel is apparently cutting its research and development   spending in personal computer processors by 5% in 2017 relative   to where it was in 2015. That's not all that much, to be blunt,   and I'd imagine the bulk of that shift comes more from accounting   changes (i.e. allocating less of its shared operating expenses to   the PC segment and more of it to other segments, like the Data   Center Group).Data Center spending is expected to be up by 25% in that   two-year period. I'd imagine that part of that increase is due to   the shared expense allocation, but I also expect that Intel is   increasing its investments here in ways beyond simply a   reshuffling of expenses.Intel's investments in non-volatile memory -- a business that   Intel expects to be a key growth engine in the years ahead -- are   going up 40%. Considering that technology strength is critical to   succeeding in the non-volatile memory business (better technology   usually translates into a better cost structure, allowing a   company to more effectively compete at good margin levels), the   boost in spending isn't a surprise.The company's investments in mobile are going to be down 55%   per the slide. That's not surprising considering that Intel has   refocused its mobile business away from trying to build a broad   range of platforms to address the broad range of smartphones   toward focusing primarily on stand-alone cellular modems, withApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) being the company's principal (only?) smartphone   customer here.And, finally, Intel is expecting a big boost in its   investments within its Internet of Things Group. This business   has been growing steadily over the last several years and   management had indicated that they're making some big bets on new   areas like self-driving cars, so a large increase in research and   development spending here makes sense -- especially as the odds   that those investments will ultimately pay off look good.Intel's sensible spending shiftsAt the end of the day, these spending shifts are quite   reasonable -- the company is feeding those business segments that   have been growing and have the potential to continue to grow, and   it's cutting back in areas that aren't expected to grow (i.e. PC   processors) as well as in areas where its efforts have fallen   flat and success appears unlikely (mobile system-on-chip).Intel management is investing for the long-term, which is the   right thing to do. However, investments in high technology   usually take years to bear fruit, so don't expect these increased   investments made today to pay off tomorrow. It'll be a couple of   years before we know if Intel's increased investments will   ultimately pay off.10 stocks we like better than IntelWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Don’t Count Out Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Stock Just Yet;2/14/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBack on Jan. 30, I quipped thatNvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA) was going to return to record highs. Of course, NVDA stock did just that, hitting $120.92 just three days prior to Nvidia's fourth-quarter earnings report.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockBut the love affair with $120-plus prices was short-lived, and a strong sell-on-the-news bid following earnings sent Nvidia stock on an 11%-plus bender.Earnings were far from bad. In fact,the company blew past Wall Street's estimatesby 16 cents per share on revenue that soared 50% year-over-year. Unfortunately for NVDA stock holders, the pre-earnings rally left speculators hungry for profits, and the ""weak"" second-quarter guidance of $1.9 billion (analysts are expecting $1.88 billion) just wasn't enough to sustain level of euphoria heading into the report.If you were lucky enough to get into the Feb $115/$120 call spreadI recommended on Jan. 30, I hope you got out at the top on Feb. 7 and locked in a maximum return on the trade. There really was no reason to hold those NVDA options any longer once the stock topped $120.Alternately, if you opted for the Feb $100 put sell position, you locked in a nice profit of about $137 per contract when these options expired last Friday.But with Nvidia still caught in the throes of missed expectations, where does that leave traders now?Nvidia Sentiment and TechnicalsFor one thing, sentiment has improved sharply on the NVDA options front since I last checked in on the shares, hinting at elevated expectations. At the time, the the Feb. put/call open interest ratio rested at a lofty 1.31, but the equivalent March put/call OI ratio has fallen to 0.8, with calls now outnumbering puts among short-term options.7 High-Risk, High-Reward Stocks to Buy NowFurthermore, Wall Street analysts haven't budged an inch on their bullish Nvidia stance. Thomson/First Call ratings stand exactly where they were heading into earnings, with 21 of the 35 analysts following NVDA stock rating the shares a ""buy"" or better.And herein lies the problem.Nvidia stock is saturated with hype right now. So much so, that smart money is probably selling NVDA to take advantage of the situation. Keep in mind that this doesn't mean the stock's long-term uptrend won't remain intact. But a short-term correction could shake out the weak hands, thus allowing smart money to step back in when the price is right.So, what's the right price? Well, that all depends on your trading outlook, but I would argue that NVDA stock is a bargain buy on any trade below $100 given the company's prospects for 2017 and beyond.For short-term options traders, however, the equation is much simpler: Where do implieds suggest the stock will be trading in the next couple of months?Click to EnlargeFor this, we turn to March implieds, and discover that options are pricing in a potential move of about 6.2% for NVDA stock. This places the upper bound at about $114, while the lower bound rests near key support at $100.2 Trades for NVDA StockCall Spread:While smart money may be selling NVDA stock right now, I'm not willing to bet against the shares just yet. Nvidia's fourth-quarter report was nothing short of stellar, meaning bargain hunters are bound to step in sooner rather than later.Intel Corporation (INTC) Stock Will Claw Its Way HigherTraders looking to take on a bit of risk and bet on a return to form for NVDA stock might consider a March $110/$115 bull call spread. At last check, this spread was offered at $1.66, or $166 per pair of contracts. Breakeven lies at $111.66, while a maximum profit of $3.34, or $334 per pair of contracts, is possible if Nvidia closes at or above $115 when March options expire.Put Sell:But if an outright call spread is a bit too much risk to take on at the moment, the $100 put sell trade still looks like a winner. Just roll that strike out to the March series, and you're set.At last check, the March $100 put was bid at $1.39, or $139 per contract. If Nvidia offers up a repeat performance in March and closes above $100 at expiration, then you get to keep the premium received. But, if NVDA stock trades below $100 ahead of expiration, then traders may be assigned 100 shares at a price of $100 per share, for every contract sold.As of this writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceTrade of the Day: New High for Apple Inc.

Intel Corporation (INTC) Stock Will Claw Its Way Higher;2/14/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsShares of semiconductor powerhouseIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) have bounced over the past two trading days, joining the broader stock market. But unlike many parts of the market - which broke higher from sideways consolidation phases - INTC stock bounced off a critical near-term technical support area.makeArticleAd();This not only promises a further bounce in Intel shares - it allows traders to clearly define their risk.When Intel reported its latest batch of earnings a few weeks ago, its numbers - and its outlook - looked good. However, INTC stock sold off on the news. The post-earnings pullback totaled about 10% by last Friday.Semiconductor stocks as a group currently find themselves at an interesting juncture in the sense that some of the larger stocks in the group trade like a mixed bag of fruit. Intel stock fell after earnings, but now it's bouncing.Nvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA) exhausted itself after earnings last week andhas since dropped, yet the broader semiconductor as represented by theMarket Vectors Semiconductor ETF(MUTF:SMH) continues to plug higher.To me, this says that the trading opportunities should be focused on single-stock technical levels.INTC Stock ChartsOn the multiyear weekly chart, we see that while Intel continues to hold its 2009 support trendline, it has found plenty of technical resistance around the $38 area since late 2014.Click to EnlargeSo far this area has been rejected three times, most recently following the latest earnings report in January. Note also that the purple-dotted 2009 support line coincides with the 200-week simple moving average (red), making this a critical area of support, currently around the $30-$31 area.9 Top Pharmaceutical Stocks to Buy for the DividendsWhile this support area is of no direct concern to my trade idea in INTC stock today, it is important for greater context.Moving on to the daily chart, we see that Intel stock had a classic ""pop-and-drop"" move on Jan. 27 following its earnings report. This is pretty similar to what we've witnessed in NVDA after its earnings report late last week.Click to EnlargeINTC stock initially popped on Jan. 27, but quickly reversed lower and closed in the red for the day. This set in motion the aforementioned 10% selloff that came to a halt last Friday (at least for now).Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN): Is It Time to Start Worrying?Last Friday, INTC found support at its 200-day simple moving average (red), which currently also coincides with the 2015 diagonal support line (purple-dotted line). The stock closed well off its intraday lows last Friday. This was followed by an up-day Monday, which in turn led my proprietary B2 Reversal Indicator to flash a buy signal for a trade.Traders should eye a next upside target around $36.50, while using last Friday's lows around $34.80 as a last-resort stop-loss.Like what you see?

Fossil (FOSL) Earnings Coming Up: Time For A Rebound?;2/14/2017;"Fossil (FOSL) is set to report fourth quarter fiscal 2016 results after the closing bell this afternoon. Although revenue and profits have been hard to come by amid increased competition from the likes of Apple (AAPL), there’s still a lot to love with FOSL stock on this Valentine’s Day.Though best known for its watches, the Texas-based company also makes jewelry, handbags, small leather goods, belts, sunglasses and a host of apparel. Not only has the company beaten Wall Street’s earnings estimates in two straight quarter, Fossil has missed just once in the past eight quarters. And with a possible beat Tuesday and upbeat guidance, Fossil, which has seen its shares decline some 30% over the past year, could be on a verge of a recovery.For the three months that ended December, Wall Street’s expect Fossil to earn $1.20 per share on revenue of $977.13 million. This compares to the year-ago quarter when the company earned $1.46 per share on $992.5 million in revenue. For the full year, earnings are projected to be $1.92 per share, while revenue of $3.06 billion would decline 3% year over year.makeArticleAd();During third quarter, Fossil reported net income of $17.4 million, or 36 cents per share, down from  $57.5 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2015. While citing a challenging environment for the traditional watch category, the company lowered its fiscal 2016 outlook. But Fossil, which currently operates 600 stores in 150 countries, has begun to restructure the business to achieve not only greater profitability, but also to speed up product innovation, which has been a main driver in the company’s growth.In that regard, as part of efforts to fast-track new products, the company in October unveiled some forty hybrid smartwatches. Fossil at the time said the new products would not only help it fight off competition to gain market share, but could also help boost profit margins from price increases. Combined with the company’s plan to emerge leaner from store closures, FOSL stock, which closed Monday at $22.98 looks like a relative bargain.The stock is priced at just 13 times fiscal 2017 estimates $1.78 per share, which is about six points below the S&P 500 index. Yet those estimates don’t yet factor the company’s ability — amid its restructuring — to become more agile and respond more quickly to changing markets. As such, from a risk versus reward perspective, Fossil, which now trades near 52-week lows, is a stock to keep an eye on for the next 12 to 18 months. With a bit of luck these shares can shoot up to $28, delivering 22% returns."

Order has once again been restored to the Wall Street hierarchy.Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) has finally joined the ranks of market leaders resting at all-time highs. At $133.29, yesterday's final print was good enough to register a new record closing high for AAPL stock.The ascent bested its previous record notched in 2015 by a few pennies. With the king of all i-Things now appropriately perched at new heights, the question plaguing spectators is whether or not now is the time to take a bite.The answer, in short, is no.As exciting as milestones like new record highs can be, the reality is Apple stock is extremely extended. Such lofty levels leave much to be desired on the risk/reward front. While the new highs may indeed spark renewed interest in the stock, its overbought status is simply too big of a negative to ignore.Source: OptionsAnalytixRemember, traders should focus less on what action they think may generate profitsthistime and more on what action they think will create profitsmostof the time.10 Super-Safe Dividend Growth Stocks to Buy TodayAnd let's be honest - most of the time, chasing a stock already perched in the nosebleeds is a money loser.Sell AAPL Puts for ProfitStock investors should be praying to the market gods for an Apple stock dip in the coming days. Or, better yet, sell out-of-the-money puts to create a potential win-win scenario. Right now you can sell the Mar $130 put option for $1.08. The short put obligates you to buy 100 shares of AAPL if the stock falls below $130 by expiration. Since you received $1.08 up front, your effective purchase price will drop to $128.92 which is a modest 3.3% discount to Monday's closing price.And if AAPL stock remains above $130, you can simply keep the $1.08 and then consider selling another put for April.At the time of this writing, Tyler Craig had no positions in any of the aforementioned securities.Tell us what you think about this article!

Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN): Is It Time to Start Worrying?;2/14/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) seems unstoppable. This is also one of the biggest problems for AMZN stock. When everyone is in, there is no upside left. Of the 43 analysts now covering Amazon,33 have it rated as a buyand none have it lower than a hold.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockBut the expectations attached to these recommendations are what should give Amazon bulls pause. Most analysts expect sharp acceleration of earnings this year, far beyond what the company has delivered so far, with estimates as high as $17.43 per share in 2018.AMZN is a company which, until recently, never made any money, instead being obsessed with plowing every dollar it could find into growth opportunities.Even after closing the books on 2016 - net income of $2.371 billion, or $4.90 per share on revenue of $135.987 billion - Amazon's profitability still trails that ofWal-Mart Stores Inc(NYSE:WMT), which earned $3.034 billion, or 98 cents per share, on revenue of $118.790 billion in the October quarter alone.4 Dow Jones Titans That Are Shooting HigherThe super-bullish stance on Amazon stock is based on the idea that, despite its growth, it still has a long way to grow, and that it will soon extract margins the retail industry has never seen.Forget stopping Amazon, though. But, can anyone hope to contain it?Eye-Popping NumbersAt its Feb. 13 opening price just below $832 per share, Amazon stock is selling at 168 times 2016 earnings. Its market cap of $402 billion represents approximately three times its sales, which is an absurd number for a company that is still, at heart, a retailer. Most retail market caps are a fraction of revenue.But of course, the bulls respond,Amazon isn't really a retailer. Indeed, AMZN is the leading cloud provider, a front-runner in artificial intelligence with Alexa, and is the first ""over the top"" video provider to gain Oscar buzz.All elements of its logistics are for sale, includingpayments, deliveries andeverything in between.Wherever you look with Amazon, you seeeye-popping numbers.

Click on symbol links in each slide for current share prices and more.American ExpressLook no further than American Express to understand just how serious Warren Buffett is about investing for the long haul. He picked up his initial stake in the credit card company in 1991, when a struggling AmEx badly needed capital. Berkshire obliged, getting favorable terms on its investment. As of December 31, 2016, Berkshire owned 16.6% of AmEx's outstanding shares, according to CNBC'sBerkshire Hathaway Portfolio Tracker. Buffett has played the role of white knight many times over the years, including during the 2008 financial crisis, as a means to get stakes in good companies at a discount.The stock today: AmEx shares change hands at 14 times expected earnings for 2017, according to a survey of analysts by Thomson Reuters. That's in line with the stock's five-year average. Although the stock doesn't look particularly cheap, neither does it look expensive. Based on current estimates, the price/earnings ratio of the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index is about 17. Analysts at William Blair Equity Research say the diversity of AmEx's business is underappreciated. The firm has a rating of ""outperform"" (buy, essentially) on the stock.SEE ALSO:25 Dividend Stocks You Can Buy and Hold ForeverAppleBuffett doesn't deserve all the credit for all of Berkshire's investments. In fact, the decision to buy Apple shares last year was made by one of Buffett's stock-picking lieutenants. Apple does have some of the attributes Buffett has said he likes: It's a leader in its market, and it has a ton of cash at its disposal. The stock was also trading at lower levels when Berkshire did its buying in 2016.The stock today: With shares reaching new highs, Apple is much more expensive now than it was when Berkshire first took a stake. But UBS analysts say the price gain is deserved because the number of iPhones in use continues to grow by double-digit percentages and retention rates remain high. UBS ratesApple stocka ""buy,"" but picking up shares on dips over time might be preferable to going all in at today's record prices.SEE ALSO:10 Stocks Every Retiree Should OwnCoca-ColaBuffett famously watched Coca-Cola for 52 years before investing in the stock. He finally took the plunge in 1988. ""We expect to hold these securities for a long time,"" Buffett wrote back then of his new stake in Coke in a letter to Berkshire shareholders. ""In fact, when we own portions of outstanding businesses with outstanding managements, our favorite holding period is forever."" As of December 31, 2016, Berkshire owned 9.4% of Coca-Cola's outstanding shares.The stock today: Coca-Cola currently trades at 21 times expected earnings. That's a bit rich, given that analysts project average earnings growth of just 2% a year for the next five years, according to Thomson Reuters. Analysts at Credit Suisse have a ""neutral"" rating on the stock (hold, essentially), saying they have concerns about an expansion of global regulations on sweetened products. If you already own the stock, find comfort in a plump dividend that has increased 54 years in a row.General ElectricBerkshire's stake can be traced back to the lifeline that Buffett threw to General Electric in 2008. At the time, GE's finance arm was suffering the same as other big banks. ""The GE investment resulted from Buffett's reputation and personal relationships, and Berkshire's very large cash position during the financial crisis,"" Kass says. But Buffett wouldn't have stepped in if he didn't believe in the company. ""GE is the symbol of American business to the world,"" Buffett said at the time. ""I am confident that GE will continue to be successful in the years to come."" Berkshire received preferred shares and warrants in exchange for cash. The preferred shares paid handsome dividends until GE later bought them back, and the warrants gave Berkshire the right to buy GE common shares at below-market prices.Goldman SachsGoldman Sachs is another holding Berkshire picked up during the 2008 financial crisis. Buffett paid $5 billion for preferred shares and warrants to purchase common stock. The preferred shares came with a dividend yield of 10%. Buffett said the investments in Goldman Sachs and General Electric - and similar deals with Dow Chemical, Swiss Re and Wrigley - delivered a total of $2.1 billion annually in dividends and interest. Berkshire bought another $2 billion in Goldman stock when it exercised the warrants in 2013. Goldman redeemed its preferred shares in 2011.The stock today: Credit Suisse analysts rate Goldman shares at ""outperform,"" thanks in large part to the potential for lower corporate taxes and loosened financial regulations under the Trump administration. Not everyone is as enthusiastic about the stock, however, especially in light of its 35% share-price gain since Election Day. Of the 18 analysts surveyed by Zacks, seven have Goldman at ""strong buy,"" two rate it a ""buy,"" eight rate it a ""hold"" and one has a ""strong sell"" recommendation on the shares.International Business MachinesLongtime Berkshire watchers were surprised when the company revealed this stake in 2011 because Buffett had shown little interest in technology stocks. But after reading IBM's annual reports for more than 50 years without buying a single share, he was finally swayed by what he saw closer to home. ""We went around to all of our companies to see how their IT departments functioned ... and I just came away with a different view of the position that IBM holds within IT departments and why they hold it and the stickiness and a whole bunch of things,"" Buffett said at the time. Berkshire owned 8.5% of IBM's outstanding shares as of December 31, 2016.The stock today: UBS is ""neutral"" on IBM, but it says better times might be ahead now that a period of heavy investment back into the business is slowing down. Cost cuts will bolster the bottom line, and the company's Watson cognitive computing division is showing early promise. Buffett-like patience might be required, though, considering that the stock price has been stagnant for the past five years. IBM's solid dividend yield helps.SEE ALSO:10 Best Dividend Stocks in the Dow AveragesJohnson & JohnsonDuring the 2008 financial crisis, Buffett reluctantly sold Johnson & Johnson shares to raise cash to invest in Goldman Sachs, GE and other struggling companies. By 2012, the reluctance had disappeared and Berkshire had essentially dumped its position in J&J, with Buffett saying the company was ""messed up in a lot of ways"" due to production problems and recalls. Despite the shift in sentiment, Kass says Berkshire's initial foray into J&J made sense because the stock was undervalued at the time.The stock today: The outlook for J&J is brighter these days than it was when Buffett abandoned ship, though the majority of analysts who follow the company are content to stand pat for now. Of the 18 analysts surveyed by Zacks, 10 rate it at ""hold."" Seven consider the stock a ""buy"" or ""strong buy"" and just one calls it a ""sell."" Income investors can rest easy. The dividend is as secure as it can be, having been raised every year for 54 straight years.Procter & GambleBerkshire was a longtime shareholder in Gillette when Procter & Gamble acquired the razor blade company in 2005. Buffett called it a ""dream deal,"" as Berkshire received P&G shares in exchange for its Gillette holdings. As with Johnson & Johnson, Buffett reluctantly sold some P&G shares in 2008 to raise cash to invest in distressed companies. Cut to 2014. Berkshire struck a deal to buy Duracell from P&G. To avoid a big tax bill, Berkshire arranged to hand over its P&G shares rather than pay cash for Duracell.The stock today: William Blair Equity Research rates P&G at ""outperform,"" noting that its focus on major brands, such as Tide detergent, and cost cuts offer ""a solid total shareholder return opportunity."" Shares are not on sale, however, trading at 21 times year-ahead earnings. For comparison, the S&P 500 trades at 17 times future earnings. P&G's dividend is the definition of reliable; it dates back to 1891.VisaCredit cards are a Berkshire staple. The holding company also owns stakes in MasterCard and the aforementioned America Express. But Visa and MasterCard are growing faster than AmEx, says Kass, and both are investments of Todd Combs, one of Berkshire's chief investing strategists not named Warren. Payments processing is a rapidly expanding market, thanks to the emergence of mobile payments, such as Apple Pay. Global revenue from mobile payments is forecast to exceed $1 trillion by 2019, up from $450 billion in 2015, according to Statista, a data research firm.The stock today: ""On the heels of solid December quarter results, we are raising our estimates and reiterate our Outperform rating on Visa,"" says Credit Suisse. ""We believe shares are attractively valued at 21 times ... calendar 2018 earnings."" And while the dividend yield is nothing to write home about, Visa shares have proved their long-term worth by outpacing rivals MasterCard and AmEx in price growth over the past two, five and 10 years.VerizonVerizon seems like an unlikely bet for Buffett in some ways. Its future is hitched to growth in digital mobile content and advertising, which makes it something of a bet on tech. That why it's probably not a Buffett call. ""Verizon is likely an investment of Todd Combs or Ted Weschler, who have several telecom stocks in their portfolio,"" says Kass of Buffett's two chief stock-picking lieutenants. Either way, Berkshire all but abandoned its position at the end of last year, selling most of its 15 million shares.The stock today: The first thing that stands out with Verizon is the high dividend yield. Even better for income investors is the fact that the company has raised its payout every year since 2006. However, most analysts think the stock will underperform the S&P 500 this year. Of the 25 analysts surveyed by Zacks, 18 rate the shares at ""hold,"" five have it at ""buy"" or ""strong buy,"" and two rate it at ""sell."" William Blair Equity Research, which rates the company at ""market perform"" (hold, essentially), notes that intense competition is hurting financial results of late. Verizon, which bought AOL in 2015, is in the process of acquiring Yahoo, though it's far from a done deal after Yahoo disclosed serious security breaches that exposed user information to hackers.TAKE THE QUIZ:How Well Do You Really Know Warren Buffett?Walmart StoresBuffett sold off big chunks of Berkshire's Walmart stake last year. That's because the retailer is losing out to Amazon.com, Kass says. Buffett has made no secret of his admiration for Amazon's CEO, Jeff Bezos. ""We haven't seen many businessmen like him,"" Buffett says of Bezos. ""Overwhelmingly, he's taken things you and I've been buying and he's figured out a way to make us happier buying those products, either by fast delivery or prices or whatever it may be, and that's remarkable.""The stock today: Berkshire first bought Walmart in 2005, and it has been a disappointing investment. Shares in the world's largest retailer have gained 32% on a price basis since mid 2005. The S&P 500 is up 80% over the same time frame. Analysts at Stifel have a ""hold"" recommendation onWalmart shares. ""We think a continued focus on grocery, including improved online and mobile ordering and increased offerings of more healthful products (i.e., organic), will continue to drive modest share gains,"" Stifel analysts say.SEE ALSO:25 Dividend Stocks You Can Buy and Hold Forever"

Apple (AAPL): Australian Banks Soften Stance on Apple Pay;2/13/2017;"Apple Inc.AAPLhas been facing tremendous challenges in Australia as the banks had been opposing to acknowledge Apple Pay, the way they accepted Android Pay.Apple's demand of 15 basis points in interchange fees had made the deal less palatable for Australian banks.  Additionally, the company blocks third-party payment apps from iPhone unless they sign up for Apple Pay. Reuters observes that ""Apple charges card providers for transactions made using Apple Pay and does not allow companies to develop their own mobile wallets, which would allow banks to circumvent transaction fees and get customers to engage more frequently with their own apps.""Australia has a very big market for contactless payments and fees for processing such transactions are a big source of income for regional banks. Android Pay has not demanded any such charges. As a result, the banks are happy collaborating with Android Pay.Apple Inc. PriceApple Inc. Price|Apple Inc. QuoteNow, per media reports, recent developments imply that Australian banks after being rebuffed by the country's anti-competition regulator, will give up on their demand for fee removal. Instead these banks will solely focus on ""gaining access to the U.S. tech company's contactless payment function.""Australia and New Zealand Bank had agreed to sign up for Apple Pay last year, while National Australia Bank, Bendigo and Adelaide Bank, Commonwealth Bank of Australia as well as Westpac Banking Corp continued to negotiate with Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC). These banks had asked for a collective negotiating power with Apple over fees and access to the contactless payments technology, which was rejected by ACCC.Reportedly, Macquarie Group Ltd and ING Groep NV's ING Direct are likely to start offering Apple Pay from this month itself.In Sep 2014, Apple unveiled its mobile payment solution, Apple Pay, designed on the basis of a contactless payment technology, to offer a hassle-free experience. The service has now been expanded to 13 markets like the UK, Australia, Canada, China, Hong Kong, Switzerland, Japan, Russia, New Zealand and Spain. In the first quarter of 2017, Apple Pay transactions surged about 500% on a year-over-year basis.At present, Apple has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Apple's shares have marginally outperformed as the broader market over the past one year.

And now, some retailers have stopped carrying Ivanka Trump's brand.Over the last several weeks, corporate America has responded to President Trump's travel ban and other initiatives of the new Trump administration, in a variety of manners. The biggest display came when nearly 130 companies, including AppleAAPL, FacebookFBand MicrosoftMSFT, took to the courts to fight against the controversial travel ban from seven Muslim-majority nations.The Trump Brand BattleMacy'sMstopped selling Donald Trump's line of menswear in Summer 2015, after the then presidential candidate made inflammatory remarks regarding Mexican immigrants.

At the same time, Trump supporters have threatened to stop shopping at businesses that cut ties with any Trump brands.On February 2, Uber CEO Travis Kalanick stepped down from Trump's economic advisory board amid the travel ban fight. The move leaves Tesla'sTSLAElon Musk as the only remaining big-time tech executive still sitting on the board.The battle between corporate America, consumers, the Trump administration and Trump brands is likely just heating up.Grab Your Wallet CampaignShannon Coulter, a San Francisco-based political activist, began the hashtag #GrabYourWallet campaign on social media in November.

The company cited her brand's declining performance as the reason it would no longer be carried, not external political pressure.Nordstrom's stock went upafter the formal announcement.Neiman Marcus dropped Ivanka Trump's high-end jewelry line from its website nearly the same time Nordstrom made the move.

What Happened in the Stock Market Today;2/13/2017;"Stocks drove deeper into record territory on Monday, with both   theDow Jones Industrial Average(DJINDICES: ^DJI) and theS&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) indexes finishing higher by more than 0.5%.Today's stock marketIndexPercentage ChangemakeArticleAd();Point ChangeDow0.70%142.79S&P 5000.52%12.15Data source: Yahoo! Finance.Financial stocks led indexes higher, which pushed the popularFinancial Select Sector SPDR ETF(NYSEMKT: XLF) up 1%. Gold prices continued to bounce around, but   today they trended lower to produce a 4% decline inDirexion Daily Gold Miners Bull 3X ETF(NYSEMKT: NUGT) .Image source: Getty Images.As for individual stocks,Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) andKnoll(NYSE: KNL) each made notable moves on Monday.Apple's new recordApple shares rose to a new high for the first time in almost   two years as the tech titan gained more fans on Wall Street. Twoanalyst notesadded to rising optimism that the company'sfirst revenue uptickin almost a year will be followed by hefty sales and profit gains   ahead.UBS analyst Steve Milunovich argued that Apple's market   capitalization doesn't fully capture the value of its booming   services segment. That highly profitable division grew at a 20%   clip last quarter, and since it's responsible for more than 10%   of sales, the segment is making the company less vulnerable to   the kinds of demand swings that plague pure-play hardware makers.   That means Apple's stock should reflect the premium that services   giants likePayPalenjoy, UBS argued.Separately, analyst Simona Jankowski at Goldman Sachs boosted   her Apple price target from $133 per share to $150 per share,   citing groundbreaking new features that could be part of the   10th-generation iPhone. These likely include 3D-sensing   technology that ""could be the new killer app to reinvigorate   upgrade demand for premium smartphones."" Jankowski raised her   iPhone sales estimates to 230 million units this year, which   would amount to a massive upgrade cycle for the 10-year-old   franchise.Knoll's office space challengeKnoll shares dropped 14% after the office furniture specialist   announced surprisingly weak fourth-quarter results. Sales fell 4%   to $293 million over the holiday quarter to mark a sharp slowdown   from the prior quarter's 11% increase. Consensus estimates were   targeting 3% growth, instead, to $314 million of revenue.The main culprit was an 8% decline in office furniture sales   that the company pegged on sinking office space demand in the   U.S. market. ""We were impacted in the fourth quarter by the   slowdown in demand that has been sweeping across the industry,""   CEO Andrew Cogan said in a press release.Image source: Knoll.There was plenty of good financial news in the report, though.   Expenses plunged by 18%, for example, and gross profit margin   improved as well. Together, these two trends ensured that   operating profit rose despite the smaller sales footprint.   Knoll's bottom-line profitability expanded by more than a full   percentage point to 12% of sales.Looking ahead, Knoll executives believe office space trends   will bounce back. ""We see reasons to be hopeful that with the   uncertainty of the presidential election behind us, demand should   improve later in the year,"" Cogan explained. Investors didn't   project the same optimism, and instead sent the stock sharply   lower, reflecting expectations of more weakness on the horizon in   the workplace furniture market.Offer from The Motley Fool: The 10 best stocks to buy nowMotley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more   than a decade beating the market.

Those trades are underperforming now, resulting in some short covering demand for shares.Given Apple's large cash holdings, there could be a surprise announcement at some point related to capital return to shareholders that could potential push shares toward the $180-a-share level.More modestly,Goldman Sachs upped its price target on AAPL stockto $150, which still is about 14% higher from here.Apple will next report results on April 25 after the close. Analysts are looking for earnings of $2.11 per share on revenues of $54.1 billion.Anthony Mirhaydari is founder of theEdgeandEdge Proinvestment advisory newsletters.

This rumor claims that the 2,700 mAh battery will fit inside a device with a similar form factor to the current 4.7-inch iPhone models. However, the 2,700 mAh battery will give the device a battery life closer to the 5.5-inch devices sold by the company.

KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo is the source of this rumor.iPhone 8 Accessories:Rumor has it that the iPhone 8 won't come with many accessories,MacRumorsnotes. According to this rumor, the tech company won't be including a Lightning to 3.5mm Headphone Jack Adapter with the device.

Alphabet Inc – Is Google Assistant Going Everywhere? (GOOGL);2/13/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAlphabet Inc's(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Pixel Phone holds a significant advantage over third-party Android smartphones. Since its release, Google Assistant - the new AI powered personal assistant - has been a Pixel Phone exclusive. Third-party smartphones remain stuck with the previous generation Google Now. However, Google released an Android ""alpha"" build late last week and the new Android release enables Google Assistant on third-party smartphones.makeArticleAd();Source: GoogleGOOGL's third-party Android smartphone partners have been feeling a little betrayed since the release of the Pixel Phone last fall.Up until then, Google had not been directly competing against them. It developed Android and allowed them to use the operating system on their phones for free - a fair trade off for the hundreds of millions of mobile devices defaulting to revenue-generating Google search. Google did release the Nexus line of smartphones, but they were more of a showcase for Android than an attempt to compete against its partners.The Pixel Phone's Google Assistant AdvantageThe Pixel Phone changed the equation. It was stamped with the Google name for the first time and it was designed to compete head-to-head with the best of the Android smartphones. In another first, a key new Android feature - Google Assistant - was a Pixel Phone exclusive. Google Assistant leverages Alphabet's latest AI technology in a personal digital assistant that goes beyond Google Now, even gaining the ability to participate in two-way conversations.The situation was serious enough to help convince Android smartphone leaderSamsung Electronic Co Ltd(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) that it needed its own personal assistant. Samsung'sBixby is expected to debut on the Galaxy S8.7 Tech Stocks That Are Bucking the DowntrendNew Android Release Spills the Beans: Google Assistant for All?Android Policeexamined a developer ""alpha"" release of Android over the weekend and discovered thatGOOGL may be having a change of heartabout keeping Google Assistant to itself.Its team was able to activate and use Google Assistant on several non-Pixel smartphones, including a Samsung Galaxy Note 5 running Android Marshmallow and a Nexus 6P running Android Nougat.This means that GOOGL is at least experimenting with making Google Assistant available to third-party smartphones in an upcoming new Android release.Where Would This Leave the Pixel Phone?While Google's Pixel Phone has premium design and a very nice camera, its primary advantage over third-party smartphones is the exclusive availability of Google Assistant. Take that away and it's more or less competing on a level footing with the big guns from the likes of Samsung. True, the Pixel Phone is guaranteed Android updates, but that's no different than the Nexus phones.No, Apple Inc. Is Not Releasing the iPhone 8 EarlyWith AI and digital assistants in the spotlight, Google may have decided that having Google Assistant become a standard Android feature is important to maintain its lead overApple Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhones and Siri.I wrote a few days ago about Google's struggle againstAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN)in the smart home. The Amazon Echo and Alexa have taken a huge lead there and Google Assistant on the Google Home speaker and Pixel Phones may not be enough to catch it. If it were to give up its exclusivity and enable Google Assistant on third-party smartphones, GOOGL would suddenly have hundreds of millions of additional devices in play. This would give it far more leverage against Amazon, at the cost of the Pixel Phone competing on a more level playing field.And the company has always marketed the Pixel Phone as being the ""first phone"" with Google Assistant - not the ""only phone"" - leaving the door open for an eventual general roll-out.Of course, at this point we aren't certain that GOOGL will pull the trigger. The new Android release in question is alpha software - that'sbeforebeta. The company may simply be having some developers test Google Assistant compatibility with third-party hardware with no intention of actually opening up the feature. However, hints like the message ""New! You just got the Google Assistant"" suggest that GOOGL is leaning toward ending Pixel Phone exclusivity and rolling out the AI-powered feature as part of a general Android release.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceIs Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Ending the Age of Intel (INTC)?Report: Apple Inc. iPhone 8 Could Cost More Than $1,000 (AAPL)The postAlphabet Inc - Is Google Assistant Going Everywhere?

2 Bullish Analyst Notes Push Apple, Inc. Closer to All-Time Highs;2/13/2017;"It's been nearly two long years, butApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) shares are back at all-time highs last seen in   April 2015. The record trade set back then was $134.54, and   shares are currently trading within pennies of it. Investors have   spent much of the past year fretting about peaking iPhone sales,   with the modest gain posted in the fourth quarter quelling some   concerns.Shares are rising today as at least two Street analysts are   taking bullish stances: Goldman Sachs analyst Simona Jankowski   and UBS analyst Steve Milunovich.Services should be worth moreMilunovich believes that even at record prices, Apple shares   are still undervalued. The analyst points to the company's   services business, believing that investors aren't fully   appreciating the growing segment. For reference, services revenue   comprises 12% of total sales over the past four quarters. While   Apple doesn't break out profitability by segment, services are   generally always higher-margin than hardware. That's particularly   true for the agency model used in the App Store, since Apple only   recognizes the net portion of what it keeps (as opposed to the   wholesale, where Apple must record costs as well, which is used   for iTunes Music downloads).makeArticleAd();Apple Pay is part of Apple's growing portfolio of services.     Image source: Apple.Apple's installed base continues to grow, and the company   enjoys extremely high levels of customer retention. New and   existing customers continue to spend more and more on digital   content and services. The number of customers transacting is   jumping double digits, as is the average revenue per paying   customer; Apple is hoping todouble services revenueover the next four years. Milunovich believes that if the market   were to value Apple's services business in line with other   publicly traded comparable peers, shares would ""be at least 10%   higher.""The analyst reiterated a buy rating this morning alongside a   $138 price target.3D sensing and augmented reality could be the next big   thingJankowski similarly reiterated a buy rating this morning, but   meaningfully increased her price target from $133 to $150.The analyst is bullish on the prospect of this year's   10th-generation iPhone including innovative new features like3D-sensing technologyfromLumentum(NASDAQ: LITE) . The potential iPhone supplier reported earnings   last week and noted on the call that it had ""shipped our first   revenue into what we believe could be a high-volume mobile device   application,"" and that the company is ""very encouraged by the   progress and key milestones achieved to date on this   application."" When pressed further about receiving ""more   visibility into one customer in particular,"" CEO Alan Lowe said   there were multiple mobile device manufacturers that are sampling   the company's offerings. Lowe added: ""I would hate to give away   any of their secrets, and as we start including meaningful   revenue in our guidance, we will talk more and more about it. But   suffice it to say that the milestones that we achieved over the   last six months increase my confidence in our ability to make 3D   sensing a meaningful part of our business as we look   forward.""Jankowski believes that Apple could be using 3D sensing to   implement some type of augmented reality (AR) application, which   CEO Tim Cook has beentalking an awful lot aboutlately. This has the potential to be the next iPhone's killer   feature.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

A Foolish Take: As iPhone Sales Rebound, Apple's CEO Bets on More Smartphone Growth;2/13/2017;"Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) stock has been on a tear recently, rising more   than 20% in the past six months. The stock's sharp rise comes as   the tech giant proves it can still increase its iPhone sales. And   Apple CEO Tim Cook believes more runway for growth for   smartphones will continue to lift the iPhone segment.In Apple's first fiscal quarter of 2017, the tech giant   reported 5% year-over-year growth in both iPhone revenue and unit   sales, reversing a three-quarter streak of declining iPhone sales   -- a sobering trend for a company that generates over 60% of its   revenue from its smartphone business. A return to iPhone growth,   therefore, has been welcomed warmly by investors.Data source: Apple's quarterly operating data. Chart by     author.makeArticleAd();Of course, despite Apple's recent reversal of iPhone sales,   there's still concern that maturing smartphone sales could render   the tech giant's return to growth short-lived. But Cook strongly   disagrees with bearish sentiment toward iPhones.""I think the smartphone is still in the early innings of the   game,"" Cook boldly stated in the company's first-quarter earnings   call. He went on to explain that there's ""lots more to do"" as   smartphones become more integral to people's lives.Offer from the Motley Fool: The 10 best stocks to buy nowMotley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more   than a decade beating the market.

Why Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Holders Shouldn’t Sweat Snapchat;2/13/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsLast month, yours truly here opined thatFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) had nothing to worry about with online messenger rival Snapchat. The service has become big enough to merit its parent company going public as a means of taking Snapchat to the ""next level."" But when all is said and done, I think FB stock - even with its new challenges - still will be the better investment of the two.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockSome new data and details about Snapchat's parent Snap's IPO have materialized in the meantime.After giving that new information some thorough thought, I'm actuallymoreconvinced Facebook stock is the better pick of the two.What's Snapchat?Snapchat, for the unfamiliar, is an internet messaging platform. Its ""shtick"" is simply thatthe posted videos, photos and messages self-destruct a few moments after they're viewed. Its relatively new ""story"" feature will aggregate all your messages over the past 24 hours, but after that, they still vanish.More important, Snapchat has a decent following. As of the latest look, Snapchat boasts 158 million daily users, which means it has a list of158 million consumersthat advertisers can market to. Not bad, particularly given its age. Facebook still dwarfs Snapchat with its 1.23 billion daily users, but Facebook had a multiyear head start andshouldbe bigger.7 Dividend Stocks for the Retirement You DeserveBesides, Snapchat's year-over-year user growth pace wasin the mid-40%s overallas of the fourth quarter of last year. For its most recently-reported quarter, Facebook'sdaily user growth was only up 17% year-over-year. Throw in the fact that advertisers are stoked about the fact that Snapchat is new and chic, and FB stock holders have good reason to be concerned.Thing is, looking beyond the table-pounding bullish rhetoric, Snapchat (and by extension the upcomingSnap IPO) Facebook doesn't really have much to worry about.Losing SteamGiving credit where it's due, Instinet's Anthony DiClemente may have said it best early this week when hereiterated the firm's Facebook stock price target of $165 and ""Buy"" rating:""Snap Inc. appears to be coming public later in its growth cycle than other internet companies, adding just 5mn global daily active users (DAUs) last quarter, demonstrating just 3% sequential growth. By contrast, at the time of their respective IPOs, Facebook and Twitter were growing nearly twice as fast. During 2016, Snapchat added 51mn DAUs, globally; by comparison, Facebook added 190mn DAUs in 2016. Our checks indicate that Facebook maintains a substantial lead in mobile app downloads… We come away reassured that Facebook maintains the ability to mitigate competitive threats via product innovation […] Snapchat's user growth decelerated through 2H16, following the launch of Instagram Stories.""In other words, when Facebook went public back in 2012, it was picking up steam. Snap is decelerating as it moves into its IPO.It's not just the notion that most social networking and messaging users have already made their choice that bodes poorly for Snap, however. There's also the nagging reality that the strength of Snapchat's advertising model is still an unknown quality. Some of what we do know, however, isn't encouraging.Case in point: In November, AdAge reported that the average video ad shown via Snapchat was viewed less than three seconds before that viewer skipped past it. That's not enough to pay off for an advertiser.Oh,and let's not forget that Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerbergonce offered to acquire Snapchat for $3 billion. When Snap's chiefs said no,Zuck boughtInstagraminstead, and is now using it to club Snapchat into submission.Snapchat's growth pace was almost cut in halfafter Instagram's ""Stories"" - comparable to Snapchat's ""Story"" - was launched.Why Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Can Hit Goldman's $150 TargetAnd if the recent rise of Facebook stock is any indication, the market agrees Snapchat just isn't going to play the role of David to the Goliath that Facebook is. FB stock is up 16% since the end of 2016 against a backdrop of Snap buzz.Bottom Line for FB StockCalling a spade a spade, Snapchat is a wannabe, jumping into the messaging fray when the premise of messaging was hot even if the business model wasn't proven. As is so often the case, though, the wannabe simply can't dethrone the entrenched powerhouse.That's not to say owners of FB stock have nothing to worry about.Chief Financial Officer David Wehner recently acknowledged, ""We continue to expect ad revenue growth rate will come down meaningfully (in 2017)."" It is to say, though, the established cash cow can easily fend off Snapchat.The Snap IPO isn't as much a fundraiser to arm the company as it is an exit strategy for its insiders who didn't want to sell to Facebook five years ago.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceCan the Snapchat IPO Show Investors the Money?7 Stocks to Buy That Could Double by 20185 Income Tax Deductions You Can't Afford to MissThe postWhy Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Holders Shouldn't Sweat Snapchatappeared first onInvestorPlace."

iShares Russell 2000 Index (ETF) (IWM) Is About to Break Out;2/13/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBuyers continue to reign on Wall Street. Large-cap indices across the board tagged new all-time highs last week. But what's particularly interesting heading into the new week is the mega-breakout looming in small-caps. TheRussell 2000Index and its accompanying ETF - theiShares Russell 2000 Index (ETF)(NYSEARCA:IWM) - are poised to play some catch-up.makeArticleAd();Since screaming higher following the election, IWM has been in a two-month holding pattern. Let's call it a high base, and a tight one at that. For all its shaking and baking, the IWM ETF has remained stuck in a 3.6% range between $133.50 and $138.50. With Friday's pop, small-caps are now testing the top-end of the range.And since the rest of the broad market indices have already soared to new heights, I see little reason why the Russell 2000 can't follow suit.One of the reasons why breakout patterns appeal to the chart-watching class is the ease with which trades can be built around them. A common trigger is to enter bullish trades once the stock finally succeeds in breaking above resistance. Such a victory is telling. It signals that buyers have finally mustered the strength to breach a ceiling that was previously unbreachable.7 High-Risk, High-Reward Stocks to Buy NowThat type of force often results in multiple days of follow-through until the buying binge eventually exhausts itself.Click to EnlargeSource: OptionsAnalytixFor IWM, the level to watch going into the new week is $138.82. Although Friday's rally rose above a few minor resistance levels, $138.82 remains the all-time high for the fund.This price needs to broken for the bullish party to begin in earnest.Embrace Small-Caps for Big ProfitsWith implied volatility circling the drain, long option trades remain a cheap way to grab exposure to IWM. Buy the April $138/$143 bull call spread for around $2.25. The $5-wide vertical consists of buying the $138 call while selling the $143 call. The initial cost of $2.25 represents the max risk and will be forfeited if IWM sits below $138 at expiration.To minimize the damage, you could consider exiting if IWM falls below the lower end of its range at $134. A decline below that threshold will invalidate any breakout attempt.On the profit side, the IWM call vertical spread offers $2.75 of potential reward that you will capture if the ETF can rise above $143 by expiration.As of this writing, Tyler Craig owned bullish positions on IWM.More From InvestorPlaceGo Long Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

Dow ETF Tops Asset Flow: 5 Stocks Behind The Surge;2/13/2017;"U.S. bourses hit yet another high on Friday and logged in the third weekly gain. In particular, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is the biggest beneficiary of the rotation in leadership in the large cap domestic space. The index topped the 20,000 milestone for the first time on January 25 and then retreated on concerns over Trump's protectionist action and lack of clarity on policy reforms (read:Market Hitting New Highs: Bargain ETFs & Stocks to Buy Now).makeArticleAd();However, the optimism returned in the last couple of days following Trump's talks of tax cuts and infrastructure spending. This reignited a post-election rally that is expected to continue on renewed hopes that Trump is acting on his pro-growth promises. Further, the continuation of friendly U.S. and Japan  trade ties thanks to an amicable Trump-Abe's meeting has eased nervousness relating to the currency policy, which dominated the market for weeks. With this, the President put his focus back on boosting economic growth and a strong dollar.Trump has already enacted a slew of his proposed reforms including deregulation. This has bolstered confidence and increased investors' risk appetite.Another major catalyst is solid corporate Q4 earnings. As per the latestEarnings Preview, the Q4 earnings season is faring better than recent years with not only earnings growth set to reach the highest level in two years but total earnings for the quarter on track to hit a new record, surpassing the previous record achieved in Q4 of 2014.ThoughSPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETFDIAtracking the index has gained immense popularity since the election, it pulled in the maximum amount of money last week among the other large cap ETFs.

Go Long Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock … With Insurance!;2/13/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsLast year's turnaround inAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMD) is back in play and looking good for investors. But with key product rollouts looming, don't be too Zen about the trend being your friend. Instead, control your destiny with a little insurance against AMD stock.makeArticleAd();Source:Matthew Rutledge via FlickrAs I wrotelast monthin front of earnings, 2016 was the best of times for AMD stock, and for good reason. Of course, 2017 is looking good as shares continue to gain on the company's improving business trend. Shares were catapulted to new multiyear highs after fourth-quarter earnings topped Wall Street's views.Still, the rest of the year is looking like make-or-break time for the semiconductor outfit for two reasons: Ryzen and Vega.Ryzen is set to be released in early March as Advanced Micro Devices' new CPU for PCs and servers. The main competition is chip giantIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) - a company facing itsown design challengesand whose manufacturing lead will shrink markedly with the release of Ryzen.On the conference call, Advanced Micro Devices teased investors, stating it had secured a number of high-end PC design wins for Ryzen, which is based on AMD's next-gen Zen CPU core architecture.Advanced Micro Devices is also releasing its Vega GPU line in 2017. The product is expected to come to market during the second quarter and has its sights on gaining market share in the server and high-end PC markets.7 High-Risk, High-Reward Stocks to Buy NowThe big competition in this space isNvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA). Nvidia's software dominance will be a substantial challenge for AMD to crack, but one it's readying for with an open-source approach.Advanced Micro Devices must successfully execute for AMD stock to have any chance to keep building on its red-hot 2017. If not, it would undo a significant amount of price action.AMD Stock ChartClick to EnlargeSince discussing AMD back in January (yellow oval highlight), shares have confirmed what we saw as a fairly common corrective move by blasting higher to new multiyear highs.It goes without saying that the price action has been very generous for AMD investors. But notwithstanding the company's obvious business risks, there's no reason to believe the stock's bullish trend won't still be friendly, and won't still improve.The better part of last week has been spent digesting the bullish gains in AMD stock, though not to point of finding support from an overbought stochastics. It's a minor concern. My technical point of view? AMD's constructive price action and potential for improvement outweighs this secondary price indicator.How to Trade AMD Stock Right NowWith AMD stock at $13.58, I like the April $17/$12 collar.The collar - priced for $13.78, or 20 cents over a naked long stock purchase - allows for guaranteed downside protection at $12 and amounts to an effective stop-loss of about 13%.Why Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Can Hit Goldman's $150 TargetThe insurance policy afforded by the $12 put is stationed a few percent below December's highs in AMD and pennies under the post-earnings closing print. The protection could come in handy.If bullish momentum does prevail, profits are initially capped by the $17 call. At April expiration, that works out to a gain of more than 23% if shares are at or above the sold strike. Those profits nearly double the downside risk for a premium of just 20 cents.Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in any of the securities or their derivatives mentioned in this article.

Trading Freeport-McMoRan Inc (FCX) Stock’s Battle with Indonesia;2/13/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsDriven by rising metals prices and uncertainty surrounding global metals trade,Freeport-McMoRan Inc(NYSE:FCX) kicked off 2017 with a bang. FCX stock surged more than 26% in January, hitting a fresh 52-week high in the process. But unsavory developments at its most profitable mine, the Grasberg mine in Indonesia, have created quite a stir for Freeport-McMoRan investors so far in February.makeArticleAd();Source:Nick Bastian via Flickr (Modified)The question is, ""Is it time to double down on FCX stock, or bail on the shares until the Grasberg situation rights itself?""The Grasberg mine is the world's most productive gold mine and the second-most-productive copper mine. It also Freeport's biggest revenue generator. The trouble revolves aroundmining and export permitswith the Indonesian government.Specifically, the government is happy to issue a new mining permit, but is balking on the original terms of the export agreement - which included lax export taxes. Freeport says it needs the original agreement in for its long-term investment plans to work out.So far, there is no deal, though Freeport remains hopeful an agreement will be reached.7 Dividend Stocks for the Retirement You DeserveIn the meantime, copper prices spiked on Friday, and are likely to continue higher afterBHP Billiton Limited (ADR)(NYSE:BHP) declared force majeure at its Escondida mine in Chile, the world's biggest copper mine. Production at Escondida is now on hold, and copper prices surged 4.6% following the news.The jump in copper was a boon for FCX stock, which added 2.6% on Friday - though the shares are still down more than 3% month-to-date. Technically, support lies in the $15 region for Freeport-McMoRan, with 50-day moving average providing additional leverage for the shares. Resistance is thick in the $16.50-$17 region, however, and likely won't fall unless the Grasberg mine situation is resolved favorably.Sentiment is understandably mixed as a result. Thomson/First Call reports that 13 of the 20 analysts following FCX stock rate the shares a ""hold"" and the 12-month consensus price target of $14.76 represents a discount to Freeport-McMoran's close on Friday. In short, the resolution of the Grasberg mine issue could elicit a round of upgrades or downgrades depending on how things play out.Click to EnlargeSurprisingly, FCX options traders have sided firmly with the bulls. Currently, the March put/call open interest ratio comes in at 0.58, with calls nearly doubling puts among FCX options set to expire within the next two months. What's more, the most popular March strike is the $18 call, where more than 30,000 currently reside.Volatility is also notably brisk for FCX stock. March implieds are pricing in a potential move of more than 11% for the shares, placing the upper bound at $17.59 and the lower bound near $14. If the Grasberg mine situation plays out unfavorably, $14 is a definite possibility, while the upper bound near $17.59 could fall in short order on a positive outcome - especially given BHP's trouble in Escondida.2 Trades for FCX StockCall Spread:With March calls leaning toward a bull run for FCX, I'm inclined to side with the majority here. Traders looking to bet on a resumption of January's rally might want to consider a March $16/$17 bull call spread. At last check, this spread was offered at 37 cents, or $37 per pair of contracts. Breakeven lies at $16.37, while a maximum profit of 63 cents, or $63 per pair of contracts, is possible if FCX stock closes at or above $16 when March options expire.Why Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Can Hit Goldman's $150 TargetPut Spread:On the other hand, Indonesia has been stubborn when it comes to the Grasberg mine in the past, and a holdout on a deal could weigh heavily on FCX stock. Traders siding with the bears might want to consider a March $14/$15 bear put spread. At last check, this spread was also offered at 29 cents, or $29 per pair of contracts.Breakeven lies at $14.69, while a maximum profit of 69 cents, or $69 per pair of contracts, is possible if FCX stock closes at or below $14 when March options expire.As of this writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 Super-Safe Dividend Growth Stocks to Buy Today7 High-Risk, High-Reward Stocks to Buy NowThe postTrading Freeport-McMoRan Inc (FCX) Stock's Battle with Indonesiaappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Why Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Can Hit Goldman’s $150 Target;2/13/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIs it too late to bite into shares ofApple, Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL), which last week hit a new 52-week high? That has been the question rolling around investors' minds amid a 10% run for AAPL stock over the past month, and a 22% gain over the past quarter.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');Source: ShutterstockIt's increasingly difficult to find a nice entry point in Apple stock, and that's truer today, with shares set to rise again on a price-target upgrade from Goldman Sachs.Goldman analyst Simona Jankowski just raised the firm's PT on AAPL stock from $133 to $150, implying another 14% or so in upside from here. Her comments:""Last week's industry datapoints (e.g. from optical supplier Lumentum) suggest that the inclusion of 3D sensing functionality is increasingly likely, which could enable a robust augmented reality [AR] feature set that we believe will be a key differentiator for the 10-year anniversary iPhone. This is a significant step-up in innovation vs. the prior two product cycle, especially when viewed in conjunction with the potential significant form factor change enabled by the move to an OLED display (e.g. removal of the bezels and the home button).""Apple shares finished Friday at $132.13 - a 2.4% gain for the week. And $150 seems like an easy target for the stock to reach.Why AAPL Stock Can Hit $150A combination of factors are driving the increase. Notably, the market now seems less pessimistic about the adverse impact Donald Trump's presidency might have on tech companies, including other mega-caps likeAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) andFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB).7 Dividend Stocks for the Retirement You DeserveIn the case of Apple, though, aside from the company's strong first-quarter fiscal 2017 earnings last month, AAPL stock is also driven by speculation that the company's next product cycle might be ahead of schedule.And not only are there rumors that Apple may release its iPhone 8 earlier than its normal September launch date, the iPhone 8 - the device's anniversary edition - may be priced ""north of $1,000"" and could be called the ""iPhone X,"" according toFast Company.What's more, the design of iPhone 8 (or iPhone X) - which Fast Company said will ""look something like a smooth black monolith, with few visual interruptions to its design"" - is expected to encompass a drastic departure from what consumers have become accustomed to. The physical buttons on the phone's sides are likely gone and will be replaced with metal inlays.Apple is rumored to relocate the home button, putting it under the display. And the new device, which may finally support wireless charging, might not have the rounded edges its predecessors have had. These enhancements were reported by MacRumors, which cited a note from KCI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who said Apple's iPhone 8 will have a new 3D Touch module.These potential catalysts have forced Wall Street to adjust their models, prompting several bullish calls from the likes of Bank of America, which also recently raised its price target on AAPL stock to $145 from $140.Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Stock Has Become a Short TargetMichael Walkley, Canaccord Genuity analyst, lifted his price target to $154 from $142, saying, ""we believe Apple will extend its leading market share of the premium-tier smartphone market installed base during 2017.""Bottom Line for AAPL StockIf Apple was able to sell a more than 78 million phones in 2016's holiday quarter, just imagine what it could do in this year's holiday quarter given the feature-rich qualities the new iPhone 8 (or whatever it will be called) will have.As such, $150 to $155 now seems like a realistic target for AAPL stock by the end of the year, representing a 14% to 18% move.Combined with Apple's 1.7% yield, that's excellent value.As of this writing, Richard Saintvilus did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceQualcomm, Inc.

Qualcomm, Inc. (QCOM) Stock: Is the Worst Over?;2/13/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAll's fair in love and war .. and apparently business, at least until you get caught and sued, that it. That's the situation leading wireless communications chipmakerQualcomm, Inc.(NASDAQ:QCOM) finds itself in right now. The company is being sued by both the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) andApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) for allegedunfair licensing practices and monopolistic behavior. QCOM stock has taken a serious hit in the wake of these lawsuits, leaving many to wonder if the worst has already been factored in.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockToday, we have a pair of trade ideas for those eyeing the bullish side of QCOM.The aforementioned lawsuits, combined with additional selling pressure due to a poor showing withfirst-quarter earnings, has Qualcomm stock trading down more than 18% so far in 2017. But the shares showed some signs of bouncing back on Friday, with QCOM bouncing off support near $52 and reclaiming its 10-day moving average in the process.Bargain hunting is the most likely culprit, as QCOM stock traded in oversold territory for roughly a week heading into Friday's session. If the market has decided the worst is now factored into shares, the stock could have plenty of short-term upside.Take Qualcomm's sentiment backdrop, for example. Despite the lawsuits and poor earnings showing, the stock has yet to see a single ""sell"" rating from the brokerage bunch. According to Thomson/First Call, there are 14 ""holds"" and 16 ""buy"" ratings levied at QCOM stock, and the 12-month consensus price target is holding at $65.53 - a full 21% north of the shares' current perch.7 Marvelous Mid-Cap Stocks to Buy for the Best of All WorldsWhat's more, short sellers are abandoning QCOM in droves. During the most recent reporting period, the number of shares sold short plunged 9% to 12.4 million, representing less than 1% of the stock's total float. With short sellers jumping ship, it's a good bet that worst is already priced in - and Qualcomm could be headed higher once more.Click to EnlargeQCOM options traders, meanwhile, have taken up a bearish stance. Currently, the March put/call open interest ratio rests at 1.08, with puts and calls in near-parity. That said, the biggest spike in OI in the March series has been at the $50 strike, and appears to be almost entirely made up of sell-to-open activity, indicating bullish-to-neutral put sell action.Checking in with March implieds, options are pricing in a potential move of about 6% for QCOM in the coming month. This places the upper bound at $57.20, while the lower bound rests near $50.80.In short, the March $50 strike appears to be an excellent place for put selling activity, while a rally to $57.20 would leave the shares well short of overhead resistance near $60.2 Trades for QCOM StockCall Spread:For those looking to bet on a short-term comeback for QCOM stock, a March $55/$57.50 bull call spread has some impressive profit potential. At last check, this spread was offered at 57 cents, or $57 per pair of contracts.Breakeven lies at $55.57, while a maximum profit of $1.93, or $193 per pair of contracts, is possible if QCOM stock trades at or above $57.50 when March options expire next month.Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Stock Has Become a Short TargetPut Sell:If you're more inclined to follow the bullish-to-neutral crowd when it comes to QCOM, then the March $50 put sell should finish out of the money. At last check, this put was bid at 38 cents, or $38 per contract.Remember that you keep the initial premium received as long as QCOM stock closes above $50 when March options expire. However, if QCOM trades below $50 ahead of expiration, you could be assigned 100 shares for every put sold at a cost of $50 per share.As of this writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceBlackBerry Ltd (BBRY) Might Actually Make Money Again Someday7 Dividend Stocks for the Retirement You Deserve7 Stocks That Will Drop by 10% or More This QuarterThe postQualcomm, Inc.

Monday’s Vital Data: Nvidia Corporation (NVDA), Twitter Inc (TWTR) and Activision Blizzard, Inc. (ATVI);2/13/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsU.S. stock futures are trending higher this morning, as Wall Street looks toward softening trade rhetoric from the White House on Japan and China. Furthermore, while there is a lack of economic data, President Donald Trump is scheduled to meet with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. On the corporate front,Verizon Communications Inc.(NYSE:VZ) is making headlines after offering its first unlimited wireless data plan since 2011.makeArticleAd();At last check, futures on theDow Jones Industrial Averagewere up 0.27%, withS&P 500futures rising 0.22% andNasdaq-100futures up 0.16%.On the options front, volume was brisk on Friday, with about 17.3 million calls and 14.8 million puts changing hands on the session. Over on the CBOE, the single-session equity put/call volume ratio rose to 0.70, but the 10-day moving average ticked lower to 0.70.Turning to Friday's volume leaders,Nvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA) saw mixed options activity and dropped 2.4% on Friday despite posting record holiday quarter earnings results. Meanwhile,Twitter Inc(NYSE:TWTR) puts were active after the company logged its 10th straight year-over-year drop in quarterly revenue andActivision Blizzard, Inc.(NASDAQ:ATVI) announced blowout results and a $1 billion buyback program.Nvidia Corporation (NVDA)Nvidia traders were looking for a reason - any reason - to take profits off the table after the stock returned to all-time-high territory near $120 last week. And they got it inThursday night's quarterly report. Despite record earnings of 99 cents per share and sales of $2.2 billion - both of which beat Wall Street's targets of 83 cents per share on revenue of $2.1 billion - traders instead focused on Nvidia's conservative first-quarter guidance of $1.9 billion (plus or minus two percentage points), versus expectations for $1.88 billion.NVDA stock dropped nearly 2.4%, pushing the shares below their 10-day moving average and driving heavy put volume heading into the weekend. In total, NVDA saw 828,000 contracts cross the tape on Friday, with puts and calls nearly split on the session.That said, NVDA is still trading north of peak Feb call and put open interest at $110, which totals 9,000 and 14,000 contracts, respectively. Additionally, while put adds were seen building at the Feb $107 strike, so too were traders targeting the Feb $115 call strike. Once profit taking plays out, NVDA should begin to move higher once again.Twitter Inc (TWTR)TWTR stock continued to see fallout from itsdisastrous fourth-quarter earnings report. The struggling social media firm logged its 10th straight year-over-year quarterly decline and its slowest revenue growth since it went public four years ago.Many TWTR bulls were hoping that Twitter would get a ""Trump bump"" from the political stir President Donald Trump has caused since his election, but ad revenue from the increased Twitter attention didn't materialize.The poor report sent many scrambling for the exits, and TWTR options traders flooded the stock with puts on Friday. Total volume rose to 609,000 contracts, with calls snapping up 55% of the day's take. Twitter is now trading at its lowest point since June last year, with the dip below $16 threatening to push the stock below peak Feb put OI of nearly 20,000 contracts at the $15 strike.And there are plenty of put traders looking for just such a break later this week, with 11,800 Feb $13 put contracts and another 7,200 puts open at the Feb $14 strike. TWTR stock is trading slightly higher in premarket action this morning, and it may be only a matter of time before takeover and buyout rumors start swirling once again.Activision Blizzard, Inc. (ATVI)With graphics chip makersAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMD) and Nvidia reporting record holiday profits, it should come as no surprise that one of the largest video game makers in the world would also post a blowout quarter. Activision Blizzard said itearned 92 cents per share in the fourth quarter, besting the consensus by 19 cents. Revenue also topped the Street's view, coming in at $2.45 billion.Trade of the Day: Play a Torrid Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock RallyBut while ATVI surged nearly 19% on Friday, options traders didn't appear to be chasing the stock. Total volume came in at 316,000 contracts, with calls only managing 52% of the day's take. In fact, puts easily outnumber calls in the Feb series, indicating that ATVI options traders are looking for a correction or a pullback in short order.That said, ATVI is trading well north of all major call and put OI in both the Feb and March series, and it could be a bit before options traders adjust to the stock's new perch in the $47 region.As of this writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 Super-Safe Dividend Growth Stocks to Buy Today7 Marvelous Mid-Cap Stocks to Buy for the Best of All WorldsThe postMonday's Vital Data: Nvidia Corporation (NVDA), Twitter Inc (TWTR) and Activision Blizzard, Inc.

BlackBerry Ltd (BBRY) Might Actually Make Money Again Someday;2/13/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsRememberBlackBerry Ltd(NASDAQ:BBRY)? Yes, BBRY is still in the game. It's in a minor league, a software and services league, but it's still trying to play.makeArticleAd();Source:WEi WEi via FlickrBlackBerry stock is up a little so far this month, as the company has signed licensing deals around the world, one of which will result in a phonebeing shown at the next Mobile World Congress. BBRY is also getting a push higher in Monday's premarket trading.The company is like a faded star plotting a comeback by playing in tiny bars. But, under CEO John Chen, formerly ofSybase, there is also something now that didn't exist for a long time: hope for a profit.Whether you, as an investor, should be betting on that hope is another matter. But, there is hope for BBRY stock.7 Tech Stocks That Are Bucking the DowntrendHope in SecurityBlackBerry used to be a name to reckon with, a big player in mobility, back when it was all about e-mail and voice, back beforeApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) grabbed the market.Watch early seasons ofThe Good Wife, a CBS legal drama launched in 2009, and you'll see BlackBerry devices in every hand until, without any discussion, they suddenly disappeared late in the run.BlackBerry had a reputation for security. President Obamahad to use a BlackBerrybecause it was considered more secure. All the nonsense about Hillary Clinton and her e-mails involved use of a BlackBerry.Security is still the company's calling card. This month,BBRY launched a software development kitaimed at helping enterprises secure their messaging, voice and video traffic. The hope is that it can compete withTwilio Inc(NYSE:TWLO), a cloud-based messaging system I profiledearlier this month, and whose market cap of $3 billion compares with BlackBerry's $3.87 billion.There is, unfortunately, less to this than meets the eye.Stripped Down and Sobered UpChen has gotten out of areas where it costs money to compete, like hardware, and focused on extracting cash from the company's old software. He has licensed BBRY's key software to companies in China, Indonesia and India, takingas little as $1 per deviceto get the BlackBerry brand back on the market.The consensus among analysts is that BlackBerry will report a narrow loss of just three cents per share and revenue of $295.8 million when it next reports earnings on March 21. Profits might then follow.Chen has drastically shrunk the balance sheet over the last year and cut debt to less than 25% of assets. The asset base at the end of October was barely half of what it was a year earlier, but with just $607 million in debt on $3.35 billion in assets, there's a real company there.7 High-Risk, High-Reward Stocks to Buy NowBy licensing old software, which only needs to be maintained, and by putting it into the cloud as a low-cost security offering, Chen hopes to resurrect BBRY as a profitable secure messaging vendor.The problem lies in one word: old. Software does not age well. Applications from the last decade, no matter how good their claimed security, are not going to be as powerful or flexible as those that are being custom-designed for today's clouds and devices. I think BlackBerry's dreams of competing with Twilio are just that - dreams.Bottom Line for BlackBerry StockBlackBerry has a lot of dreams right now, though. It dreams of having Asian companies bring its once-valuable trademark back to popularity by putting it into cheap Android hardware with local branding. It dreams of being a cloud-based security vendor. It dreams of immigrant developers choosing to join it instead of an American company,thanks to Trump.I'm an old man with dreams, too.

Consumers' 5 Most Beloved Companies;2/13/2017;"makeArticleAd();Market-research agency MBLM has released its 2017Brand Intimacy Report, seeking to understand the part that emotion plays in successful   companies. The report reveals that the top brands ""are exemplars   in building emotional bonds and deep connections with their   customers and creating stronger attachment and engagement.""This deeper relationship leads to stronger financial   performance, as these companies enjoy higher revenue and earnings   than their peers; the study reveals that the stock prices of the   top companies significantly outperformed theS&P 500. It also provides insights into specific demographics such asmillennialsorbaby boomers. Break out the hearts and flowers, as we look at the companies   that have the greatest emotional attachment for consumers.NFLX, HOG, AMZN, DIS, AAPL, SPY Price Percentage Change data   byYCharts.Netflix is most-loved among the 18-34 year demographic.     Image source: Netflix.5. Netflix, Inc.The report found that escapist brands performed well over the   past year. With nearly 50 million U.S. subscribers,Netflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) may provide one of the most popular forms of   escape. Our ubiquitous streaming provider had the highest   percentage of ""bonding"" customers -- those that express   acceptance and trust of the company. It jumped from 25th place to   5th place in the last year, yet was only listed as an intimate   brand by those aged 18-34. This represents a huge future   opportunity, as Netflix is revered by a significant percentage of   the youngest portion of the population. The phrase ""Netflix and   chill"" entering the popular lexicon is an indication of the reach   of this company into pop culture, and the loving feelings of   customers for one of our favorite purveyors of entertainment.A favorite brand among 45- to 64-year olds. Image source:     Pixabay.4. Harley-Davidson, Inc.TheHarley-Davidson(NYSE: HOG) brand is iconic and steeped in Americana. This   company provides distraction of another variety. The report notes   that ""Harley-Davidson offers escape on the road, freedom and   solitary time."" Harley was only listed as an intimate brand by   those aged 45 to 64. It has a higher price point than some   competitors, and distinctive designs give the brand an image of   exclusivity, resulting in an extremely fervent following among a   small percentage of the population. It should be noted that this   company is the exception among consumer favorites, having   underperformed the S&P 500 over the three-, five-, and   10-year periods. We still love you, bro.Amazon is loved across all demographics! Image source:     Amazon.com.3. Amazon.com, Inc.The largest e-commerce company in the world,Amazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN)  was one of two brands that were the most   successful in eliciting emotion across all ages and income   brackets. It also offers escapism similar to Netflix via its   Prime Video streaming service. Analysts estimate that Amazon has   Prime members in more than half the households in the   U.S. With its ability to provide all things to all people,   Amazon can often be found gracing the lists of companies with the   best customer service, as well. This alone may account for a   great many of customers' expressions of amour for this   company.The Happiest Place on Earth. Image source: Author.2. The Walt Disney CompanyDisney(NYSE: DIS) ranked highest for nostalgia -- as the report says,   ""memories of the past and the warm, poignant feelings associated   with them."" The House of Mouse has been providing entertainment   and escape for generations of fans since it first releasedSnow White and the Seven Dwarfsback in 1937. It has also continued to grow with fans, adding   such favorites as theStar Warsand Marvel Studios movies in recent years. This shows, as it   ranked No. 1 among millennials and No. 3 among those aged 35 to   44. With a strong showing among the youngest consumers, this   translates to opportunities for relationships with the next   generation of fans.Apple is the most beloved brand. Image source: Apple,     Inc.1. Apple, Inc.Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) was the most beloved brand in the survey. With its   cultlike following and consistent marks for quality and user   appeal, it most successfully crossed age, gender, and income   boundaries. Apple scored highest in a variety of measures in the   report, including enhancement (becoming better through use of the   brand), ritual (ingraining the brand in daily activity), and   identity (reflecting an aspirational image). It ranked highest in   the fusing category, in which the identities of the customer and   the brand are ""inexorably linked."" It also ranked highest under   ""can't live without it"" and ""frequency of use."" According to the   report, ""Electronics are the things that surround you and involve   you with the world,"" and nobody does electronics better than   Apple. It brings ""connected"" to a whole new level.Investor takeawayAccording to Mario Natarelli, MLBM's managing partner: ""The   underpinning of intimacy is the closer you get to your customer,   the better. That's not a new idea."" As each of the companies on   this list demonstrates, there are a multitude of ways to reach   your customers on an emotional level. Be it by escaping,   connecting, or nostalgia, it isn't so much how you establish that   relationship, it's that you do. When consumers feel the love,   they will show you the money.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Stock Has Become a Short Target;2/13/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsShares ofNvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA) dropped last Friday following the company's latest financial results. NVDA stock, which was one of the hottest stocks of 2016, declined following results in what I deem a classic ""pop-and-drop"" move.makeArticleAd();When bullishness reaches extremes in any given stock, index, commodity or currency, an inevitable period of consolidation (if not an outright correction) sets in. While it is too early to tell which will be the case for NVDA stock at this juncture, following last Friday's post-earnings move, active investors and traders would be wise to respect both sides.On Thursday, Feb. 9, Nvidia reported fourth-quarter earnings of $1.13 per share on revenues of $2.17 billion. Impressively, sales were higher by 55% year-over-year and higher by 8% sequentially. These numbers were great by just about any measure, yet analyst expectations of future results had also risen sky-high.When the going gets too good, investors inevitably exhaust their buying efforts - and upside becomes limited.NVDA Stock ChartsBefore looking closer at last Friday's pop-and-drop in Nvidia shares, let's first gain some perspective from the multiyear weekly chart.Click to EnlargeHere we clearly see the stock's near-vertical ascent in 2016, which has its MACD momentum oscillator at the bottom of the chart dramatically overbought.7 Dividend Stocks for the Retirement You DeserveTo clarify, just because a momentum oscillator is ""overbought"" does not mean a stock can't continue to move higher. In fact, one could have made the ""overbought"" argument through this lens for most of the second half of last year. And look at what happened.NVDA stock continues to trend higher, but last December, a red exhaustion candle appeared on the weekly chart. The stock then paused for a few weeks but began to rally again over the past three weeks. Last Friday's pop-and-drop move left another bearish candle behind on the weekly chart right around the same spot as the December highs (near the $120 mark).On the daily chart, we see that Nvidia stock rose steadily over the past couple of weeks (nearly 20%) as investors and traders bid up the stock ahead of its earnings report.Click to EnlargeThrough the lens of investor psychology, I would argue that this resembled late-comer traders who wanted to possibly profit from another post-earnings rally.On Friday, NVDA managed to stay in the green for a paltry 20 minutes after the earnings report, but enthusiasm was quickly greeted with sellers. After it was all said and done, Nivida shares closed about 2.4% lower on the day, cleanly rejecting the highs from last December.Hate Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock, But Love This TradeLess risk-averse traders could now try to play NVDA stock from the short side using last Friday's intraday highs and an initial profit target near $105.Alternatively, traders could either wait for another follow-through selling day to initiate small short positions.

Apple's iPhone Loses the China Sales Crown: 3 Reasons It Doesn't Matter;2/12/2017;"Cue the blaring headlines about howApple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) iPhone is doomed in China.Late last month, Counterpoint Research stated that the   best-selling smartphone of 2016 in China wasnot an iPhone. The last time an iPhone didn't hold the top spot was 2012. Last   week, IDC piled on, reporting that the iPhone continued to lose   market share in China last quarter, posting a double-digit sales   decline.Various pundits have highlighted these recent reports,   claiming that they show Apple is in trouble in China. However,   the decline in iPhone sales last year was neither shocking nor   alarming -- and Apple is likely to return to strong growth in   China later this year.makeArticleAd();iPhone sales declined significantly in China in 2016. Image     source: Apple.The proliferation of models dilutes salesOne big reason an iPhone wasn't the top-selling phone in China   last year is that Apple is selling more models there than ever   before. A few years ago, two or at most three iPhones would have   accounted for virtually all of the iPhones sold in China in a   given year. By contrast, Apple sold at least eight different   iPhones at various points during 2016.This proliferation of models is mainly an outgrowth of Apple's   decision to start building 4.7- and 5.5-inch versions of each   year's flagship iPhone. Additionally, Apple's September release   schedule for new iPhones means that its shipments in each year   are split between multiple models.Indeed, Apple shipped 44.9 million iPhones in China last year,   according to IDC. Yet it shipped only around 12 million units of   the iPhone 6s, its best-selling model of 2016. Two or three years   ago it would have been unthinkable that the top-selling iPhone   accounted for less than 30% of total iPhone shipments in   China.Revenue has already stabilized in Mainland ChinaLast quarter, Apple reported that its revenue in the Greater   China region fell 12% year over year. That would seem to line up   with the recent IDC report, which found that iPhone shipments   were down 12.8% year over year in China during the quarter.iPhone sales in China are already starting to stabilize.     Image source: Apple.However, on Apple's earnings call, CEO Tim Cook stated that   within Mainland China, revenue was flat last quarter. The big   declines mainly came from Hong Kong. Furthermore, on a   constant-currency basis, Apple's sales in Mainland China   increased 6% year over year.Rising sales for the iPad, Mac, and Apple's services   businesses drove this solid performance. However, given that   iPhone sales dwarf all of these other product lines combined,   it's possible that iPhone shipments didn't fall as much as the   preliminary IDC estimate indicated.The next-gen iPhone could be a smashing successThese first two issues suggest that pundits may be   exaggerating the severity of last year's iPhone sales decline in   China to some extent. Nevertheless, it's indisputable that iPhone   sales fell. The bigger problem with these analyses is that they   ignore the strong cyclical trend in iPhone sales that has emerged   in China in recent years.Up until 2014 or thereabouts, Apple's growth in China was   mainly driven by the growth of the middle class and the addition   of new iPhone carrier partners. Revenue in Greater China surged   78% in fiscal 2012 as Apple began selling the iPhone throughChina Telecom, which nearly doubled its addressable market in China.Revenue growth in Greater China slowed to 13% in fiscal 2013   and 17% in fiscal 2014. The uptick in growth in fiscal 2014 was   surprisingly small, given that Apple addedChina Mobile-- with its nearly 800 million subscribers -- as a carrier   partner during that year.The problem was that the iPhone 5s looked almost identical to   the prior-generation iPhone 5. Since iPhones function as status   symbols in China, most potential buyers want one thatlooks distinct from older models. They got that with the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, which both   were significantly larger than any of Apple's previous iPhone   models. This helped Apple grow its revenue in Greater China by   84% -- nearly $27 billion -- in fiscal 2015.By contrast, the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus looked very much   like their predecessors. (The main draw was the addition of a   ""rose gold"" color option.) The iPhone 7 didn't do much to   distinguish itself from older models, either. It, too, had a new   color option -- jet black -- and the larger iPhone 7 Plus model   has a dual-lens camera, but otherwise it looks quite similar to   the two-year-old iPhone 6 design.But Apple is likely to introduce a radically redesigned iPhone   later this year. Doing so will give Chinese consumers the   distinctive iPhone they want. As a result, iPhone sales are   likely to return to strong growth in China in late 2017 or 2018,   depending on availability.Sluggish iPhone sales in China aren't an indication that Apple   is in trouble. The extreme preference for distinctive new models   virtually ensures a ""two steps forward and one step back"" growth   pattern in China. Apple's next leap forward could be less than a   year away.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Intel Corporation Expects to Grow Client Computing Group Profit Margin;2/12/2017;"A little while back, microprocessor giantIntel(NASDAQ: INTC) merged its PC client group business with its   mobile group to form its client computing group. CCG is Intel's   largest business by revenue, generating nearly $33 billion in   sales during 2016.Most of that revenue comes from sales of processors and   related components into personal-computer systems, although the   company has seen reasonable success from the sale of chips that   power cable gateways and, more recently, cellular modem chips   intoApple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) iPhone.Navin Shenoy, general manager of the company's client     computing group. Image source: Intel.makeArticleAd();At Intel's Feb. 9 analyst day, company management went over   its financial expectations for this segment for 2017 -- and   beyond. Let's take a closer look.Next year's expectationsIntel says it expects CCG revenue during 2017 to drop by a   mid-single-digit percentage, which I take to mean between 5% and   7%. It's worth noting that the chipmaker had originally expected   flat-to-low single-digit revenue growth for this segment in 2016   when it provided a preliminary forecast at the end of 2015, and   then it revised its guidance down during the year to call for a   revenue decline, but it ultimately ended up seeing CCG revenue   grow by 2% for the year.The company's revenue forecast appears to be in line with its   overall personal-computer industry unit forecast, which the   company acknowledges is lower than what some of the estimates   from third-party analysts have published.What this suggests is that Intel is not only taking what it   refers to as a ""cautious outlook"" on the total addressable market   within the personal-computer market, but that it also doesn't   expect a repeat of last year's average selling price performance   in which it saw its processor average selling prices rise,   helping to offset the industrywide unit decline.As far as CCG profitability goes, Intel says it aims to see   CCG operating margin outperform CCG revenue growth. Or, put   another way, it expects operating-margin growth.How Intel will grow CCG operating margin longer     termIn a previous column, I went over why Intel expects its profit   margins in its fast-growing data-center group (DCG) todeflate in the coming years.Two of the drivers expected to hurt DCG's operating margin   going forward -- namely adopting newer, more expensive   manufacturing technologies before CCG does and taking on a larger   part of the company's shared operating expenses -- should serve   as tailwinds to CCG operating margin going forward.First, if Intel is allocating more of its shared operating   expenses to DCG and away from CCG, then this should have the   effect of lowering CCG's operating expenses. Lower operating   expenses, all else being equal, means that more of each dollar of   revenue gets turned into operating profit -- in other words,   higher operating margin.Next, if Intel's personal-computer processors will adopt new   manufacturing technologies only after DCG has had the opportunity   to break them in, then CCG should get the benefit of higher   manufacturing yields for newer products. Higher yields mean a   lower effective cost per chip, which for a given selling price   means higher gross profit margin. Higher gross profit margin,   assuming fixed operating expenses, means higher operating   margin.CCG is a cash machine, not a growth engineIt's clear that Intel is now running its personal-computer   chip business for maximum profitability, not for growth.Now, this doesn't mean the chipmaker can just halt all   investments in future products or even get complacent -- Intel   can't maintain its profit engine here if it builds bad products   or even builds good products but markets them ineffectively.But what it does mean is that CCG is going to have to be more   careful with each of its research and development dollars, and   it's probably only going to adopt new manufacturing technologies   for very high-volume products once the costs of those new   technologies has come down considerably.CCG is still going to be extremely important for Intel over   the long term, but that importance will -- if Intel is successful   -- continue to diminish in the years ahead.10 stocks we like better than IntelWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

3 Warren Buffett Stocks to Buy in February;2/12/2017;"Warren Buffett will likely go down in history as the greatest   investor of all time. Starting with a relatively small sum while   working out of his Nebraska home in the 1960s, his personal   fortune is now estimated at $73 billion. If you're trying to get   ahead in the stock market, there's nothing wrong with trying to   mimic Buffett's blueprint for success: Invest in wide-moat   companies that have an easy-to-understand business, and throw off   tons of free cash flow.Buffett no longer makes all of the investment decisions atBerkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.B)  -- he has turned some of those duties over to   his younger deputies. But if we look at what Berkshire owns, we   can choose from the list to see which are good buys this   February. Below, I'll share three that stick out.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();Buffett can't ignore the cash this company is throwing     offIt's highly likely that Buffett wasn't behind Berkshire's   investment inApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) , but he's nonetheless probably very pleased with   it. The Cupertino giant announced earnings last month that   highlighted just how strong the company has become.Fellow Fools have alreadycoveredwhat a big hit the iPhone 7 Plus was, but since this is about   Buffett, let's cover the factors that he would likely focus   on.For starters, the company now has almost a quarter-trilliondollars on its balance sheet. That's mind-boggling. But it   doesn't end there: The company has spit out $53 billion in   free cash flow over the past year alone, and it has only needed   to use 23% of that to pay its dividend. Currently yielding 1.8%   today, there's clearly lots of room for that to grow.But perhaps most importantly, the stock is still much cheaper   than the market. It trades for 16 times trailing earnings and   just 13 times free cash flow.This big dividend is looking pretty good right     nowInvestors are nervous that global car buying has hit a peak.   The cycle is turning, they believe, and we're about to see a   contraction in car sales both domestically and abroad. That helps   explain whyGeneral Motors(NYSE: GM) is so cheap right now. But Buffett likely appreciates   just how high the barriers to entry are in the auto industry, as   this makes the moat surrounding the company formidable.The company came out with earnings this month thatconfirmedsome suspicions: Sales climbed just 1.2% during 2016, and the   company was unable to turn a profit in either Europe or South   America.Image source: GMC.But this company is much more disciplined than its defunct   predecessor: Cost controls are much tighter -- with the company   choosing to slow down production in the face of waning demand.   That discipline means the company should be able to weather any   downturn and emerge much stronger.Currently, GM trades for a measly six times earnings and   seven times free cash flow. At the same time, the company brought   in $7 billion in free cash flow over the past year and used just   one-third of that cash on its dividend. With that dividend   currently yielding 4.2%, the reinvestments that will accumulate   over time will add significantly to Buffett's -- and your --   returns.We've only scratched the surface of non-cash     paymentsFinally, we haveVisa(NYSE: V) , part of the global duopoly of non-cash payments. Like   the others, the behemoth came out with earnings recently that   demonstrated just how strong the company's moat really is. As   more vendors accept Visa worldwide, shoppers are incentivized to   use the card. And as more shoppers use the card, vendors are   incentivized to accept it. It's a virtuous cycle thathelpedrevenue grow by 25% last quarter -- though acquisition of the   company's Europe operations helped there, too.The business is also very capital-light: Net profit margins   can come in as high as 40%, and that produces a lot of cash. Visa   delivered $5.5 billion in free cash flow over the past year,   while using only one-third of it to pay out dividends.Image source: Getty Images.Speaking of the dividend, while today's current yield of 0.8%   might not look impressive, it masks management's commitment to   consistently growing the payout. Over the past five years, the   company has grown its payout by over 11%per year. If you're a long-term, buy-to-hold investor, you understand how   those increases can compound over time to produce impressive   gains.If you're new to investing and looking for a place to start,   any one of these three stocks -- owned by Warren Buffett himself   -- would be a great starting place for building your own   portfolio.10 stocks we like better than VisaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

3 High-Yield Dividend Stocks You Definitely Want to Consider;2/11/2017;"Many high-yielddividend   stocksare now trading at a premium to the market and their industry   peers, due to the multi-year bull market and low interest rates   inflating demand for income stocks. But with interest rates set   to rise this year, investors should be wary of dividend stocks   that have historically low yields and historically high   valuations.It might seem tough to find undervalued stocks with high   yields in this frothy market. So in this article, I'll highlight   three stocks that still trade at discounts to their industry   peers while offering yields higher than 3% --Qualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM) ,Verizon(NYSE: VZ) , andChina Mobile(NYSE: CHL) .Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();QualcommShares of Qualcomm, the biggest mobile chipmaker in the world,   have fallen nearly 20% since the beginning of 2017 due to an FTC   lawsuit regarding the company's licensing practices,several related lawsuitsfrom longtime customerApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) , and mixed first quarter earnings.The main bear case against Qualcomm is that its core business   model -- which uses a high-margin portfolio of patents to support   its lower-margin chip business -- could be crippled if it's   forced to lower its licensing fees, which many OEMs and   regulators claim are too high. Qualcomm's chip business would   continue losing market share to cheaper chipmakers likeMediaTekand first-party chipmakers like Apple andHuawei. To top it off, the probes and lawsuits could derail its   proposed takeover ofNXP Semiconductors(NASDAQ: NXPI) , which would make it the largest automotive   chipmaker in the world.Meanwhile, the bulls believe that a Republican-led FTC will   drop the case, Qualcomm will eventually reach a settlement with   Apple, and the NXP deal can still clear its regulatory   hurdles.Regardless of the outcome, the steep sell-off has made   Qualcomm shares fundamentally cheap at 14 times earnings -- which   is much lower than its industry average of 22. Qualcomm has hiked   its dividend annually for 14 straight years, and currently pays a   forward yield of 4% -- which is comfortably supported by its   payout ratio of 63%.VerizonShares of Verizon have slipped 10% since the beginning of the   year, due to a mixed first quarter earnings report, a (recently   dropped) FCC probe of its zero-rating strategies, and   uncertainties regarding its planned acquisition of Yahoo's   internet business and rumored interest in Charter Communications.   All those question marks made Verizon look riskier than its   primary rivalAT&T(NYSE: T) , which dipped just 3% this year.But that fear also made Verizon a value play at 14 times   earnings, which compares favorably to AT&T's P/E of 17 and   the industry average of 25 for domestic telcos. The company has   also raised its dividend annually for a decade, and currently   pays a forward yield of 4.8% -- which matches AT&T's yield.   Verizon's payout ratio of 66% also gives it plenty of room for   dividend hikes in the future.Regardless of questions surrounding Verizon's near-term moves,   the telco remains the  largest wireless carrier in the U.S.,   and won't likely lose that title anytime soon. Analysts expect   Verizon's revenue and earnings growth to remain nearly flat this   year, but the company's low valuation, high yield, wide moat, and   expanding digital ecosystem still make it an ideal income play   for conservative investors.China MobileInvestors looking for an overseas domestic telco might   consider buying China Mobile, thebiggest wireless carrierin China (and the whole world). The carrier had 849 million   customers at  the end of 2016, and a large number of its 2G   and 3G users upgraded to higher revenue 4G plans throughout the   year. It also has a small but growing wireline business with 79   million customers, which could eventually enable it to launch   more comprehensive digital bundles like AT&T and Verizon.China Mobile is one of three state-owned telcos in China. The   Chinese government sometimes rotates its management with that of   its two peers --China TelecomandChina Unicom-- to ensure healthy competition between the three players. This   prevents China Mobile from ever becoming a monopoly, but it gives   it a comfortable safety net which limits its downside during   market declines.China Mobile has a trailing yield of 3.1%, which is supported   by a payout ratio of 42%. Its forward yield is uncertain, since   it adjusts the payment every year based on its earnings, but its   yield has stayed between 3% to 5% over the past five years. Its   semi-annual yield might not appeal to income investors looking   for quarterly payments, but China Mobile's trailing P/E of 15   makes it a solid value play compared to other foreign telcos,   which have an industry average of 18.The key takeawayQualcomm, Verizon, and China Mobile all have wide moats, low   valuations, and high dividends. Their near-term growth might seem   glacial, but I believe that they all have less downside potential   than other income plays, which are trading at premiums to the   market -- which makes them solid long-term plays at current   prices.10 stocks we like better than Verizon     CommunicationsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Apple, Inc. CEO Tim Cook Talks Up Augmented Reality's Potential (Again);2/10/2017;"Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) has emerged as the next champion of augmented   reality (AR). Despite the company's penchant for secrecy, it's   become increasingly clear that Apple has something in the   pipeline given that CEO Tim Cook keeps talking about AR's   transformative potential. This is that whole ""ship leaking from   the top"" bit that Steve Jobs always referred to.Every few months, Cook weighs in on the debate, either when   asked on an earnings conference call or during a media interview.   While Cook has never been a product visionary type, even by his   own admission, his rationale for why AR has more potential than   virtual reality (VR) makes an awful lot of sense, given Apple's   never-ending pursuit of technologies that have mainstream   appeal.Tim Cook holding the billionth iPhone. Image source:     Apple.makeArticleAd();The most recent interview is withThe Independent, which was published earlier today. Among other topics, Cook   discussed why AR is the way to go.""AR allows individuals to be present in the world""Perhaps the most off-putting aspect of VR for the average   consumer is the fact that users must don a headset to fully   immerse themselves into a virtual world. Even before discussing   the technical requirements or costs associated with a VR headset,   it's fundamentally isolating. In contrast, AR sits on top of the   real world as an overlay without the isolation.I'm excited about Augmented Reality because unlike Virtual     Reality which closes the world out, AR allows individuals to be     present in the world but hopefully allows an improvement on     what's happening presently. Most people don't want to lock     themselves out from the world for a long period of time and     today you can't do that because you get sick from it. With AR     you can, not be engrossed in something, but have it be a part     of your world, of your conversation. That has resonance.Cook continued that he sees the opportunity in AR as analogous   to the smartphone, believing that it can be for ""everyone."" AR   still isn't there quite yet, and needs to improve until its ""good   enough for the mainstream,"" according to the chief executive.How and when?Cook's comments are but the latest in the ongoing debate over   AR's future. In 2016, Cook discussed AR three consecutive months   in a row:The Washington Postin August,ABC Newsin September, andBuzzFeed Newsin October. It's obviously been on his mind quite a bit.At this point, the two most important questions are how Apple   will implement it -- a separate AR headset or integrated into the   iPhone camera system, or both -- and when Apple will officially   release its AR offering. If Apple goes the route of first   integrating AR into the iPhone, which would largely be   software-based, it could reduce the likelihood of leaks. In   contrast, if Apple wants to jump straight to an AR headset, its   supply chain will inevitably leak as prototypes are manufactured   and there will be more physical evidence of its aspirations.Hopefully sooner rather than later, Apple will unveil its next   ""big idea.""10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

It Can Get Worse for Qualcomm: Legal Blitz Threatens NXP Semiconductor Acquisition;2/10/2017;"It's been a rough start to the year for semiconductor giantQualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM) . After putting what many hoped were the worst of   its legal troubles behind it, Qualcomm's shares have plummeted so   far this year, as several new legal entanglements place continued   pressure on the company's patent licensing segment.These legal troubles could negatively affect the chipmaker in   a number of ways. Particularly worrisome, though, is that at   least one analyst has expressed concerns that its courtroom   battles could hamper Qualcomm's pending acquisition ofNXP Semiconductor(NASDAQ: NXPI) .makeArticleAd();QCOMdata byYChartsInside Qualcomm's legal troublesHaving unfolded in several stages around the world, Qualcomm's   five-year legal ordeal can be broken down into five major points.   Each suit has focused on the company's Qualcomm technology   licensing (QTL) segment, which produces roughly two-thirds of the   chipmaker's annual pre-tax profits.In 2013, the Chinese government launched an antitrust   investigation into Qualcomm's patent licensing   practices, which led Qualcomm to pay a $975 million fine to   Chinese regulators early last year. As part of its settlement,   Qualcomm agreed to lower the per-device royalty rates it charges   Chinese mobile-device OEMs. Collecting royalty payments for its   standard-essential 3G and 4G patents, which typically range from   3.25% to 5% of a mobile device's wholesale price before potential   rebate savings, has been a headache for Qualcomm in China. Many   Chinese OEMs either simply didn't pay Qualcomm or allegedly   underreported their royalty payments to the company, so many had   hoped that resolving its Chinese legal issues would represent the   conclusion of Qualcomm's legal woes. As it turns out, those   problems were just the beginning.In late 2015, the EU initiated a similar antitrust   investigation into potential anti-competitive practices by   Qualcomm. The European Commission, the EU's regulatory watchdog,   has yet to reach a verdict against Qualcomm. Many expect the EU   to render its findings, including potential fines, at some point   this year.Then late last year, South Korean regulators fined Qualcomm   $854 million on similar antitrust grounds. Qualcomm is currently   appealing this decision.Finally, Qualcomm was hit with two more blockbuster lawsuits   in late January. Thefirst suitcame from the Federal Trade Commission, claiming that   Qualcomm used its competitive position to gain unfair advantages   in the baseband chip market. Three days later,Apple, one of Qualcomm's largest customers, filed a $1 billion lawsuit   against Qualcomm, alleging that the chipmaker engaged in a number   of anticompetitive tactics. The charges make for someugly reading.Qualcomm is fighting each of its suits and has responded with   some compelling arguments. It doesn't make sense to   speculate about possible verdicts at this point, though some   analysts say the company's mounting legal woes could delay or   even jeopardize its pending NXP Semiconductor acquisition, an   outcome that would damage Qualcomm's long-term growth   trajectory.Image source: QualcommWill the lawsuits affect the NXP buyout?Few analysts seem to believe that Qualcomm's patent licensing   lawsuits alone could compel regulators to block the NXP   acquisition. The important issue here is that Qualcomm's current   products don't compete in the same areas of the semiconductor   market as NXP.However, it appears Qualcomm's growing number of legal   entanglements could slow the merger approval process, especially   in markets such as the EU, where Qualcomm is currently battling   antitrust charges. In fact, one sell-side analyst recently   downgraded Qualcomm shares on the assumption that the NXP deal   will indeed now take longer than expected to close, in which case   NXP's growth will take longer to have a positive impact on   Qualcomm's financial performance.Equally important, extending the time for the deal to close   also increases the odds that an unforeseen event could affect the   acquisition. What if Apple's suit fundamentally alters QTL's   licensing practices? Could that affect Qualcomm's ability to   finance the $39 billion deal? Perhaps. Could Apple's lawsuit   embolden other major customers -- say,Samsung-- to file a similar complaint? If so, what would that   mean? What if another country files yet another antitrust charge   against it?The point is that even a delay leaves the door open for some   other outside factor to come along and derail Qualcomm's critical   NXP purchase. Again, such a scenario appears unlikely. However,   given NXP's place as Qualcomm's entry point to the Internet of   Things market, any potential overhang that could threaten the   deal becomes a must-watch item for its investors.10 stocks we like better than QualcommWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Why Gross Margin Was the Star of Apple's Latest Guidance;2/10/2017;"Perhaps the most impressive aspect ofApple's(NASDAQ: AAPL)  guidance for the coming quarter was gross   margin, which may increase sequentially despite the loss of   operating leverage. In this segment fromIndustry Focus: Tech, Motley Fool analyst Dylan Lewis and senior technology   specialist Evan Niu discuss the iPhone maker's outlook for the   current period.A full transcript follows the video.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run     for over a decade,Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has tripled the market.*makeArticleAd();David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy right now... and Apple wasn't one of them!     That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better     buys.Click hereto learn about these picks!*Stock Advisor returns as of February 6, 2017This podcast was recorded on Feb. 3, 2017.Dylan Lewis:One of the things that I was happiest about, and I   think maybe this is one of the things that also pushed the   stock up as much as it did after the report,   was, looking forward, management guided that revenue should   come in somewhere between $51.5 billion and $53.5   billion for the next quarter. And this would be a 1.7% to   5.7% increase over where they were a year ago. I think the   reason you have to be really psyched about this as an investor   is, they're showing growth year over year in a quarter that isn't   fiscal Q1, where they are typically doing blockbuster   sales because of the holidays. So, it seems like we are not   only back to growth this quarter, but going to at least   continue moderate growth for the next couple quarters, if   all things hold.Evan Niu:Yeah. And another thing that's pretty   impressive about the guidance for this coming quarter, the   current quarter, is they're also leaving some room for some   gross margin upside, in terms of the guidance. The last   quarter, there was 38.5 [percent], and their current guidance is   38-39 [percent]. What's most impressive about that   is, most of the time, when you're coming off the big   fourth-quarter holiday season, you lose some operating   leverage, so you're margins usually come down slightly because of   the seasonality. For revenue to be coming down from seasonal   factors to this 51.5-53.5 level and still being able to   potentially put up a sequential increase in gross margin,   that's pretty strong. I think the biggest factor that's   contributing to volatility is all the currency stuff.   But, if they could increase gross margin on a sequential   basis after losing leverage, it's pretty good. That's   impressive.Lewis:Yeah. Strong business, firing on all cylinders. Nice   to see them back in a growth phase. Anything else that really   came out to you in the report, Evan?Niu:No. It was just really broad-based. They just hit these   numbers, small little records, but all across the business.   As an investor myself, it's pretty encouraging. There is   this perception that Apple is at the end of the road,   they're running out of ideas, they're peaking. And they're   just like, ""Hey, no, we can still squeeze out these gains if   we really push and hit on all these sides of the business.""Lewis:And that's working with a top-of-the-line   smartphone that really isn't all that different than   the previous versions. I mean, this wasn't a crazy   update to form factor, aside from, maybe, getting rid of the   headphone jack and updating the camera. The phone still resembles   what people expect of the iPhone. So, you think about what   that might mean, were they to make some really serious   updates in functionality, or do something radical   with future versions of the phone. I think you have to   like what that would do for the business.Niu:Yeah. I thought it was the least impressive update in   years. But, here we go.

It was the age of""57 channels and nothing on""with ESPN, the USA Network, CNN, the Weather Channel and the Food Network all having their heyday.Over time, the broadcasters bought out most of the new operators, sometimes after being bought themselves.CBS Corporation(NYSE:CBS) now owns Showtime and the Smithsonian Network.Comcast Corporation(NASDAQ:CMCSA), the parent of NBC, owns all or part of a dozen networks, including CNBC, Syfy and USA.Walt Disney Co(NYSE:DIS), the parent of ABC, owns ESPN, the biggest franchise of all, and the Disney networks. And Fox, which grew up in this era, has clones for nearly all of them.But in the 2010s, a new force has arisen to challenge the network owners, a force they will find difficult to compete with and almost impossible to buy.That force is streaming services, which deliver their shows to your TV, over the internet through plug-in dongles rather than set-top boxes - unless you prefer viewing on a PC, tablet or phone. These offer all the entertainment a TV zombie might ever need, and the services can cost less than $10 per month, much less than a cable service. They don't have schedules, so you watch what you want to watch, when you want to watch it.Streaming through the internet is the future of TV, and we are just at its dawn. It's still unclear how we will discover shows, how we will interface with what we want to watch or how much we'll eventually pay for the privilege of watching. But cable, at least as we knew it, is drifting away, as broadcast television previously drifted away. It will continue to exist, as broadcasting does, just in a smaller, truncated form.What is the future of live events in the new world? Is TV even going to remain a one-way, passive medium? We don't know.In addition to being better, and cheaper, for viewers, the new TV environment right now looks great for entertainers and show producers, who suddenly have a host of new options on where and how to sell their wares, which they're using to gain new creative freedom if not new wealth.But the new media landscape is a lot less stable than the old one and, given the wealth of choices available, it may prove much less lucrative for stars, writers and producers.Just a few years into the new era, moreover, it's apparent that the new streaming companies are big enough to regard the cable networks' owners as minnows. This is not a problem the networks can buy their way out of, as they bought out of cable.7 High-Risk, High-Reward Stocks to Buy NowYour mission, as an investor, is to examine the new TV stocks and decide whether to invest your money in them. And along the way, you will be buying a lot more than TV.Stocks to Buy for the Future of TV: Netflix (NFLX)Source:Via NetflixThe business model of the new TV era was created byNetflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX).A decade ago, Netflix was a relatively small but interesting company that mailed DVDs. You paid a monthly fee to hold a few, then got more when you sent them back. It was a relatively simple business based on physical media, but it had potential.By simply moving that business model online,using cloud services and open-source technology, Netflix now delivers unlimited amounts of content to viewers as a stream, rather than on a disk.Cofounder Reed Hastings has transformed TV as no one has since Ted Turner. If you bought Netflix when it went public in 2002, your $1 investment is now worth $137.Hasting's second big innovation, which came on the heels of the streaming business model, was tostart funding his own programmingrather than just reselling existing movies and TV shows. His string of hits began withHouse of Cards, based on a British mini-series, which by itself made his monthly $8 per month subscription fee seem a bargain.Netflix offers its shareholders low profit margins, but great growth. Between 2013 and 2016, revenue doubled, from $4.37 billion to $8.83 billion, and profits nearly followed, from 26 cents per share to 43 cents. Along the way, the company has increased its debt dramatically - it now represents about one-fourth of assets - to pay for its delivery infrastructure and to obtain new programming assets, which it is assumed will retain their value over time. (Your grandkids will watchHouse of Cardsthe way your kids now watchM*A*S*H.)With a market cap of $62 billion, Netflix could now buy other TV stocks, like CBS. Its value exceeds that of Fox. ABC and NBC are protected from a Netflix acquisition by deep-pocketed parents, Disney and Comcast. HBO, a subscription service based on cable, will be protected in the same way once parentTime Warner Inc(NYSE:TWX) is bought byAT&T Inc.(NYSE:T).NFLX retains its value as an investment because ofits international operations, which by the fourth quarter of 2016 represented around 40% of the total and continue to grow. In the last three months of 2016 alone the company added 7.05 million new members, after forecasting it would add just 5.2 million. Netflix' growth is accelerating, and its ability to buy must-see programming is growing with it.The problem for Netflix is that the cloud providers on which its success rests have seen what it has done. They're on to the trick. A network today isn't necessarily just a provider of content, but the scaled infrastructure necessary to provide that content. The owners of cloud networks and vast internet networks are copying what Netflix does.These challengers have more zeroes in their asset bases than those NFLX has faced before. Once more, Reed Hastings is a minnow in a sea of sharks.Everything about the industry has changed, but whether Netflix can ride the changes, or whether it will eventually be bought out as Turner was, remains up for debate.Stocks to Buy for the Future of TV: Amazon (AMZN)Source: ShutterstockThereisa price cheaper than Netflix' $8 per month for all-you-can-eat entertainment - the nothing extra I payAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) to access its video as a Prime member.It is true that you can buy Amazon Prime Video, separately,for $8.99 per month. But that's silly since the regular price for Prime, which includes free two-day shipping on most Amazon items, is $99 per year (about $8.25 per month).Lately, Amazon has also been outperforming Netflix on the awards front. In addition to11 Golden Globe nominations this year alone, there are six Oscar nominations forManchester by the Sea(Amazonpaid $10 million for the distribution rightsa year ago).Frankly there is so much free stuff on Amazon (which I can watch on a big screen with my Fire Stick, a wireless dongle that fits on the side of the TV, connects to the internet via WiFi, and supports a host of other services including Netflix) that I don't need anything else. Were it not for live sports, I would kill my cable in a heartbeat, and as my favorite sports signstreaming contracts, that motivation is disappearing as well.And it's not just TV either. I'm fortunate enough to have a wife who hates TV. She reads instead. Amazon's Kindle Unlimited, for another $99 per year, became fantastic over the last year as more authors have signed up and Amazon's algorithms have gotten better at anticipating what people might want to borrow next from its vast library.My son doesn't watch TV either. He's a gamer, and has been for years. He is constantly talking aboutTwitch, which offers live streams of people playing video games. I don't get it, but Amazon does. They paid $970 million for Twitchlast March, making them partners with characters such as Bunnyfufu, who stream their gamingon Twitch.Like most people, I watch very few cable channels. Cancel cable and there is $100-150 per month I can pay for whatever programming I want. There are only so many hours in a day - who needs hundreds of channels with nothing on when a streaming service (or maybe two) can meet my needs?If I sound like an Amazon fanboy, it's because I am. As previously noted, my TV has an Amazon Fire Stick plugged into it, and I use a Fire tablet for reading. I also started accumulating Amazon shares in 2014, at an average price of $330. They're now worth about $800, and they're a bargain at that price.For the fourth quarter of 2016 Amazon earned $749 million, $1.54 per share, on revenues of$43.741 billion. It is making the turn from a company investing in front of growth to one that starts earning profits regularly. Its cloud operation, Amazon Web Services, now brings one-quarter of its $3.5 billion in quarterly revenue to the bottom line - and one of its customers is Netflix.10 Super-Safe Dividend Growth Stocks to Buy TodayImagine. Amazon creates infrastructure that lets other companies make money, then competes with its customers to make even more money with the same infrastructure. I recently dumped shares before earnings, at $832 per share, because they had become such a huge portion of my retirement account.I may have to buy them back.Stocks to Buy for the Future of TV: Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL)Source: ShutterstockNetflix may have created the new business model and Amazon may have perfected it, but the technology began atAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG), with Google and YouTube.One of YouTube's co-founders says the idea started afterthe Janet Jackson ""wardobe malfunction""at the 2004 Super Bowl. They just couldn't find any video of it, and so asked others to upload it so they could see it. The service was an immediate sensation, and Google's purchase of the site for $1.65 billion was just the beginning.The business model was simple. People upload videos, people watch videos. Google places ads in front of the videos, and shares some of the revenue with those who uploaded the videos. Like Google itself, it is a free service, although it now has a paid version called YouTube Red.YouTubedid not make a profit for its parentuntil after Amazon and Netflix got going. It is now estimated to be bringing in$10 billion per year, growing at 40% per year, with 80% of views outside the U.S. By 2020 that will mean$27 billionin revenue per year. Its audience is tilted toward young people, aged 18-34, the kind advertisers most covet, and a growing percentage access it via phones or tablets.An analysis from STL Partners indicates YouTube's profit contribution is mainly indirect. Its traffic helps Google get the best prices for internet bandwidth. Its meta data is contributed to other Google services. It gives Google a place at the tablewhenever video copyright issuesare discussed.Veteran TV producer Susanne Daniels joined Google in 2015, and is charged withgrowing the YouTube Red service. She is not onlybuying TV showsand makinga splash at movie festivalsbut aiming to take veteran TV hosts likeConan O'Brien online. (Chelsea Handler has already moved to Netflix.) Daniels is helped by continuing sales ofChromecast, a TV streaming device which competes with the Apple Fire StickYouTube has created its own stars, most of whom are unknown to their parents' generation. The most popular YouTube celebrity, PewDiePie, drew $15 million in income last year and hadalmost 50 million viewers.By taking advantage of Google's low-cost infrastructure, YouTube has carved out a unique niche for itself in the new TV universe, one that is subsidizing its entrance into more ""traditional"" areas like YouTube Red subscriptions.Thanks to Amazon's purchase of Twitch, TV stocks Google and Amazon are now on a collision course in the world of streaming video. Customers of both will be the big winners, but stockholders should do well, too.Stocks to Buy for the Future of TV: Apple (AAPL)Source:via AppleApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) was a latecomer to TV streaming in the cloud.Apple began ramping up spending for its own cloud only a few years ago,investing $15 billion in 2016 aloneto build a global network of cloud data centers and, potentially, a place for itself in the new industry.The money was spent mainly to serve existing paid Apple services, like the sale apps, iCloud storage and iTunes, which are nowbigger profit drivers than the Macintosh or iPad. CEO Tim Cook said in his most recent earnings call that Apple Services brought in$7.17 billionin the December quarter alone, which he expects will double by 2020.Apple's streaming business is distinguished from that of Google because it consists of paid subscribers, and distinguished from Amazon and Netflix by being primarily fee-for-service rather than subscription revenue.While iPhone sales are stagnating, Apple has found a new growth engine in services, and built a platform to challenge the other streaming players. Apple Music now has about21%of the music streaming market,half that of rivalSpotify, but Spotify is not profitable and struggling to justify a $8 billion valuation, which at One Infinite Loop is considered seat cushion money.Apple's push into TV streaming will be through a new app called, simply,TV, which aims to solve one of the most vexing problems for a streaming user - deciding what to watch next. The Apple TV streaming service itself has yet to launch, butrumors about it abound. Apple wants to get the same 30% revenue cut on TV streaming it gets on apps, producing a service that will cost $20-30 per month.The most persistent rumors about Apple's intent regarding streaming involveHBO Now, a Time Warner service that costs $15 per month, and which was Apple exclusive for a few months in 2015. Apple has the financial wherewithal to buy HBO as part of Time Warner's merger with AT&T, or to buy a broadcasting company like CBS for cash. Apple TV hardware isused by an estimated 11.9%of TV streaming customers.Thanks to its existing service businesses, global reach and over $200 billion in cash, Apple has the freedom to be patient and negotiate with rights holders before launching a TV streaming service. But it is far more concerned with maintaining its high margins than with driving traffic, which hurts it in competition with services whose prices start at virtually free, like Google's YouTube and Amazon Prime.It is hard for me to see how Apple can win in streaming when it's unwilling to bend on margins to win market share, and willing to dither aimlessly with existing TV rights holders while rivals are creating their own shows and even new types of experiences.7 Tech Stocks That Are Bucking the DowntrendBut that's just my opinion. I bought Apple shares before its 7:1 split in 2014, sold about half, but retain them in my retirement account. It's going to be a nice retirement.Stocks to Buy for the Future of TV: AT&T (T)Source:Mike Mozart via FlickrI got my first glimpse of the future several years ago, when rights to English Premier League games came up for bids.The winners weren't the traditional networks, public or private. They wereSky TV, a direct broadcast satellite company, andBritish Telecom, the state phone company.This was years before AT&T said it would buy Time Warnerfor a reported $85.4 billion. It was even years before AT&T agreed to spend$48.5 billion forDirecTV, the direct broadcast satellite business.The two deals will combine to transform AT&T from a phone company into a streaming player. It will be able to bundle wireless, satellite and internet subscriptions, and let its customers stream shows from DirecTV to their mobile deviceswithout cost.Its new streaming service, DirecTV Now, carried an introductory price of $35 per month for 60 channels and attractedover 200,000 customers during the fourth quarterwhich helped offset a loss of customers from its more traditional cable service, U-Verse. It competes ina cord-cutting nichealongsideSling TV, owned by DirecTV rivalDISH Network Corp(NASDAQ:DISH), and Playstation Vue, owned bySony Corp (ADR)(NYSE:SNE)For the fourth quarter, AT&T reported net income of $2.44 billion, 39 cents per share, on revenue of $41.84 billion. While this didn't clear the company's 49-cent-per-share dividend payment during the quarter, for the year the company did earn $2.10 per share, beating the $1.93 annual dividend. It's the dividend, a 4.7% yield to today's stock buyer, that you're buying when you buy AT&T stock. The shares themselves are worth little more than they were in 2007.I switched from Comcast to AT&T for my own TV and internet service last year, combining it with my existing mobile phone subscription. I now pay the company about $400 per month for various services. That's a lot of cash flow. I should probably buy the stock.AT&T is the most traditional of the new streaming players. It earns a place in this gallery for its sheer size, with annual revenue of $164 billion, and its control of key internet infrastructure in the core of the network and at the edge.AT&T has moved into streaming for defensive reasons. Internet advocates have criticized it for DirecTV Now, which gives its own customers free bits that others are charged for, ignoring the concept of network neutrality, but the Donald Trump Administration isgiving it a free pass on that.When the acquisition of Time Warner is finalized - and that looks like a better bet with Trump in charge - AT&T will own a big hunk of the traditional cable universe, including HBO, CNN and Cartoon Network.Time Warner agreed to be bought, in part, because it needs cash to compete for programming against deep-pocketed rivals like Netflix, Amazon, Google and possibly Apple. AT&T bought Time Warner because the vertical integration - owning the programming as well as the network so you write rights checks to yourself - should allow it to maintain that dividend.Comcast made the marriage of network infrastructure and content work with NBC Universal, mainly by keeping its hands off its creative people. It is still unclear to me whether AT&T will be willing to do the same, or whether it will focus on milking a dying industry for profits, which has been its way of doing business since I began covering them over three decades ago.That's the only thing keeping me from buying the shares. That and the lack of capital gains.Stocks to Buy for the Future of TV: Facebook (FB)Source:SilverIsdead Via FlickrFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) is the newest and, based on revenue, the second-smallest of the new streaming players, behind only Netflix.During the December quarter Facebookearned $1.41 per shareon $8.81 billion in revenue. This makes it four times bigger than Netflix by revenue. With a market cap of about $390 billion, it isthe sixth most valuable company in the country, less than five years after first going public.Facebook got into streaming withFacebook Live, a sort of YouTube for streaming, which has already made news with House Democrats streaming a sit-in when Republicans turned off their cameras and with Donald Trump announcing a Supreme Court pick on the service.Facebook Live is already getting Facebook into trouble with rights holders, like the TV network which saw sales of a recent pay-per-view fight in Australia impacted when one subscribersimply held his phone up to his TV and streamed it. There is even a name for this kind of thing -""stream ripping.""Facebook is reportedlyworking on an app for streaming, which would put it into more direct competition with Apple TV and Google's YouTube. This would be a software solution that lets it piggyback on others' hardware, like Chromecast, Amazon's Fire Stick and Apple TV. In addition to supporting its streaming, the app would also support 10-minute TV shows with commercials inserted into them,like broadcast TV in the 1940s.What makes Facebook powerful in streaming is the sheer number of people using the service - nearly 2 billion - and the amount of time they spend with it. The average global user spends 20 minutes per day on the service, andthe average American spends twice that amount of time.Analysts are divided on analogiesfor Facebook's strategy here. Is it Netflix? Is it YouTube?In fact, neither analogy is correct. Facebook mainly wants to integrate video into its existing offering. It is backing away frompaying publishers for streams, and may be backing away in the near term as people use its unmoderated do-it-yourself streaming to show themselvescommitting violent crimesandeven committing suicide.All this reminds me of something I wrote 20 years ago, about telephony. Telephony is simply an internet service. Today, video is the same, an internet service. The difference is that video is far more intimate than a phone call, easier to make money from and subject to discussion of rights, or right and wrong.12 Stocks That Will Live and Die by Donald Trump's PenIntegrating video, even streaming video, as just one part of a broader computer experience is the road not being taken by anyone but Facebook.Stocks to Buy for the Future of TV: Alibaba (BABA)Source: ShutterstockAlibaba Group Holding Ltd(NASDAQ:BABA) got into streaming in 2015 by buyingYouku Tudou, a Chinese version of YouTube,for $4 billion-plus.Alibaba was late to this business, but is working hard to make up for lost time. It launched a paid streaming service calledTmall Box Officein September, 2015. It has a TV operating systemcalled YunOS, which is getting its streaming services into homes throughout East and South Asia.In 2016, Alibaba launchedpartnerships with a host of global producers, the most important being with Steven Spielberg'sAmblin Entertainment, which is aiming to bring Chinese stories to American audiences and vice versa. Alibaba also took a stakein China'sHeHe Picturesand signed a deal withHarry Potterproducer David Heyman to produce a series of movies aroundWarriors,a children's book series about warring cats. Already in 2017 Alibaba has signed to becomea major sponsor of the Olympic Games, responsible for streaming events and back-end cloud computing.Thanks to deals like this, Alibaba's digital media revenues grew 270% year-over-year, inits most recent quarterly report.The segment produced $585 million in revenue.Despite all this, Alibaba is still a relative minnow in the streaming TV stocks waters. Its streaming revenue is just one-quarter that of Netflix. What makes it powerful, and a threat to the giants, is its strength throughout Asia, not just in China; its willingness to buy its way into businesses like movie production; and its highly profitable growth trajectory, which gives it a cash hoard worth $15 billion, which it is far more aggressive about investing than Apple.Because Alibaba enables commerce, rather than buying inventory as Amazon does, it brings over 25% of its revenue to the net income line, with operating cash flow that has grown four-fold in the last four years. It has enormous advantages in China, the world's second-largest and one of its fastest-growing markets. This has given it a springboard into other markets like India, Indonesia and Thailand, where it is also growing a range of services.It is just a matter of time before Alibaba becomes a major factor in the U.S. market, through its ownership of content and cloud operations if nothing else. Any innovation a U.S. company can come up with, moreover, can be jumped on by Alibaba in a flash, grown in China as a captive market, and then sprung on the world quickly.It may be the most important story of the next four years, but it won't be televised. It will definitely be streamed. I'm a buyer.Dana Blankenhornis a financial and technology journalist. He is the author of the sci-fi novellaInto the Cloud, available at the Amazon Kindle store.

7 Dividend Stocks for the Retirement You Deserve;2/10/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsDividend stocks are a great choice for achieving the retirement you deserve. Yet there is perhaps no concept in the cultural lexicon that has been more perverted in recent years than the concept ""deserve.""makeArticleAd();Source:Mike via Flickr (Modified)In America today, many people think they deserve a decent job, good health, safety and security … just by the accident of their existence. Children and young adults are taught they deserve a trophy for participating in sports, and that they deserve good grades in school just for showing up.Call me old school, but I think the only thing one deserves in life is what one earns. That's true of a job, healthcare, safety, recognition, grades or anything else that is a value one mustactupon to gain and/or keep. It's also true when it comes to your retirement.You see, you don'tdeservewell-funded golden years unless you take action to earn it.Fortunately, acting now to ensure a deserving retirement isn't really difficult to know how to do. It is, however, actually hard to do.Let's face it: Deferring the short-term gratification that comes from spending money on today's needs, wants and luxury indulgences requires an uncomfortable exercise in self-restraint. Yet mustering the fortitude to think long-term is usually what's required if you want that well-funded retirement you think you deserve.While I can only help you with the self-restraint aspect of this task by identifying the reality of this requirement, I can help you much more by identifying some of the best dividend stocks to buy that will help provide you the financial fertilizer by which you can grow those deserving golden years.10 Super-Safe Dividend Growth Stocks to Buy TodayHere are seven dividend stocks to buy for the retirement you deserve.Dividend Stocks to Buy for Retirement: General Motors (GM)Source: ShutterstockGM Dividend Yield:4.3%General Motors Company(NYSE:GM), or ""Government Motors,"" has finally escaped the fiscal speed bump it hit during the Great Recession. Now the company is firing in all cylinders, selling vehicles to U.S. and international consumers at a record pace.GM cleared the 10 million mark for vehicles soldfor the first time ever in 2016. That's thanks to successes in China, where the automaker sold an all-time best 3.87 million vehicles - a 7.1% improvement from the previous year.Although the short- and intermediate-term fate of GM stock will rev and stall based on monthly sales figures and quarterly reports, there is no denying that this behemoth is here to stay for the long haul. As long as the world needs transportation via cars and light trucks, GM is likely to be there to sell them. We know this because despite the government bailout in December 2008, the company is back and better than ever before.That's the power of a stalwart brand - and one that U.S. government won't let go down under any circumstances.Dividend Stocks to Buy for Retirement: Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)Source:Dawn Via FlickrJNJ Dividend Yield:2.8%When selecting dividend stocks for the retirement you deserve, concentrate on consumer non-discretionary companies making things we all can't do without.I suspect that healthcare products giantJohnson & Johnson(NYSE:JNJ) is in your medicine cabinet right now. The iconic and ultra-diversified consumer, pharmaceutical and medical device maker is famous for shampoo, skin lotion, baby oil, wound care and over-the-counter (OTC) medicines.And that's just the consumer segment.The company's medical devices are used in orthopedic surgical care, cardiovascular care, diagnostics and vision treatments. Yet it's the success of its pharmaceutical division that vaults JNJ on to our list of dividend stocks. The company's treatments for chronic and ever-growing afflictions such as rheumatoid arthritis, prostate cancer and diabetes give it the financial heft needed to be a long-term retirement hold.The Top 10 Dow Dividend Stocks for FebruaryAnd acquisitions like its$30 billion buyout of biopharma outfitActelionwill keep JNJ ahead of the game.Dividend Stocks to Buy for Retirement: Apple (AAPL)Source: Carved.comAAPL Dividend Yield:1.7%Personal technology giantApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) is a profit machine, and after years of building up billions in cash on its balance sheet, the Cupertino behemoth decided to give some of that cash back to shareholders.While AAPL's yield is on the lower end of this list of deserving dividend stocks to buy, that shouldn't dissuade you from putting it on your list.You see, part of a deserving retirement requires some of your stocks to also deliver outsize share price appreciation. In that department, AAPL tastes sweet. Over the past 10 years, the stock is up more than 1,000%. And while the odds of another 1,000% gain over the next 10 years are low, I suspect a decade from now, those who own AAPL today will be flashing triple-digit-percentage-gain smiles.Dividend Stocks to Buy for Retirement: AT&T (T)Source:Mike Mozart via FlickrT Dividend Yield:4.7%Classic widow-and-orphan stockAT&T Inc.(NYSE:T) is just one of those telecom dividend stock giants perfectly tailored for delivering that deserved retirement. The company's massive 100% fiber network delivers wireless and TV services across the country, and the revenues it generates from these services is reason alone to own the stock.Yet the company also is very inventive (it holds more than 20,000 patents), and it has demonstrated business savvy in its merger deals withDirecTV, and soon (if the government doesn't block it) withTime Warner Inc(NYSE:TWX). AT&T says it's on pace toclose the merger by year's end.10 Stocks to Buy That Already Make America GreatDividend-wise, T is in elite status, havingraised its payout for the past 33 yearswhile also offering one of the highest yields in theS&P 500.Dividend Stocks to Buy for Retirement: Disney (DIS)Source:Richard Stephenson via Flickr (Modified)DIS Dividend Yield:1.4%If you're reading this, I can make one obvious assumption about you, and that is you're sentient in the year 2017. That's enough information for me to know that you also know whatWalt Disney Co(NYSE:DIS) is, and what it does.The purveyors of iconic American characters such as Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck and Snow White know what the world wants to see, and has built a media and entertainment empire that now includes characters such as Captain America, BB-8 and Merida.The company, founded on the genius of Walt Disney the man, was set up to be a dream factory capable of igniting children's imaginations all over the world. It's safe to say that it has done just that.DIS the stock also has ignited investors' portfolios. Over the past decade, shares are up nearly 220% while also paying a solid (though admittedly not spectacular) dividend yield of 1.4%. But like AAPL, Disney is one of those dividend stocks likely to keep delivering the sort of outsize total returns that can provide you the retirement you deserve.Dividend Stocks to Buy for Retirement: Merck (MRK)Source:Ryan via Wikimedia (Modified)MRK Dividend Yield:2.9%Drug giantMerck & Co., Inc.(NYSE:MRK) is similar to JNJ in that it makes products that people can't do without. Although in Merck's case, many of its products literally keep people alive (e.g., its top-selling treatment, the diabetes pill Januvia).The company's diverse lineup of high-margin drugs will keep delivering strong revenue and strong profits for years to come. Moreover, its pipeline of new drugs also should keep its top and bottom lines healthy enough to deliver strong returns on invested capital over the long-term.Although the company has faced robust competition from branded drugs going off-patent in recent years, industry analysts tell me the company has gotten past the worst of the off-patent losses. My research also indicates recent R&D is on the upswing, which means even more high-margin drugs in the years to come.10 High-Yield Dividend Stocks That Are SOMEHOW Still BargainsThat means good fiscal therapy for that deserved retirement.Dividend Stocks to Buy for Retirement: Goldman Sachs (GS)Source:Erik DrostGS Dividend Yield:2.6%If you were asked to name the first Wall Street investment bank that comes to mind, I suspect that name would beGoldman Sachs Group Inc(NYSE:GS). The company has financed America's growth since 1869, racking up a storied history of providing the capital, as well as the financial framework, that's nurtured the rise of American capitalism.By recruiting and hiring some of the smartest, most business-savvy people on earth to carry on the company's stellar tradition, Goldman Sachs has managed to deliver big for investors even through the dark days of the Great Depression and the Great Recession. And while GS isn't the biggest yielder among financial dividend stocks, its decent 2.6% yield has helped smooth out a few rough periods.It's no coincidence that many former Goldman Sachs employees rise to positions of power in government after stints at the premier investment house. The company and its personnel have earned their immense influence world … and that influence translates directly to deserving investor bottom lines.As of this writing, Jim Woods was long AAPL and GS.The post7 Dividend Stocks for the Retirement You Deserveappeared first onInvestorPlace."

The Next iPhone Wants to Look Into Your Eyes;2/10/2017;"Expectations for the 2017 iPhone are running high, given the   fact that it will be the 10th-generation ofApple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) most important product. As always, a steady   stream of supply-chain leaks are stoking speculation as to what   features the Mac maker may or may not include. The most expensive   feature-packed model may even set customers backover $1,000. Today's rumor comes from the notoriously hit-or-missDigiTimes, which says that in addition to an OLED display and wireless   charging, the device will also include iris-scanning   technology.A boulder of saltAs always, investors should treat any and all iPhone rumors   with a healthy bit of skepticism. That's especially true since   we've heard similar reports before. Apple first started exploring   iris-scanning technology back in 2014, andDigiTimessaid in July 2016 that the iris-scanning feature wouldn't be   included until the 2018 iPhone. A month later, the same outlet   said 2017 would be the year Apple would debut the technology   after placing orders for iris-recognition chips with Taiwan-based   Xintec.Separately, there are conflicting reports that Apple may   instead prefer to use some type of facial recognition system, as   Apple has filed numerous patents around bio-recognition   methods.makeArticleAd();Biometrics are all the rage right nowIt makes sense that Apple is exploring iris-recognition   technology; what's less clear is the timing of when Apple will   pull the trigger. Iris recognition would be a strong complement   to Touch ID, adding another layer of biometric security. Iris   scanning is even more secure than fingerprint scanning since it's   harder to fake. You may remember when researchers cracked Touch   ID shortly after the feature's launch in 2013, although it still   stands that Touch ID is still vastly superior to alpha-numeric   passwords.Imagine Apple Pay using iris recognition. Image source:     Apple.Beyond logging in, it's also easy to imagine how Apple may   wish to add another layer of biometric security to Apple Pay,   making the company's mobile payment service even more secure.Everybody's doing itThis is an area rivals have already been exploring.Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) included an iris scanner and Windows Hello,   Microsoft's biometric login functionality, in 2015's Lumia 950   and 950 XL. The software giant has yet to bring iris recognition   to other Windows Hello-enabled devices, although many Windows 10   PCs can use facial recognition technology.Samsung's Galaxy Note 7 from last year also included an iris scanner,   which in addition to its propensity to spontaneously combust was   a differentiating feature from Samsung's other flagship devices   from 2016 like the Galaxy S7 or S7 Edge. While the South Korean   company's initial efforts to popularize iris-scanning technology   went down in literal flames, the forthcoming Galaxy S8 is   expected to feature an iris scanner. Samsung also launches its   Galaxy flagships in the spring, and the S8 is expected to be   unveiled in March ahead of an April launch.Apple cares little about being the first -- it just wants to   be the best. If it can implement iris scanning in a more seamless   and integrated way than rivals, it could accelerate the   popularization of biometric security better than anyone else.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

This 50% Dividend Grower Is Hiding in Plain Sight;2/10/2017;"There are two ways to get big dividends: you can buy stocks that boast highcurrentyields, or you can buy stocks that consistently grow their payouts.A well-balanced portfolio will include both types of companies, withdividend-growth stocksbeing the cornerstone of a longer-term income strategy.Still, investors sometimes get frustrated with dividend growers because to get their outsized payout growth, you often have to settle for a low current yield. And why buy a risky asset that yields 1% when you can get a long-term Treasury that pays 2%?makeArticleAd();There are two answers to this question. The first is that Treasuries aren't risk-free. If you buy a 10-year note and interest rates go up, the value of your Treasury will go down. If you need to sell early for some reason, you'll lose money.Secondly, dividend-growth stocks will increase their income over time - something Treasuries will never do. In fact, if you choose thebest dividend growth stocks, you'll see your income skyrocket in a few short years.And the best dividend growth stock is one of the world's most recognizable and popular brands:Apple (AAPL).If you read about investing in Apple, you almost always see a focus on iPhone sales, the value of future products and so on. Bears note slowing iPhone sales growth (or negative sales growth), devices that didn't quite catch on and rising competition. Bulls counter that Apple has a valuable and unique market position and innovative products that captivate consumers.Both arguments are really missing the point.The main reason to buy Apple is more boring but more important: net income, free cash flow (FCF) and dividends.Let's start with FCF, which is now $9.65 per share, meaning Apple's dividend-payout ratio is a measly 24%. But the really amazing thing is how the company's cash flow has exploded and continues to rise:FCF Boots UpYes, there's been a bit of a dip in the last year, but you can also see that FCF has already bottomed out and is now back on the rise.The next thing to consider is Apple's operating margin, which is currently 27%. This is important because it means the company is so profitable that it can continue to pay out dividends at the current payout rate. That operating margin has fallen slightly in recent years, partly as a result of changes in the smartphone market, but it's still historically high:Apple Remains a Profit MonsterNote that we've seen Apple's profit margin remain over 25% since 2009. This is great news for investors, but it also means Apple has become a very different company than it was in the 1990s and 2000s. It's no longer a burgeoning tech firm but an enterprise that reliably and consistently produces cash it can distribute to shareholders. In other words, it's a blue chip stock, not a speculative bet.Again, great news for investors - especially those looking for income. Ironically, many dividend-growth investors forget about Apple, or they may allocate a very small part of their portfolios to the company out of fear that it's risky. That's a mistake.In the last five years since Apple started paying dividends, its payout has soared 50.6%:Strong Dividend GrowthIf we compare that to some of the most popular and supposedly ""safer"" dividend payers, we see that Apple's dividend growth is a big outperformer:Apple Trounces the RestAs you can see,General Electric (GE), AT&T (T), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Chevron (CVX), Consolidated Edison (ED)andExxon Mobil (XOM)are all growing their dividends at a slower pace than Apple.The tech giant also has a lower P/E ratio than all of these names (just 15.6, which is 39% lower than the rest of the S&P 500).It's time to think different about Apple; this is a relatively safe dividend stock that is destined to be a Dividend Aristocrat. While headlines about iPhone sales may cause some volatility in the short term, the company's strong cash generation will reward you with big payouts in the long run.7 More Buys for 100%+ GainsApple isn't the only cheap dividend grower out there - there are plenty more (yes, even in a market that's trading at a nosebleed 24 times earnings!).In fact, we're cashing in on 7 other stocks hiking their payoutseven fasterthan Apple: I'm talkingreliable yearly dividend hikes of 20%+!These 7 low-key stocks are where you need to be with the Trump bump sputtering and the Fed sending mixed signals on interest rates. With each of these ""magnificent 7"" throwing off regular 20%+ payout hikes,their prices will simply be forced up 100% - and higher - in the coming months and years.The full story is in our exclusive new guide:""7 Great Dividend-Growth Stocks for a Secure Retirement,""yours FREE.Click here to get your copy and discover these stealth dividend-growth plays for yourself."

4 Technology Stocks Well Poised to Beat Earnings Estimates;2/10/2017;"The fourth-quarter earnings season has been reasonably well for 13 out of 16 Zacks categorized sectors, with overall earnings up +5.8% from the same period last year on +4.5% higher revenues. As per the latest ZacksEarnings Outlook, this growth rate is much better than +2.8% earnings growth on +2.0% revenue growth for this same group of companies in the third quarter.makeArticleAd();Notably, 319 S&P 500 members (76.3% of the index's total membership) have already reported their results. Of this, 69.6% stocks have beat earnings estimates and 54.5% have come ahead of revenue expectations. However, positive surprises are tracking below the 75.5% and 58.9% earnings and revenue beat percentages for this same group of companies in the preceding quarter, respectively.Overall, earnings are now anticipated to grow +7.3% on +3.9% higher revenues on a year-over-year basis. The anticipated figures mark a solid improvement over the third quarter earnings growth of 3.7% on the back of 2.2% higher revenues. Moreover, the earnings growth figure is the highest since the fourth quarter of 2014.Technology: A Standout Sector in Q4Technology has been one of the standout sectors in the fourth quarter. Almost 86.1% of the sector's total market capitalization has already reported. Total earnings for these companies are up +7.8% from the same period last year on +6.0% higher revenues, with 70.5% beating EPS estimates and 75% beating revenue estimates.The strong growth reflected solid performance from industry giants like Intel Corp,Microsoft(MSFT) andAlphabet(GOOGL). Contrary to the third quarter,Apple's(AAPL) big earnings beat also helped results this time.The rapid adoption of cloud was the common growth factor for these companies. Additionally, growing acceptance of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, personal assistants and Internet of Things (IoT) drove overall results.We believe the rapid adoption of cloud-based technologies will be the key catalyst going ahead. Per IDC, IT spending on cloud infrastructure - servers, enterprise storage, and Ethernet switches for the enterprise private cloud and co-location services - will increase 18.2% in 2017 to $44.2 billion. The growth rate is particularly noticeable when compared with spending on traditional IT, which is expected to decline 3.3% in 2017.How to Make the Right Pick?With the existence of a number of industry players, finding the right stocks that have the potential to beat earnings could be a daunting task. Our proprietary methodology, however, makes it fairly simple for you. You could narrow down the list of choices by looking at stocks that have the combination of a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positiveEarnings ESP.Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for determining stocks that have the best chance to surprise with their next earnings announcement. It provides the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Our research shows that for stocks with this combination, the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70%.Our ChoicesGiven below are four technology providers that have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Applied Optoelectronics Inc.(AAOI) - Sugar Land, TX-based Applied Optoelectronics designs, develops and manufactures advanced optical devices, packaged optical components, optical subsystems, laser transmitters and fiber optic transceivers.We note that the company has beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two out of preceding four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 106.74%.The company is expected to report fourth-quarter 2016 results on Feb 23.

How Apple Inc. Hopes to Grow Its Services Business to $50 Billion by 2020;2/10/2017;"Services continue to be an increasingly important segment forApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) , in part due to the recurring nature of the   revenue it produces. In this segment fromIndustry Focus: Tech, the cast discusses how Apple plans to double the size of this   business over the next four years.A full transcript follows the video.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run     for over a decade,Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has tripled the market.*makeArticleAd();David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy right now... and Apple wasn't one of them!     That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better     buys.Click hereto learn about these picks!*Stock Advisor returns as of February 6, 2017This podcast was recorded on Feb. 3, 2017.Dylan Lewis:One of the segments that is gaining more and   more attention from analysts and the market in general   is Apple's services segment. This is the iTunes Store, the   App Store, Apple Pay, Apple Music, TV App Store, etc. Services,   this time, came in at $7.2 billion, which is roughly 9% of   revenue. But, perhaps more impressively, it was up 18% year   over year. It seems like the company and the Street are both   giving this a little bit more emphasis as time goes on.Evan Niu:Yeah. And that was a quarterly record, one of   those records they set this quarter. If you look at it   now on a trailing 12-month basis, services has now crossed   $25 billion, in terms of the size of the business. So this   is a huge business already. Here's the crazy thing:   They're very ambitiously saying they're hoping to double the   services business within four years. That's saying,   ""We think we can make this a $50 billion business by   2020."" Which is pretty ambitious. As far as how they'll get   there, they highlighted a couple things. First of all, now,   there are 150 million paid subscriptions that are   being automatically billed, recurring subscriptions.   That includes Apple's services as well as third-party services.   But that's the total number that is being billed through   iTunes and the App Store right now. That's a pretty big number.   They do expect that to keep growing. That's a pretty big base of   regular subscriptions of various types of services that they   sell. Transaction volumes are going up, the installed base   is growing. There's really all these different aspects of it.   They even mentioned -- this is kind of surprising -- the   iCloud storage business is growing quite a bit. I would   never have thought it would be a growth driver.   But, basically, all these different aspects are really   putting up good growth, and combined, they're really bullish   about this going forward. It's a pretty ambitious goal there.Lewis:Yeah. Looking at the inputs of what makes up that   services revenue, there's momentum on both sides. Not only   is the installed base is getting larger -- so,   the number of people that are actually somehow   transacting with the services segment -- they indicated   in the call that that's increasing in the strong double   digits. Also, the ARPU (average revenue per user) for each paying   customer is increasing in the double digits. So it's not   that one side of that equation is really crushing it and the   other one is stagnating. Both sides are performing well. And I   think that's what you want to see.Niu:Yeah. And they also had mentioned the music   business, which had been declining for quite some time,   for many years. Before Apple got into the streaming   side, when it was all the download business for music, as   people shifted toward streaming, that business was shrinking.   Now, we're back to this inflection point where music is   growing again. If you include both download and streaming -- so   both iTunes plus Apple Music -- if you combine   them, the music business as a whole is now growing again.   That's always nice to see, particularly as the shift   toward streaming continues, more and more people   are willing to pay. The industry itself really likes   the shift to paid streaming versus ad-supported streaming.   And Apple is a big proponent in that transition. That's also   another good sign. They are really helping the music   industry grow as a whole, as well as their cut of the whole   music business growing again.Lewis:And you have to like that, considering that they   are, what some people might argue, kind of a late   entrant into streaming music. You already   had Spotify with tens of millions of people using   it, and you might have wondered what adoption might have   looked like for Apple Music and the streaming service.   But results seem to be pretty good so far.Dylan Lewisowns shares of Apple.Evan Niu, CFAowns shares of Apple. The Motley Fool owns shares of and     recommends Apple.

Could Snap Inc. (SNAP) Make Its Own iPhone Killer?;2/10/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSnap Inc(NYSE:SNAP) isn't yet a publicly traded company. But in the runup to the Snapchat IPO, the social media company is making big plans for the future.makeArticleAd();That involves hardware that seems to include a smartphone designed to compete withApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) and its flagship iPhone.Snapchat parent Snap Inc. has already made a move into hardware with Spectacles, a cleverly named set of smart glasses that are designed to work with its social media app. You cancheck out a demoof Spectacles here on the company's YouTube channel.But that could only be the beginning. Many experts have recently speculated that Snapchat will be developing its own phone soon to coincide with the IPO of SNAP stock.

Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Targeting a Triple-Digit Return;2/10/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIt has been a good, but volatile, ride forAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) shareholders in 2017. Now supports are once again firming up both off and on the price chart for GOOGL stock. And for shorter-term investors, a bullishly targeted butterfly is one way to position and capture a nice profit range with limited risk in lieu of owning shares of Alphabet.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockWhen it comes to large-cap tech outfits like Alphabet,political risksranging from China to net neutrality to immigration laws remain a question mark. But waiting on a resolution is like waiting on Godot.It may take a while. As well, those eventual outcomes could always prove beneficial to GOOGL.Of course, there are also the potential political supports, such as cash repatriation and favorable corporate tax cuts, to consider. Not only is passage of such legislation more popular and likely easier to push through Congress, it would certainly be a boon for Alphabet.What's more, GOOGL stock is looking great again after its recent earnings report. Bottom line,earnings missed but growth is back.With its Q4 results, Alphabet proved its business focuses outside the company's bread-and-butter advertising search revenues, are starting to pay-off for the company.10 Super-Safe Dividend Growth Stocks to Buy TodayFor one, mobile search and YouTube both showed strong results and helped with Alphabet's overall ""exceptional"" year-over-year sales growth of 24%.But newer investments are also coming into their own. The company's aggressive shift into hardware such as its Pixel smartphone,AI-enhanced Homeand virtual reality helped Alphabet grow its ""other revenues"" by more than 62% on sales of $3.4 billion.GOOGL Stock Daily ChartAway from Alphabet's overall bullish narrative off the price chart, GOOGL stock is showing technical support for a long stake by investors.Following a fairly stiff post-earnings bout of profit-taking from brief all-time-highs, Alphabet has managed to find support from a Fibonacci zone, key price pivot dating back to last February's high, as well as the intermediate-term, 50-day simple moving average.Looking forward, targeting the post-earnings high of $867 appears logical. At roughly 4% from current prices, but with no overt company-specific catalysts on the immediate horizon to push GOOGL shares aggressively higher, I like the idea of using a targeted long butterfly spread.GOOGL Stock Bullish Call Butterfly SpreadTiming is everything. This is especially true with options strategies as calls and puts are wasting assets. Ourlast discussion on Alphabet optionsis intimately aware of this, as a lower-risk, bullishly placed long butterfly literally expired one day and $1 dollar short of cleaning up.I suppose you could say the last trade got trumped.Nevertheless, in looking at Alphabet's options and given what has been addressed, the GOOGL March $845/$860/$875 is attractive.Hate Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock, But Love This TradeWith GOOGL trading at $833, the out-of-the-money and bullishly placed butterfly is priced for $2.20 per spread, or less than one-third of one percent of the GOOGL stock price. A maximum profit of $12.80 or return approaching 600% would occur if GOOGL rallied by 3.25% over the next month and landed on the sold center strike $860 call at expiration.The desired and very precise outcome for maximizing returns is not a high-probability event by any stretch. However, with its limited risk, profit range from roughly $847 to $873 and maybe the use of a 50% stop loss in the event profit-taking turns into something more ominous, a GOOGL stock butterfly looks well positioned for the situation.Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in any of the securities or their derivatives mentioned in this article.

Hate Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock, But Love This Trade;2/10/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsUnder a month ago, I wrote about howit wasn't too late to create free profitsfromApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) stock. The trade yielded almost $5 in pure profits. I gained $3 from my debit call spread appreciation and $2 from selling the naked put.makeArticleAd();Now Apple stock sits near its all-time highs making it difficult to recommend an entry point. Furthermore, other mega-caps likeAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN),Facebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) orAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG,NASDAQ:GOOGL) have more obvious entry points.So is it too late to set another long trade in AAPL? I don't think so; there is still time to set another trade using options for another potential run of free profits.Fundamentally, Apple stock still is a money printing machine with a rosy intermediate outlook. I have my concerns about its leadership though; I strongly believe that Tim Cook will ruin Apple, but not in the next few months. Meanwhile, and if markets in general don't suffer a sustained correction this year, AAPL should be higher through 2017.7 Marvelous Mid-Cap Stocks to Buy for the Best of All WorldsClick to EnlargeTechnically, AAPL has a few constructive points. First, it made a wide rounding bottom rejecting the last swoon.Also, I think that if Apple stock sets a new high it would invite more frantic buyers who were leery of the potential of another double top.The Trade:Buy the AAPL April debit $135/$140 call spread. This is a bullish trade for which I pay $1.40 per contract to open. If Apple rallies well past my spread, I stand to triple my money. The price I pay to open the trade is the maximum I could lose. Usually I like to lower my exposure. In this case, I want to sell downside risk premium to finance the purchase of my calls or more. It's difficult to do so near all-time-high levels, but not impossible.The Bank:Sell the AAPL Jan 2018 $105 put. This also is a bullish trade for which I collect $3 per contract to open. By selling naked puts I am committing to buying the stock at the strike sold if Apple stock falls below it. But even if that bad scenario unfolds, I would have bought the stock at a 20% discount from today's levels. This trade has a 90% theoretical chance of success.As long as AAPL stock stays above my put sold, any premium I collect from selling my debit call spread can be pure profit. So if price action becomes too bearish, I could sell back the debit call spread for a profit even if the price I get is lower than my entry price.Apple Inc. a 50% Dividend Grower Hiding in Plain Sight (AAPL)I am not required to hold my trades through their expiration dates.

Nvidia Shows Artificial Intelligence Revolution Is Biggest Trend Of Our Time;2/10/2017;"Nvidia (Shutterstock photo)It's no secret that Nvidia (NVDA) was the best performing stock in the S&P 500 in 2016, gaining more than 370%. But while the company's graphics processor unit (GPU) chips are being used in everything from gaming PCs to autonomous cars to virtual reality to data centers, the reinvigoration of Nvidia is built by one thing: artificial intelligence.AI is increasingly being used in everything and everywhere, most notably data centers for machine learning, where Nvidia's GPUs have a tremendous lead over the competition, including anything from AMD (AMD) and Intel (INTC). Data center revenue was up 67% year-over-year in the quarter at $296 million and more impressive, up 23% from the impressive fiscal third-quarter 2017 results that helped send the stock soaring more than 30% in November 2016.makeArticleAd();The technology is touching everything and anyone, be it on your smartphone or when you shop on Amazon (AMZN) or using software. In fact, Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang toldBarron'sthat AI is just the future of software.If you read Nvidia's conference call transcript and itsearnings press release, AI is mentioned everywhere and with good reason: deep learning is only made possible by the advancements in AI being made by university researchers and big companies such as Google (GOOG), Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB), Amazon and others.In reacting to the blow-out earnings results, Jefferies analyst Mark Lipacis called Nvidia essentially the only publicly traded company solely focused on AI. ""[Nvidia] posted its 7th consecutive beat, and while YoY rev growth of 55% likely marks 2nd derivative peak, the 200% growth in its Datacenter business and improving GM reinforce our thesis that NVDA is emerging as the de facto standard in AI - one of the most exciting growth drivers in tech,"" Lipacis wrote, while raising his price target to $140 from $125.Of the aforementioned areas, perhaps the one that is most tangible to show consumers the AI revolution is autonomous driving.Tesla (TSLA) and CEO Elon Musk have pioneered autonomous driving in the Model S (though to which extent is up for debate), but Tesla has chosen to use Nvidia's chipsets to not only help it with its infotainment unit, but more importantly, the software that helps withautonomy, using the NVIDIA DRIVE™ PX 2 AI computing platform.Society is a little bit away from true autonomy in a car (Level 5), in which a human does not need to do anything, but Tesla is working on getting towards Level 4/5 faster than anyone else, thanks to Nvidia. (For a good primer on what each level means, clickhere.)Nvidia has several other automotive partnerships, including recently announced ones with Bosch andAudi.All of this highlights that self-driving cars is not just a science fiction fantasy, it's real and it's coming. And it's being powered by AI. The societal impact AI will have is up for debate, whether it will be a net positive or a net negative, but there is no stopping it.AI is continuing to become more prevalent in everything we do, but we are nowhere near general AI, in which computers can make decisions just as a human can. What we're experiencing right now is soft (weak) AI, in which humans tell a computer to do a task and it does it better than any human can. But thanks to deep/machine learning, we're getting closer to general AI, even if it's still decades away. That means the AI revolution is only just getting started and it has years and years on which to run.All thanks to Nvidia."

Better Buy: Skyworks Solutions, Inc. vs. Qualcomm;2/10/2017;"Though investing is filled with uncertainty, occasionally, the   answer to a certain question is as clear as day. Today, that   seems to be the case in comparing semiconductor companiesSkyworks Solutions(NASDAQ: SWKS) andQualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM) , as the recent movements of their stock prices   suggest.QCOMdata byYCharts.makeArticleAd();Clearly, the market had voted in favor of Skyworks' stock over   that of Qualcomm lately, but is that trend likely to continue? In   this article, we'll run Skyworks Solutions and Qualcomm through a   three-part analysis to better understand which company's stock is   the better buy today.Qualcomm vs. Skyworks: Financial fortitudeComparing the solvency and liquidity metrics for Qualcomm and   Skyworks, the two chip companies are both in fine financial   shape, as you can see from the following chart.CompanyCash & InvestmentsDebtCash From OperationsCurrent RatioQualcomm$29.7 billion$11.6 billion$6.0 billion2.0Skyworks Solutions$1.1 billion$0$1.2 billion7.2Data sources: Qualcomm and Skyworks investor relations.In terms of their near-term liquidity, Qualcomm and Skyworks   each carry far more current assets than current liabilities,   although Skyworks' deserves special praise for its particularly   conservative quick ratio. Neither company appears to present much   in the way of liquidity risk. Furthermore, Qualcomm and Skyworks   Solutions both employ conservative capital structures. Qualcomm   can easily service its outstanding obligations from either its   current cash balance or its operating cash flows. Here too,   though, Skyworks wins since it eschews borrowing altogether and   still generates plenty of cash.It also briefly deserves noting that Qualcomm's balance sheet   composition will certainly change when its pending acquisition of   Internet of Things (IoT) chipmakerNXP Semiconductorcloses at some point this year. Qualcomm will finance the deal   using its overseas cash reserves and by issuing bonds. Though   Qualcomm management reiterated that the deal shouldn't interfere   with its ability to meet its various obligations -- notably its   dividend -- Skyworks' impressive financial footing and Qualcomm   further leveraging its balance sheet, albeit for a productive   propose, earn Skyworks a clear win in this category.Winner: Skyworks SolutionsImage source: Getty Images.Qualcomm vs. Skyworks: Competitive analysisSkyworks and Qualcomm both enjoy powerful business models,   though each has a few important risks that could derail their   investment theses under the wrong circumstances.Qualcomm is the leading provider of mobile application   processors and baseband chips, which enable mobile devices to   connect with 3G and 4G networks. Its Qualcomm CDMA Technologies   (QCT) segment produces about two-thirds of the company's revenues   and generates pre-tax margins that typically hover in the high   teens. Qualcomm's true profit center, though, is its Qualcomm   Technology Licensing (QTL) segment. Thanks to Qualcomm's pivotal   role in developing 3G and 4G standards, the company has   historically been able to generate royalty revenue from every   device produced by mobile OEMs. Though small a percentage of its   total sales, this QTL's royalty revenue is essentially pure   profit, enjoying an 85% pre-tax margin.Critically, Qualcomm's patent licensing practices have come   under immense pressure from ahost of lawsuitsin recent years, which creates a genuine amount of doubt as to   the durability of Qualcomm's profit center, adding a substantial   amount of risk to a company with an otherwise attractive business   model.Looking to Skyworks, the company manufactures over 2,500   chips, including analog semiconductors, switches, and amplifiers,   to a roster of over 2,000 customers. At a high level, Skyworks'   competitive advantages lie in its unique ability to bundle an   increasing number of complex connectivity functions into a   single, space-saving chip. This unique ability made Skyworks an   invaluable supplier to smartphone and tablet makers, and the   company has been handsomely rewarded as mobile devices have   proliferated in the past decade.Looking to the future, Skyworks sees an opportunity to provide   similar solutions to the booming Internet of Things market. By   the year 2020, the company believes there will be 1 billion   personal computers, 2 billion smartphones, and a whopping 43   billion Internet-of-Things-enabled devices operating   globally, and it hopes to provide chips for as many of these as   possible. Though the future indeed looks bright, it's important   to note thatAppleaccounts for 40% of Skyworks' revenue today, so its performance   is disproportionately influenced by Apple's component orders.Winner: SkyworksQualcomm vs. Skyworks valuation analysisTurning to the third section, here's a quick snapshot of three   of the most commonly used valuation metrics for both Skyworks and   Qualcomm.CompanyP/EForward P/EEV/EBITDAQualcomm13.911.29.3Skyworks Solutions19.324.818.4Data source: Yahoo! Finance.In reviewing the metrics, both Skyworks and Qualcomm largely   seem appropriately valued. Qualcomm is expected to grow 1.2% this   year and 2.8% next year. This kind of tepid top-line expansion   combined with its current legal overhang justifies Qualcomm   trading at a fairly compressed multiple. Analysts expect Skyworks   to grow sales 8.6% this year and 10.3% next year. Though above   average, this doesn't merit the same kind of aggressive premium   we see right now at other semiconductor names likeNVIDIA. Though not the sexy call, both companies look fairly valued   today, in my eyes.Winner: TieAnd the winner is...SkyworksAt the end of the day, Qualcomm's outsized legal risk loomed   fairly large in this decision. Though Qualcomm maintains its   innocence, an adverse ruling could materially impact the   company's financial performance or, worse yet, its highly   lucrative business model. Meanwhile, Skyworks' outlook remains   largely favorable looking into the long term, though its   over-reliance on key customers remains far from ideal. Both   companies have positives and negatives, but Skyworks seems like   the better buy today.10 stocks we like better than Skyworks SolutionsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Apple Inc. a 50% Dividend Grower Hiding in Plain Sight (AAPL);2/10/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThere are two ways to get big dividends: you can buy stocks that boast highcurrentyields, or you can buy stocks that consistently grow their payouts.makeArticleAd();A well-balanced portfolio will include both types of companies, withdividend-growth stocksbeing the cornerstone of a longer-term income strategy.Still, investors sometimes get frustrated with dividend growers because to get their outsized payout growth, you often have to settle for a low current yield. And why buy a risky asset that yields 1% when you can get a long-term Treasury that pays 2%?There are two answers to this question. The first is that Treasuries aren't risk-free. If you buy a 10-year note and interest rates go up, the value of your Treasury will go down. If you need to sell early for some reason, you'll lose money.Secondly, dividend-growth stocks will increase their income over time-something Treasuries will never do. In fact, if you choose thebest dividend growth stocks, you'll see your income skyrocket in a few short years.And the best dividend growth stock is one of the world's most recognizable and popular brands:Apple Inc.(AAPL).If you read about investing in Apple, you almost always see a focus on iPhone sales, the value of future products and so on. Bears note slowing iPhone sales growth (or negative sales growth), devices that didn't quite catch on and rising competition. Bulls counter that Apple has a valuable and unique market position and innovative products that captivate consumers.Both arguments are really missing the point.The main reason to buy Apple is more boring but more important: net income, free cash flow (FCF) and dividends.Let's start with FCF, which is now $9.65 per share, meaning Apple's dividend-payout ratio is a measly 24%. But the really amazing thing is how the company's cash flow has exploded and continues to rise:FCF Boots UpYes, there's been a bit of a dip in the last year, but you can also see that FCF has already bottomed out and is now back on the rise.7 Tech Stocks With Explosive Growth PotentialThe next thing to consider is Apple's operating margin, which is currently 27%. This is important because it means the company is so profitable that it can continue to pay out dividends at the current payout rate. That operating margin has fallen slightly in recent years, partly as a result of changes in the smartphone market, but it's still historically high:Apple Remains a Profit MonsterNote that we've seen Apple's profit margin remain over 25% since 2009. This is great news for investors, but it also means Apple has become a very different company than it was in the 1990s and 2000s. It's no longer a burgeoning tech firm but an enterprise that reliably and consistently produces cash it can distribute to shareholders. In other words, it's a blue chip stock, not a speculative bet.Again, great news for investors-especially those looking for income. Ironically, many dividend-growth investors forget about Apple, or they may allocate a very small part of their portfolios to the company out of fear that it's risky. That's a mistake.In the last five years since Apple started paying dividends, its payout has soared 50.6%:Strong Dividend GrowthIf we compare that to some of the most popular and supposedly ""safer"" dividend payers, we see that Apple's dividend growth is a big outperformer:Apple Trounces the RestAs you can see,General Electric Company(GE), AT&T Inc.(T), Johnson & Johnson(JNJ), Chevron Corporation(CVX), Consolidated Edison, Inc.(ED)andExxon Mobil Corporation(XOM)are all growing their dividends at a slower pace than Apple.The tech giant also has a lower P/E ratio than all of these names (just 15.6, which is 39% lower than the rest of the S&P 500).It's time to think different about Apple; this is a relatively safe dividend stock that is destined to be a Dividend Aristocrat. While headlines about iPhone sales may cause some volatility in the short term, the company's strong cash generation will reward you with big payouts in the long run.Buy Apple Now … Then Add These 6 High YieldersThere's no doubt Apple is a best-in-class dividend-growth stock. But you also need high yields to go with that dividend growth-especially if you're in or near retirement.Should Bill Gates Sell His Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock?That's where the 6 reliable income generators in our new""No-Withdrawal"" retirement portfoliocome in. They throw offrock-solid yields of 6%, 8%, 9% and up.And with an average yield of 8.0%, this portfolio willeasily hand you a $40,000 income stream on a $500,000 nest egg.Each of those payouts is backed byrock-solid balance sheetsandsurging cash flows.Like Apple, these income powerhouses are all cheap now, but I don't expect that to last.These no-drama plays are perfect for 2017, with the market starting to look twitchy after the go-go ""Trump bump."" Don't miss out.Click here and I'll share our 6 top picks for high income and double-digit upside.More From InvestorPlace7 Cheap Stocks to Buy That Could Double in 2017The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for 2017: The Experts' PicksThe postApple Inc. a 50% Dividend Grower Hiding in Plain Sight (AAPL)appeared first onInvestorPlace."

Apple's China Business Is Bouncing Back;2/10/2017;"Investors were fretting throughout 2016 aboutApple's(NASDAQ: AAPL)  business in China, which has stumbled amid   intense competition from local smartphone vendors. In this   segment fromIndustry Focus: Tech, Motley Fool analyst Dylan Lewis and contributor Evan Niu, CFA,   discuss Apple's outlook in the Middle Kingdom.A full transcript follows the video.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better     buys.Click hereto learn about these picks!*Stock Advisor returns as of February 6, 2017This podcast was recorded on Feb. 3, 2017.Dylan Lewis:Another area that I think we should spend a little bit of time   focusing on here is some of the international   results, specifically China. I know that four out of Apple's   five geographic operating segments set fresh highs -- all   but Greater China. But, China is really seen as a huge   market opportunity in addition to India, for Apple. Do you want   to put a little color out as to what they said in the call?Evan Niu:Yeah. Like you mentioned, more quarterly records in   terms of all the other geographical segments, which,   again, it's all these little things that are   contributing to this overall overperformance. For   example, Japan grew 20%. Japan is not a huge market for   them, but just the fact that they can still put out   meaningful growth numbers ... Europe was pretty much flat.   But, Greater China, it has bounced back quite a bit sequentially.   In the third quarter, sales were something like $8.7 [billion] to   $9 billion. So, to really bounce back to $16 billion, it's shy of   their all-time record, which was set a year or two ago, around   $18 billion, but it is bouncing back on a sequential basis.   I think there are still lingering concerns about the   smartphone market in China, because it's getting really   competitive with all these low-cost Chinese   vendors really proliferating and flooding the market with   these cheap choices. You can see in their numbers that they've   had trouble in the past year as competition intensifies   on the ground. But I still think that China is a very big,   promising business. It's probably going to be a tough place to   compete. But it's a great market. They're still   growing, they still have to expand the retail footprint.   There's still room to run.Lewis:Yeah. With lower-priced entrants coming into the   market, Apple's brand cachet is only going to give it so much   pricing power. But, you have to think there's still some room to   run there.Dylan Lewisowns shares of Apple.Evan Niu, CFAowns shares of Apple. The Motley Fool owns shares of and     recommends Apple.

So Why Not Buy Apple?;2/10/2017;"ByWexboy:We all know the type: Born-again value investors who still have that new car smell. No longer clueless, but the market hasn't beaten adequate sense (or humility) into them just yet, so they're still insanely overconfident. Which we tolerate - after all, we were like them once - then they start expounding their new and improved value investing philosophy, and it all goes downhill. I recall one encounter, some years back, where I struggled to get a word in, let alone offer some kind of reality check. Finally, my new guru was forced to pause and finally breathe, so I did the only sensible thing. I lobbed this hand grenade:So why not buy Apple?All I got was a puzzled look. Repeating the question, I then pummeled him with a veritable laundry list ofApple(AAPL) fundamentals and ratios. If he was such a value expert, surely Apple was a screaming value buy? Needless to say, I never got much of a reply, but it stopped him in his tracks and scared him off. Job well done! But the more I thought about it, the more it seemed like a valid question for other investors (and even me). And a question to be asked in a spirit of honest inquiry. I mean, let's look at Apple's numbers today:makeArticleAd();- Net sales have reached $216 billion (as of FY-2016).- Net sales increased by 99% and over 1,000% in last 5 and 10 years, respectively.- Gross margin increased to 39% ($84 billion) in last 10 years.- Operating profit margin more than doubled to 28% ($60 billion) in last 10 years.- Net income increased by 76% and almost 2,200% in last 5 and 10 years.- EPS compounded by 16% pa and 38% pa in last 5 and 10 years.- Net cash and investments increased almost 1,400% to $151 billion in last 10 years.- Current share price (as of cob Feb-7th): $131.53- Current market cap: $690 billion- Current Price/Sales ratio: 3.2 times- Ex-net cash and investments Price/Sales ratio: 2.4 times- Current P/E ratio: 15.7 times- Ex-net cash and investments P/E ratio: 12.1 times- Current FCF ratio: 13.2 times- Ex-net cash and investments FCF ratio: 10.1 timesOk, just take a moment and marvel. Even with the share price now approaching all-time highs again, surely Apple's still a screaming value buy?So why not buy Apple?Ever since, I pose this question to fellow value investors on a regular basis; but I'm not sure I've ever received a satisfactory reply! As in: 'Yes/No, I bought Apple/I decided not to buy Apple - based on a detailed analysis, and the following specific attributes.' Instead, people tend to shrug their shoulders, roll their eyes, flash a rueful grin, and maybe toss out one of the usual objections. I'm sure you can guess a few:- But Apple's market cap is almost $700 billion now!- It's far too well-researched and efficiently priced for investors to ever have an edge.- A much cooler/better/cheaper brand will surely come along for the kids to buy.- It will inevitably hurtle off a cliff into technological obsolescence and irrelevance.- The micro-cap, sum-of-the-parts thesis we discussed is far more interesting.- Steve Jobs is dead… the company's sure to go off the rails any day/month/year now.- Look at thebloody chart- who's going to buy it now, after that rally?Now, before the fanboys start to lose their minds, this is where I should reveal this post is NOT about Apple. No, really.Sorry, fanboys…Study the long-term chart of any outstanding growth stock, and it's quite obvious most of the objections above are just red herrings. Part of a litany of excuses too many value investors trot out to justify hiding within their own circle of comfort. Because we fear the risks and challenges of the unknown. Instead, we reject (or simply ignore) entire sectors and hundreds/thousands of companies, because we've decided they're just too large, too expensive, too unpredictable, too uninteresting, to be worthy of consideration.And then we citeBuffett: Always remain within yourcircle of competence!Except this rule would imply buying no individual stocks - since newbie investors should always choose passive investing initially, as the most prudent choice. And anyway, Buffett evolved his investing approach and continually expanded his circle of competence over his entire career. [Yefei Lu'snew Buffett bookoffers good perspective]. Mere mortals should emulate such an evolution - not Buffett himself! Unless you plan on being a deca-billionaire too - then you can avoid/invest in absolutely anything you fancy.Let's not forget, when Buffett started out, technology was a nascent sector - which required a VC approach - something he clearly wasn't too comfortable with. [But readPhilip Fisheragain: Now, he was a great venture capitalist - albeit one who chose to invest in listed companies]. And technology-related hype/promotion during theGo-Go Yearsprobably compounded this aversion, which Buffett rationalized as avoiding the sector's obvious unpredictability. Except that never stopped him from investing in the likes of banks and retail! Which are potentially just as lethal and unpredictable, but obviously they were sectors in which he was actually comfortable investing.But in sticking religiously to his comfort zone, Buffett also displayed his true genius. His apparent caution is deceptive - rest assured, he never doubted his investing ability. Instead, he deliberately chose to leverage his prowess in a new and more aggressive way, via the use of long-term, interest-free insurancefloatanddeferred taxes. Of course, the potential risks of taking on such significant leverage would ensure he remained laser-focused on investing (primarily) in predictable sectors and businesses, and obviously inspired his two main rules:Rule No. 1: Never lose money.Rule No. 2: Never forget Rule No. 1.Couple this with super-human patience and fifty years later it seems almost inevitable Buffett's actually accrued an entirely unique investment record.Whereas we don't have the luxury of float. And it's 2017: We live in a world where technology and innovation play an ever increasing role, for decades now, in all aspects of our economy, workplaces and daily lives. And technology isn't (necessarily) any more unpredictable than biotech/pharma, fashion, media, retail, natural resources, emerging/frontier markets, etc. But it deserves far more focus and study - since its potential impact on other sectors, in terms of innovation and disruption, is obviously far greater today (and as we look ahead). [Withautonomous trucksnow being tested on open highways, it's both astonishing and alarming to realizetruck drivingmay still be the most common male occupation in the US! (with almost 3 million drivers)].A value investor who deliberately avoids technology and other such (unpredictable) sectors is foregoing a world of investment opportunity - especially now, when an ever increasing share of economic value-creation is derived from technology, not to mention other intangible assets and intellectual property. And trapped in a low-growth, low-return world (like today - or in due course, as debt and entitlements keep escalating), such investors may end up condemned to choosing between: i) traditional blue chip/Buffett classics (e.g. food and beverage stocks) which now seem to trade at ever-expanding multiples (vs. historic and prospective earnings growth), or ii) traditional value stocks which can perhaps no longer rely on a rising tide of growth, inflation and animal spirits. Who can afford such risks and opportunity cost?But for many value investors, we're far more comfortable with the numbers, rather than the story itself. Which is, potentially, our downfall [And vice versa for growth investors]. The hard assets and cheap metrics of your typical value stock offer the siren song of safety, whereas investing in high quality/growth stocks may require a far more demanding leap of faith. Except value stocks are often mired in bad management, bad business models, bad industries and dreadful capital allocation - with little hope of compounding their intrinsic value - the best we can hope for is a realization of intrinsic value.If you're a human computer who loves to re-rank and re-invest in the world's cheapest stocks every day, such an event-driven portfolio may be rewarding (and the studies do claim value beats growth), but in the real world how many investors manage to deliver sustained long-term outperformance with such an approach? Maybe a passive, computer-driven portfolio is the better solution, especially when the greatest human computer of them all (i.e. Buffett) has long since abandoned such an approach. In the end, value investing will always be a marvelous valuation tool and framework for investing, but its greatest failing doesn't lie in the stocks it green-lights for you to buy…It actually lies in the stocks it persuades youNOTto buy!I suspect most value investors will freely acknowledge this failing. And embrace the proposition that investing in high quality/growth stocks is ultimately a far more attractive way of compounding long-term portfolio value (particularly on a tax-deferred basis),IF ONLYit weren't so difficult! Because such an investing approach must inevitably be driven by qualitative, not quantitative, analysis. And it conflicts with having our cake and eating it - we want the best companies and the best prices! In reality, we need to compromise and choose wonderful companies at fair prices, not fair companies at wonderful prices. Which actually offers a far more compelling value equation, since time is the friend of the wonderful company, the enemy of the mediocre.And so, paying up is often required - well, at least from a traditional value perspective - which, almost inevitably needs to be justified via comprehensive study of the company and its management, its capital allocation, its products and business model, its industry dynamics, and (most of all) whether it enjoys a significant, sustainable and (ideally) an expanding competitive advantage (i.e. aneconomic moat). An exercise which is surely infinitely more challenging than assessing and ranking a bunch of value metrics. And one which can go horribly wrong - a busted value thesis may engender some rueful sympathy (wow, who knew management were such idiots?), but paying up for a high flier just before it collapses will inevitably attract a perfect storm of hindsight and sniggers for making such a bone-headed investment decision. But then again, nailing even a single multi-bagger growth stock might yield a payoff value investors can only ever dream of.Of course, today the answer might not be Apple. But next up there's a world of other compelling investment opportunities out there just waiting to be explored. Which means it's still an excellent question to kick off your search:So why not buy Apple?See alsoRevlon Corp.: Will This Sleeping Giant Come Back To Life?on seekingalpha.com"

Warren Buffett's Best Stocks of 2017 So Far;2/10/2017;"We're just over a month into 2017, so let's look at how the   Warren Buffett-ledBerkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK-A) (NYSE: BRK-B) stock portfolio has done thus far.   Berkshire itself is almost completely flat for the year, down   0.09% as of this writing, but some of the company's stock   holdings have done quite well. Specifically, five of Berkshire's   stocks have gained 10% or more over the first five weeks of the   year.CompanyStock SymbolmakeArticleAd();Share Price (2/7/2017)YTD PerformanceLiberty Media (A Shares)LBTYA$35.54+16.2%Moody's Corp.MCO$107.06+13.6%AppleAAPL$131.53+13.5%Charter CommunicationsCHTR$323.37+12.3%VisaV$85.78+10%Performance and share prices as of market close on   2/7/2017.Image Source: Getty Images.1. Liberty Media (+16.2%)Liberty Media(NASDAQ: LBTYK) has been Berkshire's biggest winner thus far in   2017, thanks to impressive growth in its European markets. The   company expects the growth to continue as it speeds up its U.K.   build activity and makes major investments in its business there.   In addition, the company has been aggressively repurchasing its   shares, especially in the wake of the Brexit sell-off last   year.2. Moody's (+13.6%)Ratings agencyMoody's(NYSE: MCO) has steadily climbed so far in 2017, partially   because of its announcement that it had resolved pending civil   claims with the Justice Department, 21 states, and D.C. Not only   were the claims resolved faster than many experts expected, but   the cost to the company will be significantly less than many   expected.3. Apple (+13.5%)In part,Apple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) rally has been due to its strong results from   the holiday shopping season. For the quarter, Apple's revenue of   $78.4 billion was as high as it has ever been, and the company's   earnings and revenue both handily exceeded expectations.Perhaps most importantly, Apple's service revenue (which   includes sales from the App Store, iTunes, Apple Music, Apple   Pay, and others) grew by 18% year-over-year. While this accounts   for just 9% of the company's results, it is rapidly becoming an   important revenue stream to the company. Furthermore, Apple   expects revenue to continue to climb in the current quarter, and   CEO Tim Cook said that the company is ""excited"" about the   products in its pipeline.4. Charter Communications (+12.3%)InCharter Communications'(NASDAQ: CHTR) case, the reason for the strong stock performance   wasn't necessarily due to strong growth or other great business   metrics. Rather, the stock spiked in mid-January on rumors thatVerizon(NYSE: VZ) was considering an acquisition of the company. Many   think that the deal is unlikely to happen, for reasons my   colleague Anders Bylund explained in a recentarticle, but the rumors have not faded just yet.5. Visa (+10%)In its latest quarterly report,Visa(NYSE: V) reported impressive year-over-year earnings growth of   7%, and revenue growth of 25% thanks to the acquisition of Visa   Europe.Service revenue, data processing revenue, and international   transaction revenue all soared, and while operating expenses grew   by 16%, the company still posted impressive growth.

Alphabet Inc. Takes Another Shot at Amazon With Home Control;2/10/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAlphabet Inc.'s(NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Home connected speaker takes onAmazon.com, Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AMZN) Alexa on its home turf. But what about Google's big advantage over Amazon in the smart home war - all those smartphones?makeArticleAd();Source: GoogleThe company has just begun rolling out Home Control, a new feature that lets Google Assistant control smart home devices by voice.However, at this point, Home Control - like Google Assistant - remains a feature that's exclusive to Google's own Pixel Phones.The Battle for the Smart HomeGoogle Home is a connected speaker with Google Assistant baked in. Owners can use Google Assistant on the speaker to answer questions, find music and control a growing number of smart home devices using their voice only.The device is GOOGL's answer to the Amazon Echo. Amazon's Alexa-enabled speaker has been a surprise hit and allowed Amazon to take a big lead in the race to become the smart home hub - despite the distinct disadvantage of lacking a smartphone platform to host its digital assistant.Google has Google Now and the new Google Assistant, whileApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) has Siri. Between them, the two companies have billions of mobile devices in consumers' hands, yet Amazon still managed to leapfrog them with its personal assistant hosted in a speaker, to build an impressive smart home lead.Apple's Siri can control HomeKit-compatible smart home devices using voice commands, and now GOOGL is rolling out asimilar feature for its Google Assistant, Home Control.Home ControlGoogle's new feature for voice control of smart devices isn't actually new. Anyone who owns both a Pixel Phone and a Google Home speaker already had a Home Control setting on their smartphone.10 Super-Safe Dividend Growth Stocks to Buy TodayHowever, as of yesterday, GOOGL has begun to roll out Home Control to all Google Assistant users. This amounts to all Pixel Phone owners, since Google Assistant remains an exclusive that third-party Android smartphones don't get.With Home Control, someone with a Pixel Phone gets the same voice control ability for smart devices they would have if they owned a Google Home speaker. They can use voice commands on their phone to change the temperature on their Nest Learning Thermostat or turn off the smart lighting in the room they just left.The Battle for the Smart Home Enters a New Phase (Sort of)At the start of this fight to be the company that becomes the hub of the smart home - the one who controls all those smart devices - the smartphone was it.Smartphones ran all the apps that controlled each of the devices and everyone owned one. With smartphones, the battle came down to iOS and Android, Apple and Google.Then Amazon disrupted everything with the Echo and Alexa. With thousands of compatible products and services, consumers have been snapping them up. Amazon sold out of the Echo at Christmas, afterselling nine times moreof the smart speaker than the previous year.Voice control is in. Having to poke buttons on a smartphone is out.Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Finally Fires Back at Apple With Android Wear 2.0However, Apple and Google are not about to cede the smart home to Amazon. GOOGL began its assault on Amazon with the Google Home smart speaker to directly take on the Echo and Alexa. With Home Control, it's bringing voice control of smart devices to the smartphone, leveraging its massive lead over Amazon when it comes to numbers. There may be millions of Alexa-powered homes, but there are billions of people already carrying an Android smartphone.Except, most of those people still won't be able to use Home Control. GOOGL has baked Home Control into Google Assistant, a feature that's been exclusive to its Pixel Phones since they were released last fall. With Google Home and now Home Control, Alphabet clearly has Amazon's number. The question will be whether Amazon gets Alexa into more third-party devices before Google decides to let third-party Android smartphone makers have access to Google Assistant.For GOOGL, the decision comes down to which is more valuable: maintaining a key competitive advantage for its own Pixel Phones, or giving up that Google Assistant and Home Control exclusivity to take a real shot at unseating Amazon in the smart home.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceNo, Apple Inc.

"News Corp (NWSA) Q2 Earnings Top; Soft Ad Market Hurt Sales";2/10/2017;"Rupert Murdoch-controlled,News CorporationNWSAreported profit in second-quarter fiscal 2017 after posting loss in the previous quarter.  Moreover, the company's earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate driven by robust performance of digital real-estate and book publishing units. However, the company's revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second straight quarter primarily due to soft print advertising demand and foreign currency headwinds.News Corporation registered adjusted earnings of 19 cent a share outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny but declined 5% year over year. Including one-time items, the publisher of The Wall Street Journal and New York Post reported net loss from continuing operations of 50 cents a share compared with earnings of 15 cents posted in the year-ago period.News Corporation, which split from Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc.FOXA, stated that its total revenue for the reported quarter was $2,116 million, down 2% from the year-ago quarter and below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,137 million. Adverse foreign currency fluctuations hurt total revenue by $53 million.The company's adjusted revenues (excluding the impact of acquisitions, foreign currency fluctuations and divestitures) came in at $2,110 million, reflecting a decline of 1.3% year over year.Total advertising revenues declined 8.3% to $748 million, while circulation and subscription revenues fell 4.2% to $595 million. Consumer revenues increased 4.9% to $450 million, while revenues from real estate climbed 15.6% to $185 million. Meanwhile, Other revenues gained 2.2% to $138 million.News Corporation, which offers e-books for devices sold by Amazon.com Inc.AMZNand Apple Inc.AAPL, is in a transitional phase, looking to diversify revenue streams, along with expanding digital properties through product launches and accretive acquisitions.Following the results, the company's shares gained 1.6% in after-hour trading session yesterday. In fact in the past one year, the stock has performed mostly on par with the Zacks categorizedMovie/TV Production/Distributionindustry gaining more than 19%.Segmental PerformanceRevenues from theNews and Information Servicessegment declined 7% year over year to $1,303 million in the reported quarter. Adjusted revenues fell 5% from the prior-year period. Advertising revenues decreased 9%, hurt by the adverse impact of foreign currency fluctuations and softness in the print advertising market, partly offset by $22 million from the addition of Wireless Group and increased in-store product revenues at News America Marketing.Circulation and subscription revenues dipped 5%. However, excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, the figure inched up 1% on account of increase in subscription pricing, selected rise in cover prices in the U.K. and Australia and jump in paid digital subscribers, partly neutralized by fall in print volume. Digital revenues accounted for 27% of segment revenues in the quarter under review compared with 22% in the year-ago period. Adjusted segment EBITDA declined 10% during the quarter to $142 million.TheBook Publishingsegment reported revenues of $466 million, up 4% from the prior-year period owing to continued success of backlist titles comprising Hillbilly Elegy by J.D. Vance, and Sarah Young Jesus Always and Jesus Calling. Digital sales which constituted 16% of consumer revenues increased 3% in the quarter. Adjusted revenues for the segment rose 6%. While adjusted EBITDA for News Corporation's book publishing business surged 35% to $77 million.Revenues at theDigital Real Estate Servicessegment advanced 16% year over year to $242 million on the back of sustained growth witnessed across REA Group Limited (up 19%) and Move (up 7%), along with the buyout of iProperty and Diakrit. Adjusted revenues grew 10% in the quarter under review, while adjusted EBITDA increased 31% to $92 million.TheCable Network Programmingsegment's revenues came in at $104 million, down 2% from the year-ago quarter primarily due to decline in affiliate and advertising revenues.

Pandora (P) Earnings: Fourth Quarter Loss Widens;2/10/2017;"Like a broken record that skips, investors continue to ask when Pandora (P) will ever make money?The company’s inability to prove its business model can be lucrative has cost investors tons of money over the past three years, during which Pandora stock has fallen more than 65%. On Thursday it was the same old song. Shares of the internet music giant declined as much as 4% in after hours trading session after the company reported a wider loss in the fourth quarter, driven by higher expenses.In the three months that ended December, the Oakland-based company reported a loss of $90 million, or 38 cents per share. On an adjusted basis, when taking out one-time gains, costs and stock option expense and pretax expenses, the loss was 13 cents per share, which beat Wall Street estimates by 8 cents. Fourth quarter revenue came to $392.6 million, up about 17% year over year and also topping Street forecasts.makeArticleAd();""We made significant progress in 2016 by driving leverage in our core business while accelerating subscriptions to our paid product,"" said CEO Tim Westergren, in a statement. Adding that the company is now ""laser-focused"" on growing ad-supported business and launching subscription products and an artist-to-fan platform.Pandora, which has been subject to frequent acquisition rumors linking it to Apple (AAPL) and Sirius XM (SIRI), has struggled to grow profits since the bulk of its users don’t pay anything. To diversify the business, which has been bogged down by music licensing fees, the company recently launched Pandora Plus and Pandora Premium subscription services.Still, the fact that the lion share of its revenue (about 80%) still comes from advertising, not subscriptions, Pandora still has a long way to go. And despite being a smaller segment of the business, Subscriptions only brought in under $60 million, climbing just 5% year over year. This, too, suggests that Pandora is struggling to compete on the premium side with market leaders Spotify and Apple.All told, these numbers — on their own — aren’t as bad as the stock’s decline might suggest. The fact that Pandora reported a smaller loss than what analysts expected shows that the company, which has promised to cut 7% of its US workforce, is reining in on costs. As to why the stock is down despite the earnings and revenue beat?This was likely a “sell the news” type of event. The management had already removed the element of surprise by announcing last month that the results would surpass guidance. With the stock rising some 21% over the past month, investors were hoping for something more breathtaking."

Nvidia (NVDA) Earnings: Why This Q4 Beat Was Really Important;2/10/2017;"Nvidia earnings (Shutterstock photo)It appears the only thing now strong enough to stop Nvidia (NVDA) stock from climbing higher are investors’ expectations. Thanks to the company’s advancements in cutting-edge technologies such as deep learning and artificial intelligence (AI), NVDA shares have soared some 340% over the past year, crushing every important index.As such, the California-based semiconductor giant had lot to prove Thursday. And with top- and bottom-line numbers that cruised by even the most bullish forecasts, Nvidia answered the call. But the shares appear muted, falling as much as 3% in the after-hour session. From my vantage point, this decline, which I consider inconsequential, is victory for Nvidia and its investors. I’ll get back to that in a moment.makeArticleAd();Let’s go though the numbers.In the three months that ended December, Nvidia reported net a income of $655 million, or 99 cents per share. On an adjusted basis, when taking out one-time gains and costs, earnings came to $1.30 per share, which beat consensus estimates by a whopping 30 cents. Fourth quarter revenue also beat, coming in 55% higher year over year to $2.17 billion. The Street was looking for revenue of $2.11 billion.The strong bottom-line beat was driven by record quarterly GAAP gross margin at 60.0%, the company said, while non-GAAP gross margin at 60.2%. When looking back at fiscal 2016, the company broke several of its own records, including full-year revenue of $6.91 billion, which grew 38% from a year ago.""We had a great finish to a record year, with continued strong growth across all our businesses,"" said CEO Jen-Hsun Huang in a statement. ""Our GPU computing platform is enjoying rapid adoption in artificial intelligence, cloud computing, gaming, and autonomous vehicles. Huang also added that Nvidia’s deep learning GPUs (graphical processing units) has made a breakthrough approach to AI, which can now help in early cancer detection, weather prediction and is helping to tackle challenges such as self-driving cars.All told, it is these breakthrough areas that continue to drive interest in NVDA stock. Admittedly, I wasn’t a believer until now. And while the tech battle has always been between Apple (AAPL) Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN) and Facebook (FB), those guys are not alone anymore.In terms of the 3% decline on these solid numbers? Nvidia is being shown the respect it now deserves. Even if the stock were to decline 5% to 10% — after a 340% one-year rise — it would still imply the momentum story is still in place. And Nvidia’s Q1 outlook for revenue to be $1.9 billion, which surpass Wall Street estimates of $1.88 billion, suggests it sees no signs of slowing down."

No, Apple Inc. Is Not Releasing the iPhone 8 Early;2/10/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsA report began circulating several days ago thatApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) may start production of the iPhone 8 early. Typically, when a company starts manufacturing sooner than usual, that points to an accelerated release date for a new product.makeArticleAd();Source: AppleIn this case, it seems unlikely the move will result in an iPhone release date before Apple's standard September launch.If not to get it on shelves sooner, why would the company want to get an early start on new iPhone production?The iPhone 8 Early Production Ramp UpApple has a pretty standard roadmap when it comes to new iPhone releases. With a late September iPhone release date, the company starts to ramp up production of the new model in late summer. However, this year it looks as though Apple may be breaking with tradition.According to a report from BlueFin Research Partners, there are indicators in the company's supply chain that point to an unusually early production ramp up for the iPhone 8. Quoted inMSN Money,the BlueFin report notes:""The most intriguing data points that we have uncovered suggests that Apple is ramping the next generation iPhones earlier than historical norms.""Why Early Production Won't Lead to an Earlier iPhone Release DateBefore anyone gets too excited about the possibility of an early iPhone 8 release, that scenario is highly unlikely.First, ramping up production in June means Apple will begin having stock of the new iPhones in warehouses by the summer. But no one releases a flagship smartphone during the summer months - that's a slow time for consumer technology news. People are on vacation and not only would an iPhone announcement not get the coverage Apple expects for its new product launches, with so many people away the line-ups at Apple Stores the company is hoping for wouldn't happen.3 Warren Buffett Stocks to Buy in the Trump EraAn early release would also reduce iPhone 7 sales. Now that production is humming on that model, Apple wouldn't want to kneecap it by releasing the iPhone 8 early.So Why Would Apple Ramp up iPhone 8 Production Early?It's become increasingly obvious that companies like Apple are pushing the limits of their supply chain and manufacturing partners with their latest smartphones. The new dual camera system, haptic Home button and other components led to a shortage of some iPhone 7 models at launch. Apple ramped up production in late summer as usual,but these issues caused delays.I preordered an iPhone 7 Plus, but still waited a month after the new iPhones went on sale before mine was available …Then there's the issue of batteries. Apple has had to face its own headaches withiPhone 6 and 6s batteries, but those problems pale in comparison to the nightmare rivalSamsung Electronics Co Ltd(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) has gone through with the Galaxy Note 7 and its exploding batteries.There's a lot riding on the iPhone 8 and Apple appears to be throwing all sorts of new features, cutting-edge technology and a completely new design at its 10th anniversary iPhone. Glass construction, wireless charging, an OLED display, virtual Home button and more. The company is even rumored to becharging $1,000-plusfor its new flagship, an unprecedented price for a smartphone.In addition, Samsung will likely be introducing its new Galaxy Note around the same time, and pulling out all the stops to make that phablet such a smash hit that everyone forgets about the Galaxy Note 7.Alphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) is also expected to release the followup to the worryingly successful Google Pixel Phone in the fall.Rather than ramping up for an early launch, it's far more likely that Apple is starting iPhone 8 production early in order to iron out all the manufacturing bugs early. Virtually all of the components will be new and Apple will undoubtedly be pushing the limits of manufacturing capability. Having an early start will ensure any issues are caught well before the iPhone 8 goes on sale, ensuring a smooth, scandal-free, launch. And no embarrassing issues for the competition to take advantage of.The early ramp up also ensures that even if things don't go smoothly at first, there will be plenty of iPhone 8 smartphones sitting in Apple warehouses in September, ensuring a record-setting launch.Should Under Armour Inc (UAA) CEO Kevin Plank Step Aside?Despite the apparent early production ramp up, don't expect an iPhone release date in the summer. But Apple's move does mean you should have a flawless iPhone 8 in your hands at the launch, instead of waiting weeks or months for supply to catch up to demand.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace12 Stocks That Will Live and Die by Donald Trump's Pen7 High-Risk, High-Reward Stocks to Buy NowThe postNo, Apple Inc.

Despite Generous Capital Returns, Apple Inc. Still Has More Cash Than Ever Before;2/9/2017;"Apple's(NASDAQ: AAPL)  overseas cash position continues to grow   at an incredible rate, and the possibility of some type of   repatriation holiday is the highest it has been in years, thanks   to the new Trump administration.In this segment fromIndustry Focus: Tech, Motley Fool analyst Dylan Lewis and senior technology   specialist Evan Niu discuss Apple's cash position and financial   structure.A full transcript follows the video.makeArticleAd();10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run     for over a decade,Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has tripled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy right now... and Apple wasn't one of them!     That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better     buys.Click hereto learn about these picks!*Stock Advisor returns as of February 6, 2017This podcast was recorded on Feb. 3, 2017.Dylan Lewis:Speaking of their international segments, I think it might   make sense to check in on their cash hoard a little bit. As of   their recent report, Apple is sitting on $246 billion in cash.   Because they do so much business outside of the U.S. and   because of certain current tax regulations, $230 billion of that   total, or roughly 94%, is held outside the U.S. Morgan   Stanley analyst Katy Hubertyasked [CEO] Tim Cook on the call about what the company   might be thinking with the current administration, and the   possibility of repatriating some of that cash. I think that was a   question a lot of people wanted an answer to.Evan Niu:Yeah. That's one of the big things that the Trump   administration is pushing, is this tax reform, including a   potential repatriation holiday. If they could bring back a lot of   that cash, there are certainly a couple things they could do   with it. Cook didn't really give a lot of clear guidance on   what he's thinking. But, you could buy some companies.   He keep saying that Apple is open to really big   acquisitions if they fit, if they make sense, all these   things. But he's basically not concerned about pricing anymore.   You could buy some companies, you could invest in the   U.S., you could potentially bring production back.   Obviously, that's another big thing that Trump is pushing.Another thing I would actually like to see is strengthen   the balance sheet. The whole reason they have the $70   billion-plus in debt is because it's always been a way to   avoid the repatriation taxes. So, if they can repatriate at   appealing rates, it might also make sense to pay down some   of that debt, because that way, you can avoid some of the   interest expense, and it strengthens your balance sheet a little.   Not that the balance sheet is weak, by any stretch of the   imagination. It all nets out in the end. But, logistically,   it would be nice to bring that money back, pay down some debt.   Because, if this is a one-time deal that they can bring back   a ton of money, I would expect them to keep generating   ridiculous amounts of cash overseas, and then they would want to   raise more debt, again, to be able to tap that, in the   same way they have been doing, but if they could pay down that   debt, that basically gives them even more time to keep   pursuing the same strategy. And if they're taking advantage   of a one-time tax holiday, I think that would make sense,   from a corporate finance standpoint.Lewis:Yeah. Even with $70 billion in debt, where they had to   repatriate a lot of that cash that's held overseas, they   still have quite a bit to work with. I think on the call,   Huberty specifically asked about what merger and acquisition   activity to expect, or if they might continue to invest   in original content and programming that would make the   Apple ecosystem seem a little bit more appealing. I think because   she led with that question and had some specific examples of   where cash might go, Cook's response followed along with   that. But, I was hoping we might get some color about   an increase in the dividend, or an update on what the   company was thinking with share repurchase where they'd have   that extra capital on hand. But, nothing there at the   moment. Cook was notoriously cagey, as always, in his   response.Niu:Yeah. He didn't really give a lot away there.   They usually update their capital return program every   April. So, next quarter, we will get some insight. They did   buy back $11 billion in shares this quarter. Which partially   helps juice the earnings-per-share number, which is another   record, because they are able to retire so many   shares. They retired something like 62 million shares last   quarter. That's really highly accretive to that   earnings-per-share figure, even though net income was   actually down slightly relative to a year ago, in part   because of foreign exchange headwinds and things of that   nature. So, right now, they are up to about $144 billion   in cumulative repurchases, and the current authorization is   $175 billion. So they still have plenty of room. They only   have one more quarter before they update it again.   But I would expect them to give another update and increase   it again in a couple months, because this   business creates so much cash that they literally have   no idea what to do with it. [laughs] I mean, think   about how much money they have given back, and the fact that   they still have more money now than they've ever had before. So,   it's like, they're trying to give this cash back at this   ridiculous rate, but they generate so much of it that it   still adds on a net basis to their total cash position, even   after giving back so much over the years. It's mind-boggling.Lewis:And that's with them continuing to invest in the   future, as well. You hear about some of the different   projects that they may or may not be funding, and some of   the initiatives they might be pushing. It's not like   they're sitting on their heels here. They're certainly   throwing money into seeing where tech might be going. It's just   that, with this type of money available to them, you can   only do so much of it with reinvesting in the business and with   R&D. I mean, that's the beauty of having a cash cow   business like that.Niu:It's just insane how much they make.Dylan Lewisowns shares of Apple.Evan Niu, CFAowns shares of Apple.

Voice Control Platforms a Key Technology Trend in 2017;2/9/2017;"Technology companies have spent years on computational linguistics to solve the basic problem of making machines more efficient in an era where they would have to deal with bigger data loads and more complex queries. One of the products of this research is voice driven artificial intelligence that can connect and drive everyday devices to understand human speech and react accordingly.The most basic form of voice technology is a person directing a machine to do routine tasks such as play a track, read the mail, send automated response to mails and such things that Apple'sAAPLSiri, Alphabet'sGOOGLGoogle Now or Microsoft'sMSFTCortana took care of. Home automation is a more recent trend and wouldn't it be cool if most of the smart devices/appliances used in the home can also take voice commands? And sync with each other to decide the desirable activity and then get it done?Amazon AheadWhile Microsoft has many years of research behind it, it is AmazonAMZNthat has really taken voice controlled platforms mainstream. The company launched its first Echo device a couple of years ago and sold more than seven million devices last year. While many of them were the cheaper Dot, it still puts Alexa, Amazon's voice assistant into that many new homes.At this year's CES, Amazon had a coup as companies ranging from FordF, Huawei and LG to a large number of startups unveiled phones, cars, home appliances and other gadgets with Alexa integration making Amazon's voice assistant that much more useful.And Amazon has doubled down to develop Alexa's ""skills,"" which are discrete voice-based applications that allow the system to carry out specific tasks (like ordering pizza for example). At launch, Alexa had just 20 skills, which has reportedly jumped to 5,200 today with the company adding about 100 skills per day.In fact, Bezos has said, ""We've been working behind the scenes for the last four years, we have more than 1,000 people working on Alexa and the Echo ecosystem … It's just the tip of the iceberg.""Just last week, it launched a new website to help brands and developers create more skills for Alexa. It also has a home consultation service called ""simplify your life"" where Amazon reps teach you to automate your home using Echo and Alexa. But all this works simply because everything is connected with AWS, which transmits data between different devices.Amazon.com, Inc. Price and ConsensusAmazon.com, Inc. Price and Consensus|Amazon.com, Inc. QuoteGoogle Has Jumped InAmazon is clearly the leader in voice controlled platforms today, but competition is in hot pursuit. Google Home was launched late last year and the search leader will do all it can to grow market share.To prove the point Google too had some important announcements for the Google Assistant, which drives Google Home. But some of the most important deals were for integrations into Hyundai's navigation system, Chrysler's 300 model, NVIDIA'sNVDAShield TV as well as others such as Belkin smart switches, Switchmate smart lights, Coway Airmega air purifiers, etc. Google still has miles to go before it catches up with Amazon, but it's made a strong start.Google has the most to lose if it can't make it big here because a lot of voice search will probably happen through these assistants going forward. But it also has an advantage, i.e., all the information it has curated over the years, your preferences and your habits that it can draw from to serve you. In short, it knows you better.Alphabet Inc. Price and ConsensusAlphabet Inc. Price and Consensus|Alphabet Inc. QuoteApple Also in the FrayApple doesn't have a separate Home device, but a useful app of the same name that can connect all the smart devices in your home and get them to communicate with each other. So it's also dependent on the number of gadget makers supporting the app and this number has been swelling in the recent past.While Apple's partners aren't making the news as much as the other two, there are a host of switch, light, camera, sensor, security system and other such device makers that have been announcing their support for Apple's platform the last couple of CESs (Apple makes it a point to stay away from the show).Apple Inc. Price and ConsensusApple Inc. Price and Consensus|Apple Inc. QuoteSamsung Taking NoticeSamsung paid a cool $8 billion to acquire auto infotainment, acoustics, display and other systems supplier Harman. That is a big sum to pay, although justified considering that Harman does offer a number of products that would be complementary with the displays and chips that are an important part of the increasingly electronic and soon-to-be self-driving cars. IHS iSuppli expects the market to grow from $42 billion in 2016 to $61 billion next year.But there's more: just last year, Harman announced a number of collaborations indicating its growing importance in the world of voice activated controls. In September, it agreed to incorporate Baidu speech recognition and synthesis technology in smart speakers so people can use voice commands to turn on audio experiences and access on-demand services.Earlier, the two collaborated to create CarLife offering advanced Internet capabilities, entertainment features and location-based services on HARMAN's in-vehicle infotainment head units for the Chinese market. At the World of Watson conference last October, Harman collaborated with IBM to bring voice activated intelligent assistance based on IoT and cognitive computing to hotels, offices and hospitals across the world.Along Comes SoundHoundKeyvan Mohajer of SoundHound says, ""We are at the inflection point of our long-term vision that every product or service needs to have a smart voice-enabled interface, and consumers have increasingly high expectations for this requirement, beyond simple commands or skills,"" said Mohajer.He may be right because of the $115 million raised in its 10-year long life, $75 million was contributed just last week from a group of companies including NVIDIA, Samsung's Catalyst Fund, Nomura Holdings, Sompo Japan Nipponkoa Insurance, Recruit Holdings' RSI Fund, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, SharesPost 100 Fund and MKaNN. Global Catalyst Partners, Walden Venture Capital and Translink Capital Partners participated for a second time.The reason the investment is significant at this juncture is SoundHound's voice interface technology called Houndify that will now be empowered to reach more users. Houndify was incorporated into more than 500 products within the first 12 months of launch.Its popularity in the past and why companies like Samsung and NVIDIA are interested in it right now is simple. The technology is not designed to take over the device or transfer data to SoundHound unlike platforms like Alexa and Google Home. So its proliferation will let device makers employ the technology and also retain user data. Houndify already has 20K developers working on the platform and this number could expand rapidly with the cash infusion. Houndify already hasSumming UpInteraction with machines is set to become more interesting than ever before as they gradually understand our needs to get things done the way we want it even before we tell them to or perhaps right after. Since this is a nascent market, there may not be any clear winners. Right now it does look as if there's enough growth opportunity for all the above players and more.Zacks' Top 10 Stocks for 2017In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2017?Who wouldn't?

Best ETFs Of 2017 Target Growth Stocks, Gold Miners, Brazil Small Caps;2/9/2017;"[ibd-display-video id=458207]Growth stocks provided a rich seam of gains for   domestic stock ETFs in the past month, as shares of tech   leadersFacebook(FB),Adobe(ADBE) andApple(AAPL) rekindled after noticeably lagging the postelection   rally.Investors in exchange traded funds were in a perhaps exuberant   mood as stock market volatility hit its lowest level in   years and the venerable Dow Jones industrial average crossed   the psychologically key 20,000 mark, Matthew Bartolini and David   Mazza of State Street Global Advisors (SSGA) wrote in a   recent note.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');A risk-on mood seems to prevail amongETF   investorsas ""the current U.S. equity bull market is less than 30 trading   days away from its eighth birthday,"" they added.However, there are some yellow flags.""Valuations are elevated and earnings growth is positive, but   not overwhelming so,"" said Bartolini and Mazza. ""Confounding the   exuberance is the fact that bond market volatility remains   decidedly elevated, nearly 6% higher than prior to the election,   while equity volatility has fallen by over 36%.""SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) climbed 0.9% in the month ended Feb. 8, padding gains of 2.6%   year to date and 12% in 2016.International stock ETFs did even better in the past   month.Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets (VWO) advanced 4.4% and iShares MSCI EAFE (EFA), investing in foreign   developed markets, added 1.2%.Equity ETFs listed in the U.S. notched just under $30 billion   in net inflow in January - the third month in a row since   the Nov. 8 election that investors poured more than $25 billion   into equity ETFs, according to SSGA. Fixed income ETFs saw $13.41   billion in net inflow last month, following the record $90   billion of fresh assets they gathered in 2016.Looking ahead, Bartolini and Mazza suggest that truly   exuberant ETF investors should consider allocating to ETFs   tracking sectors that may benefit from President Trump's   policies, such as real assets, oil and gas producers and regional   banks.Other ETF investors may want to position for downside risk in   thestock marketand consider investing in gold, they added.These are among the year's best-performing ETFs in   some key asset classes, screened for trading volume:Diversified U.S. EquitiesFirst Trust Nasdaq-100 Equal Weighted (QQEW) gives every stock   in its underlying tech-focused, nonfinancial index an equal share   of assets. The equal-weighting method gives this large-cap   growth ETF a significant midcap stake.Its 108 holdings include railroad giantCSX Corp.(CSX), electric carmakerTesla(TSLA) and biotech firmIllumina(ILMN) - stocks that have sizzled so far in 2017.QQEW is up 7.1% this year through Feb. 8 on the back of a   4% gain in the past month. It has a 0.6% expense ratio.The market-cap weighted version of the index, as tracked by   PowerShares QQQ (QQQ), is up 6.8% year to date.Sector EquitiesVanEck Vectors Junior Gold Miners (GDXJ) bets on an asset   class that was badly beaten down in the first half of this decade   but has since burnished its allure.It invests in 52 global gold- and silver-mining firms   includingIamgold(IMG) andAlamos Gold(AGI), with a pronounced tilt toward small- and midcap firms.GDXJ has vaulted 33.7% so far in 2017 and 19.2% in the   past month, extending a superb 72.9% rally last year.   It charges investors 0.56% of their assets for expense fees.International EquitiesIShares MSCI Brazil Small-Cap (EWZS) also tracks a basket of   commodity-tied stocks that are rebounding nicely after a tumble   in the first half of this decade.The portfolio holds 59 stocks, with a heavy slant toward   consumer sectors.

The iPhone is Growing Again -- Here's How;2/9/2017;"Last quarter, the iPhone broke a trend of three consecutive   quarters of unit declines, thanks to the launch of the iPhone 7   and 7 Plus. In this segment fromIndustry Focus: Tech, Motley Fool analysts Dylan Lewis and Evan Niu, CFA discuss   howApple's(NASDAQ: AAPL)  most important business is faring.A full transcript follows the video.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run     for over a decade,Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has tripled the market.*makeArticleAd();David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy right now... and Apple wasn't one of them!     That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better     buys.Click hereto learn about these picks!*Stock Advisor returns as of February 6, 2017This podcast was recorded on Feb. 3, 2017.Dylan Lewis:Why don't we hop right into the iPhone segment? This is   really where they're making most of their money.Evan Niu:Yeah. They sold another record of 78.3 million. The last   three consecutive quarters, they put up negative growth. So,   they put an end to that trend. Of course, this creates   another tough comparison for next year, raises the bar for a year   from now. But, personally, I wasn't that impressed with the   iPhone 7 as a product.Lewis:Do you own it?Niu:No. It's the first time in eight years that I haven't   upgraded my phone. [laughs]Lewis:I don't own the iPhone 7 either, so don't feel   bad. [laughs]Niu:But, literally every year I've been upgrading, this is   the first time I'm not, because I just didn't think it was   that compelling. But, obviously the market really does. Part   of it is that the 7 Plus is really the hot seller this   quarter. Apple even acknowledged that they did a poor   job predicting demand. They allocated less than they should have   to the 7 Plus production. There's not really a killer   feature in the iPhone this year. Arguably, the biggest thing is   the dual camera system that is specifically for the 7 Plus.   So, it seems like a lot of people are picking that bigger   phone. I think it costs $120 extra now. You can see it in the   numbers. They put up really strong results here.Lewis:Yeah. And I think you really see that when you look at   average selling price. That grew to $695 in the most recent   quarter, up from $619 in the previous quarter. And a lot of   that is the 7 Plus model, and consumers clearly voting for   the better camera, and being willing to pony up a little bit   more dough for it.Niu:And/or extra storage, because those things shoot 4K   video, and you need a lot of storage to store all that.Lewis:Yeah. absolutely. So, if you put those two   numbers together, the units and average selling   price, you get roughly $54.5 billion in revenue.   So, right now, we're looking at the iPhone segment making up   about 70% of revenue for Apple for this quarter. Higher   than it's been in the past, but not necessarily   surprising, because the iPhone segment was so massively   popular and so successful this quarter.Niu:Yeah. They were so supply constrained the entire   quarter. They acknowledged that they didn't meet supply-demand   balance until January. So, they were pretty short   on inventory throughout the entire quarter. To still be able   to hit these numbers even with constraints   and, arguably, not a super strong feature set -- I was   kind of blown away, honestly.Dylan Lewisowns shares of Apple.Evan Niu, CFAowns shares of Apple.

Apple, Inc. iPhone Sales in China Reportedly Fell 18% Last Year;2/9/2017;"China has been the world's largest smartphone market for a few   years now, underscoring how important the region is forApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) . But the Mac maker has hit a speed bump in the   Middle Kingdom in recent quarters, largely due to intensifying   competition from local, low-cost manufacturers. The company   occasionally mentions growth rates for various geographical   markets, but doesn't disclose unit sales by region in detail.   That leaves investors having to rely on third-party estimates,   and the most recent ones don't look good.We're No. 5! We're No. 5!Market researcherCanalysreleased its estimates today for the Chinese smartphone market in   2016. Total unit volumes in China hit a fresh high of 476.5   million handsets, up 11%. Of that total, roughly 131.6 million   units were shipped in the fourth quarter, a quarterly record that   represents a third of the global market. The top four brands were   all Chinese manufacturers; Apple came in at No. 5 amid declining   unit volumes.ManufacturermakeArticleAd();2016 UnitsHuawei76.2 millionOppo73.2 millionVivo63.2 millionXiaomi51.4 millionApple43.8 millionData source: Canalys.Both Xiaomi and Apple saw double-digit declines from 2015   levels, with Xiaomi's units falling 21% and Apple's units down   18%. Oppo and Vivo exploded onto the scene in 2016; both   companies sold fewer than 40 million units in 2015. Huawei   strengthened its position in the tier-one and tier-two cities,   according to Canalys analyst Jessie Ding. Oppo and Vivo are now   looking to target those regions, while Huawei moves in on   tier-three and tier-four cities.iPhone 7 with AirPods. Image source: Apple.While Apple has never aspired to be the largest vendor in any   market by volumes, instead focusing on other things like customer   satisfaction and profitability, that's still a discouraging   directional trend at a time when Apple has been trying to   reinvigorate investor confidence. The iPhone maker's decline in   China is also significantly worse than its worldwide volumes;   iPhone units fell 7% in 2016 to 215.4 million. If we look at it   in absolute units, Canalys' numbers suggest that Apple sold 9.7   million less units in China in 2016, which is a large proportion   of the 16.1 million unit decline in total iPhone units.

The weakness appears to be coming from Hong Kong and   Taiwan, and revenue in mainland China was roughly flat with the   record levels from a year ago. Here's CEO Tim Cook on the   call:If you look at how we did in the quarter, as I think Luca     shared, our Greater China revenue was down 12% and about 4     points of that was currency related. So it's an 8-point decline     in constant currency. And then within Greater China if you look     at the [People's Republic of China], our revenue was flat year     over year, and that was against the all-time record     quarter.Cook also conceded that Hong Kong ""remains a very, very   difficult market.""10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Thursday Apple Rumors: iPhone 8 May Cost Over $1,000;2/9/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsLeading theApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) rumor mill today is news of a possible price for the iPhone 8. Today, we'll look at that and otherApple Rumorsfor Thursday.makeArticleAd();iPhone 8 Price:A new rumor claims that Apple's iPhone 8 may cost more than $1,000, reportsMacRumors. According to this rumor, the tech company is planning to introduce several new features to the redesigned device. Features that the company may include are an OLED display, wireless charging, the lack of a physical Home button, 3D sensing technology and more memory. If these rumors hold true, then it isn't hard to see how the device will surpass the $1,000 price point. The iPhone 7 Plus with 256GB of memory costs $969 in the United States. This rumor comes from sources that are close to AAPL's plans.2017 iPhone Charging:A recent rumor claims that Apple will introduce wireless charging to all three 2017 iPhone devices,9to5Macnotes. This rumor comes from KGI analysts Ming Chi Kuo. Previous reports have claimed that only the premium 2017 iPhone, which may be the iPhone 8, will offer wireless charging. This rumor also claims that the premium iPhone coming out this year will feature an OLED display and a 3D Touch sensor. Kuo claims that the premium device will require an extra layer of graphite to protect the 3D Touch sensor from heat caused by the wireless charging component.Beats X Deal:Apple is offering a special deal to customers that purchase its new Beats X earbuds, reportsAppleInsider. Customers that pick up the new earbuds will also get a free three-month subscription to Apple Music. This news comes from an early unboxing video of the earbuds.

How Universal Display Corp. Gained 17% in January;2/9/2017;"What happenedShares ofUniversal Display(NASDAQ: OLED) rose 17.2% in January 2017,according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.So whatThe big driver of Universal Display's January gains came from   Chinese electronics manufacturing giantFoxconn. The company publicly ""mulled"" a $7 billion investment in a   U.S.-based manufacturing facility, equipped to provideApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) with high-quality smartphone and tablet   screens.The U.S. factory plan dovetailed nicely with rumors that the   next few generations of Apple iPhones might ship with OLED   screens. Furthermore,Foxconn recently acquired screen maker Sharpfor a cool $5.1 billion, and that company had already dipped its   toes into OLED waters before joining the Foxconn mother ship.makeArticleAd();Put all the pieces together, and it starts to look as if Apple   and Foxconn might want to order quite a bit of OLED equipment and   materials in the reasonably near future. Universal Display shares   gained more than 12% in three days, based on this collection of   circumstantial evidence.Image source: Universal Display.Now whatThe American Foxconn factory is still an unconfirmed rumor,   and we certainly don't know for sure how Foxconn might use such a   facility. However, the volume of harmonizing rumors has   increased. This week, aReuters reportreaffirmed that Sharp is taking the lead on Foxconn's $7 billion   factory-building plans in America, citing unnamed insider   sources.So the Apple rumors remain neither confirmed nor debunked, but   the sheer weight of similar third-party reports is making the   whole thing sound plausible. And if that wasn't enough, Universal   Display just announced a $15 million investment to double   materials manufacturing partnerPPG's(NYSE: PPG) OLED emitter capacity over the next three   quarters.Next up, Universal Display is slated to report fourth-quarter   results on Feb. 23.10 stocks we like better than Universal DisplayWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) Stock Is More Valuable Than You Think;2/9/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAs I write this,Amazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) stock trades at about $824 per share. For 2017, analyst consensus estimates are that AMZN stock will earn $7.25 per share for the full year. That gives Amazon stock an astronomical forward price-to-earnings ratio of nearly 62x. In comparison, theS&P 500as a whole trades at about 17x next year's earnings.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockIn other words, AMZN stock trades at a multiplenearly six timesthat of the average large-cap U.S. stock.Of course, this isn't a new phenomenon: For years, investors have considered Amazon stock overvalued based on a P/E ratio that has often been in the triple digits - and, not all that long ago, negative.Yet AMZN stock seems to defy gravity: Shares are up 50% over the past year, 110% over the past three years and a stunning 340% over the past five years. The reason is that Amazon isn't a stock that should be valued solely on next year's earnings, or the price investors are paying for those earnings. That's not because the market is crazy when it comes to AMZN stock and it's not because the fundamentals ""don't matter"". It's because Amazon is investing now for growth later - and that's exactly what itshouldbe doing.AMZN's Earnings Aren't the Only ThingIt's tempting to think that a stock with a lower P/E ratio is by definition ""cheaper"" than other stocks. Why would an investor pay 50x, or 100x, a year's earnings when he or she could pay 15x, or 10x? Growth certainly matters.7 Tech Stocks That Are Bucking the DowntrendIntuitively, an investor understands that 18x earnings for a bad business isn't obviously better than, say, 22x earnings for a good business. In fact, it may be worse. But the P/E ratio for Amazon stock seems ridiculous on its face. AMZN is already the biggest retailer in the world; is it really going to show so much growth that it's worth paying a 100x P/E? It would have to grow its profits by a factor of five just to get the multiple to 20x, which doesn't sound cheap itself.However, that type of analysis is generally too simplistic. A stock is valued based on the sum ofallits future cash flows - not just next year's. That's true for AMZN stock, and it's true forMacy's Inc(NYSE:M) stock as well.The fact that AMZN trades at 62x 2017 earnings and M trades at 10x doesn't, in and of itself, prove anything. It seems almost certain that the earnings and cash flow attributed to AMZN stock will continue to rise; it seems highly likely that Macy's earnings will, in contrast, fall. The rates at which those earnings rise or decline matters, of course, and those rates inform how investors value AMZN stock or M stock.But whether a stock is valued at 100x P/E or 3x P/E, investors need to take a long-term outlook. And while it may not appear like it at first glance, that's exactly what many AMZN stock holders are doing.The Two Ways For Amazon Stock to Grow EarningsEven those investors who are mostly bearish on Amazon stock would likely admit that Amazon's earnings will continue to grow going forward. But the bearish argument - one that has been made for the better part of a decade - is that it's almost impossible for AMZN earnings to growthat much. After all, as a company gets bigger, its growth rate fades, simply due to its size. (SeeApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) for a perfect example.)At some point, the optimism that keeps Amazon stock at nosebleed levels will fade - and AMZN stock will come back to Earth.But that argument assumes that Amazon is at nosebleed levels, which may not be the case. The heavy-handed P/E ratio sounds highly stretched; however, according to AMZN's most recent 10-Q, it generated $8.6 billion in free cash flow over the last four quarters. That implies a sub-50x multiple to free cash flow ona trailing basis -a slightly less intimidating multiple. And the focus on P/E ratio also ignores that there are two ways for Amazon to grow earnings.The first is the standard way that companies grow earnings: higher sales and better margins. There's little reason, barring an economic recession, to see AMZN's sales declining. Even then, increased market share could allow Amazon to post revenue growth, if not at the 29% pace seen through the first three quarters of 2016.There's also reason to see AMZN's margins expand considerably. Somewhat incredibly, on a GAAP basis, Amazon's operating margin year-to-date is just 3.2%. Yet the company has built out an incredible distribution platform and it has invested billions of dollars in its Amazon Web Services business. Incremental sales thus should boost margins considerably; it takes very little in the way of investment to sell a few more items, or add another cloud customer.3 Reasons Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock Is STILL the KingAMZN still has years of benefits from the scale it has built out, and those benefits will continue to expand margins for some time, allowing for steady, and even explosive earnings and cash flow growth.The second issue relative to current and 2017 earnings is that Amazon isn't currently maximizing its profits. Rather, it is spending - sometimes wildly - on a variety of initiatives, offering everything from restaurant delivery to photo printing to Prime Video and Prime Music subscriptions.Some of those efforts will work; many likely will fail. But looking at 2016 and 2017 earnings and not considering the impact of that spending is as short-term as buying AMZN stock in 2017 simply because it rose in 2016. Amazon's operating expenses are on pace to increase almost $10 billion year-over-year in 2016. A good chunk of that is coming from hiring employees, marketing the new businesses and creating the distribution platforms for various projects.Assume, then, that AMZN decided to focus on near-term earnings, instead of investing now for the future. Simply limiting that increase to $5 billion would come close todoublingAmazon's earnings and cash flow next year. Ignoring that new spend ignores the 'true' earnings power of AMZN stock.Bottom Line on AMZN Stock: It's ComplicatedThis is not to say that Amazon stock is necessarily a buy. As a value investor myself, I still question the valuation of AMZN stock in my own way. But simply checking the P/E ratio for AMZN - or any other stock - is too simplistic. Trying to value Amazon stock is a messy, difficult, detailed endeavor. The Amazon Web Services business is vastly different from the price-sensitive, low-margin, online retail business. It's not clear how much AMZN is spending on its new projects, and how much it could save.It's complicated. But so is investing the right way. And simply ignoring - or shorting - Amazon stock because of its P/E ratio isn't the right way to do it. There are reasons to be optimistic, and pessimistic, toward AMZN stock, but those reasons go well beyond a single number.As of this writing, Vince Martin did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceThe Top 10 Dow Dividend Stocks for February12 Stocks That Will Live and Die by Donald Trump's PenThe postAmazon.com Inc.

A Win-Win Trade for Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Bulls;2/9/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) is looking better and better both off and on the AAPL price chart. But following a massive rally, a well-positioned bull put spread trumps buying Apple stock near-term.makeArticleAd();Source:Yuanbin Du Via FlickrIt has been almost exactly one month since I penned some bullish analysis on AAPL onJan. 10. At the time, there were plenty of potential headwinds for Apple stock. And to be honest, many of those factors, ranging from trade, to China, to a successful transition as asoftware company, could still present issues for Apple.Nevertheless, I didn't mind throwing caution to the wind given a dose of contrarianism, a decent Apple stock chart and firm control on risk using an April bull call spread. And I'm glad I did, as Apple stock has gone on to make its investors very happy and in more than one way.Back on Jan. 31, Apple managed to delight Wall Street by not only beating top- and bottom-line views, but also in the quality or tire-kicking aspect of the results. There were typical highlights, such as $18 billion in profits for the quarter, 78.3 million iPhones sold and a record cash hoard of $246 billion, whose size is simply amazing. But this report was also much more than that for Apple stock.The companyshowed a return to growthspearheaded by executing with its increasingly important Services business that includes the App Store, iCloud, iTunes and Apple Music.7 High-Risk, High-Reward Stocks to Buy NowApple also dropped hints of a major media acquisition, expanding AAPL's reach into smart homes, and, somewhere in the dazzling dog-and-pony show, the buzz  over this year's forthcoming iPhone 8 iteration.Another way the company has made its investors very happy of late has been on the Apple stock chart.Apple Stock Weekly ChartA month ago, I discussed a bullish cup-and-handle pattern which had just cleared the 62% retracement level as Apple stock broke out on its daily price graph. The area is highlighted in yellow on the provided weekly stock chart of AAPL.Now, with shares up about 11% and focused on the larger time frame, a similar but more substantial corrective cup formation has emerged since Apple stock hit its all-time high in 2015.Looking forward, there's nothing to stop Apple stock from breaking out of the cup -pattern and essentially forgoing the development of a handle consolidation on the AAPL chart. But we're inclined to think that's not going to happen.In our view, an overbought stochastic and lack of an immediate catalyst for AAPL shares following a strong run will likely lead to a failed attempt at breaking out or simply a bit of price consolidation to neutralize conditions before a successful move into higher ground.AAPL Stock Bullish StrategyLooking at the Apple stock options board and given the discussed view, the Weeklys 3 March $129/$126 bull put spread is interesting.Priced for 50 cents, the seller of this put spread is able to collect the full credit as long as AAPL is above $129 at expiration three weeks from now. The margin of safety or downside buffer is roughly 2.3% with Apple stock trading near $132.05.If AAPL shares are above $129 at expiration, the collected credit amounts to a non-annualized return of 20%.In the event Apple stock falls and the vertical goes in-the-money, the trader can begin accumulating stock for no worse than a price of $128.50. Even better, the trader could possibly get a much lower effective purchase price if AAPL tanked through the spread.For instance, if AAPL were to fill the daily chart earnings gap and trade down to $121.50 in the next three weeks, through either assignment or closing the spread and simultaneously buying stock; the trader is at worst, out $2.50 or roughly 2% of Apple's share price.Ride the Energy Select Sector SPDR (ETF) (XLE) Higher With This TradeFactoring in the loss, if this trader wished to buy AAPL on the extreme weakness, the initial purchase price would net out to $124 ($121.50 AAPL + $2.50 vertical loss). That compares favorably to a trader purchasing AAPL today for $132 and a position that would be out 8.5% on paper.Bottom line, with income potential and the opportunity to purchase Apple stock with a margin of safety that includes stronger value and limited risk, this bullish AAPL put spread makes for a solid alternative to simply buying shares right now.Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in any of the securities or their derivatives mentioned in this article.

1 More Sign That Apple Inc.’s New MacBook Pro Computers Are a Huge Hit;2/9/2017;"Back in October of 2016,Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) released much-needed refreshes of its MacBook Pro   product line. Thanks to the launch of these new systems, Apple   broke the long losing streak that its Mac business had been   seeing, andreported1.1% year-over-year Mac unit growth, as well as roughly 7% Mac   revenue growth in its most recent quarter, implying a boost in   Mac average selling prices.Although the numbers clearly speak for themselves, there's one   more bit of information that Apple disclosed on its most recent   earnings call that points to positive customer reception of the   company's new MacBook Pro systems.Apple's newest MacBook Pro. Image source: Apple.makeArticleAd();Supply constraints curbed growthApple CEO Tim Cook said that that Apple was ""supply   constrained for the new MacBook Pro throughout the December   quarter and is just now coming into supply/demand balance"" for   the systems.Additionally, CFO Luca Maestri offered some commentary about   the company's Mac channel inventory dynamics, saying that the   company ""ended the quarter at the low end of [Apple's] four to   five week target range for Mac channel inventory.""Apple sells many different Mac products besides the MacBook   Pro with Touch Bar -- including the older discounted MacBook Pro   models, MacBook Air, 12-inch MacBook, and iMac -- so even though   Apple apparently ended the quarter within its target channel   inventory range, channel inventory levels of the new MacBook Pro   systems may have been at lower levels.What's next for the Mac?Apple has a reasonable shot of continuing to outperform the   broader personal computer market again, especially if it gets   back to putting out new/refreshed systems at a regular pace.Next up, I expect Apple to refresh its desktop systems. The   ones that Apple currently has for sale are now a generation   behind in processor technology, so at the very least, the company   ought to offer models with the latest chips.The performance boost from the new chips won't be   earth-shattering -- generation-on-generation improvements in   personal-computer performance are hardly dramatic these days --   but it's easier to market systems with the latest processors than   it is to try to market ones with previous-generation processors,   especially when the competition has moved to the newer ones.I also expect Apple to refresh the 12-inch MacBook system   soon. The current models use older processors, so at the very   least, a processor upgrade is in order. Once again, this is not   the sort of thing that's going to be fundamentally game changing,   but a better, faster system should be easier to sell.After those systems are updated, I expect Apple to go back and   update the MacBook Pro lineup again. I don't expect significant   changes like the ones the company brought with the ones launched   back in October 2016, but improved processor technology, and   perhaps a larger battery, could make for a ""good enough""   upgrade.Apple doesn't need to deliver ""revolutionary"" Mac products to   the market to do reasonably well -- the company's brand power,   its reputation for excellent customer support, and perhaps even   the strength of macOS relative to Windows, to some potential   buyers should be enough to allow the company to at least perform   with the market, if not steadily gain share.However, as we saw in the last year, if Apple doesn't   regularly refresh its product line, keeping it stale in an   already muted personal-computer market, then there will be less   incentive for current Mac owners to upgrade, and it will become   harder to convince Windows users to switch over.For the sake of Apple's Mac business, let's hope that the   company has plans for annual product refreshes to keep things   interesting.Offer from the Motley Fool: The 10 best stocks to buy       nowMotley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent     more than a decade beating the market.

Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Finally Fires Back at Apple With Android Wear 2.0;2/9/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAfter delaying the release for months,Alphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) finally launched Android Wear 2.0, the new version of its smartwatch operating system. Along with the new OS, which incorporates advanced features like Google Assistant, new Google smartwatch hardware was announced. Made in partnership withLG, the new devices are premium quality, made to take full advantage of Android Wear 2.0 and ready to take on the Apple Watch.makeArticleAd();Source: GoogleHere's what you need to know.Google knows it didn't exactly hit the ball out of the park when it first released its Android Wear smartwatch OS.Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) has dominated the smartwatch market since its release and despite an overall cooling for smartwatches in general, it looks as thoughApple Watch absolutely destroyed the competition over Christmas.That has to be especially galling to Google, considering the Apple Watch is only compatible with iPhones, while Android Wear smartwatches work with nearly 90% of the smartphones being sold today. And while Apple Watch remains locked into a clunky square watch face, Android Wear supports the traditional, round wristwatch look.Android Wear 2.0 Key FeaturesGoogle was originally supposed to release Android Wear 2.0 last September, but decided todelay it to this spring. Theofficial announcementlanded yesterday afternoon on GOOGL's blog.7 Tech Stocks That Are Bucking the DowntrendWhat did Google engineers spend the extra time working on? It appears that they had several major goals: improving on the basic features most smartwatch owners use (such as fitness tracking), cutting the cord to a smartphone with LTE support, and making Android Wear 2.0 smartwatches as compatible as possible with the iPhone.Key features Google is showing off include:Improved fitness tracking with Google Fit appLTE support for running apps and making voice calls directly from a smartwatch without requiring connection to a smartphoneGoogle Assistant is integratedCustomizable watch face componentsGoogle Play access direct from smartwatchSupport for hardware control similar to Apple Watch digital crownIn particular, the ability for more apps to run independently on Android Wear 2.0 devices - with no need to be connected to a smartwatch - means iPhone users will get almost the same experience as Android phone owners. Assuming GOOGL can convince them to skip the Apple Watch.New Google Smartwatch Is From LGRumors had been flying that alongside the new operating system, the first Google smartwatch would make an appearance. That made sense considering GOOGL's push into branded hardware with the Google Pixel Phone and devices like Google Home and Google WiFi.Xiaomi Was Going to Rival Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock -- What Happened?However, the two new smartwatches unveiled as part of the announcement are from LG, in collaboration with GOOGL.The LG Watch Style is a relatively basic model. It lacks advanced capabilities like GPS (or even a heart rate monitor), but delivers smartwatch features in a slim, traditional wristwatch form factor. The round display is a 1.2-inch OLED screen at 360 x 360 pixel resolution and the watch has all-day battery life. It comes with a leather strap and for an extra $30, a Rose Gold color option.The LG Watch Style is the bigger and more capable device, fully able to take full advantage of all Android Wear 2.0's new features. The 1.38-inch P-OLED display has a crisp 480 x 480 pixel resolution. The round frame is stainless steel, with IP68 water resistance. There's a heart rate monitor and GPS for fitness, Connectivity includes Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, LTE and NFC for Android Pay. Battery life is rated for all-day, but use of features like LTE and the heart rate monitor can significantly cut that.They're premium devices, designed to take on the Apple Watch and GOOGL's involvement means they make the most of Android Wear 2.0. But they aren't the official Google smartwatch … well see if that comes later.Availability and PricingGoogle says Android Wear 2.0 will begin rolling out ""in the coming weeks."" Most current Android Wear smartwatches should be eligible for the free update, but not all watches will support all features. The LG Watch Style and LG Watch Sport will retail for $249 and $349 respectively and will go on sale in the U.S. starting Feb. 10.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceApple Inc.

Why Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Target Was Upped Again;2/9/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsApple Inc.(AAPL) stock enjoyed healthy gains in the days following the company's earnings reports, and analystscrooned over the results.makeArticleAd();But not everyone was so thrilled, with some pointing out the fact that the December quarter had an extra week and others focusing on the challenges being seen in the smartphone market.Nonetheless, analysts are as happy as can be and continue to try to sell investors on the iPhone 8 cycle. At least one analyst has boosted his price target for AAPL stock based on the record iPhone unit number in the December quarter.AAPL Stock Target: $154 Per ShareCanaccord Genuityanalyst T. Michael Walkley raised his price target for Apple stock by more than $10 per share, from $142 to $154 per share in a research note dated Feb. 6. He feels the company took a ""strong share"" of the premium end of the world's smartphone market during the December quarter, as it generated 92% of profits.That is a decline from 106% of the profits in the September quarter, however, becauseSAMSUNG ELECTRONIC's (SSNLF) profits improved after the Galaxy Note 7 recall.Apple sold 78.3 million iPhones with an average selling price of $695 during its first fiscal quarter as consumers preferred the more expensive iPhone 7 Plus models. Walkley also believes the iPhone maker benefited from the Note 7 recall-although there was some debate about that before the results were released. Apple management said the quarter had the highest quarterly number of switchers from Android, something that third-party data indicated just before the release.The analyst also expects the iPhone 7 lineup to continue doing well, bridging the gap until the iPhone 8 is released, probably in September.Despite Walkley's (and almost everyone else's) enthusiasm about Apple stock, Neil George, a contributor forThe Street,feels investors are doing nothing more but attending the ""church of Apple.""Here's How Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Can Hit $200InvestorsdumpedAmazon.con, Inc.(AMZN) stock immediately following the retailer's earnings results (although the shares are up today), but they have been happily slurping up Apple stock.He said the iPhone maker ""is faced with a dwindling market share and shrinking margins,"" which means it just doesn't make sense to be so enamored with the company.Meanwhile, Amazon recorded soaring revenues and the seventh consecutive profitable quarter. There's also new data from Slice Intelligence indicating that the company hoards 53% of all growth in U.S. online sales.Did Apple Take Investors For a Ride?George argues that Apple ""pulled off a sleight of hand"" by adding the extra week in the December quarter-an argument also made by Thomas H. Kee Jr. onMarketWatch. According to Kee, to make up for that extra week, the company would have had to report about $3.53 per share in earnings rather than the $3.38 per share it reported.He also estimates that revenue should have been about $81 billion rather than the $78.4 billion that was reported. Based on his weekly calculations, the company grew at a 4.11% slower rate in the most recent December quarter than it did in the same quarter in 2015. Kee argued that Apple's growth rate contracted rather than grew in the most recently completed quarter and that it only looks like it did because of that extra week.George highlighted other ""problems"" he sees at Apple as well, like the contracted gross margin, which fell to 38.5% from 40.1% in the year-ago period. The iPhone maker also saw its sales in China, the world's biggest market, fall 12% in the December quarter, reducing its market share there to 9.6%. He said the company's global market share has fallen as well, down to 11.5%.Apple  is widely expected to launch the tenth anniversary edition of its smartphone under the iPhone 8 moniker, and most firms have been calling this cycle a ""supercycle"" because they're expecting tremendous growth.However, one analyst that's been calling for a supercycle is starting to back off from that theory and suggests now that the next cycle will be one of ""smooth"" growth rather than anything of the ""super"" variety.7 Tech Stocks With Explosive Growth PotentialUBSanalyst Steven Milunovich said in a research note dated Feb. 7 that he's now ""smoothing"" out his assumptions for iPhone growth over the next couple of years and adopting ""less of asupercycleview"" for fiscal 2018."" He noted that it should be expected for product cycles in a maturing market to become muted, so he's cutting his iPhone unit growth estimate from 16% to 12% for fiscal 2018 and boosting his fiscal 2019 estimate from a 2% decline to a 7% increase.Despite this smoothing out, he's still expecting the iPhone 8 cycle to bring greater growth than the fiscal 2019 cycle.He feels that it could be more beneficial for Apple stock's multiple if the company experiences more gradual growth because investors might be encouraged to see the company's hardware and services revenue combined as an annuity.Shares of AAPLstock rose by as much as 0.19% to $131.78 during regular trading hours on Wednesday and are trading slightly higher in early morning trading Thursday.The postApple Inc.

Apple’s Earnings Beat Was Driven By Broad-Based Execution;2/9/2017;"Apple's(NASDAQ: AAPL)  strong earnings beat on January 31 was   driven by strong performance across numerous business segments.   In this segment fromIndustry Focus: Tech, Motley Fool analysts Dylan Lewis and Evan Niu, CFA discuss the   headline numbers and other areas where the company executed   well.A full transcript follows the video.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run     for over a decade,Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has tripled the market.*makeArticleAd();David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy right now... and Apple wasn't one of them!     That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better     buys.Click hereto learn about these picks!*Stock Advisor returns as of February 6, 2017This podcast was recorded on Feb. 3, 2017.Dylan Lewis:I doubt that you could possibly be doing as well as Apple is   doing this week, though.Evan Niu:[laughs] That's true.Lewis:It's not too often that you see the world's largest   company spike 6% after earnings.Niu:Yeah. The numbers they put up, I mean, I was   pretty impressed. I wasn't really expecting them to blow it out   like this, and beat their own guidance by $400 million.Lewis:Yeah. We always do the Apple earnings show, it's one   of my favorites to do. But after several in a row where we've   been, like, ""Yeah, we know that growth is slow or even   declining, but just be patient, we think it's going to be   OK,"" it will be nice to do a show where we can talk   about them and have a bit of a rosier outlook on things,   and maybe reaffirm some of the confidence that the   Street should have in the business. In a lot of   ways, it's still a fantastic company. Why don't we start out   with a big numbers here? Revenue came in at $78.3 billion,   which beat estimates of $77.3 billion. Also beat the company's   guidance, like you said, by a couple hundred million.   Earnings per share came in at $3.36 for the quarter,   which also beat estimates of $3.22. So, for the first time   since fiscal Q1 of last year, the company posted   year-over-year revenue growth.Niu:Yeah. I think that's one of the big stories. 2016 was   so tough on them in terms of storylines and sentiment,   because, yeah, first year ever of showing negative growth,   and everyone is kind of gloomy about it. Then, they come   back and say, ""We still have it in us, we can still set   records, we can still push all these different parts of the   business to these completely record levels,"" including the   Mac, which is crazy, because the Mac has been around for 40   years, and they're still continuing to grow it and push up   higher.Lewis:And they've been working against so many   headwinds for such a long time in that year. You look   at the strong dollar having a pretty sizable impact on the   money they make overseas, and also the selling price of   devices overseas. You look at the elongating of the upgrade   cycle, particularly with some of the wireless   carriers moving away from a subsidy model, and getting   people off of that two-year upgrade.So, there are just a lot of things pushing against what   would normally cause people to be buying phones, or would   be allowing them to recognize more in revenue and earnings   here in the U.S. So, it's nice to see them bring it back up   this quarter.Dylan Lewisowns shares of Apple.Evan Niu, CFAowns shares of Apple.

Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Should Clobber Q4 Earnings, But …;2/9/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsChip firmNvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA) plans to release its fourth-quarter and full-year results to the investment community after the bell on Thursday, Feb. 9. In full disclosure, I've been slow to warm to Nvidia's investment appeal, and in the meantime, NVDA stock has nearly tripled.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockThe key to the forthcoming earnings release will be growth - just like it is for any company. So far, the earnings momentum and increases in analyst projections suggest Nvidia's prospects are bright.But will NVDA stock holders have to tolerate some bumps along the way?Nvidia Earnings ExpectationsIn mylast updateon Nvidia in early December, I suggested keeping an eye on earnings trends. At that time, full-year earnings estimates (the average of the earnings all analysts covering the name expect the company to report) had jumped nearly 32% - from $1.84 to $2.42 per share. It's a key reason NVDA stock has rallied so strongly.The current full-year estimate for Nvidia earnings (according to Yahoo Finance) is $2.41 per share. It relays that 19 analysts have provided estimates. That's about flat over the past 60 days, but actually down slightly from the $2.45 projected 30 days ago.But really, this is splitting hairs. It's very likely NVDA reports a solid quarter in terms of bottom-line growth.7 High-Risk, High-Reward Stocks to Buy NowAnd sales growth is projected to bestellar. Analysts expect at least a 36% annual bump to $6.84 billion. Next year, top-line growth is projected to slow to 16% for full-year sales of nearly $8 billion; 2018 profits are currently pegged at $2.71 per share.The Business Case for NVDA StockWith a current share price of $117.40, the forward price-to-earnings ratio on NVDA stock sits right below 50. That's a rather lofty multiple, and it essentially means that Nvidiamustgrow rapidly. Otherwise, that quickly surging share price could take a similarly speedy tumble.Fortunately, Nvidia operates in some of the most exciting growth areas for semiconductors. The company is best-known for graphic chips, and in particular its graphic processing units, or GPUs. The company boasts it is the ""world leader"" in visual computing. This looks accurate - a recentBarron'sarticlepegged its GPU market share at 68%. This is one of the most compelling spaces in the semiconductor industry.Nvidia's chips are an integral component in the ecosystems that are pioneering growth in virtual reality, cloud computing, machine learning, and self-driving cars. These are some hugely disruptive industries that could end up revolutionizing many facets of the gaming, computing, and automotive industries.The company's gaming business is the largest operating unit and growing 30% per year on average since 2013. Its data center business (to support cloud computing) is expanding at a more rapid clip - 40% annually. And automotive is skyrocketing 75% annually, though from a very small initial base.In some respects, and provided you are comfortable with the lofty valuation, Nvidia is a very compelling way for broad exposure to multiple disruptive industries.NVDA adds exposure to the cloud-computing excitement that is creating a buzz at giant tech firms includingAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN),Microsoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) andAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL).Tesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) is in the pole position in the autonomous automobile charge. The Nvidia Drive PX 2 computing platform currently powers the Tesla auto models that already have self-driving capabilities.The CompetitionMore direct competitors includeIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) andAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMD), both of which are looking to grow in these newer markets. Both key rivals are also likely to benefit from GPUs used to power gaming systems, machine learning, and servers used for cloud computing.Intel is somewhat hamstrung from its dominant market share in personal computing. Its 80% market share to power personal computers and related devices has literally resulted in hundreds of billions of dollars in cash flow over the past several decades. This gives it unmatched rivalry to invest in new technology and keep a leadership position over chip competitors. But computing is mature and barely expanding.Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Socks the Shorts With the Model 3AMD had been thought to have lost its way. Years of mismanagement allowed Intel to expand on its dominance and nearly put AMD out of business. But new management appears to have reinvigorated AMD, and investors are starting to believe it can also benefit from the same markets Nvidia is pursuing.Bottom Line on NVDA StockIn arecent interview, market strategist Ed Yardeni pegged semiconductor stocks as one of his favorite industries for 2017. In his words, ""we're talking about major secular disruptions in autos, consumer electronics, and gaming."" Chips that power data warehouses to serve the rise in cloud computing represent yet another market for these firms.NVDA stock is an investor's best bet to gain exposure to these markets. The rub, of course, is its valuation already reflects many more years of rapid growth.AMD is an interesting turnaround play, though with its current low levels of profitability, the trading multiples are also lofty. Intel is a much safer bet in the microchip space. Its forward P/E is below 15, and there is a modest dividend yield of 2.86% that should grow over time.I suggest taking a wait-and-see approach to Nvidia earnings. The fourth quarter is likely to impress, but given the lofty valuation, any hiccup in the expectations could result in a fair amount of share price volatility.As of this writing, Ryan Fuhrmann did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceGo Long Bank of America Corp (BAC) Stock For FreeReport: Apple Inc. iPhone 8 Could Cost More Than $1,000 (AAPL)The 10 Best Index Funds for 2017, 2018, 2019 ...The postNvidia Corporation (NVDA) Should Clobber Q4 Earnings, But …appeared first onInvestorPlace."

Report: Apple Inc. iPhone 8 Could Cost More Than $1,000 (AAPL);2/9/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsEveryone knows thatApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) is looking to leverage the 10th anniversary of the iPhone to boost sales. The smartphone market is maturing, and last quarter's record iPhone numbers were the first positive news in a while. For 2017, the company wants its new iPhone to make a huge splash and have people camping outside its stores waiting for one.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');Source: AppleBut no matter how cool AAPL makes the iPhone 8, would people pay $1,000 or more for one?iPhone 8 RumorsOver the past several months, rumors have been building that AAPL is going all-out with the iPhone 8. After three years of looking essentially identical - good luck telling an iPhone 6 from an iPhone 7 without actually powering it up - the iPhone 8 is going to look different.Justhowdifferent is where the rumor mill comes in.However, the money is on Apple dropping the aluminum back in favor of anall-glass design. Making the new iPhone pop even more is the expectation of an OLED display that ditches the bezels and even the Home button.A new iPhone that looks completely different from the models of the previous three years is expected to boost sales as Apple fans trade in their old phones. There also has been speculation that AAPL will take advantage of the 10th anniversary to charge a premium for the iPhone 8.But a new report suggests that could be higher than expected.Is the Market Ready for a $1,000-Plus iPhone?Fast Companyreports that AAPL isn't just looking to boost sales with the iPhone 8,it's looking to cash in on upgrade fever.The 7 Most Popular Vanguard Funds for 401k PlansCiting a source with ""knowledge of Apple's plans,""Fast Companysays the 10th anniversary iPhone 8 will indeed be the all-glass design (with a stainless steel band) and OLED display. At 5.8 inches, it will be larger than the iPhone 7 Plus. It may even have a cooler name than iPhone 8: ""iPhone X"" is being thrown around.And according toFast Company'ssource,it will likely start at over $1,000.In comparison, previous iPhones have traditionally had a $649 starting price. When the Plus models were introduced, AAPL started those bigger iPhones at $749, boosting that to $769 for the iPhone 7 Plus.Can Apple Pull Off Such an Expensive iPhone 8?There's no question that $1,000-plus is averyexpensive smartphone. That's basically $250 more than AAPL has ever charged.EvenSamsung Electronics Co Ltd(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) only hit $849 with its flagship (and doomed) Galaxy Note 7. That phablet has a great deal in common with the iPhone 8's expected features, including an oversized OLED display and wireless charging.However, Apple is undoubtedly emboldened by the success of its more expensive Plus phone in the last quarter. Despite carrying a premium (and the iPhone 7 Plus price hike), in the previous quarter, sales surged for the larger, more expensive iPhones. The iPhone 7 Plus is estimated to have accounted for40% of iPhone 7 sales worldwide- double the share of the iPhone 6 Plus.Fast Company'ssource says Apple will also offer the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus in 2017. That positions the iPhone 8 - or iPhone X - as a true premium offering. Anyone who wants a new iPhone would still have the option of buying the standard offerings (which would continue to be among the best smartphones on the market).Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Socks the Shorts With the Model 3But for those with deeper pockets who truly want to make a statement, then the $1,000-plus 10th anniversary iPhone 8 will be there.It's a risky strategy, but it could pay off big-time for Apple.As usual, this early in the year, speculation about AAPL's new iPhone plans is just that - speculation. So stay tuned as more details leak and we get a closer to a definitive picture of what the company is up to for fall 2017.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceApple Inc.

Thursday’s Vital Data: Apple Inc. (AAPL), Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD) and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD);2/9/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsU.S. stock futures are headed higher this morning, as Wall Street weights its options ahead of the latest round of corporate earnings and a smattering of economic data. Among today's earnings headliners areTwitter Inc(NYSE:TWTR),The Coca-Cola Co(NYSE:KO) andNvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA), while weekly jobless claims and wholesale inventories round out the economic reports.makeArticleAd();At last check, futures on theDow Jones Industrial Averagewere up 0.16%, withS&P 500futures rising 0.16% andNasdaq-100futures up 0.1%.On the options front, volume surged to well above average on Wednesday, driven mostly byApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) call traders looking to capture roughly $3.1 billion in dividends. Overall, about 16.9 million calls and 12.7 million puts changed hands yesterday. Over on the CBOE, the single-session equity put/call volume ratio slipped to 0.69, though the 10-day moving average ticked higher once again to yet another three-month high at 0.71.Turning to Wednesday's volume leaders, Apple call traders scrambled to get a chunk of the roughly $3.1 billion in dividends the company will be paying out on Feb. 16, to  those who were shareholders as of yesterday. Meanwhile,Gilead Sciences, Inc.(NASDAQ:GILD) retreated on mixed options volume as guidance for its hepatitis C treatment was lower than expected, andAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMD) was bolstered by supportive comments from BMO Capital.Apple Inc. (AAPL)In a frenzy that pushed Wednesday's total overall options volume well above the daily average, Apple call traders flooded the stock with in-the-money Feb contracts. Total volume rocketed to a near-term high of more than 4.2 million contracts, with calls gobbling up 88% of the day's take.7 High-Risk, High-Reward Stocks to Buy NowThe most popular strikes were the Feb $125 and Feb $120 calls, whereTrade-Alert.comnotes that a plethora of 12,000 and 13,500 contract blocks traded late in yesterday's session.For traders who managed to gain control of AAPL stock shares by the close last night,Apple is paying out 57 cents per share on Feb. 16- for a rough total of about $3.1 billion to all shareholders of record.Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD)Bright and early yesterday morning,Gilead posted a fourth-quarter profitof $2.70 per share on revenue of $3.1 billion. While both figures were down year-over-year, Gilead managed to beat Wall Street's expectations for the quarter. Guidance, however, was another matter.It seems that Gilead's blockbuster hepatitis C drug was considerably more effective than expected, all but curing the disease and lowering expectations for sales in 2017. Going forward, Gilead expects to sell between $7.5 billion and $9 billion worth of hep-C treatments, far below Wall Street's expectations for $12 billion.Options traders were torn on GILD stock's reaction. Volume tagged over 554,000 contracts, with calls eking out 53% of the day's take. Still, with GILD plunging more than 8.6% yesterday, the shares are now trading well below all major call accumulations in the Feb series, while the roughly 19,000 puts at the Feb $70 strike are trading nearly four-points in the money.With GILD at its lowest point since 2014, some of yesterday's call action may have been bargain hunting in a bid for an oversold bounce for the shares.Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD)WhenBMO Capital commented on PC and laptop salesfor January and February, it wasn't exactly the most bullish of outlooks. Sales were slightly lower than expected in January and February's outlook was similar, with the Chinese New Year affecting demand. However, BMO said that its ""outperform"" rating for AMD wouldn't be affected, and the uptick in demand following the Chinese New Year may actually help AMD.Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Socks the Shorts With the Model 3With the shares riding high following rumors of anIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC)licensing deal, it was all the nudge AMD bulls needed to double down on call options. Volume on Wednesday remained strong at 355,000 contracts, while calls snapped up 70% of the day's take.AMD is now trading well north of most major call accumulations in the Feb series, with only the roughly 8,000 contracts at the $14 strike remaining in its way. Meanwhile, most options traders have narrowed their focus to the Feb $13.50 strike, especially put traders, with about 10,000 of these bearish bets now residing at the strike.As of this writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace12 Stocks That Will Live and Die by Donald Trump's Pen9 Best Cheap Stocks to Buy Now Under $9.99The postThursday's Vital Data: Apple Inc.

Apple, Inc.'s Stock's 40% Comeback -- What Investors Should Know;2/9/2017;"Over the past 12 months,Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) stock has absolutely trounced the S&P 500,   surging 40.4%, from just under $95 per share to about $132 at the   time of this writing. This rise compares with the S&P 500's   22% gain during the same period. Interestingly, the performance   of Apple's business during this period hasn't been particularly   impressive. So, what drove the stock higher?Boring resultsIn Apple's most recently reported trailing-12-month period,   results actually look quite dismal. During this period, revenue   fell 7% and earnings per share tumbled an even steeper 11.3%. YetApple stocksurged higher.Image source: Apple.makeArticleAd();Sure, Apple's financial results have turned upward recently,   with the tech giant reporting 3.3% and 9.6% year-over-year   increases in revenue and EPS for the company's most recently   reported quarter. But this is just one quarter. Further, these   aren't the sort of results often associated with 40% rises in a   stock price -- especially when referring to a popular tech   company.But despite Apple's lackluster performance in the past 12   months, shares have climbed higher and easily outperformed the   market.Valuation mattersSo if Apple's business saw both revenue and EPS decline in the   past 12 reported months, why are shares trading higher? While   investors could come up with a range of reasons, one catalyst for   the stock during this period likely stands out the most: Apple   stock was undervalued.AAPL PE Ratio (TTM)data byYChartsOne year ago, Apple stock had a mind-boggling low   price-to-earnings ratio of just 10. For context, the average P/E   of stocks in the S&P 500 at the time was 21.4, more than   double Apple's. Combining this dirt-cheap valuation with Apple's   dividend, its sizable repurchase program, and the company's long   history of successful products, itwas clearthat the Street had oversold Apple stock as the market worried   about the company's ability to continue growing its business.Sure, Apple's stock probably didn't justify the same 20 P/E   its peers in the S&P 500 averaged, but the stockalmost certainlydidn'tdeserveto trade at a P/E of 10.What's next for Apple stock?Going forward, can Apple stock continue soaring? While Apple's   higher price-to-earnings ratio today of nearly 16 does a better   job of pricing in a more optimistic outlook for the company,   investors should keep in mind that the stock's 40% rise during   the past 12 months doesn't automatically make Apple stock   expensive today. Indeed, the stock is arguably still a buy.For Apple to live up to its valuation today, the company will   need to return to more consistent revenue growth and maintain   pricing power -- two outcomes that shouldn't be a problem for the   company. Yes, revenue and EPS are down in the trailing 12 months,   but Apple'sreturn to growthrecently, it'sfast-growing services segment, andconsistently strong pricing power, all point to a bright future for Apple's business -- and a   bright future for the underlying business when a stock is trading   at just 16 times earnings likely means the stock will perform   well, too.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Large Cap Growth ETF (SCHG) Hits New 52-Week High;2/9/2017;"For investors seeking momentum,Schwab U.S. Large-Cap Growth ETFSCHGis probably on radar now. The fund just hit a 52-week high and is up roughly 28.6% from its 52-week low price of $45.45/share.makeArticleAd();But are more gains in store for this ETF? Let's take a quick look at the fund and the near-term outlook on it to get a better idea on where it might be headed:SCHG in FocusSCHG provides exposure to the growth stocks of the large cap segment with key holdings in information technology, consumer discretionary, healthcare and industrials. However, it has a significant concentration on the top firm - AppleAAPL- at 6.9% while other firms hold less than 3.2% of assets. The product charges 4 basis points in fees (see:all the Large Cap ETFs here).Why the Move?The growth space of the broad U.S. stock market has been an area to watch lately given the stellar performance of the stocks and improving domestic fundamentals. Though Trump's protectionist and anti-trade policies are flaring up volatility, U.S. bourses are hitting new highs. In such a trending market (i.e. a market characterized by a prolonged uptrend), growth stocks tend to outperform. Additionally, solid manufacturing and industrial activities across the globe are providing a boost to these stocks.More Gains Ahead?Currently, SCHG has a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 or 'Hold' rating with a Medium risk outlook. Therefore, it is hard to get a handle on its future returns in one way or the other. However, many of the segments that make up this ETF have a strong Zacks Industry Rank, so there is definitely some promise for those who want to ride this surging ETF a little further.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks' free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.Get it free >>Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Why the Stock Market Under Trump Will Probably Lag the Market Under Obama;2/9/2017;"President Donald Trump's @POTUS Twitter feed sounded off in   celebration on Jan. 25 when theDow Jones Industrial Averagereached 20,000 for the first time ever, just five days   after his inauguration:Great!#Dow20Khttps://t.co/wXFhXBLgag-- President Trump (@POTUS)January 25, 2017In her own Tweet, former campaign manager and now presidential   advisor Kellyanne Conway credited ""The Trump Effect.""makeArticleAd();The administration was right to celebrate what has been a very   bullish market rally following the election results on Nov. 8.   The market reacted bearishly to the unexpected results on   election night, but ever since then, it's been on the rise.However, the Dow's 9%-plus rise since Election Day is just a   fraction of how much the stock market rose during President   Obama's eight-year tenure. It's very early in the Trump   administration, but can we predict whether the market will   perform better or worse under President Trump than under   President Obama?Image source: Getty Images.Timing mattersThe chart below shows how theDow Jones Industrial Averagehas performed during the terms of the last 10 presidents, all the   way back to when Lyndon Johnson took office in 1963 (the black   arrows mark the year in which each president was first   elected):Image source: MacroTrends.net, with presidents' names tied     to election dates added by author.

Data source:MacroTrends.net.Obama took office at the tail end of the Financial Crisis.   Even though the administration enacted policies that would   typically seem to limit the earnings ability of some corporations   within the Dow, such as stricter reporting regulations, the   market rose handily (in percentage terms) during his eight years   in office. Setting aside any economic policies the Obama   administration enacted, the fact that President Obama took office   near the market's trough meant that the market, which is cyclical   in nature, had a much stronger chance of rebounding during his   tenure.Meanwhile, Trump assumed the presidency after an   eight-year-long bull run that saw no sustained corrections.   History shows that corrections happen at somewhat regular   intervals, and many market analysts believe one is due soon.   Based on how market the cycle has worked through recent decades,   it seems unlikely that we'll see consistent growth during   President Trump's tenure -- but, of course, it's not   impossible.What business leaders are sayingMany business leaders have been speaking optimistically of   Trump's proposed financial policies in their earnings calls.Cisco Systems(NASDAQ: CSCO) CEO Chuck Robbins said during the company's fiscal   first-quarter earnings call in November, ""I think President-elect   Trump appears to be very business-oriented and is very focused on   driving the U.S. economy, and anytime the U.S. economy improves   that's certainly good for us.""Southwest Airlines(NYSE: LUV) is another company that is looking forward to lower   taxes and less regulation. In the most recent earnings call, CEO   Gary Kelly finished answering an analyst question about upcoming   policy changes by saying:""We've looked at the tax reform proposals and we're quite     excited about that on the corporate front, but that's just     about income tax. So that doesn't really speak to the very     heavy burden that we have for aviation taxes, which we also     want to take up with the administration. So, that's a long     answer to your question and I think the bottom line is: No, we     don't know anything specific yet, but we sure like what we're     hearing so far.""Of course, there's also rising concern among many CEOs and   other business leaders about how certain policies that have been   floated or initiated could negatively affect their businesses or   the broader economy. These include tariffs on imported goods and   the controversial executive order restricting travel to the   U.S.Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) management has said positive things about   potential tax cuts, especially those related to repatriating cash   kept overseas, of which Apple has around $200 billion. However,   Apple is also one of the biggest companies that in recent weeks   have come out against Trump's immigration policy. And it is one   of many companies taking legal action against Trump's immigration   stance, citing (along with moral opposition) concerns that it   could ultimately damage the company financially.How to invest during a Trump presidencyThe Dow Jones' average price-to-earnings ratio is currently   around 20 -- relatively high by historic standards. Additionally,   you can probably expect politics, and the market's reaction to   them, to be volatile in the months and years ahead. Nonetheless,   that shouldn't scare away investors. As the investing proverb   goes: Time in the market is more important than timing the   market.Regardless of how you believe the stock market will perform   based on cyclicalty or political volatility -- barring a massive   shift in policy that derails corporate earnings ability, or a   major economic disaster resulting from an environmental, social,   or defense crisis -- you should note that the market performance   graph above has marched upward over the long term.As a long-term investor, you should continue to look for   valuable investments to buy and hold while also watching the   economic and political climate closely. And whatever you do,   remember that your investment horizon should be greater than four   -- or even eight -- years.10 stocks we like better than Wal-MartWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock     tip, it can pay to listen.

Boeing Co (BA) Stock Gives Savvy Investors a Good Payout;2/9/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsDon't let a faulty altimeter lead you to believeBoeing Co(NYSE:BA) is in need of repair. Any stray measurements in Boeing stock's share price on Wednesday were tied to a pending dividend payment - and one that has already paid nice dividends to some options traders. Let me explain.makeArticleAd();Source:Phillip Capper via FlickrShares of Boeing have been flying high in 2017 after hitting record highs following the aircraft manufacturer's earnings beat late last month. But in Wednesday's session, BA stock may have appeared to have had a slight crack in its fuselage; pardon the pun.Houston, Boeing Has a Problem?At a share price of $164.08 and depending on your trading vendor, BA stock was off either $1 or 0.61% or a more eyebrow raising -$2.42 or -1.45%.The $1.42 difference between the two readings in Boeing shares is tied to the stock going ex-dividend Wednesday, with a cash payment of $1.42 scheduled for March 3.Bearing this in mind, trade vendors who recognize the ex-date will show BA stock as trading lower by the less-significant 0.61%. Any chart or quote platforms that erroneously fail to account for the ex-date will indicate Boeing has declined by a larger 1.45%.For BA stock investors who were long or purchased shares by Tuesday's close, Wednesday's minor damage is reflected by the more modest 0.61% dip, as $1.42 will be paid back to shareholders next month to dampen the otherwise larger 1.45% decline in Boeing.7 Stocks That Will Drop by 10% or More This QuarterWhat's the point? Dividends aren't a free lunch, as the money distributed is taken out of the share price of the stock. If Wednesday wasn't an ex-date in Boeing, BA stock would be trading $1.42 higher at $165.50 vs. $164.08 - bottom-line.For the proverbial free lunch, you'd have to look at Tuesday's heavy volume options trading in BA stock tied to 'dividend play' activity, which looks to arbitrage the future payout with an immediate overnight payoff.BA Stock Dividend Play StrategyTo illustrate how this might be accomplished, we can look at the BA stock Feb $155 call, as roughly $14,200 in profits was distributed to one or more options traders today due to the ex-dividend.In Tuesday's session, more than 5,600 of the deep in-the-money calls traded. The heavy tally compares to open interest at the time of roughly 2,500. With the February $155 put trading for 10 cents, part of the unusual volume may have been in the form of traders executing buy-writes or the equivalent of a synthetic short put.But the traders responsible for this activity weren't looking to establish buy-writes for 10 cents when buying BA stock and selling the February $155 call during Tuesday's session. Nope.What these BA stock dividend traders were really after was hoping a long $155 call holder within the pool of existing open interest of 2,500 failed to exercise the contract last night. If that were to occur, those traders would in effect, have shorted (synthetically) the February $155 put worth a measly 10 cents for a much more meaningful $1.42 for each buy-write still in inventory.How it works is Tuesday's dividend play traders would effectively wash on their BA stock position as the decline in share price attributed to the ex-date will be paid next month. The profit generator in this transaction is the short call portion of the buy-write, which wasn't assigned.Call options don't receive dividends, so a contract like the deep $155 call essentially loses the full value of the pending dividend. It's why an investor holding this contract would be greatly motivated to exercise the call and convert the position into BA stock before the ex-dividend.Apple Inc. (AAPL) Is No Longer Top Dog in ChinaAs it stands, of the 2,500 in open interest roughly 2,400 call holders did elect to exercise their call into BA stock last night in order to receive the upcoming dividend. We know this based on Wednesday's open interest just shy of 100 contracts.We also know that because of the failure of those contracts to convert, one or more traders short the call - and maybe part of a buy-write positioning described; already profited to the collective tune of around $14,200.Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in any of the securities or their derivatives mentioned in this article.

Why Fitbit Inc (FIT) Needs to Wise Up Before It Can Win Again;2/9/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFitbit Inc(NYSE:FIT) may be great to improve your health, but as for Fitbit stock, it has been lethal for investors. During the last 12 months, FIT stock is off a horrendous 60%. This is certainly another case study of how high-profile IPOs can quickly come undone.makeArticleAd();Source:Via FitbitBut what about the future? Is there hope for Fitbit stock? Might there be a value play here?As I've written various times for InvestorPlace, it's probably not a good idea to be hopeful. For example, FIT is a company that develops a product that really is not a must-have. According to a recent study fromGartner, the abandonment rate on fitness trackers is 30%. The most common reasons for this include: users either get bored or the device breaks!The conclusion from the report: ""Dropout from device usage is a serious problem for the industry. The abandonment rate is quite high relative to the usage rate. To offer a compelling enough value proposition, the uses for wearable devices need to be distinct from what smartphones typically provide. Wearables makers need to engage users with incentives and gamification.""The Other Problems for FIT StockBut this is definitely not the only major issue with Fitbit stock. Let's face it, the competitive environment remains intense. The company must fight against tough rivals likeGarmin Ltd.(NASDAQ:GRMN),Samsung(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) andMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT). Although, the biggest threat isApple Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AAPL) Apple Watch, which is still in the early phases.7 Stocks That Will Drop by 10% or More This QuarterIn light of all this, is it any wonder that Wall Street is concerned with FIT stock? Of course not.More importantly, the company is already reporting major problems, as seen with the latest warning on fourth-quarter earnings. Fitbit's guidance calls for a loss of 51 cents to 56 cents a share on revenues of $572 million to $580 million. By comparison, the prior forecast was for earnings of 14 cents to 18 cents a share and revenues of $725 million to $750 million. Overall, it looks like the holiday season turned out to be a disaster for the company.Unfortunately, the bad situation isexpected to continue. The full-year prediction is for revenues of $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion and a loss of 22 cents to 44 cents a share on FIT stock. Wall Street, on the other hand, was looking for a much more robust $2.38 billion on the top-line and profits of 64 cents a share.Bottom Line on Fitbit StockTo deal with the challenges, FIT has a plan that looks weak. The company expects to reduce the workforce by mere 6% and to take other vague efforts to reduce operating costs, leverage data and launch products into new categories. Interesting enough, Fitbit wants to focus more on the smartwatch market, but this will likely mean more expenses.3 Reasons Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock Is STILL the KingEven worse, CEO James Parksaidthat the issues with the company were ""temporary"" and the ""performance is not reflective of the value of our brand, market-leading platform, and company's long-term potential.""Huh? Well, this really does seem like the talk of someone who is out-of-touch. And this should definitely be ominous for holders of FIT stock.Granted, perhaps there may be a buyout. But when it comes to broken hardware companies, this may be wishful thinking. For example, think about how long the rumors for a purchase of the beleagueredBlackBerry Ltd(NASDAQ:BBRY) have existed.For the most part, Fitbit stock may not be very interesting to a suitor. And this is not because the products are sub-par. Instead, it could be as simple as that the market has hit maturation levels and that big players like AAPL stand to capture a big part of what's available.Tom Taulli runs the InvestorPlace blogIPO Playbook.

Facebook vs. Apple: Whose Reality Will Win?;2/8/2017;"One of the most promising trends on the horizon that has   arguably the most transformative potential is virtual/augmented   reality (VR/AR). How these technologies emerge and subsequently   affect our lives remains to be seen, but companies are already   placing their bets accordingly.Facebook(NASDAQ: FB) became the poster child for VR in one fell swoop in   2014 when it scooped up Oculus for $2 billion. A week ago,   Facebook lost a lawsuit regarding the acquisition to ZeniMax,   which alleged that Oculus stole trade secrets, and a jury awarded   ZeniMax $500 million (ZeniMax was seeking $6 billion). Facebook   will appeal, but let's call the total effective cost of   acquisition $2.5 billion for now.Once upon a time,Alphabetwas the poster child for AR with Google Glass, but that product   failed spectacularly.Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) has emerged as a potential candidate to assume   that title, albeit unofficially until it actually unveils an AR   offering. We do know that CEO Tim Cook isfar more interestedin AR than VR, believing that it will have broader appeal with   mainstream use cases.makeArticleAd();It's still early innings, but whose vision of reality will   win?VR is harder and will take longerFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg firmly believes that VR will be   the next major computing platform that has the potential to be a   paradigm shift. But it's going to take an awful long time to get   there. VR is currently a nascent niche of video gaming, and it   requires creating entire worlds to immerse users in. That also   requires both a lot of software development as well as heavy   lifting on the technical side, requiring high-end gaming rigs   that cost $1,000 or more by themselves.Mark Zuckerberg speaking at Oculus Connect 2. Image source:     Facebook.His Zuckness sees VR as a richer media format that can create   a diverse array of social experiences. He's even envisioned a   distant future where you can visit a doctor in VR, or hang out   with long-distance friends in a VR room (like how hechatted with Hugo Barrabefore hiring the executive). It will take at least a decade, but   Facebook is in it for the long haul. Uncle Zuck is also   interested in AR, but it seems that he thinks AR will come after   VR, based on his comments from last year's F8 conference:Over the next 10 years, the form factor's just going to keep     on getting smaller and smaller. And eventually we're going to     have what looks like normal-looking glasses that can do both     virtual and augmented reality. And augmented reality gives you     the ability to see the world but also to be able to overlay     digital objects on top of that.Earlier today,Business Insiderreported that Facebook was shutting down hundreds of its Oculus   pop-up demonstration stations within big box retailers, noting   that employees would go days without giving a single   demonstration to interested customers. So yeah, it's going to be   a while until VR is ready for the mainstream.AR is easier and be here soonerAs usual, Apple isn't giving any official clues as to its   strategy, but there have been rumors of the company testing out   AR glasses and it has been hiring and acqui-hiring experts from   the field since at least 2015.It's much more plausible that AR will have a more immediate   impact. The software should be easier to develop and less   computationally intensive. Imagine the things you currently do on   your smartphone being beamed in front of you. Or you can even use   a smartphone as an AR interface, which many apps already do   today.But if Apple were to jump in directly with AR integration in   iOS and/or a set of AR glasses, that would have the potential to   truly bring AR to the masses, much like the company's track   record with bringing many other previously niche technologies to   the mainstream. It's also a lot more approachable to the   average user.Here's another quote from Cook regarding AR from   September:My own view is that augmented reality is the larger of the     two, probably by far, because this gives the capability for     both of us to sit and be very present talking to each other,     but also have other things visually for both of us to see.     Maybe it's something we're talking about, maybe it's someone     else here that is not here, present, but could be made to     appear to be present with us. So there's a lot of really cool     things there.Cook's point is that VR can be isolating since you have to   wear a large obtrusive headset, which is a bit ironic given that   Facebook is so interested in a potentially anti-social experience   (at least anti-social in physical reality).I'm going to side with Apple here and agree that AR has much   more potential than VR.10 stocks we like better than FacebookWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Better Buy: Apple Inc. vs. IBM;2/8/2017;"Shares ofApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) andInternational Business Machines(NYSE: IBM) have performed well over the past year, both up about   40% following periods of underperformance. Apple, after reporting   three consecutive quarters of sales declines, finally broke out   of its funk last month when it reported solid,albeit muddled, holiday quarter results. IBM, after years of earnings declines,   expects to return to growth on a per-share basis this year.Both stocks are cheap relative to earnings, but I think IBM is   the better buy. Here's why.Apple is cheap, but growth will be toughShares of Apple trade around their all-time high following the   company's fiscal first-quarter report, but the stock is still   cheap relative to earnings. Apple produced $45.2 billion of net   income over the past 12 months, or $8.39 per share. With a stock   price around $131, that puts Apple's PE ratio at roughly   15.6.makeArticleAd();Image source: Apple.But this calculation ignores the immense amount of cash on   Apple's balance sheet. At the end of the first quarter, Apple had   $246 billion of cash and investments and $77 billion of debt,   leaving a net cash position of $169 billion. Valued fully and   backed out, Apple's cash-adjusted PE ratio falls to just   11.5.Apple stockisn't nearly as cheap as it was a year ago, but the market is   still pricing in minimal future growth even at all-time highs.   There are good reasons for this. Apple remains highly dependent   on the iPhone, which accounted for nearly 70% of revenue during   the first quarter. With the smartphone market no longer growing   quickly, consumers taking longer to upgrade, and mid-range   devices getting better and cheaper, consistent iPhone growth   going forward is going to be tough to achieve.And even though Apple managed to grow iPhone sales and EPS   during the first quarter, net income declined due to a lower   gross margin and higher operating expenses. Share buybacks were   the sole source of per-share earnings growth.Apple is going to need to come up with something big in order   to grow earnings meaningfully in the coming years, but it's   unclear whether Apple will be able to come up with the next big   thing. Services revenue has been growing quickly for Apple,   but the jury is still out on whether this will be enough to drive   earnings higher.IBM's transformation makes progressIBM stock is also cheap, despite the rally over the past year.   The company produced $13.59 in adjusted EPS during 2016, putting   the P/E ratio at 13. IBM's earnings have been in decline for a   few years, and its revenue has been slumping since 2012. But its   multiyear transformation is making progress, and the company   expects to produce at least $13.80 in adjusted EPS this year.Image source: IBM.IBM has been divesting and shifting resources away from   shrinking legacy businesses, pouring money into growth   initiatives like cloud computing. This shift, while painful, is   now starting to bear fruit. IBM's strategic imperatives -- what   the company calls its various growth businesses -- now account   for 41% of total revenue after growing by 13% in 2016.The cloud-computing business is booming. Total cloud revenue   reached $13.7 billion in 2016, up 35%. Cloud delivered as a   service, which includes only infrastructure as a service,   platform as a service, and software as a service, is at an annual   revenue run rate of $8.6 billion, up 61% year over year. IBM's   ongoing shift to subscription software has hurt overall software   sales in the past couple of years, but thesoftware business has now posted growthfor three straight quarters.IBM's earnings have room to grow simply because the bottom   line has been beaten down so much over the past few years. As IBM   continues to remake itself as a cloud and cognitive computing   company, a return to consistent earnings growth is a real   possibility.IBM is the better betWhile I don't necessarily think that Apple is a bad   investment, I find it difficult to believe that the company will   be able to grow earnings from here. The iPhone is going to have   to hold up in a world where good phones are getting cheaper, and   the company is going to have to come up with something new and   innovative that can move the needle.IBM, on the other hand, has a much broader business, with a   vast customer base dependent on its products and services.   Earnings have room to grow substantially as the strategic   imperatives, which are more software-heavy than the company as a   whole, continue to expand. Given similar valuations, I'll take   IBM any day.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Would You Buy a $1,000 iPhone?;2/8/2017;"This year is a momentous one forApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) because it marks the iPhone's 10th year. That's   ratcheting up expectations for what the company may have up its   sleeve, especially since 2016's iPhone 7 and 7 Plus only received   incremental updates within the same overall design (not like that   hurt sales at all).The most recent speculation comes fromFast Company, which is reporting that the 10th-generation iPhone might   incredibly be priced at $1,000 or more. That would be even higher   than $969 that it costs to buy a fully loaded iPhone 7 Plus with   256 GB of storage. As previously rumored (and widely expected at   this point), at least one variant may include an OLED display.   OLED displays don't come cheap, and the one that Apple is   thinking about using will probably cost about twice as much as   traditional LCD displays. Historically, the entire display   assembly often comprises about 40% of component costs, so a   potential price increase makes perfect sense to offset a cost   increase related to the most expensive component.Jet Black iPhone 7 Plus. Image source: Apple.makeArticleAd();Apple is reportedly still considering removing the physical   home button and potentially even the volume and lock buttons on   the sides, all of which would join the headphone jack in iHeaven.   The iPhone maker is collaborating withLumentum(NASDAQ: LITE) , whose shares were alreadypoppingafter earnings, to develop a 3D sensing technology that could be   used for facial recognition and other applications. RivalSamsungstarted introducing facial recognition features in its flagship   phones years ago.Think differentThe company is hoping to pack as many new features into the   high-end model as possible, which would help justify a four-digit   price tag. Apple has long enjoyed the strongest pricing power   within the smartphone industry, and this would potentially   represent the strongest exhibit of Apple flexing its pricing   muscles.Data source: SEC filings. Chart by author. Calendar quarters     shown.If Apple can pull it off, a $1,000 price tag would clearly   boost average selling prices, the degree of which would depend on   product mix. Samsung has attempted to launch $1,000-plus phones   in the past, like 2013's horribly named Galaxy Round which   featured a curved AMOLED display that was responsible for the   higher price. But Samsung's error was believing that the curved   display itself would justify the premium to consumers, even   though the device was largely similar to other Galaxy phones at   the time in other respects. Apple's task, then, will be to   include enough differentiating factors in the $1,000 model to set   it apart.In recent years, carriers have shifted away from the subsidy   model and toward installment and leasing plans. At first,   consumers were hit with sticker shock that premium smartphones   cost over $600, as opposed to the subsidized $200 they had   previously been paying, but it's safe to say that at this point   consumers fully appreciate how much smartphones actually cost.   The increased pricing transparency associated with abandoning   subsidies indirectly helps lay the foundation for innovation,   because manufacturers can then appeal directly to consumers on   why a higher price tag is warranted by new features instead of   having to negotiate subsidy levels with carriers. The extra $20   bump associated with the iPhone 7 Plus dual-camera system is a   good example.Would you buy a $1,000 iPhone?10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Close Update: Dow Closes Lower As Falling Yields Continue to Weigh on Bank Stocks;2/8/2017;"The benchmark averages were mixed at Wednesday's close with the financial sector weighing on the Dow, but strength in tech shares driving the Nasdaq just shy of another record high. The S&P 500 closed fractionally higher on gains in the defensive and consumer sectors.Banking stocks have been underwater since the start of the week, plagued by lower Treasury yields as investors sought safe havens from the political environment in France and backlash from President Donald Trump's recent executive orders.And although yields were briefly tugged higher in the wake of today's disappointing 10-year auction, the 10-year yield has dropped nearly 9 basis points since last week. As a result shares of Dow component stocks Goldman Sachs (GS) and JP Morgan (JPM) led decliners again on Wednesday, offsetting gains in Apple (AAPL) and Nike (NKE).makeArticleAd();Earnings were also creating a drag on Wall Street Wednesday as Wall Street geared up for the final leg of fourth quarter results. Of the companies that reported Tuesday more than half beat EPS estimates, but less than half topped revenue expectations. Additionally, component stock Disney beat EPS estimates by a nickel, but missed revenue guidance by nearly half a billion dollars.The earnings onslaught continues Thursday with Twitter (TWTR), Yum Brands (YUM), Dunkin Brands (DNKN), and Reynolds American (RAI) among the big names reporting before the open. Economic data includes initial jobless claims and wholesale inventories and sales, with St Louis Fed President James Bullard and Chicago Fed President Charles Evans scheduled to speak.

Is Apple Inc. on the Verge of Cracking This Fast-Growing Market?;2/8/2017;"Image source: Apple.Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is growing at a fast pace in India. The company   sold 2.5 million iPhones in the South Asian country in 2016, an   increase of almost 39% from estimated sales of 1.8 million units   the year before. Despite this impressive growth, India remains   just a small part of Apple's overall business.makeArticleAd();When compared to estimated global iPhone sales of around 234   million units for 2016, India makes up just over 1% of that   volume. This does not paint a very nice picture for the company   in a smartphone market that's currently growing at 18% compared   to the global average of just 3%.The reason for Apple's underperformance in India is quite   simple -- high prices in a country with low per capita income.   Consider this: India's GDP per capita in 2015 stood at $1,750,   while the price of the cheapest iPhone 7 in India is around $840   onAmazonat current exchange rates.However, recent sales trends in India clearly indicate that   the company is gaining traction among the big-ticket smartphone   buyers in the country. Counterpoint Research reports that Apple   currently commands 62% of the premium smartphone market (phones   costing more than $450) in the country, indicating that it is the   preferred brand for this group.Apple's reputation as a premium brand will be a tailwind in   the long run as India's GDP per capita is expected to rise to   $3,500 in 2020, according to Trading Economics. What's more,   Apple's recent negotiations with the Indian government regarding   the manufacturing of iPhones in the country indicate that it is   looking to make the most of the growing spending power of Indian   consumers.Plans for India get a boostThe Indian government is currently engaged in a campaign,   known as ""Make in India"", to encourage domestic manufacturing of   goods by inviting multi-national companies to set up shop in the   country. Apple is looking to take advantage of this campaign and   has proposed building a local manufacturing plant in   Bengaluru.Bengaluru (aka Bangalore) in India. Image source: Getty     Images.Apple executives, led by the Global Vice-President of iPhone   operations Priya Balasubramanian, met a group of ministers on   Jan. 25 to discuss the company's roadmap in the country. Both   parties discussed building a local manufacturing unit, while   Apple also put forward a list of concessions that it would need   from the government.The Wall Street Journalreported that an official with direct knowledge of the meeting   indicated that the deal between the government and Apple is   almost done. This means that Apple will gain customs duty   exemption on the import of equipment and components for a period   of 15 years.More importantly, Apple's deal with the Indian government   could lead to the opening of company-owned stores in the country.   In order to set up single-brand retail stores in India, the   government requires foreign companies to source 30% of their   manufacturing from local sources. Apple has requested relaxation   on this front, and if the deal closes, then it will soon be able   to set up its own stores in the country as well.Apple has reportedly taken steps to set up a manufacturing   unit in India already by selecting Wistron as its iPhone   manufacturer for the Indian market. The Taiwanese company is said   to be currently expanding its smartphone manufacturing capacity   in Bengaluru, according to theTimes of India.In January, an Indian government official said that Wistron   has requested rapid resolution to its request of expanding   manufacturing operations in Bengaluru. This indicates that it is   looking to meet the April target of beginning iPhone   manufacturing operations in the country.Apple has also lined up Foxconn to meet any surge in the   demand. Foxconn already has a plant in southern India, where it   has doubled its manufacturing capacity in just a year. Foxconn   has already pledged to set up another facility in the country   with an investment of $5 billion. These moves to expand capacity   among Apple's manufacturing partners indicate that they are   preparing for a boost in iPhone production in India.Lower iPhone prices and improving GDP will boost     salesOnce Apple sets up its manufacturing base in India, it will be   able to lower the price of its phones due to import tax   exemptions. Without the 12.5% import tax, Apple could shave   almost $100 from the price of an iPhone 7 in India.This will make Apple more competitive in the premium   smartphone segment as it can grab market share from the likes ofSamsungby offering better prices. This should help Apple achieve its   target of selling seven million iPhones in the country by   2018.Lower iPhone pricing will also allow Apple to benefit from   India's expanding smartphone market. Euromonitor International   forecasts that smartphone sales there will hit the 200 million   unit mark by 2020, as compared to estimated sales of just 102.4   million units in 2016.Paired with the growing spending power of Indian shoppers,   Apple can make significant strides in the country due to its   leading position in this segment.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Next Stop for Nokia Corp (ADR) Stock: $5 a Share!;2/8/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAfter reporting a weak third quarter,Nokia Corp (ADR)(NYSE:NOK) pleased investors this time around by reporting that it would raise its dividends. It will go up from 17 cents to 18 cents a share.makeArticleAd();Source:Open Grid Scheduler / Grid Engine via Flickr (Modified)Despite other disappointments in itsfourth quarter, investors bid NOK higher last week. What may follow for Nokia shares is the $5 level.NOK Stock Earnings RundownWeak Network Division:Sales at NOK's Network division fell 14% year-on-year. The market remains weak but Alcatel-Lucent lifted the performance of the unit. And Nokia maintained a strong gross margin of 40.6%. Operating margin of 8.9% for the full year is within the guidance NOK provided.Nokia Technologies:NOK's earnings did not benefit from IP payments fromSamsung Electronics(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) in the fourth quarter. The company expanded its IP licensing agreement. This is a move that should boost revenue for the technologies unit.Cashing in on Apple:Just asApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) is cashing in on patents by suingQualcomm, Inc.(NASDAQ:QCOM) for high IP royalties, Nokia is suing Apple for infringing on Nokia patents. With 50 patents involved in the suit, expect Nokia at least getting something from Apple. Also, Nokiasaid:""As of today, in actions across 11 countries in Asia, Europe and the US, there are now more than 50 Nokia patents in suit, covering technologies such as display, user interface, software, antenna, chipsets, video coding, as well as 3G & 4G cellular standards. Apple has also filed certain complaints against Nokia.""At 1.15 times sales, investors are not pricing a litigation win in favor of Nokia. Even if NOK is successful, it will take years before the court makes a ruling. Nokia is not the only stock trading at low valuations.Ericsson(NASDAQ:ERIC) is valued at 0.7 times sales. ERIC reported quarterly results that only met earnings expectations. It earned seven cents per share in the quarter, compared to 13 cents per share for Nokia stock, which beat the consensus by five cents.12 Stocks That Will Live and Die by Donald Trump's PenOn its press release, NOK highlighted the $115 billion IP portfolio it holds, thanks to its ownership in Alcatel-Lucent. This further suggests that markets are ignoring the potential for more monetization of IP in the years ahead.Risks to NOK StockEquity and Expenses:Of the nearly $20.9 billion in equity, over half of that amount is goodwill and intangibles. In the fourth quarter, R&D expenses amounted to $1.34 billion. Most of that was due primarily to the amortization of intangible assets from the Alcatel-Lucent acquisition.Smartphone Sales Unknown:Nokia did not forecast revenue for its technologies division. But the company's base case for revenue from patent and brand licensing will total around $863 million annualized. Any new licensing agreement will raise that base case. The networks division represents the bulk of Nokia's business. The mediocre news is that sales are growing in the single digits in the best-case scenario. It expects the primary addressable market falling in the full year (2017). Higher competition and pricing pressure for networking goods will continue to exert negative pressure on the business.Apple Inc. Taps Head of Amazon Fire to Run Apple TV (AAPL)Takeaway on NOK shares:Headwinds are a worry for Nokia shareholders but the market has low expectations for the company. An early settlement with Apple on IP would bring much-needed revenue for the former smartphone giant. Higher customer spending on 5G and networking gear will give the company a lift this year. That will lead to a minimum $5 share price. That is, a forward price-earnings ratio of above 20 times, for Nokia's stock.As of this writing, Chris Lau was long NOK stock.More From InvestorPlace9 Best Cheap Stocks to Buy Now Under $9.997 Stocks That Will Drop by 10% or More This QuarterThe postNext Stop for Nokia Corp (ADR) Stock: $5 a Share!appeared first onInvestorPlace."

Apple Inc. (AAPL) Is No Longer Top Dog in China;2/8/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsEarlier this week, research firm IDC released a report indicating that, for the first time ever,Apple Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone shipments to China have decreased significantly. According to the report, shipments of iPhones to China decreased last year to 44.9 million, a 23.2% decrease from 2015.makeArticleAd();Source:iphonedigital via FlickrApparently, Chinese smartphone makers, particularlyOppo,VivoandHuawei, have increased market share in the region by offering""higher-end gadgetry that appeals to consumers seeking Apple-like quality and innovation.""This has led to an overall decrease in the AAPL market share in China, down to 9.6% from 13.6% in 2015, and a subsequent drop in revenue - Apple's""fourth consecutive year-over-year dip in the region""- by 11.4%.This new situation is potentially disconcerting to a number of analysts and investors, as China has presented a fantastic opportunity for growth in years past.However, due to the challenges faced by American companies attempting to conduct business in China - namely, the Chinese government'soverbearing regulationand frequent demands for controversialapp and product modifications- coupled with the ""ascendancy of cheaper but just-as-good local alternatives,"" sales of the iPhone 7 were less than spectacular.7 Tech Stocks With Explosive Growth PotentialSome analysts have attributed the reduced demand for the iPhone 7 to alack of innovationand significantly higher product prices compared to other countries. This is potentially disconcerting for AAPL stock management and investors alike, since ""China remains an important market for Apple, as it contributes 20.7% of its revenue and is the location for the bulk its [sic] manufacturing facilities.""It's quite possible that AAPL stock will recover in China, and the lull in sales and Chinese-based revenue will reverse when Apple finally reveals its 10th-anniversary edition of the iPhone.Even considering the recent drop-off in both market share and sales in China, Apple stock is still going strong. According to Strategy Analytics, AAPL earned 91% of global smartphone operating profits in the third quarter.Bottom Line for AAPL Stock in ChinaOf the 43 analysts providing recommendations to MarketWatch.com, 33 call Apple stock a buy and 10 call it a hold. The average target price for AAPL stock is $140.57, which represents a potential upside of more than 7% from Tuesday's per-share closing price of $131.35.Overall, Apple stock is still one of the best choices for your tech-centered investment portfolio. While the struggle for dominance of market share in China will undoubtedly be a long and bloody battle, AAPL has a history of producing some of the world's most innovative and compelling products, and this reputation - and expectation from consumers and analysts alike - will ensure Apple stock remains on everybody's short list.As of this writing, Greg Gambone did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace3 Stocks to Buy for Their Coming ReboundCan FireEye Inc (FEYE) Stock Salvage Some Value Through a Sale?9 Best Cheap Stocks to Buy Now Under $9.99The postApple Inc.

Why a PepsiCo, Inc. (PEP) Split Would Unlock 20% Upside;2/8/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMany investors have urgedPepsiCo, Inc.(NYSE:PEP) to split into two companies over the years. One of the most vocal has been Nelson Peltz, the billionaire head ofTrian Fund Management, which in 2014disclosed it owned $1.2 billion worth of PEP stock.makeArticleAd();Source:Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified)Peltz then released a letter urging Pepsi's board of directors to split the company into two, using the proceeds from spinning out beverages towards buyingMondelez International Inc(NASDAQ:MDLZ).Peltz didn't get very far.PepsiCo passionately defended the status quo, saying the company's size helps give it clout with big retailers likeWal-Mart Stores Inc(NYSE:WMT). Having both soda and chips under one corporate roof makes it easier to gain display space. And management is convinced splitting the company in two would lead to negative synergies.Some of those arguments are valid, but one simple fact remains: Pepsi stock holders would be made richer if the company split in two.7 Stocks to Buy That Could Double by 2018Here's why.The Case for a PepsiCo SplitPepsiCo currently divides itself into six different operating divisions:Frito-Lay North AmericaQuaker Foods North AmericaNorth American BeveragesLatin AmericaEurope and Sub-Saharan AfricaPacific and Northern AfricaPepsi operates a little differently in North America versus the rest of the world. In North America, Frito-Lay, Quaker Foods and Beverages are all essentially separate companies. They have different sales teams and different offices, and share little in resources. The three divisions work together in various promotions, but that's about it.Operations in the rest of the world are much different, with chips and soda delivered on the same trucks in many different places.For the sake of this article, let's assume the two North American food companies would form one new company, leaving everything else as the other company.Now we have to look at valuation. In 2015 (the latest fiscal year in which full results are available), PepsiCo as a whole earned $8.35 billion in operating profits. Add back in unusual expenses - which mostly included a $1.4 billion write-off of Venezuelan assets - of $1.59 billion, and PEP posted $9.94 billion in normalized operating profits.PepsiCo has a current market cap of $153 billion, putting PEP stock at a price-to-operating income ratio of about 15.Once we dig a little deeper into the numbers, a theme starts to emerge: Food is a better business than soda.The Value of FoodThe North American Beverages division posted an operating income of $2.75 billion on revenue of $20.62 billion in 2015, good enough for an operating margin of 13.3%. In comparison, the combined Frito-Lay and Quaker North American divisions delivered operating profits of $4.89 billion on sales of $17.33 billion - an operating margin of 28.2%.In short, the soda business is dragging down the real performer: PepsiCo's food business.There is no other major food company in the United States that has 28% operating margins. Most are in the neighborhood of 15%, just like PEP as a whole.There is one that gets close, however.The Coca-Cola Co(NYSE:KO) posted 23% operating margins in 2015. It trades at 18 times operating earnings, but shares are flirting with a 52-week low.If we value a combined Frito-Lay/Quaker company at 20 times operating earnings, it alone would be worth $97.8 billion. That valuation gives it a premium versus Coca-Cola, but not an excessive one. Then if we value the rest of Pepsi at 15 times operating income, it's worth $75.8 billion.The Smart Money: Sears Holdings Corp (SHLD) Is Already InsolventAdd the two divisions together, and Pepsi split into two is worth $173.6 billion - or 20% more than the value of PEP stock today.Bottom Line on PEP StockOne thing is certain. Frito-Lay chips, Quaker Oats and Aunt Jemina syrup are great businesses. Making food is much more profitable on a per-dollar basis than soda.Every PEP stock holder knows the company owns Frito-Lay and Quaker. Many don't know how good those businesses are. If PepsiCo's management spun those two divisions out into a new company, it would highlight just how good the food business really is.It also would attract investors who don't want to invest in soda.As of this writing, Nelson Smith did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceWhy Coca-Cola Co (KO) Stock Is a Great Contrarian OpportunityIs Apple Inc.

Earnings Preview: Guidance Is Key for Pandora Media Inc (P) Stock;2/8/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIt seems unlikely that from a fundamental standpoint, there will be a lot of news in thePandora Media Inc(NYSE:P) earnings report on Thursday.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockPandora already announced last month that fourth-quarter results would come in ahead of guidance for both revenue and adjusted Ebitda. That disclosure sent P stock up 6%, and would seem to limit the possibility that the numbers in the Pandora earnings report will boost the stock further.That doesn't mean there will be no news coming out of Pandora earnings. The company has set itself up for a busy 2017. The replacement of Pandora One with Pandora Plus appears to have had some success in the fourth quarter. Commentary on that initiative will be closely watched on the Q4 conference call.Meanwhile, in December, Pandora announced a new ""Premium"" service to compete with offerings fromSpotify,Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) and others.12 Stocks That Will Live and Die by Donald Trump's PenThat product should roll out shortly, potentially boosting growth in 2017. And Pandora has said it is aiming to return to Ebitda profitability in 2017. The Q4 report should give some color as to whether investors in P stock should believe the company.A Busy 2017 for Pandora StockPandora stock actually is up about 65% over the past year, after coming close to all-time lows in early 2016. Those gains have come despite mixed performance in the business. Revenue is up 14% through the first nine months, and likely rose a similar figure in Q4. But about half the year-to-date growth came from the acquisition of TicketFly last October. Advertising revenue also increased 14% through the first three quarters - but came solely from higher pricing. Active users were actually down year-over-year at the end of Q3, and subscription revenue declined in the quarter as well.The user and subscription figures are a major problem for Pandora stock. The market simply doesn't trust that Pandora can create consistent profits based on advertising revenue alone. That's particularly true given thehigher royalty ratesthat took effect at the beginning of last year. So the move by Pandora to upgrade One to Plus - adding features like song replays - and to develop Premium are a clear step toward a subscription-based model.The plan from Pandora, as detailed after the third quarter, is for that type of model to provide a more stable revenue base. Moving customers to subscription-based services both helps margins and improves retention. If Pandora is successful, Pandora stock likely will rise. But that remains a relatively big ""if.""What to Watch for in Pandora EarningsIn the Pandora earnings report, then, the most important numbers likely will come from the company's guidance. That guidance will give some color as to how successful management thinks Plus has been so far - and what kind of opportunity Premium has to boost Pandora earnings this year.But the Pandora earnings conference call also seems like it might move P stock. Management will have another opportunity to detail its strategy for 2017 and beyond. The company laid out its ""three-legged stool"" strategy - Plus, Premium and Ticketfly - after the third quarter, but investors weren't terribly impressed. Pandora stock fell about 14% over the next seven sessionsThe issue with P stock is that there's a real fear that Pandora's model simply doesn't quite work. The product itself is attractive, as evidenced by the nearly 80 million active users. But it's not clear that Pandora can pay higher royalty rates through ad revenue alone. The company did announce layoffs ofabout 7%of its employees in a bid to improve 2017 profits. That simply raised additional concerns about Pandora stock. The most notable is: Can Pandora really compete with Apple, Spotify andAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN)?After all, those companies have much larger businesses - and much more cash - than Pandora. P stock still is worth almost $3 billion, yet the company has burned about $127 million in cash just in the first three quarters of 2016. Full-year Ebitda loss is likely to be huge as well, and that's not counting depreciation or the additional $139 million in Pandora stock awards.Make Free Profits From Tesla Inc (TSLA) StockFor Pandora stock to appreciate in the near term, the company needs to get at least close to breakeven in 2017. So full-year guidance given in the Pandora earnings report will be key. But that aside, investors also will be looking for more information on the plan going forward here.Can Pandora find a niche in the music industry? Is Pandora Premium ""too little, too late"" against the offerings from Spotify, Amazon and Apple? And is there really a profitable business model here, or are royalty rates simply too difficult to manage?Those questions can't be answered quite yet, but investors will be looking at the Pandora earnings report closely to better assess the company's prospects. And it's likely the commentary on the future - not the past - that will determine how Pandora stock reacts to Q4 earnings.As of this writing, Vince Martin did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Technology ETFs Hitting All-Time High;2/8/2017;"Most of the sectors have been shining this year on proposed Trump policies and stronger earnings and, technology is no exception. In fact, almost every corner of the tech sector is delivering robust performances pushing the stocks higher (read:Will Trump's New Policies Hurt These Sector ETFs & Stocks?).makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');Behind the SurgeMost of the gains came from a string of better-than-expected Q4 results from heavyweights such as IntelINTC, International Business MachinesIBM, NetflixNFLX, MicrosoftMSFT, AppleAAPLand FacebookFBthat have injected a strong momentum into the entire sector, pushing many stocks to fresh highs.Additionally, a strengthening economy and better job prospects gave a solid boost to economically sensitive growth sectors like technology that typically perform well in a maturing economic cycle. Consolidation, increasing consumer spending and rising consumer confidence added to the strength.  Particularly, global IT spending is expected to increase 2.7% to $3.5 trillion this year, according to Gartner while Forrester projects spending to grow 3-4%.In the current emerging digital world, demand for advanced technologies such as cloud computing, big data, smartphones, high-speed fiber networks and the Internet of Things is growing by leaps and bounds. The adoption of innovative products such as wearables, VR headsets, drones, and virtual reality devices are fast becoming technology staples for savvy Americans. This is creating great opportunities for tech companies.Not to forget, most of these tech companies are sitting on a huge cash pile and are in a position to increase payouts to their shareholders. The cash reserves will ensure that these companies are not plagued by financial trouble in a rising interest rate environment.Further, Trump's proposed corporate tax reform, that could allow companies to bring back cash being held overseas at lower rates, is good for tech companies though his protectionist rhetoric including crackdown on immigration and travel ban is weighing on the sector (read:Top ETF Stories of January 2017).Moreover, the upside in this corner of the space could be confirmed by the ZacksSectorRank in the top 38% at the time of writing, suggesting solid growth prospects in the coming months.Given this, tech ETFs have been hitting all-time high levels in recent trading sessions.

How Good Was Apple Inc.'s Q1 Earnings Report?;2/8/2017;"Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) stock has soared about 8% since the company   reported better-than-expected Q1 earnings results last week.   Revenue hit a new record of $78.4 billion, $1 billion ahead of   the average analyst estimate. Earnings per share also reached a   record at $3.36, up from $3.28 a year earlier. This was $0.15   ahead of analysts' estimates.Thanks to this strong performance, numerous Wall Street   analystsraised their price targetsforApple stock. Still, not everybody is convinced. Some pundits have argued   that Apple's results were far worse than Mr. Market seems to   think. Let's take a look at whether there's any substance to that   argument.Good results aside from the iPadFrom a high-level perspective, Apple's Q1 earnings report   looks rock solid. Sure, iPad sales declined yet again -- with   unit sales down 19% year over year and revenue down 22% -- but   the iPad is far less important for Apple's business than it was a   few years ago. Apple only got 7% of its revenue from iPad sales   last quarter.makeArticleAd();The iPad is becoming less and less important to Apple's     results. Image source: Apple.The iPhone business is what really matters for Apple these   days. Apple sold a record 78.3 million iPhones last quarter,   generating $54.4 billion of revenue -- nearly 70% of the   companywide total. Mac sales also returned to growth and the   services segment continued to surge higher, with revenue up 18%   year over year.Did Apple pull a fast one on investors?Writing for MarketWatch last week, Thomas Kee, Jr. argued that   investors have completely misunderstood Apple's earnings report.   He points out that Apple's fiscal first quarter had an extra week   this year.Measured on a per-week basis, Apple's revenue, iPhone sales,   and EPS were alldown on a year-over-year basis. In other words, without the extra week, Apple would likely have   posted declines rather than increases for all three key metrics.   As a result, Kee thinks that Apple stock is significantly   overvalued.It's true that the extra week helped Apple last quarter.   However, in highlighting one anomaly in Apple's first quarter   results, Kee ignored two others that hurt Apple during the   quarter.Channel inventory changes weighed Apple downFirst, Apple is being much more careful with channel inventory   this year than it was in fiscal 2016. Since Apple reports revenue   when it ships devices to retailers -- not when they are sold to   end users -- changes in channel inventory can distort Apple's   revenue and earnings relative to underlying demand.Apple didn't increase iPhone channel inventory by very much     in Q1. Image source: Apple.For the iPhone, Apple grew channel inventory by 1.2 million   units last quarter. This means that 77.1 million of the 78.3   million iPhones Apple shipped during Q1 made it into the hands of   customers.By contrast, a year earlier, Apple increased iPhone channel   inventory by 3.3 million units. Sell-through to end users totaled   71.5 million in that quarter. After adjusting for these channel   inventory changes, last quarter's weekly iPhone sales rate was   almost exactly in line with the prior-year result.This adjustment is even starker for the iPad. Apple reduced   its iPad channel inventory by about 700,000 units last quarter,   compared to a 900,000-unit increase a year earlier. This explains   about half of the year-over-year decline in iPad sales. The   negative impact of the channel inventory changes more than offset   the benefit of having an extra week.A patent settlement skewed Apple's Q1 2016 resultsA second factor that hurt Apple last quarter is that it had   received a one-time $548 million gain related to a patent   infringement case in Q1 2016. This was pure profit, so it boosted   Apple's gross margin by more than 0.7 percentage points in that   quarter and added about $0.10 per share in pre-tax income.Stripping out this one-time gain and the changes in channel   inventory, Apple's revenue and EPS growth would have been much   higher last quarter than what the company actually reported.Additionally, the $548 million patent gain in Q1 2016 created   a tough comparison for Apple's fast-growing services segment last   quarter. Apple reported 18% revenue growth in services last   quarter anyway, but on an apples-to-apples basis it would have   posted a 30% revenue increase.Apple's quarter was as strong as it seemed to beIt's impossible to know precisely how much channel inventory   changes impacted Apple's revenue and profit last quarter. But a   reasonable guess is that they cost Apple $2 billion-$2.5 billion   of revenue and close to $1 billion of pre-tax profit, relative to   Q1 2016. The non-recurrence of the patent gain was an additional   $548 million headwind to revenue and pre-tax profit.After making these adjustments, Apple's revenue may have been   down slightly year-over-year on a per-week basis, but EPS still   increased. Even this sort of slow growth is fairly good for Apple   right now, as the strong dollar is causing persistent revenue and   profit headwinds.Furthermore, Apple is widely believed to be working on a   massive upgrade of the iPhone for 2017. There's a good chance   that these rumors are already impacting the upgrade rate as some   customers hold out for the new model. That bodes well for a   return to robust (and indisputable) revenue and earnings growth   in 2018.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Q4 Earnings Preview;2/8/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsForNvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA), 2016 was as good a year as it was for the Atlanta Falcons. But we know how the Falcons' story ended.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockIs NVDA stock about to undergo a similar fourth-quarter collapse?Going into the Feb. 9 earnings report,analysts are wary, with just half saying buy and most of the rest saying hold - which is something they say when they don't know what to say.Earnings are expected to be just a little better than the previous quarter, net income of something over $550 million, 87 cents per share, on revenues of $2.11 billion, just a little more than last quarter's $2 billion.If Nvidia meets those expectations, however, or even exceeds them only by a little bit, I expect NVDA stock to fall. Here is why.An Overpriced StockNVDA is, to the surprise of no one, incredibly overpriced right now. At the opening bid of $119 per share on Feb. 8, Nvidia stock is trading for 44 times next year's earnings estimates. Its market cap, almost $65 billion, is 13 times its fiscal 2016 revenue, and nearly 9 times its anticipated 2017 revenue.7 Stocks That Will Drop by 10% or More This QuarterMeeting analysts' targets this quarter will show that its incredible October performance was not a fluke, where revenues rose 60% over the previous quarter and profits doubled.My call is not based on Nvidia having done anything wrong.In fact, it isdoing an enormous amount right.Its graphics chips are finding new markets in cloud data centers and in cars. Its original niche in gaming is the only thing happening in the PC space. Huge new markets in augmented and virtual reality are beckoning. Along withQualcomm, Inc.(NASDAQ:QCOM), Nvidia is ending the age ofIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) general purpose microprocessors, replacing it withan era of specialization.The problem is,as our Tim Biggan has observed, that NVDA stock is currently priced for perfection, and perfection is in the eye of the beholder. Any misstep, even an imagined one, can hit a stock hard when it's up 280% in a year.Lots of things could happen. Analysts could decide that meeting expectations is not good enough. They could find a shinier object somewhere else in the market. They could start getting jumpy over a possible trade war, one that has alreadystarted with curbs on visas.Or, perhaps, Nvidia could get intoa spat over licensing of intellectual property, a hot topic wherever silicon chips are made and sold.It's possible.Who Missed the Boat on NVDA Stock?Of course, there is always the chance that this is wishful thinking, as often occurs with hot stocks.Investors and analysts who missed the boat on a stock will talk it down, in hopes that it will drop and they can get on board. This has happened many times with such stocks asAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) andApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL). No tree grows to the sky.For these investors, a fall in Nvidia stock of 15%, to a market cap of about $50 billion - worth 7 times 2017 revenue - would seem more reasonable.Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Due for a Correction?What happens in these cases is that a stock will start to fall, and investors will immediately buy it back to its original, overvalued position. Nvidia does make some very hot hardware, it is continually pushing the performance envelope, and it has strong positions in all the fastest-growing markets of our time.This is one of the differences between investing and trading that investors need to understand. Traders want a hot stock to go down, but that desire, or that fact, does not mean a hot company has grown cold.It means that a lot of people who missed a good dealstill want it.NVDA stock may indeed fall after earnings Thursday evening, in other words. But if it does, a lot of investors will be waiting to pick it up and consider it a bargain.Dana Blankenhornis a financial and technology journalist.

Make Free Profits From Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock;2/8/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMy best results inTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) trades have come fromselling premium against extreme opinions. But in this uber-bullish market environment, I am left only wanting to go long momentum stocks like TSLA orNetflix, Inc(NASDAQ:NFLX).makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockFundamentally, Wall Street seems to have given up looking at Tesla as a car company. The majority of traders I know perceive TSLA as a technology company centering around the battery and sun power.Although fundamentally, TSLA is a difficult stock to recommend at these levels, technically I can argue it wants to retest the all-time highs soon. Luckily, the options markets give me several ways I can enter long trades while building healthy buffer zones.TSLA Stock Trade IdeaClick to EnlargeThe Trade:Sell the TSLA Sep $200 put. This is a bullish trade priced for $11 per contract to open. The 22% buffer from current levels gives me an 80% theoretical chance of success.If TSLA falls below my strike price, I could be put the stock, so I only sell the naked put if I am willing and able to own it at that level. In that case my breakeven price would be $189 per share.12 Stocks That Will Live and Die by Donald Trump's PenThe Hedge - Optional:Sell the Sep TSLA $340 call and collect an additional $5.50 per contract. This trade has an 80% theoretical chance of success. I need TSLA stock to stay under my sold leg or be open to losses. Taking both trades would put me in a sold strangle and widen my breakeven zone to $182 vs. $357.50 per share. I am not rushing to enter the hedge at this time.Selling naked options on a high dollar stock is definitely not suited for everyone. So I can modify the trade to diffuse its risk.The Alternate:Sell the TSLA Sep $200/$195 credit put spread. This is still a bullish trade for which I collect $1.20 per contract. I still need TSLA to stay above my spread to win. Yield on this trade if successful would be 25% on money risked. Theoretically, this also has an 80% theoretical chance of success.This alternate trade could be hedged by selling TSLA Sep $340/$345 credit call spread. This would potentially give me an additional 65 cents per contract thereby lowering my dollars at risk. If both sides of the alternates are successful, the sold iron condor would yield 55% on money risked.As I mentioned earlier, TSLA stock is looking technically frisky, so a very bullish play on that would be to sell the puts and buy near-the-money calls to really profit from a rally for free.Note that earnings are coming soon, and those add an extra layer of chance into the mix.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director ofSellSpreads.com.

Akamai (AKAM) Down Despite Q4 Earnings & Revenue Beat;2/8/2017;"Shares ofAkamai Technologies Inc.AKAMfell 3.7% in after-hour trading following the company's fourth-quarter 2016 results. The decline apparently reflects conservative management guidance, which now expects margins to remain under pressure in the near term, due to continuing investments on new growth avenues like Enterprise Solution portfolio.makeArticleAd();However, Akamai believes that these investments will drive top-line growth in the long term. Management plans to re-accelerate the top-line growth back into double-digit levels in the long term.Adjusted earnings (including stock-based compensation expense and amortization of capitalized stock-based compensation) of 55 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2 cents.Adjusted earnings (excluding stock-based compensation expense and amortization of capitalized stock-based compensation but excluding all other non-recurring items and related tax impact) of 72 cents remained flat on a year-over-year basis but increased almost 6% sequentially.Akamai Technologies, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS     SurpriseAkamai Technologies, Inc. Price, Consensus and   EPS Surprise|Akamai Technologies, Inc. QuoteRevenues of $616.1 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $606 million and rose almost 6.4% from the year-ago quarter (up 7% adjusted for foreign exchange) and 5.5% from the previous quarter. The revenues were better than management's guided range of $593-$613 million. The growth was driven by strong holiday season media traffic.Excluding Internet Platform Customers, revenues increased 14.4% year over year (also 15% adjusted for foreign exchange) and 6% quarter over quarter.Revenues from Internet Platform Customers were $58.4 million, plunging 36.3% year over year (down 40% adjusted for foreign exchange) primarily due to the company's do-it-yourself (DIY) initiatives of building CDN. Sequentially, revenues from Internet Platform Customers inched up 0.6%.Amazon.comAMZN, AppleAAPL, FacebookFB, Google, Microsoft, and Netflix are the six large customers in the Internet Platform group. Collectively these six companies accounted for less than 10% of the Akamai's fourth-quarter 2016 revenues down from almost 16% in the year-ago quarter.Adjusted earnings were $2.70 per share, up 7.1% driven by revenue growth of 6.5%, which totaled $2.34 billion in full year 2016. Revenue excluding Internet Platform Customers was $2.09 billion, up 15% from 2015. Cloud Security Solutions revenue was $365 million, up 43% on a year-over-year basis (up 44% when adjusted for foreign exchange).Segment DetailsEffective second-quarter 2016, Akamai started reporting its business under three main divisions - Media, Web and Enterprise and Carrier. This marks a shift from the earlier product-focused structure to a customer-focused structure.Media Division - Revenues declined 0.5% year over year (flat when adjusted for foreign exchange) but up roughly 5.9% sequentially to $300.8 million. Excluding Internet Platform customers, revenues advanced 15% from the year-ago quarter.Web Division - Revenues increased 13.4% year over year (up 14% adjusted for foreign exchange) and 5.5% sequentially to $300.3 million. Growth was driven by strong customer base, especially with regard to the cloud security business.Enterprise and Carrier Division - Revenues of $15 million surged 26.2% from the year-ago quarter (43% adjusted for foreign exchange) but declined 2.1% on sequential basis.However, in order to give better perspective to its investors, the company continued to report results per its old structure (solution category-wise).Performance & security solutions revenues were up 16.7% year over year (19% adjusted for foreign exchange) to $367.4 million. Of it, $102 million was generated from Akamai's cloud security solutions, which surged 41% on a year-over-year basis.Service & support system revenues rose 14.4% year over year to $52.6 million while Media Delivery solutions sales declined 10.2% year over year to $196.1 million. Excluding the six large Internet platform customers, Media Delivery revenues were up 8% year over year.On a sequential basis, Performance & security, Media Delivery solutions and Service & support system increased 6.5%, 4.3% and 3.5%, respectively.Operating DetailsReported gross margin expanded 30 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter and 200 bps to 67% in the quarter.Akamai reported adjusted EBITDA margin of 41%, down 100 bps each both on a year-over-year and sequential basis.As percentage of revenues, reported research & development (R&D) expense increased 110 bps year over year and 30 bps sequentially. General & Administrative (G&A) expense also increased 170 bps from the year-ago quarter but declined 40 bps from the previous quarter.The year-over-year increase in these expenses were partially mitigated by lower selling & marketing (S&M) expense, which declined 120 bps on a year-over-year basis. However, on a sequential basis S&M increased 170 bps.Reported operating margin contracted 110 bps on a year-over-year basis but expanded 90 bps sequentially to 20%. Adjusted operating margin declined 130 bps from the year-ago quarter but increased 40 bps from the previous quarter.Balance Sheet & Cash FlowAs on Dec 31, 2016, Akamai's cash and cash equivalents (and marketable securities) were $837 million compared with $868.7 billion as of Sep 30, 2016. The company generated cash flow from operations of $181.8 million as compared with $251.4 million in the previous quarter.Free cash flow was $106 million in the fourth quarter. In 2016, free cash flow soared 72% year over year to $550 million.In the quarter, Akamai repurchased 1.3 million shares for $79 million. In full year 2016, the company spent $374 million on buying back approximately 7 million shares.GuidanceFor first-quarter 2017, Akamai continues to expect foreign exchange to remain a headwind due to strengthening of the U.S dollar. Further, revenues are expected to decline sequentially due to seasonal weakness particularly in the Media business. The company expects revenues in the range of $596 million to $610 million.Reported gross margins are expected to be 65%. Adjusted operating expenses are anticipated in the range of $217-$222 million, down sequentially.Further, EBITDA margin is anticipated to be approximately 39-40%. Management forecasts EBITDA margins to remain in the high 30% range in 2017.Depreciation is expected to be in the range of $74-$76 million. Adjusted operating margin is anticipated to be in the range of 27-28% for the quarter.Non-GAAP earnings are projected in the range of 66-69 cents per share.In terms of capital expenditure, Akamai expects to spend approximately $90-$96 million in the quarter. For full year 2017, capital expenditure would equate to 16-18% of revenues, in line with the company's long-term model of 16-18% of revenues and better than 14% in 2016.Our TakeAkamai is likely to benefit from the rising demand for cloud infrastructure solutions, security, mobile products and online video. Additionally, it is likely to gain from its strong foothold in the web applications domain. New products like Enterprise Application Access (EAA) and the Enterprise Threat Protector (ETP) service will expand customer base going ahead.However, DIY initiatives by the large Internet companies remain a concern for the company's media delivery business. Moreover, recently launched products like Bot Manager and Image Manager will take some time to fully penetrate the market. Hence, we don't expect revenue growth to accelerate at least in the near term.Further, faster increase in capital expenditure and increasing headcount investment will keep margins under pressure in full year 2017.Despite the headwinds, we believe that the company has significant growth prospect in 2017. We note that Akamai has outperformed the ZacksInternet Servicesindustry in the last one-year. While the stock has gained 79.8%, the industry returned 18.5% over the same period.Currently, Akamai carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank   stocks here.Just Released - Driverless Cars: Your Roadmap to   Mega-Profits TodayIn this latest Special Report, Zacks' Aggressive Growth Strategist Brian Bolan explores a full-blown technological breakthrough in the making - autonomous cars.

Here's Why Disney's Movie Business Is Likely to Power the Company in 2017;2/8/2017;"Walt Disney (Shutterstock photo)Aside from the very important matter over whether Bob Iger willremainas CEO, The Walt Disney Company (DIS) has had concerns about whether its cable business is dragging down the entire company, as ESPN continues to see subscriber losses. However, it's the company's movie business that's likely to help boost results in 2017, as box office dominance continues for the House of Mouse.Box Office HitsmakeArticleAd();During the calendar fourth-quarter, Disney had over $2 billion in box office revenue, withDr. Strange,Rogue One: A Star Wars StoryandMoanaeach surpassed $500 million, andRogue Onetopped $1 billion. In a world increasingly growing tired of the same old movie choices and the looming threat of superhero fatigue, these results are nothing short of impressive.Of the top five movies at the box office in calendar 2016, all of them were from Disney, according toBox Office Mojo. Disney has managed to take a business such as film, which is notoriously fickle, and churn out hit after hit.Looking ahead to calendar 2017, Disney shareholders can expect more of the same, asBeauty and the Beastis released next month and the year's penultimate film will beStar Wars Episode VIII: The Last Jedi, which hits theaters in December. No longer does Disney release movies that aren't going to be sure fire hits. In 2017, it will release just seven movies, compared to 17 from Warner Bros., which will have box office hits likeThe Lego Batman,Wonder WomanandJustice League, but also smaller releases likeFist Fight,CHiPs,Itand several others.Changing of the Guard(ians)This is no small feat, as Disney likely says no to several good movie ideas for fear they will not resonate with global audiences. That's a similar mindset to what Apple (AAPL) has done with its product lines -- it says no to more good ideas than it says yes to, simply because everything must be great.In a note discussing the company's fiscal first-quarter results, Wells Fargo analyst Marci Ryvicker highlighted that 2017 will see ""SO many good movies coming outBeauty & The Beast,Guardians of the Galaxy 2,Pirates of the Caribbean,Cars 3&Coco,"" but it won't be enough to offset the film slate from 2016, which includedStar Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens.Cable ConcernsDisney is slowly turning its movie business into a subscription business, one with predictable revenues as its other subscription business, Cable, continues to experience uneven results.During the first-quarter, Disney noted that even though operating income at its Cable networks was flat, thanks to lower programming costs and higher affiliate fees, it still saw ""a decline in subscribers"" (i.e. declines at ESPN).Tonally, Iger has been more positive on ESPN in the past couple of quarters, despite the continued trouble for the worldwide leader in sports programming.On the call, Iger said that while the troubles at ESPN get their fair share of attention in the media, ESPN has been expanding its presence in over-the-top bundles, including DirecTV Now, Sling TV, PlayStation Vue and the upcoming Hulu package.Iger also mentioned that Disney ""will be launching a direct-to-consumer sports service sometime in probably calendar 2017,"" but little else was said about it. It's not known if it will be a full-on version of ESPN like what Time Warner has done with HBO Now or if it will be stripped down.Either way, it's important that Disney continue to release direct-to-consumer cable products, as the media landscape continues to change at a breakneck pace.Studio, Parks SupportIt's likely that the Studio business, along with its incredible Parks business, is likely to support Disney shares in fiscal 2017, as ESPN continues to figure out its future in a shifting television landscape.With a strong buyback plan in place, exceptional box office results and the aforementioned Parks business, Disney shareholders are likely to keep singing""you've got a friend in me""-- even beforeToy Story 4hits theaters."

If It Weren't For Capital Returns, Apple Would Have Nearly $400 Billion in Cash By Now;2/8/2017;"Here's an interesting factoid: IfApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) had not implemented its capital return program   back in 2012 and consistently updated it in the years since, the   Mac maker would be sitting on nearly $400 billion in cash.That's not to say that I believe Apple's capital returns are a   mistake. Quite the contrary; I'm a huge fan.A numbers gameAs of the end of 2016, Apple had approximately $246 billion in   total cash on the balance sheet. After adjusting for $77 billion   in total term debt, that leaves a net cash position of $169   billion. But that debt load is predominantly there in order to   fund Apple's capital return program, so if we wanted to imagine   how much cash Apple would have absent its capital return program,   you need to add the total amount returned cumulatively to date to   the current net cash position. Between dividends, dividend   equivalents, net share settlements, and share repurchases, Apple   has now returned $201 billion total. Here's a breakdown:makeArticleAd();Type of Capital ReturnCumulative ReturnedShare repurchases$144 billionDividends and equivalents$51 billionNet share settlement$6 billionTotal$201 billionData source: Apple.Theoretically adding that all back in to net cash, Apple would   be sitting on $370 billion in cash right about now. If it weren't   already clear, that's an inordinate amount of money and far more   than any company would ever need to operate.To help put the sheer magnitude of that hypothetical figure   into perspective, consider how few companies ever get their   entire market capitalization or enterprise value that high.   That's comparable to the current market caps of peer tech giantsAmazon.com($383 billion) andFacebook($381 billion). That's equal to the entire 2015 GDP of the United   Arab Emirates.Thanks, TimNot only does Apple earn very little on that cash since it   invests very conservatively (in CEO Tim Cook's words from 2013,   Apple's investment subsidiary only invests in ""the most conservative investments known to   man""), but that cash also needlessly inflates Apple's total assets.   This in turn increases the shareholders' equity on the balance   sheet.Tim Cook holding the billionth iPhone. Image source:     Apple.In itself, this isn't cause for concern, but there are many   important performance metrics that investors look at which are   derived from these figures. Ratios like return on assets (ROA) or   return on equity (ROE) come to mind, which suffer and reflect   negatively on management's performance if the denominator is   excessively large for no good reason.Steve Jobs had long been irrationally averse to any type of   capital return program, and Cook's implementation of one is   easily one of the most financially significant things he has done   for investors.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

These tech companies could repatriate that cash and use it for investments, dividends and buybacks.makeArticleAd();Tech behemothApple, Inc.(AAPL) made a strong rebound on the back of strong fiscal first-quarter earnings results. The good show was driven by impressive iPhone 7 and 7 Plus sales.

Revenues from iPhone also grew 5% from the year-ago quarter to $54.4 billion (69.4% of total revenue). Moreover, optimism of the tech behemoth's forthcoming series of iPhone upgrades in the coming months encouraged some analysts to raise their price targets.Apple Rally Boosts Tech SectorGains in Apple came as a breather for the broader technology sector.The iPhone maker remained the biggest company in the index in terms of market capitalization. Along with Apple some other big tech companies likeMicrosoft  Corporation(MSFT),Alphabet Inc(GOOGL),Netflix, Inc.(NFLX) andFacebook Inc(FB) reported solid earnings results.Microsoft's earnings per share (EPS) and revenues for fiscal Q2 beat our estimates, while Alphabet reported higher-than-expected revenues for the Q4.

In today's write-up, we are featuring analyst reports on 16 major stocks, including reports on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL-Free Report), Visa (NYSE:V-Free Report) and AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV-Free Report). These stock research reports have been hand-picked from the 70 or so reports published by our analyst team today. You can see all of today's research reportshere >>In addition to these stock research reports, we are also giving you a real-time scorecard of the ongoing Q4 earnings season. We take pride in closely monitoring each and every earnings release and presenting our analysis of emerging trends in the weekly Earnings Trends and Earnings Preview reports. Our latest Earnings Preview report is:All-Time Record Earnings in Q4Q4 Earnings Scorecard(as of Tuesday, February 7th)We now have Q4 results from 302 S&P 500 members, or 60.3% of the index's total membership. Total earnings for the 302 index members that have reported results already are up +6.6% on +4.7% higher revenues, with 68.5% beating EPS estimates and 55% beating revenue estimates.This is better earnings and revenue growth performance than we have seen from this group of 302 S&P 500 members in other recent periods, even after adjusting for the strong growth from the Finance sector (earnings growth would be +5.2% excluding the Finance sector on +4.7% higher revenues). The proportion of companies beating EPS and revenue estimates, however, is tracking below other recent periods. Only 41.1% of the index members are able to beatbothEPS and revenue estimates, which compares to 50% in the preceding quarter for the same sample of 302 S&P 500 members (the 4-quarter average is 47.4% & the 12-quarter average is 45.7%).Looking at Q4 as a whole, combining the actual results from the 302 index members with estimates from the still-to-come 198 companies, total earnings are expected to be up +7.1% from the same period last year on +3.9% higher revenues. This is the best earnings and revenue growth pace in two years. Importantly, the strong Q4 growth is not a function of easy comparisons, but rather a result of actual gains. The fact is total earnings for the S&P 500 index are on track to reach an all-time quarterly record, surpassing the level achieved in 2014 Q4.Estimates for the current period (2017 Q1) are holding up fairly well; they are coming down, but not at the pace as would typically expected. Total earnings for the index are currently expected to be up +8% in Q1, which is down from +10.3% on January 4th.Today's Featured Research ReportsAppleshares have gained +20.2% over the last six months and have outperformed the broader market with the S&P 500 gaining +4.7% over the same period. Apple reported impressive first-quarter fiscal 2017 results with both earnings and revenues exceeding expectations while registering decent year-over-year growth. The increase in iPhone demand caused by the launch of iPhone 7 and 7 Plus was the primary factor for such strong numbers. Also, ""Services"" revenues, which include App store, Apple Music and Apple Pay were impressive with App store sales in December alone topping $3 billion. The buzz surrounding iPhone 8, which is already labeled a super cycle, should allay investors fear about iPhone sales trajectory. However, macroeconomic headwinds in some key regions, most importantly in China along with increasing competition remain a concern.

The company's first-quarter fiscal 2017 earnings easily outpaced expectations. Results were aided by the acquisition of Visa Europe and solid growth in payments volume as well as processed transactions. The analyst likes the company's strategic acquisitions and alliances, technology upgrades and effective marketing efforts. (You canread the full research report on Visa here     >>)AbbVieshares have gained +14.7% over the last one year, outperforming the large cap pharma industry, which has gained +5% over the same period. AbbVie delivered mixed fourth-quarter results with earnings meeting estimates but sales missing the same. The analyst likes its key drug Humira's performance. Sales should continue to be driven by growing awareness, favorable clinical data, additional indications and expansion into new markets. Moreover, products like Viekira and Imbruvica have diversified AbbVie's revenue base. AbbVie has a deep and promising pipeline and is also working on expanding its portfolio though additional deals. On the flip side, the Zacks analyst points out that Viekira faces intense pricing pressure and competition in the HCV market. Additionally, quite a few companies are working on bringing Humira biosimilars to the market.

Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Due for a Correction?;2/8/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThere's no doubt thatApple Inc(NASDAQ:AAPL) has been on fire lately. AAPL stock is up roughly 24% since November, and shares recently popped more than 8% following asolid first-quarter earnings report.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');Source: ShutterstockIn fact, Apple's year is shaping up to be a banner one - especially if the iPhone supercycle comes to pass for the iPhone 8, as many analysts are predicting.But while the long-term looks rosy for AAPL stock, there is plenty of short-term risk in the shares right now.Click to EnlargeApple's impressive run and earnings surge has put shares well into overbought territory. Additionally, AAPL stock is struggling to pull away from the gravity of $130 - an area rife with heavy options open interest in the February and March series.Furthermore, AAPL stock has outrun support from its 10- and 20-day moving averages - trendlines that provided key support throughout the back half of Apple's late 2016 rally. Currently, the 10-day trendline lies near $125, and a correction back to this region would not be unthinkable should a round of profit taking set in.There are short-term sentiment risks for AAPL stock as well. Thomson/First Call reports that 41 of the 49 analysts following Apple rate the shares a ""buy"" or better, with only one ""sell"" rating to be found.That's plenty of room for adjustment.7 Stocks That Will Drop by 10% or More This QuarterAnd with Apple drawing near to the consensus 12-month price target of $139.07, we could see a few brokerage firms downgrade AAPL stock to hold in the next month or so to bring expectations back in line - similar to what Barclays did back in late January, cutting AAPL to ""equalweight"" from ""overweight.""Looking at Apple options, speculative traders appear to be preparing for just such a correction. Typically, Apple's put/call open interest ratio for the nearest two months rests in the 0.6-0.7 range, with a heavy focus toward call OI. The current February/March ratio, however, rests at 0.9, with puts gaining considerable traction and hinting at potential short-term weakness for AAPL stock.As for the magnitude of the anticipated move, March implieds are pricing in the potential for a nearly 4% rise or fall in Apple stock ahead of expiration. That places the upper bound near $135 and the lower bound near $125.Given Apple's reluctance to continue to move higher in the wake of last week's earnings, a correction to the stock's 10-day moving average near $125 could be in the cards.2 Trades for AAPL StockPut Spread:Those traders looking to profit from a short-term drop in Apple might want to consider a March $125/$130 bear put spread. At last check, this spread was offered at $1.28, or $128 per pair contracts. Breakeven lies at $128.72, while a maximum profit of $3.72, or $372 per pair of contracts, is possible if AAPL stock closes at or below $125 when March options expire.Ride Netflix, Inc. (NFLX) Stock on Its Next Pop HigherPut Sell:If you're not willing to bet directly against Apple  stock at this point - and with the shares on a hot streak now, I wouldn't blame you - then we can turn that put spread into a more neutral play by just selling the March $125 put. At last check, this put was bid at 68 cents, or $68 per contract.As always, the upside to this put sell strategy is that you keep the premium as long as Apple stock closes above $125 when March options expire. The downside is that if AAPL stock trades below $125 ahead of expiration, you could be assigned 100 shares for each sold put at a cost of $125 per share.As of this writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceDon't Buy Walt Disney Co (DIS) Stock Until ESPN Is ""Fixed""7 Stocks to Sell as Fear Returns to the MarketThe 7 Most Popular Vanguard Funds for 401k PlansThe postIs Apple Inc.

Apple Inc. Taps Head of Amazon Fire to Run Apple TV (AAPL);2/8/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhenApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) reported its Q1 financials in January, there was little said about Apple TV sales. The poor performance of AAPL's Other Products division - despiterecord setting Apple Watch sales- said it all. However, it looks as though AAPL is turning its focus once again to its often neglected set-top streamer.makeArticleAd();Source: AppleThere's no word of new Apple TV hardware, but the company has made a big move. News just broke that the company hired the former head of rivalAmazon.com, Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AMZN) Fire TV to take over as marketing vice president for Apple TV.New Apple TV Hire Sends SignalsBloombergreported last night that AAPL has hired Timothy D. Twerdahl as thenew marketing VP for Apple TV. Any new hire for the position would be worth noting, but in this case the company's choice is very interesting.According toBloomberg, Twerdahl came to Apple by way of Amazon, where he headed up the very successful Fire TV unit. Snagging one of your primary competitors is always a bit of a coup, but in this case, Apple's hire has an even more compelling background. Prior to his work with the Fire TV, Twerdahl was an executive withNetflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX) and a vice president overseeing consumer devices atRoku.In other words, the new Apple TV boss previously headed up the top two competing video streamers and had a senior position with the world's number one video streaming service. That's a pretty good hire and not one the company would make unless it's serious about goosing those sliding Apple TV sales.7 Tech Stocks With Explosive Growth PotentialBloombergnotes that the previous head of Apple TV marketing is being moved to a role helping to lead AAPL's efforts in securing streaming content deals.Apple TV Needs the PushWhile AAPL's set-top streamer got a sales push with the release of the new fourth-generation Apple TV in 2015, it wasn't able to maintain that momentum. The Apple TV may have games and its own App Store, but unlike the competition, there's no 4K video support and AAPL's box carries a hefty price premium.Even though AAPL doubled its Apple TV sales compared to the previous year when it introduced the new Apple TV in 2015, it still fell short of Roku, Amazon Fire TV andAlphabet Inc's(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Chromecast in market share.AAPL lumps the Apple TV into its Other Products division and doesn't spike out sales numbers. However, in the company's Q1 earnings report, revenue for Other Products declined by 8% year-over-year. Considering that it had a record-setting quarter for Apple Watch sales - the other major product in that division - the numbers point toward poor holiday sales for the Apple TV.No New Apple TV Hardware, YetOf course, even poaching the competition's top guy and someone with the breadth of experience that APPL's new hire appears to have can only go so far without revamping the product.Xiaomi Was Going to Rival Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock -- What Happened?The current, nearly year and a half old, Apple TV carries a huge price premium. AAPL charges a minimum of $149 for its box - double the going rate for competing hardware from Amazon, Google and Roku - and despite the big dollars the Apple TV lacks 4K video support.AAPL was able to shrug that off in 2015 when 4K video was more bleeding edge, but consumers now expect the feature. New content to populate thatTV app hubApple has been showing off won't hurt, but job one for Twerdahl will be dealing with the hardware gap.There's no word on new Apple TV hardware, yet. But with a new VP in place, his predecessor focusing on acquiring additional content and sales continuing to slide, the pressure is on for AAPL to either cut prices or introduce a new, fifth-generation box. Or both.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceApple Inc.

Wednesday’s Vital Data: Facebook Inc (FB), Walt Disney Co (DIS) and Boeing Co (BA);2/8/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsU.S. stock futures are hovering right around breakeven this morning, as Wall Street frets over falling oil prices amid a global glut of supply. The American Petroleum Institute reported a 14.2 million barrel rise in global stockpiles yesterday, and the Energy Information Administration will release its weekly figures later this morning. At last check, crude oil futures were of 0.67% at $51.82 per barrel.makeArticleAd();Against this backdrop, futures on theDow Jones Industrial Averagehave dropped 0.1%, withS&P 500futures also lost 0.1% andNasdaq-100futures are flat.On the options front, volume returned to normal on Tuesday, with about 13.2 million calls and 13.1 million puts changing hands. Over on the CBOE, the single-session equity put/call volume ratio dipped to 0.70, but the 10-day moving average crept higher to a three-month high of 0.70.Turning to Tuesday's volume leaders,Facebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) saw renewed call option interest after RBC Capital and MKM Partners issued bullish research notes. Meanwhile,Walt Disney Co(NYSE:DIS) saw mixed options activity following its first-quarter earnings report andBoeing Co(NYSE:BA) was on the hook for dividend capture plays ahead of today's ex-dividend action.Facebook Inc (FB)The brokerage community was out in defense of FB stock yesterday.RBC Capital reiteratedits ""outperform"" rating and boosted its price target to $175 from $170 on what analyst Mark Mahaney called Facebook's ""wicked strong"" fourth-quarter results. Meanwhile,MKM Partners told investorsthat they should buy any post-earnings weakness in FB stock, noting that Facebook's ""valuation collapse is premature.""12 Stocks That Will Live and Die by Donald Trump's PenWhile call volume has come down considerably from its pre-earnings highs, FB stock options traders remain largely bullish on the shares. In Tuesday's trading, some 365,000 contracts traded on FB, with calls accounting for 58% of the day's take - down from the 71%-73% range ahead of earnings, but up from the recent trend toward 51% of total volume since the report.Looking out to Feb options, FB traders have set their sights on the $135 and $140 strikes, with open interest arriving at 26,000 and 32,000 contracts, respectively. FB stock eclipsed $135 late last week before retreating to support near $130. Clearly, FB options traders are expecting a move higher, though a longer consolidation period may be needed.Walt Disney Co (DIS)IfWalt Disney's quarterly reporttold investors anything, it's that the Mouse's House remains in disarray. Earnings came in at $1.55 per share on revenue of $14.78 billion, compared to expectations for $1.49 per share on sales of $15.3 billion.Year-over-year comparisons were tough, given that the year-prior saw blockbusterStar Wars: The Force Awakensrake in $2 billion for Disney. However, ESPN remains an albatross around Disney's neck, as it was almost entirely to blame for an 11% drop in the company's cable operating income.DIS stock options traders were nonplussed heading into the event, as calls only eked out 54% of the more than 313,000 contracts traded on the shares. That said, the overall opinion among options traders remains bullish for DIS.Currently, the February/March put/call OI ratio rests at 0.58, with calls nearly doubling puts among options set to expire within the next two months. The March $115 strike is by far the most popular among DIS bulls, attracting nearly 28,000 contracts.Boeing Co (BA)Boeing stock made a rare appearance on the top ten most active options listing on Tuesday, with dividend capture strategies likely driving the bulk of yesterday's volume. BA stock trades ex-dividend today, with stockholders of record as of the close last night eligible for a quarterly dividend of $1.42 per share to be paid on March 3.Nike Inc (NKE) Stock Could Lose ANOTHER ShoeOverall, 244,000 contracts traded on BA, with calls gobbling up 96% of the day's take. Given that calls are a favorite for dividend capture strategies, it's a safe bet that most of this activity was related.But BA stock has been a hot topic for options traders outside of yesterday's dividend related activity. The shares recently hit an all-time high of $170 following a solid quarterly earnings report, andcould be headed higher once againafter profit taking runs its course.As of this writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace9 Best Cheap Stocks to Buy Now Under $9.997 Tech Stocks With Explosive Growth PotentialThe postWednesday's Vital Data: Facebook Inc (FB), Walt Disney Co (DIS) and Boeing Co (BA)appeared first onInvestorPlace."

Apple Inc. (AAPL) Nears $100 Billion In Debt: What Does This Mean?;2/8/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsA few days after declaring its earnings,Apple Inc.(AAPL) raised $10 billion indebt. Similar to the bond sales done in the past, this will also be carried out in various tranches with maturities of up to 30 years.makeArticleAd();The bonds will include both fixed rate notes and floaters.Apple Raises Debt a Little Earlier Than UsualThere was nothing much to say about the new bond offering, and it was much like other papers sold by the company every year.However, this time, the company raised bonds a little earlier than the tradition, and it is now nearing $100 billion in debt, according to Evan Niu ofThe Motley Fool.Usually, these bond offerings are announced after the iPhone maker gives updates to its capital return program, which is conducted some time in April or May. However, the company needed to sell the bonds a little early this year due to various reasons. The California-based company started its ninth share repurchase program in the previous quarter, and total share repurchases came at $11 billion.This depleted its cash reserves, and totalcashat the end of the quarter came in at around $15.9 billion. This is the low end of the usual  range of $15 billion to $25 billion that the company keeps for operational and strategic needs, notes Niu.As the company uses debt for capital returns purposes, its total debt taken over the past five years has grown significantly large.By the end of 2016, the iPhone maker had $87.5 billion in long-term debt and commercial paper. With the recently-raised $10 billion, it will total somewhere around $97.5 billion. The debt has an investment-grade rating.12 Stocks That Will Live and Die by Donald Trump's PenHowever, in the future, Apple's credit rating profile may deteriorate with a rise in debt levels, notes Niu.Meanwhile, RBC Capital Market analyst Amit Daryanani advises investors to buy Apple stock, as the iPhone maker might increase its capital return to shareholders.RBC Capital Markets maintained its 'Outperform'rating.The analyst said that most investors are assuming that upside is somewhere around $140-$150 at present, but there could be an uptick in the stock on the back of higher capital allocations.""We believe the fundamental reality remains that AAPL's valuation is materially sub-par to what we anticipate its long-termrevenueand EPS potential,"" Daryanani says.On Monday, Apple shares closed up 0.95% at $131.53.

Why Apple Inc.'s Profit Dropped Last Quarter;2/8/2017;"Apple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) most recent quarter was quite good, with the   company delivering revenue and earnings per share ahead of   expectations, thanks in no small part to better-than-expected   iPhone revenue.Nevertheless, despite the better-than-anticipated financial   performance, the company's operating income dropped from $24.17   billion to $23.35 billion. Net income declined from $18.36   billion in the year prior to $17.89 billion.Apple's iPhone coupled with AirPods. Image source:     Apple.makeArticleAd();Apple is still raking in alotof cash -- most companies could only dream of generating roughly   $18 billion inannualnet income, let alone bring in that much in a single quarter --   but investors should pay attention when profit declines. Let's go   over the key factors that drove Apple's operating and net income   figures down year over year, even as the company achieved record   quarterly revenue.Lower gross profit marginApple saw its gross profit drop from $30.42 billion in the   prior-year period to $30.18 billion in the company's most recent   period. Although the company's revenue was up year over year,   cost of sales grew at a faster pace than revenue did, resulting   in a decline in gross profit margin.Apple did note on its most recent earnings call that in the   prior-year period, Apple's revenue ""included the benefit of a   one-off $548 million patent infringement payment."" Though not a   substantial part of Apple's $75 billion-plus in revenue in that   quarter, CFO Luca Maestri did say that this payment boosted gross   margin in the year-ago quarter by 40 basis points, or 0.4%.The gross-margin story isn't the only thing that drove Apple's   profits slightly lower year over year, though.Higher operating expensesGross profit margin is an important part of overall   profitability, but a company's operating expenses -- which   include product development costs as well as sales and marketing   costs -- are also key determinants of a company's   profitability.Though Apple only increased its sales, general, and   administrative expenses by just shy of $100 million year over   year, its research and development spending surged to $2.87   billion -- up more than $400 million from the roughly $2.4   billion the company spent in the prior-year period.Apple's operating expenses grew 9% from $6.25 billion in the   prior-year period to $6.82 billion in the most recent quarter.   Since operating-expense growth was greater than revenue growth,   which was approximately 3.3%, operating expenses became a larger   part of the company's revenue and thus negatively affected   operating profit margin.What does this mean for Apple investors?The key headwinds to Apple's operating profit right now seem   to be the company's continued increases in research and   development, coupled with slow revenue growth.It's probably not a good idea for the company to let up on its   research and development investments, as the investments made   today are what allow the company to have a chance of bringing   compelling new products to market tomorrow, potentially driving   revenue and profit increases over the long term.In the near to medium term, Apple's best bet of returning to   consistent operating profit growth is likely to be from faster   revenue growth. Hopes seem to be high that Apple's   next-generation iPhone models will drive a so-called ""super   cycle"" such as what the company enjoyed with the iPhone 6-series   of products beginning in late 2014.If that comes to pass, Apple could see significant   year-over-year revenue growth in the first quarter of its coming   fiscal year.Looking out longer term, though, it's hard to predict if and   how the company will deliver sustainable profit growth. Can the   company's core product categories do it?

3 Reasons Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock Is STILL the King;2/8/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsLast week, e-commerce giantAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) released disappointing holiday sales figures that caused investors to question the firm and send AMZN stock down roughly 3%. While the company produced fourth-quarter earnings that surpassed expectations, the firm's revenue and future guidance figures came in below estimates.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockAmazon's lacklusterearnings resultsmay have shocked the broader market, but investors would be wise to use AMZN stock's loss as a buying opportunity because shares of the company very rarely go on sale.Amazon has a lot of potential and its willingness to invest in the future makes it a great long-term bet. While AMZN stock is still expensive at just over $810 per share and a price-to-earnings ratio of 186, the firm's share price could make its way above $900 by the end of the year.AMZN Stock: Three Reasons to Keep the Miss in PerspectiveIt's never a good thing when a company misses revenue expectations and issues worse-than-expected forward guidance. However, it's important to take a look at why AMZN's fourth-quarter earnings shook out the way they did and whether it's a deal breaker for investors considering picking up Amazon stock.Some of the reason for the revenue miss can be explained by currency fluctuations, whichhurtthe retailer's revenue figures by around $558 million. Amazon is also adjusting to its fast-growing marketplace and the number of merchants that have joined the firm's ""fulfilled by Amazon"" program.10 Stocks to Buy That Already Make America GreatThis has in-turn increased shipping costs, but the long-term benefits of the growing number of ""fulfilled by Amazon"" merchants outweigh the short-term negatives. It allows Amazon to offer its Prime members a greater selection of items and will likely help AMZN grab an even larger marketshare.Speaking of Amazon Prime, the loyalty program is another good reason for investors to get behind Amazon stock. Not only do Prime's subscription fees provide AMZN with a passive revenue stream, but the program helps bind people to its ecosystem.Prime has expanded to include benefits like dash-buttons, which allow people to reorder certain products at the click of a button, and movie and music streaming. Prime members who use all of Amazon's services are not only more likely to buy additional Amazon products like the firm's virtual assistant Alexa, but they will also shop at its website before considering rivals - even if it doesn't offer the lowest prices.AMZN is doing with retail whatApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) did with technology: building a brand that people will continue to buy into because it is convenient and connected.Here's How Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Can Hit $200However, while the company's dominance in retail is a big reason to buy AMZN stock, one of the most compelling elements of the firm's business is Amazon Web Services - the firm's cloud computing arm. The cloud computing space represents a huge area for growth as the industry is relatively new, but AWS has already become one of the largest players.AWS has been slowly making up a larger and larger percentage of Amazon's total sales, and the fourth quarter was no exception. The firm's cloud computing arm has been growing rapidly over the last year and as the industry continues to expand, investors can expect AWS to add to Amazon's bottom line in a larger and larger capacity.Bottom Line on Amazon StockAMZN stock's stumble last week has given investors an opening to add shares to their portfolios. While there was some weakness in the company's fourth-quarter results, the firm is on track to continue growing and Amazon stock will likely deliver outstanding gains in the year ahead.As of this writing, Laura Hoy was long AAPL and AMZN.The Top 10 Dow Dividend Stocks for February7 Gold Stocks That Will Shine Under TrumpThe post3 Reasons Amazon.com, Inc.

The Most Cash That Apple, Inc. Has Ever Had;2/7/2017;"You'd think that after returning over $200 billion in cash to   investors through its capital return program over the past five   years, that there'd be a sizable dent inApple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) money mountain. You'd be wrong.To be clear, Apple's cash position would certainly be about   $200 billion more if it weren't for the program, but the fact   still stands that Apple generates so much cash that it simply   can't give that money back fast enough. Operating cash flow was   $65.8 billion in fiscal 2016, which ended in September. Even   after deducting $12.8 billion in capital expenditures, the Mac   maker enjoyed $53 billion in free cash flow -- leaving plenty to   cover the $12.2 billion paid out in dividends and dividend   equivalents and buying back $30 billion worth of stock. The same   is true for the most recent fiscal first quarter.Apple Store Pudong. Image source: Apple.makeArticleAd();Here's the thing: It's also true for almost every year since   Apple started returning capital. Capital returns have exceeded   100% of free cash flow in only one fiscal year since the program   commenced (2014, and only by about 12%). The net result is that   despite the massive amounts of capital being returned, Apple now   has the most cash it's ever had on the balance sheet. For a   company that loves superlatives as much as Apple does, it's   almost surprising that it didn't point this out on last month's   earnings call.Cash is kingAs of the end of 2016, Apple was sitting on $246 billion in   total cash, which is the highest its cash position has ever been.   Even if you were to factor in debt, which is predominantly used   to fund the capital return program, and look at Apple's cash   position on a net basis, that's also the highest it's ever been.   Despite its best efforts to return as much as possible, Apple's   cash keeps marching higher. Gross cash and net cash begin to   diverge in 2013 when Apple starts taking on debt, but you can see   both are at all-time highs.Data source: SEC filings and author's calculations. Chart by     author. Calendar quarters shown.It's also true that Apple's cash is increasingly concentrated   abroad, as the debt is used as a way to avoid repatriation taxes.   At this point, 94% of Apple's total cash is held by foreign   subsidiaries. This figure was closer to 60% half a decade   ago.Data source: SEC filings and author's calculations. Chart by     author. Calendar quarters shown.What comes nextGiven this, combined with the fact that Apple is currently   reviewing its capital return plans and will give investors an   update in April, there seems to be plenty of room for Apple to   get even more aggressive if it wants to. When it launched the   capital return program, it finally acknowledged years of   criticisms that the company had way more cash than it would ever   conceivably need -- and it currently has about $60 billion more   (or about 50%) net cash than when it started capital returns.The curve ball is the practical limit on how much debt Apple   should take on. If the company can convince the Trump   administration to deliver on that repatriation holiday promise,   that could potentially pave the way for some type of massive   return or special dividend. Otherwise, that money mountain is   only getting bigger.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

What Happens to Qualcomm Inc. if the NXP Deal Gets Killed?;2/7/2017;"Shares ofQualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM) have plunged nearly 20% since the beginning of the   year due to a double whammy of bad news. First, the U.S. Federal   Trade Commission filed anantitrust lawsuitagainst the chipmaker, claiming that it  leveraged its   portfolio of critical wireless patents to push competitors out of   the market. Shortly afterwards,Applesued Qualcommfor allegedly withholding ""rebate"" payments for its use of   Qualcomm modems.But that was just the tip of the iceberg -- Qualcomm has been   struggling with other similar antitrust lawsuits across the world   over the past two years. It was fined $975 million and forced to   slash its licensing fees in China, fined another $854 million in   South Korea, and could face up to $3 billion in additional fines   in Europe and Taiwan.Image source: Qualcomm.makeArticleAd();However, the impacts of those fines and reduced licensing fees   are overshadowed by a much bigger long-term risk -- the potential   cancellation of its planned$47 billion acquisitionofNXP Semiconductors(NASDAQ: NXPI) . Let's see what could happen to Qualcomm if this   massive deal gets derailed.A brief look at Qualcomm's problemsQualcomm has two main business units -- the chipmaking one   (QCT) and the licensing one (QTL). The QCT unit, which sells its   flagship Snapdragon mobile chips and baseband modems, generates   most of its revenue. The QTL unit, which owns a massive portfolio   of 3G/4G patents, generates most of its profits.Both businesses have been under pressure over the past few   years. The QCT unit has been losing market share to cheaper chips   from challengers likeMediaTekand first-party ARM chips from big OEMs like Apple,Huawei,Samsung, andXiaomi. The QTL unit is struggling with the aforementioned regulatory   scrutiny, since many OEMs consider its cut (up to  5%) of   the wholesale price of each smartphone sold to be too high.To offset those declines, Qualcomm is diversifying the QCT   business intoadjacent markets, with specialized Snapdragon chips for wearables, drones,   connected cars, and other Internet of Things (IoT) devices. A   crucial part of this push is in the connected car, which is   widely considered a next-gen computing platform. To gain a   foothold in this market, Qualcomm acquired IoT and    automotive chipmaker CSR for $2.4 billion in 2015.Why Qualcomm needs NXPTo expand further, Qualcomm agreed to buy NXPin order to   also expand into new market -- namely automobiles. NXP became the   top automotive chipmaker in the world after its $12 billion   purchase of Freescale in late 2015. NXP also holds leading   positions in the networking and safety systems markets. Qualcomm   expects the combined company to generate annual revenues of over   $30 billion (compared to Qualcomm's estimated revenue of $23.8   billion this year), and help it establish leading positions   across the mobile, automotive, IoT, security, RF, and networking   markets.Qualcomm believes that the deal will grow its ""serviceable   addressable markets"" by about 40% to $138 billion in 2020, and   that the deal will be ""significantly accretive to non-GAAP   earnings immediately"" after it closes. It expects the deal to   generate $500 million in annualized run-rate cost synergies two   years after the deal closes.This deal will clearly help the QCT pivot away from the   sluggish smartphone market. But it will also greatly expand the   QTL's patent portfolio, which could enable Qualcomm to collect   licensing fees across a much wider range of industries.Why the deal could run into troubleThe FTC has already accused Qualcomm of charging competing   baseband modem makers higher license fees for its wireless   patents, which made their modems pricier for smartphone makers to   use. Therefore, the FTC is unlikely to approve a deal which could   give Qualcomm the same power over other growing markets like IoT   devices and connected cars.If the FTC lawsuit derails the NXP deal, Qualcomm will be left   with a fading QCT business and a potentially crippled QTL one --   which would cripple the chipmaker's long-term growth prospects.   Some analysts have speculated that Qualcomm might need to divest   some businesses or split in two (along the QCT and QTL lines) to   gain regulatory approval -- but splitting its low-margin and   high-margin businesses could yield unpredictable results.However, some analysts believe that the FTC will simply drop   the case, since Maureen Ohlhausen -- a Republican who was   recently appointed as the interim chairwoman by President Trump   -- previously expressed her  strong opposition to the   lawsuit. During last quarter's conference call, Qualcomm CEO   Steve Mollenkopf expressed confidence that the  deal would   close, and that recent legal actions were merely ""driven by   commercial disputes.""The key takeawayAs a Qualcomm investor, I'm disappointed with the recent legal   actions against the chipmaker. While those moves might force   Qualcomm to lower its licensing fees, I'm not convinced that they   will derail the NXP deal. The risks have certainly gone up for   Qualcomm, but I still believe that its forward P/E of 11 and 4%   forward yield could limit its downside potential.10 stocks we like better than QualcommWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Tech Stock Roundup: Industry Comments on Visa Ban;2/7/2017;"The technology sector has grown increasingly dependent on foreign talent over the years such that today it can't function without it. On the face of things, this has been really good for innovation helping the U.S. maintain its technological lead over others. But digging down a bit deeper, what this means is that the U.S. is increasingly incapable of producing this talent itself. This is not a good situation to be in, particularly when you consider that countries like China are doing all they can to develop indigenous intellectual property.That's probably the reason President Trump's draft proposal according to Bloomberg reads as follows: ""Our country's immigration policies should be designed and implemented to serve, first and foremost, the U.S. national interest… Visa programs for foreign workers... should be administered in a manner that protects the civil rights of American workers and current lawful residents, and that prioritizes the protection of American workers - our forgotten working people - and the jobs they hold.""There are many conflicting views and opinions about H-1B visas that companies use to employ people from other countries when adequate resources in the fields of science, technology, engineering and math aren't available locally. But since foreign labor is usually cheaper, critics say that companies tend to employ foreigners even when the skills are available thus depressing wages for the industry as a whole.Ron Hira, an associate professor at Howard University, has done extensive research on the topic. Supporters say there isn't room to control wage inflation since the program is highly regulated and technology companies like AmazonAMZN, AppleAAPL, FacebookFB, AlphabetGOOGLand MicrosoftMSFT, in fact, pay handsomely.Whatever the opinion on the wage rate, there's no denying that the jobs go to foreigners. If the trend continues, high tech American employees will have a harder time finding jobs, thus gradually closing down the institutions producing them. The per capita GDP attributable to such jobs will also go down as tech employees from abroad obtain American citizenship.It's also true that a country is in a position of absorbing others, giving them a home, a job, etc. when it is itself in a position of strength. But when it can't find local tech workers, it's definitely not in that position and may need some temporary measures to rejuvenate.There's also another side to the story. If tech companies are unsuccessful in their letters of appeal, lawsuits and other measures they're taking against the President and the proposal is enforced, they may decide to employ the same talent in international facilities. A company's main motivation and objective is to generate profit, and there could be initial costs of setting up such international operations.The visa issue has been clubbed with another important one involving terrorism because the President has blocked all refugees from entering the U.S. for 120 days (the ban is indefinite for Syrian refugees possibly because of their acts of vandalism across Europe). Citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries like Sudan, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen were also banned from entering the U.S. for 90 days. This seems like a relatively short period of time and what will be achieved in the interim remains unclear.In the meantime, Attorney General Bob Ferguson, a Democrat, filed a complaint saying Trump's order is ""undermining the state's sovereign interests"" in violation of equal protection laws under the Fifth Amendment. Washington State also sued the President with support from Amazon and Microsoft.But don't imagine that the so-called refugees are helpless victims because they have plenty of powerful lobbies working for them. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) are getting ready to file lawsuits. What's more, Google has created a ""crisis fund"" with $2 million and its employees have contributed a like amount that they are gifting the ACLU. Other funds are also on the way.But tech companies have plenty to say about both issues:Apple: CEO Tim Cook told employees that the company had communicated with the White House. ""I've heard from many of you who are deeply concerned about the executive order issued (Friday) restricting immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries. I share your concerns. It is not a policy we support…Apple would not exist without immigration, let alone thrive and innovate the way we do,"" he wrote in an email.Google: CEO Sundar Pichai wrote in a memo to employees: ""It's painful to see the personal cost of this executive order on our colleagues…We've always made our view on immigration issues known publicly and will continue to do so."" He also said that at least 187 Google staff were affected by the ban.Founder Sergey Brin: ""It's a debate about fundamental values and thoughtful policymaking and many of the other things, I think, that are apparently not universally adored but I think the vast majority of our country and legislators support."" Google has a problem with the orders, including ""extreme vetting"" of immigrants. After planning their move for some days 2K+ Google employees from at least eight Google offices walked out on Monday afternoon.Facebook: Founder Mark Zuckerberg wrote on his Facebook page: ""Expanding the focus of law enforcement beyond people who are real threats would make all Americans less safe by diverting resources, while millions of undocumented folks who don't pose a threat will live in fear of deportation."" In an official statement on Saturday, Facebook said: ""We are assessing the impact on our workforce and determining how best to protect our people and their families from any adverse effects.""IntelINTC: Brian Krzanich: ""I have heard from many of you, and share your concern over the recent executive order and want you to know this is not a policy we can support,"" and ""First, as the grandson of immigrants and the CEO of a company that was co-founded by an immigrant, we believe that lawful immigration is critical to the future of our company and this nation.""One of Intel's first hires was Andy Grove, who survived the Nazi occupation of Hungary and ran Intel for 11 years establishing it as the leader in microprocessor technology. He also said: ""At Intel we believe that immigration is an important part of our diversity and inclusion efforts"" and ""Inclusion is about making everyone feel welcome and part of our community.""Its official statement says, ""We are providing support to potentially impacted employees, all of whom are in this country lawfully. As a company co-founded by an immigrant, we continue to support lawful immigration. We will continue to provide any impacted employees with Intel's full support.""A statement on the company website says that it supports ""legislative or administrative action to improve the immigration system for highly skilled employees."" Half its 106K employees work in other countries and its U.S. workers include roughly 3K foreigners on work visas for those with specialized skills. But the number of employees from the seven banned nations is not known. Intel explained its contribution to Trump's inaugural committee by saying that it gave Intel a seat at the table on issues important to the company.Microsoft: Microsoft's president and chief legal officer Brad Smith wrote in a letter to the Secretary of State Rex Tillerson that there are currently 76 U.S. visa holders within the tech firm and 41 dependents who are citizens of the seven countries mentioned in the order. ""These are not situations that law-abiding individuals should be forced to confront when there is no evidence that they pose a security or safety threat to the United States,"" he said.Satya Nadella, Microsoft's CEO, said, ""As an immigrant and as a CEO, I've both experienced and seen the positive impact that immigration has on our company, for the country, and for the world"" while posting Smith's email to employees on LinkedIn. Microsoft is trying everything to keep its options open. On the one hand it is joining Washington state to sue Trump while on the other, it is requesting the government to make an exception for ""responsible known travelers with pressing needs"" so people with passports from one of the countries listed in the order can return to the U.S. as long as they have a valid work or student visa and have not committed a crime in the U.S.Micorsoft is also asking that employees and students affected by the ban be allowed to travel outside of the U.S. for business reasons, except to the seven countries on the list. It is also asking that people with passports from one of the countries be allowed to go home for family reasons on a case-by-case basis.Tesla: CEO Elon Musk, one of only a few tech executives on Trump's business advisory team and manufacturing jobs initiative: ""The blanket entry ban on citizens from certain primarily Muslim countries is not the best way to address the country's challenges,"" he tweeted on Saturday. ""Many people negatively affected by this policy are strong supporters of the US. They've done right, not wrong & don't deserve to be rejected.""TwitterTWTRCEO Jack Dorsey called the impact of the order ""real and upsetting.""Netflix: CEO Reed Hastings said, ""Trump's actions are hurting Netflix employees around the world, and are so un-American it pains us all… It is time to link arms together to protect American values of freedom and opportunity.""UberCEO Travis Kalanick told employees he would talk to Trump about it in President Trump's first business advisory group meeting. ""While every government has their own immigration controls, allowing people from all around the world to come here and make America their home has largely been the U.S.'s policy since its founding. That means this ban will impact many innocent people,"" Kalanick said.BoxCEO Aaron Levie who is Iranian-American said ""At the corporate level, we are trying to take inventory on who could be impacted and ensuring that they stay within the country for now... We are really just getting a handle on the legal side of the situation, what we can fight and ultimately how we protect employees in the process."" More broadly, the order sends ""the wrong moral message to the world and within our own country,"" Levie said. ""It's very unfortunate and very disappointing.""SlackCEO Stewart Butterfield said ""Immigration is unambiguously an economic benefit, but that doesn't matter: do the right thing because it's right,"" he wrote in a series of posts on Twitter. ""My grandfather came from Poland between the wars, at 17, sponsored by an elder sister. Two more siblings made it. Everyone else died.""Sam Altman, president of Silicon Valley tech incubator Y Combinator said in a blog: ""It is time for tech companies to start speaking up about some of the actions taken by President Trump's administration... The tech community is powerful. Large tech companies in particular have enormous power and are held in high regard. We need to hear from the CEOs clearly and unequivocally. Although there is some business risk in doing so, there is strength in numbers-if everyone does it early this coming week, we will all make each other stronger.""CompanyLast WeekLast  6 MonthsAAPL+5.85%+20.10%FB-0.98%+5.29%GOOGL-2.95%+2.39%MSFT-3.22%+12.51%INTC-3.83%+4.79%CSCO+1.10%+1.92%AMZN-3.06%+5.53%Other stories you might have missed-CorporateApple in India: Apple will be assembling some iPhones in Bengaluru, the capital city of the south Indian state of Karnataka according to the state's IT minister Priyank Kharge. Taiwan's Wistron is setting up the unit that is expected to commence operations in the first half of 2017 (or by April-end according to some news sites).Apple has been trying to get concessions from the Indian government but progress on that front is not clear as of now. India is an important market for Apple, which sold 2.5 million iPhones in the country in 2016. An estimated 750 million smartphones will be sold in India by 2020, so one can understand why Apple CEO Tim Cook said that India is ""the place to be.""Apple Manufacturing In U.S.: Terry Gou, CEO of Apple's largest contractor Foxconn, has said that the company, along with top customer Apple, is considering the setting up of a display panel manufacturing unit in the U.S. that could create up to 50K jobs. The decision followed Softbank CEO Masayoshi Son's announcement about a $50 billion investment fund for the U.S.The Nikkei reported that another Pennsylvania plant was also in the works, but it would be involved in molding functions.  Foxconn-controlled Smart Technologies may also move production to the U.S. if President Trump is able to renegotiate the North American free trade agreement.Barclays Downgrades Apple: Barclays analyst Mark Moskowitz doesn't have high expectations of the iPhone 8 because the maturing of the smartphone market means fewer upgrades and a tendency to buy lower-priced, older models. He also believes that ""long-term growth opportunities related to India, services, the enterprise, artificial intelligence, and maybe even the cloud still exist;"" however, he does not ""expect these potential 'what's next?' opportunities to emerge as major needle movers over the next 12 months for Apple's model.""  He therefore downgraded the shares from overweight to sector weight.Ford Snaps Up Apple Executive: Musa Tariq, Apple's global marketing and communications director for retail, is joining Ford as its chief brand officer. Tariq's experience includes initiatives to enhance the retail experience at Apple's 490 stores. As Ford evolves as a company making vehicles in a self-driving world, it will be increasingly blending technology and auto, so it's easy to see that the brand might need repositioning. Steering the company through these changes seems to be the role Tariq will play.Ajit Pai Is FCC Chairman: Net neutrality opposer Ajit Pai has been appointed Chairman of the FCC by the Trump administration. Pai was one of two Republicans on the five-member board, so his elevation won't require senate approval. He replaces Tom Wheeler, who resigned soon after Trump won the elections. Streaming companies like Netflix, Apple and Amazon won't be too pleased although Netflix indicated that its fan following provided it a certain amount of leverage with carriers. The truth is, it already has arrangements with carriers that allow them to charge it differential rates, contrary to the principles of net neutrality.Facebook Gets New VR Chief: Facebook has made an important hire in Hugo Barra, who has spent the last three years revving up the marketing machinery at Xiaomi (the success of the Mi3 and Redmi smartphones are attributed to him) and serving as Google's Android chief before that. Facebook's VR plan is more on the high end, which has somewhat impacted the adoption of the Rift, so it's easy to see how it could benefit from experience.Barra will replace Brendan Iribe as Oculus head and will also head up all VR efforts at Facebook. Iribe will move to the PC division, to speed up PC-based VR development. As part of his recent testimony defending Oculus technology, Zuckerberg said earlier that VR will take five to ten years to go mainstream and that Facebook will probably have to spend another $3 billion before it gets where it wants to go. So it clearly has long range plans.Microsoft to Invest $1 Billion in Cloud Security: Microsoft has said that it will continue to invest a billion dollars into cloud security over the next few years and some say this is excluding acquisitions (such as Aorato for enterprise security, Adallom for general cloud security applications, and Secure Islands, for protection of data and files) and investments through its venture capital arm.The adoption of cloud infrastructure by enterprises to a great extent hinges on the security of offerings. This along with the far greater competition in the cloud than in desktop computing makes security very important for Microsoft. Since the company now has a synchronized operating system across platforms in windows 10, it can hope to bring increasingly secure offerings and thereby pick up market share.Microsoft Bond Sale: Soon after raising $19.75 billion in bonds in Aug 2016, Microsoft sold another $17 billion worth. The seven-part offering will be used for general corporate purposes and to help repay $26 billion in short term debt used to acquire LinkedIn.Moody's assigned a Aaa rating to the issue on the basis of a business model that will remain exceptionally robust as it continues to transition from on premise licensing to cloud based software subscription and service offerings. Investors haven't taken bond issues by tech companies badly because it's well known that they have huge cash piles parked overseas. The practice may change going forward if tax reform brings more of this cash back home.Microsoft Creates CTO Position: Kevin Scott, former SVP of infrastructure and operations at LinkedIn, will fill the newly created position of chief technology officer at Microsoft to push adoption of Microsoft products and services at LinkedIn customers and members. He will report directly to CEO Nadella. Scott previously worked at Google and AdMob.Nadella Joins Starbucks Board: Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella will join Sam's Club CEO Rosalind Brewer and LEGO Brand Group executive chairman Jørgen Vig Knudstorp on Starbucks' board of directors, if the shareholders approve the appointments at the annual general meeting in March. The appointments will expand the size of the board from 12 to 14 as long-time director Jamie Shennan will retire before the meeting.Snap IPO Reveals Google Cloud Deal: Inside documents filed by Snap was a deal with Google to use its cloud computing platform to run the Snapchat app; not just that, there is a minimum purchase agreement of $400 million a year, although in the first four years, up to 15% may be moved to a subsequent year. Snap doesn't make a whole lot of money just yet, (just $404.5 million in 2016) but its service is very popular and using Google's cloud could help it scale.Google Is Top Brand Again: Brand Finance, one of the firms providing a list of leading brands, says that Google has claimed the top position for the first time in 5 years, replacing Apple. Google's strength is seen in its prowess in search, which is the mainstay of its advertising business and where it remains ""largely unchallenged"". Apple is seen as repeatedly underperforming expectations and its inability to ""demonstrate that genuinely innovative technologies desired by consumers are in the pipeline"".Google Hires VR Employee: Just a few months after Google launched its Daydream View VR headset (basic features and head strap packed into a stylish package that retails for just $49), the company has hired away Claude Zellweger, who headed HTC's VR unit. Zellweger led the team responsible for the Vive VR headset, so this is probably an indication that Google has big VR hardware plans.Alibaba Leading Funding Round in India's Paytm: Alibaba is leading a $200 million funding round in Paytm Ecommerce, which was spun out of One97 Communications. One97 also offers the Paytm Digital Wallet, in which Alibaba and its financial arm own a high stake. Alibaba is not entering the Indian ecommerce market directly at this stage but through startups like this one and Snapdeal. Other big players include Amazon and Flipkart.Activision's Consumer Products Division: Activision has created a division to make more out of its popular video games and has appointed Tim Kilpin former president and chief commercial officer of Mattel, to head the unit. Activision's goal is to develop consumer-type products based on its video game franchises (toys and apparel for example) so Kilpin, with his experience developing the hugely popular ""Monster High"" dolls (Mattel's first intellectual property in more than 30 years) will come in handy.Legal/RegulatoryFacebook Fined in Oculus Case: A jury has decided that ZeniMax will receive $500 million from Oculus owner Facebook as it was guilty of copyright infringement, the failure to comply with a non-disclosure agreement, and for the misuse of Oculus trademarks. The amount to be paid is split up as follows: $200 million for violating a non-disclosure agreement, $50 million for copyright infringement and $50 million for improper use of ZeniMax trademarks.It will also pick up $150 million in damages from Brendan Iribe and $50 million in damages from Palmer Luckey, the two Oculus co-founders. However, the court ruled that the Rift maker wasn't guilty of trade secret theft, a point that will be used by Oculus to frame its appeal.Google Privacy Policy Under EU Scrutiny: Google made a significant change to its privacy policy back in June. The change, while enabling users to more easily see and delete the information that Google has on them, also alters Google's age-old policy to separate data on Gmail and YouTube from its widely used DoubleClick business. The change therefore empowers Google to build better customer profiles and thereby serve more targeted ads. Oracle, which is part of a coalition called Fairsearch that tries to make life as difficult as possible for Google, brought it to the attention of regulators last year and they are now looking into the matter.Amazon Would Rather Settle with EU: Amazon's parity clause that forced ebook publishers to always offer it the same terms as rival platforms has been under EU scrutiny. The investigation started in Jun 2015 with the goal of determining whether the facility prevented other distributors from competing with Amazon by offering new and innovative products and services. Now that the EU has opened it up for feedback from rivals and customers, Amazon is attempting to settle the matter with publishers so it isn't called upon to pay a fine, which could be as high as 10% of its global turnover.New Technology/ProductsApple Watch Patent: Apple has won a patent for a modular metal band for its Watch. The modules can be used to house batteries, haptic devices that provide a sensation to the user, displays, photovoltaic cells, cameras, GPS sensors, speakers and a range of health sensors including thermometers, hygrometers, blood pressure sensors and sweat sensors. The limited space in the wearable to serve individual customer needs was the reason for developing the band.Apple Mac Chip Could Hurt Intel Business: Both Boomberg's Mark Gurman and Ian King and RBC analyst Amit Daryanani have given views on how an Apple developed co-processor(codenamed T310 for Macs based on ARM technology can hurt Intel's chip business. According to Bloomberg, the Apple chip, which went into development last year, will gradually take over the functions of the Intel processor, paving the way for Apple's processor independence.But chips generally take 3-4 years to get into mass production, so Daryanani's view that it will not impact Intel's business in 2017 and also possibly in 2018 makes sense. He says that if Intel is totally designed out, it will be a $2-3 billion hit to annual revenue, $750 million to $1 billion hit to operating income with a 12-16 cent impact on the annual EPS.Intel Go: Intel is boosting its automotive efforts by creating a new division called Intel Go to solve hardware problems like computer vision, infotainment, 5G wireless connectivity and AI technology. It will also offer related software solutions. Intel holds the view that the car is the next computing hub and it intends to do all it can to grab a greater dollar share. As cars incorporate more electronics and move towards complete automation, Intel's innovations, partnerships and investments may be expected to put it in front and center of the new opportunity as it unfolds.Google Instant Apps: First announced at the 2016 Google I/O conference, Instant Apps are a workaround between full apps and the web. Single-use or infrequently-used apps sometimes have to be downloaded because the mobile web browsers of companies aren't that great. Since unnecessary downloads are nothing but wasted memory and space, Google will stream parts of the apps from its own servers, so neither the download nor the mobile web is required. The company is now rolling out the service to select users.Slack's Answer to Microsoft: The Slack Enterprise Grid designed for larger and more complex businesses offers identity management technology, data loss prevention and advanced security systems. The Slack solution is also compliant with regulatory requirements in healthcare and finance sectors, which may be partly responsible for its swelling user base.The company said that it now has 1.5 million paying users, which is commendable since it doesn't offer many other computing building blocks that rival Microsoft does. In Nov 2016, Microsoft announced Teams, which connected the chat feature with the Office 365 cloud suite, thereby facilitating collaboration. The two are now competing head-on.M&A and CollaborationsCisco Buys AppDynamics: Cisco paid $3.7 billion for AppDynamics, an application performance management company just before it was scheduled to float its IPO. The purchase price was more than double the amount the company hoped to raise at its IPO and almost double the $1.9 billion valuation at its last funding round. Cisco has been trying to build the software and services side of the business, with particular focus on the emerging Internet of Things. The acquisition will surely provide the ""end to end visibility and intelligence from the network through the application"" that it is looking for and could nudge up software revenue from the current 29%, but the price tag looks high.Alibaba Affiliate Buys MoneyGram: Alibaba's payments arm Ant Financial is buying Nasdaq-listed MoneyGram for $880 million. MoneyGram focuses on peer-to-peer transactions and includes cross-border currency transfers. It also claims to have 350K physical locations across 200 countries. Ant Financial handles nearly 90% of digital payments in China and has also made strategic investments in India-based Paytm as part of its international push. MoneyGram will go a long way in furthering this objective.Some NumbersApple Watch Market Share: According to Strategy Anlaytics, Apple sold 5.2 million Apple Watch devices in the fourth quarter of 2016, slightly higher than 5.2 million units in the year-ago quarter, grabbing a 63% share of the market. Samsung was second with a 10% share, or 800K units (it sold 1.3 million units a year ago).Zacks' Top 10 Stocks for 2017In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2017?Who wouldn't?

Apple Inc.'s Mac Is Back on Track;2/7/2017;"For a while there,Apple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) Mac business was really struggling. Not only was   it a victim of a generally weak personal-computer market, but a   stale product line in the face of aggressive moves from competing   computer vendors also led the company to underperform the broader   market.Apple MacBook Pro computers. Image source: Apple.makeArticleAd();That, by the way, is a nice way of saying the company lost   market share.Last October, though, Applefinallylaunched new MacBook Pro machines. It updated both its 13-inch   and 15-inch MacBook Pro lines, and because of all the new   features it packed into these updated systems, the company   charged higher prices for them than it did for the   prior-generation models.Now that Apple's first-quarter financial results are out --   the first quarter in which the company would recognize revenue   for the new systems -- investors can get an idea of how well   customers have received the new systems.And, perhaps unsurprisingly, things are looking good.Putting Mac back on a growth pathApple reported shipping 5.37 million Macs in the first quarter   of its fiscal year 2017, netting $7.24 billion in revenue from   those sales. Mac unit shipments were up from the 5.31 million   Apple shipped in the prior-year period, amounting to 1.1%   growth.That's not a huge amount of growth, but considering the 10%   unit decline that Apple's Mac business suffered last year, that's   an improvement.Though unit growth was positive but anemic, the revenue growth   story was completely different. Apple's Mac revenue in its most   recent quarter was up 7% year over year, implying a solid   increase in Mac average selling prices.""The Mac not only returned to growth but generated its highest   quarterly revenue ever,"" Apple CEO Tim Cook proclaimed on the   company's first-quarter earnings call.It's still early in the current MacBook Pro product cycle, but   it seems customers were willing to pay extra for the added   features and technologies Apple added to its latest MacBook Pro   machines.Apple knows what it must doI'd hazard a guess that it won't take any miracles or   game-changing innovations to allow Apple's Mac product line to   continue to at least perform in line with the personal-computer   market. Apple simply needs to make sure it provides regular   updates to its Mac products so the lineup doesn't get stale.These regular updates can be as simple as adopting the latest   processors and adding other technological improvements, though   obviously the bigger and more interesting the changes -- think   the Touch Bar, the Force Touch trackpad, and so on -- the   better.The Mac doesn't make up a huge portion of Apple's annual   revenue. Mac sales made up less than 10% of Apple's fiscal   first-quarter revenue, though this percentage is bound to   increase as Apple moves past the peak iPhone quarter. And when   taken in conjunction with Apple's other non-iPhone products, it's   still a reasonable contributor to revenue.Further, much has been said about the strength of Apple's   ecosystem and the company's ability to build products that work   well together. If the company can sell more Macs, then that might   also translate into customers who will switch to -- or stick with   -- Apple's iPhone.Apple should do its very best to make sure all of the elements   of its ecosystem are strong, to maximize the potential value it   can extract from said ecosystem.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

3 Mutual Funds to Buy on Apple's Robust Earnings;2/7/2017;"The tech sector has performed favorably in recent times on the back of encouraging earnings results.Although Trump's proposed trade and immigration policies are expected to weigh on big technology companies, hiscorporate tax repatriation planscould benefit technology companies that hold a lot of cash overseas. These tech companies could repatriate that cash and use it for investments, dividends and buybacks.Tech behemoth Apple IncAAPLmade a strong rebound on the back of strong fiscal first-quarter earnings results. The good show was driven by impressive iPhone 7 and 7 Plus sales. Following these promising trends, investing in technology mutual funds with a significant holding in the iPhone maker and other tech giants will be a prudent decision.Q1 Earnings in FocusApple's fiscal first-quarter earnings of $3.36 per share and revenues of $78.4 billion easily topped the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.22 and $76.9 billion. On a year-over-year basis, earnings and revenues registered growth of 2.4% and 3.3% respectively. Services, which include revenues from Internet Services, App store, Apple Music, AppleCare, Apple Pay, licensing and other services, surged 18% year over year to nearly $7.2 billion.Additionally, total iPhone unit sales came in at about $78.3 million, up 5% year over year. Revenues from iPhone also grew 5% from the year-ago quarter to $54.4 billion (69.4% of total revenue). Moreover, optimism of the tech behemoth's forthcoming series of iPhone upgrades in the coming months encouraged some analysts to raise their price targets.Apple Rally Boosts Tech SectorGains in Apple came as a breather for the broader technology sector. The iPhone maker remained the biggest company in the index in terms of market capitalization. Along with Apple some other big tech companies like MicrosoftMSFT, AlphabetGOOGL, NetflixNFLXand FacebookFBreported solid earnings results.Microsoft's earnings per share (EPS) and revenues for fiscal Q2 beat our estimates, while Alphabet reported higher-than-expected revenues for the Q4. Both Netflix's and Facebook's top and bottom line for the Q4 beat our respective estimates.For the overall Technology sector, we now have Q4 results from 84% of the sector's total market cap.Total earningsfor these companies are up +7.4% from the same period last year on +5.4% higher revenues, with 71.1% beating EPS estimates and 78.9% beating revenue estimates.In the past three months, the tech sector jumped 9.8%, remaining one of the best performers among the S&P 500 sectors. In the last one month, the tech sector rose 2.7%, way above the S&P 500's gain of 0.7%. Additionally, mutual funds related to this sector registered strong returns.

Here's How Apple Inc. Plans On Doubling Services Revenue Over 4 Years;2/7/2017;"If you've been paying close attention, you'll notice thatApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) has been very conscientiously trying to shift   investor focus away from things like iPhone unit sales in favor   of recurring revenue sources like services.That's why the iPhone maker even introduced a non-GAAP metric   for installed base-related purchases in early 2016, only tostop reporting itjust a few quarters later (likely due to the SEC cracking down on   companies abusing non-GAAP metrics). The iPhone sold rather well   over the holiday quarter, setting a fresh quarterly record, but   Apple is still very much wanting investors to better appreciate   its services business.iCloud. Image source: Apple.makeArticleAd();For 2016, Apple's services revenue hit a new milestone,   crossing $25 billion in revenue for the first time. Services   should even be large enough to be a stand-alone Fortune 100   company in 2017. Not one to rest on its laurels, Apple is   ambitiously hoping todoubleservices revenue over the next four years.150 million subscriptions and countingOn the earnings call, CEO Tim Cook noted that Apple now bills   over 150 million paid subscriptions through the various content   platforms that it operates. That includes both Apple's own   services as well as third-party subscriptions. This is a new   metric that Apple has not disclosed previously, and it will be   important to see this number grow (if Apple continues providing   updates, that is). There was no update on how many Apple Music   subscribers the company now has, but the most recent update from   December was 20 million.Apple Music. Image source: Apple.More color surrounding these subscriptions would go a long way   toward analyzing the services business. I have no shortage of   questions. Are those 150 million subscriptions all discrete   users, or are there multiple subscriptions per user? What's the   average monthly recurring amount? What categories (such as video,   audio, or other) are seeing the most interest? Has there been any   uplift from thereduced 15% cuton long-term (longer than one year) subscriptions? Many   enterprise-oriented apps utilize subscription models; how much is   the enterprise contributing to subscriptions?When asked how Apple will get to its goal, CFO Luca Maestri   did add some additional detail:And what is particularly interesting to us is to see that     the number of people that are transacting on our stores is     increasing strong double digits, and we're also seeing that the     [average revenue per user] per paying customer is increasing     double digits, right? So it's a combination of the two,     obviously the quality and the quantity of content that we make     available in our services improves all the time. And we also     see that as people getting to the platform and start     transacting on the platform, and we keep track of their     behavior over time, we actually see that they tend to spend     more and more over time.Interestingly, Maestri also noted that iCloud storage and   AppleCare are growing ""very well"" and are at all-time highs as   well. Apple last cut iCloud storage prices in late 2015, making   the service more competitive with rivals (iCloud storage used to   be overpriced). Meanwhile, services like iCloud Photo Library   increase the need for cloud storage. On the AppleCare front, more   customers tend to buy Apple's extended warranty when newly   designed products come out due to the higher initial repair   costs, and those new MacBook Pros with Touch Bars are both new   and pricey.Take what you can getHere's another way to look at it: Product sales are unlikely   to be major growth drivers at this point since the businesses are   already so large. The only new product that could theoretically   start taking off is Apple Watch, but we know the smartwatch   market is in the dumps and Apple still aggregates its wearable in   the ""Other Products"" segment. It's unlikely that Apple Watch will   suddenly become a $25 billion business within the next couple of   years (the entire Other Products segment is under $11   billion).If total revenue remains relatively flat, but services can add   another $25 billion in sales over the next few years, that would   represent over 10% growth.

Biometrics And Payments: Companies Are Using Your Fingerprints For Cybersecurity;2/7/2017;"The endless catalog of alphanumeric passwords, pins numbers, and rising online security breaches and frauds is one of the harsh realities of the digital payment ecosystem. In order to strengthen the security of transaction mechanisms while retaining convenience, the payments industry is fast exploring alternative methods, biometrics being one of them.Biometrics is a unique way of identifying a person using biological traits such as fingerprints, hand geometry, DNA, IRIS scan, voice waves, and facial recognition.With its unique ability to reduce rejection rates of authentication, combat cybersecurity threats, overcome user disdain for stronger passwords and provide a smoother user experience, more and more companies are embracing the use of biometrics to add an extra layer of safety to their operations.makeArticleAd();According to astudy, biometrics is fast becoming a part of consumer lives with approximately 190 million mobile devices (smartphones and wearables) enabled with some form of biometrics as of 2016 and such installation is projected to exceed 600 million devices by 2021.It is furtherestimatedthat there will be 770 million biometric authentication apps downloaded annually by 2019. These figures highlight the growth in the biometric technology, its market size, and adoption rate.The biometrics market isexpectedto reach more than $30 billion by 2021, backed by a boost from consumer electronics, particularly smartphones. According to areportby PricewaterhouseCoopers, ‘biometrics and advanced authentication’ lists among the top five cybersecurity spending priorities for the next 12 months.Here’s a look at some of the companies in the payments industry which have adopted some form of biometrics.Apple, Inc. (AAPL)has been a trendsetter of fingerprint scanners for authentication since 2013. ItsTouch IDis now available across itsdevicesfor making payments via ApplePay. In fact, areportpoints out that Apple Pay will “push the number of biometrically authenticated transactions to nearly 5 billion by 2019, up from less than 130 million in 2015.”One of the recentpatentsgranted to Apple pertains “to capacitive fingerprint sensing systems, and more particularly to the use of an electrostatic lens to increase the resolution of a capacitive sensing system.”Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. (SSNLF)provides an alternative to the traditional password with Samsung Pass. WithSamsung Pass, instead of less-secure passwords, users are offered to use a fingerprint scan or iris scan for authentication purposes. Samsung Pay offers fingerprint authentication and is working on NextG biometric sensors to make Samsung Pay and its devices more secure.A 2016studybyVisa, Inc. (V)in Europe reveals that “two-thirds of consumers want to use biometrics when making payments while three-quarters see two-factor authentication, where a form of biometrics is used in conjunction with a payment device, as secure.” Back in September 2015, VisaintroducedEMV Chip-based biometrics trial to allow cardholders to use fingerprint readers in lieu of passwords at ATMs owned by South Africa’s Absa Bank.In October 2016,MasterCard Incorporation (MA)launchedan exciting pilot project to boost the security of transactions at checkout counters in stores by using facial recognition by simply taking a ‘selfie’ to authenticate payments. In case of a web store, the authentication is done via finger scan or selfie recognition.PayPal Holdings, Inc. (PYPL)made its first move into the biometric space in 2014 when itcollaboratedwith Samsung Galaxy to be able to pay on mobile and in-store using fingerprints. In 2016, Lenovo partnered with PayPal, Intel and Synaptics to secure online transactions with a finger touch. PayPal in the App Store also supports Touch ID authentication.Alipaythe world’s largest third-party platform operated byAnt Financial Services Groupthat had spun-off from Alibaba(BABA)in 2011 began toprovidefacial recognition as a simpler and more secure login method to its customers in December 2015. Last year, Ant Financial Services Group announced the acquisition of EyeVerify, “the creator of Eyeprint ID, a patented, secure mobile eye verification technology.” Theaccuracyprovided by Eyeprint ID’s is 99.99%, the same as Touch ID. In January 2017, Ant Financial announced of its acquisition of MoneyGram International, Inc. (MGI).Final WordGiven the fact that people are complacent with easy and repeated passwords, the job for digital hackers has become easier, making it harder for service providers to provide security. Areportby Verizon points out that “63% of confirmed data breaches involved leveraging weak, default or stolen passwords.” In such a scenario, biometrics emerges as a technology that not just offers ease and lower costs, it works well as an identification and security method, especially when used with another layer of authentication."

Fretting over Trump's Policies? 5 Safe Value Bets;2/7/2017;"Though the earnings season is at its peak, President Donald Trump has been keeping investors busy elsewhere. Investors keenly await clarification on the timing and scope of Trump's business-friendly policies and how the administration will balance tax cuts and infrastructure outlays with protectionist trade policies. The President has also acted promptly on executive orders ranging from a temporary immigration ban to the withdrawal from landmark trade pacts.Investors, in the meantime, also assign greater risk premiums to European countries where anti-establishment movements are gaining traction ahead of elections. Amid such apprehensions, it will be wise to invest in value stocks. Value investors look for times of uncertainty to pick stocks at a discount, which are fundamentally stable.Travel Ban Triggers UncertaintyTrump banned immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries, including legal residents and visa holders. This decision has drawn congressional criticism and widespread protests. These protectionist measures may also cloud the path for pro-business initiatives as several world and corporate leaders condemn the ban. German chancellor Angela Merkel said that it is ""not justified to put people from a specific background or faith under general suspicion"", while French president Francois Hollande said that ""withdrawal into oneself is a dead-end response"".Airlines bore the brunt as well as several airports across the country saw violent protests, disrupting operations to a great extent. Such an executive order on immigration, widely known as the ""Muslim Ban"", is being met with resistance by an increasing number of major tech firms.Tech giants Microsoft CorporationMSFTand Amazon.com, Inc.AMZNhave taken legal action against the executive order as they face obstacles in sourcing labor from foreign lands. Tim Cook, Apple Inc.'sAAPLCEO in an email sent to staff said that Trump's order ""is not a policy we support"". He added that ""diversity makes our team stronger"". In fact, 97 tech giants including Alphabet IncGOOGL, Facebook IncFBand Netflix, Inc.NFLXfiled a joint legal brief in protest of Trump's immigration ban.Alphabet, promptly, created a $2 million crisis fund for four campaigning organizations such as American Civil Liberties Union, Immigrant Legal Resource Center, International Rescue Committee and UNHCR, while Sundar Pichai its CEO said that ""it's painful to see the personal cost of this executive order on our colleagues"".Trade War Could Hit EconomyInvestors, in the meanwhile, may ignore Trump's trade rhetoric at their own peril. The administration's pledge to protect U.S. industries and redefine currency relationships could lead to a trade war with dire consequences, eventually sparking a sell-off. In order to put ""America First"", Trump may retreat from global trade sending exporter's currency plummeting, curbing corporate revenues and destroying consumption.Trump has withdrawn the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership and is mulling over the imposition of a border tax on imports. The administration had accused China, Mexico, Germany and Japan of keeping their currencies weak to gain trade advantages, which is irking even those who were bullish after the election.Caution Spreads Amid Geopolitical RisksWhile a highly polarized political environment and Trump's confrontational approach are expected to fuel volatility in the market, investors are also preparing for political upheavals across Europe including French and German elections later this year.French Socialist Member of Parliament and supporters have started to break ranks with their party after the primary election win of leftwing presidential nominee Benoît Hamon, offering support to independent candidate Emmanuel Macron. In Germany, Martin Schulz is to run as the Social Democrat candidate for chancellor after Sigmar Gabriel turned down the chance to oppose Angela Merkel in parliamentary election.5 Top Value Stocks to Buy NowIn a sign of how large the President's policies loom over the market, an analysis of FactSet data shows that one out of four companies were anxious about Trump's policies during their most recent earnings conference calls. Add to this more political disorder across Europe and we all know why investing in value stocks is judicious.Value investors look at uncertain times as opportunities to pick up financial sound stocks at a discount.  Such companies are well-established to do business even in the worst of times and are protected against market vagaries.Successful investors like Warren Buffett also recommend choosing stocks that are momentarily underpriced compared to the underlying value of the company, especially in an investment climate marked by skeptical investor behavior.Thanks to our newstyle score system, we have been able to identify five solid value stocks.

Don’t Miss the Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA) Stock Rally!;2/7/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIf you missed out on the post-earnings rally forAlibaba Group Holding Ltd(NYSE:BABA), your chance has come back around again. After rallying to $105 following arecord-breaking earnings report, Alibaba stock has pulled back to the psychologically significant $100 area, marking a prime entry point for a long position as BABA eyes all-time highs.makeArticleAd();Click to EnlargeAlibaba stock has spent the past several sessions consolidating into the $100 region, helping the shares to blow off an overbought condition.Not only is $100 home to key technical and sentiment support, BABA's 20-day moving average is also rising into the area, providing an additional springboard for the shares.As for sentiment, Wall Street remains widely bullish on Alibaba stock. According to data from Thomson/First Call, analysts have doled out just five ""hold"" ratings compared to 37 ""buy"" or better ratings. Additionally, the 12-month consensus price target of $125.19 represents a roughly 25% premium to Monday's close.Short sellers, however, aren't so keen on Alibaba stock. During the most recent reporting period, the number of BABA shares sold short rose by 4% to 114 million shares, or roughly 10.5% of the stock's total float. As Alibaba stock rallies off support at $100, these shorts may be forced to buy back their bets, thus adding fuel to the fire for BABA shares.7 Stocks That Will Drop by 10% or More This QuarterThat said, short sellers may be a bit nervous right now, if BABA's options activity is any indication. Currently, the March put/call open interest ratio for Alibaba stock rests at 0.61, with calls nearly doubling puts among options set to expire within the next two months. In other words, either BABA call traders are betting on a continued rally, or short sellers are hedging their bets with purchased calls. Either way, this high degree of call OI is a bullish indicator for Alibaba stock.2 Trades for Alibaba StockCall Spread:For those looking to bet on a Alibaba stock bounce from $100, a March $105/$110 bull call spread has some impressive profit potential. At last check, this spread was offered at 94 cents, or $94 per pair of contracts. Breakeven lies at $105.94, while a maximum profit of $4.06, or $406 per pair of contracts, is possible if Alibaba stock trades at or above $110 when March options expire next month.Here's How Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Can Hit $200Put Sell:If a more neutral positions suits your trading style more, then a BABA March $97.50 put sell position has a solid chance at finishing out of the money. At last check, this put was bid at $1.44, or $144 per contract. Remember that you keep the initial premium received as long as Alibaba stock closes above $97.50 when March options expire.

Talks iPhone Upgrade Rate;2/7/2017;"Apple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) iPhone 6s product line, launched in September   2015, ultimately underperformed the company's wildly successful   iPhone 6 product line in terms of sales. A key reason for this,   Apple CEO Tim Cook told investors at the time, was due to the   company's seeing fewer customers opting to upgrade their iPhones   during the iPhone 6s cycle than it did during the iPhone 6   cycle.""From an upgrade perspective, during the first half of [fiscal   2016], the upgrade rate for the iPhone 6s cycle has been slightly   higher than what we experienced in the iPhone 5s cycle two years   ago, but it is lower than the accelerated upgrade rate that we   saw with iPhone 6,"" Cook explained back on the company's April   2016 earnings call.Apple iPhones. Image source: Apple.makeArticleAd();On Apple's most recent earnings call, CFO Luca Maestri   provided some insight into what the upgrade rate is looking like   for the current iPhone 7 product cycle -- let's take a closer   look.More of the same, but that's not badMaestri explained that the percentage of Apple's iPhone   installed base that has upgraded to the company's latest iPhone   7-series smartphones ""has been very similar to"" what the company   saw with the prior-generation iPhone 6s-series smartphones.Although last year's iPhone 6s cycle proved to be a bit   disappointing, this news is much better delivered this time   around than it was last year for several reasons.First, Apple's iPhone installed base has likely grown year   over year, so a constant upgrade rate applied to a larger   installed base should mean that more phones get sold -- clearly a   positive for Apple.Next, investors often focus on year-over-year trends. Last   year, the upgrade rate that Apple saw with the iPhone 6s relative   to the iPhone 6 negatively affected the company's financial   results year over year. This year, a flat upgrade rate relative   to the prior generation means that the year-over-year financial   result comparisons won't be as tough.And, finally, while the percentage of the iPhone installed   base that migrates to the latest iPhones might be flat generation   over generation, Apple seems to be getting a boost by selling a   richer product mix.As I notedhere, Cook told investors that the company is selling more iPhone 7   Plus phones as a percentage of total iPhone 7-series (i.e., ""new   product"") sales than it did of its prior-generation iPhone 6 Plus   or iPhone 6s Plus. The Plus models are more expensive than their   non-Plus counterparts, so this is a positive for Apple's iPhone   product mix and, ultimately, revenue.Can Apple accelerate that rate in the future?Maestri offered some additional insight into the factors that   impact the upgrade rates of Apple's new iPhones.""The point that I think I need to make when you think about   upgrade rates, clearly, this issue of the strong dollar doesn't   help us,"" Maestri began.He then went on to suggest that if the company weren't forced   to raise iPhone pricing in certain countries because of foreign   exchange movements, the company could potentially ""sell   significantly more and significantly faster from an upgrade cycle   standpoint.""Beyond the foreign exchange situation, Maestri also pointed   out that ""the more [Apple is] able to innovate with new   generations of products, clearly that plays a role in the upgrade   rate.""The rumors swirling about Apple's next-generation iPhone   models suggest that the improvements could be much more   significant generation-over-generation than what the company   delivered with the iPhone 7-series. Time will tell if they are   enough to catalyze the iPhone upgrade rate that Apple sees.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Tuesday’s Vital Data: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD), Twitter Inc (TWTR) and Netflix, Inc. (NFLX);2/7/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsU.S. stock futures are in rally mode this morning, afterGeneral Motors Company(NYSE:GM) bolstered premarket sentiment with itsfourth-quarter earnings beat. Additionally, stocks are being bolstered by a rising U.S. dollar, which is up nearly 1% after Philadelphia Federal Reserve President Patrick Harker said late yesterday that a March interest rate hike was ""on the table.""makeArticleAd();At last check, futures on theDow Jones Industrial Averagehad advanced 0.23%, whileS&P 500futures were up 0.29% andNasdaq-100futures were higher by 0.21%.On the options front, volume plummeted on Monday following Friday's brisk session. On the day, only about 11.4 million calls and 11.8 million puts changed hands - coming in well below average. Over on the CBOE, the single-session equity put/call volume ratio leapt to 0.75, though the 10-day moving average held at 0.69 for the fourth straight session.Turning to Monday's volume leaders,Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMD) surged more than 11% after rumors hit the Street that the company was collaborating with chief rivalIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC). Elsewhere,Twitter Inc(NYSE:TWTR) call traders continued to ramp up their positions heading into Thursday's quarterly earnings report, andNetflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX) short sellers appear to be hedging their positions.Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD)AMD stock is on fire and call options traders were chomping at the bit to get in on the run on Monday.7 Stocks That Will Drop by 10% or More This QuarterDriving AMD's latest rally was news that Intel was licensing AMD GPU technology.According to Kyle Bennet, editor in chief atHardOCP:""Intel is licensing AMD GPU technology. No money has changed hands yet, so there is no financial impact till late in the year, hence nothing in the current earnings report. The first product AMD is working on for Intel is a Kaby Lake processor variant … It is scheduled to come to market before the end of the year. I would expect more collaboration between AMD and Intel in the future on the graphics side.""If true, the Intel collaboration would be huge for AMD, potentially giving the company a leg up on its main GPU competitor,Nvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA). AMD options traders apparently came to the same conclusion, as more than 670,000 contracts traded on the stock yesterday, with calls accounting for 64% of the day's take.Some of the more aggressive speculators have taken out considerable overhead call positions in the soon-to-expire 10 Feb series, where some 4,700 contacts are open at the $14 strike, with another 2,000-plus at $14.50.Twitter Inc (TWTR)Call speculation continues to ramp up on Twitter heading into Thursday's quarterly report. Analysts are expecting a profit of 12 cents per share from Twitter, butEarningsWhispers.complaces expectations about four cents higher at 16 cents per share. Given yesterday's activity in the options pits, speculative traders are banking on the latter figure.On Monday, TWTR stock saw more than 191,000 contracts change hands, with calls snapping up 62% of the day's take. The most popular 10 Feb strike is the $18 call, where more than 10,000 contracts currently reside. If TWTR's 1.3% premarket gain carries over into the open, these 10 Feb $18 calls will be firmly in the money.Additionally, the $18.50 and $19 strikes have also gained considerable attention, attracting OI of 8,600 and 5,500 contracts, respectively. If this bullish bid turns out to be more than just hype, TWTR could be eyeing $20 before all is said and done.Netflix, Inc. (NFLX)Netflix announced yesterday that I'll have to wait another eight months to watchseason two of ""Stranger Things.""While that's certainly a bit depressing, NFLX short sellers took that negativity to another level in January. The number ofNFLX shares sold short jumped by 5%to 25.2 million shares in the most recent reporting period - or roughly 6% of the stock's total float.Granted, short sellers are probably reacting more to NFLX's recent all-time highs and not the wait for ""Stranger Things.""Apple Inc.'s Ultra Accessory Connector: Don't Panic! (AAPL)Still, it would seem that many shorts are not taking any chances on NFLX going upside down, as call volume has picked up notably in the wake of the spike in short interest. On Monday, volume jumped to 172,000 contracts, with calls making up 58% of the day's take - arriving above average for NFLX.Further evidence that shorts are hedging their bets is the sharp rise in at-the-money NFLX call OI. For instance, more than 7,700 calls are open at the Feb $140 strike, with another 13,200 open at the March $140 strike. In fact, out-of-the-money OI is scarce at this point, with only the March $145 strike (12,700 contracts) holding any meaningful call accumulation.As of this writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace5 Stocks to Buy to Defy a Weak FebruaryThe Top 10 Dow Dividend Stocks for FebruaryThe postTuesday's Vital Data: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

Go Short Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Stock Before Q4 Earnings;2/7/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsNvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA) reports its fourth-quarter earnings after Thursday's close. Wall Street expects profits to more than double to 84 cents per share, and revenues to balloon by 50% to $2.11 billion. However, while the top and bottom lines continue to grow, the price of NVDA stock has risen exponentially faster.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockIn fact, it has become a case of too far, too fast for NVDA. So unless the graphics chip specialist has an absolutely blow-out quarter, I look for Nvidia stock to have difficulty moving appreciably higher.Nvidia was one of the best performing stocks of 2016, gaining almost 225%. Importantly, though, the price-to-earnings multiple expanded at a much faster rate, fueling much of the rally, and now stands at its highest level of the past five years.NVDA stock is shaping up as a battle between momentum and value.A look at the price-to-sales metric paints an even more euphoric picture of Nvidia's valuation. The 11.6 ratio is 5.8 times that of the S&P 500 - and the S&P 500 is trading at a historically rich ratio.7 Stocks That Will Drop by 10% or More This QuarterNVDA stock is priced for perfection indeed.Peer group analysis reaffirms the extreme valuation multiples for NVDA. On every metric - earnings, book, sales, cash flow and yield - Nvidia stock is trading at a huge premium to its peers, the market and also its own five-year averages.Many analysts are voicing valuation concerns as well.Brian Algerof Roth Capital Partners just lowered his rating to ""Neutral"" from ""Buy"" and gives the stock a price target of just $120 - while that's a big upgrade from $95, it's only a couple percent higher from here. BMO Capital Markets and Susquehanna also have ""Neutral"" ratings on NVDA stock with price targets well below Monday's $117.31 closing price.NVDA Stock ChartsClick to EnlargeFrom a technical analysis perspective, NVDA stock is trading right at the all-time highs following an explosive 15% rally since bottoming on Jan. 18.With earnings looming Thursday, it will be interesting to see how the stock reacts at such a critical juncture.As I mentioned earlier, NVDA boils down to the classic momentum-versus-value argument. So far, the momentum camp has been the clear winner, with stock performance and valuations both reaching extremes.Inmy previous postonFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB), I argued that it would take a huge beat to propel FB higher based on valuation. Facebook reported a big beat, yet the stock still fell.Similarly with Nvidia, I think you could see a case of an earnings beat and a tepid reaction in NVDA stock.Can General Motors Company (GM) Stock FINALLY Get Some Love?Implied volatility (IV) is ridiculously cheap in front of earnings, trading at only 21% IV, so option buying strategies are favored.How to Trade Nvidia Stock HereBuy NVDA 10 Feb $132 puts and sell NVDA 10 Feb $130 puts for a 70 cents net debit.Maximum loss of the trade is $70 per spread with a maximum gain of $130 per spread. Return on risk is 185%.Ideally, NVDA stock closes below $130 on expiration for the maximum gain.As of this writing, Tim Biggam did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Apple Inc.’s Ultra Accessory Connector: Don’t Panic! (AAPL);2/7/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOne of the biggest PR headaches forApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) is connectors. Last year, the company ditched the 3.5 mm headphone jack on the iPhone 7, then eliminated virtually every legacy port in favor of USB-C on the new MacBook Pro. Those moves required a slew of dongles, adapters and connectors, generating a litany of complaints.makeArticleAd();Source: AmazonWhen news broke yesterday that the company was adding support for a new Ultra Accessory Connector - or UAC - panic ensued. Smaller than either USB-C or Lightning, speculation that AAPL might be preparing to switch to UAC quickly spread.Apple fans (and accessory makers) can take a deep breath. AAPL has confirmed Ultra Accessory Connector is the new name for an old standard, and it's adding UAC to its MFi (Made-for-iPhone) program at the request of headphone manufacturers.The Ultra Accessory ConnectorSpeculation that AAPL might surprise everyone with a new Apple port began with a9to5Macreport. The site uncovered a developer preview withsupport for a new Ultra Accessory Connectorthat ""in some cases will replace the use of Lightning and USB connectors."" UAC is smaller than both USB-C and Apple's own Lightning port.Naturally, given AAPL's laser focus on making its devices thinner, that rapidly ramped up speculation the company could be preparing to move the iPhone and iPad to UAC from Lightning.7 Tech Stocks With Explosive Growth PotentialThe Vergewas quick to chase down the UAC story. According to its sources, the Ultra Accessory Connectoris not part of a plan to introduce a new Apple port. Instead, it's the official name for an old connector that has been in use by various companies. For example,Nikon Corp (ADR)(OTCMKTS:NINOY) uses it as a connectivity option with digital cameras.The Vergesays that headphone manufacturers asked AAPL to add support for the Ultra Accessory Connector in its MFi program.Why the Panic Over UAC?AAPL has gained a reputation for ditching existing ports for new versions, especially when that new Apple port is smaller, letting it shrink its devices. AAPL fans have been particularly riled up over the last six months. First came the decision to eliminate the 3.5 mm headphone jack in the iPhone 7 in favor of Lightning or wireless headphones.Next, when Apple released the long-awaited new MacBook Pro, it replaced all legacy ports with the new USB-C. Those decisions have meant the expense and inconvenience of dongles and adapters to make old accessories work.And in 2012, AAPL created the mother of all headacheswhen it switched from the Dock Connectorit had used since the launch of the iPod, to the Lightning Port. That move let Apple make the iPhone thinner, but made a decade worth of speakers, chargers and other accessories incompatible with the new generation of devices. Manufacturers had to revamp their product lines to incorporate the new Apple port and consumers fumed.Xiaomi Was Going to Rival Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock -- What Happened?So you can understand the concern when news of the Ultra Accessory Connector leaked.UAC Is a Ripple Effect From the iPhone 7 Headphone JackAt this point, it looks as though the Ultra Accessory Connector is just the latest aftershock from that controversial decision to kill the headphone jack with the iPhone 7. While many iPhone buyers are shrugging and simplygoing wireless, there is still demand for wired headphones.And even wireless needs to plug intosomethingto recharge. A growing number of manufacturers are offering USB-C headphones, but that means the cable is incompatible with those Lightning-equipped iOS devices. AsThe Vergepoints out, having AAPL support the Ultra Accessory Connector lets those companies stick a  Lightning-to-UAC and USB-C-to-UAC dongle with their headphones to keepeveryonehappy … except the people who hate dongles.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceApple Inc.

Did Intel Corporation Just Reveal That It Will Be Inside of the Apple Inc. iPhone 8?;2/7/2017;"OnIntel's(NASDAQ: INTC) most recent earnings call, CFO Robert Swan   provided some insight into the company's gross profit margin   guidance for the full year of 2017.Intel guided to full-year gross profit margin of 62% on a GAAP   basis for 2017 -- a 110 basis point (1.1%) improvement from the   60.9% gross profit margin that it reported for 2016.A pair of Apple iPhones. Image source: Apple.makeArticleAd();Interestingly, Intel tells investors to expect gross profit   margin of 62% in the first quarter of 2017, which suggests that   the company isn't expecting margins to improve throughout the   year. This is a little bit surprising, as Intel usually enjoys   the benefit of revenue leverage during the second half of any   given year relative to the first half, since industrywide   personal computer sales tend to be higher in the second half of   the year compared to the first.Swan explained what's going on, and from that explanation, the   chipmaker appears to be betting on having won cellular modem   orders for the next-generationApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) iPhone.The CFO speaksSwan said that ""headwinds"" to the company's gross profit   margin in 2017 compared to 2016 will come in the form of   increased non-volatile memory product sales, as well as from   modem sales. The executive was quick to explain that   increased memory and modem sales lead to ""good growth, increasing   profitability, [and] good earnings."" That said, he also conceded   that those products carry lower gross profit margins than the   rest of the company's business.The way to think about it is this: It's generally better for a   company to sell $100 worth of product at 60% gross profit marginand$30 worth of product at 30% gross profit margin -- diluting the   average gross profit margin percentage to 53% -- than to just   sell the $100 worth of product at 60% gross profit margin,   assuming all else is equal.What does this have to do with the iPhone 8?Circling back to the topic at hand, let's go over why this   commentary might suggest that Intel is inside the next   iPhone.If we look at the trend in Intel's cellular modem revenue, we   see that the company saw an initial ramp-up of shipments during   its third quarter, with sales accelerating in the fourth quarter.   This is consistent with Apple's iPhone ramp-up plans: it builds a   bunch of phones in anticipation of the launch, sells even more   phones in the quarter following the launch, and then it sees   iPhone sales cool off in the following quarters -- until the   cycle begins anew.If Intel doesn't expect to be in the next-generation iPhone,   then investors should expect the company to see a substantial   drop in cellular modem revenue during the second half of 2017.   (In this case, Intel would only be shipping modems into older,   discounted iPhone 7 models.)In that case, cellular modemswouldn'tbe a headwind to gross profit margin improvement for Intel during   the second half of 2017 relative to the first half of 2017, since   its cellular modem volumes/revenue would naturally decline --   proving atailwindto average gross profit margin, not aheadwind.It seems likely, then, that Intel expects to be inside of at   least some of Apple's next-generation iPhone models.10 stocks we like better than IntelWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

The Unlikely S&P 500 Rally Is Still Well Intact (Deserved or Not);2/7/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsEDITOR'S NOTE: Sam Collins will return on Feb. 21.makeArticleAd();The bulls may have been firmly in charge of the market on Friday, inspired by a strong employment report for January. As has been the case so many times since December though, the rally lacked follow-through. TheS&P 500'sclose of 2,292.56 yesterday was 4.86 points down from, or 0.21% below, Friday's last trade.And that was more or less the story for theNasdaq Compositeand theDow Jones Industrial Average. The Nasdaq fell 3.21 points to end the session at 5,663.55, while the Dow slumped 19.04 points, or 0.09%., to close at 20,052.42. None of the major indices made their way into new-high territory, though all of them remain within striking distance of record-high levels.Energy stocks were the day's big loser, giving up 0.9% even though crude oil eked out a gain of 0.36% on Monday, to close at $53.20 per barrel; investors were more concerned about the dollar's strength and what it may mean for oil stocks.Schlumberger Limited(NYSE:SLB) did the most damage, with a 1% stumble.At the other end of the spectrum, technology stocks finished the session with a tiny gain of 0.1%.Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) carried the weight there, with a 1% gain of its own.The weakness was broad too. For the NYSE, 59% of its listings lost ground, and 37% advanced The Nasdaq's breadth was similarly bearish, with 60% of its issues losing ground versus 35% of them rising on Monday. Even so, depth - selling volume - was modest. The NYSE's total trade was only 3.11 billion shares, down a bit from Friday's action. The NYSE's and the Nasdaq's bullish/bearish volume ratios essentially mirrored both indices' advancer/decliner ratios.9 Best Cheap Stocks to Buy Now Under $9.99Still, a handful of names overcame marketwide weakness.Hasbro, Inc.(NASDAQ:HAS) was one them. Shares of the toymaker jumped 14% following the company'sfourth quarter earnings reportthat topped expectations.The overall market remains in its tepidly bullish mode, framed as much by horizontal boundaries as it is by rising lows and rising highs. For the S&P 500, that horizontal floor is at 2253. More recently though, the index has found support at a modestly meaningful rising support level, and it remains above the 20-day moving average line.To start the next leg of bullishness though, the S&P 500 will need to clear the 2,301 ceiling where it peaked two weeks ago.Click to EnlargeThe Nasdaq Composite is also knocking on the door of a breakout. Monday's high of 5,668 is right below the high from two weeks ago.Click to EnlargeWhile momentum is bullish, there's no denying stocks are technically overextended and struggling to tack on more gains with any amount of consistency. The S&P 500 is now 6% above the 200-day moving average line after having rallied 10% since the early November low. That's a tough act to follow, particularly this time of year.February is generally a tough month, and even tougher when it's the first February of a four-year Presidential term. The S&P 500 essentially breaks even this month (and then only because it finishes strong following a mid-month lull), and when it's the year after an election, February averages a 1.6% loss.Still, until the indices actually start to break under key technical levels, the undertow has to be considered bullish even if valuations are reaching uncomfortable levels again. The S&P 500 is now valued at a trailing P/E of 21.2.

Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock Is Still Finding Growth;2/7/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMicrosoft Corporation(NYSE:MSFT) used to be a one-trick, maybe two-trick pony less than 10 years ago. My how things have changed.makeArticleAd();Source:Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified)Under founder Bill Gates, DOS and then Windows operating systems were on virtually every computer that wasn't anApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) machine. And that dominance continued unabated until the dotcom bubble burst.It wasn't the ensuing crash that hurt, it was the fact that tech had reached a point of inflection.From then on, it wasn't just about owning a fiber-optic switching company with a triple-digit price-to-earnings ratio. One of the sayings from those heady times was, if it doesn't have a triple digit P/E, it's not worth buying.The crash meant the internet and tech itself was growing up. There was plenty of consolidation that happened after the dotcom crash. Some worked out, some didn't. But it was necessary for companies that were going to survive to find a way to pivot into the new marketplace.9 Best Cheap Stocks to Buy Now Under $9.99It was also around that time that Microsoft was embroiled in a major antitrust case with the U.S. Government. This meant that MSFT had to change on many levels, just to survive. It was crucial to find a way out of this, because most of the government computers were running Windows, and if Microsoft couldn't find a bright path through the case, it may well lose a very lucrative long-term contract.By 2006, Gates was out of day-to-day operations and his No. 2, Steve Ballmer, took over. While he started strong, it wasn't long until it was apparent that doing the same thing a little differently was not going to cut it as technology was expanding rapidly and interconnections were popping among different tech fields.In 2014, the current CEO, Satya Nadella, took the helm and began to completely reorganize the company, shedding unprofitable and unwieldy divisions and focusing on the future of the company. That meant cleaning up the mess created by the acquisition of the mobile phone business ofNokiaand building a robust cloud-based business for both operating systems and for client storage.It certainly helped that he was previously head of MSFT R&D. But some were still skeptical of his approach, especially in the early days, when the new divisions weren't getting much traction and the established businesses were left wanting - remember Windows 8?Now three years into his role, Nadella has gone from potential goat to real hero. And the most recent earnings number prove out his strategy. He has remained focused and disciplined, and it has paid off.Microsoft has committed $1 billion into cybersecurity investment for its services as well as R&D. The company is reporting 600,000 to 700,000 attacks a week, up from about 20,000 just three years ago. But it's not as much the threat as the opportunity. According to tech sitetechemergence.com, there's an artificial intelligence-based cybersecurity market that will be worth $8.3 trillion market by 2035 in the U.S. alone.And given the fact that the U.S. government is one of MSFT stock's biggest clients, security is crucial.Why GoPro Inc (GPRO) Stock Deserves More PatienceGoing hand in hand with this is the impressive growth of Azure, Microsoft's cloud-based operating and storage system.

How Apple, Inc.'s Share Repurchases Are Driving Record Results;2/6/2017;"Many investors don't fully appreciate just how powerfulApple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) share repurchase program is, or how tangible its   benefits are. This is one of (if notthe) most accretive capital return programs out there, simply by   virtue of its size.Most of the time, companies opt to merely offset the dilution   associated with stock-based compensation to employees. But Apple   buys back its stock hand over fist, and the result is a   significant reduction in shares outstanding. Look no further than   Apple's share count since its capital return program started back   in late 2012.makeArticleAd();AAPL Shares Outstandingdata byYCharts.To date, Apple has now cumulatively repurchased an incredible   $143.7 billion in less than five years. That's larger than the   market caps of many mature megacap companies (those worth over   $100 billion). As of right now, Apple's board has authorized $175   billion in share repurchases, and the company provides annual   updates to its capital return program every April.Data source: SEC filings. Chart by author. Calendar quarters     shown.The company has tended to allocate more of its capital return   program toward repurchases, confident that shares are   undervalued. I'd expect the board to do likewise for 2017.Image source: Apple.Record EPS, brought to you by share buybacksApple noted that it set several records last quarter,   including revenue records for many of its most important   businesses. Earnings per share also hit a new all-time quarterly   record of $3.36, despite the fact that net income was down   modestly in dollar terms at $17.9 billion.MetricQ4 2015Q4 2016Net income$18.4 billion$17.9 billionDiluted EPS$3.28$3.36Shares used in diluted EPS5.59 billion5.33 billionData source: SEC filings. Calendar quarters shown.In no uncertain terms, the aggressive share repurchase   activity led to a meaningful reduction in shares outstanding,   which is what allowed Apple to post its highest quarterly EPS   ever. That's what I call earnings accretion. For shareholders, a   record bottom line is as tangible as it gets.Ideally, Apple continues its capital return program with the     same emphasis on share repurchases. But in order to continue at     the same rate, Apple may need to repatriate some cash since it     is now approaching $100 billion in total debt, including     commercial paper and its recent $10 billion bond offering.     Since the capital returns have largely been funded with debt,     and there is a limit to how much debt Apple can take on,     Apple's domestic cash could be the most significant limiting     factor to continued repurchases.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock       tip, it can pay to listen.

Apple, Inc. Is Now Approaching $100 Billion in Debt;2/6/2017;"Just days afterApple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) earnings release last week, the company raised a   cool $10 billion in debt. Like prior bond sales, this one   consisted of numerous tranches with maturities of up to 30 years,   and included both fixed-rate notes as well as some floaters.   There wasn't really much that was notable about the bond offering   itself; it's comparable to the paper that Apple sells every   year.PrincipalFixed or FloatingmakeArticleAd();RateMaturity$500 millionFloating3-month LIBOR plus 8 basis points2019$500 millionFloating3-month LIBOR plus 20 basis points2020$1 billionFloating3-month LIBOR plus 50 basis points2022$500 millionFixed1.55%2019$1 billionFixed1.9%2020$1.5 billionFixed2.5%2022$1.75 billionFixed3%2024$2.25 billionFixed3.35%2027$1 billionFixed4.25%2047Data source: Prospectus.However, it was done a bit earlier the usual this time around,   and Apple is now approaching $100 billion in debt.It's the time of the seasonTypically, Apple conducts these bond offerings shortly after   providing updates to its capital return program, which is usually   alongside its April earnings release. They usually occur in April   or May. But Apple needed to sell the bonds slightly earlier this   year for a few interrelated reasons.Apple Store in Sydney. Image source: Apple.Apple entered into its ninth accelerated share repurchase   program last quarter, and total share repurchases were $11   billion. That took a big bite out of Apple's domestic cash   position, and the company exited the quarter with $15.9 billion   in domestic cash. That's the low end of Apple's comfort zone;   Apple usually keeps its domestic cash in the range of $15 billion   to $25 billion for operational and strategic needs.Note how Apple's domestic cash has dwindled in recent years   due to aggressive capital return activity. (This chart does not   reflect the recent bond offering.)Data source: SEC filings. Chart by author. Calendar quarters     shown.The company simply blew through its domestic dollars a little   faster than usual this year with share repurchases.$100 billion and countingSince debt largely funds Apple's massive capital returns, the   debt load that it has taken on over the past five years is   commensurately large. At the end of 2016, Apple had $87.5 billion   in long-term debt (including the current portion) and commercial   paper, which is just short-term unsecured debt. The recent $10   billion bond offering will now bring that figure up to around   $97.5 billion.The offering was still able to fetch investment-grade credit   ratings, but it goes without saying that the more debt that Apple   takes on over time, the worse its credit rating profile becomes.   Meanwhile, there's been a lot of talk about a potential tax   repatriation holiday from the Trump administration. If Apple is   able to bring home a meaningful chunk of the $230.2 billion that   now sits overseas, it could theoretically extinguish some of that   debt and strengthen the balance sheet. That could effectively   give Apple a few more years to continue its debt-funded capital   return strategy.Until then, Apple will just have to keep selling paper.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Who Are Uber's Biggest Competitors?;2/6/2017;"Uber, the massive, omnipresent ride-sharing company, has dominated the industry since its inception in 2009. It has spread to more than 60 countries since then, and was recently valued at $68 billion, making investors wonder when, and if, Uber willfile for an IPO.The emergence of on-demand rides has become a popular business venture all over the world, but it has proved difficult for companies to break away from the congested pack. At the end of 2015, Sidecar, another on-demand car service, officially stopped offering rides and deliveries.If you're looking to leave controversy-plagued Uber behind-and recently, a lot of people did,rallying behind the #deleteUber hashtagafter a certain executive order from President Trump-but you still want the luxury of on-demand rides, there are increasingly popular alternatives for you.Here's a rundown of the biggest competitors Uber faces:LyftLaunched in 2012, Lyft is a transportation company known for its fuzzy pink mustaches on the front or on dashboards of cars-silly, yet quite helpful when trying to spot your ride.The San Francisco-based company works similarly to Uber. Within its smartphone app, users see a map with a pin at their location, animated cars moving around nearby, an estimate of how far away the nearest ride is, and a big button labeled ""Request Lyft.""Also like Uber, Lyft offers multiple levels of service: Lyft Line (a shared ride option that can save users up to 60% on fare); Plain Lyft (a ride for solo travelers or groups up to four); and Lyft Plus (larger cars and SUVs perfect for those traveling with suitcases and boxes, or if you want to ride with a large group). You can select which type of ride you want with a slider tool at the top of the app.As for rates, they vary by city, type of ride, and current demand; you can also choose to add a tip if desired. It is important to note that like Uber, Lyft does use surge pricing.In the United States, Lyft is available in roughly 220 cities and areas nationwide, as well as nine cities within Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, The Philippines, and Vietnam.CurbFormerly Taxi Magic (2009) and RideCharge (2007), Curb was born in 2014, and is a company that connects people with safe, reliable rides from professional, insured, and fully licensed taxi and other for-hire drivers. Based in Alexandria, Virginia, Curb operates in more than 60 U.S. cities nationwide, partnering with 90 cab companies and driving 35,000 cars.Curb is app-based, opening up to a map that marks your location; it also shows available Curb drivers nearby. Users can either book rides instantly, or schedule them up to 24 hours in advance (a service convenient for travelers). There is a choice of paying fares within the app or with cash in the car, as well as vehicle options to best suit your needs.On its website, Curb boasts that rides are always available and ready to pick you up, as well as messaging that ""all rides begin and end at the curb,"" a motto reflected in its logo.Didi ChuxingConceived from a merger back in 2015, Didi Chuxing is a ride-hailing service company made up of China's two largest taxi-hailing firms: Didi Dache and Kuaidi Dache. Didi Chuxing, formerly known as Didi Kuaidi, is often referred to as the ""Uber of China,"" and virtually owns all of China's taxi-hailing market, with a 99% market share, and 87% market share when it comes it hailing private vehicles.It operates in over 400 cities across the region, versus UberChina's humble 45 cities.In January, the company said it booked 1.43 billion rides in 2015 alone, and completed 200 million rides last December. Didi is also in a strategic partnership with the above mentioned Lyft, which allowed the company to operate in China for the first time.Didi Chuxing is well-funded and backed by tech giants Apple Inc.AAPL, Tencent HoldingsTCEHY, and AlibabaBABA. According to itsCrunchBasepage, the company's total equity funding is valued at $7.32 billion in six funding rounds from 17 investors.Earlier this year, Uber conceded defeat,selling its UberChina operationsto Didi and ending an expensive, bruising battle between the two companies. Uber faced obstacle after obstacle trying to enter China's fast-growing ride-hailing market, losing a total of $2 billion there.GrabFounded in 2011, Grab (formerly known as GrabTaxi) is a ride service company that operates in Southeast Asia, primarily in Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia, and the Philippines. Like Uber, Grab works through an app-based platform for smartphones, and users can download the app on the Google Play store, Apple's App Store, and Blackberry World.Grab has raised a total of $680 million in total equity funding, with roughly 75,000 registered taxi drivers in its network.Their mission is simple. Grab ""aims to revamp these local taxi markets by introducing simple, cost effective mobile-based technology to both the supply (dispatch companies) and demand (passenger) sides of the distribution chain…[their] vision is to revamp the South East Asian taxi industry, making it a safer and more efficient means of transport we can all be proud of.""Announced last December, Grab joined in an alliance with Lyft, Didi, and Ola, India's main ride-hailing company, in order to rival Uber as well as grow beyond its Southeast Asia market.OlaStarted as an online cab aggregator in Mumbai back in 2010, Ola is an app-based transportation company and is one of the fastest growing businesses in India. It has raised $1.23 billion in equity funding through eight rounds from 20 investors.Ola currently has over 40,000 cars in its network across 22 cities.Reserved through its mobile app, the company provides different types of cab services ranging from economic to luxury travel. Ola supports both cash and digital payment options with Ola money. It also recently rolled out two news services: outstation and rental. Outstation allows customers to book a cab two hours in advance for intercity travel, while rental lets customers rent a car on an hourly basis.Like Lyft and Grab, Ola is partnered with Didi Chuxing in what is turning out to be quite the international effort against Uber. Together, the four companies rolled out joint products last year, beginning with Didi riders who, when visiting the U.S., can open their Didi app to hail a Lyft.Stocks that Aren't in the News…YetYou are invited to download the full, up-to-the-minute list of 220 Zacks Rank #1 ""Strong Buys"" free of charge.

Here’s How Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA) Stock Will Gain 25%;2/6/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsShares ofAlibaba Group Holding Ltd(NYSE:BABA) still appear undervalued despite the company already significantly outperforming the market. If you bought stock in Alibaba since the end of December, you're up almost 20%.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockYet, for reasons I will outline, Alibaba stock - thanks to emergence in the cloud and the momentum in its core e-commerce business - can still deliver 25% returns in the next 12 to 18 months.Assessing the Value in Alibaba StockAlibaba shares have risen some 15% year to date, compared with about 2% rise in theS&P 500 Index. Based on fiscal 2018 earnings estimates of $4.30 per share, Alibaba stock is currently priced at a forward price-earnings ratio of roughly 23, which is about in line with the average stock in the S&P 500.And here's the thing: Assuming the company does earn $4.30 per share, that would translate to year-over-year earnings growth of 23%. From my vantage point, Alibaba stock remains one of the better bargains on the market even with its recent rally.In other words, investors still have an opportunity to buy not only into a great growth story, but also diversify their investments by betting on the growth of China's middle class. But Alibaba is more than just a bet on China's recovering economy. The company, which saw a 54% jump inthird-quarter revenue, leading to an impressive 17-cent beat on the bottom line, crushed Wall Street's fiscal estimates on almost every metric.3 Big Buyout Deals That Could Crush InvestorsOften compared toAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) because of their e-commerce similarities, Alibaba founder/executive chairman Jack Ma and CEO Daniel Zhang prove they can do what Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos has shown a knack for: Mash the profit-margin accelerator whenever he feels like it and when the market least expects it. And as with Amazon, Alibaba's cloud platform Alicloud (which posted a 115% year-over-year jump in revenue) has become a force.Not only is Alibaba enjoying an increase in the number of paying customers, the customers are also spending higher than usual. All told, the company's strong revenue growth, driven by its diversified technological and data strategy continues to pay off. And with the company boosting its 2017 fiscal year revenue growth guidance from 48% to 53%, Alibaba is showing no signs of slowing down.Bottom Line for Alibaba StockWith cloud revenues beginning to take a bigger portion of the business, combined with the strength in its core e-commerce operation, BABA has tons of room to run.Here's How Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Can Hit $200As such, while I'm not willing to suggest BABA deserves the same respect as Amazon, which is priced at a forward P/E of 63, Alibaba should command a P/E of 30, which puts Alibaba stock at around $130, delivering almost 25% to 30% in the next year-and-a-half or so.As of this writing, Richard Saintvilus did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace9 Best Cheap Stocks to Buy Now Under $9.997 Tech Stocks With Explosive Growth PotentialThe postHere's How Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA) Stock Will Gain 25%appeared first onInvestorPlace."

3 Stocks That Turned $5,000 into $10,000 or More in Just 3 Years;2/6/2017;"Smart investors know the stock market is a long term game, and   trying to seek out companies that can double your money in just a   few years time is a fool's errand. Anything can happen in the   short run to upset the best laid plans, but over the longer term,   the cream will rise to the top and the best companies will   shine.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();Still, sometimes top stocks also perform remarkably well for   investors in the near term. Here are three examples of companies   that have doubled investors money -- not over five, 10, or 20   years, but in just three years time! $5,000 invested in these   stocks in 2014 would be worth $10,000 or more today. That's a   result few investments are able to replicate.Moreover, these aren't super-riskypenny stocks, but rather members of theS&P 500index, meaning they're among the biggest companies on the market   today.1. Ulta SalonBeauty care and products are fashion statements, and no   cosmetics company has made a bigger or bolder statement in recent   years thanUlta Salon(NASDAQ: ULTA) , which sells more than 20,000 products from 500   vendors at almost 1,000 stores. It has become the industry leader   not just because it sells more stuff than the competition, but   because it combines a broad selection of products in a unique   salon environment that can't be easily replicated, especially by   online retailers.While e-commerce has drained market share from any number of   bricks-and-mortar retailers, causing them to close stores and   shrink their square footage, Ulta brashly proclaims it will   maintain its breakneck expansion pace. By the time it reports its   fourth-quarter earnings, it will have opened 100 net new stores   in 2016 and grown its square footage by 11% over the prior   year.Image source: Ulta Salon.Cosmetics is certainly a crowded space, and consumers can   purchase cheaper products from their local drugstores. The allure   of the space has even tempted fast-fashion leaderH&Mto enter the market with its own discounted line. But when   it comes to personal beauty care, consumers are increasingly   unwilling to skimp on quality, and Ulta Salon's business   model of selling them in a salon setting where professional   beauty care specialists can provide instant advice and feedback   is one reason it has generated returns totaling nearly 217% over   the past three years.2. BroadcomTheBroadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO) of today isn't the fabless semiconductor company   of years past. In 2016, it was acquired by Singapore-based Avago   Technologies for $37 billion, which renamed itself Broadcom   Limited, but to spice things up kept the AVGO ticker symbol. Once   the merger was complete, it sold its entire Internet of Things   portfolio of products toCypress Semiconductorfor $550 million. Today, the resulting company describes itself   as ""a leading designer, developer and global supplier of a broad   range of digital and analog semiconductor connectivity solutions   that serve the wired infrastructure, wireless communications,   enterprise storage and industrial markets."" A full plate, to be   sure.Image source: Getty Images.Yet theReader's Digestversion of that is Broadcom is primarily a supplier of chips to   smartphone and tablet producers,especiallyApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) , which accounts for more than 10% of its sales,   but also likelySamsung, which helps explain why its stock has done so well over the   past few years.Since 2014, Broadcom's stock has returned more than 276%,   meaning a $5,000 investment then would now be valued at almost   $14,000, a near three-bagger.Its success in the mobile market -- the company is generating   revenues of $13 billion annually -- meant that it could afford to   sell off a small business like its IoT portfolio (which made less   than $200 million) without thinking twice, even as its rivals are   racing headlong into the space. Being a key supplier to the   mobile market should allow it to continue generating big   returns.3. NVIDIAUlta and Broadcom may have done well for investors over the   past few years, but their gains pale in comparison to the returnsNVIDIA(NASDAQ: NVDA) has generated. Rising about 600% in value since   2014, the graphics chipmaker would have turned a $5,000   investment into about $35,000.Image source: Getty Images.NVIDIA was able to post such remarkable results because it has   its finger on the pulse ofall the technologiesthat are driving into the future in sixth gear. From   artificial intelligence and self-driving cars to augmented and   virtual reality -- not to mention its bread-and-butter gaming   markets, which almost all the other advances are tying into --   NVIDIA is making the chips that power the newest devices.We'll be seeing soon how its fourth quarter played out, but if   it continues to follow the pattern from its third quarter, it   will be one to look forward to. Last quarter, NVIDIA revenues   surged 54% year over year to $2 billion, and the company   predicted it would grow another 50% in Q4. Analysts who were   caught flat-footed by how will the third quarter played out have   upped their forecasts for an equally robust consensus view of the   fourth.While its three-year results have been impressive, most of the   gains came in the last year, and a stock that rises so far so   fast can be ripe for a correction. Not that it won't continue   higher, but if it takes a pause before it soars once again,   investors probably shouldn't be surprised. And grow it should,   since industry analysts see the A.I., V.R., and driverless car   markets becoming huge in the near future.10 stocks we like better than NvidiaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Twilio Inc (TWLO) Q4 Earnings Preview;2/6/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTo sayTwilio Inc(NYSE:TWLO) has taken investors on something of a roller coaster ride over the course the past eight months would be a considerable understatement. Twilio stock rallied from its June IPO price of $15 to a high near $71 by September, only to peel back to a low of less than $26 in January.makeArticleAd();Source:Web Summit Via FlickrSince hitting that low, TWLO stock has gained more than 20% … right in front of the Twilio earnings report due after Tuesday's close.The conundrum: Twilio has yet to trade based on any semblance of ""value."" It has been and continues to be driven by a perception of potential, and that perception is altered on a pretty regular basis. Hence the big swings in just a few short months.The good news is, Tuesday's Q4 earnings report will likely answer some of the question that investors have been asking about the company's future.The bad news is, owners of Twilio stock may not like those answers.Twilio Q4 Earnings PreviewTwilio, for those not familiar with it, has turned cloud computing technologies into a robust telephony and messaging tool. Anything an individual business could want to do with, or through, a smartphone or app, TWLO can make it happen securely, en masse, via the cloud.9 Best Cheap Stocks to Buy Now Under $9.99It's a relatively young company, too. Twilio has only been in business since 2013, and a publicly traded company since the middle of last year.Revenue growth hasn't been a problem at any point, though. For the quarter ending in September, the top line of $71.5 million was up 61% on a year-over-year basis, and estimates for a top line of $74.2 million are 44% better than Q4 2015's sales.What has been a sore spot, though, is earnings - or a lack thereof. Twilio isn't profitable, and isn't expected to be anytime soon. Analysts anticipate a loss of 5 cents per share on Tuesday, though that would be a slight improvement on the 10-cent loss booked in the same quarter a year earlier.3 Things TWLO Stock Holders Need to Chew OnClearly Twilio stock is still a story stock, rocked more by rhetoric and assumption than by actual results. Results - relative results - will set the tone for the rhetoric, though, and that rhetoric will largely be shaped by three overarching ideas.In no particular order …An 'Even If' Valuation:The market is mostly OK with the lack of earnings thus far, and the unlikelihood of a swing to a profit in the foreseeable future. As was noted, the story aspect of this company has been more than compelling enough to keep trades interested.They're becoming increasingly suspicious, however, that even if Twilio were to turn a typical 10% profit on its revenue, the valuation still makes no sense. At its current annual revenue run rate of $290 million, $29 million worth of income still doesn't make sense of the company's current market cap of $2.8 billion.Its Relationship With Facebook:The Twilio platform integrates (quite nicely) with Messenger and WhatsApp, fromFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB), which accounts for roughly a fourth of the company's revenue now thatMessenger was added to the mix last year. But that's not guaranteed revenue going forward.As Pacific Crest Securities analyst Brendan Barnicleobserved following the Q2 Twilio earnings report:""Variable revenue ($8.1 million) was down 14% sequentially and dropped to 12.6% of revenue from 16%. While some investors may worry about the decline, we believe that it largely reflects the lumpiness of revenue from WhatsApp, Twilio's largest customer and the main component of variable revenue.""Slowing Growth/Outlook:As was noted, traders had been willing to pay a premium for TWLO stock because its red-hot growth rate presumably would catch up with the stock's valuation, and even spur a profit. The anticipated top line for its fourth quarter is barely better than its Q3 revenue, and even analysts that expect a top-line beat aren't looking for a big one - only about $3 million.Here's How Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Can Hit $200To that end, Twilio needs to serve up some plausible Q1 and full-year (2017) revenue guidance that's better than the current figures of $77.85 million and $352.6 million, respectively.Bottom Line for Twilio StockThough TWLO shares may finally look like they're on the mend after paying the usual post-IPO price - a major setback - between September and December, it's still a bit too soon to make such an assumption. The rally since early January may still be nothing more than a relief rally in the wake of amajor inflow of new TWLO stock that had been tied up until December 22nd.The pressure remains on the company to prove its worth. Tuesday's report will either do so, or it won't, and it looks to be a 50/50 proposition at this time.Look for fireworks either way.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceWhy Valeant Pharmaceuticals Intl Inc (VRX) Stock Will Finally StabilizeAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc.

Why Fitbit Inc (FIT) Needs to Sell Itself, But Probably Won’t;2/6/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsLess than two years after clearing $50,Fitbit Inc(NYSE:FIT) stock trades around $6. A series of disastrous earnings reports has sent Fitbit stock tumbling. The most recent was the disclosure of preliminary Q4 results last week, which imply a nearly 20% decline in sales year-over-year in the key holiday quarter.makeArticleAd();Source:Via FitbitCompetition fromApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL),Samsung Electronics Co Ltd(OTCMKTS:SSNLF), andGarmin Ltd.(NASDAQ:GRMN), among others, appears to be a key problem for the company, particularly in the U.S. The resulting decline in growth has had a substantially negative effect on FIT stock.That's not going to get better.Lately, Fitbit has been compared toGoPro Inc(NASDAQ:GPRO), another company that drove explosive growth mostly off a single product only to see sales nosedive. The question is whether in this day and age, a single-product company can support the expense necessary to compete with behemoths like Apple and Samsung. The answer, at least from Fitbit and GPRO, appears to be no.And that would seem to argue for a sale of FIT to one of those larger players. The problem for Fitbit stock investors, however, is that such a move seems unlikely - at least before it's too late.Why FIT Should Sell ItselfIn response to the lower demand in Q4, FIT is cutting costs. It's laying off 6% of its staff, part of an overall effort to cut $200 million a year in operating expense. That's a substantial amount of savings, given that Fitbit stock has a market cap under $1.4 billion at the moment.7 Stocks to Sell as Fear Returns to the MarketBut what's less important than what is being saved is what's left: some $850 million in fiscal 2017, according to the company. It's a huge amount of money for what, at its core, still is a single-product company. Yes, FIT is adding software to create a ""platform"", and its product line goes beyond its most popular wearable. But compared to the diversification of an Apple or a Samsung, there's no comparison.Fitbit has to build an expense base to support one product; its competitors (even Garmin) support multiple products. That matters not only in terms of cost, but in terms of sales. It's easier for Apple to cajoleBest Buy Co Inc(NYSE:BBY) to push the Apple Watch when Best Buy is also selling millions of dollars' worth of MacBooks and iPhones. FIT doesn't have that leverage, and expecting it to compete with electronics giants seems simply foolhardy.As for the cost structure, even with the $200 million in reduced spend, FIT is guiding for a loss next year. (That loss excludes the cost of stock grants issued to Fitbit executives, no less.) With one product, there's no ability to spread out expense for everything from salespeople to R&D to IT. FIT is likely going to spend $240 million in 2016 just on sales and marketing - for one product!That expense rose 23% through the first three quarters - the cost of trying to be David against multiple Goliaths. But the story seems likely to end much more poorly for Fitbit stock.Why Fitbit Stock Won't Sell ItselfFrom that standpoint, a sale of FIT stock to a larger player would seem to make sense. Apple, Samsung or Garmin all would make sense. The Fitbit brand remains strong, and an acquirer almost certainly could cut hundreds of millions of dollars itself. A slimmer (pardon the pun) FIT would thus add a nice amount of profit, even assuming a premium paid to acquire Fitbit stock.There are a couple of problems with this scenario. The first is that Fitbit stock has a dual-class system. FIT is thus controlled basically by its two founders and venture capital firm True Ventures. One of those founders, CEO James Park,saidin the release accompanying the preliminary fourth-quarter figures that the company simply was in ""a temporary slowdown and transition period"".As long as Park, along with True Ventures and co-founder Eric Friedman, believe the weakness is only temporary, Fitbit won't sell itself. And if Park is wrong, and Fitbit is surpassed by larger players, by then, it will likely be too late.3 Reasons Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Is Much More Than Its Main PlatformAnother issue, counterintuitively, is FIT's huge cash balance. The company expects to have $700 million in cash at the end of Q4 - over half of its market capitalization. But that cash also limits the premium an acquirer will pay for Fitbit stock. The enterprise value at the moment - what the market says the business is worth - is about $670 million. Assuming Fitbit could get twice that price from an acquirer, it would have to sell itself for only about $9.30 per share.So hopes of a FIT acquisition rest, essentially, on the co-founders of the company agreeing to sell the business for more than 80% less than it was worth less than two years ago. That's a highly unlikely outcome. Park and Friedman are going to believe Fitbit can turn around - it'stheircompany. They turned their idea into a business worth over $10 billion not that long ago; it's silly to think they would then sell it for a bit over $1 billion at this point.And maybe FIT can turn itself around, which would certainly drive upside in Fitbit stock. But it seems a very difficult path. While it's hard to think of a billion-dollar company as a ""little guy,"" Fitbit is a little guy when compared to its competition. And in this day and age, it's awful tough for the little guy to go at it alone.As of this writing, Vince Martin did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceThe Top 10 Dow Dividend Stocks for February10 Blue-Chip Stocks That Could Be Holding You BackThe postWhy Fitbit Inc (FIT) Needs to Sell Itself, But Probably Won'tappeared first onInvestorPlace."

But that's not the case. While theiShares Nasdaq Biotechnology Index (ETF)(NASDAQ:IBB) rose on the news, beaten-down shares ofValeant Pharmaceuticals Intl Inc(NYSE:VRX) plumbed yearly lows.makeArticleAd();Source:Wikimedia (Modified)When Valeant reports quarterly earnings on Feb. 28, will VRX stock finally rebound?A month is a long time for Valeant shareholders. The market will judge, in advance, sales growth from the Salix unit. Xifaxan sales rose from $220 million to $273 million year-over-year in the third quarter. That is above an annualized $1 billion in sales, but VRX will need sales growing at an even faster rate. Salix bolstered its sales team. The company said it would loosen its budget to allow for higher advertising spending.Asset Sales IgnoredBuying of VRX stock picked up when rumors circulated it would sell Salix or B+L. When the CEO sold non-core assets, including its skin division, at a price of 7 times sales, the stock rallied, but then slumped.Investors want to see a multibillion-dollar sale now. Unfortunately, a sale of that size not only takes time but needs a healthy premium attached. By cutting operating expenses, raising research and development spend, and advertising more, Salix and B+L will reverse their sales slump.5 Trump-Proof Pharma Dividend Stocks to BuyIn November, 2016, Valeantsaid:""Our divestitures program is expected to allow us to reduce our quantum of debt further.

Is Fitbit Inc. a Bear Trap or Bull Trap?;2/6/2017;"Shares ofFitbit(NYSE: FIT) recently fell to an all-time low after the fitness   tracker maker released dismal fourth quarter preliminary earnings   and bleak guidance for fiscal 2017. The company now expects its   fourth quarter revenue to fall 18%-20% annually, missing its   prior guidance for 4% growth and representing its first   year-over-year decline since its IPO.Image source: Fitbit.makeArticleAd();On the bottom line, it expects a non-GAAP net loss of   $0.51-$0.56 per share, compared to its prior guidance for a   profit of $0.14-$0.18 per share. That's a big drop from its   profit of $0.35 in the year-ago quarter, and represents its first   unprofitable quarter. Fitbit says it sold 6.5 million devices   during the quarter, which represents a 21% decline from a year   earlier. Non-GAAP gross margin is also expected to be ""materially   below"" its prior forecast of 46%, which already represented an   all-time low.And that pain won't end anytime soon. Fitbit expects to   generate just $1.5-$1.7 billion in revenues in fiscal 2017, which   would represent a 26% decline (at the midpoint) and miss the   consensus estimate of $2.4 billion. It will also remain in the   red with a non-GAAP net loss of $0.22-$0.44 for the year, well   below expectations for a profit of $0.64. Lastly, it announced   that it would lay off 110 employees, or 6% of its workforce, to   reduce its operating expenses.With numbers this bad, it's easy to hate this stock. But some   contrarian investors might also argue that the stock has fallen   too fast and too far. Let's take a closer look at the bullish and   bearish cases for Fitbit, and see why it could burn both   sides.Why Fitbit could be a bear trapFitbit has been averypopular target for short sellers over the past year. As of this   writing, 43% of its shares are being shorted. But when short   interest is that high,anypositive news about Fitbit -- a new product, aggressive cost   cutting measures, or acquisition buzz -- could trigger a short   squeeze.With an enterprise value of $680 million and an EV-to-sales   ratio of just 0.3, Fitbit is very cheap. That makes it a   lucrative buyout target forApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) ,Garmin(NASDAQ: GRMN) , or other companies looking to expand into the   wearables market. By buying Fitbit, Apple could expand its   wearables reach beyond the Apple Watch,which failedto turn smartwatches into mainstream gadgets. Garmin could buy   Fitbit to broaden its fitness tracker portfolio and further   diversify its business away from its weaker automotive GPS   unit.Image source: Fitbit.Fitbit has also been diversifying its business with mobile   payments and  its acquisitions of Pebble's assets and   Vector's smartwatches -- indicating that it could soon create   feature-rich smartwatches tethered to an app ecosystem. That   ecosystem could bolster Fitbit's user loyalty figures while   diversifying its top line. It could also sign more corporate   wellness partnerships to secure more bulk enterprise orders.   Fitbit expects its financial performance to ""stabilize"" in the   second half of 2017 as it reduces its operating expenses   (especially sales and marketing) by $200 million -- so the stock   could bottom out soon.Why Fitbit could be a bull trapHowever, the numbers all suggest that Fitbit is still   struggling to carve out a niche between low-end rivals likeXiaomi, sports performance challengers like Garmin, and high-end   smartwatch makers like Apple. Fitbit is still the largest   wearables maker in the world with 23% market share, according to   research firm  IDC. But its market share rose just 1.6   percentage points between the third quarters of 2015 and   2016.That topped Xiaomi, Garmin, and Apple's year-over-year growth,   but it didn't outpace the growth of the ""others"" category --   which grew from 37% to 45%. This indicates that the market is   becoming saturated with smaller players, which could drive down   price expectations.Meanwhile, downsizing in the face of fierce competition is   rarely a winning strategy. By reducing its sales and marketing   spend, Fitbit could be marginalized by other wearables makers   throughout the year. A 6% workforce reduction also might not be   enough to strengthen its bottom line growth. Looking ahead,   Fitbit will likely acquire additional companies in a desperate   bid for growth, but inadvertently ""diworsify"" its business   instead.My verdict: It's a bull trapFitbit looks undervalued, but its disastrous fourth quarter   numbers indicate that its core business model is crumbling, and   that mainstream demand for wearables hasn't been as robust as   analysts had predicted. I believe that investors should stay far   away from this fading stock, but I'll still keep an eye out for a   silver lining when it reports its full fourth-quarter earnings on   Feb. 22.10 stocks we like better than FitbitWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Here’s How Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Can Hit $200;2/6/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) delivered excellent earnings news Jan. 31 that pushed Apple stock to its highest level since the summer of 2015.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockThat's great news for long time owners of Apple stock who've had to suffer through a deluge of naysayers proclaiming its lack of innovation. More than a few have even suggestedinvestors dump AAPL stockand buyMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) stock in its place.Hey, I like Microsoft and I think what it'sdoing in the cloudis going to help it continue to grow over the next decade, but it's not in the same league when it comes to revenue and profit growth. Microsoft does, however, have a business model that's transitioning from one-time product sales to ongoing monthly recurring revenue, something many observers have noted is happening at Apple.Yes, Apple did sell more than78 millioniPhones in the first quarter, roughly five million more than it sold in the same quarter a year earlier, but it was the service revenue that had everyone in a tizzy.Jim Cramer likened the Apple business model tothe Gillette business model, where consumers buy a single razor and keep buying new razor blades; only in Apple's situation the iPhone is the razor and services such as the App Stores are the razor blades.You gotta love recurring revenue. Cramer does:""What has dogged Apple's stock for ages, what has kept its share price so low, at least in terms of its valuation, is the 'Blackberry-ization' issue,"" Cramer said onMad MoneyFeb. 1. ""The notion that in the end, the iPhone is just a device and device companies eventually get wasted asBlackBerry Ltd(NASDAQ:BBRY) did.""7 Tech Stocks With Explosive Growth PotentialThere's no question recurring revenue is good for a company's top and bottom line and should be welcome news for owners of Apple stock, but is it enough to drive Apple stock through its all-time high of $134.54 and upward to $200?That's debatable.While Apple's services revenue hit$7.2 billionin the first quarter, 18% higher than a year earlier, it's still only 9% of the company's overall revenue, or 100 basis points higher than a year earlier.By comparison, Microsoft's second quarter saw its service and other revenueincreased 29.7% to $7.5 billion. The only problem with that for Microsoft is the gross margins are 40% compared to 67.5% for its product revenue, which accounted for 68.5% of its overall revenue.You want your recurring revenue gross margins to be higher than your product margins, not lower; because if that's the way the world is headed, both stocks are looking at lower profits in the future.Apple doesn't break down its gross margins between products and segments. Overall, its gross margin in Q1 2017 was 38.5%, 160 basis points less than in Q1 2016. Microsoft's overall gross margin in its latest quarter was 58.9%, considerably higher than Apple's.That would seem to suggest Microsoft's in a better position when it comes to service revenue. It is both growing this aspect of its business faster than Apple and making more from every dollar of revenue. From this perspective, Apple is doomed.A quick look farther down the income statement, however, provides some clarity: Apple's operating margin in Q1 2017 was 29.9%; Microsoft's Q2 2017 operating margin was 25.7%, or 420 basis points less than Apple.The biggest reason for this difference: Microsoft spends about three times as much per year on research and development as Apple does; Apple spent 4.7% of its revenue in the trailing 12 months on R&D compared to 14.4% for Microsoft. And when you're talking about billions of dollars of annual revenue, the difference adds up quickly.Which brings us back to Apple's growing service revenue: InvestorPlace contributor Brad Moon highlightedthe positives of Apple's services revenuerecently. A couple of his points stick out for me.Don't Bet Against the Dow Jones Industrial AverageFirst, the App Store had $3 billion in revenue in December - a record. Secondly, Apple paid out more than $20 billion to developers in 2016. Extrapolate December's App Store sales over 12 months and you get $36 billion in revenue. Subtract $20 billion paid to developers in 2016 and that leaves a gross profit of $16 billion and a gross margin of 44%, which is pretty darn healthy considering very little R&D is required to keep that up and running.Can recurring revenue take Apple stock to $200? I believe it can. When, however, is another story.As of this writing, Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace3 Big Buyout Deals That Could Crush Investors9 Best Cheap Stocks to Buy Now Under $9.99The postHere's How Apple Inc.

Xiaomi Was Going to Rival Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock — What Happened?;2/6/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOnly a few years ago,Xiaomiwas worryingApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) investors. Xiaomi had become the world's third-largest smartphone manufacturer and was expanding into other products like fitness trackers, TVs and video streamers. It was valued at $45 billion, hired a prominent executive away fromAlphabet Inc's(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google and planned an expansion into America.makeArticleAd();Source: XiaomiToday? It has dropped out of the top five smartphone vendors list, marketshare in China has plummeted, the Google exec has jumped ship and some analysts are valuing the company as low as $3.6 billion.What happened to Xiaomi and is its threat to Apple truly neutralized? Or are the troubled Chinese tech giant's plans merely on hold?Xiaomi's Rapid RisePrivately held Xiaomi was founded in 2010, released its first smartphone in 2011 and rapidly gained popularity in China. The company offered high-quality in its smartphones, with low pricing -a combination that led to it being the top-selling smartphone brand in China by 2014.It came seemingly out of nowhere to capture thethird place spot for worldwide smartphone salesthat year as well. The feat was especially impressive given that Xiaomi was not selling its phones in the U.S. market.9 Best Cheap Stocks to Buy Now Under $9.99Like Apple, Google andSamsung Electronics Co Ltd(OTCMKTS:SSNLF), the company wanted to expand into consumer electronics in general. That effort included the inexpensive Mi Band fitness tracker that vaulted Xiaomi intosecond place worldwide for wearable salesby 2015, behind onlyFitbit Inc(NYSE:FIT).The company pursued a strategy of investing in hardware startups, buying into dozens of companies making everything from smart lighting to headphones and TVs. While these products are not always Xiaomi-branded, they are designed to all work well together.It also added software and services to the mix.Chinese CompetitionThe success of Xiaomi spurred homegrown competition. Other Chinese manufacturers stepped up to the plate and followed Xiaomi's formula. However, they did a better job of marketing to increasingly demanding Chinese consumers by charging a little more but offering more striking designs. One of these companies -Huawei- was good enough that Googlepartnered with it to build the Nexus 6P smartphone in 2015. Xiaomi's phones seem lower quality than these competitors and rather than innovative, its designs are often seen as being too similar to Apple's.At this point, Xiaomi has been leapfrogged by its Chinese smartphone rivals. While Xiaomi has dropped off the global top five smartphone manufacturer list, China's Huawei,OppoandVivocurrently hold the third, fourth and fifth places.American ObstaclesKey to Xiaomi's ambitions were an expansion into the U.S. market. To lead that effort, thecompany hired Hugo Barra- the VP who oversaw Android product management - from Google.However, Xiaomi's U.S. push has failed to materialize. There are dozens of products Xiaomi offers online through itsMi Store(which carries only a fraction of Xiaomi's and its partner companies' gear), including eight different smartphone models, multiple smart TVs, VR headsets and even a self-balancing electric scooter. U.S. customers are limited to being able to buy a few sets of earbuds, a pair of headphones, a battery pack and a Bluetooth speaker.A big part of the problem in moving into the U.S. market is that Xiaomi has taken advantage of China's relatively lax approach to patents. In late 2014, it wasbanned from selling smartphones in Indiaas a result of a patent infringement ruling (it has since resumed Indian operations). If Xiaomi tried to push into the U.S. with its smartphones at this point, there's a good chance Apple and other tech companies would sue it into oblivion.In an attempt to defend against this scenario, Xiaomi has begun buying up patents. Last year,it purchased 1,500 patentsfromMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) relating to areas like wireless communication, multimedia and video, and the cloud.No Longer a Threat to Apple?At this point, Xiaomi is a paper tiger that isvalued at as little as $3.6 billion. In 2015, it sold 70 million-plus smartphones, missing its initial goal of 100 million and then the revised goal of 80 million. It's refusing to say how many it sold in 2016, but that silence speaks volumes.Hugo Barra bailed on the companya few weeks ago, joiningFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB). A few months before leaving, he toldReutersthat lower smartphone sales wouldn't impact the companybecause it made no money on them:""Basically we're giving [handsets] to you without making any money… we care about the recurring revenue streams over many years. We could sell 10 billion smartphones and we wouldn't make a single dime in profits.""The problem with that approach is that as of 2015,smartphones still accounted for 95% of the company's revenue. All those other products and services just don't seem to be sticking.Barra also told reporters not to expect Xiaomi to release a smartphone in the U.S. in 2017.3 Reasons Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Is Much More Than Its Main PlatformXiaomi CEO Lei Junposted a letter to employeeson Facebook in January. In it, he admitted the company had pushed ahead too fast, cutting into its long-term growth, but says the worst is over.The company's revenue target is RMB 100 billion (roughly $14.5 billion) -the same as its 2015 target. In trying to be so much, so fast, Xiaomi has set itself up for some very challenging times. If treading water is the goal it has set for itself, Apple doesn't have much to worry about.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace7 Tech Stocks With Explosive Growth PotentialThe Top 10 Dow Dividend Stocks for FebruaryThe postXiaomi Was Going to Rival Apple Inc.

Tech Companies Take a Stand Against Trump's Immigration Ban;2/6/2017;"Immigration has been a driving force behind many of the   leading technology companies in the United States.Some, includingMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) , are led by CEOs who were not born in this   country while over 200 companies on the Fortune 500 were started   by immigrants or their children. In addition most top tech brands   are global, with offices all over the world, and talent working   domestically that was not born in the U.S.At least partly because of that nearly 100 technology   companies including Microsoft,Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) ,Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) ,Facebook,Twitter, and many others have filed a legal brief in the U.S. Court of   Appeals for the 9th Circuit opposing President Donald Trump's   temporary immigration ban keeping people from seven predominantly   Muslim countries from entering the U.S. In the brief the   companies argue that the ban ""inflicts significant harm on   American business.""makeArticleAd();Trump signed an executive order banning immigration from     seven predominantly Muslim countries. Image source: Getty     Images.What are they opposing?In one of his first acts as president, Trump signed an   executive order banning refugees and visa-holders from seven   predominantly Muslim countries from entering the United States.   That order has been stayed by aU.S. District judgeand an appeals courtdeclined to immediately reinstatethe presidential order. The technology companies, many of which   operate and employ workers in and from the impacted countries   filed their brief to show their opposition to the president's   actions.""Immigrants make many of the Nation's greatest discoveries,   and create some of the country's most innovative and iconic   companies,"" the brief states. ""America has long recognized the   importance of protecting ourselves against those who would do us   harm. But it has done so while maintaining our fundamental   commitment to welcoming immigrants -- through increased   background checks and other controls on people seeking to enter   our country.""The companies that signed the brief acknowledged what Trump   was, at least on the surface, trying to accomplish with the   executive order.""We share your goal of ensuring that our immigration system   meets today's security needs and keeps our country safe,"" said a   draft of that letter obtained byBloomberg News. ""We are concerned, however, that your recent Executive Order   will affect many visa holders who work hard here in the United   States and contribute to our country's success.""Tech requires global talentPutting aside any political questions, the tech industry   opposes Trump's immigration ban in part because it takes global   talent to compete. The U.S. simply does not produce enough   workers -- specifically coders who write the software that powers   the products made by these companies -- to meet demand.To fill those needs companies across the U.S. use H1B visas to   receive special dispensation to hire workers who otherwise would   not be able to legally work in the country. A H1B visa, according   toMyVisaJobs.com, allows U.S. employers to temporarily employ foreign   professionals in specialty occupations for three years,   extendable to six years. ""To qualify for H1B Visa, the foreign   professional must hold a bachelor's or higher degree from an   accredited college or university in the specialty occupation,""   according to the site. In some cases specialized training can be   substituted for a degree.Technology companies dominate the list of employers using   workers on H1B visas. Data compiled by MyVisaJobs.com shows that   in 2016 Infosys held the top spot, having sponsored 25,405 visas.   while Microsoft, Apple, and Alphabet were all in the top 25.It's about more than self interestIt's easy to see the business reasons behind why these   technology companies oppose Trump's immigration restrictions.   Most, if not all of the companies that filed the brief would be   impacted by having employees unable to travel and in some cases   the executive order would impact hiring.For at least some of these companies, however, the opposition   goes beyond pure business logic. Many of these brands were either   founded by immigrants or by the children of immigrants and   immediate business concerns aside, they simply want a world where   new immigrants to the U.S. can be free to move here and found the   next Microsoft, Apple, or Alphabet.10 stocks we like better than MicrosoftWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Stock Market News for February 06, 2017;2/6/2017;"President Donald Trump's recent steps to reduce regulations related to the financial sector and an encouraging jobs report led benchmarks to end in the green on Friday. Optimism over Trump's financial de-regulation actions boosted bank stocks, which in turn led the Dow to register its best gains for the year. Moreover, a record number of jobs were created last month, which also had a positive impact on investor sentiment.For a look at the issues currently facing the markets, make sure to read today'sAhead of Wall Streetarticle.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) increased 0.9%, or 186.55 points, to close at 20,071.46. The S&P 500 rose 0.7% to close at 2,297.42. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 5,666.77, gaining 0.5%. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) declined 8.1% to settle at 10.97. A total of around 6.45 billion shares were traded Friday, lower than the last 20-session average of 6.71 billion. Advancers significantly outpaced declining stocks on the NYSE. For 76% stocks that advanced, 21% declined.Dow Register Best Gain in 2017The Dow registered its best gain so far this year on the back of Trump's latest move to scale back financial regulations as well as strong job gains. Also, the blue-chip index rallied past the psychological level of 20,000 once again. Further, the tech-based Nasdaq closed at a new record high.The President signed an executive order that directs the Secretary of the Treasury to assess the 2010 Dodd-Frank legislation. The order directs the Treasury Secretary to ""consult with the heads of the member agencies of the Financial Stability Oversight Council"" and ""report to the President within 120 days"" regarding any necessary legislative recommendations or regulatory changes.The order also outlines the core principles of his administration regarding regulation of the financial system. If passed by Congress, it could lead to the replacement of the Dodd Frank law with a new set of rules.Positive sentiment over Trump's latest steps on financial de-regulation led the Financial Select Sector SPDR (XLF) to rise 2%, which was the best performing sector among the S&P 500. Key component from this sector like Morgan Stanley (MS), Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS) and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) increased 5.5%, 4.6% and 3.1%, respectively.

This figure also exceeds December's reading of 157,000. Additionally, these are the best monthly job gains since September.However, expectations that the economy is moving towards a full employment scenario weighed on workers pay, with average hourly wages rising only 0.1% in January, lower than December's downwardly revised gain of 0.2%. Further, the unemployment rate, meantime, ticked up to 4.8% from 4.7% in January.In other economic news, the Institute for Supply Management reported that ISM Services Index fell to 56.5% in January.

Newly introduced immigration rules led to protests, criticism and legal challenges. Additionally, the tech sector expressed concerns over the impact these regulations would have on their businesses. Trump's approach on trade and foreign policy also led to widespread heartburn and dampened investor sentiment.Last Week's PerformanceThe index declined 0.6% on Monday as investors' grappled over President Trump's order to tighten immigration rules. An executive order by Trump banned immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries, including legal residents and visa holders. Such an executive order spawned legal challenges, congressional criticism and widespread protests. Trump had earlier fostered expectations that his administration will be business friendly and therefore good for stocks.The Dow logged its worst daily loss since mid-October on Monday, while a popular measure of Wall Street fear climbed to its highest level in about three months. Consumer spending increased 0.5% in December, matching the consensus estimate, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis.The index declined 0.5% on Tuesday amid signs that momentum following President Donald Trump's election victory in November was fading. His signing of an executive order to temporary restrict immigration saw weekend chaos and backlash, eventually affecting stocks. Industrial, technology and financials shares tanked outweighing gains among traditional safe sectors including health-care and utilities. Meantime, a gauge of consumer confidence retreated in January from its highest level in 15 years.Despite such setbacks, major indexes ended the month higher in what were their first January gains since 2013. The Dow added 0.5% for the month of January. Projections for stronger economic growth and upbeat corporate earnings boosted US stocks for the first January rise in five years. Stocks rallied on hopes that the new administration's policies including lowering of taxes and cutting regulations will bolster economic growth.The materials sector has fueled the rally, advancing 5.1% so far this year, following a 14% gain in 2016. Technology shares that trailed behind the broader market last year have also recorded sharp gains this year. The sector has risen 3.6% in January, its best month since last July. Earnings in the final quarter of 2016 came on the heels of growth in the third quarter that snapped a 15-month decline in earnings.The index gained 0.1% on Wednesday after Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL-Free Report), the largest U.S. company by market cap, reported upbeat earnings. Meanwhile, the Fed ended its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday and revealed that measures of consumer and business sentiment have improved of late. But the Fed kept rates unchanged within a range of 0.5% to 0.75%.More importantly for investors, the central bank didn't give any sign that it would raise rates in its next meeting in March, putting the probability of such a move at only 18%, according to CME Group. The ISM manufacturing index climbed to 56% last month from 54.5% in December, marking the fifth straight gain and also its highest level since end 2014.The index declined a meager 0.03% on Thursday after President Donald Trump's approach on trade and foreign policy dented investor sentiment.

Monday’s Vital Data: Bank of America Corp (BAC), Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Visa Inc (V);2/6/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsU.S. stock futures are mixed this morning, as last week's earnings and jobs euphoria has failed to carry over into premarket action this morning. Furthermore, Wall Street is wary ahead of key economic data from the White House, as President Trump is s required to submit a preliminary budget proposal to Congress on the first Monday of February. Investors are waiting to see just how Trump's campaign promises for massive infrastructure spending and tax cuts will take shape.makeArticleAd();Against this backdrop, futures on theDow Jones Industrial Averageare down 0.21%, whileS&P 500futures are off 0.23% and theNasdaq-100futures are down 0.22%.On the options front, 3 Feb. options expiration drove heavy volume on Friday, as a wealth of earnings speculation finally came to a head. On the day, some 18.6 million calls and 14.7 million puts changed hands. Over on the CBOE, the single-session equity put/call volume ratio ticked higher to 0.68 while the 10-day moving average held at a three-month high of 0.69.Turning to Friday's volume leaders,Bank of America Corp(NYSE:BAC) attracted a surge in call activity ahead of President Donald Trump's executive order aimed at rolling back financial regulations - setting the stage for the repeal of the Dodd-Frank Act. Elsewhere,Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) calls were also wildly popular after new broke that the company would begin assembling iPhones in India by the end of April. Finally,Visa Inc(NYSE:V) jumped more than 4.5% after posting better-than-expected quarterly earnings.Bank of America Corp (BAC)Months of speculation came to an end on Friday, whenPresident Trump took steps to roll back regulationson the financial industry - setting the stage for banks like Bank of America to begin unrestricted share buybacks and dividend increases. What's more, financial industry analysts believe that if regulation rollbacks are on the table for banks, then corporate tax cuts can't be far behind, as they were also among Trump's campaign promises.9 Best Cheap Stocks to Buy Now Under $9.99BAC stock has been itching for such news for weeks now, with investors banking on deregulation and the possibility of increased dividends given BofA's strong performance in 2016. As a result, BAC options traders flooded the stock with calls on Friday, with these typically bullish bets making up 77% of the 1.3 million contracts traded.Taking a broader look at short-term BAC speculation, the February/March put/call open interest ratio has plunged in recent weeks to a perch at 0.50, with calls doubling puts among contracts set to expire within the next two months. Currently, the most popular strike is the March $25 call, where more than 174,000 contracts reside. This strike rests about 7.3% out of the money and last traded at an ask price of 20 cents, or $20 per contract.Apple Inc.

Apple will startmaking iPhones in India by the end of April, with Taiwan'sWistron Corp.assembling the phones in Bangalore, said Priyank Kharge, the state's information technology minister.

Overall, some 1.03 million contracts traded on Apple, with calls gobbling up 71% of the day's take.That said, there is still plenty of room for additional call activity on AAPL, with the stock's February/March put/call OI ratio arriving at 0.85, with the March $125 arriving as the most popular calls strike with more than 81,000 calls in residence. This reading has begun to drift lower during the past week, and Friday's India news should help spur additional call activity this week.Visa Inc (V)Visa is ""everywhere investors should want to be,""Cowen and Company told investorsafter the former's strong quarterly earnings report. After the close on Thursday, Visa posted first-quarter earnings of 86 cents a share on revenue of $4.5 billion, easily topping estimates for 78 cents per share on sales of $4.3 billion.

Calls have begun to add up for V stock, with the February/March put/call OI ratio falling to a reading of 0.66 on Friday.That said, there is some trepidation in the March series, where peak call OI of 13,000 contracts rests at the in-the-money $80 strike.

5 Must-Read Quotes From Skyworks Solutions' Latest Investor Call;2/6/2017;"Analog semiconductor manufacturerSkyworks Solutions(NASDAQ: SWKS) recently reportedstrong fiscal first-quarter resultsthat came in ahead of management's guidance. Traders cheered the   report, sending shares up by double digits.While Skyworks' press release had a lot of good information to   share, the company's conference call is also a great source of   additional insights. Below are five must-read quotes from the   call.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();On diversifying the businessOne of the biggest knocks against Skyworks is that the company   is overly reliant onApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) . That argument holds water today, as the Mac   maker still accounts for more than 40% of Skyworks' total   revenue.However, management affirmed on the call that the company is   growing quite well with all of its customers, not just Apple.   Here's what CEO Liam Griffin had to say about the company's   growth excluding its ""largest customer"":Our growth and success outside of our largest customer has     been outstanding. Huawei became the No. 2 account for us this     last quarter. They're going to continue to be one of our     leaders. We have our customer in Korea who will continue to     grow significantly into 2017. And our largest customers will     set up very well for us as well, as we address some very     complex architectures with compelling products. So we feel     really good about that on the mobile side.And then let me remind you that the broad market portfolio,     from infrastructure to IoT [Internet of Things] to early stages     of automotive, all look good, and the staff there are     double-digit year over year.CEO Griffin also rattled off several examples of new-design   wins or expanding relationships with these other customers.   Specifically, he called out relationships with companies such asComcast,Netgear,Ubiquiti Networks, Xiaomi, ""multiple tier 1 OEMs,"" among others.On returning to year-over-year growthApple's decision in 2016 to reduce its channel inventory   levels had a big impact on Skyworks. In fact, Skyworks revenuedeclinedyear over year in each of the last three quarterly reports, which   isn't something that growth investors like to see.Thankfully, CFO Kris Sennesael says that the days of declining   sales growth are over:I think we've weathered a bit of a storm here in 2016 and     most of the clouds there have abated. And it's not just market     shifts. We're gaining share, we're creating new content, we're     expanding in IoT and in broad markets, and it's meaningful, and     it's sustainable. We're confident that the second half for us     ... should be a double-digit growth rate year-over-year.For the upcoming quarter, management is guiding for revenue   growth of 8% and earnings-per-share growth of 12%. That's got to   make bulls smile from ear to ear.On the next phase of growthIt is possible that smartphone sales are nearing a plateau, so   Skyworks likes to remind investors that a few technologies will   be hitting the mass market soon that could drive the company's   next phase of growth. Specifically, management remains   uber-bullish on the opportunities that will be opened up once 5G   network technology and autonomous driving become a part of   everyday life.Here's CEO Griffin talking about the potential of 5G network   technology:[M]arket projections suggest 5G data rates will approach 10x     the speed of current 4G and LTE systems. To put this in     perspective, downloading a full-length HD movie in 3G took 1     day. In 4G the same file took minutes. On a 5G network, this     content will be downloaded in mere seconds.And Griffin commenting on the extreme data needs of autonomous   vehicles:Looking out over the next few years, the amount of data that     will be delivered to and from the car is estimated to be 5 to     10 times more than the bandwidth used by today's smartphone.     For instance, by 2020, a single autonomous car is expected to     consume 4,000 gigabits of data per day in real-time     diagnostics, positioning, vehicle-to-vehicle communications.     And that's equivalent to the daily data consumed by more than     2,000 smartphone users in 2017.On taking care of shareholdersSkyworks has been returning its excess capital to shareholders   for years in the form of buybacks and dividend payments. Here's   CFO Sennesael commenting on the company's recent actions to   continue to reward shareholders:We are definitely committed to continuing to return cash to     the shareholder with our dividend program and our share buyback     program. We returned $106 million in Q1, repurchasing 1.4     million shares in Q1.And so we have now put in place a new $500 million program.     Historically, we have been returning 40%, 50% of our free cash     flow to the shareholders, and so that's something that we will     continue to do so.All in all, Skyworks delivered an excellent quarter, and   provided shareholders with plenty of reasons to remain   optimistic.10 stocks we like better than Skyworks     SolutionsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Prime Air Drones Surprise in Super Bowl Ad;2/6/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIf you were one of the estimated 100 million+ viewers of Super Bowl 51, you saw some drones. There were the 200 quadcopters fromIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) that were part of Lady Gaga's halftime show. Those we were expecting, but another drone that showed up was a surprise.Amazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) chose the Super Bowl to tease Amazon Prime Air - packages delivered to your home by AMZN drones.makeArticleAd();Source: AmazonA big part of the Super Bowl experience is the advertising. This is the one time of year when viewers actuallywantto see commercials. And with those viewersestimated at over 100 million, companies that forked out over $5 million for a 30-second spot make a big splash.Heck, even in Canada, the networks wereforced to run American adsinstead of substituting local commercials.And those 100 million-plus viewers saw a very short teaser commercial with anAmazon drone hoveringoutside the window of a woman who had just ordered some snacks: Amazon Prime Air.10 Stocks to Buy That Already Make America GreatAccording to the voice of Alexa, AMZN's personal digital assistant, we can ""Look for delivery soon.""History of Amazon Prime AirHow can you talk about the history of a service that doesn't yet exist? In the case of Amazon Prime Air and its use of Amazon drones, there's already a big backstory to talk about. AMZNhas a websitewhere it describes the services, shows off a number of Amazon drone videos and even has an FAQ section that spikes out many of the details about Amazon Prime Air.""We're excited about Prime Air - a delivery system from Amazon designed to safely get packages to customers in 30 minutes or less using unmanned aerial vehicles, also called drones. Prime Air has great potential to enhance the services we already provide to millions of customers by providing rapid parcel delivery that will also increase the overall safety and efficiency of the transportation system.""The Amazon Prime Air storykicked off in 2013, when AMZN CEO Jeff Bezos took the wraps off a top secret project with Amazon drones on60 Minutes. Delivery of items under five pounds that would fit in the quadcopter's bucket would take place in under 30 minutes. At the time, Bezos told viewers to expect Amazon Prime Air within four to five years.Last December, a milestone was reached when AMZN claimedthe first Amazon drone delivery- an Amazon Fire TV and a bag of popcorn. As part of an Amazon Prime Air trial in the U.K., the company's drones had begun autonomously delivering packages to a very small group of consumers.Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Has a New Hero: Services!At the end of the year, the company hit the news again when it was discovered it hadfiled a patent for a flying warehousethat would serve as an airborne base for Amazon drone deliveries.When Can You Expect an Amazon Drone atYourWindow?Despite the Super Bowl ad and Alexa's promise that Amazon Prime Air is coming soon, it's a little early to get excited yet. In particular, there are regulatory hurdles to overcome. FAA restrictions on drones that aren't flying in line-of-site operation were the primary reason why the Amazon drone trial is taking place in the U.K. instead of here. AMZN even put up a small disclaimer on its ad:""Prime Air is not available in some states (or any really). Yet.""But the fact that it spent the big Super Bowl ad bucks and showed off that Amazon drone to millions of viewers shows AMZN is serious about this. Amazon Prime Air may not be launching tomorrow, but the company is determined to get people excited about drone delivery. The campaign to turn Amazon drone delivery into the next big thing has officially begun.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceIs Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Ending the Age of Intel (INTC)?Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Steps on Amazon and Google's TurfThe postAmazon.com, Inc.

Mega Cap ETF (XLG) Hits New 52-Week High;2/6/2017;"For investors seeking momentum,Guggenheim S&P 500 Top 50 ETXLGis probably on radar now. The fund just hit a 52-week high, and is up roughly 23.3% from its 52-week low price of $130.63/share.makeArticleAd();But are more gains in store for this ETF? Let's take a quick look at the fund and the near-term outlook on it to get a better idea on where it might be headed:XLG in FocusThis fund offers exposure to mega cap securities with key holdings in information technology. As such, it has significant concentration on the top two firms - AppleAAPLand MicrosoftMSFT- with a combined 12.4% share while other firms hold less than 3.7% of assets. The product charges investors 20 basis points in fees (see:all the Large Cap ETFs here).Why the Move?The mega cap space of the broad U.S. stock market has been an area to watch lately given that the major bourses are again hovering around record levels. Trump's policy for the financial sector acted as a major catalyst for the stock market after a slew of anti-trade policies. Further, encouraging earnings reports and upbeat job data also supported the rally. In particular, the Q4 earnings season is faring better than recent years, with earnings growth not only on track to reach the highest level in two years but total earnings set to hit a new quarterly record.More Gains Ahead?Currently, XLG has a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 or 'Hold' rating with a High risk outlook. Therefore, it is hard to get a handle on its future returns in one way or the other.

No, Google's Brand Is Not More Valuable Than Apple's;2/5/2017;"Last week, Brand Finance came out with itsannual listing of brand valuations. In a somewhat shocking finding, the consulting group declared   thatApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) had lost its supremacy toAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) subsidiary Google.Alphabet is a phenomenal company with a long track record of   innovation, and the Google brand is extremely powerful.   Nevertheless, it still isn't in the same league as Apple's brand   in terms of total value.Is Apple turning sour?While Brand Finance still rates Apple as the second most   valuable brand in the world, it appears to have a fairly negative   view of the iPhone maker. According to the recent report:makeArticleAd();However, Apple's evangelists are beginning to lose their     faith. The snaking queues of early adopters have shrunk almost     to the point of invisibility. Apple has failed to maintain its     technological advantage and has repeatedly disillusioned its     advocates with tweaks when material changes were expected.Put simply, Apple has over-exploited the goodwill of its     customers, it has failed to generate significant revenues from     newer products such as the Apple Watch and cannot demonstrate     that genuinely innovative technologies desired by consumers are     in the pipeline. Its brand has lost its luster and must now     compete on an increasingly level playing field not just with     traditional rivalSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) , but a slew of Chinese brands such as     Huawei and OnePlus in the smartphone market, Apple's key source     of profitability.As a result of this assessment, Brand Finance reduced its   estimate of the Apple brand's value by 27% year over year, to   $107.1 billion. Meanwhile, it estimated Google's brand value at   $109.5 billion, up 24% from $88.2 billion a year ago. Brand   Finance cited Google's dominance in search, among other things,   to justify the big increase in its brand value.Consumers are paying more and more for iPhonesBrand Finance's declining opinion of the Apple brand is   contradicted by consumers' willingness to pay more and more for   iPhones. Last quarter, Apple reported record quarterly iPhone   sales of 78.3 million units. Even more impressively, the average   selling price (ASP) reached a new record of $695.The iPhone's ASP hit a new record last quarter. Image     source: Apple.In the same quarter two years ago, right after Apple released   the hugely popular iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, the iPhone's ASP   had surged 8% year over year, to $687. Apple's ability to   continue growing that ASP over the past two years, despite facing   stiff foreign exchange headwinds in both years, is a testament to   the massive value of its brand.Indeed, the cost of high-quality smartphones is coming down.   Leaving aside Samsung, several Chinese manufacturers have become   known for designing high-quality smartphones and selling them at   near-breakeven prices in recent years. Apple's ability to command   a huge price premium over competitors -- which extends beyond   smartphones to PCs and (to a lesser extent) tablets -- indicates   that its brand is as strong as ever.Apple is a profit machineAccording to Brand Finance, Apple has failed to maintain a   technological lead over Samsung and other rivals. In fact, many   tech pundits have argued in recent years that Samsung has   overtaken Apple in terms of innovation.Assuming that the two companies are on a relatively even   technological footing, they should be able to produce roughly   similar earnings. However, that's not even close to being   true.Last quarter, Apple barely retook the lead in terms of   smartphone shipments with 78.3 million, compared to 77.5 million   shipments for Samsung,according to Strategy Analytics. Yet Samsung's mobile-division operating profit totaled just   $2.1 billion for the quarter. By contrast, Apple's operating   profit was more than 10 times higher at $23.4 billion.On a full-year basis -- or looking just at the smartphone   business -- Apple's advantage is somewhat smaller. But any way   you slice it, Apple generates many times more profit than   Samsung. (In its most recent fiscal year, Apple's operating   profit was $60 billion, compared to about $10 billion for   Samsung's mobile division.)If Apple doesn't have superior technology relative to Samsung,   its brand must be doing most of the heavy lifting to generate $50   billion of additional operating profit on an annual basis. That's   more than double Alphabet'stotalannual operating profit of $23.7 billion.Google may be a powerful brand. However, it doesn't come close   to the value of the Apple brand, which has turned the   traditionally low-margin technology hardware business into a   long-term cash cow that churns out tens of billions of dollars of   profit every year.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Apple Inc. Has Big Plans for Its Fast-Growing Services Business;2/4/2017;"Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is primarily a hardware company. Most of its   revenue comes from the sale of iPhone, iPad, and Mac products.   Beyond those key product categories, the company generates   meaningful revenue from its Apple Watch family of smartwatch   products, as well as from the various accessories, such as its   well-received AirPod line of wireless earbuds.Apple music running on different Apple products. Image     source: Apple.makeArticleAd();However, one of the most exciting parts of the company's   portfolio is the services business, which the company says   ""includes revenue from Digital Content and Services, AppleCare,   Apple Pay, licensing and other services.""This segment has been on a robust growth path for quite some   time, with revenue here growing 10% in the company's fiscal year   2015 and then a whopping 22% in fiscal year 2016. In the   company's most recent quarter, it reported that services revenue   was up another 18% year-over-year.This isn't a small business, either -- at least in absolute   terms. It generated more than $24 billion in the company's last   fiscal year, making up more than 10% of the company's   consolidated revenue. To really put it into proper perspective,   services was Apple's second-largest business by revenue in 2016   -- bigger than the iPad and Mac.On the company's most recent earnings call, CEO Tim Cook made   public the company's vision for services over the next four   years, and it's quite ambitious.Doubling revenue in just four years""Services are becoming a larger part of our business, and we   expect the revenues to be the size of a Fortune 100 company this   year"", Cook said.Cook then went on to say that Apple ""feel[s] great about this   momentum"" and that the company aims to ""double the size of [its]   Services business in the next four years"".Of course, what Apple's goals are and what happens aren't   necessarily the same thing, but the fact that management is   willing to put a growth figure out there -- a hard number that   investors will now hold Apple accountable for -- speaks to the   company's confidence.What would a doubling of this business mean?Put simply, doubling the business from the revenue levels seen   in 2016 would mean that, by 2020, Apple's services business will   be bringing in about $48 billion. If Apple can get the business   to that scale and then grow it at a modest rate from that point   forward (perhaps 5% to 10% annually), then that would do wonders   for Apple's longer-term revenue growth prospects.What's not entirely clear, however, is how that growth will   translate into incremental profitability. CFO Luca Maestri said   on the call that, on average, the gross profit margin of Services   businesses ishigherthan the corporate average, so an increase in Services mix should   help Apple on the gross profit margin front.That said, as Apple scales up its services revenue, it will   likely need to drive up operating expenses associated with the   business, as well. While I do expect nice growth in profitability   from a boost in services, the incremental gross profit isn't all   flowing to the bottom line.At the end of the day, if Apple hits its growth target with   respect to this growing segment, it should be less dependent on   the iPhone and could ultimately see earnings multiple expansion   as software/services companies tend to be valued more by   investors than pure hardware plays.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Will Donald Trump Target Share Buybacks Next?;2/4/2017;"Donald Trump. Image source: Whitehouse.gov.President Donald Trump has taken several bold steps since   taking office, but one area seems to be a bigger priority than   any other. Trump has been adamant about getting American   companies to invest in the U.S. by building factories and plants   and hiring American workers. In his inaugural address, he   declared that as a central theme of his presidency, imploring   American companies to ""buy American and hire American.""makeArticleAd();Before he even took the oath of office, Trump said he had   struck a deal withUnited Technologies'Carrier Industries to keep about 800 jobs in Indiana that were   slated to go to Mexico. He pressured other manufacturers like   automakers to keep jobs in the country, and may have influencedFord'sdecision to scrap plans for a new plant in Mexico.Once in office, Trump backed out of the Trans Pacific   Partnership, a 12-nation trade deal, and met with leaders of the   Big 3 automakers to urge them to expand in the U.S.While those moves may help curry the favor of Trump's base,   their effect on investment in the U.S. is uncertain. The   automakers already believe that the auto market is at its   cyclical peak, as last year marked a record for vehicle sales,   and they are therefore reluctant to invest in new factories.Manufacturing jobs have certainly declined over the past   generation, but analysts tend to blame that on automation rather   than outsourcing.Trump has supported tax breaks that would encourage companies   to bring back money kept overseas. Some see this as step one to   getting the companies to invest in American jobs. Others see it   as priming the companies to use the money to buy back their own   shares. Larry Fink, BlackRock founder and CEO and a member of   Trump's ""President's Strategic and Policy Forum,"" recently warned   that companies should only engage in buybacks ""when they are   confident that the return on those buybacks will ultimately   exceed the cost of capital and the long-term returns of investing   in future growth.""Fink mentioned Trump by name twice in his Jan. 24annual letter to CEOs, saying in part:If tax reform also includes some form of reduced taxation     for repatriation of cash trapped overseas, BlackRock will be     looking to companies' strategic frameworks for an explanation     of whether they will bring cash back to the U.S., and if so,     how they plan to use it. Will it be used simply for more share     buybacks? Or is it a part of a capital plan that appropriately     balances returning capital to shareholders with prudently     investing for future growth?President Trump has indicated an interest in infrastructure     investment, which has the dual benefits of improving overall     productivity and creating jobs, especially for workers     displaced by technology.Fink went on to write that infrastructure investing is not a   solution to automation taking jobs, saying ""businesses will need   to increase the earnings potential of the workers who drive   returns, helping the employee who once operated a machine learn   to program it.""Trump has showed himself committed to American jobs. We don't   know if he will use his bully pulpit to try to force companies to   forgo buybacks, but he might if he follows the logic that doing   so would result in the companies instead putting the money to use   in ways that would boost American workers. Let's take a look at   the issue.A Wall Street favoriteShare repurchases, orbuybacks, in which a company buys share of its own stock, were once   illegal, as they were seen as facilitating insider trading   because a company could act on information not available to the   public. The SEC changed the rule in 1982, and since then, stock   buybacks have become increasingly popular. According toHSBC, American companies have spent $2.1 trillion on repurchases over   the last five years.Often called a form of financial engineering by detractors,   share buybacks boost a company's earnings per share, not by   increasing earnings, but by reducing the number of shares   outstanding. The pie is split among fewer shares. Investors to   tend to cheer share buybacks due to the lift they give to stock   prices, but from a larger economic perspective, and possibly from   Donald Trump's point of view, they may be the least efficient   form of spending cash.Image source: Getty Images.By allocating money to buy back shares, business are choosing   to spend profits on inflating earnings per share instead of   potentially investing in the long-term growth of the business by   opening new plants, hiring or training new workers, investing in   research and development, or even acquiring other companies.   Unlike dividends, the other from of returning capital to   shareholders, buybacks don't give money to current shareholders   that can be reinvested, and they do not add market value to the   company, which is based in part on the number of shares   outstanding. In other words, no value is being created by   repurchases in the aggregate.  Share repurchases are   controversial for a number of reasons, but their ability to   dissuade companies from investing in long-term growth is   certainly one of the biggest.How the pros do itWith interest rates especially low in recent years, many   companies have taken on debt, not to expand their businesses, but   to reward shareholders with buybacks.Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) founder Steve Jobs refused to pay a dividend,   believing that it meant the company was out of ideas. He also   didn't authorize share repurchases.Apple under Tim Cook, however, has taken out $87 billion in   debt to fund repurchases, reducing the share count by 1.3 billion   in the process, and spending about $125 billion in the process.   Part of the reason Apple has done so is because much of its cash   is parked overseas and it wants to avoid repatriation taxes, but   one could see the Trump administration cutting a deal with the   iPhone maker to reduce or eliminate repatriation taxes if it   agreed to invest in jobs in the U.S.Apple, with nearly $200 billion overseas, has been demanding   such an arrangement for years, and could be willing to invest   some of that cash in the U.S. if the tax rate was significantly   reduced. Notably FoxConn, its biggest supplier, said it was   considering opening a plant in Pennsylvania that would employ   50,000 Americans. Apple is unlikely itself to invest in domestic   manufacturing, but since FoxConn assembles iPhones and other   Apple products, if it opened a plant in Pennsylvania, it would   mean that some Apple products would be made in America, though   outsourced to a Chinese company.Trump has said he would like to make deals with corporations   to bring some of their overseas cash back home, though that would   likely come with stipulations.Goldman Sachspredicted Trump's tax and repatriation plans would encourage more   buybacks as it frees up cash for companies, but BlackRock's Fink   scolded corporations in his recent letter for spending so much on   buybacks.He noted that the total thatS&P 500companies have spent on dividends and buybacks in the last   12 months is greater than the operating profits they've   earned. With $5 trillion in assets under management, the   Blackrock CEO's missives attract attention on Wall Street, and if   he gets the President's ear, Trump could end up using the bully   pulpit to excoriate big business for its excessive buybacks.IBM's(NYSE: IBM) recent misadventures perhaps best illustrate the   folly of buybacks. After outlining a goal in 2010 of reaching $20   in earnings per share (EPS) by 2015, Big Blue spent aggressively   on repurchases to pump up EPS to meet that target, pouring $70   billion between 2010-2014 into lowering its share count. As a   result, however, the business suffered.Revenue at the tech giant has now fallen for 19 quarters in a   row, and the company was forced to step back from its $20 EPS   goal in 2014. In 2016, adjusted EPS was just $13.59, down 9% from   the previous year. In the meantime, IBM has also slashed   headcount as the number of employees has fallen by close to   100,000, since its peak in 2014, to 368,000. Considering Big   Blue's decision to use profits to reward investors while laying   off employees, the company would seem to be a target ripe for   Trump's ire.It's not just tech companies that are using this tactic, as   manufacturers likeGM, Ford, andCaterpillarhave all been spending on share repurchases recently.Any attempt by the Trump administration to tackle share   repurchases would likely rankle Wall Street, which favors the   practice. But as the president looks for more levers to pull to   boost the ""forgotten men and women"" of America, share buybacks   may start to look like a worthy target.10 stocks we like better than Wal-MartWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock     tip, it can pay to listen.

Why This 1 Number Is So Important to Apple Investors;2/3/2017;"Image source: Apple.The iPhone is by far the most important product inApple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) lineup. The device accounted for over 69% of the   company's first-quarter sales. After three consecutive quarters   of unit sales declines, Apple righted the ship with the release   of the iPhone 7 last fall, driving a near-5% increase in unit   sales.makeArticleAd();But more important than the growth in units is Apple's ability   to sell its higher-end device, the iPhone 7 Plus. CEO Tim Cook   revealed the newest model was the best selling Plus model it's   released yet during the company's first-quarter earnings call.   The ability to sell higher-end devices is key for the company   going forward as it becomes increasingly difficult to grow unit   sales.A look at selling pricesData source: Apple quarterly reports.The first thing that stands out in the chart above is the huge   drop in average sales price (ASP) during the previous three   quarters. The drop coincides with the release of the lower-priced   iPhone SE, which starts at just $399. After a late second-quarter   release, sales of the model seemed to peak in the third quarter,   resulting in a low $595 ASP for all iPhone units.Apple also faced significant foreign exchange headwinds over   the past year. CFO Luca Maestri noted the dollar has strengthened   25% against the basket of currencies where Apple does business   since June 2014. That led Apple to raise some of its prices in   foreign countries last year.But more iPhone shoppers opted for the high-end iPhone 7 Plus   last quarter, leading to a record ASP of $695. That's even more   astonishing considering the inclusion of the iPhone SE in those   sales.What's so telling about the popularity of the iPhone 7   Plus?Unlike in the two previous Plus models of the iPhone, the 7   Plus included a higher-end camera compared to its   smaller-screened sister. That point of differentiation may be   what led more consumers to opt for the more expensive device last   quarter.The significant demand for the 7 Plus shows that Apple has the   potential to drive sales growth by further differentiating the   Plus lineup from the standard iPhone model. Instead of just   offering a larger screen, Apple can keep its best innovations   exclusively for its highest-paying customers before letting them   trickle down to the lower-priced models.Such a move would strengthen the position of the Plus model in   the simple good, better, best price positioning Apple uses. Just   as importantly, the upsell is easy thanks to installment plans --   just $4 more per month gets you the best ever phone, camera,   mobile gaming machine, Snapchat device, and so on.But don't get excited just yetThere's no doubt that Apple benefited from one of its biggest   competitors running into some technical difficulties late last   year.Samsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) had to recall its Galaxy Note 7 after units   started randomly exploding due to battery malfunctions.Many Note 7 customers likely ended up buying an iPhone 7 Plus   for its similarly sized screen. Cook noted it saw the highest   Android switcher rate of any quarter.Obviously, Apple can't rely on Samsung or one of its other   major competitors having problems with their large-screen phones   every quarter. That's why investors must pay attention to the   iPhone ASP going forward to see if last quarter was a fluke or if   Apple's differentiation strategy is paying off. If ASP continues   to rise, it could bode well if Apple further differentiates its   newest Plus model even more from the standard model in the   fall.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Why 2 Well-Known Tech Companies Are Making Significant AI Acquisitions;2/3/2017;"With the race for artificial intelligence (AI) shifting into   high gear, companies are not only developing AI systems in-house,   but are increasingly bringing start-ups into the fold to augment   their efforts. Market intelligence firm CB Insights released its   list ofAI acquisitionsover the last five years. A review of the most active acquirers   can provide insight into future developments at those companies,   and show how the new technologies are being integrated.Artificial intelligence acquisitions are skyrocketing. Image     source: Pixabay.makeArticleAd();One intriguing revelation is that many of the acquired   companies work in the areas of deep learning and machine   learning, two disciplines within AI. Algorithms and software are   used to develop models of the human brain called neural networks,   attempting to recreate our capacity to learn. Another revelation   is that much of the acquired technology can be directly   integrated intovirtual personal assistants. This is an area of great interest to big tech, but is alsobeing pursuedby a surprising number ofother companies.Apple is on an AI buying spree. Image source: Author.Apple is giving Siri a makeoverApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) has been at the leading edge of AI since its   introduction of Siri five years ago. While it is making a   significant number of acquisitions, each appears to specialize in   a different area:VocalIQ concentrated its deep-learning capabilities to     better understand human speech. This could provide Siri with an     upgrade.Perceptio can run neural-network algorithms and perform     advanced calculations locally on a cellphone, without uploading     user data to the cloud. This would help Apple protect consumer     data bykeeping it localto each phone.Emotient attempts to read facial expressions in order to     determine a person's emotional state. This recent acquisition     is likely related to apatent Apple applied forin 2014, describing a system for determining mood based on     numerous factors, including facial expressions.Tuplejump provided a better way to apply deep learning to     large data sets as they are uploaded. Apple has previously     stated that it could receive filtered data from iPhones, and     this technology would enable it to process the data in real     time.One especially compelling acquisition was Turi, described as a   ""machine learning platform for developers and data scientists.""   It had created tools that allowed developers to build apps   utilizing deep learning that could scale for many users; this   tool kit was described as being similar to Google's TensorFlow   open-source machine-learning library. Turi allows Apple to bring   AI capabilities to developers for its App Store offerings.Twitter wants a seat at the big tech tableTwitter acquired Whetlab to boost AI efforts. Image source:     Whetlab.Twitter(NYSE:TWTR) has made a number of AI-related acquisitions in the area of   machine learning. Each appears to provide the company with   specific opportunities to improve its current business:Madbits focused on technology related to searching and     understanding images, and the ability to organize large data     sets. It previously released an iOS app that created photo     collages.Magic Pony developed neural networks that can sharpen     blurry cellphone images or video to near HD-quality. It also     can use information in the original to improvise new or     expanded images -- great for use in virtual reality. These will     both help Twitter increase its image features.TellApart allows marketers to better target potential     customers across device platforms. This could improve     monetization of Twitter's ads.Whetlab is probably the most interesting acquisition. While it   is less business-specific, it will bring the most advanced AI   capability. It created technology that helps companies jump-start   their deep learning by providing an infrastructure; the time   required to train AI systems is reduced from months to days. This   technology can be used to improve a variety of areas in Twitter's   business, including language understanding, image recognition,   and user profiles.These acquisitions reveal how two very different technology   companies are integrating AI with a goal of improving their   respective businesses. Acquisitions for their own sake are folly,   but using them to gain a competitive advantage, improve business   processes, or to better serve customers can lead to success. Time   will tell how successful each of these companies has been in   leveraging these technologies.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

"Apple (AAPL) On Track to ""Make in India"" by April 2017?";2/3/2017;"Reportedly,AppleAAPLwill set up its iPhone assembly line in India by the end of Apr 2017. The iPhone-maker will set up its first manufacturing unit in Bangalore, Karnataka and has teamed up with Wistron Corp. from Taiwan to take care of the assembly of the iPhones.Why India?The decision comes at a time when the smartphone market is witnessing a slowdown in other parts of the world except India, which remains the fastest growing market in the segment.With Narendra Modi at the helm, the tagline of ""Make in India"" is fast catching up with global manufacturing majors. The Apple deal could open the doors for other global players to set up their manufacturing units in the country.However, China still remains a major contender in the manufacturing space.Apple Inc. Price and ConsensusApple Inc. Price and Consensus|Apple Inc. QuoteWhat Does This Mean for Apple?Currently, the smartphone scene in India is being dominated by Samsung Electronics Co. and other comparatively cheap Chinese brands such as Oppo.As per a Counterpoint Research report, in 2016, Apple shipped 2.5 million iPhones to India. However, the company ranked 10thin the top smartphone vendors list for the December quarter. An estimated 750 million smartphones are projected to be sold in the country by 2020, where Apple currently has only a 2% market share.As per capita income in the country is on the rise, this trend is likely to witness a major shift with people turning to premium-priced phones such as the iPhone in the future.Moreover, Apple's strategy to remain a fabless firm by handing over capital intensive processes such as manufacturing, factory building and staff hiring to third parties (in this case Wistron Corp.) are expected to positively impact the company's bottom-line going ahead.Stock Performance OverviewShares of Apple have performed more or less in line with the broader ZacksComputer - Mini Computersindustry over the last one year.

"Dow 30 Stock Roundup: Apple, Intel, Exxon Beat; Merck, Pfizer, Chevron Miss on Revenues";2/3/2017;"The Dow suffered losses over the week as optimism over Trump's election gave way to apprehension over his actions as President. Newly introduced immigration rules led to protests, criticism and legal challenges. Additionally, the tech sector expressed concerns over the impact these regulations would have on their businesses. Trump's approach on trade and foreign policy also led to widespread heartburn and dampened investor sentiment.Last Week's PerformanceThe Dow lost a meager 0.04% last Friday after fourth quarter GDP fell short of estimates.  U.S economy slowed more than expected in the fourth quarter after plunge in shipments of soyabeans adversely affected exports.

Industrial, technology and financials shares tanked outweighing gains among traditional safe sectors including health-care and utilities. Meantime, a gauge of consumer confidence retreated in January from its highest level in 15 years.Despite such setbacks, major indexes ended the month higher in what were their first January gains since 2013. The Dow added 0.5% for the month of January. Projections for stronger economic growth and upbeat corporate earnings boosted US stocks for the first January rise in five years. Stocks rallied on hopes that the new administration's policies including lowering of taxes and cutting regulations will bolster economic growth.The materials sector has fueled the rally, advancing 5.1% so far this year, following a 14% gain in 2016. Technology shares that trailed behind the broader market last year have also recorded sharp gains this year. The sector has risen 3.6% in January, its best month since last July. Earnings in the final quarter of 2016 came on the heels of growth in the third quarter that snapped a 15-month decline in earnings.The index gained 0.1% on Wednesday after Apple Inc.AAPL, the largest U.S. company by market cap, reported upbeat earnings. Meanwhile, the Fed ended its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday and revealed that measures of consumer and business sentiment have improved of late. But the Fed kept rates unchanged within a range of 0.5% to 0.75%.More importantly for investors, the central bank didn't give any sign that it would raise rates in its next meeting in March, putting the probability of such a move at only 18%, according to CME Group. The ISM manufacturing index climbed to 56% last month from 54.5% in December, marking the fifth straight gain and also its highest level since end 2014.The index declined a meagre 0.03% on Thursday after President Donald Trump's approach on trade and foreign policy dented investor sentiment. Investors grappled over Trump's executive order to tighten immigration rules, while the White House warned Iran that the country could face new sanctions over a recent ballistic missile test. Trump also labelled a refugee swap agreement with staunch ally Australia as a ""dumb deal"" and reiterated concerns about trade ties with Mexico.ComponentsMovingthe IndexApple's first quarter of fiscal 2017 earnings of $3.36 per share and revenues of $78.4 billion easily topped the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.22 and $76.9 billion.

3 Interesting Things We Learned From Snapchat's IPO Prospectus;2/3/2017;"Snap Inc., the parent company of photo-sharing application Snapchat, recently filed a prospectus with the SEC and is officially gearing up for an initial public offering. Snapchat has taken the social media landscape by storm since its debut in 2012, and with private valuations hitting nearly $25 billion, investors should be anticipating what could be the biggest tech IPO of the year.Snapchat co-founder and CEO Evan Spiegel, alongside fellow founder and CTO Bobby Murphy, will lead his company through this important period. At just 26 and 28 years of age, Spiegel and Murphy are set to become some of the wealthiest under-30s in the world after Snap Inc. debuts; just how much their net worths will swell depends on how big the company's IPO can get, and we got a better sense of this size from its recent prospectus filing.(Also Read:Inside Snapchat: The Best Tech IPO of 2017?)The prospectus contained tons of juicy information, including key financial and membership data. For example, we learned that Snapchat now has about 158 million average daily active users and its annual revenue swelled to $404.4 million in 2016. We also know that Snapchat plans to list its shares in March under the ticker ""SNAP."" The company filed for $3 billion debut, but this is expected to be a placeholder until Snap Inc. prices the deal.All of this information is important to know and understand as investors think about investing in Snapchat at its IPO. However, the juiciest details in the prospectus were ones that not every investor expected to see or knew to look for. Check out these three key facts that you may have missed:1.It's a ""camera company"" … kind ofWhile most people would consider Snapchat a social media company, its prospectus proudly proclaimed that ""Snap Inc. is a camera company."" In the sense that Snapchat is inherently interested in its users' phone cameras, this is a logical statement; however, Snapchat is certainly not-nor does it seem interested in becoming-a major manufacturer of camera-based hardware.Sure, the company recently debuted its own line of camera-equipped sunglasses called ""Spectacles,"" but as its prospectus points out, 96% of revenue comes from advertising and that is unlikely to change soon. Do you know any other ""camera companies"" that rely on advertising revenue? Not really, which means Snapchat's labeling of itself as a ""camera company"" is more about its focus on the importance of the camera as a communicative device, not its business model.2.Mysterious third founder is goneThose who have followed Snapchat since its earliest days are probably already familiar with the impressive leadership of Spiegel and Murphy. However, every Snapchat-related story seems to include a mention of Reggie Brown, Snapchat's mysterious third founder who reportedly came up with the idea of disappearing photos.While we knew that Brown was no longer at the company, the prospectus finally revealed the full details on the situation, and it is a classic case of ""hush money"" that resembles the Winklevoss-Zuckerberg fiasco. According to the filing, Brown sued the company over intellectual property violations in February 2013. The parties involved eventually settled in September 2014, with Snap Inc. agreeing to pay Brown about $158 million in cash.3.They know their competitionOne of the key elements of a prospectus for a company like Snap Inc. is the information the company shares about its perceived challenges within its own industry. In that regard, it is clear that Snapchat is acutely aware of its competitors right now.The company underscores the dangers of competitors that ""mimic"" Snapchat's features throughout the report, and it uses a rhetoric of caution to describe the businesses that challenge it.""Many of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater resources and broader global recognition and occupy better competitive positions in certain markets than we do,"" the prospectus said, identifying FacebookFB, AppleAAPL, Alphabet Inc.GOOGL, LINELN, Twitter (TWTR), and many others as key foes.Final DetailsStartups like Snapchat benefit greatly from keeping their books closed and operating under the cover of being private, but the era is nearly over for Snap Inc., and the company will soon have many new shareholders to please.Looking ahead, we can expect a SNAP offering in March, and pricing details should come closer to that time. Other than that, we know that SNAP will be listed on the NYSE and some of the world's biggest banks, including Morgan StanleyMS, Goldman SachsGS, JPMorganJPM, Deutsche BankDB, BarclaysBCS, and Credit SuisseCS, are working on the deal.Which Stocks are Zacks Experts Talking   About?Stocks in today's headlines may be tempting buys, but how would you like a sneak peek at the stocks Zacks experts recommend?

3 Tech Stocks That Will Win as Qualcomm Collapses;2/3/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIt's often stated by motivational speakers that the Chinese word for ""crisis"" is composed of two characters - one signifying danger, the other opportunity. It's alsoembarrassingly inaccurate. This goes to show you that if the crux of an investment argument invokes ""the Chinese,"" stop! You might be getting had. Still, this ""Chinese philosophy"" is extremely relevant for tech stocks these days.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockThat's because semiconductor and digital communications giantQualcomm, Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM) is having a year to forget. Despite the fact that it's only early February, QCOM shares are down 18.5% year-to-date. Not surprisingly, Qualcomm is trading firmly below its 50- and 200-day moving averages. If something substantive doesn't happen soon, it risks repeating the disaster of 2015, when QCOM lost nearly 31%.The disaster that Qualcomm is currently facing was seen well in advance by those watching the industry closely. The crux of the issue is the company's technology licensing business. This is themost lucrativedivision for QCOM, accounting for the majority of its profits. By ""selling the rights to use patents that are essential to all modern mobile phone systems,"" QCOM had a monopoly. That's an incredible opportunity, so long as you don't get caught.Of course, they got caught. First, it was, you guessed it - the Chinese. Regulators in the world's second-biggest economy found Qualcomm guilty of violating theiranti-monopoly law. Then, individual companies began filing complaints. Finally, the Federal Trade Commission got involved in mid-January, claiming that QCOM illegally maintained a monopoly. Shares never looked the same after that, and who knows when Qualcomm will recover.Those are questions that analysts will squabble over. But for rival tech stocks, they only have one message - better you than me. It's not just the fact that a major competitor is falling. This is a classic case where an enemy of an enemy is a friend. Furthermore, the benchmarkTechnology SPDR (ETF)(NYSEARCA:XLK) is up 4.6% YTD. Granted, these aren't the best numbers, but it's much more preferable than what Qualcomm is going through.The Top 10 Dow Dividend Stocks for FebruaryWhile QCOM is swimming with the sharks, here are three tech stocks that are now set up to win big!Tech Stocks That Will Win as QCOM Falls: Apple Inc. (AAPL)Click to EnlargeUndoubtedly, of all the tech stocks that were affected by Qualcomm,Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands to be the biggest winner.On Jan. 20, AAPL filed suit against Qualcomm, alleging that the company ""withheld $1 billion in rebates in retaliation for Apple cooperating with Korean efforts to open the radio chip market."" Although it's difficult to call a stalwart like AAPL a ""victim,"" the pattern of allegations is pretty damning.First, we already saw Qualcomm violate foreign anti-competition laws, and pay dearly for it. Second, Korean manufacturerSamsung Electronics Co. Ltd(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) alleged similar shenanigans, although they later backed down. Finally, and most importantly, the FTC claimed that Qualcomm forced AAPL to use their chips to prevent competitor encroachment. For Qualcomm, Applr is its biggest customer, so the potential ramifications are deep and wide.Of course, Cupertino isn't going to shed any tears.Last October, AAPL ""reported its first decline in annual sales and profit in 15 years,"" according toThe Guardian. There are serious concerns that the king of consumer tech stocks has reached peak popularity. Whatever it is, Apple needs to boost its profitability. Getting out of unfavorable contracts is a good start.And with the world seemingly against Qualcomm, AAPL has an excellent chance of reviving itself at their expense.Tech Stocks That Will Win as QCOM Falls: Intel Corporation (INTC)Click to EnlargeAlthough I believe that Apple will get the most benefit out of the QCOM fiasco,Intel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) has a strong case as well. I wouldn't be surprised if most people viewed it as a toss-up between the two titans.Among tech stocks, INTC is one of the most recognizable, but for the wrong reasons. Everybody knows the ""Intel Inside"" slogan, but the only problem is that it relates to the aging personal computer business.It's a common challenge for consumer tech stocks - INTC needs to find new blood. The company'srevenue growthisn't the most consistent in the world. That's why the partnership last year between Intel and AAPL was a much-needed step in the right direction. Up until that point, Qualcomm was the sole provider of chips for the iPhone.In 2016, INTC stepped in to provide half the demand. Apparently, QCOM took exception to this arrangement; hence, the FTC charges of competitive foul play.So far, the market response towards Intel stock has been mixed. Therefore, I still give the advantage to Apple. Nevertheless, encouraging signs do exist. Yes, shares are down 4% from its high of the year. However, it's still very close to parity for the year. Furthermore, INTC remains inside a bullish trend channel that began in late summer of 2015.7 Stocks to Sell as Fear Returns to the MarketThe collapse at Qualcomm just gives other tech stocks more options, and Intel is happy to help.Tech Stocks That Will Win as QCOM Falls: Broadcom Ltd (AVGO)Click to EnlargeWhile virtually all tech stocks are affected by the Qualcomm crisis, few were as glued to their TV screens asBroadcom Ltd(NASDAQ:AVGO).As a semiconductor and communications company themselves, AVGO is a direct competitor and rival to QCOM.Naturally, if your primary nemesis goes down hard, it raises the boat for everyone else. And Qualcomm is sinking quite nicely for the Singapore-based firm.It's not just the fact that QCOM has transitioned into the world's most hated stock. Nor is it the money that they'll have to dish out in penalties. Rather, Qualcomm will be forced to fundamentally change its business plan. If it doesn't, government watchdogs are on standby, eager to pounce. That just gives AVGO and others a leg up. Maybe Broadcom is no saint. However, at the moment, the spotlight isn't on it, providing a margin of comfort.Most importantly, AVGO is making the most of its ""Chinese crisis."" On a YTD basis, shares are up a smoking 16% - that's almost the exact inverse of Qualcomm's results. Furthermore, Broadcom is trending inside a steadily rising channel. With so much ugliness associated with its primary rival, it's hard not to see anything but optimism for AVGO.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.The post3 Tech Stocks That Will Win as Qualcomm Collapsesappeared first onInvestorPlace."

If You Like Apple Inc., You’ll Love Skyworks Solutions Inc (AAPL, SWKS);2/3/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSuccessful stock market investing over the long term takes skills in several disciplines. First, you need to be able to think outside of the box by looking behind the headline stocks into lesser-known names operating behind the scenes.makeArticleAd();Now, I am certainly not saying to avoid the headline names. Getting in early on a favorite stock is a sure way to stock market profits. But often, once a stock starts making mainstream news headlines it's upward price momentum is about to slow or fail altogether.Identifying companies that support one or a combination of headline names yet do not get the same attention as the headliner is a consistent way to locate winning stocks for the long term.Once you locate your behind-the-news stock, it's time to take a close look at its fundamentals to make certain there is support behind the price move. Are the fundamentals improving over time? Are revenue and sales upward-trending from quarter to quarter? Do the products and services support an overall societal or economic trend? These are the basic questions to answer before making an investing decision.Next, make certain the share price is in an overall upward trend. This means judging whether the shares higher over the last year and by how much they are up relative to the headline name.Ideally, the stock should be outpacing the headliner price-performance wise and consistently making new highs on the daily price chart.I like stocks that are trading at or near their highs for one of my favorite investing tactics, trend following.I define trend following as buying stocks as they make new highs, then riding the upward trend and protecting profits via trailing stops. Certainly, there are many permutations of this basic method, such as waiting for a short term pullback to enter long, but for the purpose of this article, buying breakouts to new highs will suffice.The ideal trend-following stock isSkyworks Solutions Inc(SWKS). This stock holds the key to the future of the Internet of Things. It has soared over 42% in the last 52 weeks, and the company just keeps outperforming. With both strong fundamentals and robust technicals, if there ever was a stock made to order for the trend-following investing method, this is the one.The Top 10 Dow Dividend Stocks for FebruaryI found this company by first noticing that thatApple Inc.(AAPL) shares had posted over 35% gains in the last 52 weeks, despite the apparent slowdown in iPhone sales. This observation led me to look behind the headlines to see what companies Apple depends on as suppliers.Skyworks jumped out immediately, as it obtains approximately 40% of its revenue from Apple, and is also a supplier to Apple's Chinese smartphone competitors such as Huawei.The fact that shares of Skyworks had skyrocketed around 42% over the last year truly piqued my interest, and here's why…Skyworks specializes in connecting devices and technology, and experts are predicting there will be 70 billion internet connected devices by 2020. Called the Internet of Things, this burgeoning new web structure is expected to grow exponentially into the near future.Skyworks Solutions, Inc. officially describes itself as an analog semiconductor company powering the wireless networking revolution. Its innovative products are connecting people, places and things. These objects span some new and previously unimagined applications within the automotive, broadband, cellular infrastructure, connected home, industrial, medical, military, smartphone, tablet and wearable markets.The company posted strong results for its first fiscal quarter, with revenue for the first fiscal quarter at $914.3 million, up 9.4 percent sequentially and exceeding consensus estimates of $902.7 million.Operating income for the first fiscal quarter of 2017 was $321.9 million with diluted earnings per share of $1.38. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was also a record $495.9 million.""Skyworks delivered exceptional financial results in the first fiscal quarter of 2017 fueled by global demand for ubiquitous mobile connectivity and the Internet of Things,"" said Liam K. Griffin, president and chief executive officer of Skyworks. ""We are enabling the next phase of the wireless revolution, powering new and previously unimagined applications… Skyworks is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this connectivity megatrend.""The company also positively guided that it will beat consensus revenue and non-GAAP EPS estimates in its fiscal second quarter.Even better, the company just launched a $500 million stock buyback program that should further accelerate the upward price trend.Risks To Consider:Whenever one is investing in high tech, there is always a competitive risk. New companies with innovative products cause disruption in the high-tech sector on a consistent basis. The disruption can dethrone leading firms and cause havoc to share prices.Apple Inc. (AAPL) Smartwatch Is Still Dominant Despite All the DoubtAction To Take:Following the trend following theme, enter long on an upside break of $93.00 per share with an upside target of $135.00 per share.

How Options Traders Nailed Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Earnings;2/3/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIn a market known for its power of perfect pricing, nowhere is that more obvious than inAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN). But if you're looking for answers from AMZN stock, that's only one-half of this puzzling confirmation.makeArticleAd();Source: AmazonIf you're an Amazon shareholder, Friday's early morning low of $801 - off more than 4% - wasn't exactly money in the bank. AMZN stock is on the defensive followinglast night's earnings release, which put investors into profit-taking mode.AMZN Stock by the NumbersAmazon reported better-than-expected profits of $1.54, beating the Street view by 17 cents. Sales, on the other hand, were short of estimates, at $43.7 billion versus a $44.68 billion bar. For the full year, though, profits quadrupled on a 27% increase in revenues.The company's operating income outlook has possibly raised some hairs on the backs of AMZN bulls. A forecast of $250 million to $900 million falls well below the Street's consensus of $1.33 billion. But it's not as bad as it looks, as most of the ""warning"" is tied to aggressive investments in media, fulfillment and India.As well, while investors are failing to rejoice Friday, Amazon also delivered the goods with its operating cash flow, which jumped by 38% to $16.4 billion.7 Stocks to Sell as Fear Returns to the MarketWhat's more, revenues of $3.54 billion from its coveted Amazon Web Services (AWS) unit climbed an impressive 47% over last year's same-quarter result of $2.41 billion, while contributing 9% to Amazon's net revenues for the year.By the ""Other"" Numbers …That said, Amazon's report hasn't been nearly as punishing from the standpoint of professional options traders.Based on last night's 03 Feb $840 straddle market, pricing of $42 for the non-directional spread with AMZN stock at $840 amounted to traders putting the over/under bet at 5% or estimated range from $798 to $882. This weekly contract, which expires today, is the purest play on the earnings event and collectively tells us what traders expect for Amazon shares in the immediate aftermath of the announcement.Further, as most often it's the professional options traders and market makers that sell options premiums, the basic assumption is this more informed and disciplined group is collectively wagering on the ""under"" side of the 5% in AMZN stock.So far, not only has Friday's low of $801 in Amazon shares fallen within the forecast by options traders, but relative to past earnings events of the last few years, call and put premiums were decidedly below average.Thehistorical recordshows that over the past five years, the average up or down move in Amazon stock has been 8.4%, with a median reaction of 8.1%. Fine-tuning the price activity down to the last five quarters, AMZN's average move has been slightly higher at 9%, but a modestly lower median of 7.7%.AMZN Stock Daily ChartClick to EnlargeFinally, Friday's conditions in Amazon shares may not have been as fierce as we've been led to believe.Take a look at the accompanying chart. Ifcharts don't lie, then AMZN stockclearlywas a double-top pattern.I'm being facetious, of course. But even if I wasn't, I'd always look to hedge my directional bet with options and money management opportunities in case I read a chart like Amazon's with less-than-perfect forecasting.Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in any of the securities or their derivatives mentioned in this article.

Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock: 2 Reasons to Steer Clear;2/3/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAdvanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ:AMD) is coming off a fourth-quarter earnings beat in which the company reported $1.1 billion in revenue. AMD stock bounced 16% to above the $12 level as a result, continuing a red-hot streak of nearly 500% returns in just 52 weeks.makeArticleAd();Source:Matthew Rutledge via FlickrThis was a sub-$2 stockjust a year agoamid fears about competition and potential bankruptcy.AMD is a leading maker of graphics cards, including Radeon for consumers and FirePro for workstations. The company operates in two segments: Computing and Graphics, which makes desktop and notebook processors and professional graphics; andEnterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom, producing server chips, embedded processors for the Internet of Things and chips for gaming consoles.Since taking the helm two years ago, Advanced Micro Devices CEOLisa Su-  an MIT-educated electrical engineer who has authored over 40 technical papers - has presided over a remarkable recovery. Now, AMD, having played second fiddle toIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) for decades, ismaking a playfor the PC and server markets, Intel's bread and butter. AMD's Ryzen CPU will challenge Intel's Core i5 and i7 chips.AMD is moving up the value chain amid a falling PC market, going from low-end to high-end PC processors .Even if prospects for Advanced Micro Devices' business are good, though, investors have to deal with a few issues. AMD hasn't posted an operating profit since the third quarter of 2014, holds a great deal of debt and yet trades at a stratospheric valuation.Amid these high expectations and gains worthy of bubble talk, is AMD stock still a buy? Here are two problems that should have the bulls taking a second look.AMD Has a Not-Great Balance SheetDespite many chipmakers such as AMD going ""fabless"" and outsourcing the fabrication of their chips to contract manufacturers such asTaiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd. (ADR)(NYSE:TSM), the industry remains capital-intensive.7 Stocks to Sell as Fear Returns to the MarketAdvanced Micro Devices escaped bankruptcy last year. It took advantage of low interest rates and improved investor confidence to restructure its debt in September 2016. AMD issued$600 million in sharesand $450 million in convertible senior notes. This enabled AMD to pay off $676 million in debt due in 2020. So instead of $600 million in AMD debt maturing in 2019, only $196 million will mature that year.Still, AMD is highly leveraged by several measures. With $1.435 billion in long-term debt and $416 million in shareholder equity as of Dec. 31, 2016, AMD's long-term debt-to-equity ratio stands at 3.44. That figure is much lower for Intel, at 0.38, andNvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA), at 0.37, indicating less leverage. Likewise, AMD's debt-to-capital ratio of 0.775 stands above 0.27 for both INTC and NVDA.Intel and Nvidia also are better able to service debt. For the year ended December 31, 2016, AMD generated only $90 million in operating cash flow, with $2.9 billion in total liabilities, a ratio of 0.031.NVDA earned $1.462 billion in operating cash flow for the four quarters ended October 30, 2016, with $4.24 billion in total liabilities, a ratio of 0.34.Intel showed an even healthier balance sheet, with $19.09 billion in operating cash flow for $48 billion in total liabilities, a ratio of 0.396.AMD Stock Is Much More ExpensiveNvidia and Intel are profitable and have a better track record of generating operating cash flow. They earned positive operating cash flow in the four most recent quarters, while AMD's operating cash flow went negative for two quarters.Still, AMD stock trades at a huge premium to both.AMD trades at a whopping 25.66 times book, versus 11.5 for Nvidia (which itself is high), and 2.61 for Intel. It's not difficult to justify a higher price than Intel given AMD's growth prospects, but for comparison's sake, know that while Wall Street sees Advanced Micro Devices growing revenues roughly 10% this year and next, NVDA should be sitting at roughly 37% annual sales growth after it reports Q4 earnings, with analysts expecting that to slow to ""only"" 16% next year.ConclusionIt's difficult to fight the momentum, but you might just want to in AMD stock. At this point, anyone tussling with Advanced Micro Devices is playing with overpriced fire.Should You Buy FireEye Inc (FEYE) Stock? 3 Pros, 3 ConsFrom a valuation standpoint, INTC actually looks like the best buy, simply because the market expects less from it than from AMD and NVDA. Also, Intel leads in the production of microprocessors, and this matters in the semiconductor industry, since often only the market leaders can turn a profit, while laggards destroy value.AMD made some mistakes in the past, switching back and forth between ARM and x86 architectures, and never was quite able to catch up to Intel. The stock looks promising, but dislodging Intel and showing a steady track record of profits will not be easy in this industry.As of this writing, Lucas Hahn did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace7 Awful Stocks You Need To Ditch Right AwayExxon Mobil Corporation (XOM) Stock Is Going to BounceApple Inc.

Apple Inc. (AAPL) Smartwatch Is Still Dominant Despite All the Doubt;2/3/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhenApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) CEO Tim Cook went on the attack against claims Apple Watch sales were in the dumpster his comments about record holiday sales were taken with a healthy dose of skepticism.makeArticleAd();Source: AppleAfter all, it was his job to talk up his company's products. Even a similar claim in Apple's Q1 earnings report seemed questionable, with no detail provided. However, a report on global smartwatch shipments for Q4 2016 supports AAPL's claims.The numbers say Apple Watch sales did indeed set a holiday record and took an even larger share of overall smartwatch sales that quarter than in the 2015 holidays.Defending Apple Watch SalesTim Cook had his work cut out for him after AAPL launched the Apple Watch Series 2 in September. Apple was counting on the new model to boost sales going into the holiday quarter of a year where consumer interest in smartwatches was slipping.Alphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) opted to skip its expected Android Wear 2 smartwatch operating system upgrade.Pebble, the early smartwatch pioneer, would soon collapse and have its assets bought up byFitbit Inc(NYSE:FIT).When research firm IDC released a report in December saying Apple Watch sales had tanked, dropping 71% from the previous year, Cook went on the offensive.In an e-mailtoReuters, he wrote:""Our data shows that Apple Watch is doing great and looks to be one of the most popular holiday gifts this year. Sales growth is off the charts. In fact, during the first week of holiday shopping, our sell-through of Apple Watch was greater than any week in the product's history. And as we expected, we're on track for the best quarter ever for Apple Watch.""The problem was, with a new model just launched and the crucial holiday shopping season ramping up, everyone was expecting AAPL to put a positive spin on Apple Watch sales. And without numbers to back it up, Cook's statement wasn't necessarily taken at face value.10 Companies That Are Bringing Jobs Back to AmericaEven Apple's Q1 earnings report, where the Apple Watch was noted to have set an ""all-time revenue record"" didn't convince everyone. AAPL didn't spike out any actual number to back that up and the Other division that includes the Apple Watch saw its revenue drop 8% year-over-year.AAPL Wasn't Blowing Smoke About Apple Watch SalesResearch firm Strategy Analytics released itsreport on global smartwatch shipments for Q4, 2016(the period corresponding to AAPL's Q1 2017). In it, global smartwatch sales are shown to have recovered from a slow first half, to mark a 1% increase over 2015. As for the Apple Watch?""Demand for Apple's new Watch Series 2 as a holiday-season gift in Western markets was surprisingly strong and it enabled Apple to clear a large backlog of smartwatch inventory during the quarter.""According to Strategy Analytics, that translated to a record 5.2 million Apple Watch sales in the fourth quarter, up from 5.1 million the previous year. In addition, while AAPL lost ground in the overall smartwatch market in 2016 - dropping to a 55% share compared to over 65% in 2015 by selling 2 million fewer smartwatches on the year - during the holiday quarter, the company captured over 63% of all smartwatch sales.Where Does This Leave AAPL and the Apple Watch?Apple is still the dominant smartwatch maker, and the Apple Watch Series 2 showed the company isn't sitting still. Its overall market share dropped to 55%, but it remains firmly on top.Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Has a New Hero: Services!Second placeSamsung Electronics Co Ltd(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) took a big hit over the holiday quarter, despite releasing a new model of its own, the Gear S3. Samsung's holiday quarter marketshare dropped from 16% to 9.8%, while its overall marketshare for 2016 dropped from 13% to 11.4%. A collection of other manufacturers from Fitbit toLGtook over one third of the market in 2016 (up from 21.6%) showing the increasing diversification of smartwatch sales.The smartwatch market still isn't setting the world on fire, but despite a slow 2016, any reports of its death are greatly exaggerated. And while AAPL is sharing the market with an increasingly diverse group of competitors, Apple Watch sales have not cratered. They were down overall for the year, but Apple maintained a dominant position and the new Apple Watch Series 2 did indeed propel the company to record smartwatch sales over the holidays.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceIs Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Ending the Age of Intel (INTC)?Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Steps on Amazon and Google's TurfThe postApple Inc.

GoPro (GPRO) Q4 Results Mixed with Earnings Beat & View Cut;2/3/2017;"After four back-to-back quarters of posting quarterly losses,GoPro, Inc.GPROmanaged to get back in the green as it posted adjusted earnings of 16 cents per share in its fourth-quarter 2016 results. The action camera maker's bottom-line figure beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 12 cents by an impressive 33%.However, the earnings figure was a result of several adjustments made to the huge GAAP loss that GoPro reported (82 cents per share).Shares tumbled almost 14% at one point in late trading in the aftermath of the results, as investors were disillusioned with the company's bleak sales outlook for first-quarter 2017. This was in spite of the fact that this was the second biggest quarter in terms of revenue in GoPro's history. The drab guidance must have spooked investors as 2017 was supposed to be a turnaround time for GoPro and this is a terrible start to the same.In addition, investors were likely upset with the multiple missed opportunities and goof-ups that GoPro had this quarter.The huge GAAP loss of 82 cents for the quarter was much wider than the 25 cents loss generated in the comparable quarter last year.For full-year 2016, the company reported a non-GAAP net loss of $1.44 per share, in stark contrast to net income of 76 cents in 2015.Inside the HeadlinesGoPro's revenues grew 23.8% from the prior-year quarter's tally to $540.6 million. This marked the company's return to revenue growth after four successive quarters of sales declines. The top-line figure still lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $576 million.This was the first quarter that reflected the performance of the recently launched Hero5 camera and its consumer drone Karma, and revenues were far short of the company's earlier guidance of $625 million. The Karma recall hit the top line and manufacturing issues related to Hero5 camera also strained growth.Nevertheless, Hero5 Black was the best-selling digital imaging device in units and dollars in the U.S. and Europe. Also, Hero5 Black sold more units in a single quarter in Europe, in this quarter, than any other GoPro camera ever.For the quarter, non-GAAP gross margins expanded 990 bps year over year to 39.5%. Non-GAAP operating income came in at $31.6 million, as against an operating loss of $21.6 million generated last year.R&D expenses were up almost 40% year over year, driven by investment in HERO5 cameras, Karma, accessories and software. In addition, sales and marketing expenses shot up 36% year over year.The company recently launched GoPro Plus - a cloud-based subscription service - that enables auto-upload of footage from a GoPro camera to a GoPro Plus cloud account for on-the-go access, editing and sharing using a smartphone and the Quik app. Even though it is early days, the GoPro Plus is enjoying high retention rates in the U.S. and its subscriber base seems to be expanding.In the quarter, the rebranded Quik mobile app was downloaded over 4 million times (up almost 30% sequentially), as its active users and monthly exports tripled in Dec 2016 over the prior year.For full-year 2016, revenues plunged 26.8% year over year to $1.62 billion.Notable DevelopmentsTill date, GoPro's Hero 5 Black cameras and Karma drones have faced production issues and delayed shipments, which restrained the company's ability to meet demand in the quarter. The company's new products also had a rocky start with Amazon.com Inc.AMZN, as GoPro had temporarily stopped selling them on the e-commerce site in mid October due to a pricing dispute.Further, supply constraints made retailers cancel marketing support of GoPro's new products, particularly its new Hero 5 camera, which obviously hurt revenues. Further, the company had to announce a recall of its new Karma drone after a mere fortnight of its commercial launch, as a few of them lost power during flight due to battery issues. This was also a huge setback for the company.However, earlier this week, the company resumed Karma sales and the company plans to ramp production further. Karma is scheduled to be available in international markets this spring. We believe that GoPro is well set to capitalize on the fast-growing consumer drone market.The company also launched several accessories during the quarter, including Karma Grip, a handheld stabilizer; Remo, a waterproof, voice-activated remote and Quik Key, a microSD card reader enabling quick editing and sharing from smartphones.LiquidityExiting the quarter, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $192.1 million, down significantly from $280 million a year back.GuidanceIn light of such unfortunate events and uncertain market reaction, the company gave a very disappointing guidance for first-quarter 2017. It projects revenues for the current quarter in the range of $190-$210 million, which is well below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $268 million for the quarter. The company expects gross margin in the low 30% range.GoPro refrained from offering specific revenue or margin guidance for full-year 2017.However, GoPro declared plans to limit its adjusted operating expenses in 2017 to $600 million, in an attempt to try to return to full-year profitability next year. This is comparable to a 2016 figure of about $709 million.GoPro should be able to attain these massive cost reductions, in light of its recent business restructuring, which did away with many high-cost operations including its entertainment division.It is likely that GoPro's sales will gradually improve as it ramps production and expands Karma's reach to international markets. This will supplement its cost-reduction initiatives and enable it to achieve sustained, profitable growth.GoPro, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseGoPro, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise|GoPro, Inc. QuoteOur TakeIn recent months, the company has been grappling to achieve its earlier growth and go beyond its trademark action cameras. GoPro had earlier reduced its inventory of older legacy cameras, in order to prepare for its new products. However, what followed was more operational stumbles and messed-up products launches.The company has also been facing pressure to establish a more mainstream market for its cameras. However, tough competition from smartphone brands such as Apple Inc.AAPLand Samsung Electronics Corp. has been making it difficult for the company.Despite all the problems that GoPro is straining under, the company is confident of strong demand trajectory for its latest products and is expecting to return to double-digit growth in 2017.However big the issues it faces, GoPro still boasts an enviable retail presence. Extremely few consumer technology companies have the kind of retail presence that GoPro has and this might work in favour of the company. Whether this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock can successfully build a market for its new products and return to sustainable growth, remains to be seen.A better-ranked stock in the Zacks categorizedAudio/Video Home Productsindustry is Dolby Laboratories, Inc.DLB.

Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Moved Too Far, Too Fast;2/3/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) reportedearnings Tuesdayof $3.38 per share on revenues of $78.35 billion. Both of these metrics were significant beats as consensus expectations were $3.22 EPS and $76.2 billion in sales. Apple stock initially shot up nearly 9 points, or 7.5%, post earnings and briefly traded above the critical $130 before pulling back.makeArticleAd();Source:via AppleWhile the earnings report certainly was solid, the reaction of AAPL stock was a case of too far, too fast. I look for Apple stock to continue to have difficulties moving appreciably higher over the coming months.As mentioned, AAPL reported a stellar quarter. While revenues beat tempered analysts expectations, the actual revenues rose by only 5% year over year. Important to add that this quarter had an extra weekend in the reporting period, meaning overall revenue growth was rather stagnant.With any company, but especially the largest U.S. market cap company such as AAPL, the law of large numbers certainly begins to apply when projecting future growth. With Apple now trading at the highest price/sales ratio (and the first time over 3) in the past year, investors are paying a hefty comparative price for AAPL stock.5 Stocks to Buy to Defy a Weak FebruaryA P/E comparative paints a similar picture, with AAPL stock now trading above a 15 multiple.Technically, AAPL stock definitely looks toppy at the $130 level. After a stunning 20% rise from the Nov. 14 lows of $105.71, Apple stock encountered some significant resistance at the $130 level. This was a major area of resistance back in the first half of 2015 as well.Apple is also extremely overbought, with a 14 day RSI well over 80. Previous instances when AAPL was this overbought proved to be significant short-term tops in Apple stock. Yesterday's price action, with the stock trading higher only to reverse and close lower on the day, also points to exhaustion in the rally.While I am not looking for a dramatic pullback in AAPL stock, I also think the rally has gotten more than a little ahead of itself. A period of sideways consolidative price action is likely in store.One of the benefits of options is that you can structure a trade to make, as Dire Straits famously said, money for nothing. So to position for AAPL to struggle to head higher over the next month, a short-term bear call spread makes intuitive sense.AAPL Stock Trade IdeaBuy May $145 calls and sell May $140 calls for a 60-cent net credit or better.Trade of the Day: AK Steel Holding Corporation (AKS) Stock Looks Like a BargainMaximum gain on the trade is $60 per spread with maximum risk of $440 per spread. Return on risk is 13.63%. The short $140 strike price is nearly 9% above the Thursday closing price of $128.53 and also well above the $130 resistance level.I would close out the trade on a significant move to new all-time highs on AAPL while looking to let the spread expire worthless and keep the initial $60 premium if AAPL remains well behaved.As of this writing, Tim Biggam did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Apple Inc. (AAPL) Could Be a Step Closer to Booting Intel From Macs;2/3/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIt's an idea that has been around for several years now: replace theIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) chips currently powering Mac computers with ARM chips fromARM Holdings plc (ADR)(NASDAQ:ARMH). Doing so would have many advantages forApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL). According to aBloombergreport, the prospect of ARM CPUs in Macs is getting closer, with AAPL working on a new chip that would independently control a MacBook's low power mode.makeArticleAd();Source: ARM HoldingsWhether you think it's a great idea or a head scratcher, theTouch Baris the tentpole feature of Apple's new MacBook Pro. The Touch Bar is an OLED strip that replaces the laptop's function keys with a programmable touch display, with virtual buttons based on the application currently being run. It also incorporates a fingerprint reader.And the Touch Bar is powered by the T1, Apple's first ARM-based Mac chip.New ARM CPUs in Macs?Bloombergis now reporting thatAAPL engineers are taking the next step toward ARM in Mac, by having the ""Power Nap"" mode controlled by an ARM chip. Power Nap is a feature that lets Mac laptops run basic background functions such as retrieving e-mail and installing software updates, while closed and sleeping. By shifting control of Power Nap from the Intel CPU to an ARM chip, less power is used and MacBook battery would last longer.Why the excitement about the possibility of Apple making a complete switch and replacing Intel processors with ARM CPUs in Macs?ARM in Mac: The PayoffsThere are many compelling reasons, includingthose laid out last yearby theMacObserver. ARM chips power all of Apple's mobile devices, so switching to ARM CPUs in Macs would simplify and unify code development between MacOS and iOS.10 Companies That Are Bringing Jobs Back to AmericaIntel has moved away from tick-tock processor development cycles, so it may not be moving forward fast enough for Apple's needs. Modern, 64-bit ARM processors are becoming competitive with Intel on power, including the power needed to run an operating system like Windows in a virtual environment; therefore, ARM in Mac wouldn't have to mean Macs lose the option to runMicrosoft Corporation's(NASDAQ:MSFT) Windows.Then there's cost. In a post dating back to 2015AppleInsiderbroke down thepotential financial gain should Apple ditch Intel. It estimated the cost of the A-series chips used in the iPhone and iPad at roughly $25, while Intel CPUs used in Macs were somewhere in the $180 to $300 range.The site points to the Apple TV as an example of Apple making the switch. The first generation ran a version of OS X on Intel processors. For the second generation, AAPL switched to an ARM-based A4 chip running iOS. That move shrunk the Apple TV size and knocked the price from $299 to $99. The numbers may have changed a little since then, but the same basic math applies: ARM is considerably cheaper.Will Apple Ditch Intel?There would be many risks in switching to ARM CPUs in Macs. Even if AAPL did make that decision, it would still need Intel CPUs for a number of years while it made the transition across the Mac product line - and Intel would be able to stick it to Apple for those chips. There would be challenges around integrating ARM chips with high-end graphics cards like those made byNvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA). Other third-party hardware would also require work.Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Has a New Hero: Services!There is also the issue of manufacturing capacity: AAPL's suppliers would need to be able to pick up the slack from Intel and churn out the needed ARM chips.However, as intense as all this sounds, it's worth remembering that AAPL has done it all before. Twice! The company transitioned the entire Mac platform from 68k to PowerPC in 1998, and then from PowerPC to Intel in 2005.ARM CPUs in Macs aren't a reality yet, but with the new ARM chips rumored for MacBooks, it seems as though AAPL is testing the waters. With Nvidia already causing it grief byturning its video cards into high-powered CPU-bustersand Microsoft once again trying for a version ofWindows on ARM processors, Intel has to be watching the ARM in Mac situation with more than a little consternation.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceMicrosoft Corporation (MSFT) Steps on Amazon and Google's TurfApple Inc.

Apple Inc's iPad Business Isn't as Bad as It Looks;2/3/2017;"Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) reported a strong quarter, driven by   better-than-expected demand in its key product line, the iPhone.   However, while investors often pay far more attention to the   iPhone business than to any of the company's other segments, it's   important to watch the others nonetheless.Apple's 9.7-inch iPad Pro. Image source: Apple.makeArticleAd();That includes the iPad business.Apple reported a 19% year-over-year drop in iPad unit   shipments and a full 22% year-over-year drop in iPad revenue,   making it the company's worst-performing business unit by far.   Although these results are quite disappointing -- making it   increasingly difficult to have confidence in the future of this   product line -- the business isn't in as dire shape as it   appears.Channel inventory dynamicsIn Apple's most recent quarter, it shipped 13.08 million   iPads, down from 16.12 million in the same period a year ago. One   of the drivers of the steep year-over-year drop was channel   inventory dynamics. Remember that Apple ships products to   distributors (i.e., channel partners), and then those   distributors sell those products to end customers. To get a   true sense of underlying customer demand, it's important to not   just watch the change in unit shipments but the amount of   inventory that's sitting out there in the hands of Apple's   channel partners.With that in mind, Apple says that in the most recent quarter,   the companyreducediPad channel inventories by 700,000 units. The company says that   in the year-ago quarter, Apple hadboostedits channel inventory levels by 900,000 units.So to get a sense of the underlying demand, we can adjust the   numbers to account for the channel inventory changes. Apple   shipped 13.08 iPads, but channel inventories were down 700,000   units, which suggests that actual demand was more like 13.78   million units. Performing the same math for the year-ago   quarter, Apple increased channel inventory by 900,000 units,   meaning that underlying customer demand was 15.22 million   units.To be clear, demand wasstilldown year-over-year and that's far from ideal, but adjusting for   these channel inventory dynamics, it looks like the decline was   ""just"" 9.4%.Product cycle dynamicsAnother factor that impacted the iPad results, at least   according to CEO Tim Cook, were product cycle dynamics.On the earnings call, Cook explained that in the year-ago   quarter, Apple had just launched its 12.9-inch iPad Pro, which he   reminded investors is ""the iPad with, obviously, the highest   price on it"".""We would have done the channel fill plus the launch of the   product, and so that would have bolstered [average selling   prices] in that particular quarter"", Cook said.Indeed, Apple reported that in addition to iPad units being   down 19%, iPad revenue was down 22% in the most recent quarter,   suggesting a weaker product mix. Cook's commentary absolutely   makes sense here, especially as demand for the 12.9-inch model is   probably well below where it was when it first launched.Looking aheadOn the call, Cook tried to reassure investors that the company   has ""some exciting things coming on iPad"" and that he is ""very   optimistic about where [Apple] can take the product"".Unfortunately, Apple management has been bullish about the   iPad business for a while now, but it's still hard to see where   the bottom will ultimately be and even harder to predict how much   the business can grow once it hits that bottom.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Investors Turned 'Very Bullish' On Tech ETFs In January Amid Earnings;2/3/2017;"[ibd-display-video id=453308]ETF investors bet big on technology stocks ahead of earnings   reports from marquee names in January. Powered by demand for the   iPhone 7 Plus,Apple(AAPL) delivered supersize results on Jan. 31 and saw its shares   soar.Technology was the strongest S&P 500 sector in terms of   flow of money as the new year got underway, according to Sector   SPDRs. Investors last month poured $897.3 million into   Technology Select Sector SDPR (XLK), the largest and most active exchange traded fund for exposure   to this sector.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');This marked a significant reversal from 2016, when investors   yanked nearly $900 million from XLK for the year, said   Dan Dolan of Sector SPDRs. Trading activity in XLK so far   this year suggests thatETF   investorsare ""very bullish"" on the technology sector, in his view.""In addition to the flows, the short positions declined by   27%"" in January, Dolan told IBD via email. ""Earnings have been   very good,"" he pointed out, ""for most of the big names.""Those names includeMicrosoft(MSFT) andIntel(INTC) - tech stalwarts reinventing themselves for a new cloud-driven,   Internet of Things era - as well as chipmakersAdvanced Micro Devices(AMD),Texas Instruments(TXN),Microsemi(MSCC),Lam Research(LRCX) andKLA-Tencor(KLAC).Outliers includedAlphabet(GOOGL) andQualcomm(QCOM), which delivered mixed results.Tech earnings are tracking higher, at 9.6%, than the 6.6%   expected at the start of the Q4 season, according to CFRA   Research. And XLK's 4.3% year-to-date gain, vs. 1.8% for SPDR   S&P 500 (SPY), reflects investors's optimism   about improving industry fundamentals.[ibdchart symbol=""xlk"" type=""daily"" size=""quarter""   position=""leftchart"" ]While earnings season has put technology   companies under a spotlight, the macro outlook is   driving interest too.Technology stocks are expected to benefit from the economic   strength that tends to go hand-in-hand with periods of rising   interest rates.""As business spending picks up, as consumer confidence grows   and consumption increases, tech companies will be the   beneficiaries of those trends,"" said Todd Rosenbluth, director of   ETF research at CFRA. Other tailwinds include the promise of   corporate tax reform and repatriation of foreign cash under   President Trump, which disproportionately benefits the tech   sector, Rosenbluth pointed out.Apple CFO Luca Maestri noted   at Tuesday's earnings call that 94% of   his company's record $246.1 billion cash pile is stashed   abroad. Under a Trump proposal, the iPhone   maker could potentially bring home foreign earnings at   a special tax rate of 10%, instead of up to 35%. That tax holiday   could be one of the single biggest catalysts for the sector going   forward, CFRA analysts say.Risks to the sector include the uncertainty surrounding   Trump's vision for economic renewal, the crimp that a   strengthening dollar could put on global IT spending, and the   onslaught of low-cost rivals such as Huawei in key foreign   markets.Investors who remain bullish on the sector's outlook have four   dozen ETFs to choose from. Many of the new launches make   extremely focused bets in extremely small industry niches -   3D printing or Big Data or wearable devices, for example.In Rosenbluth's view, most investors would do well to stick   with a technology ETF offering broadly diversified exposure to   the sector, and to then layer on thematic ETFs in   specific tech industries.Investors have been seeking diversification. Two tech   ETFs far outpaced their peers last year by gathering more   than $1 billion apiece in fresh assets, and both hold a   broad basket of tech stocks. But they take markedly different   approaches to investing in the sector.Vanguard Information Technology (VGT) tracks a   market-cap-weighted index of U.S. tech companies,   including more small- and microcap stocks than most other   broad tech ETFs. It invests $10.75 billion in assets across 366   stocks for an extremely low 0.10% expense ratio.First Trust Nasdaq-100 Tech Sector (QTEC) follows an   equal-weighted index of Nasdaq-listed U.S. technology stocks. It   has virtually no exposure to small- and microcap stocks, but has   a significant midcap stake. At 0.60%, its expense ratio is among   the highest in the segment.Investors should be aware that ETFs may sound alike   but offer very different exposures, which affects their   performance, Rosenbluth says.QTEC rose 25% in 2016, nearly double the gains of its   Vanguard peer. It benefited in part from its extreme overweight   to the semiconductor industry.Looking ahead, Rosenbluth believes VGT may benefit more than   other broad-based peers from an improving U.S. economy,   given its larger stake in smaller tech companies.XLK and VGT made a 52-week high on thestock marketon Jan. 27.RELATED:High-Yield Strategy Uses 10 ETFs To Deliver     All-Weather Income With Low Risk7 Best ETFs For Your Growth And Income Needs As     Trump Takes The Wheel"

Stock Exchange: Navigation Help For The Challenging Trump Waters;2/3/2017;"ByJeff Miller:Our lastStock Exchange(two weeks ago) discussed diverse ideas from our experts, and also explained why I vetoed one of the recommendations. When trading using models, you can link directly to a platform if you do many trades and have a very short time frame. Otherwise, you should not blindly follow the model. A human who understands the factors used by the model can identify when a situation is truly exceptional.The current market environment is all about Trump - perhaps excessively so. Everyone worries about what companies are vulnerable to a tweet (which we will call aT-WOP, HT @corporatecommie). Each day includes more speculation about companies that might benefit from policy changes.How should traders find a sweet spot in this environment?makeArticleAd();This week includes both new ideas and reviews of some past highlights. Everyone can benefit from finding the trading model most relevant for your own style.Let's look at the ideas from our experts. As usual, I will conclude with a brief observation.Getting UpdatesWe have a new (free) service to subscribers to our Felix/Oscar update list. You can suggest three favorite stocks and sectors. We report regularly on the ""favorite fifteen"" in each category - stocks and sectors - as determined by readers. Sign up with email to ""etf at newarc dot com."" Suggestions and comments are welcome. In the tables below, green is a ""buy,"" yellow a ""hold,"" and red a ""sell."" Each category represents about 1/3 of the underlying universe. Please remember that these are responses to reader requests, not necessarily stocks and sectors that we own. Sign up now to vote your favorite stock or sector onto the list!This Week-Finding Your Trading Sweet SpotHolmesThis week I'm buying good ol' U.S.A. Macys (M). This stock probably needs no introduction - Main Street retail store.This chart strikes me as a great money-making opportunity. My major concern is that this stock keeps making lower lows, but in the meantime, it can have some terrific rallies. I see no reason it can't get back to the mid-$30s. It's a little comforting to know that there are 18 analyst holds on this stock and their target price is STILL $36. That is consistent with what the charts are telling me.I'm buying here with a tight stop, $29.25, and looking for a move back into the mid-$30s, giving me a nice risk/reward setup.J: I agree with you about ignoring the analyst ratings. I use it as a contra-indicator. Did you read that recent WSJ article?H: You know that I do not read! I reach great conclusions from looking at charts. You humans read, but mostly to reaffirm your existing biases.J: I am delighted that our clients caught this at a lower price, but do you realize the stock was up over $1.50 today?H: No. I am enjoying the beach in Mexico. I sent in my pick, but that is like working overtime.J: Oscar's turf accountant would call your choice ""past posting.""H: Sorry. You are the one who set the schedule for Thursdays. I made the pick earlier, and it is still a good buy.J: There is a rumor of a possible takeover. Did you know about that?H: No. I just know a great rebound chart when I see one.J: Are you going to have any trouble returning from Mexico? The U.S. is taking a hard look at those returning from other countries.H: My papers are all in order. I'll be back in the office in a week or so.AthenaI admit it. I still have no new picks. We do not have the fresh, strongly trending stocks that I prefer. I'm still holding most of my most recent picks, and I have room for one more buy.J: Maybe you could give us an update on one of your current holdings.A: Fair enough. Irecommended United Rentals (URI) on 12/22  , after buying it myself a few days earlier.J: Isn't this one of your few picks where I agreed?A: Yes, I seem to remember that you said the pick was OK, but you did not own it yourself. I have held this one through a month or so of sideways movement, but now it's starting to pay off in a big way. We've seen an increase of roughly 20% in the last two weeks. That means it's about time for me to hop off this one (as fun of a ride as it's been).J: That certainly worked well. How are you doing overall?A: Not as well as the fussy guy and the dog, but that will change soon. I think I am Vince's favorite.FelixI will once again begin with my responses to reader votes for the favorites list.My list provides rankings within each zone, as well as the basics about buy, hold, and sell. The list includes the top overall vote getters from our (free) subscription list as well as some new requests I got during the week.J: The list has some interesting changes. I see that Apple (AAPL) (which we own) is still in ""hold"" territory despite the major rally after its earnings report.F: My ratings came before the report. How about Amazon (AMZN)? That did not do so well. My approach is geared to the long term, usually more than one year.J: Fair enough. Do you have something new for us this week?F: No.J: What? I took a long weekend, but the rest of you were supposed to keep working. Only Holmes was on vacation.F: I worked, but there are no new choices. Patience is called for.J: Are you trying to get dropped from the weekly discussion?F: You would not dare! My performance leads the group. In addition, I provide updated information to my many fans. You should be giving me a raise. I am on the job while the dog is in Mexico.J: OK, we'll let the readers decide whether they still want your opinions.OscarMy pick for this week is the Defense sector, shown here by the SPDR S&P Aerospace & Defense ETF (XAR). I liked this one back in early December too - but I got out before the downslide. Now that the price has had a few weeks to level out, I feel more comfortable getting back into this sector.For my next ""investment"" - I'll bet that Belichick can't put together a defense to stop the Falcons. But that really is another subject…Here are my ratings for the top reader interests. Keep the questions coming. My sectors are aggressive, but have less risk than Felix's picks. I avoid the bad news from random, single-stock moves.J: Interesting. Do you see evidence of that?O: I hear about it. People are very worried about something called ""tweets"" that seem to hit their stocks for no reason. Playing sectors reduces that risk.J: Interesting. The Tweeter-in-Chief has T-Wopped a few of the defense stocks, but most still believe in his support for higher defense spending.O: I only follow sports tweets, but I know which sectors have legs, and which will fail down the stretch.J: You really like the Falcons?O: My week's pay is on the line!Background on the Stock ExchangeEach week Felix and Oscar host a poker game for some of their   friends. Since they are all traders they love to discuss their   best current ideas before the game starts. They like to call this   their ""Stock Exchange."" (Check it out for more background). Their methods are   excellent, as you know if you have been following the series.   Since the time frames and risk profiles differ, so do the stock   ideas. You get to be a fly on the wall from my report. I am the   only human present, and the only one using any fundamental   analysis.The result? Several expert ideas each week from traders, and a   brief comment on the fundamentals from the human investor. The   models are named to make it easy to remember their trading   personalities. Each week features a different expert or   stock.QuestionsIf you want an opinion about a specific stock or sector, even   those we did not mention, just ask! Put questions in the   comments. Address them to a specific expert if you wish. Each has   a specialty. Who is your favorite? (You can choose me, although   my feelings will not be hurt very much if you prefer one of the   models).ConclusionThe current trading environment is treacherous. Many frustrated traders are bailing out. Or have blown out. Political opinions about policy have proved to be a dangerous foundation for trading and investing.Our models provide a range of diverse ideas, all successful. Pick one that you like. Use it as a counterpoint for your own method. And keep control of position size and risk.The Stock Exchange does not have all the answers, but it     provides good ideas and a stimulus for your own trading.See alsoING: The Fundamentals Justify The Stock Price Momentumon seekingalpha.com"

4 Stocks That Are NOT Driven by the Trump Trade;2/3/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAnyone who has been watching the markets for the past two months knows the far-reaching impact President Trump has had on stocks, bonds and currencies. Stock indices soared to all-time highs, bond prices dropped to 52-week lows and the value of the U.S. dollar climbed to highs last seen during the financial crisis.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockIf it seems like all sectors of the market were touched by the election, they were. President Trump's campaign promises, if enacted, have the ability to reach every corner of the stock market.His promised changes to the business tax code would impact every business. His promised changes to the personal income tax code would impact nearly every consumer. His promised infrastructure spending would increase inflation for the entire nation. His promised changes to the Affordable Care Act (ACA) would impact nearly every employee. His promised relaxing of government regulations would affect nearly every employer. The list goes on and on.Looking at the market through this lens, there is not a company or stock that will not be impacted in some way by the Trump presidency. However, not all companies will be impacted to the same extent. Some companies are more vulnerable - for good or bad - to the promised policy changes than others.For instance, large banks and other financial institutions - likeGoldman Sachs Group Inc(NYSE:GS) - have been the unrivaled beneficiaries of a Trump presidency up to this point, because so many of the president's suggested changes benefit the banks' bottom lines. Rising inflation, lower corporate taxes and decreased regulation all benefit the banks.The Top 10 Dow Dividend Stocks for FebruaryConversely, biotech companies - likeBiogen Inc(NASDAQ:BIIB) - have struggled in the aftermath of the presidential election because the uncertainty swirling around what will eventually replace the ACA after the Republican-controlled Congress repeals it, coupled with the pointedTwitter Inc(NYSE:TWTR) and interview criticisms President Trump has issued regarding the high price of pharmaceuticals and other medical treatments, has created a tremendous amount of uncertainty in the healthcare industry.So which companies are less vulnerable to the potential policy changes and political whims of the president?While it's important to note that no company is immune from the potential threat of a targeted Twitter tirade from the president should it happen to draw his ire, there does seem to be a group of stocks that could bullishly go on its merry way during the first half of 2017 without having to look over its shoulder every morning to see if some new policy decision may threaten to derail its progress: the ""FANG"" stocks.The FANG stocks -Facebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB),Amazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN),Netflix(NASDAQ:NFLX) andAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) [formerly Google, hence the ""G""]  - have been Wall Street darlings for the past few years. The shift consumers have made to living in an online world for everything from their social networking to shopping has pushed the valuation of these companies ever higher as traders bet on this trend continuing, regardless of what else happens in the economy.The FANG stocks took an initial hit after the results of the presidential election were announced in early November, as traders started taking profits on some of their more lucrative positions and rotating that money into the financial sector and other sectors that were poised to rally following President Trump's win. Nobody was doubting the strength of the FANG stocks - they just needed to free up cash to invest in even hotter stocks at the time.Once the initial rotation was complete, investors started coming back to the FANG stocks, which were then trading at much more favorable valuations, and started buying them up. After all, whatever happens to inflation, whatever happens with the tax code, whatever happens with health care, consumers are going to continue connecting with friends on Facebook, buying more stuff on Amazon, watching videos on Netflix and searching for information on Google.Why Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock Should Expect Fireworks SoonWe expect the FANG stocks and other tech stocks like them - stocks likeApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) andNvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA) - to continue to do well during the next few months. We will certainly have to keep watching what the Trump administration does in the future (watching the net neutrality debate is going to be especially important for NFLX), but the traders on Wall Street aren't going to abandon their perpetual winners just yet.InvestorPlace advisors John Jagerson and S.

More iPhones, Less Profit;2/2/2017;"After three quarters of declining revenue and iPhone sales,Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) managed to return to growth during its first   fiscal quarter. Not only that, Apple put up some record numbers.   Revenue was $78.35 billion, up 3.3 % year over year and a new   quarterly record. EPS grew 2.4% to $3.36, also a new quarterly   record.iPhone unit sales surged 5% to 78.3 million, the most ever in   a single quarter. The company also set all-time revenue records   for services, Mac, and Apple Watch. There was a lot to like.Apple stocksurged the following day, with investors relieved that fears of a   continued slide in sales were overblown.While Apple put together a fine quarter, the company's results   aren't quite as good as they seem.makeArticleAd();Image source: Apple.A profit declineApple managed to grow its per-share earnings during the first   quarter, but a quick look at the income statement reveals a   different story. Apple increased its revenue by $2.48 billion   compared to the first quarter of last year, but cost of sales,   the cost of producing its products, surged $2.73 billion. Gross   profit declined by a little less than 1% as a result.So Apple sold more devices, but it accepted a lower gross   margin, and none of that extra revenue flowed through to the   bottom line. This gross profit decline and a 9% increase in   operating expenses led operating income to drop 3.4%. Net income   slumped by a smaller 1.6% thanks to an increase in other income,   which includes income for interest and dividends, among other   items.Apple was able to grow its EPS because of its expansive share   buyback program. The company's diluted share count declined by   4.8% year over year, fueled by billions of dollars of share   buybacks. Apple spent $10.9 billion on share buybacks during the   first quarter alone, an 57% increase compared to the prior-year   period.To be fair, Apple still generated $17.9 billion of net income   during the quarter, a staggering sum. But the fact that profit   and revenue are moving in opposite directions should be a concern   for investors. There's nothing wrong with share buybacks,   especially when cash continues to pile up. But they're the only   reason Apple was able to set an EPS record.An extra weekDid you know that Apple's first quarter this year had 14   weeks, compared to 13 weeks in the first quarter last year? If   you only read Apple's press release, this fact may come as a   surprise. Amongst all the talk of records, there's no mention of   the extra week. You would have had to delve into the 10-Q or   listen to the conference call in order to find recognition of   this substantial tailwind.If you just take the numbers and adjust them for this extra   week, the quarter doesn't look so good. Revenue would have   slumped 4.1%, iPhone unit sales would have declined 2.8%, and   operating income would have tumbled 10.3%. This is a simplistic   way to adjust for the extra week, as sales weren't spread out   uniformly throughout the quarter. But it gives a sense of how   significant an extra week can be.During the conference call, CFO Luca Maestri pointed to four   factors that offset this extra week. Slower growth of China   inventory, an earlier launch of the iPhone 7 compared to the   iPhone 6s in the previous year, a stronger U.S. dollar, and a   patent infringement payment in the first quarter of last year all   hurt the company's results relative to the prior-year period.Maestri doesn't say by what degree these factors offset the   extra week, and in the absence of an extra week, they would have   read like a list of excuses. Adjusted for that extra week,   Apple's first quarter wasn't as solid as the headline numbers   suggest. It almost certainly wasn't as bad as my simplistic   calculation above, but it puts an asterisk next to Apple's   numbers.The good news for Apple investors is that the company's   guidance for the second quarter was positive. Apple expects to   produce between $51.5 billion and $53.5 billion of revenue, up   from $50.6 billion during the second quarter of last year. Gross   margin is expected to decline, which will again pressure Apple's   bottom line. But the major sales declines of the past few   quarters appear to be in the rearview mirror -- at least for   now.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Buy Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock on This Q4 Earnings Dip;2/2/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsA few years ago, analysts had to add numbers from dozens of retail companies to see how Christmas went. Now they just wait on the earnings fromAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN), which came out after the market closed on Feb. 2. Unfortunately, Christmas wasn't as rosy as hoped, and AMZN stock is down about 4% in Thursday's after-market trade as a result.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockAmazon's final numbers were somewhat mixed. AMZN beat estimates on the earnings front, bringing in $1.54 per share - better than the consensus mark of $1.40, and the company's seventh straight quarter of profit.But Amazon was light on revenues, at $43.74 billion versus expectations of $44.84 billion. That still was a big jump from the $35.75 billion in revs last year, but not enough to please investors or experts. That caused AMZN stock to drop 4% within minutes.Bad news for most, though some - includingBlue Chip Growtheditor Louis Navellier - were hoping to buy Amazon stock on the dip.CEO Jeff Bezos emphasized the variety of Amazon Prime servicesin his release, mentioning new offerings in gaming, storage, music and its Prime Now same-day shopping services. The company's studio launched hit shows likeThe Grand TourandMan in the High Castle, while the movieManchester by the Seadrew Oscar nominations but will debut on Prime within a few months.5 Stocks to Buy to Defy a Weak FebruaryOur James Brumley was expecting fireworks after earnings, but most options traders were not making big bets either way. Most recently,I took some money off the table on Amazon, which as I noted was becoming a huge piece of my retirement savings.The biggest news from the analyst community was a super-bull call from Bill Miller, chairman of LMM Investments, claiming the value of AMZN stockcould double again in three years- making it more valuable thanApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL). He also stating that Amazon now has higher gross margins thanWal-Mart Stores Inc.(NYSE:WMT), which regularly sells nearly $120 billion of merchandise each quarter - not just at Christmas.The big turn in Amazon stock started when the company started breaking out numbers from Amazon Web Services, its cloud services unit,after the first quarter of 2015. Since then, the company has more than doubled, as the unit has been growing at 50% per year and proving it can book one-fourth of that revenue as operating profit, even when accounting for stock options given its top employees.In the third quarter, for instance, AWS earned $861 million on revenues of $3.231 billion. Yes, that's more thanthe whole company earned. Amazon still loses money regularly on its international expansion, where it now brings in nearly one-third of its revenue. For the fourth quarter, AWS brought in revenue of $3.54 billion, which was seen as disappointing.Why Buy AMZN Stock Now?It's the expectation of huge growth on a massive scale that have made Amazon the fourth-largest company by market capitalization in the U.S. It recently passedBerkshire Hathaway Inc.(NYSE:BRK.B), whose revenues regularly run 50% better than Amazon's Christmas expectations.Shares dropped 5.1% the day after the third quarter missed expectations oOct. 27, and you could have gotten Amazon for $719 per share two weeks later, on Nov. 14. But since then the stock has been on fire, and closed before earnings near $840 per share.Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA) Stock Has a Secret WeaponBuyers keep coming for Amazon because every quarter, it seems to do something spectacular.This quarter, for instance, it delivered a new credit card offering 5% all Amazon purchases to Prime members. It announced a new air hub near Cincinnati,sinking sharesofUnited Parcel Service, Inc.(NYSE:UPS) andFedEx Corporation(NYSE:FDX). Its Alexa personal assistant dominated the Consumer Electronics Show,as our Brad Moon reported.All this has made AMZN stock a must-have for a growing number of small investors, who race in whenever the stock stumbles.Just like it did this afternoon.Dana Blankenhornis a financial and technology journalist.

Apple's Biggest Growth Engine (Services) Coming of Age;2/2/2017;"While iPhones returning to growth is good news of course, it's evident that the business has lost momentum. Penetration levels have increased significantly with the scope for further innovation shrinking with each new product generation. So users not just in traditional markets but also in some emerging markets have less of a reason to upgrade.Since AppleAAPLsells a high-end product, its market is further limited. So a jump in the holiday sales doesn't excite me as much as the fact that the number of iPhone users increased double-digits during the quarter. Because it is the installed base of over a billion active devices that Apple can count on to use its services and generate recurring revenue for the company.What Services Did This QuarterApple's service revenue grew 13.4% sequentially and 18.4% year over year to around $7.2 billion. Management said that growth would have been higher taking out the one-time receipt of $548 million in the year-ago quarter and adjusting for the extra week of sales in December. This is the fourth straight quarter that services grew strong double-digits and contributed an equal or greater share of revenue than both Macs and iPads, making it the second most significant segment behind iPhones.At just 9% of revenue, Apple however has no legal compulsion to provide too much detail on what this business is about. It does offer interesting tidbits though such as the paid subscriptions number that was over 150 million in the last quarter.Consequently, services include a motley crowd, the chief of which is the App Store. This business ""broke all-time records during the holiday quarter, including $3 billion in purchases in December alone, making it the App Store's single best month ever,"" in the words of CEO Tim Cook. Over 2.2 million developers are currently working on apps for the App Store and payments to developers have now topped $60 billion.So it isn't surprising that both the average revenue per customer account and the number of customer accounts grew strongly. Apple also quoted App Annie as saying that App Store revenue more than doubled Google Play revenue in calendar 2016. Another positive about this business is that it isn't geographically limited, meaning that even a soft market like China is currently contributing to sales.Apple Music grew for the third straight quarter as Apple enabled downloads in addition to the streaming business. It has had good luck with exclusive content to date and is currently looking at original content to further push things.Apple Pay users tripled, transaction volumes jumped 500% running into the billions of dollars as the service expanded to Japan, Russia, New Zealand and Spain. Nearly 2 million small businesses are accepting payments through Apple Pay.AppleCare is closely linked to the growth in the installed base, so it continues to grow strongly.iCloud storage services are doing well, and that's all that Apple will say about it.Why's This So Important?It's hard to overstate the importance of this segment as mobile computing devices race to their saturation point. Device sales overall are coming down and what little growth is there today will be gone tomorrow. Upgrades will be fewer and sales will depend on the ability to take market share.The other reason is profitability. Management says very little about the margin profile and makes sure we understand that there are many parts to this business that don't generate the same margins. But they also say that the segment carries higher margins than the rest of the business.This makes perfect sense since hardware generally carries lower margins than software that is increasingly offered as a service these days. So as the mix of this business grows, it will fetch stronger margins for Apple.Also, while Apple has successfully convinced customers its devices are worth the money, hardware innovation hasn't been that great in recent times and could get more difficult going forward. So differentiation could be rooted in the software ecosystem more than it has been thus far.Apple shares currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

What's Next for iPhones After Strong Holiday Quarter?;2/2/2017;"AppleAAPLshares jumped over 6% yesterday after the company returned to growth in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. A lot of the optimism was on account of iPhone sales, which grew 4.7% from last year to the highest ever tally of 78.3 million units or around two-thirds of total sales. Street estimates varied between 77-78 million units.Apple Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseApple Inc. Price and EPS Surprise|Apple Inc. Quote""iPhone's Best Performance for Over a Year""Neil Mawston, Executive Director at Strategy Analytics, said in a statement that this was the iPhone's best performance in over a year, putting it back on top as the world's largest smartphone vendor. But he also said that the numbers were helped by the Samsung Note 7 fiasco. As a result, Samsung didn't see as much of the fourth-quarter bump-up as it usually does (it still managed a 29% share in the U.S. compared to Apple's 31%, according to Kantar Worldpanel).Apple's growth rate was also slightly lower than in the year-ago quarter, and was likely impacted by the stronger dollar and by stiff competition from local players in China like Huawei, ZTE, Lenovo, OPPO and Vivo that may have led to a loss in market share. Revenues from China were down 12% in the last quarter. Tim Cook used an optimistic tone: ""I'm encouraged with the significant improvement but we're not without challenges there.""He also said that sales would have been stronger if demand for the more expensive iPhone 7 Plus hadn't been underestimated. As it turned out, the more expensive device was more popular based on new features like better cameras and more RAM, which therefore led to a supply shortage. If it wasn't such a competitive market, this may not have been such a bad problem to have.However, it does reverse an earlier trend that saw the iPhone 6S Plus and iPhone 6 Plus growing slower than their less expensive partners. It also seems to indicate that customers are unwilling to upgrade without meaningful new features, but will pay more for them when they're there.As a result, the two new models that also came with water resistance while ditching the headphone socket accounted for 17% of iPhone sales, according to research firm Localytics, as reported in the media. This also raised the average selling price to $695 from $691 in the year-ago quarter.The Good and Bad Going ForwardSmartphone sales growth rates are not going to come back to where they've been the last few years. For example, consider that the iPhone 6 launch in Sep 2014 was followed by a 46% increase in shipments the following quarter. This kind of growth is history, because penetration continues to increase across the world.Second, Apple's growth rates have also been fueled by market share gains in China, which may not be repeated for a number of reasons including greater penetration, the stronger dollar, a more difficult operating environment, the increasingly strained relations between China and the U.S. and the abundant supply of local makes of varying price tags.Third, Apple is likely to maintain or even grow share in developed markets and markets with higher penetration on the strength of its brand. But these upgrades will be dependent on innovation. Tim Cook says: ""The smartphone is still in the early innings of the game,"" and ""I think there's lots more to do... We've got some exciting things in the pipeline. I still feel really, really good about it."" But if the upgrades over the past two years are anything to go by, it seems that there's a limit to that innovation.That of course brings us to the question of the upcoming iPhone 8 that is expected to have an all-new design, glass casing and other exciting features. Plus, it's the iPhone's 10thanniversary, so there's some pent-up excitement there. If Apple delivers in line with the hype, it should have blockbuster sales. Beginning in the September quarter when it will launch that is and provided Apple doesn't under-supply the things. Until then, we should expect customers to hold off purchases (more so than in earlier years because the excitement for the new phone is more this time).The other somewhat positive factor is India where Apple's talks with government officials appear to be going well. India is a faster-growing market than China at the moment because of relatively lower penetration, a rising middle class and the Prime Minister's stated goal of digitizing the nation. Once Apple starts building its stores in the region, its brand value is bound to appreciate and translate into increased sales for the company. But it's not a done deal yet, especially considering the concessions Apple is asking for, so some uncertainty persists.Apple shares currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The tech-laden index continues to be the best looking of the bunch, and its dominance has only increased during earnings season. Solid performance fromApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) toMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) following their respective earnings releases has helped keep the good times rolling. But do you know which heavy hitter may be sporting the best opportunity right now?International Business Machines Corp.(NYSE:IBM).makeArticleAd();Source:Open Grid Scheduler Via FlickrLet's take a deep dive into the chart of IBM stock to see what kind of trade we can drum up.Like the lion's share of the equities market, IBM jumped into an uptrend following last year's election and it hasn't looked back since. The tech titan entered the new year with a solid high base pattern that created a breakout opportunity for technical traders.And they didn't have to wait long. Big Blue's earnings beat from Jan. 19 served as the excuse for buyers to come rushing in.The action in IBM stock since then has been textbook. After breaching the $170 resistance level, the stock gained a quick ten bucks before the bulls' fury finally faded.5 Safe Dividend Stocks to Buy for RetirementSince then, mild profit-taking has created an attractive four-day pullback. Traders loath to chase now have their opportunity to scoop up shares at a discount.Source: OptionsAnalytixRecent volume patterns have also been favoring buyers. The post-earnings breakout was accompanied by a handful of accumulation days suggesting institutions were entering the fray with aggression. And while the stock has retreated in recent days, the volume has been muted suggesting a lack of any real conviction by sellers here.Throw it all together, and this IBM stock dip looks like a buy.IBM Stock Calendars, Anyone?With earnings fading in the distance, IBM options have become cheap again. And that means long option trades carry much less risk. Let's build a calendar spread to capitalize on further upside in the stock over the coming month.First, buy to open the Apr $170 call for around $7.60. Then, sell to open the Mar $180 call for around $1.25. This creates a diagonal call spread for a net debit of $6.35. The max loss is limited to the initial debit and will be forfeited if IBM sits below $170 at Apr expiration.Why Sony Corp (ADR) (SNE) Stock Should Ditch the Entertainment BizTo minimize the loss, I suggest exiting if the stock breaks the $165 support level.The max profit is around $400 and will be captured if IBM sits right at $180 at March expiration.

Why Sony Corp (ADR) (SNE) Stock Should Ditch the Entertainment Biz;2/2/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSony Corp (ADR)(NYSE:SNE) saw some great movement back in 2013 when activist investor Dan Loeb delivered ahand-written letterto CEO Kazuo Hirai. In that letter, Loeb, petitioned for Sony to spin off its entertainment division, which includes movies, television and music. Loeb believed the move would increase the value of Sony stock and reward shareholders … and another weak quarter for the division makes that memory all the more painful.makeArticleAd();Source:WikipediaLoeb has since sold his stake, after being the largest shareholder with 6% of shares, but new rumors see Sony selling off part of the unit. SNE stock is ready to roll in 2017 if this move finally comes into play.TheNew York Postreports that Sony is listening to pitches from interested parties in the Sony Entertainment division. Rumors seeCBS Corporation(NYSE:CBS), a Chinese media company, or a technology company likeApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) orFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) acquiring this asset from Sony.An outright sale of the division that includes movies and television would differ from Loeb's original plan, which called for the entertainment unit going public and including Sony Music.On Thursday, Sony reported a weak fiscal third quarter due to the movies division. SNE lost $913 million in the pictures division - thanks to a $962 million write-down - bringing Q3 profits down to $169 million. Even without the one time event, the division was very weak compared to last year's third quarter, which thrived thanks to the James Bond installmentSpectre.Why a Sony Entertainment Sale Could Still WorkThose results aside, though, the Sony Entertainment division is incredibly valuable in today's content monetization world. The company creates movies and television series - and naturally could produce more - that would fit well for many acquiring companies. Within Sony, this division often is buried under a focus on video games, televisions, and smartphone technology.5 Stocks to Buy to Defy a Weak FebruarySNE has struggled to produce high box-office gross from its movie division, but that could change with its 2017 lineup. This year, the studio will release sequels to movies likeTrainspottingandSmurfs. The studio will also release a remake ofJumanji, with a prominent Dec. 22 opening date. Along with theSmurfs: The Lost Village, Sony is betting on its animated offerings with other titlesThe Emoji MovieandThe Staralso coming in 2017.While some reports say Sony is waiting to sell the division until it sees how strong the opening ofThe Emoji Movieis, I have to believe that they are waiting for another small movie coming out on July 7. You might have heard of it. It's calledSpider-Man: Homecoming. Sony has had better luck in terms of overall box office revenue and market share in years when a Spider-Man movie has been released.This could be the perfect time to monetize the entertainment division for the company and reward owners of SNE stock.In2016, Sony held only an 8.3% market share of the U.S. box office with $943.5 million grossed from 36 movies. This was the highest number of movies released among the main studios. Sony ranked well behindWalt Disney Co(NYSE:DIS),Time Warner Inc.(NYSE:TWX),NBC/UniversalandNews Corp's(NASDAQ:NWSA) Fox, who all grossed more than $1.5 billion domestically during the year. Only two Sony movies (GhostbustersandAngry Birds) grossed more than $100 million domestically.This has been a common theme, and also one of the reasons why the entertainment division is so unpredictable for a large technology company like Sony. In 2015, the studio barely cleared $1 billion thanks to two decent-performing movies inSpectreandHotel Transylvania2.A Big Lineup AheadAs mentioned above, releasing a Spider-Man movie has been a good thing for SNE and could lift Sony stock soon.Back in 2014, Sony finished fourth with a market share of 12% and $1.3 billion domestically.The Amazing Spider-Man 2grossed $202.9 million domestically and another $506.1 million internationally. In 2012, Sony ranked second at the box office with a 16.5% market share and $1.8 billion in domestic box office revenue.SkyfallandThe Amazing Spider-Manled the way with $291 million and $262 million, respectively.The Amazing Spider-Mangrossed an additional $496 million in international markets.Along with a strong 2017 planned, Sony's movie division is also releasing additional Spider-Man movies,Bad Boys 3,Bad Boys 4,Hotel Transylvania 3,Goosebumps 2,Barbieand more animated movies. Other intellectual properties owned include Charlie's Angels, 21 Jump Street, Ghostbusters, The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo and Men in Black.Make Bank of America Corp (BAC) Stock a Great Trade AgainThe time for SNE to sell this asset could absolutely be now as it has a decent pipeline, can capitalize on the Spider-Man results, and may full well know the best is behind it. The company lost the rights to the James Bond movies and has only released two of its top 10 grossing movies since 2010 (SkyfallandThe Amazing Spider-Man).Sony Entertainment has more to offer a new owner than just movies. The division also produces and distributes television shows, and has a handful of media networks, with a strong presence internationally. The division's global footprint covers 178 countries and more than 1.4 billion subscribers.Hit television shows under the Sony umbrella includeBetterCall Saul,Jeopardy,BlackishandShark Tank. The television division has really grown, and could be the biggest reason this asset is undervalued, and sets up a big win for Sony stock. In the 2015-16 season, Sony had 33 series on the air. That is a sharp increase from the 15 a decade ago in 2005-06.Bottom Line for Sony StockAdd it all up and you have a top five movie studio, an increasing producer of original content for numerous channels, owner of strong intellectual property and syndicated programs, and an international television channel owner. Those assets will make Sony's Entertainment arm incredibly valuable to CBS, a Chinese media company or whoever is currently sniffing around.Sony may be hesitant to let go of the entertainment arm that has helped to make up for weakness in the electronics markets in years past. Thursday's Q3, however, showed just how much trouble the movie business is in.The company should capitalize on its upcoming slate and reward Sony stock holders shareholders with a sale of the division.As of this writing, Chris Katje did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceThe 5 Best Stocks to Buy for Big Emerging Markets ProfitsThe 10 Best Stocks to Buy for 2017: The Experts' PicksThe Top 10 Dow Dividend Stocks for FebruaryThe postWhy Sony Corp (ADR) (SNE) Stock Should Ditch the Entertainment Bizappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Google Earnings: The Market Has Made The Same Mistake Twice;2/2/2017;"Google Earnings (Shutterstock photo)As a general rule, the market is pretty good about learning from its mistakes. After all, there is nothing like a hefty loss to teach traders what not to do.That is a simple fact that must be borne in mind when looking for patterns in pricing; if the pattern involves a reaction to news that was ultimately proven wrong, it is unlikely to repeat very often, and the few opportunities when it does should be grabbed with both hands.makeArticleAd();That is what makes Google parent company Alphabet (GOOG:GOOGL) look like such a good buy after its reaction to Q4 earnings.As you can see from the chart below, prior to last week’s earnings report Google (I’m sorry but I just can’t bring myself to call the company “Alphabet”) had dropped sharply on earnings misses contained in two of the previous three releases, in April and October.On both of those occasions, though, the big drop in price was, with the benefit of 20/20 hindsight, an opportunity to buy the stock at a discount. There are different circumstances this time around, of course, but the dynamic that has made negative reactions to earnings in the past opportunities is still in place, so the end result is likely to be the same.The biggest problems with the Q4 results as far as traders were concerned, it seems, were that cost per click was down, and operating costs had risen to the point where earnings per Class A share (EPS) of $9.36 fell short of the Street’s estimates of around $9.64. Still, revenues of $26.06 billion beat the estimated $25.26 billion.There was also a concern lurking in the background regarding Google taking on both Amazon (AMZN)’s Echo and Apple (AAPL)’s iPhone with recent hardware launches. Google said that they were pleased with the reaction to both Google Home and the Pixel phone without going into specifics, but doubts about the wisdom of the strategy persist.I actually believe that Google has a chance of limited success in each case. The Pixel will be the most uphill struggle as the iPhone’s dominance of the mobile phone market is well established. Most estimates of sales of the phone so far are around 1 million, which hardly puts a dent in the iPhone, but may prove to be enough of a base to make the Pixel profitable as a niche product.Home has an easier, more logical path to success as Google is the natural choice of those looking for what is, essentially, a free-standing search engine.Ultimately, though, neither Home nor Pixel is going to be the driver of the recovery in the stock price that history suggests will come soon.First, the increase in operating costs that Google reported seems, on a breakdown of the numbers, to be the result of investment in the core business. Losses in what the company calls “Other Bets,” things like “Nest” and self driving cars, were actually reduced somewhat in the fourth quarter, but there was significant progress on the autonomous vehicle front.The possibilities of that field are endless and Google, along with Tesla (TSLA) and Apple, are generally seen as the leaders in driverless car research and technology.The other issue, of falling cost per click (CPC), is also not what it seems on the surface. It reflects a continuing move to mobile that results in that metric falling, but the volume of clicks increasing. The same issue was, in part, responsible for the April and October drops in GOOG after earnings, and the chart tells the story of how long it was until investors realized that volume more than offset falling CPC.Looking at Google’s results and the market reaction to them, I get a sense of déjà vu. We have actually been here before, twice, and each time the drop in GOOG gave investors a chance to buy cheaply. It seems that in this case the market is still learning from its mistake and over time the outcome here is most likely to be the same."

Make Bank of America Corp (BAC) Stock a Great Trade Again;2/2/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAyuuugenarrative inBank of America Corp(NYSE:BAC) and other financials has lost a bit of steam in recent days. Nevertheless and as you'll soon see, that's a very good thing for shares … and even better if you're willing to trade BAC stock.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');Source:Mike Mozart via FlickrToday, I have an idea for some financial engineering that won't break the bank.Following a massive rally spurred by President Trump-inspired idealism on everything from deregulation to a corporate tax boon to beneficial re-inflation conditions, BAC stock has gone nowhereveryfast over the past few weeks.Investors are now busy backtracking on a bit of the market's notorious perfect pricing mechanism. That has put a lid on BofA. A newer, bearish narrative of protectionist policies and potential trade wars have been stealing the spotlight in recent days since the new administration took the reins.At the end of the day, market narratives happen all the time. It's the gray in-between area where history is eventually written.5 Stocks to Buy to Defy a Weak FebruaryMaybe Goldman Sachs knows what tomorrow, next week or the next four years look like, but it's good to have an investment backstop - like options on BAC stock - rather than rely too aggressively on the""Trump put.""BAC Stock ChartClick to EnlargeBank of America hasremoved the downside risksassociated with an extremely overbought condition. What's more, the price action also indicates a breakout and rally are imminent.Admittedly, our prior technical case of BAC - prone to a corrective move into the $20-$21 area - proved too ambitious with a low of $21.77 for the period. But as both price and time are important factors in determining a correction; some good work has been provided in Bank of America.Subsequent price movement in BAC stock has consolidated brisk gains of around 35% to establish a neutral, but constructive seven- to eight-week flat base pattern. So while the depth of BofA's correction came up short of our forecast, the duration spent and firmness of the bid suggests the upside outweighs the downside risks at this juncture.Now, for the trade.How to Trade BAC Stock HereGiven the continued supportive dynamics working hard to make BofA great again, and the removal of earnings risk, I like a modified collar combination right now.Sell an Apr $25 call and buy the Apr $22/$20 bear put spread for $23.10, as of BAC's current price of $23.02. A bullish investor maintains about 8.5% of upside into April expiration with the sold $25 call capping profits at $1.90 per spread.The max gain on BAC is unadjusted and on an expiration basis, with the potential for larger gains by rolling the position beyond the initial hedge.Why Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock Will NEVER Be About P/EOn the flipside, if BAC stock fails to move higher and declines in price, the bear put spread portion of the combo affords the trader a partial but very effective hedge from $20-$22.Under ideal conditions, the spread works to buffer the loss in share price, dollar-for-dollar. But even during a less agreeable price swing lower, this modified collar should greatly curtail downside risk on BAC stock - and in our view trumps other alternatives quite nicely.Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in any of the securities or their derivatives mentioned in this article.

The site raked in $8.83 billion, higher than the $8.52 billion that analysts expected. Earnings came in at a stellar $1.41 per share, which was well ahead of the $1.31 per share that analysts polled byThomson Reuterswere calling for over the three months.5 Stocks to Buy to Defy a Weak FebruaryOne of the most important milestones that Facebook reached to end the year came in the form of its active monthly users around the globe, which rose to 1.86 billion. The figure was slightly ahead of the 1.84 billion that was projected. Active daily users amounted to 1.23 billion by the end of the month, about 40 million higher than estimates.FB grew 0.7% after hours Wednesday, but Facebook stock is down 1.2% today.Metlife Inc (MET)Metlife's quarterly figuresmissed the markWednesday afternoon.

Operating profit for the period came in at $1.42 billion, which was $40 million higher than what Metlife posted the prior year in the same quarter. Overall, the company posted a net loss of $2.09 billion.The disappointing results can be partially attributed to the company's decision to increase interest rates, which reduced the carrying value of its derivatives book.

Operating earnings in Europe and Asia were also strong, wafting up 33.3% and 22%, respectively.MET stock fell 1.6% after the bell yesterday, and is down 5.2% in early morning trading.Symantec Corporation (SYMC)Symantec Operation had mixed results for itsfiscal third quarterof 2016.Earnings minus items came in at 32 cents per share, rising 23% compared to the third quarter of 2015.

Meanwhile, revenue will be similar at around $1.08 billion.SYMC shares dipped 0.1% after Tuesday's market close, and is currently down 1.1% Thursday.

Thursday’s Vital Data: Apple Inc. (AAPL), Facebook Inc (FB) and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD);2/2/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe bloom is off the rose for the ""Trump rally,"" and Wall Street is finally taking the new administration at its word as U.S. stock futures are headed broadly lower this morning. A string of geopolitical issues from President Donald Trump has traders worried, including potentialnew sanctions on Iran, the threat ofsending troops to Mexicoand a heated exchange with the Australian prime minister.makeArticleAd();As a result, futures on theDow Jones Industrial Averageare down 0.23%,S&P 500futures are off 0.22% andNasdaq-100futures have fallen 0.23%.On the options front, call activity rebounded amid a string of strong quarterly reports from the tech sector. Overall, about 16.5 million calls and 14.2 million puts crossed the tape yesterday. On the CBOE, however, put activity remained a potent driver, with the single-session equity put/call volume ratio arriving at 0.71 and the 10-day moving average hitting another three-month high of 0.69.As for Wednesday's volume leaders,Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) call options chased yesterday's post-earnings rally as the company offered up a much-needed win. Elsewhere,Facebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) also drew heavy call volume ahead of last night's quarterly report andAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMD) extended its blistering 12-month rally to more than 430% on the heels of another blowout quarter.Apple Inc. (AAPL)After posting three straight quarters of declining revenue and faltering earnings, Apple finally hit it big. For the holiday quarter, Apple said it earned $3.36 per share on revenue of $78.4 billion, easily besting expectations for $3.22 per share on revenue of $77.42 billion.5 Stocks to Buy to Defy a Weak FebruaryAccording to CEO Tim Cook, the results were ""Apple's highest quarterly revenue ever and broke multiple records along the way. We sold more iPhones than ever before and set all-time revenue records for iPhone, Services, Mac and Apple Watch.""But while AAPL options traders attempted to chase the rally with calls, Wednesday's post-earnings call volume (as a percentage of total volume) still came in light. Total volume reached a whopping 3.34 million contracts yesterday, with calls accounting for a below average 61% of the day's take. Still, 3.34 million contracts is quite impressive, and adds up to quite a lot of call activity on AAPL stock.On the other hand, some traders appear to be fading the rally already, as open interest at the 3 Feb $128 and $127 strikes surged to more than 10,000 contracts each. AAPL is trading slightly lower in premarket action this morning, and broad market headwinds could place these puts in the money by weeks end.Facebook Inc (FB)Facebook stepped into the earnings limelight after the close last night to post itsseventh-straight earnings beat. The company said sales surged 53% to $8.83 billion, with earnings arriving at $1.41 per share. Wall Street was expecting earnings of $1.31 per share on revenue of $8.52 billion. Additionally, daily active users (DAUs) rose 18% to 1.23 billion, mobile DAUs were up 23% at 1.15 billion and mobile ad revenue came in at 84% of all advertising revenue.FB stock options traders were quite bullish heading into the report, with calls accounting for 64% of the nearly 1.6 million contracts traded. FB is trading roughly 0.6% higher this morning, with the shares set to open in record high territory north of $135.Currently, there are 12,700 calls open at the $135 strike in the 3 Feb series, with another 12,000 at $137 and 12,700 at the $140 strike. If buying pressure can overcome broad market headwinds, FB could make a run at $137, but $140 may be unreachable until the end of next week.Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD)AMD solidified its position in the semiconductor hot seat yesterday when the company blew past Wall Street's fourth-quarter earnings expectations.For the quarter, AMD narrowed its loss to a penny per share on revenue of $1.11 billion, compared to expectations for a loss of two cents per share on $1.07 billion in sales.What's more, AMD said its Ryzen should hit shelves by March and that the much-anticipated graphics processor should boost revenue by 18%.Why Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock Will NEVER Be About P/EAMD options traders were all over call contracts yesterday, with these typically bullish best making up 66% of the 712,000 contracts traded - well above average for AMD. As of yesterday's close, the stock is trading north of all but the most bullish of heavy call OI strikes in the Feb. series, with 1,400 contracts at $12.50 and 1,100 at $13.However, there is a bit of profit taking going on this morning, with AMD pulling back by about 1.5% amid broad market selling pressure. Profit taking might not be a bad idea at the moment, as a consolidation period is warranted after yesterday's 16% surge.As of this writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceThe Top 10 Dow Dividend Stocks for FebruaryThe 5 Best Stocks to Buy for Big Emerging Markets ProfitsThe postThursday's Vital Data: Apple Inc.

Are Garmin Ltd. (GRMN) and Fitbit Inc (FIT) the Perfect Long/Short Play?;2/2/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsRecent statistics from the two wearable rivals suggest thatGarmin Ltd.(NASDAQ:GRMN) is winning the war againstFitbit Inc(NYSE:FIT), making a hypothetical long/short play between the two stocks a very interesting proposition.makeArticleAd();Source:Via FitbitHowever, thinking about buying Garmin and shorting Fitbit stock - and actually following through with it - are two entirely different beasts.I have never shorted a stock and likely never will; I'm just not built that way. Whenever I'm asked byInvestorPlace, or any of the other financial publications I write for, to do a ""sell"" piece on a stock or a group of stocks, I always have a tougher time coming up with recommendations.I like to write about stocks that I would consider owning; negative spin doesn't enter my psyche. I can do it, it's just harder.This brings me to GRMN stock and FIT stock, the crux of this story.Why Fitbit Inc (FIT) Stock Can't Fall Much Lower Than ThisIn Q3 2016, Garmin shipped 1.3 million wearable devices, a 12.2% year-over-year increase. That compares to an 11.0% YOY increase for Fitbit. In Q2 2016, Garmin shipped 1.6 million wearable devices, a 106.7% increase over the same quarter a year earlier, while Fitbit shipped 5.7 million wearable devices, a 28.7% increase over the same quarter a year earlier.So, in the nine months ended September 2016, Garmin shipped 3.8 million wearable devices, a 40.7% increase year over year. Meanwhile, Fitbit shipped 15.8 million wearable devices, a 21.5% increase year over year.Between Q1 2015 and Q3 2016, Garmin's market share dropped by 40 basis points to 5.7%. During the same 18-month period, Fitbit's market share dropped 980 basis points to 23.0%.Fitbit Stock Continues to DeclineSamsung Electronics(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) and the many others that compete for the 50% market share not held by Fitbit,Xiaomi, Garmin, andApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) stand to benefit the most.Garmin is a big company and wearables are but one of many revenue streams. A 40-basis-point decline isn't a big deal for a company that generated $2.2 billion in revenue in the first nine months of fiscal 2016, an increase of 5.8%. If not for its auto segment (its largest by revenue), which saw a 17% decline year over year to $656.0 million, 2016 has been a winner.Over at Fitbit, the top line has been outstanding, with revenue growing 39.3% through the first nine months of the year to $1.6 billion. However, it's the bottom line that gets a little wonky.In the quarter ended Oct. 1, 2016, Fitbit's operating profit declined 33.1% to $44.4 million; for the nine months ended October 1, 2016, operating income declined 69.3% to $72.9 million. R&D, sales and marketing, and G&A expenses all have seen huge increases in 2016 as Fitbit struggles to remain on top of a wearables market that's slowing faster than anyone expected.InvestorPlacecontributor Aaron Levitt recently discussed Fitbit stock in relation to aslowing wearables market; he was pretty blunt in his assessment of the job CEO James Park is doing guiding the company through a rough patch that's seen FIT stock decline by 65% over the past year.""Both eMarketer and IDC both cite smartwatches as the big reason for the declines,"" wrote Levitt. ""Consumers just can't see the need for them as they overlap on features already found in smartphones. And when adding their heftier price tags, smartwatches are a fading fad.""So, what does Fitbit do to counter the fact that wearables' 2016 growth will be less than half the 60% projection at the start of the year? It buys not one, but two companies that make smartwatches.Bottom Line on Fitbit and GarminIf Fitbit continues to waste money on bad acquisitions and wasteful overhead that doesn't move the needle, you can bet that Fitbit's comfy cash position - $672 million in cash and marketable securities as of Q3 - will be gone faster than you can shake a stick at.So, should you go long on Garmin? Absolutely. With$1.1 billionin cash and marketable securities, no debt, and an operating margin of almost 21%, GRMN stock is a long-term hold.3 Stocks to Buy for Better Deals Than the Great RecessionAs for shorting FIT stock, I'm of two minds on this.Yes, theshorts represent almost 36% of its floatand its margins are about one-third Garmin's, but with $3 in cash it's got to be attractive to somebody in the industry - maybe even Garmin. That should keep Fitbit stock from dropping much farther.So, I wouldn't recommend investors buy or short Fitbit stock. Neither proposition looks like it will be a winner any time soon.More From InvestorPlaceThe 5 Best Stocks to Buy for Big Emerging Markets ProfitsHere's How Apple Inc.

Why Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock Will NEVER Be About P/E;2/2/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOne of the biggest negatives surroundingAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) is the company's sky-high price-to-earnings ratio. According to Google Finance, AMZN stock currently trades at an eye-popping 191 times its trailing earnings of $4.36 per share.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockBut Amazon has at least given investors the courtesy of growing profits to try to somewhat justify the lofty valuation. That 191x is on trailing 12-month earnings of $4.36 per share. In fiscal 2015, AMZN earned $596 million, or $1.25 per share. In 2014, it lost $241 million, which translates into 52 cents per share.It's obvious Amazon stock investors care about growth, not valuation. AMZN's sky-high P/E has been in place for years, and will likely continue for some time.And that's actually OK. Here are two important reasons why:Amazon Revenue GrowthAmazon is still one of the best growth stories in today's market.When the company releases 2016's final numbers Thursday, Feb. 2, analysts expect Amazon to post revenue of $137 billion. That's an improvement of more than 25% versus 2015's top line - a difficult feat when you're talking about 12-digit sales. And Amazon's $107 billion in revenue last year was 20% better than 2014.5 Stocks to Buy to Defy a Weak FebruaryWe live in a world in whichS&P 500constituents are doing well if they're posting just single-digit increases on the top line. You can blame this at least partly on the strong U.S. dollar, which is weighing down American multinationals. But the fact remains that meaningful growth is a scarce quality in today's stock market - especially among blue-chip stocks.Thus, AMZN stock is an easy way for investors to get access to big growth with relatively little risk.And Amazon is hardly running out of fuel. The company has only begun to expand into grocery and apparel - two huge categories. Trillions of dollars are spent worldwide each year at physical stores. That's not to mention the other gains Amazon still could make via the smart home, Amazon Web Services cloud offerings and other newer initiatives.Analysts predict Amazon's revenue will increase another 22% in 2017, hitting $168 billion. So again - the growth story is still well intact.But it's not all about growth. Many AMZN stock bulls argue that we're just looking at earnings the wrong way.Amazon Earnings: Better Than They Seem?One thing that separates Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos from many other executives is his ability to look at the really,reallylong-term. He's also willing to spend billions of dollars on ideas, and is OK with hitting a few duds if it means spawning great new ideas.Remember the company's smartphone? The Amazon Music Importer? How about a website called Askville? I'm guessing you might remember the Fire smartphone, but not the other two. Amazon lost $170 million on its smartphone alone.This kind of risk taking is an inherent part of Amazon's culture. It's the line of thinking that prodded the company to introduce some of its biggest winners to date, like cloud services, Prime shipping and the Kindle.Thus, many investors look at AMZN stock in a different way. They look at the company's operating profit, then they add back its substantial research and development costs to get a ""truer"" sense of profitability.Admittedly, that changes the picture dramatically.Apple Inc. Bulls: Beware These Charts! (AAPL)In its most recent quarter, Amazon produced net income of $252 million, which across 485 million diluted shares became diluted earnings of 52 cents per share. At the time, AMZN was trading at $822 per share. If we annualize that profit (not a perfect measure, as quarterly earnings fluctuate - this is just for an example), we're looking at a P/E of 395.But Amazon also reported operating profits of $575 million, and spent $4.14 billion on R&D - a significant expense. Add those together, and you get $4.715 billion, or $9.72 per share. Annualize that, then divide the share price by that, and you get a P/E of about 21.Let's take the actual numbers. Amazon currently trades for 190 times trailing 12-month earnings, as we said above. However, over the past four quarters, Amazon spent $15.11 billion on R&D and posted operating profits of more than $4 billion. That comes to $40.19 per share combined, and puts AMZN stock at a P/E of just more than 20.That's a lot of creative accounting, so take that with a spoonful of salt. But it's an interesting argument.Bottom Line on AMZN StockAmazon continues to be one of the best growth stories in today's market. As long as that continues, investors aren't going to care about the headline P/E ratio. It just doesn't matter. AMZN stock has doubled several times over despite it.Amazon is solidly profitable, even if the bottom line isn't as large as investors typically would like. But those earnings are being reinvested back in the business - which is what a high-growth company like Amazon should be doing anyway.As of this writing, Nelson Smith did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceWhy Amazon.com, Inc.

Apple Inc. Bulls: Beware These Charts! (AAPL);2/2/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsShares ofApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) rallied a strong 6% on Wednesday following the company's latest earnings report. While the rally was impressive, AAPL stock is now bumping into some critical technical resistance that bulls and bears alike should be aware of.makeArticleAd();Simply put, Apple's near- to possibly medium-term upside is limited at best.Apple's revenues in the latest quarter came in at a record $78.4 billion, which in part was helped by strong holiday demand for the new iPhone 7 series. These numbers are impressive, and I continue to be a longer-term believer in the company - particularly around the potential of AAPL being able to monetize deeper on the devices ecosystem through more services.When Ilast discussed shares of Appleon Dec. 28, 2016, I offered that if AAPL stock could clear above the $118 price level, then a next upside target around $123 would come into sight. Apple met and surpassed this target on Wednesday following the earnings announcement.From that perspective, Apple shares have now reached an important upside price target.AAPL Stock ChartsLet's take a step back and look at the multiyear weekly chart of AAPL stock. We see that despite the big swing lower from the 2015 highs into the mid-2016 lows, and most recently back up toward the 2015 highs, Apple has, largely speaking, not really accomplished much since early 2015.Click to EnlargeBulls, however, note that the May 2016 lows coincided with critical technical support made up of horizontal support (lower purple-dotted line) as well as the 200-week simple moving average (red). Equally important, on the other hand, is that after Wednesday's post-earnings rally, AAPL is now within a few points of these aforementioned previous all-time highs from 2015. Through a technical lens, this could offer up as much resistance as the 2015 lows offered support.In other words, before Apple stock can sustainably break to new all-time highs, a consolidation phase most likely is in order.Looking at the daily chart, we see that since mid-November 2016, AAPL stock has now rallied approximately 25%, which is not a small move for the stock to accomplish in a matter of two-and-a-half months.Click to EnlargeA simple yet accurate observation through the lens of technical analysis is that old all-time highs are not easily overcome on the first try, particularly if the stock has not consolidated below or near those previous all-time highs for some time.Apple's current chart thus is in dire need of some consolidation before it can make a better attempt at fresh all-time highs on a more sustainable basis.How to Trade Apple Stock HereI see two specific trades setting up:If AAPL stock breaks and holds below Wednesday's intraday lows around $127, then the stock could be played from the short side for a mean-reversion move back into the mid- to low $120s. Alternatively, options traders could also look to sell out-of-the-money call spreads on the stock at that time.Quicker traders could look to buy AAPL stock for fast profits should the stock push and hold above Wednesday's intraday highs around $130.50 for a move toward the 2015 highs around $133.Either way, upside in AAPL stock through a multiweek/multimonth lens is likely limited. Trades should be constructed accordingly.Like what you see? Sign up for our dailyBeat the Belle-letter and get Serge's investment advice delivered to your inbox every morning!

The S&P 500 Holds in the Face of Uncertainty;2/2/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOn Wednesday, shares ofApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) jumped 6.1% following a report that showed an increased demand for its iPhone 7. The record increase in revenues of $78.4 billion ended a record of three consecutive quarters of declines, and helped theDow Jones Industrial Averagegain 0.1% by adding 51 points to the index. Apple's gain also helped propel theNasdaqto a gain for the day of 0.5%.makeArticleAd();Apple's gain helped the session to open higher, but the positive impact of one stock's opening didn't' last long. All of the gains of the opening were lost by noon. However, following the noon hour's lows, a Federal Reserve decision to leave interest rates unchanged, and several positive economic reports helped gain back about half of the morning's losses enabling the major indices to close with modest gains.5 Stocks to Buy to Defy a Weak FebruaryAt the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 27 points at 19,891, theS&P 500eked out a point at 2,280, the Nasdaq rose 28 points to close at 5,643 and theRussell 2000closed at 1,361, unchanged. The NYSE's primary exchange traded 1 billion shares with total volume of 3.9 billion shares. The Nasdaq crossed 2.2 billion shares. On the Big Board, decliners edged out advancers by 1.1-to-1, while the Nasdaq broke even. The NYSE's blocks were reported as 6,510 down from 6,786 on Tuesday.Click to EnlargeIn spite of the many underlying uncertainties, the S&P 500 (and the Nasdaq) have maintained support. The S&P 500's December high at 2,277 is the ""line in the sand"" for this major index, as is Nasdaq's January high at 5,574.Conclusion:The January closing highs of the major indices are breakout points that must hold if the short-term and intermediate-term trend is to remain intact.A gap exists on the 500 from 2,292 to 2,286. That gap was partially closed by yesterday's intraday high at 2,289. This technical issue is an important focus for this major index, since a failure to proceed higher could easily lead to a 5% to 10% correction. So far the major indices have resisted the anxiety produced by many uncertainties, choosing to hold or buy rather than give in to the sellers.The line at 2,277 was pierced but recovered.

5 Top Dividend Aristocrats to Buy in February;2/2/2017;"makeZacksArticleAd();The Federal Reserve maintained interest rates in February, providing no update on the next hike. The Fed's reluctance in raising rates should stand in good stead for dividend aristocrats.President Donald Trump's travel ban, in the meanwhile, could result in a possible rise in erratic share price movement this month. The stock market has also, traditionally, seen weak results this month, especially after an election. In such a scenario, investing in dividend aristocrats  seems prudent as they provide higher total returns with lower volatility, which are undoubtedly the 'holy grail' of investing.Fed Leaves Rates UnchangedAs widely expected, the Fed has kept rates unchanged following a two-day policy meeting on Feb 1. The central bank kept its benchmark overnight lending rate target at a range of 0.5% to 0.75%. The bank had lifted rates by a quarter percentage point in December, marking the second hike in more than 10 years.In fact, the central bank penciled three quarter-point moves this year in December. More importantly for investors, the central bank didn't drop any hints of raising rates in the March meet, placing the probability of such a move at only 18%, according to CME Group.In this case, high qualitydividend stockshave become more appealing as their stock prices don't suffer when rates aren't rising. Conversely, bond markets, which tend to benefit from a rise in interest rates, have lost its lure.Trump Stirs Up a TempestThe Fed's positive view of the economy and Apple Inc.'sAAPLstellar earnings helped stocks rally a little higher on Feb 1. However, investors have not yet recovered from the blow of Trump's immigration ban. An executive order by Trump banned immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries, including legal residents and visa holders. Trump had earlier fostered expectations that his administration will be business friendly and therefore should bode well for the equity market. This decision has drawn congressional criticism and widespread protests. These protectionist measures may also cloud the path for pro-business initiatives as several world and corporate leaders condemn the ban.Airlines bore the brunt as well as several airports across the country saw violent protests, disrupting operations to a great extent. Tech firms also faced obstacles in sourcing labor from foreign lands. Trump's first press conference since July also disappointed investors due to lack of policy detail. He severely criticized pharmaceutical companies over high drug prices, dealing a blow to leading biotech stocks.Such uncertainties make dividend paying stocks more attractive as they tend to outperform when the broader markets are subject to gyrations. Notably, the month of February has traditionally seen weak numbers just after the election.February: Traditionally a Weak MonthFebruary has been the weakest month for stocks over the past four decades, averaging just a 0.06% gain. In fact, in post-election years, February tends to be weaker. The average return has decreased 1.85% since 1977.Lest we forget, markets have gone 74 days without a 1% daily decline, hence, the seasonality pattern increases the odds of a wider decline in February.Why Dividend Aristocrats? 5 Solid ChoicesDividend aristocrats outperform other dividend payers on better quality business. This category of stocks reflect a solid financial structure and healthy underlying fundamentals. Such stocks are immune to market vagaries and have also raked in excellent risk-adjusted returns over the last decade. In fact, in the last one year, the S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats Index rallied 19.6%, above the S&P 500's 17.5%.Dividend Aristocrats generated an annualized return of 9.7% over the past 10 years, easily topping the broader market's 6.3% rate. During this period, dividends accounted for 31% of the market's total return, highlighting their importance in determining total shareholder return.We have, thus, selected five such dividend aristocrats to boost your returns.

In the year-ago period, Nokia had reported earnings of €0.15 (17 cents) per share.Net sales declined year over year (on a comparable combined company basis) to €6.7 billion (approximately $7.1 billion). Moreover, the top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.38 billion. The disappointing performance by the Nokia Networks division was due to the challenging market conditions. Moreover, weak sales in Mobile Networks, which is part of Ultra Broadband Networks, contributed to the significant decline.Quarterly adjusted gross margin was 42% in the reported quarter compared with 42.4% a year ago. Operating margin decreased 260 basis points (bps) to 14% on a year-over-year basis. In the fourth quarter, Nokia generated net cash from operating activities of €510 million as against €460 million at the end of 2015.Nokia is rapidly expanding in the field of technology and wireless infrastructure.

The segment includes Ultra Broadband Networks, and IP Networks and Applications. The decline in the Ultra Broadband Networks sub-group by 15% to €4,332 million hurt the segmental sales. The segment's sales also suffered due to a reduction of 12% to €1,976 million in net sales of the IP Networks and Application segment.Notably, net sales declined in all regions, apart from Middle East & Africa, which led to the segment's below-par performance. Net sales declined by 11% in North America,  30% in Latin America,  2% in the Asia Pacific, 33% in Greater China and  17% in Europe. Segmental gross margin improved 50 bps to 40.6% in the reported quarter.

3 Tech Stocks Paying Better Dividends Than Apple;2/2/2017;"Technology stocks, once the domain of high-flying growth investors, are becoming an increasingly generous source of dividends for income investors. The information technology sector led the market by total dividends paid both for the third quarter of 2016 and for the 12 months that ended September 30, according to a FactSet analysis of the 419 dividend payers in Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. Apple (symbolAAPL) was tops in the IT sector, paying $12.2 billion in dividends over the 12-month stretch.But just because Apple handed out the most money to its shareholders doesn't mean it's the best source of income in the sector. In fact, Apple's stock currently yields just 1.8%, even less than the S&P 500's 2.1%. So we set out to find mature tech stocks with solid business outlooks that offer superior yields to Apple. Our search turned up three blue-chip names. How blue? Like Apple, all three of our picks are components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Take a look.makeArticleAd();Cisco SystemsCisco Systems, which makes the routers, switches and modems that form the backbone of the internet, is poised for better-than-expected sales growth, analysts say. A recent survey of its customers by UBS Securities revealed that spending on Cisco products remains a top budgetary priority. The tech company gets good marks for being easy to work with, and two-thirds of respondents said it has the best overall security offering. The growth of cloud-based computing (storing data and applications on remote servers) and the Internet of Things (the expanding digital interconnectivity of everyday items, from cars to refrigerators) are long-term tailwinds for the company and the stock. UBS has a ""buy"" rating on Cisco shares.Analysts, on average, expect Cisco's earnings to rise by just a penny this fiscal year ending July 30, to $2.37 from $2.36, according to a survey by Thomson Reuters. Sales are forecast to slip 1.9% in fiscal 2017. The more bullish case for Cisco stems from projections for the following fiscal year (ending in July 2018), when profits are projected to climb 5% to $2.49 a share, and revenue is expected to gain 2.4%.Cisco's dividend, which dates back to 2011, has increased annually. The company disbursed $5 billion in common dividends for the 12 months ended Oct. 31. That was supported by $12 billion in free cash flow, or cash left over after spending the money required to operate and expand the business.SEE ALSO:10 Stocks Every Retiree Should OwnIntelConsumers are increasingly forgoing desktop computers for mobile devices. As a result, PC sales have become a slowly melting iceberg. Market research firm Gartner found that PC sales fell for eight consecutive quarters as of the third quarter of 2016. That has forced Intel, the world's largest maker of the central processing units that serve as a PC's brain, to find new ways to generate revenue growth.The expansion of cloud-based services has been a boon to Intel, thanks to its market-share dominance in server chips. True, Intel faces changes in customer demands and competition from rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), but analysts at Stifel say it's responding well. ""Intel has been acquiring technologies and recruiting outside managerial talent to prepare for the changing market,"" Stifel analyst Kevin Cassidy, who rates Intel shares a ""buy,"" said in a recent note to clients.Analysts expect 2017 earnings to rise to $2.79 from $2.72 a share in 2016, according to Thomson Reuters. Revenue is forecast to increase 1% to $60.1 billion. Intel paid its first cash dividend in 1992, and the company resumed annual dividend hikes two years ago. Intel's payout ratio, or dividends as a percentage of earnings, is a conservative 37% and below even the S&P 500's average ratio of 40%.SEE ALSO:3 Reasons to Own Apple Stock in RetirementMicrosoftMicrosoft is another tech company that's benefiting from the rise in cloud computing. An increasing number of customers now pay a recurring subscription fee to use its software rather than purchasing it outright. It's proving to be a hot area of growth. ""The closely watched commercial cloud business -- which includes Office 365, Azure and Dynamics 365 -- continued to grow at a torrid rate, reaching over $14.0 billion in annualized revenue in the second quarter [which ended December 31, 2016],"" William Blair & Co. analyst Jason Ader said in a recent note to clients.Importantly, the analyst expects Microsoft to become more profitable over time because of its ""disproportionate growth in its commercial cloud business, which is being boosted by rapid customer adoption of Office 365 and Azure."" Azure is Microsoft's cloud-computing platform, and Office 365 is the subscription version of its popular Office applications. Cloud-based services can have higher profit margins than traditional licensed software.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters project earnings to rise to $2.97 a share for the current fiscal year ending June 30, from $2.79 in fiscal 2016. Revenue for fiscal 2017 is expected to increase 4.9% year over year, to $96.5 billion. For its second quarter, which ended December 31, Microsoft generated $1.3 billion in free cash flow after disbursing $3 billion worth of dividends. The company has paid a dividend to its shareholders since 2003. By contrast, Apple resumed paying a regular quarterly dividend only in 2012, following a 17-year layoff.SEE ALSO:10 Best Dividend-Paying Stocks for 2017"

Is Apple (AAPL) A Double From Here?;2/1/2017;"I talked yesterday about the Fed.  As I said, I think we'll find that the Fed will shift gears again to stay behind the curve on inflation, to let the economy run a little hot.  They met today and it was a non-event. They said nothing to build momentum on their rate hike from December.The news of the day has been Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) earnings.  People over the past couple of years have been calling for the decline in Apple.  They've said it's topped.  They can't innovate in the post-Steve Jobs era.  The iPhone was magic. But reproducing magic isn’t easy.  Once you put a computer in everyone's pocket, there's not much more they can do to it with it. These are all of the quips about Apple's peak.  They may be right.  But Apple's peak, at least as a stock, is greatly exaggerated.They reported a huge positive surprise on earnings yesterday after the close.  The stock was up 6% on the day.  But even before that, I suspect it has become a much loved stock in the past two months in the ""smart money"" investor community.We should see in the coming weeks, as big investors disclose their positioning for the end of Q4, Apple will have returned to a lot of portfolios again.  Warren Buffett, an investor that has made his fortune buying when others are selling, built a big stake at the lows of the year last year.  And it's a perfect Buffett stock.It’s incredibly cheap compared to the market.The stock still trades at 15x earnings.  Much cheaper than the market.  Apple trades at 13x next year’s projected earnings.  The S&P 500 trades at 16.5x.  What about Apple's monster cash position?  Apple has even more cash now -- a record $246 billion. If we excluded the cash from the valuation, Apple market cap goes down from $675 billion to $429 billion.  That would equate to Apple trading at closer to 9x earnings. Though not an “apples to apples” that valuation would group Apple with the likes of these S&P 500 components that trade around 9 times earnings, like:  Dow Chemical, Prudential Financial, Bed Bath & Beyond, a Norwegian chemical company (LBY), and Hewlett Packard Enterprise. It's safe to say no one is debating whether or not Hewlett Packard is at the pinnacle of its business. Yet, if we strip out the cash in Apple, AAPL shares are trading closer to an HPE valuation.Add to that, Apple now has afresh catalystcoming in, Trump policies. The new President Trump is incentivizing Apple (and others) tobring offshore cash hoards back homewith a flat 10% tax.  And Apple makes money – a lot of it.  Acut in the corporate tax ratewill be a boon for earnings.  Two years ago, Carl Icahn argued that Apple should use (a lot more of) their cash to buyback shares – and, with that, valued the stock at double its current levels.makeArticleAd();For help building a high potential portfolio for 2017, follow me in ourBillionaire’s Portfolio, where you look over my shoulder as I follow the world’s best investors into their best stocks.

Apple, Inc. Earnings: 3 Answers From CEO Tim Cook;2/1/2017;"Ahead ofApple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) first-quarter earnings report on Tuesday,   investors were primarily looking for the company to show that it   can reverse its recent declining iPhone business. And Apple didexactly this, reporting 5% year-over-year growth in both iPhone unit and   revenue growth, helping the company's total revenue increase 3%   year over year. Even better, the company said it expected more   growth in its second quarter.But beyond Apple's financial performance, investors likely had   other questions on their minds -- questions more suitable for   management's earning call following the release. To this end, I   laid outthree questions Apple management would hopefully   addressduring the call. As it turns out, Apple management addressed all   three of these important topics.Apple CEO Tim Cook. Image source: Apple.makeArticleAd();Here's how Apple CEO Tim Cook and his management team answered   these three questions on Tuesday:1. How confident is management in its product pipeline?While the iPhone did return to growth in Apple's first   quarter, it was still relatively slow growth. The iPhone's   headwinds have put the pressure on the company to develop new   products to help accelerate growth. While investors obviously   shouldn't have expected Apple to spill the beans on anything   specific on Tuesday, Tim Cook did express confidence in the   company's pipeline of upcoming products.In Apple's first-quarter earnings press release, Cook said   Apple is ""very excited"" about the products in its pipeline. And   during Apple's earnings call, Cook showed even more enthusiasm,   saying, ""we've got some exciting things in the pipeline; I feel   really, really good about it.""2. What could Apple's services revenue growth look like going   forward?Services continue to grow in importance to Apple, and the   company's first quarter was no exception. Services revenue   climbed 18% year over year, growing to about 9% of total sales,   up from about 8% last year. And even this growth understates how   sharply the segment is climbing, as the company's services   segment benefited from a one-off $548 million patent-infringement   payment in the year-ago quarter.App Store sales are helping fuel services growth. Image     source: Apple.Going forward, Cook said (here's aReuters transcriptof the earnings call) that he expects services to become even   more integral to Apple's business:Services are becoming a larger part of our business, and we     expect the revenues to be the size of a Fortune 100 company     this year. Our services offerings are now driving over 150     million paid customer subscriptions. This includes our own     services, and third-party content that we offer on our stores.     We feel great about this momentum, and our goal is to double     the size of our services business in the next four years.These expectations for Apple's services segment translate to a   forecast of about 20% annualized growth over the next four   years.3. If there's a tax break for repatriation, does Apple plan   to take advantage of it?With President Donald Trump saying he plans to offer a one-off   tax holiday for U.S. companies to repatriate their overseas funds   at a lower tax rate, investors have good reason to be interested   in what Apple's CEO thinks of this. After all, of Apple's $246.1   billion in cash and marketable securities, an incredible $230.2   billion is outside of the United States.Fortunately, Cook talked about this potential holiday,   signaling he expected Apple to take full advantage:I am optimistic given what I'm hearing, that there would     likely be some sort of tax reform this year, and it does seem     like there's people in both parties that would favor a     repatriation as a part of that. So I think that's very good for     the country and good for Apple.But Cook said investors will have to wait to see how   repatriated funds would be allocated:What we would do with it -- let's wait and see exactly what     it is -- but as I've said before, we are always looking at     acquisitions. We acquired 15 to 20 companies per year for the     last four years, and we look for companies of all sizes, and     there's not a size that we would not do based on just the size     of it. It's more about the strategic value of it.Beyond acquisitions, Apple could obviously allocate funds   toward other capital investments in its own business, a dividend   increase, a special dividend, share repurchases, or even all of   the above.While these were some of the more important topics covered   during the call, management also covered more details on the   company's services business, its regional results, the smartphone   market, and more.

What Happened in the Stock Market Today;2/1/2017;"Image source: Getty Images.Stocks barely budged on Wednesday despite an interest rate   announcement by the Federal Reserve and a flood of fresh earnings   reports.

Neither group broke far away   from broader market averages, though, and both theFinancial Sector SPDR Select ETF(NYSEMKT: XLF) and the leveragedDirexion Daily Gold Miners Bull 3X ETF(NYSEMKT: NUGT) were essentially unchanged.On the other hand, earnings season produced large price swings   in a few individual stocks, includingApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) andPitney Bowes(NYSE: PBI) .Apple returns to growthApple shares soared 7% to lead the Dow higher after the   company demonstrated that its growth days arefar from over. Revenue rose 3% following three consecutive quarters of   declines on strong demand for its latest iPhone models. Average   selling pricesjumpedthanks to a clear preference on the part of consumers for the   larger iPhone 7 Plus, and that success helped the company trounce   its earnings guidance.The tech titan generated $3.36 per share of profit compared to   expectations of $3.17 per share. ""We're thrilled to report that   our holiday quarter results generated Apple's highest quarterly   revenue ever, and broke multiple records along the way,"" CEO Tim   Cook said in a press release.iPhone 7 Plus. Image source: Apple.Cook and his team drew attention to the company's booming   services business that includes iTunes and App Store purchases.   The segment passed $25 billion of revenue over the prior 12   months and is now responsible for nearly 10% of overall sales.   This quarter's gain was just below 20%, which suggests Apple has   a good shot at doubling services revenue by fiscal 2020.In the meantime, the company guided toward another quarter of   iPhone-led growth ahead, as revenue should come in at $52.5   billion while gross profit margin holds steady at just below 40%   of sales.Pitney Bowes misses expectationsPitney Bowes slumped 18% followingsurprisingly weak quarterly results. The office services specialist reported a 5% sales decline as   it produced adjusted earnings of $0.53 per share. Both the top-   and bottom-line figures were significantly lower than Wall Street   and management had forecast.""Our fourth quarter and full-year results were not what we   wanted or expected,"" CEO Marc Lautenbach said in a press release.   Executives were especially disappointed with their performance in   the software solutions business, which saw a 7% sales decline and   a 16% drop in operating earnings. The miss helped push revenue   down by 4% for the full year so that Pitney Bowes came in below   the lowered outlook it announced in early November.Looking ahead, management believes it has put most of the   sales disruptions, and a good portion of its restructuring   charges, behind it. However, Lautenbach and his team sounded a   similar tone three months ago when they pulled back their 2016   outlook after anespecially weak third quarter. Investors aren't keen to give the company much slack after two   consecutive outings headlined by disappointing operating results,   so the stock took a justifiable beating on Wednesday.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

He elaborated: ""We are   executing on our strategy focused on the IoT and Infrastructure   markets and are seeing our efforts translate into strong   financial results, achieving target model for annual growth,   gross margin, and operating margin in the second half.""Looking forwardFor the first quarter of 2017, Silicon Labs anticipates   revenue of $174 million to $179 million, the midpoint of which   represents 8.9% year-over-year growth. On the bottom line,   Silicon Labs expects that performance to translate to adjusted   earnings per diluted share of between $0.57 and $0.63, up from   $0.51 per share in last year's first quarter. For   perspective -- and though we don't usually pay close attention to   Wall Street's quarterly demands -- analysts were less optimistic,   with consensus estimates calling fiscal first-quarter revenue and   earnings near the low ends of Silicon Labs' guidance ranges.Once again, Silicon Laboratories' relative outperformance was   evident this quarter, as it continues to capitalize on the   increasing ubiquity of connected devices. And even with shares   trading at all-time highs going into this report, it's no   surprise investors were willing to continue bidding up Silicon   Labs stock today.10 stocks we like better than Silicon   LaboratoriesWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Apple Inc.'s iPhone 7 Plus Is a Smash Hit;2/1/2017;"The first quarter of anApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) fiscal year is usually the company's peak quarter,   as it follows the launch of Apple's latest flagship iPhone   device. The iPhone generates the bulk of the company's revenue,   and so the quarter in which Apple sees the most iPhone shipments   is the quarter in which it sees its greatest revenue.Apple's iPhone 7 Plus. Image source: Apple.makeArticleAd();Although there were rumors that Apple was seeing relatively   tepid demand for its latest iPhone models -- the iPhone 7 and the   iPhone 7 Plus -- the company's financial performance tells a   different tale.Apple reported shipping a record 78.29 million iPhones in the   first quarter, handily beating its previous quarterly record of   just shy of 75 million units. CEO Tim Cook said that it saw   ""exceptional demand"" for iPhones that ""beat [Apple's] own   internal expectations.""This robust unit demand didn't come at the expense of average   selling prices, either -- iPhone average selling prices in the   quarter came in at just a hair under $695.Just as the iPhone business is the star of the company's most   recent earnings report, the iPhone 7 Plus appears to be the star   of the iPhone business.iPhone 7 Plus is a smash hitCook said that the iPhone 7 is the company's ""most popular   model,"" but he highlighted the fact that the company saw   ""especially strong demand for iPhone 7 Plus.""Demand was so strong, in fact, that Cook says that the iPhone   7 Plus made up ""a higher portion of the new product mix than   [Apple has] ever seen with Plus models in the past.""To further drive the point home, even given the   stronger-than-expected unit shipment performance during the   quarter, Apple reported that ""demand for iPhone 7 Plus exceeded   supply throughout the quarter"" and that the company only ""came   into supply/demand balance in January.""And, finally, it's worth pointing out that Apple is seeing   this unexpectedly strong iPhone 7 Plus demand even though it   priced the devices at a $20 premium to where it had priced   previous iPhone Plus models (which previously carried $100   premiums over their non-Plus counterparts).Clearly, Apple's customer base likes what the company did with   the iPhone 7 Plus and was willing to pay a premium for the added   features.In the past, Apple had differentiated its Plus models with   larger, sharper displays as well as some very minor camera   enhancements (i.e., optical image stabilization). However, this   time around, in addition to the usual points of differentiation,   Apple included a dual-lens camera on the iPhone 7 Plus which   enabled an interesting optical zoom feature.The key lesson here is that if Apple brings interesting   innovations and features to premium products and tries to charge   a premium for those features, then it may very well get paid for   those features.Open sesameAt this point, it's obvious what Apple should do next --   introduce even higher-priced iPhones with even more interesting   features and points of differentiation. Apple shouldn't go wild   adding in every feature under the sun, but its product definition   and marketing teams should now have the freedom to go ahead and   build products with higher cost structures that are intended to   sell at higher price points.Such products, launched in conjunction with models priced at   the more ""typical"" price points, could be quite successful for   the company. In fact, current rumors suggest that Apple is   planning to launch two straightforward successors to this year's   iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, and then higher up in the product   stack, the company may launch an iPhone with a curved OLED   display and other goodies.If the upcoming OLED iPhone is a fundamentally compelling   product -- and I think it will be -- then I could see Apple   successfully charging even more for it than it does for its top   iPhone 7 Plus models.The next couple of years could be very interesting for Apple's   iPhone product line and, ultimately, its business!10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock Won’t Stop at $12;2/1/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOnce left for dead, semiconductor giantAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMD), has come back over the past two years, proving the doubters wrong. With gains of 400% over the past year, AMD stock haspunished those who bet against it. But is it now time to take profits?makeArticleAd();Source:Matthew Rutledge via FlickrNope.AMD stock had a slow start to 2017, off about 6% before Tuesday night's fourth-quarter earnings report, is back in the black thanks to a Wednesday surge after showing off some of the operational dominance it sported in a rip-roaring 2016.Expectation for the QuarterFor the quarter that ended December, Wall Street expected the company to report a loss of 2 cents per share on revenues of $1.07 billion. AMD beat on both fronts, recording revenues of $1.11 billion and a loss of just 1 cent per share.Recent results fromIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) hinted that Advanced Micro might be in for a Street-beating quarter.7 Stocks to Buy That Could Double by 2018On Friday John Vinh, analyst at Pacific Crest noted that Intel's results, which reflected less-bad personal computer trends, suggests strong growth for the sector. Notably, Vinh cited AMD as benefiting from ""strength in gaming and high-end PCs."" To that end, the analysts also said the improvements in high-end PCs could reduce concerns about high-end GPU inventory at desktop graphics card manufacturers.Well, a beat is what we got, and that came on the power of AMD's graphics chips, which saw revenues grow 15% year-over-year.The Key to AMD: GPUsGPU, or Graphics Processing Unit, is a big business for AMD. Those chips render images, animations and video for display on computer's screens. And the strength of that business has been a key component of AMD's turnaround. In the third quarter, reported in October, AMD posted a 23% year-over-year jump in revenue of $1.3 billion. The company benefited from strong growth in its popular Radeon line GPUs as revenue from that segment rose 11% year over year.This quarter, GPUs helped once more. Revenues in Computing and Graphics grew 28% year-over-year, thanks in part to higher average GPU selling prices.The company recently announced that its FirePro server GPUs have been selected byAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL) to power its cloud platform in 2017. All told, AMD's GPU strength has begun to gain traction in different verticals, which should help it narrow the market share gap with leaderNvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA).Bottom Line for AMD StockAMD's report was full of other positives, such as an expansion of gross margins from 30% to 32%, and slight gains in its Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom business (4%).Still, graphics and high performance are the name of the game.AMD stock surged 14% higher on Wednesday's reaction to fourth-quarter results, putting shares at highs last seen in 2017. The stock has returned more than 400% in 12 months - better than the 20% one-year gain in theS&P 500.And even still, AMD is showing that there's little let-up in the growth ramp.I expect AMD stock to reach $13 in 2017, delivering 22% gains on the back of greater GPU adoption and rising margins.As of this writing, Richard Saintvilus did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceWill the Apple Inc.

Apple, Inc. Earnings: Why Shares Are Trading Higher;2/1/2017;"Following the company's first-quarter earnings report on   Tuesday, shares ofApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) are up sharply on Wednesday. At the time of this   writing,Apple stockis trading at about $123, up more than 5% for the trading day.   The move helped the stock hit a new 52-week high. Apple stock's   move higher on Monday adds to the increasingly bullish sentiment   toward the stock recently. In the past six months, shares are up   about 23%, easily outperforming the S&P 500's 5% gain during   the same period.Investor optimism toward Apple stock recently is likely due to   a wide range of factors, including its conservative valuation,   speculation about a major redesign for Apple's expected iPhone   launch this fall, and Samsung's recall of its Galaxy Note 7. But   one trend in Apple's business is likely serving as a primary   driver for the company's rising stock price: a rebound in iPhone   sales.iPhone 7. Image source: Apple.makeArticleAd();Rebounding iPhone salesTo understand why recently rebounding iPhone sales are so   important to investors, it's important to realize how steeply   iPhone sales were declining on a year-over-year basis just a few   quarters ago.MetricQ3 2016Q2 2016iPhone unit sales growth (YOY)(15%)(16%)iPhone revenue growth (YOY)(23%)(18%)Total revenue (YOY)(15%)(13%)Fiscal quarters shown. Data retrieved from Apple's earnings   releases. Table by author.At the iPhone segment's worst point last year, unit sales and   revenue in the company's fiscal third quarter of 2016 declined   15% and 23%, respectively, dragging total revenue 15% lower   compared to the year-ago quarter. As Apple was reporting   significant year-over-year declines in its largest product   segment, investors were concerned about how the product segment   would perform over the longer term.But as early as Apple's fourth-quarter earnings report in   October, it was clear that the tech giant's iPhone business could   soon end a three-quarter streak of year-over-year declines in   total revenue. The company guided for first-quarter revenue to be   between $76 billion and $78 billion, up from $75.9 billion in the   year-ago quarter. Considering that iPhone accounts for over 60%   of Apple's trailing-12-month revenue, this meant management was   optimistic about the company's new September-launched iPhone 7   and 7 Plus.Sure enough, iPhone sales rebounded.Fiscal quarters shown. Data retrieved from Apple's earnings     releases. Chart by author.Apple's first-quarter earnings release this week confirmed the   company's return to iPhone growth, with Apple reporting   year-over-year iPhone unit and revenue growth of 5%, helping the   company's total revenue rise 3%.Can iPhone growth persist?The big question going forward, of course, is whether Apple's   iPhone business can keep growing. In the near term, it looks like   management expects another quarter of growth. Apple said it   expected total second-quarter revenue to be between $51.5 billion   and $53.5 billion, up from $50.6 billion in the year-ago quarter.   With iPhone accounting for the bulk of Apple's total revenue,   this guidance for growth in total revenue likely means management   expects growth for the iPhone, too.Beyond Apple's second quarter, however, it's not as certain   that Apple's iPhone sales growth can be sustained throughout   fiscal 2017. However, a return to growth for iPhone 7 -- a   product with a three-year-old form factor -- is promising news,   highlighting how well the company's products continue to resonate   with customers.Combining Apple stock's conservative valuation with growth in   the company's biggest product segment, it's easy to see why   investors are optimistic about the stock's potential,   recently.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Facebook Inc (FB) TV App Is More Trouble Than You Think;2/1/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) opened for trade Feb. 1 at an all-time high - a market cap of $365 billion - on the strength of its dominance in mobile apps. But the big news is that Facebook is about to challenge the video league leaders with a mobile app for existing streaming boxes like theApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) TV. The question is, what will this do for FB stock?makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockMoving into TV through an app rather than a device makes sense, given the failure of the original Facebook phone and its overwhelming success with apps for others' phones.FB is already bankrolling the creation of videos for the video tab of itsmobile app.So where does Facebook fit its service into the evolving market, and what does its presence as a broadcaster mean to its claims not to be a media company?FB Stock: TV vs. PhoneThe company is already a presence in video thanks toFacebook Live, which allows live streaming of video on the service and it has aPresidential endorsement.10 Stocks to Buy That Already Make America GreatFB has prepared to offer longer videos by introducing ""mid-roll"" ads - ads that play in the middle of a video - to its line-up, making the service more TV-like.Over time, this might allow Facebook to compete directly withAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN),Netflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX) andAlphabet Inc's(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) YouTube in the growing market for streaming services.The problem is that there is a big difference between the experience you get on a mobile phone and what you want on a TV screen. A phone is active, a TV is passive. A phone may support videos of a few minutes, while people will watch TV for hours-and-hours.There is an assumption in the breathless reporting of Facebook's latest move that TV is easy; that it's just something you throw money at. Given the success of Netflix in generating subscribers and Emmys, and Amazon in generating Prime members and Oscar buzz, that is an easy mistake to make.Worth the Candle?For Facebook stock, this may not be as huge a deal as analysts think.Netflix revenue is only a fraction of FB stock's. Analysts expect Facebook to deliver over $27 billion in 2016 revenue when it reports after the market closes Feb. 1. This is against roughly $9 billion for Netflix. NFLX also brings just 3% of that revenue to the bottom line, while FB stock brings nearly one-third of revenue to its net income line.Entering the world of creating television poses another risk. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has repeatedly saidhe doesn't run a media company, that his is just a communications service. Media companies have responsibilities to truth and accuracy that, say, phone companies don't have - responsibilitiesthat can limit profitability.If Facebook is going to license content from media suppliers, whether live or scripted, it becomes a media company, subject to political and public scrutiny for its programming choices, on a global basis. This is a dance FB stock shareholders should fear, because it costs money to play, and carries risk.Can Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Jump Over These Hurdles?But Facebook may now have no choice in the matter. The big screen is the last frontier for internet services, it's where everyone is heading. FB stock does not want to be left behind.The Bottom Line on Facebook StockWhile most analysts are jumping for joy over the Facebook TV app news, I am a lot more cautious. This move has enormous implications for the entire company, for how it's perceived and (more important) what it costs to run.FB, like Alphabet, prefers to manage itself through algorithms. Algorithms scale in ways people do not. Facebook is starting to bow to pressure on the media front,hiring Campbell Brownto coordinate media alliances. Now it's about to become a TV network, or at least a streaming service.What will that mean to its profitability and growth? I think they both slow, because people aren't algorithms and talent has temper that code does not have. Politics can kill the media star.Dana Blankenhornis a financial and technology journalist.

Will the Apple Inc. HomeKit Beat Amazon’s Alexa? (AAPL);2/1/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) announced HomeKit - its strategy for becoming the center of the smart home - in June 2014.Amazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) revealed its Alexa-powered Echo smart speaker that November.makeArticleAd();Source: Apple/AmazonWhile there are currently several dozen HomeKit compatible smart home products, Amazon's Alexa is now connected to thousands of smart products and services and has spread from the Echo to third-party devices.On the surface, it looks as though Amazon has outmaneuvered and thoroughly trounced Apple. But despite the seemingly insurmountable lead and momentum, AAPL could still end up beating AMZN in this smart home race.Here's how.Apple Chose the Closed Approach With HomeKitApple tends to be extremely cautious. Its software is designed to be user-friendly and secure. iPhone apps can't just be downloaded from anywhere; they need to go through the official App Store and that requires approval by AAPL. Third-party hardware needs to be certified by Apple before it can be marketed as being iOS-compatible.It's that ""walled"" approach that hasmade the iPhone more securethan smartphones runningAlphabet Inc's(NASDAQ:GOOGL) Android operating system.With the iPhone and Siri - Apple's voice assistant - at the center of Apple's smart home strategy, that focus on security, compatibility and ease of use carried over toHomeKit. Manufacturers who want to make their smart devices HomeKit-compatible face a daunting series of requirements.Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Has a New Hero: Services!As pointed out in a recent Reuters article ondiffering smart home approaches, this includes being forced to buy a special HomeKit chip, being limited to approved (and more expensive than average) Bluetooth and Wi-Fi chips and even extends to manufacturing being limited to factories that are certified by Apple. End-to-end encryption is mandatory. Once a HomeKit product is ready, it faces extensive testing by Apple engineers to ensure compatibility.Thenit may be sold. That process alone can take three to five months.So you have additional costs, the procedural red tape and a delay. It's easy to understand whyApple currently lists only 75 or so HomeKit-compatible devices. And half of those are either different color options or regional variations of the same product.Amazon Alexa Is Open for BusinessAmazon took a radically different approach with its Echo speaker and Alexa. The company openly courted third-party companies to develop Alexa ""skills"" or software-enabled interactions with an Amazon Alexa-powered device.A skill can be the ability to tell Alexa to order anUber. It could also be telling Alexa to turn on your home's smart lights or to start your electric car. The process is simple. Amazon provides an example showinghow to build an Alexa skill in 60 minutes, and that includes the time needed to create a developer account. Submit the skill to AMZN for a quick verification, and it's published.That's how Amazon Alexa tripled its available skills in just three months last year, hitting 3,000 in September. If that sounds impressive, by CES 2017 in January, it had hit more than 7,000 Alexa skills.In addition to skills, Amazon also encourages third parties to integrate Alexa functionality into their products. That way, consumers get the Alexa experience without requiring an Echo speaker.That's a far easier process than Apple HomeKit certification. A ""Works with Alexa"" label takes about 10 days to obtain (it can even be issued by third party labs) and doesn't require special chips. According to the Reuters post, that has resulted in over 250 products that are Alexa-certified. We saw some of these at CES, including third-party speakers with Alexa and even home appliances with built-in Alexa capability.Smart Home Security: Apple Strength, Amazon Alexa VulnerabilityThe differing approaches of AMZN and AAPL have led to Alexa rapidly leaping to a massive lead over HomeKit in the smart home. However, there is one scenario where this could change rapidly.Security is increasingly becoming an issue for smart, connected devices. Apple's HomeKit approach emphasizes security, to the point of forcing the use of specialized chips and even certified manufacturing facilities.Amazon's Alexa strategy, on the other hand, leaves its platform relatively exposed. Amazon told Reuters it can't guarantee the security of third-party devices running Alexa. Those thousands of Alexa skills also integrate with third-party services that may have their own vulnerabilities.Trade of the Day: Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock No Longer a Home RunAll it would take is one catastrophic hacking for a PR disaster that turns consumers off Alexa. As CNET puts it in a review of thehacking risks for different smart home standards: ""Don't assume that a device has high security standards just because it works with Alexa.""Bottom LineThere's no disputing the fact that Amazon completely caught Apple and others off guard with its stealthy approach of sneaking Alexa into the home using its Echo connected speaker.Before the Echo, it was generally assumed that a smartphone would be the natural smart home controller. Making Alexa integration so open has also paid off for AMZN, resulting in a formidable lead in the smart home in a very short time. That lead may well turn into complete domination of the connected home. But Amazon's open approach may also prove to be its Achilles heel.Should hackers turn their attention to Amazon Alexa, the resulting headlines may flip the equation and put the much more secure Apple HomeKit on top in the long run.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceApple Inc.

Nokia Corp (ADR) (NOK) Stock Is Still Hobbling;2/1/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsNokia Corp (ADR)(NYSE:NOK) is quintessentially Finnish - beautiful, rugged, quirky and a bit tragic. Once considered the preeminent mobile phone platform, its reign was challenged briefly byBlackBerry Ltd(NASDAQ:BBRY), then permanently byApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). Today, NOK stock is more than just a phone company, but will Wall Street care?makeArticleAd();Source:Open Grid Scheduler / Grid Engine via Flickr (Modified)Its fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 earnings report is set for release before the opening bell on Feb. 2.Would-be buyers and traders have a tough call to make. We all love stories of the great comeback, and Nokia stock is a candidate. Shedding its legacy image as a boxy-cell-phone manufacturer, NOK stock has been extremely acquisitive.We're not just talking about the buyout ofAlcatel-Lucent, although that is a big part of the story. It's also the procurement of lesser known assets that will assert Nokia's new role as apublic networksprovider.At the same time, we're talking about NOK stock here. Recently,InvestorPlacecontributor Will Ashworth slammed Nokia stock as still being ""a dog with fleas,"" borrowing a line from the iconic movieWall Street.It's a fitting description of a company which has ""delivered a scintillating annualtotal returnover the past 15 years of -7.14%, more than 11 percentage points worse than theS&P 500.""7 Stocks to Buy That Could Double by 2018Whatever management has up their sleeves, they better get to it. The markets are many things, but patient usually isn't one of them.The Nitty Gritty of Nokia EarningsLet's take a deeper look at the Nokia earnings. The average consensus estimate for earnings per share is 8 cents - smack in the middle of the forecast spectrum. For the top line, analysts are predicting sales to come in a range of $6.8 billion at the low to $7.6 billion at the high, with a $7.2 billion consensus.To say that the Nokia earnings environment is challenged is putting it mildly. First off, recent performances by NOK stock leave a lot to be desired. Fiscal 2016 is mostly a disappointment, with two misses and a narrow beat.Unless Nokia is planning to pull the proverbial rabbit out of the hat, I'm not sure what they can do. The financials for Nokia stock aren't exactly inspiring.Not surprisingly, Zacks Equity Research prospects for Nokia earnings are dim. Their analysts rank NOK stock as a ""sell,"" citing a litany of problems. Chief among them is the patent war that Nokia finds itself embroiled in with Apple. After losing the mobile phone business to Cupertino, NOK has devolved into whatInvestorPlacecontributor Dana Blankenhorn calls a""patent troll.""That's all fun and games when you pester from your home turf. But Nokia seemed to forget the first rule of trolling: don't troll those that can beat the crap out of you. Mighty Apple has had enough, and they're going to leverage their 22:1valuation disparityagainst Nokia.Again, as Blankenhorn states, that forces NOK stock into a weak hand.NOK Stock Is Wickedly UnpredictableClick to EnlargeStepping aside from the granularity of Nokia earnings, trading the shares based on its financial reports has a dubious history. Since Q4 of fiscal 2013, the average performance of Nokia stock quarter-to-quarter is a pretty sad -1.9%. Really, you just have to pull up the chart from the fall of 2014. It's just like ""Stairway to Heaven,"" only in the opposite direction.What that tells you is that if you do intend to trade Nokia earnings, do so quickly and firmly. Trying to make up for losses usually results in an extension of those losses. And the markets do not make it easy. In the last three reports, Nokia stock was positive heading towards the earnings release. On the day of, NOK fell to an average of 6%.Can GoPro Inc (GPRO) Stock Escape Its Bearish Dogma?For those who want to try their hand at a little Wall Street Russian roulette, a tip of the hat to you! For everybody else, I would just stay away from NOK stock. There are deep-seated fundamental challenges with the company that have yet to be adequately addressed.Until that day comes, Nokia stock remains a liability.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceThe Top 10 Dow Dividend Stocks for FebruaryThe 5 Best Stocks to Buy for Big Emerging Markets ProfitsThe postNokia Corp (ADR) (NOK) Stock Is Still Hobblingappeared first onInvestorPlace."

What Apple's (AAPL) Earnings Say About The Future;2/1/2017;"When you regularly give your opinion on something as unpredictable as financial markets, gloating when you get something right is rarely a good idea. That is especially true when those opinions arearchivedfor all to see; it's too easy for a reader to check out that archive and find examples of when the market and hindsight combine to make even logical arguments seem foolish. I am fully aware of that, but when it comes to yesterday’searnings release from Apple(AAPL), I will still say""told you!""What really matters about the Apple release to investors is certainly not that I got it right, nor is it even that the tech giant returned to growth in revenue for the first time in a year, nor that the already great margins at Apple increased. Those last two are important, but necessarily backward looking, as all hard data in an earnings release are by definition.What matters most is what the report tells us about the future and there the message was somewhat mixed.makeArticleAd();The official guidance for Q1 2017 contained in the release fell just short of Wall Street’s expectations, which would normally be enough of a negative to more than offset the good historical results. In this case, though, a look at where Apple succeeded in Q4 2016 suggests that that guidance may just be another example of Apple’s past tendency to err on the side of under-promising and over-delivering when it comes to guidance. That is why, even though growth stalled last year, AAPL has beaten EPS expectations in three of the last four quarters.First and foremost, iPhone sales hit another record. That is particularly significant as not that long ago many were predicting that Google parent Alphabet (GOOG:GOOGL)’s move into the phone business would do Apple some serious harm. It looks now as if those saying that were about as accurate as those that maintained that the Windows phone from Microsoft (MSFT) or the Amazon (AMZN) Fire phone would be the next big thing.The fact is that the iPhone has an iconic status that looks almost impossible to challenge. Even phones that are objectively better in some ways, such as memory capacity, camera resolution, or speaker quality for example, cannot take market share. As Apple advances the iPhone with each release, beating them on those and other fronts becomes harder, but remains, according to the evidence so far, a pointless exercise. As long as that dynamic remains, holding Apple stock and adding to holdings at times of weakness still makes sense for investors.The weakness in this release was mainly in one area; iPad sales declined for the twelfth successive quarter. That, however, was offset to some extent by strong sales of Macs and Apple Watches. For the latter we are reliant on the word of Tim Cook as Apple doesn’t release a breakdown of watch sales, but, as I pointed out in the article referenced above, anybody who tried to buy a Series Two watch as a Christmas gift is probably aware that sales were at least more than Apple expected. None were available in any of the five states where I tried and most stores have just now received inventory.That shortage of watches, combined with Cook’s admission that they seriously underestimated demand for the iPhone 7 Plus, means that the record sales reported yesterday were achieved with a background of supply constraints. Given that and the fact that there was considerable growth in areas such as services and enterprise operations that still have lots of room for Apple to expand, the message underlying yesterday’s earnings is that, despite conventional wisdom, growth can still be achieved."

"Apple, Inc. Earnings: Why the ""Most Accurate"" Apple Analyst Blew It";2/1/2017;"On Tuesday afternoon,Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) posted strong earnings results for the first   quarter of its 2017 fiscal year. Revenue beat analysts' forecasts   and the company's own guidance range. Earnings per share   comfortably beat the average analyst estimate as well. Finally,   iPhone sales rose 5% year over year, to 78.3 million units; most   analysts had been expecting a smaller increase -- or even a   decline.Apple posted strong iPhone sales for the critical holiday     quarter. Image source: Apple.makeArticleAd();One of those analysts wrongly expecting an iPhone sales   decline was Ming-Chi Kuo of Taiwan's KGI Securities. In the past   few years, Kuo has gained a reputation among many investors for   being the ""most accurate Apple analyst."" The fact that he whiffed so badly on his iPhone sales forecast   is an important reminder to investors not to rely too much on   analysts' forecasts.Understanding the ""most accurate"" Apple analystMing-Chi Kuo has very good sources -- either in Apple's supply   chain or at the company itself -- giving him advance warning of   new product features and production plans. He isn't perfect, but   he's one of the best sources out there for news about Apple's   future products.Ming-Chi Kuo correctly predicted many features of the iPhone     7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Image source: Apple.For example, Kuocorrectly predictedmost of the key features of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus prior   to those models being officially unveiled last September. That   included obscure details like the fact that there wouldn't be   32GB versions of the new jet black iPhones.Kuo also has a pretty good track record for short-term   shipment forecasts. A few days before Apple's Q1 earnings report   two years ago, he predicted that Apple had sold 73 million   iPhones during the holiday quarter, when most analysts still   expected a shipment number well below 70 million. In fact, Apple   reported that it had shipped 74.5 million iPhones.However, Kuo's competitive advantage appears to be limited to   picking up supply chain rumors. When it comes to estimating   demand for Apple's products, his record is far less pristine.Underestimating iPhone sales by a mileFor the past several months, Ming-Chi Kuo had stuck to a   forecast that Apple would ship 70 million-75 million iPhones in   the first quarter. At the midpoint of that range, iPhone sales   would have been down 3% year over year, whereas iPhone sales   actuallyincreased5%.This doesn't fully capture how far off Kuo's expectations   were, though. Prior to late September, he had expected Apple to   ship just 65 million iPhones in Q1, down 13% year over year.The further you zoom out, the worse Kuo's predictions have   been. Back in April, he stated that in a best-case scenario,   Apple would ship 205 million iPhones for the full 2016 calendar   year. (His worst-case scenario was 190 million shipments.) Apple   actually shipped 215.4 million iPhones for the full year.Don't trust analysts too muchInvestors who soldApple stocklast year -- or decided not to buy it -- based on Kuo's   relatively bearish projections have missed out on a big rally.   Since bottoming out around $90 last May, Apple stock has come   roaring back, reaching $125 in after-hours trading on Tuesday   afternoon. This shows the danger of relying too much on analysts'   forecasts.Apple Stock Performance, data byYCharts.Following top analysts for a stock you own is a good way to   stay up to date on the latest trends and the general outlook for   the next few quarters. However, while Wall Street analysts may in   theory be the ""experts,"" even the best ones can make some big   mistakes. For individual investors, it's important to understand   when to trust an analyst's predictions.For Apple, Ming-Chi Kuo is an important analyst to follow for   learning about potential new products and early production plans,   because of his supply chain connections. However, Apple's sales   results ultimately depend on demand.Being plugged in to the supply chain doesn't help much in   forecasting demand. Perhaps Kuo can accurately estimate how many   components Apple's suppliers are building. That shows how many   devices Apple plans to build -- and, by extension, how much   demand Apple expects to see. But build plans are fluid and   routinely change based on actual demand.Thus, while Kuo is great at calling the play-by-play of what   Apple is doing now, his analysis is less reliable looking further   into the future. Investors who have followed his advice over the   past several quarters just learned that lesson the hard way.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Advanced Micro (AMD) Q4 Loss In Line, View Disappoints;2/1/2017;"Advanced Micro DevicesAMDreported loss of 4 cents per share in fourth-quarter 2016, which matched the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Revenues increased 15.4% year over year to $1.11 billion primarily driven by higher GPU sales. However, revenues decreased 15.4% sequentially, primarily due to seasonally soft sales figures for its semi-custom System on Chips (SoCs). Notably, revenues were well above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.07 billion.AMD's shares rose 1.2% in after-hour trading. We note that shares have outperformed the ZacksElectronics Semiconductorsindustry over the last one year. While the industry gave a positive return of 67.2%, AMD gained a whopping 384.6%.The company benefited from strong demand for its graphics products. However, AMD's first-quarter 2017 will be impacted by seasonal weakness.RevenuesAdvanced Micro has two reportable segments -Computing and Graphics(focused on the traditional PC market) andEnterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom(focusing on adjacent high-growth opportunities). The details of these segments are discussed below:Computing and Graphics includes desktop and notebook processors and chipsets, discrete GPUs and professional graphics. This segment accounted for 54.2% of revenues and was up 27.1% sequentially and 27.7% year over year to $600 million.Notably, this segment's revenues grew on an annualized basis for the first time since 2011 as AMD's increased efforts to strengthen this particular segment paid off.Also, the segment posted the highest revenue in the last two years. Client revenues were the highest in the last seven quarters. Graphics processor revenues were also the highest in the last 11 quarters.During the reported quarter, strong adoption of the company's seventh generation notebook accelerated processing units (APUs) drove growth for the company. While desktop processor sales improved on a sequential basis, it declined on a year-over-year basis.The company also won a number of high-end design deals with global original equipment manufacturers over its Ryzen desktop processor that is expected to be launched in early Mar 2017.AMD's Polaris line of GPUs witnessed increased adoption in the fourth quarter. Also, Radeon Pro 400 mobile GPUs were launched, which are used in Apple'sAAPLpremium segment notebooks.The Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment includes server and embedded processors, dense servers, semi-custom SoC products, engineering services and royalties. This segment brought in the remaining 45.8% of revenues, down 39.4% sequentially but up 3.7% year over year to $506 million.The year-over-year increase was driven by higher sales of embedded processor sales and game consoles by MicrosoftMSFTand Sony that are powered by AMD's chips.The segment witnessed increased adoption in targeted markets. Notably, the company continues to gain traction in Naples, Italy.Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS   SurpriseAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. Price, Consensus and   EPS Surprise|Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. QuoteOperating ResultsNon-GAAP gross margin (excluding Wafer Supply Agreement (WSA) charges) was 31.7%, which expanded a whopping 494% sequentially but only 24% on a year-over-year basis.Adjusted operating expenses of $354 million increased 0.6% sequentially and 6.6% year over year.Non-GAAP operating loss was $3 million compared with a loss of $49 million in the year-ago quarter and loss of $293 million in the previous quarter.Mentor Graphics PartnershipAdvanced Micro's recent strategic partnership with Mentor Graphics on embedded technology will offer more choice to embedded developers in the x86 architecture high-performance computing segment. As more and more devices become interconnected, Advanced Micro's efforts to further strengthen its position in the burgeoning embedded markets will reap benefits. (Read:AMD and Mentor Graphics Ink Deal on Embedded Technology).Google DealIn November, the company announced that its FirePro server GPUs have been selected by AlphabetGOOGLto power its cloud platform in 2017. These developments are expected to help the company gain more traction in the GPU space and close in the market share gap with NVIDIA. (Read:AdvancedMicro Scales New Highs, Clinches Deal with Google).Balance SheetAdvanced Micro exited the fourth quarter with cash and cash equivalent balance of $1.26 billion, up $6 million from the previous quarter.During the quarter, the company raised approximately $1.4 billion in cash, before issuance costs, as a result of issuing $690 million of common stock and $700 million of Convertible Notes due 2026.Inventory was $751 million, up 10.8% on a year-over-year basis but down 2.7% sequentially. Total debt (short term and long term) was $1.43 billion, down $0.2 billion sequentially.GuidanceManagement expects first-quarter 2017 revenues to decrease 11% sequentially (+/- 3%), primarily due to seasonal weakness in semi-custom and graphics products. If the company manages to achieve the mid-point of its guidance, it will translate to 18% growth in revenues on a year-over-year basis.Gross margin is likely to be 33% while non-GAAP operating expenses are estimated to be $360 million.On the other hand, interest expense, taxes and others will amount to $30 million. Inventories are expected to remain flat on a sequential basis.Our TakeThe decent fourth-quarter results reflected AMD's improving position in key markets with the introduction of several APUs and GPUs. Moreover, partnerships with the likes of Google for the supply of Radeon Pro GPUs and FirePro server GPUs are positive in our view.Notably the company trails NVIDIA as the second-largest manufacturer of graphics chips for high-end computing and is gradually gaining traction in the space.Additionally, upcoming products like Ryzen and Zen are expected to drive the top line going ahead.Zacks RankAdvanced Micro has Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank stocks here.Zacks' Top 10 Stocks for 2017In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2017?Who wouldn't?

Amgen, Inc. (AMGN) Q4 Earnings Preview;2/1/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAs it's customary withAmgen, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMGN), the biotech giant topped analysts' expectation in each of the first three quarters of 2016. Chances are that it'll top expectations once more when it reports its fourth-quarter and full-year 2016 figures on Feb. 2. So if you're following AMGN stock, you don't need to worry about Amgen's profits.makeArticleAd();Source:Richard Masoner via FlickrInstead, you'll want to watch the following items Thursday when Amgen reports its fourth-quarter results:#1: Enbrel Sales TrendCompared to the third quarter of 2015, Amgen reported flat product sales in Q3 2016. This was mostly due to its top-selling drug, Enbrel, losing ground. Sales for the drug had increased 24% in Q1 and 10% in Q2, but in the third quarter, total Enbrel sales were $1.452 billion, versus $1.459 billion in the year-ago period.The problem doesn't seem to be seasonal fluctuation, considering that Enbrel sales grew by 30% in Q3 2015, compared to Q3 2014.7 Awful Stocks You Need To Ditch Right AwayThe problem is that competition is catching up. Amgen usually says, ""offset partially by the impact of competition"" when giving details about Enbrel sales. However, in Q3 2016, ""partially"" was conspicuously absent. Did someone just forget to copy-and-paste? Maybe. Maybe not.AMGN stock holders should pay attention to see if Enbrel will resume growth through increased volume, as opposed to price hike.Enbrel faces three major growth barriers.First, it competes againstAbbVie Inc's(NYSE:ABBV) Humira and Johnson & Johnson's Remicade. This leads to the second challenge.Stiff competition necessitates incremental rebates to payers to maintain its formulary position.The third challenge is the biosimilar availability. For instance, the FDA has approved Erelzi, an Enbrel biosimilar byNovartis AG (ADR)(NYSE:NVS).Put simply, further lackluster Enbrel growth would weigh on AMGN stock.#2: Amgen's Drug PricingInvestors also should look closely at how fast Amgen is hiking prices.I raised concerns about Amgen stockgrowing sales by increasing drug prices, instead of higher volumes, after the company reported its Q2 2015 earnings. Almost two years on, the trend of growing sales with price hikes is still commonplace at AMGN.From a business perspective, it's smart to try to squeeze out every possible dollar from your inventions. However, the U.S. government is standing up against it. President Donald Trump told drugmakers in aJan. 31 meetingthat ""we have to get the prices down.""This won't be good for the top and bottom lines of any drugmaker. However, for a company who thrives on hiking drug prices like AMGN, the downside gets bigger.#3: How Did Repatha Perform?Repatha is heralded as potentially one of Amgen's best sellers. The company said the drug caters to ""serious diseases with significant unmet needs."" However, it brought in a meager $40 million in Q3.One barrier to market growth is that payers have employed utilization-management procedures, which limited patients' ability to gain access to Repatha. Execs said during Q3 earnings call that they're working with payers and providers to allow unlabeled patient access. Investors should look to see if collaborations with payers and providers are yielding significant Repatha growth.Alphabet Inc (GOOGL): The Cheapest $800 Stock I KnowThe drug, which currently competes withSanofiSA (ADR)(NYSE:SNY) andRegeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc's(NASDAQ:REGN) Praluent, had a 55% share of new-to-brand prescriptions (NBRx) in Q4, according to an Amgen presentation at this year's JPMorgan Healthcare Conference. Still, AMGN stock holders probably want to know just how much in sales that amounted to.But it has to be noted that an ongoing court case that Amgen filed against Sanofi and Regeneron onpatent infringementgrounds is tipping the scale in Rapatha's favor for now.Finally, investors should pay attention to see if low expenses is continuing and will continue at Amgen. Since the beginning of 2015, AMGN has reduced its total expenses by roughly 3.7% to 13.22%. Keeping expenses low will be critical to future profitability, especially in Trump's recent focus on drugmakers.Earnings apart, I believe the uncertainties surrounding the future make AMGN stock less attractive.As of this writing, Craig Adeyanju did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceApple Inc.

Stock Market News for February 01, 2017;2/1/2017;"U.S. stocks ended mostly lower on Tuesday amid signs that momentum following President Donald Trump's election victory in November was fading. His signing of an executive order to temporary restrict immigration saw weekend chaos and backlash, eventually affecting stocks. Industrial, technology and financials shares tanked outweighing gains among traditional safe sectors including health-care and utilities. Meantime, a gauge of consumer confidence retreated in January from its highest level in 15 years. Despite such setbacks, major indexes ended the month higher in what were their first January gains since 2013, while the Nasdaq ended in the green on Tuesday thanks to sharp gains in biotech stocks.makeArticleAd();For a look at the issues currently facing the markets, make sure to read today'sAhead of Wall Streetarticle.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) declined 0.5% or 107.04 points, to close at 19,864.09, with 22 of the 30 blue-chip companies closing lower. The S&P 500 fell 0.1% to close at 2,278.87, with six of the 11 main sectors finishing in negative territory. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 5,614.79, gaining a meagre 0.02%. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) declined 1.7% to settle at 11.68. A total of around 4.08 billion shares were traded on the NYSE on Tuesday.Political Concern WeighsMarket bulls argue that Trump's business-friendly policy focused on tax cuts, deregulation and infrastructure spending, remains a positive for the economy, but, investors were put to notice on Tuesday that the path higher might no longer be so smooth.Investors' grappled over Trump's executive order to tighten immigration rules. The order would temporarily ban immigration into the U.S. from Iraqi, Syrian, Iranian, Sudanese, Libyan, Somali and Yemeni citizens, while it also seeks ""extreme vetting"" procedures for those it did allow to enter the U.S. Such an executive order spawned legal challenges, congressional criticism and widespread protests.The market rally that catapulted the Dow over 20000 last week has stalled, with investors backing away from shares of industrial and financial companies and picking up havens like gold.

Apple, Inc. Can Still Set Records;2/1/2017;"Image source: Apple.It's been a while sinceApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) posted a bona fide blowout quarter, but I think   it's safe to say that last quarter qualifies.makeArticleAd();The Mac maker set an all-time record high with quarterly   revenue, which came in at $78.4 billion. That's a few billion   higher than the $75.9 billion in sales that Apple generated a   year ago, and above the high end of Apple's own guidance ($78   billion). Naturally, that was driven by strong iPhone sales,   another record at 78.3 million. This all comes as the iPhone 7   was arguably the most incremental model update in years, keeping   the same overall industrial design with no clear must-have   feature. Combined with the perennial supply constraints, it's   rather impressive that the company was able to move that many   smartphones.Other quarterly records set in Q4 were earnings per share   ($3.36), services revenue ($7.2 billion), Mac revenue ($7.2   billion), Apple Watch units (who knows?!), and Apple Watch   revenue (your guess is as good as mine). Four out of Apple's five   geographical operating segments also set fresh highs (all but   Greater China). That's what I call comprehensive performance.Two cameras are better than oneAs usual, the iPhone was the star of the show, comprising   nearly 70% of sales. While sales were up 5%, sell-through was up   8% thanks to robust demand. In line with CFO Luca Maestri'sprediction in October, average selling prices (ASPs) bounced back sequentially with a   vengeance. ASPs were depressed for a few quarters in 2016   following the launch of the $400 iPhone SE, but have now   rebounded to $695 -- pretty comparable to last year's $691.Data source: SEC filings. Chart by author. Calendar quarters     shown.This tells investors a few things, some obvious and others   less so. Clearly, the iPhone 7 Plus is a hit, likely due to the   dual-camera system that is the most notable differentiating   feature. On the earnings call, CEO Tim Cook noted that the mix   was skewed toward the Plus models more than in any prior cycle   (this is the third year that Apple has had Plus models with   5.5-inch displays). Cook even acknowledged later in the call that   Apple did not predict iPhone 7 Plus demand very well, which   adversely affected production plans.Additionally, Apple finally increased the entry-level storage   to 32 GB in 2016, at long last addressing an increasingly   prominent customer complaint. The financial risk to that move was   removing the upsell incentive, and the $100 to $200 that goes   with it. If 32 GB of storage is sufficient, a larger proportion   of customers may opt for the base model instead of upgrading; 16   GB has long been woefully insufficient, virtually assuring strong   upgrade activity. The good news is that Apple has maintained a   relatively comparable mix of upgrades, as evidenced by the strong   ASP.Macs and iPadsThe fact that Mac revenue hit a new all-time high shows that   Apple still has tricks up its sleeve. We're talking about a   business that's over 40 years old, after all. The new MacBook   Pros with Touch Bar were significantly constrained during the   quarter, but the related price increase appears to have been able   to help Mac ASPs by quite a bit. Mac ASPs jumped sequentially   from $1,175 to $1,348; this is the first time in nearly three   years that this figure was above $1,300.There wasn't a whole lot of news on the iPad front, in part   because Apple didn't update its tablet lineup in the fall. Apple   sold 13.1 million units, down 19% from a year ago. iPad revenue   fell more than that due to declining ASPs ($423). The more   affordable iPads continue to prove rather popular. Cook said the   company has some exciting things in the pipeline for iPad,   potentially referring to the rumors around other display sizes or   the Apple Pencil 2.Services to $50 billionApple's services business has just officially become a $25   billion business on a trailing-12-month basis. Management   ambitiously hopes todoublethis business within the next four years, targeting $50 billion   in annual revenue in 2020. That's an aggressive goal, but also in   line with the company's efforts to shift investor attention   toward recurring revenue sources.CFO Luca Maestri noted that the App Store continues to be the   main driver of growth, thanks to increased buying activity within   the installed based as well as new users coming to the platform.   The music business, including both downloads and streaming, has   started growing again over the past three quarters. iCloud   storage upsells are also growing ""very quickly,"" as is AppleCare.   Simply put, the plethora of services that Apple offers are all   faring well.Wrapping upShare repurchases came in at $11 billion, which included $5   billion in open market purchases and a $6 billion accelerated   share repurchase (ASR) program. That's the ninth ASR for those   keeping score at home. The company retired 65.3 million shares   during the quarter thanks to these aggressive repurchases, which   contributed to the record EPS due to its accretive effects.That puts cumulative share repurchases at $143.7 billion out   of the current $175 billion authorization. Apple updates its   capital return program every spring, typically alongside its   April earnings release. There's plenty of room to accommodate   Apple's typical level of repurchases, and investors can look   forward to an update next quarter.In terms of fundamentals, the results were a blowout. Investor   reaction, on the other hand, is another topic. Shares jumped over   4% in extended trading, and Apple hasn't traded around $125 since   mid-2015. I still have doubts about Apple enjoying any semblance   of multiple expansion, but the business is as strong as ever.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Forget the Free Burrito, Get Free Money in Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (CMG) Stock;2/1/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsChipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.(NYSE:CMG) is one of those controversial stocks where I have better luck selling lotto tickets than trying to catch swing runs. Last year I wrote several times about how tocreate free income from CMG stock. The October trade yielded over 40% on money risked.makeArticleAd();Source:Mike Mozart Via FlickrThe fundamentals still have not changed for CMG stock. It still has its fans and haters. Those two groups are the opportunity that I see in the Chipotle options market.I have had success selling these perma-bulls and bears losing lotto tickets - meaning I sell risk against both extremes. Since the truth usually lies somewhere in between, the premium I collect from them expires worthless and for maximum gains.Click to EnlargeCurrently, I see technical things I like about CMG stock. I can argue that if it is able to add a few bucks from its current level, it could mount a challenge to $450 per share. But instead of betting on that fact, today I want to sell risk against a level low enough that it should hold through the summer season.It is important to recognize that earnings are coming soon and those can be brutal in the short term.The Top 10 Dow Dividend Stocks for FebruaryIt is even more important to remember that I only sell naked puts if I am willing and able to own the stock at the strike sold.CMG Stock Trade IdeasThe Trade:Sell CMG Jun $315 put. This is a bullish trade for which I collect $3.20 per contract to open. This trade has a 90% theoretical chance of success with a 24% buffer from current price.By selling CMG put, I commit to buying the stock at that price if Chipotle stock falls through it by June. If so then I would have bought the stock at a 25% discount from current levels and where CMG has had strong consolidation during 2011/2012. 23% sounds like a big enough buffer, but earnings reactions are unpredictable, so I have to be realistic in my expectations.Still, selling naked puts is not suited for everyone. I can modify the trade to better fit more conservative risk profiles.The Alternate:Sell CMG Jun $320/$315 credit put spread. This also is a bullish trade, but one that has a finite risk profile. I collect 50 cents per contract to open. This has a 23% buffer from current price. If successful, this trade yields 10% on money risked.Apple Inc.

ADP Private-Sector Jobs Hit 246K, Way Above Estimates;2/1/2017;"Wednesday, February 1, 2017makeArticleAd();Payroll processing giant ADPADPhas released its January private sector jobs report before the bell this morning, posting a far-better-than-expected 246K new jobs for the month. Consensus expectations had been for 164K. December's total was revised downward by 2000 jobs to 151K, which is the range in which the U.S. labor market had been settling prior to this morning's number.The Services group still rules the roost, with 201K new January jobs in the private sector, whereas Goods brought in 46K. Manufacturing and Mining totals, while not incredibly strong, at least have swung to the positive - 15K and 6K, respectively. Healthcare put up a strong 49K, but the top two sectors were in Professional/Business Services at 71K and Trade/Transportation/Utilities at 63K.Good weather in January can likely take some of this credit. Medium-sized companies (between 50-499 employees) brought in the lion's share with 102K, followed by large companies (500+ employees) at 83K, with Small firms (under 50) picking up the remaining 62K. For years, at least seemingly, it had been small-business hiring which had kept the labor market strong. This looks to be shifting.The ADP report serves as somewhat of a forward indicator toward the monthly non-farm payroll results from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), which also includes Government jobs and will be released Friday. However, the analyst consensus for the BLS total is 174K as of now, down considerably from today's private-sector results. Historically, the ADP and BLS numbers don't always gibe in the near-term, but upon revisions in future months they tend to track each other pretty consistently.What some economists predict going forward, though, is a labor market that shows increasing difficulties with filling open job positions. This is part of what it means to have an Unemployment rate at around 4.7%. This results in wage growth picking up, which we've also seen some evidence of lately. So the potential problems with finding employees with the skill-sets to fill certain positions - which may be exacerbated by the Trump administration's rather draconian policies regarding immigration reform, in that immigrants traditionally absorb many jobs on the lower levels of the pay-scale - may manifest in a stagnating labor market going forward.Earnings UpdateAppleAAPLput up Q1 2017 earnings numbers after the bell that were reminiscent of the tech giant's late-era Steve Jobs years, blowing the doors off expectations for iPhone sales in the quarter.

Apple Just Showed the Mac Is Back - What Does It Mean For PCs?;2/1/2017;"Apple's (AAPL) fiscal first-quarter results came in better-than-expected, thanks in part to strong iPhone sales. However, it's the noticeable growth in the Mac unit that has caught investors' eyes.During the period, Applesold5.374 million Macs, generating $7.244 billion in revenue. That’s a 1% year over year increase in units and more importantly, a 7% increase in revenue. It shows that despite all the media criticism about the new MacBook Pro with the TouchBar, Apple’s products are resonating with the market.Drexel Hamilton analyst Brian White said the Mac sales came in well above his 4.74 million unit projection.makeArticleAd();The results helped Apple return to growth, something that's been nipping at the heels of Apple and its investors for some time.Couple this fact, along withstrong fourth-quarter resultsfrom Intel and its Client Computing unit and it looks like PC sales, which have been in decline for so long, are finally returning to some semblance of normalcy.Intel, which reported earnings last week, saw strength from its next-generation Kaby Lake CPUs. Credit Suisse analysts, led by John Pitzer noted, ""[Original design manufacturers] attributed better than expected builds to the introduction of INTC's next-gen Kaby Lake CPUs, VR-ready NBs and MacBooks, and stronger than expected demand at US [original equipment manufacturers].""Research firm Gartner noted fourth-quarter PC shipments totaled 72.6 million, down 3.7% year-over-year. However, Apple's continued push into the enterprise helped it, as there was a refresh in the business community, in addition to strength in the gaming market.For years, the PC market has been in a sharp decline and while Gartner's figures show an industry still in decline, the decline is moderating. With Apple's essentially flat unit growth, that means it's taking market share, as well as profit share, something that bodes well for Apple and its shareholders.Click to see original TweetThe broader PC market is likely never return to the growth of the 1990's, thanks in part to mobile devices. And while strong, the influx of subsets like gaming PCs are too small to boost the overall market.However, with Apple's latest innovations to its Mac lineup (and more tocome, per CEO Tim Cook) and the rise of niche PC markets, the sector is no longer an albatross area for investors."

Alphabet Inc (GOOGL): The Cheapest $800 Stock I Know;2/1/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsDisruption is everywhere.Amazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) disrupts how we shop, whileAirbnbdisrupts where we stay.Tesla Motors Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) disrupts what we drive, andUbereven disruptswhetherwe drive. If a teen with 2 million Instagram followers can disrupt how billion-dollar businesses find customers, the rest of us need to dive in and start swimming … or at least buy the one stock which has its hands in all of the above:Alphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL).makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockSimply put, GOOGL stock is the most innovative, most disruptive and cheapest $800 equity I know.Let me explain.Silicon Valley money manager Michael Moe and his team at GSV Asset Management produce a provocative weekly newsletter dedicated to highlighting where they think the world is going. While doing research for myBullseye Brief, one of their recent pieces got me thinking about innovation in more tangible terms. The team ranked eight global technology companies based on their involvement across 22 cutting-edge categories. Hands down, Alphabet ranks No. 1, capturing 21 of 22.Innovation LeadersCuriously, all eight GSV-highlighted companies have dedicated efforts in the areas of artificial intelligence, big data and cloud services, making these three the Holy Grail of innovation.The first two come as no surprise, as data gathering and analysis are critical to predicting behavior, enabling companies to target consumers accordingly. Web services, which is now the fastest-growing segment for Amazon, is less obvious but nonetheless a clear indicator these innovators want to get bigger by serving as the backbone for other companies.10 Stocks to Buy That Already Make America GreatThis is key, and since Google already commands 49% of the global online advertising market according to Pivotal Research analyst Brian Wieser, I'll bet on GOOGL.MoonshotMuch of Google's innovative efforts happen at its off-site research center called Google X, aka the Moonshot Factory. It's run by a futurist named Astro Teller, and I highly recommend hisTED Talkexplaining how Google X approaches innovation:Identify a problem affecting millions of people.Find or propose a radical solution for solving that problem.Move full speed ahead if there's reason to believe technology for such a radical solution could actually be built.He says Google X people spend most of their time ""breaking things and trying to prove they're wrong"" but believes that's their secret … what makes Googlers different. By ""killing"" more projects than they approve, their success rate rises. Alphabet spent $13.8 billion last year on research and development - the second highest number of any company in the world behind Amazon, and second highest as a percentage of sales among the eight innovation leaders.R&D as % of RevenueAlphabet invests a staggering amount of money to fund R&D, both because it can and because it has to. With three times more online advertising than its next closest competitor, GOOGL is a cash cow.By the same token, it has significant overlap with all seven competitors in the most obvious categories - like robotics and AI- and each of these companies is hungry to dominate.There's no letting up in this crowd. Innovate or die.What's GOOGL Stock Worth?Ultimately, the question is value: What do we pay?I like to compare the growth we're getting (earnings) with the price we're paying (price-to-earnings, or P/E). This is called a price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG), and it's an intuitive way to compare apples to apples.Using 2017 consensus estimates tracked by Bloomberg, GOOGL stock is tucked right in the middle of the pack. Its PEG ratio is 1.08. PEGs below 1 are cheap, and PEGs approaching 2 are expensive.PEG ratios are revealing.First of all, no one should buyMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT). It's neither a growth stock nor a value play.Alibaba Group Holding Ltd(NYSE:BABA) is a tad expensive, but not excessively so, especially since many consider ittheChinese consumer trading vehicle.Amazon is attractive, so areApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) andFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB), both of which I have written up as longs and currently own.Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Has a New Hero: Services!Samsung(OTCMKTS:SSNLF), I admit is a mystery. It'ssocheap. I can only surmise its limited German and S. Korean listings deter U.S. investors, as does the $1,700 stock price. It needs to split at least 10-to-1.The TradeSell the GOOGL April $800 puts at $20 to initiate a long-biased position.If the stock pulls back and trades through the $800 strike price, I'm assigned shares and become a buyer. If Google continues making new highs, I pocket the premium. I am content either way. Google's chart indicates initial technical support around $780, and significant long-term support $700-$725.The reason I'm selling puts rather than buying the stock is because GOOGL stock has recently risen to a new all-time high. I know new highs tend to beget new highs (momentum traders buy strength), but I'm a value buyer at heart.Adam Johnson is Founder and Author ofBullseye Brief, an investment newsletter that presents thematic and actionable ideas.

(NASDAQ:AAPL-Free Report) put an old-school beat-down on Q1 2017 estimates from the Zacks consensus: $3.36 per share on sales of $78.4 billion easily topped the #3.22 per share and $76.93 billion expected. iPhone sales totaled 78.3 million in the quarter, ahead of the 77.3 million in the company's unit guidance. Gross margins came in-line with expectations at 38.5%.Importantly, the company has finally ended its string of decreasing revenue and unit growth. Apple clearly benefited in the quarter from difficulties Samsung had with its Note 7 release, and Apple CEO Tim Cook announced that iPhone sales picked up more Android switchers than ever before. iPad sales were shy of projections where Mac sales came roughly in-line.For more information on Apple's earnings results, click here.Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA-Free Report) posted a relatively confusing Q1 earnings report on the bottom line, as changes to the company's earnings accounting have made it difficult to make an apples-to-apples comparison.

Earnings of 12 cents per share on quarterly sales of$2.97 billion beat the Zacks consensus estimates of 11 cents and $2.92 billion in revenues.

Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Has a New Hero: Services!;2/1/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) reported its fiscal first-quarter earnings on Tuesday after the bell, and it kicked the year off the right way. Apple set an all-time quarterly revenue record - snapping its streak of declines - and broke its previous iPhone sales record. AAPL stock is up strongly Wednesday morning as a result.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');Source: AppleBut the star of yesterday's show wasn't the iPhone. It was the Services division, which includes the App Store, Apple Pay, iTunes, AppleCare and Apple Music. Services didn't just set another record - it also posted the strongest year-over-year growth of any AAPL division.Services Is on Fire, Led by the App StoreApple reported that the quarterly revenue for its Services division topped $7.17 billion for Q1, an increase of 18% compared to the previous year. If that sounds like a lot of money for what is largely made up of mobile payment transaction fees and digital content, it is. In comparison,Netflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX) experienced its largest-ever subscriber growth in the final quarter of 2016, leading it to post revenue of $2.48 billion.During the AAPL earnings conference call, CEO Tim Cook noted that he expects the Services division to bethe size of a Fortune 100 company by the end of the year. Other key information about the Services division from that earnings call includes:App Store revenue for December alone was a record-setting $3 billionThere are now 2.2 million apps in the App Store, and AAPL paid out over $20 billion to developers in 2016The number of Apple Pay users has tripled over the past year, with transaction volume up over 500% year-over-yearAppleCare and storage services (iCloud) both set all-time recordsApple's music business grew for the third straight quarterWhy Services Revenue is ImportantYou might not know it based on Apple's record-setting iPhone sales this quarter, but selling hardware is tough.The Top 10 Dow Dividend Stocks for FebruaryOnce a consumer has an iPhone in his or her hands, it becomes very difficult to convince them to spend a minimum $649 to ditch that smartphone for a new one. In one sense, a huge installed user base - which AAPL has, withmore than 1 billion iOS devices in active use- works against the company. When the iPhone first began to take off, AAPL was selling to people who'd never owned one before. Now, that pool of easy sales is dwindling. And Apple is left in the tougher position of convincing its installed user base to upgrade.Thus the hand-wringing about slowing iPhone sales.Apple's Services division largely benefits from that huge installed user base, though. True, AAPL only gets one shot at selling these customers AppleCare. But once they own an iPhone, iPad, iPod, Mac, Apple Watch or AppleTV, they begin to explore Apple's other services. They are increasingly adopting Apple Pay. They are in a prime position to buy movies on their Apple TV. They are perfect candidates to subscribe to Apple Music. There are plenty of hooks for storing data on iCloud. And of course, there is the App Store and the lure of its millions of apps.Apple's Services revenue doesn't come in big chunks like selling an iPhone. It's $9.99 a month here, 99 cents for an app there, a few cents for a transaction. But it adds up, especially when over a billion customers are generating it.More importantly, that revenue doesn't drop off the same way hardware revenue does when people stop buying new iPhones.Some services - like iCloud and Apple Music - are subscription-based. AAPL keeps automatically billing the customer's card every month regardless of whether their iPhone is brand new or five years old. Apple Pay revenues are increasing as more countries and businesses accept it and iPhone owners grow more accustomed to using it.Bottom Line for AAPLPeople never stop buying apps. They may slow down after the initial rush of a new device, but developers keep bring enticing new games and other apps to the App Store. That means the 1 billion users continue to download.Trade of the Day: Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock No Longer a Home RunJust look at the 40 million-plusSuper Mario Rundownloads from the App Storein only four days.How many iPhones will AAPL sell two years from now? No one knows for sure, but odds are it won't be many more than it does now. On the other hand, Apple is confident its highflying App Store, Apple Pay and other services will see Services division revenue double in that time.The iPhone may have driven Apple stock growth over the past decade. But Services revenue is increasingly important as AAPL stock searches for that elusive next hardware hit.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 Stocks to Buy That Already Make America GreatCan Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Jump Over These Hurdles?The Only 3 Vanguard Funds You Need to Build a PortfolioThe postApple Inc.

TheS&P 500 Indexfell 0.1%, theDow Jones Industrial Averageposted a 0.5% loss and theNasdaq Compositegained a fraction of a percentage.makeArticleAd();Several companies reported their quarterly earnings data Tuesday, includingApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL),Electronic Arts Inc.(NASDAQ:EA) andMatch Group Inc(NASDAQ:MTCH).Here's what you should know:Apple Inc.

The figure marked a 3.3% rise year-over-year.The Top 10 Dow Dividend Stocks for FebruaryThe strong statistic was fueled in part by Apple's iPhone 7 sales, which were especially strong, topping the total from the previous month. The company sold 78.29 million iPhones in its fourth quarter.The figure was nearly 5% higher than the previous year, or about 4 million more than it sold in 2015's fourth quarter. The company's iPhone business makes up about 69% of its revenue for the quarter.iPad sales were weaker for Apple to end fiscal 2016, falling by 22% to $5.5 billion, which suggests that the newer iPad Pro models are not as hot as the company hoped they would be.Mac computers were 7% higher over the same quarter of 2015, amounting to $7.24 billion.AAPL stock boomed 3% after hours.Electronic Arts Inc.

Revenue fromFIFA'sUltimate Team feature was 22% higher year-over-year.Revenue for the current quarter is expected to come in at $1.48 billion, while earnings are slated to be in the range of $1.64 per share.EA shares fell 1.7% after Tuesday's market close.Match Group Inc (MTCH)Match Group shares were lower on the company's fourth-quarter data.In its three months that ended the fiscal year 2016, the company saw revenue rise 19.5% year-over-year to $319.7 million, resulting in earnings of 29 cents per share.Analysts were calling for revenue $320.8 million and 24 cents per share.

Apple, Inc.'s Record Quarter Returns the Company to Growth;2/1/2017;"After market on closed on Tuesday, tech giantApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) put to rest any doubts about the company's ability   to post strong holiday results. Shares moved a few percentage   points higher immediately after the company released its figures   for its Dec. 31-ending first fiscal quarter of 2017. Apple's   revenue and earnings exceeded both management's own forecast for   the quarter and analysts' consensus estimate.Image source: Apple.makeArticleAd();Here's a look at some of the biggest takeaways from the   results.Financial resultsMetricQ1 2017Q1 2016Year-Over-Year ChangeRevenue$78.4 billion$75.9 billion3.3%Earnings per share$3.36$3.282.4%Gross profit margin38.5%$40.1%(160 basis points)Data source: AppleQ1 2017 press release. Table by author.Apple's revenue reached an all-time high of $78.4 billion, up   3.3% from the year-ago quarter and above the company's guidance   for $76 billion to $78 billion. In addition, Apple's EPS of $3.28   easily exceeded the midpoint of its guidance range for about   $3.17.Segment resultsThe iPhone remained crucial to Apple's overall results,   accounting for nearly 70% of total revenue during the quarter.   With a 5% year-over-year increase in iPhone revenue, the product   segment played a key role in Apple's better-than-expected   financial results.But the tech giant's services segment, which accounts for   sales from the App Store, iTunes, Apple Music, iCloud, Apple Pay,   licensing, and other services, was also important. Services   revenue was up 18% year over year, accounting for 9.1% of the   quarter's total results -- up from 8% in the year-ago quarter.   Apple CEO Tim Cook commented specifically on Apple's services   segment performance, saying the growth was ""led by customer   activity on the App Store.""Data source: Apple Q1 2017 press release. Chart by     author.Another bright spot from Apple's segment results was Mac. With   the help of its new MacBook Pro, the segment's revenue increased   7% year over year.However, not all of Apple's product segments were on the rise   during the quarter. Apple's iPad revenue continued its downward   trend, with revenue falling 22% year over year. Other products   revenue, which includes sales of Apple TV, Apple Watch, Beats   products, iPod, and accessories, saw its revenue decline 8% year   over year. But Apple was careful to note in its first-quarter   press release that despite the decline in other products revenue,   Apple Watch revenue hit an all-time high.GuidanceApple also notably said it expects revenue growth to continue   in the company's second quarter -- an important guide,   considering the company reported three straight quarters of   year-over-year revenue declines in fiscal 2016. Apple guided for   second-quarter revenue to be in the range of $51.5 billion to   $53.5 billion, up from $50.6 billion in the year-ago quarter.Looking beyond the financial results for Apple's second   quarter, Cook said the Apple team is ""excited"" about the products   in its pipeline.The strong quarter for the tech giant, along with a nice   return to growth for the current quarter and for expected revenue   in Q2, reinforces the company's ability to drive results for   shareholders even in a post hyper-iPhone-growth era.Cook was pleased with the company's performance: ""Our team   executed extremely well in the face of strong macroeconomic   headwinds. We are very happy with the continued strong growth in   revenue from services, thanks to the incredible strength of the   Apple ecosystem and our growing base of over 1 billion active   devices.""10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology Index (ETF) (IBB) Shows Signs of Hope;2/1/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBiotechnology stocks - as represented by theiShares Nasdaq Biotechnology Index (ETF)(NASDAQ:IBB) - rallied about 2.8% on Tuesday. As a result, the IBB ETF left behind on the daily chart what technical analysts refer to as a bullish outside reversal day.makeArticleAd();The rally came on the back of a meeting with President Donald Trump and several large pharmaceutical CEOs at the White House on Tuesday. While more clarity is needed as to what the Trump administration's exact agenda is for the pharmaceutical space - which includes the world of biotechnology - for the moment, Tuesday's price action in these stocks must be respected.Throughout the presidential campaign, the pharmaceutical sector was an area of focus by the candidates. Stocks within this sector saw plenty of gyrations as a result. While the broader stock market and many sectors pushed to new highs following the election results last November, pharma and biotech stocks largely speaking to this day remain range-bound and have shown relative weakness.IBB ETF ChartsThe best way to illustrate this is by the following ratio chart where I divided the IBB ETF by theS&P 500- as represented by the popularSPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust(NYSEARCA:SPY). Note the clear relative weakness that biotech stocks have shown versus the broader stock market.While the fund showed some relative strength on Tuesday, the series of lower highs thus far remains well intact.Click to EnlargeOn the multiyear weekly chart, we see the choppy sideways range that biotechnology stocks have been in since early 2016.The Top 10 Dow Dividend Stocks for FebruaryFrom this angle - and through the lens of directional longer-term investors - this range should be respected. Because until it resolves in one direction or another, IBB's price action is just pushing this group of stocks sideways.Click to EnlargeThe week isn't yet over, and it's difficult to see this on the multiyear chart, but last week and this week (so far), the IBB is marking the charts with long bullish candles. Intraweek selloffs so far are getting bought. This may be an initial bullish signal worth paying attention to.The area around $265-$270 on the IBB is getting increasingly important as support.On the daily chart, we see that the IBB etf has narrowed its trading range since last fall by making a series of higher lows and lower highs. Of note, however, is the breakaway gap to the upside from last November following the presidential election results.Click to EnlargeWhile the IBB is still trotting sideways, the lower end of the post-election up-gap continues to hold as support.Lastly, let's note the bullish price action from yesterday, Jan. 31. The IBB ETF initially traded lower before quickly snapping higher and closing near the very highs of the day. The daily candle fully engulfed the previous 10 days' worth of price action.Trade of the Day: Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock No Longer a Home RunActive investors could try to play some follow-through buying in the fund. If and when this takes hold, it should be able to push the IBB ETF quickly back toward the $285-$290 area for now.Any major bearish reversal, however, and erasing of Tuesday's rally would be bearish and a sign to get out of bullish trades until the next bullish reversal rears its head.Like what you see?

Apple (AAPL) Q1 Earnings and Revenues Beat, Increase Y/Y;2/1/2017;"makeZacksArticleAd();Shares ofApple Inc.AAPLwere up over 3% in aftermarket trading following better-than-expected first quarter of fiscal 2017 results.Earnings of $3.36 per share and revenues of $78.4 billion easily topped the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.22 and $76.9 billion. On a year-over-year basis, both metrics registered growth of 2.4% and 3.3%.Product DetailsThe good show was driven by impressive sales of Apple's latest smartphone model iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. Performance of Apple's Services business was also impressive.Total iPhone unit sales came in at about 78.3 million, up 5% year over year. Revenues from iPhone also grew 5% from the year-ago quarter to $54.4 billion (69.4% of total revenue).Services, which include revenues from Internet Services, App store, Apple Music, AppleCare, Apple Pay, licensing and other services, surged 18% year over year (with extra one week in the quarter) to nearly $7.2 billion. App Store sales in December alone topped $3 billion. Apple said that it expects Services ""revenues to be the size of a Fortune 100 company this year.""Apple Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseApple Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise|Apple Inc. QuoteManagement also noted that Apple Pay reported transaction volume growth of 500%, buoyed by expansion to markets like Spain, Japan, Russia and New Zealand. At present Apple Pay is available in 13 markets.Apple Mac unit sales were up 1% year over year to approximately 5.4 million, while revenues grew 7% from the prior-year quarter to $7.2 billion.Coming to iPad, Apple sold 13.1 million units in the quarter, down 19% year over year. Revenues of $5.5 billion were down 22% from the prior year quarter.Other products, which include revenues from Apple TV, Apple Watch, Beats products, iPod and Apple-branded and third-party accessories, declined 8% year over year to over $4 billion. Again, there were no data available on Apple Watch sales or its latest product launch, AirPods.Geographical PerformanceDemand for Apple's products improved across most of the geographical regions except greater China. As much as 64% of sales were from the International markets.Americas (the biggest market for Apple) generated revenues of approximately $32 billion in the quarter, up 9% year over year.Europe generated nearly $18.5 billion in revenues, up 3% on a year-over-year basis.Revenues from Japan rose 20% year over year to $5.8 billion while the rest of Asia Pacific generated revenues of $5.8 billion, up 8% year over year.Owing to persistent macroeconomic weakness, Apple revenues declined around 12% year over year in the Greater China region to $16.2 billion.MarginsGross margin was 38.5%, a decline of 160 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter.Operating expenses increased 9% year over year to $6.8 billion due to higher research & development expenses as well as selling, general and administrative expenses. As a result, operating margin plunged 210 bps from the year-ago quarter to 29.8%.Balance Sheet and Cash FlowApple's cash and cash equivalents (and short-term marketable securities) were $60.5 billion at the end of the quarter, compared with $67.2 billion at fiscal 2016-end. Long-term debt was $73.6 billion compared with $75.4 billion at the end of fiscal 2016.For the quarter, cash generated from operating activities was $27.1 billion.Apple returned about $15 billion in capital returns this quarter through dividends and share repurchases. Apple also said that it has so far returned $201 billion out of the $250 billion capital returns program announced in April last year.The company also declared its quarterly dividend of 57 cents per share payable on Feb 16 to shareholders of record as on Feb13.GuidanceFor the second quarter of fiscal 2017, Apple forecasts revenues in a range of $51.5 billion to $53.5 billion.Gross margin is expected within 38% to 39%, while operating expenses are projected within $6.5 billion to $6.6 billion. Other income/ (expense) is likely to be $400 million, while tax rate is expected to be 26%.Our TakeBetter-than-expected iPhone sales have definitely come as a respite. But the macroeconomic headwinds remain for now, especially in China, one of the high-growth regions for Apple.

Despite the shortcomings of the iPhone, yesterday's earnings beat estimates, and according to analyst Therese Poletti ofMarketWatch, the growth was fueled by a return to the iPhone to the exclusion of other products.

The Dow Jones Continues Its Drift From 20,000;1/31/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsU.S. equities continue to move lower on Tuesday as Wall Street sours on the policy implications of the Trump White House, turning from a focus on positives on tax reform to negatives (for big business), such as a clampdown on immigration and ""chaos"" amid a fight with congressional democrats over everything from cabinet picks to executive actions.makeArticleAd();Currency valuations were in focus, with White House trade advisor Peter Navarro telling theFinancial Timesthat the euro was ""grossly undervalued"" in a swipe at German manufacturers.In the end, theDow Jones Industrial Averagelost 0.5%, theS&P 500shed 0.1%, theNasdaq Compositegained a fraction and theRussell 2000finished the day 0.7% lower.Treasury bonds were mostly stronger, gold rallied 1.3%, the dollar weakened after Trump complained of foreign currency devaluations on Twitter (hitting the ""strong dollar"" post-election trade) and crude oil gained 0.3% after giving up earlier strength.

Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Pops Following Vindicating Q1 Earnings;1/31/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) needed a strong showing in its recently completed quarter, in the shadow of three straight quarters of waning revenue and waning earnings. It got it, sending AAPL stock up 2.6% in Tuesday's after-hours trading.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');Source: AppleFor the company's first fiscal quarter ending in December, Apple reported income of $3.36 per share on revenue of $78.4 billion. Both were better than analyst expectations for a profit of $3.22 per share on revenue of $77.42 billion. AAPL posted income of $3.28 per share in the same quarter a year earlier, when it generated $75.87 billion in sales.CEO Tim Cook commented on the results:""We're thrilled to report that our holiday quarter results generated Apple's highest quarterly revenue ever, and broke multiple records along the way. We sold more iPhones than ever before and set all-time revenue records for iPhone, Services, Mac and Apple Watch.""CFO Luca Maestri added:""Our outstanding business performance resulted in a new all-time record for earnings per share, and over $27 billion in operating cash flow. We returned nearly $15 billion to investors through share repurchases and dividends during the quarter, bringing cumulative payments through our capital return program to over $200 billion.""Apple EarningsWhile AAPL stock has been a strong growth machine since unveiling the first iPhone a little over a decade ago, per-share profits have been lower on a year-over-year basisin each of the prior three quarters. The same goes for revenue. Q1's numbers largely rekindle confidence in the company's prospects.Almost as important as Apple's top and bottom lines for the first fiscal quarter of the year was the number of iPhones it sold during the accounting period in question.The Top 10 Dow Dividend Stocks for FebruaryBroadly speaking, the pace of sales growth of the iPhone has been slowing as saturation and better competition chip away at Apple's prowess in the market. TheiPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus were released in September, before the end of the previous quarter.The bulk of the device's sales, though, came in the subsequent quarter beginning in October. During that three-month span, the company sold 78.2 million of the smartphone ($58.4 billion worth of the device), versus expectations of 77.3 million. The company didn't indicate how many of those were iPhone 7 phones, but Cowen & Co. had forecast 58.5 million iPhone 7's were sold during fiscal Q1.The company's fast-growing digital product arm - music, video and apps - drove respectable revenue during the quarter as well.Digital content as a revenue source had not been a priority for AAPL until sales of Macs, iPhones and iPads began to slow down last year. The companyturned up the heat on this line last year, however, and has turned the unit into Apple's second-biggest piece of revenue pie. Last quarter it contributed $7.17 billion worth of sales, up 18% from year-ago levels, and accounting for 9% of total sales. Analysts had only expected $7.07 billion worth of services revenue.Apple is evenmulling the creation of its own original television shows and movies, following in the footsteps of on-demand video rivalsNetflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX) andAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN).Geographically, the Americas continue to provide the bulk of Apple's revenue, though China and its neighbors provided the majority of revenuegrowthlast quarter.The Americas accounted for $31.9 billion in Apple's sales last quarter, up 58%. China put $16.2 billion worth of revenue on the table, up 85% year-over-year. Japan and the rest of the Asia-Pacific area only contributed $5.9 billion in sales, but that tally was up 119% versus the tally from the same quarter a year earlier.Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD): The Turnaround Is Legit!The future of Apple's business in China hangs in the balance. President Donald Trump's policy plans are said by some to be the beginning of a trade war.Not only would that make iPhones more difficult to sell in China, but would strain Apple's relationships with key manufacturers of iPhone, iPad and Mac components.Bottom Line for AAPL StockLooking ahead, Apple anticipates revenue of between $51.5 billion and $53.5 billion for the quarter currently underway. The company doesn't provide earnings guidance, but as of the latest look, the pros collectively believe Apple will earn $2.09 per share of Apple stock on revenue of $53.94 billion.Both figures are higher than year-ago comparisons, and those estimates may well be adjusted higher before the second quarter numbers are posted.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceThe 10 Best Stocks to Buy for 2017: The Experts' PicksThe Only 3 Vanguard Funds You Need to Build a PortfolioThe 10 Best Index Funds for 2017, 2018, 2019 ...The postApple Inc.

3 ETFs For True Total Market Coverage;1/31/2017;"ETF investors often spend an inordinate amount of time trying to find the best spot in the market.  They love focusing on specific sectors, factors, or tactical strategies that are showing a promising edge.  However, there is often a fundamental need for simple and diversified stock exposure at the lowest possible cost.This type of core foundation is the essence behind total stock market funds.  They allow you to stay correlated with the broadest possible indexes and charge expenses that are so fractional as to be almost non-existent.  They embody the true spirit of the ETF philosophy in their liquidity, tax efficiency, and transparency.The largest and most well-known of this group is theVanguard Total Stock Market ETF(VTI).  Over the years, I’ve lost track of how many awards and commendations this fund has received.  Its true value proposition is the simplicity of a single vehicle for complete U.S. stock market coverage with the lowest possible tracking error.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');VTI owns a basket of 3,592 publicly traded securities across the large, mid, and small-cap verticals.  You can’t get much more diversified than that.  The fund is market-cap weighted to give the largest stocks a greater share of its $70 billion asset base.  Nevertheless, the top holding,Apple Inc(AAPL) only accounts for 2.5% of the total portfolio.  That leaves a large swath of exposure to be distributed through the thousands of remaining holdings.One of the highly touted advantages of VTI is its ultra-low expense ratio of 0.05%.  That’s just $50 for every $100,000 invested on an annual basis.  The minimal expenses ensure this fund is appropriate as a long-term position in virtually any type of equity portfolio.The next largest fund by size is theSchwab US Broad Market ETF(SCHB), which has $7.7 billion under management.  This ETF tracks a basket of 2,000 stocks domiciled in the U.S. through all market-cap segments.SCHB claims one of the lowest industry expense ratios at just 0.03% annually.  This fee has been incrementally lowered multiple times over the years, which adds to its attractiveness for long-term investors.  It’s even conceivable that one day this ETF will charge as low as one basis point per year for access to its diversified stock portfolio.Last, but certainly not least, is theiShares Core S&P Total U.S. Stock Market ETF(ITOT).  This fund shares traits of both VTI and SCHB in its overall makeup.  It charges an expense ratio of 0.03% and contains more than 3,600 underlying holdings.  ITOT has $6.7 billion in assets under management and has been in place since 2004.While all three of these funds have minor differences in their structure, they must ultimately be judged on their results. The 5-year price chart below shows that the returns for all three are almost indistinguishable from each other.That level of correlation is a dependable statistic for those that are agonizing over which is the best fund to pick.  There really is no wrong answer here.  Although, the decision may be made easier if one of these options is available transaction-free from your brokerage platform.  That would truly minimize total costs and allow you to scale in or out of any shares with the lowest possible friction.The Bottom LineTotal market ETFs are solid tools for both experienced investors and those who are just starting out on this journey.

Intel Corporation Gets an Apple Inc. iPhone 7 Boost;1/31/2017;"Finally, microprocessor giantIntel(NASDAQ: INTC) has managed to achieve a real degree of success in   the market for chips that go into smartphones. A while back, it   was revealed thatApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) had chosen to use Intel as a second source for the   LTE modems that power its iPhone.Apple's iPhone SE. Image source: Apple.makeArticleAd();Now, while some investors may have worried that Intel might be   ""giving away"" these cellular modems -- in a move similar to what   the company did with its Bay Trail tablet processors (i.e.   providing platform cost offsets valued more than the selling   prices of the chips) -- the company's most recent financial   results show that this is very clearly not the case.The big modem boostIntel's modem sales fall under its Client Computing Group   (CCG), which derives the bulk of its revenue from sales of   processors and other components that go into personal   computers. When Intel reports financial results for CCG, it   gives investors two numbers to chew on: platform revenue and   ""other"" revenue. Platform revenue is made up of processor and   accompanying chipset (also known as a PCH) sales, while ""other""   revenue refers to a smorgasbord of other complementary   technologies, including cellular modems.We can see that Intel is seeing a very large boost in cellular   modem sales because Intel's revenue from ""other"" went from $356   million in the fourth quarter of 2015 -- when Intel sold   precisely zero modems to Apple -- to $773 million in the fourth   quarter of 2016 -- when Intel is known to be selling modems to   Apple.Of course, it's likely that not all of that increase is due to   the ramp up in cellular modem shipments -- Intel did take the   time to highlight that it enjoyed record Wi-Fi chip shipments   last quarter -- but there's really nothing else that can explain   the substantial majority of that increase.What does this revenue increase tell us?The bad news is that we can't deduce too much about the   profitability of these modems solely from these results -- though   Intel did indicate later in the call that cellular modem   shipments during 2017 would serve as a headwind to the company's   gross profit margins. So we know that the modems are sold at   lower than corporate average margins.What we can deduce is this, however: Intel isn't providing   excessive ""contra-revenue"" payments to get these modems into the   iPhone because Intel is generating positive revenue -- and   significant revenue at that -- from its modems. (Although we   already knew this because Intel would almost have certainly   disclosed to investors in advance that a ramp of its modem   shipments would detract from operating profit.) If that were the   case, some investors may have wanted to see the financial   evidence before believing it.Looking aheadIf we assume that Intel is going to continue to supply Apple   with modems beyond the iPhone 7 -- and the odds of this look good   -- then there are some interesting financial   implications. First, Intel's share at Apple may be set to   grow in the coming product cycle. Right now, Intel is in some   portion of the iPhone 7 models, but is completely absent from the   iPhone SE, iPhone 6s, or iPhone 6s.Once Apple releases new models and waterfalls the iPhone 7 and   iPhone 7 Plus to serve as its mid-range offerings -- and if we   assume that Intel and Qualcomm get roughly equivalent order   allocations during the next iPhone cycle to what we're seeing   with the iPhone 7 series -- then Intel's share will necessarily   go up. I also wouldn't be surprised to see Intel inside of a   future iPhone SE, as well.It's reasonable to expect that Intel will see some nice   year-over-year growth in the ""other"" portion of CCG over the   course of 2017, with acceleration happening in the second half of   the year, due to the launch of the new iPhone models.10 stocks we like better than Wal-MartWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock     tip, it can pay to listen.

Is Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Resurrecting the Cursed Windows RT?;1/31/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsDon't look now, butMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) looks to be taking another run atAlphabet Inc's(NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) Chrome operating system. References have begun popping up in builds of the Windows 10 Creators Update (which is due to arrive in April) to Windows 10 Cloud.makeArticleAd();Source: MicrosoftSpeculation is growing that Windows 10 Cloud is in fact a new simplified version of Microsoft's operating system, designed to run on devices powered by inexpensive ARM chips fromARM Holdings plc (ADR)(NASDAQ:ARMH).In other words, it appears that Microsoft is preparing to take on the threat of Chromebooks - the cheap, popular laptops running Google's Chrome OS. And it seems to be doing so by resurrecting the idea of Windows RT.Windows 10 CloudWindows 10 Creators Build is the next major revision of the Microsoft Windows PC operating system. It's due to begin rolling out to users around April 17.The 5 Best Stocks to Buy for Big Emerging Markets ProfitsBut developers have been testing pre-release builds of Microsoft's software and recently some of them began to notice something strange: The code references different variations of the operating system. For example, Windows 10 Pro for Workstation and Windows 10 for Enterprise are spiked out. Nothing unusual there. But then, references to Windows 10 Cloud began to appear. And that started raising eyebrows - what is Windows 10 Cloud?ZDNet'sMary Jo Foley put the pieces together yesterday. Quoting unnamed sources, she says that the mysterious Windows 10 Cloud is a new, simplified version of Microsoft Windows that will run only Unified Windows Platform (UWP) apps. In other words, it's a""simpler, safer, cheaper"" version of Windows 10.You might also think of it as another crack at Windows RT …Windows RT? But Why?Everyone remembers the mess that wasWindows RT. The attempt to shoehorn a version of Windows onto a consumer tablet running ARM chips -the ill-fated Surface RT - very nearly dealt MSFT's tablet aspirations a fatal blow.However, despite the failure of Windows RT, Microsoft has never given up on the idea of Windows on ARM chips. By doing so, it can get Windows onto mobile devices that can't use the more powerful and expensive chips fromIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC). The company has already been showing offWindows 10 running in emulation on high-end ARM chips. As part of that effort, it could also be working on a ""lite"" version that can deliver much of the Windows 10 experience on less expensive, lower powered ARM hardware.So why, why,whywould Microsoft risk falling flat on its face again with what essentially amounts to another crack at Windows RT? There are two reasons.The first is that dream of ""Windows everywhere."" Having the full Windows 10 experience on high-powered ARM chips is great, but only flagship smartphones and tablets can afford to use those chips. Windows 10 Cloud would get Microsoft Windows (and Bing) onto a whole lot more mobile hardware.The second is Google's Chrome OS and Chromebooks. These cheap laptops have been under Microsoft's skin for years. They've become extremely popular in the education sector thanks to low cost, ease of use and built-in security. And Chromebooks have just kept selling, to the point where last year they passed evenApple Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AAPL)MacBooks in sales.Microsoft has tried fighting back by helping manufacturers put out cheap Windows 10 laptops, but that hasn't stemmed the Chromebook flood. Windows 10 makes for a sluggish experience on inexpensive Intel hardware, it's far more complex than Chrome OS to use and lacks the drop-dead easy security of Chromebooks.Cash Out of Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Before EarningsWindows 10 Cloud running on laptops with ARM processors would compete head-to-head with Chromebooks running Chrome OS: simpler, safer and cheaper than Windows 10.Microsoft refused to comment on theZDNetpost, but the pieces pointing to Windows 10 as a Chrome OS-fighting, second crack at Windows RT make sense. Naturally, MSFT is going to avoid all references to Windows RT - that's poison - and the Windows 10 Cloud name could end up being a code name.It could also be an attempt to steal some of the Chrome OS ""cloud"" thunder. Expect to get the final answer on Windows 10 Cloud from Microsoft prior to that April 17 Windows 10 Creators Build release.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace3 ""Golden"" Ammo Stocks to Buy for Big 2017 Returns3 Stocks to Buy for Better Deals Than the Great RecessionThe postIs Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Resurrecting the Cursed Windows RT?appeared first onInvestorPlace."

Intel Corporation's Personal-Computer Business Beats Expectations;1/31/2017;"On Jan. 26, microprocessor giantIntel(NASDAQ: INTC) announced its financial results for the fourth   quarter of 2016 and, by extension, the entirety of 2016.A rendering of an Intel seventh-generation Core processor.     Image source: Intel.makeArticleAd();The company had previously guided to $15.7 billion in revenue   for the quarter and gross profit margin of 61%, representing   sequential declines from $15.8 billion and 63.3%,   respectively.Intel's actual financial results were much more impressive;   the company reported $16.4 billion in revenue for the quarter and   a gross profit margin percentage of 61.7%, up from $14.9 billion   and down from 64.3% in the prior year, respectively.For the full year, Intel raked in $59.4 billion at 60.9% gross   profit margin -- a little above the midpoint of its long-term   gross margin range of 55% to 65%, though down 170 basis points   year over year.This upside appears to have been driven, ironically enough, by   the company's Client Computing Group (CCG) business, which   derives the bulk of its revenues from sales of components into   personal computers, generally viewed as a declining market.Let's take a closer look at the company's revenue and profit   performance in this segment.Solid improvements in revenue and     profitabilityIntel reported that total CCG revenue hit $9.13 billion in the   most recent quarter, up from $8.76 billion in the same quarter a   year-ago -- a respectable 4% year-over-year boost.Operating income vastly outpaced revenue, though, with this   figure growing from $2.72 billion in the year-ago quarter to   $3.52 billion in the most recent quarter -- up almost 30% year   over year. Management attributed this to lower operating   expenses, a ""richer product mix,"" and improved product margins as   14-nanometer chip manufacturing yields improved. The same story   has been playing out all year in CCG.Now, it's worth noting that Intel reported that the ""platform""   portion of its CCG revenue, which consists of sales of processors   and chipsets, were roughly flat, at $8.36 billion in the prior   year compared with $8.4 billion in the most recent quarter. But   its ""other"" segment -- which includes complementary products,   such as wireless chips -- saw revenues more than double to $773   million, from $356 million a year-ago.It is likely that this large boost in ""other"" revenue within   CCG was due primarily to the ramp-up of the company's XMM 7360   cellular modem in theApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus devices.Good full-year resultsFor the full year, Intel reported that CCG revenue was up 2%,   while expectations going into the year were for a decline, with   operating profit up a smidgen more than 30%. Platform revenue was   roughly flat, at $30.75 billion versus $30.68 billion, with   ""other"" revenue surging from $1.54 billion in 2015 to $2.16   billion in 2016.The iPhone win clearly contributed to a large part of the   ""other"" segment growth here, but the driver of the increased   platform revenue is a little bit subtler.Indeed, Intel reported that shipments of its notebook computer   processors declined by 1% year over year and that shipments of   its desktop computer processors dropped by 6%. Key to keeping   platform revenues flat was a 2% increase in notebook platform   average selling prices, as well as a 2% increase in desktop   platform average selling prices.What's happening, then, is that computer makers are selling   fewer computers than they were before, as evidenced by the   notebook and desktop platform unit shipment drops, but the   computers that they do sell, on average, contain more expensive   processors.10 stocks we like better than IntelWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

The social networking app maker   posted eye-popping numbers last quarter -- 32% annual growth in   monthly active users (MAUs), 20% growth in total revenues, and   30% non-GAAP earnings growth.Analysts expect MeetMe's revenue and non-GAAP earnings to   respectively rise 38% and 16% next year. Yet the stock trades at   just 7 times trailing earnings and 10 times forward earnings.   Let's take a look at the five key reasons investors aren't buying   MeetMe's growth story, despite its high growth figures and low   valuations.MeetMe's mobile app. Image source: Google Play.makeArticleAd();1. A troubling history with sexual predatorsMeetMe lets users find new people in their area to chat with,   similar toMatch's(NASDAQ: MTCH) Tinder. While there's nothing inherently   sinister about the app, there have been multiple reports of   MeetMe being used by sexual predators.In 2014, the City of San Francisco sued MeetMe for the   unlawful publication of minors' profiles, photos, and geolocation   data, and claimed that  the app ""enabled"" sexual predators   to find their victims. The city cited several cases involving   adult men and minors in which MeetMe was used. MeetMe settled the   case for $200,000 the  following year, agreeing to clarify   and simplify its user agreements and settings, and reducing the   amount of data displayed on minors to their city and state.But the cases involving MeetMe didn't cease -- last February,   a Buffalo man was  charged with multiple counts of child   pornography after using MeetMe to find minors. MeetMe's troubles   raised red flags at Tinder, which hiked its age limit from 13 to   18 last June. Yet MeetMe still hasn't followed suit, presumably   because it would lose a large portion of its users.2. The potential loss of ad revenuesYou'd think that big companies would be reluctant to advertise   on MeetMe, but plenty of big brands still advertise on the app.   That's because MeetMe generates most of its ad revenues from   programmatic ads delivered byTwitter's(NYSE:TWTR) MoPub.This means that MoPub's customers simply pick a demographic --   in MeetMe's case, younger users and Millennials -- and the   platform feeds the ads to various apps. This means that many   companies probably don't realize that their ads are appearing on   MeetMe.Therefore, a common bear thesis is that MoPub could decide to   drop MeetMe due to violations of its terms of service, or   advertisers could ask MoPub to pull their ads from the   controversial app. There's no evidence either of these scenarios   will occur, but it raises a troubling question -- if MeetMe's   reputation worsens, can it still keep growing its ad   revenues?3. Being booted from the app storesIn its 10-K filing for fiscal 2015, MeetMe admits  that   its business will suffer if it is ""unable to maintain a good   relationship"" withAppleandAlphabet's Google. It notes that its app could be pulled from their app   stores ""if we violate"" or the companies believe ""that we have   violated"" their terms and conditions.The bulls might believe that's just a typical ""risk factor""   warning, but MeetMe admits in the same filing that ""on more than   one occasion,"" Apple rejected its app ""because of user generated   content and other concerns."" This indicates that another   high-profile lawsuit could knock MeetMe out of the app stores and   kill its business.4. Tinder is crushing MeetMeMeetMe arrived before Tinder, which was initially launched in   2012. But over the past five years, mainstream interest in MeetMe   waned in correlation with Tinder's growth, as seen in this chart   from Google Trends:Image source: Google.That decline also explains why MeetMe acquired its competitor   Skout last  October. That move boosted the company's MAU   count from about 5 million to  8.5 million, and greatly   inflated MeetMe's top and bottom line growth for fiscal 2016.5. The lack of insider confidenceIf MeetMe is as undervalued as the fundamentals suggest, you'd   expect insiders to be loading up on shares. However, MeetMe CEO   Geoffrey Cook just  sold 250,000 shares (16% of his entire   position) at an average price of $5.02.Including Cook's sales, insiders sold  1.96 million   shares over the past 12 months, but only bought 334,000 shares.   It's understandable that MeetMe's insiders would sell after the   stock's 50% rally over the past 12 months, but it also indicates   that its upside potential could be limited.The key takeawayThe main lesson here is to always look beyond the valuations   and growth forecasts. On the surface, MeetMe looks like a rapidly   growing social app maker trading at a discount to its peers. But   dig deeper, and you'll see an app that's struggling to prove that   it's not a tool for criminals while remaining relevant against   Tinder, which dominates the space with  over 50 million   active users.10 stocks we like better than MeetMeWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Trade War Concerns Coming Home to Roost;1/31/2017;"Tuesday, January 31, 2017makeArticleAd();We'd gone more than two months on a Trump Rally that had favorably priced in things like corporate tax cuts and deregulation, opening a clear path toward market gains. Eventually we saw a bid up to the coveted Dow 20,000 - something that had been considered a pipe dream so soon by a plurality of analysts.This morning, however, based on a CNBC survey among economists, protectionist policies of the Trump administration are considered the biggest threat to the U.S. economy. A border adjustment tax is receiving a 45% negative rating from the analysts surveyed - especially regarding two of America's biggest trading partners, China and Mexico - as a trade war scenario begins to emerge.Especially now that we have seen aggressive actions from the nascent administration that, if transferred to candidate Trump's promises on trade, look to radicalize the status quo. This is something the markets had not priced in, but are beginning to do so. Dow 20,000 is now in the rearview mirror - down another 43 points from closing yesterday below the psychologically pleasing 20K round number.Q4 earnings results have also taken a down-turn ahead of the opening bell today: ExxonMobilXOM, Under ArmourUAAand PfizerPFEall reported disappointing results on the bottom line this morning. Under Armour in particular has been hard hit in the pre-market, down initially 28% (now around 24%) on the news, which also included a report that its CFO will be stepping down.After the bell today we'll see AppleAAPLreport earnings results. Estimates of $3.22 per share on $76.2 billion represent a mixed bag from the year-ago quarter, down 6 cents per share but narrowly above Q1 2016 sales totals. The stock is up more than 9% since the Trump Rally began, outperforming the S&P 500 overall.Mark VickerySenior EditorClick here to follow this author>>Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Why Expedia Inc Will Profit From This Global Market Trend (EXPE);1/31/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAs an analyst who spends every day looking at numbers, I have a tendency to try and quantify everything. We humans, as a species, tend to do this all the time.makeArticleAd();For the most part, it serves us well. But it can also sometimes be a trap, diminishing the value of what is simply unquantifiable.I learned this lesson a few years ago on a trip to the green highlands and snow-capped mountains of Peru.During the planning phase, I contemplated every detail of the trip, from number of hours spent on flights… nights spent in hotels… how many sites I could see within a certain amount of time. Everything had to be just perfect.But even during the early phases of the journey, I found myself counting…There were four grueling days of hiking. At about 20.5 miles in total length, it took four days to complete. Each night, we camped at about 13,000 feet. And at the summit of our hike, we would reach 14,928 feet.Strenuous hiking at such a high elevation for such an extended period of time meant that every breath, every step, was a laborious effort. But we pressed on, young and old, encouraged each other and offered a helping hand until we reached the end of our journey. And best of all, we knew that each painstaking step meant that we were just that closer to seeing one of the most truly remarkable sights in the world: the ancient Incan city of Machu Picchu.It was only during those little moments when I was able to move past this tendency to quantify everything that I truly lost myself in the mystery and wonder the world has to offer.Hopefully, you've had the chance to have experiences like this at some point in your life, too. All too often, we in the developed world tend to take for granted the fact that most of us have the means to do these kinds of things.7 Stocks to Buy That Could Double by 2018But there are hundreds of millions of people who don't - but they soon will.The World's Burgeoning Middle ClassGlobal demand for travel is surging. Hundreds of millions of people are entering the global middle class right now and in the years to come. One of the first things these people will look to do is travel.By 2030, two-thirds of the global middle class will be residents of the Asia-Pacific region. That's up from just under one-third in 2009. And China alone is expected to have a staggering one billion members of the middle class by then.China's budding middle class is already traveling in greater numbers than ever before. A United Nations tourism report showed that the number of Chinese citizens traveling overseas has surged from 10 million in 2000 to more than 83 million in 2013.This is a huge opportunity for the online travel business. Consumers in the Asia-Pacific region currently book only about 27% of their travels online, while Latin America lags even further at 21%. In China, only about 15% of consumers currently book their travel online. This is compared to rates over 50% in the United States and Europe.It's not hard to imagine that the rest of the world will quickly catch up to the United States and Europe in terms of booking their travel online. And that sets up a tremendous opportunity.That's where my colleague Jimmy Butts comes in with one of his most recent picks in his premium newsletter,Top Stock Advisor…How To Profit From This TrendIn last month's issue of his newsletter, Jimmy reported on the incredible growth of the online travel market. Citing much of the information I referenced above, he went on to recommend two publicly-traded online travel companies.I don't like to make a habit of giving away too many picks from our premium publications, since our subscribers pay good money for this information (to learn how to subscribe,go here). But I can reveal that one of them isExpedia Inc(EXPE), the world's largest online travel company.Surging industry growth is reflected in Expedia's gross bookings. In 2015, the company booked a staggering $60 billion worth of flights, hotels, rental cars and cruises. It's on track to crush those figures in 2016, already racking up gross bookings of more than $56 billion through the first nine months of this year, which is 23% more compared with the first nine months of 2015.Expedia has made major strides in the international market. In 2005, international revenue made up only 22% of its portfolio; last year that soared to approximately 45%. But that's just the tip of the iceberg in terms of potential for growth. Despite being the largest player in online travel, the company still has only a 4% share of the global market.This speaks to the highly-fragmented nature of the market, but also for the potential to grow through acquisitions, which Expedia has been doing for some time now already. Between the growth in the global middle class and growth in the online travel market, Jimmy thinks Expedia should benefit greatly over the next 5-10 years.As such, it's a good long-term holding to consider adding to your portfolio.3 Things Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Owners Must Watch in Q1 EarningsJimmy's other pick, however, may have even more potential. I won't give away the name here (to get it, you'll have to subscribe toTop Stock Advisor.) But it has a hold on 50% of the online travel market in China - which by all accounts should be the prime growth market in in the years ahead.While the real value of travel may not be quantifiable, investors who back this company now could be counting sizeable gains within a few years.

Why Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM) Q4 Earnings Trump Reality;1/31/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThere was an unusual amount of anticipation over the fourth-quarter earnings release ofExxon Mobil Corporation(NYSE:XOM). After all its CEO, Rex Tillerson, was recently plucked from the boardroom and made U.S. Secretary of State. There is hope that oil and gas prices may stay over $50 per barrel and, if so, Exxon stock should be making big money.makeArticleAd();Source:Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified)But it's not … at least not yet. XOM's numbers, $1.7 billion in net income and 41 cents per share, badly trailed analyst estimates of 68 cents. But the top-line, $61 billion in revenue, was about a half-billion above those estimates.For the year, the company earned $7.84 billion, $1.88 per share. This sounds impressive, but it's less than half of 2015's $16.15 billion in earnings, and that in turn was half of 2014's $32.52 billion. The initial response of traders was cautious, with Exxon stock opening only slightly below the previous day's close of $84.86 per share.The question for XOM stock investors remains, is this the bottom, and how quick might the turn be?Exxon Stock Is Hanging In ThereThe year 2016 was a year that XOM stock had to hang in and tough things out. The earnings release emphasized that cash flow and asset sales covered the dividend of 75 cents per share. The dividend costs the company about $3 billion per quarter, and the quarterly earnings continue to come up short of that mark.10 Stocks to Buy That Already Make America GreatThe company has kept earnings positive by cutting back sharply on capital expenditures. It spent $4.83 billion during the fourth quarter, against $7.42 billion a year earlier. For the year, Exxon invested $19.30 billion, against $31.05 billion in 2015.This has yet to have a big impact on production, which was down just 3%, or 127,000 barrels per day, from 2015's figures during the fourth quarter, with new volume in Nigeria and Indonesia partly making up for the declining production of U.S. fields. The company lost $2.3 billion producing oil, which it calls ""upstream"" operations, and $1.2 billion refining and selling it, which it calls ""downstream"" operations. The profit came from chemicals, $872 million, and finance earnings of $209 million.XOM Stock: Swing and a MissInitial reporting on the release emphasized the earnings miss.CNBC said the numbers""badly"" missedestimates on earnings, and Marketwatch just used the word""miss.""The Nasdaq.com headline emphasized that earnings fell 40%from a year earlier.However, writers hedged their stories by noting the strength of Exxon stock and pointing out that the shares were already down nearly 6% for 2017, and after an initial fall of a few cents, XOM stock quickly found its footing in pre-market trading, getting above $85 per share. The yield remains fat at 3.5%, so the downside for Exxon stock will be muted.Better Times Ahead for XOM?It's anticipation of bigger things that keeps Exxon stock players coming back. InvestorPlace Feature Writer James Brumley holds out great hope for a deal, whichtook the Bass family prospects in the Permian Basin back into the fold.XOM stock investors expected an update on Texas productionat the company's earnings conference call.3 Things Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Owners Must Watch in Q1 EarningsDespite the recent fall in the Exxon stock price, the 320-day moving averagehas been rising for over two monthswith speculators saying it needed to hold $84.55 to maintain the up-trend. That seemed likely.Analysts continue to hold their breath on XOM stock, with half now sitting in the ""hold"" camp, one having recently switched off ""strong buy"" and one having switched off ""strong sell.""The bottom line for Exxon stock is that, if Trump is as good for oil as advertised, the company should be seeing that in results as 2017 unfolds. Or that could be a pie-crust promise - easily made, easily broken.Dana Blankenhornis a financial and technology journalist.

Alphabet Employees Protest Against Trump's Immigration Ban;1/31/2017;"Protests against Donald Trump's anti-immigration policy are gaining steam and the technology sector appears to be leading the way.  More than 2000Alphabet Inc.'sGOOGLGoogle employees staged protests against Trump's immigration ban by walking out of eight offices worldwide including the company's headquarters in Mountain View on Monday. Photos and videos of the walkouts have been tweeted using hashtag #GooglersUnite.Google co-founder Sergey Brin and CEO Sundar Pichai have extended their full support to the opposition.Concurrent with the protest, Google created a $4 million fund to support immigrant rights groups like the Immigrant Legal Resource Center, the American Civil Liberties Union, the U.N. Refugee Agency and the International Rescue Committee.The protest was particularly against Trump's executive order to ban nationals of seven Muslim majority countries - Iraq, Iran, Somalia, Libya, Syria, Sudan and Yemen - from coming to the U.S. Pichai denounced the order and stated that the ban affects about 187 Google employees.We note that not quite long ago, Trump had called up technology leaders and urged them to create and retain jobs within the U.S. to which most of them had given their nods. However as the immigration ban order rolled out, the sector is sending clear indications that it will not create jobs at the cost of preventing entry to external talent.Alphabet Inc.

Chief executive officers of MicrosoftMSFT, AppleAAPL, NetflixNFLX, Uber, Airbnb and Tesla Motors have all indicated that they are against the decision.The technology sector recruits a big chunk outside talent and the survival of the sector could be at stake if immigration reduces or stops completely.The sector fears that Trump may overhaul the H1-B program that allows Silicon Valley to bring foreign engineers and technical experts to the U.S. for three to six years.Zacks Rank and Stock Price MovementAt present, Alphabet is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company.

3 Questions for Apple, Inc. CEO Tim Cook Today;1/31/2017;"After the market closes today,Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) will report results for its first fiscal quarter   of 2017. Ending Dec. 31, the quarter includes the important   holiday period, raising the stakes for the company's performance.   Thanks to seasonality and the timing of Apple's latest iPhone   launch, the quarter is expected to include record-high   revenue.Apple CEO Tim Cook. Image source: Apple.makeArticleAd();While Apple's earnings release will give investors a useful   window into the company's financial performance, the tech giant's   earnings call will likely provide investors with some useful   nuggets, too. Ahead the earnings call, which will take place   shortly after Apple releases its financial results for the   quarter, here are three topics Apple CEO Tim Cook will hopefully   address.1. How confident is management in its product pipeline?Recently, Apple's iPhone business has not only leveled off,   but it has also been in decline. In Apple's fourth fiscal quarter   of 2016, for instance, iPhone revenue and unit sales were down   13% and 5% year over year, respectively. While some investors may   be hoping the iPhone can return to growth in Apple's first   quarter, investors -- or Apple -- shouldn't count on the iPhone   to be a major growth driver for the company in the future.Since iPhone accounts for about 60% of Apple's total sales,   the segment's headwinds make the health of the tech giant's   product pipeline more important than ever. Of course, given the   company's tendency to keep things secret, investors shouldn't   expect to get any specific information on new products from Cook   during Apple's earnings call, but investors can still look for   the CEO to talk about his level of confidence in the company's   upcoming products.2. What could Apple's services revenue growth look like in   2017?As Apple's iPhone, iPad, Mac, and other products segments   turning to year-over-year revenue declines recently, the   company's services segment, which includes sales from iTunes,   Apple Music, the App Store, iCloud, Apple Pay, licensing, and   other services, has continued to grow nicely. In Apple's most   recent quarter, services revenue increased 24% year over   year.During Apple's earnings call, investors should look to see if   Cook discusses how the company expects this segment to fair in   2017 and beyond. This question could come in many forms,   including:Does Apple expect Apple Music to evolve into a significant     driver for the company?Is growth for Apple Pay accelerating? Or has it leveled     off?Are there new services Apple could launch to continue     building out its services ecosystem?How significant of a role does Apple expect services to     play in the long-term?3. If there's a tax break for repatriation, does Apple plan   to take advantage of it?Considering President Donald Trump's plan to offer a one-off   tax holiday for U.S. companies to repatriate their overseas funds   at a lower tax rate, investors are interested in whether Apple   plans to take part in such a tax break, and, if it does, to what   extent.Image source: Getty Images.Of Apple's enormous $238 billion cash hoard reported in the   company's fourth quarter, a whopping $216 billion is held outside   of the Unite States. If Apple has aggressive plans for taking   advantage of this tax break, the company could significantly   increase its dividend, boost its share repurchase program, pay   out a special dividend, or even do all three.Investors can listen online to Apple's live conference call,   which can be found on the company's investor relations website,   on Tuesday, Jan. 31, at 2:00 p.m. PT.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Apple (AAPL) Earnings on Tap: iPhone, AirPods, App Store on Display;1/31/2017;"Apple iPhone (Shutterstock photo)Apple (AAPL) is set to report first quarter fiscal 2017 earnings results after the closing bell Tuesday. The Cupertino-based tech giant, which has beaten Wall Street earnings per share estimates in two straight quarters, is expected to break its streak of declining revenue at three. And the revenue increase will be driven by the barrage of new products Apple launched in the past three months.Notably, Apple’s iPhone 7 and 7 Plus devices. Beyond the new line of MacBooks and iPads, analysts may get a glimpse of the degree of demand Apple enjoyed for its wireless AirPods, of which CEO Tim Cook in December hinted that Apple couldn’t make them fast enough. Investors are also eager to learn how well Apple’s services business has performed.makeArticleAd();Apple earlier this month disclosed its App Storeexperienced a 40% year-over-year surgein revenue in 2016. Apple says on New Year's day alone, customers spent nearly $240 million on apps and in-app purchases, marking the App Store's largest single-day of sales ever. For that matter, the App Store in December logged its highest-grossing month in its history, generating some $3 billion in revenue. How much of that total trickled to the bottom line during the quarter remains to be seen.The company also said it posted a 74% surge in billings from subscription services like Netflix (NFLX), popular dating app Tinder and Time Warner's (TWX) HBO Now, reaching to $2.7 billion.Why is all of this important? Apple has increasingly emphasized the cash flow generated from its Services segment. The Services business, which includes the App Store, revenues from Apple Pay and Apple Music, rose 24% in the fourth quarter, posting revenue of $6.3 billion. This was preceded by a 19% rise in the third quarter.In other words, Apple realizes it can not live by iPhones alone. Can it maintain the uptrend? On Tuesday analysts will scrutinize just how much closer Apple is to that reality. But for now, the iPhone remains Apple’s cash cow. And, beyond the headline earnings and revenue numbers, that’s where the focus will be. Despite fears about longer upgrade cycles, increased competition and slow growth in emerging markets, analysts are generally positive about the recantation the iPhone 7 has received.In the three months that ended December, analysts expect Apple to report earnings per share of $3.23, down from $3.28 in the year-earlier on revenue of revenue of $77.4 billion. This compares to Apple's guidance range of $76 billion to $78 billion when it last reported earnings in October. Analysts expect Apple to have sold 78 million iPhones, which would be a 4% rise from the 75 million sold a year ago.Average selling prices, meanwhile, are projected to be $687 per unit, down $735 a year ago. However, thanks to prospect of higher shipments, iPhone revenues are expected to rise 3% to $53.1 billion. Meanwhile, data compiled by FactSet suggests Services revenue will reach $6.9 billion, up 13% year over year. To the extent Apple can beat on both the top and bottom lines, exceeds iPhone unit salesandprovide confident guidance, Apple stock should continue to climb.Apple shares, which have a consensus Buy rating and $135 price target, closed Monday at $121.68, down 0.22%. The shares have risen 5.06% year to date, compared with a 1.83% rise in the S&P 500 Index."

15 Best Short-Term Stock Investments;1/31/2017;"As any stock trader can tell you, the market can be volatile. That's why investment professionals typically recommend investors take a long-term approach to investing to reduce the risk of losing principal. If you invest at the wrong time, you could lose a significant amount of your money overnight, so keep in mind that stocks are not always the best short-term investments.That said, stock prices work both ways. A prudent — or lucky — investor could make a great deal of money just as rapidly as he could lose it. If you have a tolerance for risk and are willing to do the research, short-term trading might be a solution for at least part of your portfolio.If you decide to go this route, don't hesitate to contact a financial professional if you need assistance. Most important, if you're looking for stocks to buy now, do your homework to find good ones in which to invest. You can begin here with this list of 15 stocks to buy that might be thebest short-term investments for your portfolio.makeArticleAd();1. Apple:AAPLApple is one of the best-known companies in America, thanks in no small part to the iPhone. It's also the largest U.S. company in terms of market capitalization — the value of a company that's traded on the stock market — a number you can calculate by multiplying a company's stock price by the number of its outstanding shares. In the case of Apple, this number topped $618 billion as of late December 2016, coming in ahead of competitors Alphabet at $548 billion, Microsoft at $494.6 billion, Amazon at $366 billion and Facebook at $343.1 billion.Apple stock is positioned to move even higher in 2017. The company is aggressively buying back stock, which reduces the number of outstanding shares and increases earnings per share. Its latest iPhones, the 7 and 7 Plus, are the best-selling phones in its history. Apple also holds roughly $200 billion in overseas cash, which might move home this year if corporate taxes on repatriation are lowered. To top it all off, the stock is trading at just about 10 times earnings.2. Gilead Sciences:GILDIf you're looking for a short-term stock that had a rough go of it in 2016, Gilead Sciences might be your pick. The biotechnology company's sales of its hepatitis C drug declined and the stock fell 29 percent in 2016.Gilead could turn out to be one of the best stocks for 2017, however. The company trades at the compelling valuation of 6.99 times estimated earnings over the next year. It's bought back 14 percent of its stock over the past three years, and with its $32 billion cash hoard, the company might continue to buy more or make strategic acquisitions. Gilead also uses its cash to pay out a 2.5 percent dividend to shareholders. The stock could very well hit $101 in 2017, according to analysts at JP Morgan.3. Alphabet:GOOGAlphabet, formerly known as Google, is one of the world's great businesses, according to Barron's. The company owns numerous products and services including Google Maps and Google Play, YouTube, Nest, Chrome, Android, and Gmail. Analysts project 2017 revenues for the company in excess of $103 billion, which would represent a growth rate of more than 18 percent.Given the current political climate, Alphabet might see a short-term boost in the form of repatriated cash. The company currently holds about $80 billion in cash overseas, which translates to around $115 per share. Additionally, it has a lot of room for cost cutting because it spends freely on noncore businesses. Some analysts are estimating $41 per share in earnings this year, which would be huge since the company currently trades at just 18 times earnings.4. Facebook:FBEven if you don't use Facebook at home or on your smartphone, it's hard to avoid its presence in store windows or on advertising asking you to ""like"" something. The key to Facebook's financial success is its monetization of its enormous customer base. It has 1.79 billion monthly active users — and that number continues to rise. Lately, Facebook's stock price has gone up and exceeded analyst earnings estimates by an average of 21.11 percent.Facebook is still investing in ways to grow its earnings even more, with mobile ads and video revenues currently doing the heavy lifting. The company is also expecting big things out of its virtual reality investments. With a long-term growth rate of 27.6 percent, the company is expected to continue its rise.5. Citigroup:CCitigroup could benefit from a number of factors in 2017, including rising interest rates. TheFederal Reserve raised interest ratesfor just the second time in a decade in 2016. The Fed indicated that it expects to hike rates an additional three times in 2017. In response, the two-year Treasury note hit its highest rate since 2009. When interest rates rise, banks can charge more money on loans and credit cards, potentially increasing their profitability.Citigroup's stock has lagged compared with its peers' so far in 2017, which gives it room to catch up. The stock trades at just about 11 times its expected earnings for next year — and it trades at the widest discount-to-book value of the major banks. This means the stock is discounted more than 25 percent compared with the price-earnings ratios of its peers, making it a possible value play.6. IBM:IBMIBM is another turnaround candidate for 2017. The company used to dominate the computer hardware and services business sector but has been surpassed in recent years by its competitors. However, its slow turn toward the more modern businesses of artificial intelligence, cloud computing, mobility and security is showing signs of bearing fruit.The company spent more than $5 billion in acquisitions in 2016 alone, and its new product lines now account for more than 40 percent of firm revenues. Its analytics division showed revenue growth of 16 percent, and its cloud business jumped by 42 percent — both hopeful signs for future growth. IBM's artificial intelligence business has generated positive buzz thanks to its Watson cognitive system, which is known for beating two human ""Jeopardy!"" contestants. The stock trades at a 12.19 price-earnings ratio based on expected 2017 earnings.7. Norwegian Cruise Line:NCLHNorwegian Cruise Line is poised to benefit from the rapidly growing cruise segment and could be one of the best stocks to buy now. With the core demographic of aging baby boomers on the rise, cruise lines are a growing market. The company doesn't pay dividends to shareholders but reinvests its cash flow into building more ships and expanding its routes. Norwegian has already won approval to sail to Cuba, and it has repositioned its calendar to deploy ships into the fast-growing Asian market for the first time in 15 years.Norwegian boasts the newest fleet among its major North American competitors, making it attractive to customers looking for the latest and greatest offerings. The company owns a diversified portfolio of maritime brands including Oceania and Regent Seven Seas. Analysts estimate the stock will grow earnings by more than 18 percent in 2017 — the stock trades at just 14 times 2017 estimates.8. Amazon:AMZNAmazon has grown from an online bookseller to the eighth-largest retailer in the world, and it hasn't shown any signs of slowing down. Amazon will become the largest apparel seller in the U.S. by 2021, when it will be selling $62 billion in apparel annually — more than TJ Maxx and Macy's combined — according to analysts at Cowen Group.Amazon is firing on multiple fronts: It's poised to capitalize on streaming media's popularity via its Amazon Prime subscription service. Additionally, its Web Services business is more advanced than competitors Microsoft and Alphabet's cloud offerings, thanks to it being first to market. Analysts at Evercore ISI Institutional Equities cite Amazon as the best internet stock for 2017. Excitement is also brewing over Amazon's latest foray into the grocery business, Amazon Go. In true disruptor fashion, Amazon's take on the grocery store is to use sensors rather than grocery clerks.9. Restoration Hardware:RHRestoration Hardware is a well-known, luxury home furnishings brand that suffered through 2016. Its earnings fell and triggered a stock sell-off in which shares lost more than half their value. However, the company has shown some signs of being a possible candidate for short-term traders. In its most recent quarter, revenue actually rose 3 percent and beat analysts' estimates by more than $20 million. Earnings also beat Wall Street expectations by 4 cents per share.In addition to rebounding sales and earnings, Restoration Hardware conducted an image makeover. Going forward, the company will be called simply ""RH."" Additionally, the company has launched a new, RH Modern line. In an attempt to capitalize on a more current type of revenue stream, RH is now offering annual memberships. As a result, analysts peg the company's five-year earnings growth rate at 20.33 percent, with earnings for the upcoming year jumping 61.27 percent.10. Toll Brothers:TOLToll Brothers is a leading luxury home builder, a business that's been hit hard on many fronts. Although risks remain, the fear of rising interest rates dampening homebuying activity has sent Toll Brothers stock to a bargain price. The company now trades at less than 10 times its anticipated 2017 earnings, which are expected by some to rise 20 percent.Some concerns over the luxury condo market in New York City also hang over the stock, but company reps indicate that earnings will hold up. With the stock seemingly priced for a worst-case scenario, its valuation of about 1.2 times book value is compelling. If housing markets hold firm or interest rates don't rise dramatically, Toll Brothers stock could prove surprising to those anticipating the worst.11. Deutsche Telekom:DTEGYDeutsche Telekom is a German stock that many investors might recognize as the former parent of U.S. T-Mobile. The company still owns a 65 percent stake in the independently traded T-Mobile — and that stock has been skyrocketing. Deutsche's core European telecom business trades at a discount compared with its peers — it fell by 13 percent in 2016 — even though it's the leading wired and wireless operator in Germany. Sporting a nearly 4 percent yield, some analysts describe the stock as undervalued.A takeover play might happen in 2017: Comcast has had its eye on T-Mobile as a potential purchase. T-Mobile might also make another attempt to merge with Sprint, which could end up being a catalyst for Deutsche's stock. If everything falls into place, a share price of $20 isn't inconceivable.12. Sprouts Farmers Market:SFMSprouts Farmers Market flies under the radar of many investors because it's not really a headline-making stock. This lack of publicity might work to its advantage, however, as more investors become aware of its potential. Sprouts is drawing customers from the growing natural and organic food segment — and it prices its goods below that of its notable peer, Whole Foods Market. As a result, some analysts see the company generating mid-teens earnings and revenue growth in the foreseeable future.The company is growing out of its base in the American Southwest and moving east, growing 14 percent in square footage every year. Coupled with its favorable market segments, Sprouts is generating positive cash flow and returning cash to shareholders via a stock buyback program. At 20.5 times estimated 2017 earnings, the stock could be ready to move.13. Delta Air Lines:DALDelta Air Lines has greatly improved its financial performance but still trades at a typical airline multiple of about nine times estimated 2017 earnings. Since 2009, Delta has worked to cut its debt in half. As a result, it now has an investment grade rating from independent ratings service Moody's. To further entice shareholders, Delta pays a 1.7 percent dividend and has aggressively repurchased stock.Delta management feels the stock should be valued more like a diversified industrial company, which would dramatically raise its multiple, and, therefore, its share price. If you need another short-term catalyst, look at the company's free cash flow. Delta is a cash-flow machine — it generated $4.1 billion in cash flow in the last 12 months alone and put just 9.8 percent of that into dividend payments, according to Forbes.14. Novartis:NVTSAnother value play for 2017 could be Novartis, a Swiss diversified drug company and the world's biggest prescription drugmaker. The company's share price had a difficult 2016 but now trades at about 15 times next year's earnings. With a yield of about 3.75 percent, Novartis has an analyst consensus price target of $87, some $15 north of its current price.Part of what held Novartis back in 2016 was fear over the slow start of Entresto, its heart-failure drug, but some analysts think sales will soon accelerate and could go as high as $3 billion. Novartis also gets 25 percent of its sales from high-growth, emerging markets, which makes it less dependent on the more mature U.S. drug market. The company's recent purchase of Encore Vision should also shore up its vision sales and further enable it to diversify its holdings.15. General Motors:GMGeneral Motors has been an integral part of the global auto industry for more than 100 years and has recently faced headwinds. Some market participants feel that global auto sales have peaked, and concerns over themovement to electric vehicleshave held back GM stock. Whatever the reasons are, General Motors currently trades at a low price-to-earnings ratio of 4.3. Even industry competitors — like Ford, which trades at a ratio of 6.6, and Toyota, which trades at 9.7 times — trade at higher multiples, and GM's average price-earnings ratio over the past five years is 12.2.GM could move higher as the market appreciates its emerging electric and hybrid portfolio. Some analysts feel GM has the bankroll and technology to undersell rivals such as Tesla and perhaps even compete on quality at some point. GM stock began rallying at the end of 2016, which leads some analysts to predict it could double in price over the next one or two years.Data is accurate as of Jan. 25, 2017.

3 Things Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Owners Must Watch in Q1 Earnings;1/31/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsEven ifApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) weren't the biggest company in the world (as measured by market cap), its quarterly earnings reports would still arguably be the most-watched reports for any given earnings seasons. Not only are a wide swath of many other companies linked to Apple's success, but AAPL stock itself is something of a barometer for the broad market.makeArticleAd();Source: AppleYet, the last few quarterly earnings announcements have also raised questions, not the least of which is whether or not iPhone-mania has run its course. The growth pace has been undeniably tapering off.That's going to be the hot button on Tuesday, after the close, when the Apple earnings report for its fiscal first quarter is due.Apple Earnings PreviewAs of the most recent look, Apple isexpected to post earnings of $3.22 per shareon revenue of $77.42 billion for the quarter ending in December. The company itself had guided for Q1 revenue of between $77 and $78 billion. That bottom line would be a tad lower than the $3.28 per share of AAPL stock reported for the same quarter a year earlier, though the top line would be up just a bit from the prior year's first fiscal quarter tally of $75.87 billion.Apple needs a strong showing on Tuesday. Although it has been a strong growth machine since unveiling the first iPhone a little over a decade ago, per-share profits have been lower on a year-over-year basis in each of the prior three quarters. Ditto for revenue.10 Stocks to Buy That Already Make America GreatAAPL stock investors have been patient thus far, giving CEO Tim Cook time to adjust to a maturing market. A shortfall and/or another quarter of shrinking numbers, however, may push those traders' patience over the edge.3 Things to Watch for AAPLNot that Apple doesn't have a myriad of things going on at any given time, but for the most part, investors tend to focus on what they perceive as the biggest three. The three items that will be doing most of the driving for AAPL stock after Tuesday's report are (in no particular order)…iPhone 7 salesIt's the 800-pound gorilla in the room. Strong sales of the company's flagship device can cure all other ills, but if sales of the company's most recent iteration of the iPhone fall short, little else matters.Expectations are widely varied on this front too. Cowen & Co.thinks Apple sold 58.5 million units of the iPhone 7 last quarter, while Drexel Hamilton believes Applesold 76 million iPhones- not just the iPhone 7 - during its fiscal Q1. The overall consensus, though, isan average of 77.3 million units. Presumably most of those are the 7 and 7 Plus models.Apps and Digital ContentWhile Apple used to be a hardware company that also happened to facilitate the purchase of smartphone apps, music and video media, digital content is increasingly becomingan important part of the revenue mixas saturation becomes a real issue.The company doesn't offer much in the way of expectations for how its revenue breaks down, but we do know that in the previous quarter, Apple enjoyed revenue of $6.3 billion for its ""Services"" division, which is mostly made up of its video, audio and apps arms. That was a 24% year-over-year improvement. That makes it thesecond-biggest category of product for Apple, though it's still well behind the biggest - the iPhone.Facebook Inc (FB) Stock: New All-Time Highs or New Problems?AAPL is even mulling the creation ofits own original television shows and movies, following in the footsteps of on-demand video rivalsNetflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX) andAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN).Donald Trump AgendaIt remains to be seen to what extent, if any, it will be discussed within the Apple earnings report and conference call. Maybe it won't come up at all, but there's no denying AAPL is one of the more vulnerable companies to President Donald Trump's policy plans.Not only might a strict foreign worker and immigration policy limit Apple's access to technical talent, but much-discussed tariffs on Chinese-made imports could start a trade war that leaves Apple right in the middle of it. Not only does Apple sell products to Chinese consumers, it relies on China to make many of the iPhone's key components.Bottom Line for AAPL StockWith a trailing P/E of 14.5, Apple shares are priced fairly … maybe even undervalued. That's apt to be a large part of the reason the pros are collectively rating AAPL a bit better than a ""Buy"" right now (leaning toward a ""Strong buy."") That optimism, though, is a bit suspicious in light of the lackluster results we've seen for the prior three quarters. Apple is going to have to outperform most expectations if the stock's to build any further on the 34% gain it has mustered since May of last year.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 High-Yield Dividend Stocks That Are SOMEHOW Still Bargains7 High-Yield Stocks Ripe For A Short SqueezeThe post3 Things Apple Inc.

Why Isn't Qualcomm's Pain Intel's Gain?;1/30/2017;"Shares ofQualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM) recently plunged to a multi-month low after the   chipmaker was hit by an FTCantitrust lawsuitin the U.S. andadditional lawsuitsfrom its longtime customerApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) . Apple, which exclusively used Qualcomm's   baseband modems in its iPhones between 2011 and 2016, claims that   Qualcomm withheld $1 billion in rebate payments (compensation for   that deal) after it cooperated with Korean FTC regulators, which   were probing Qualcomm.Image source: Qualcomm.makeArticleAd();This strained relationship between the two tech giants sounds   like great news forIntel(NASDAQ: INTC) , which started supplying Apple with modems for   the iPhone 7 after its exclusive deal with Qualcomm ended. The   reason is simple -- Apple could potentially buy all of its modems   from Intel if it severs its relationship with Qualcomm.But Intel shares barely budged after Apple sued Qualcomm, and   only recently rallied following its fourth quarter earnings beat.   Let's take a closer look at why investors don't seem convinced   that Qualcomm's pain can generate significant gains for   Intel.Understanding Intel's mobile strategyIntel doesn't report its modem sales separately. They're   included in its massive Client Computing Group, which includes PC   and mobile chips. The group was created in 2015 to divert   attention from the ongoing losses at its mobile division, which   previously reported its results separately. Those losses were   caused by its generous subsidization of OEMs, with co-marketing   agreements, steep discounts, and financial aid for using its   mobile Atom chipsets.By the timeIntel killed offmost of its mobile Atom chips last year, the unit had spent   billions of dollars to capture just 1% of the market. Intel's   fatal mistakes are easy to see in retrospect -- it sold off its   ARM-based Xscale unit in 2006 to focus on x86 chips in 2006, then   rejected Apple's offer to produce application processors for the   first iPhone.Since much of the Android market uses Qualcomm SoCs, which   bundle baseband modems together with ARM-based processors, Intel   realized that the Atom couldn't gain much ground in the mobile   market. Instead, it had to develop modems for OEMs like Apple,   which developed their own ARM-based processors without integrated   modems.Image source: Apple.Why Intel investors aren't excitedThe problem with Intel is that it was likely negotiating terms   with Apple from a position of weakness, due to its need to stay   relevant in the mobile market. Since Intel has a long record of   taking losses to gain market share in the mobile market, it's   reasonable to assume that Intel sold its modems to Apple at very   favorable prices for the hardware maker.Last year, Cowen & Co. analysts estimated that the deal   could  generate $1.5 billion in revenues for Intel -- which   would only equal 2.5% of its projected revenues this year. Even   if Apple dropped Qualcomm and doubled its orders from Intel, that   growth wouldn't significantly offset Intel's sluggish growth in   PC and data center chips. Moreover, those modems would likely   only generate low-margin revenues, which wouldn't significantly   boost its bottom line growth.To make matters worse, Apple throttled the speed of    Qualcomm modems in the iPhone 7 to match the slower speed   of the Intel modems. This indicates that Apple didn't choose   Intel chips because they could match Qualcomm's -- it likely only   did so to reduce Qualcomm's negotiating power. This means that   other OEMs that use stand-alone Qualcomm modems won't likely   switch over to Intel modems anytime soon. This misstep mirrors   Intel's failure in mobile application processors -- several OEMs   initially gave the Atom a chance, but it was doomed by its   inability to match the power efficiency of ARM-based designs.What Intel investors should expectIntel investors shouldn't assume that Apple's battle with   Qualcomm indicates that the two longtime partners will part ways   anytime soon. Apple andSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) have been suing each other for years, yet the   Korean tech giant is still one of its top suppliers. Therefore,   Apple is likely trying to get Qualcomm to lower its chip prices   and licensing fees instead of completely parting ways with the   chipmaker.Even if Apple abandoned Qualcomm, investors shouldn't assume   that Intel will inherit the entire modem business. Apple often   splits component orders from multiple manufacturers, and it has   enough resources to develop its own modems -- which would cut   both Intel and Qualcomm out of the loop.10 stocks we like better than QualcommWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

How Much Can Apple's Services Drive Profit Growth?;1/30/2017;"Image source: Apple.Much has been made ofApple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) services revenue over the last year or so. After   it was clear Apple would struggle to continue growing iPhone   sales following the outstanding success of the iPhone 6, CEO Tim   Cook commented that a ""growing portion of our revenue is directly   driven by our existing install base."" That is, sales of apps,   content, iCloud, Apple Care, and other Apple Services will   account for an outsized portion of Apple's revenue growth going   forward.makeArticleAd();To be clear, Apple is still very much a hardware company.   Apple's services revenue accounted for just 11% of Apple's total   sales in fiscal 2016. The iPhone, by comparison, made up 63% of   revenue. But services revenue grew 22% last year, faster than any   other segment.With stalling hardware sales growth, investors may be   wondering if growing services revenue is enough to move the   needle on Apple's bottom line.All about the marginsDespite its relatively small size, Apple's services business   generates higher margins than its hardware sales. That's simply   the nature of software, which sees wider margins as products   reach scale. And very few companies have the scale of Apple; the   company has over 1 billion devices in use.Apple's App Store sales have a gross margin of about 90%,   according to estimates from Macquarie Securities analyst Ben   Schachter. Overall, he estimates the rest of Apple's services   have a gross margin of 65%. That means Apple's services revenue   has a gross margin about twice as large as its hardware   sales.Importantly, the App Store -- Apple's highest-margin product   -- is one of the fastest-growing pieces of Apple's services. Last   year, App Store revenueclimbed over 33%. Schachter expects it to climb 28% on average over the next five   years while non-App Store services grow just 10% annually. That   means Apple's services margin will continue to expand.How it all impacts Apple's gross profitEven if hardware sales remain flat, that won't prevent Apple   from expanding its install base. As Cook mentioned in the   company's first-quarter earnings call last year, ""Because of the   enduring value of the device, their replacing is likely higher to   be given or sold to someone who will also love and use it often.""   In other words, even if Apple isn't selling more devices directly   to consumers, the user base can grow through third-party resales   or gifting.A growing user base combined with growing service sales per   unit ought to continue driving revenue growth for the segment for   several more years.A dollar in sales growth from services will carry twice the   gross profit, on average, as a dollar in sales growth of Apple's   hardware. So, even though services is a relatively small business   right now, it outpunches its weight class, providing   approximately 21% of gross profits in 2016. That number is set to   expand as more of Apple's sales growth comes from services.As an illustration of the impact of Apple's service revenue   growth, a 20% increase in services revenue in fiscal 2017 would   result in about a 4% increase in the company's total gross profit   and a 70 basis point expansion in gross margin if all else   remains equal. Considering the size of Apple, that's pretty   significant growth. Schachter estimates Apple's gross margin will   expand as much as 400 basis points over the next five years.Gross margin expansion combined with modest revenue growth and   share buybacks should continue to boost Apple's earnings per   share at a fairly steady pace. Analysts expect 13.8% EPS growth   over the next five years, but there could be even more upside   depending on how much margins expand. With shares trading at a   price-to-earnings ratio of just 14.4, shares may still be   undervalued if Apple can maintain hardware sales and continue   growing services revenue as expected.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Is the Bar Higher for the Q4 Earnings Season?;1/30/2017;"Even as Earnings growth appears to have improved notably relative to the last couple of years, positive surprises appear hard to come to by. This becomes evident from looking at the proportion of companies beating EPS and revenue estimates in the ongoing Q4 earnings season. You can see that in the comparison chart below that compares the proportion of Q4 companies beating EPS and revenue estimates with what this same group of companies reported in the preceding quarter, as well as the 4-quarter and 12-quarter averages.With results from 171 S&P 500 index members already out or 34.1% of the index's total membership, positive surprises are tracking below historical periods, particularly with respect to EPS surprises. If we see this trend continue in the coming days as the rest of Q4 reports come in, then it would mean that estimates likely hadn't dropped enough ahead of the start of this earnings season. In other words, the bar may have been bit higher this time around relative to other recent quarters.makeArticleAd();With respect to the Q4 earnings season scorecard, we now have results from 171 S&P 500 members that have reported as of January 30th. Total earnings for these 171 index members are up +6% from the same period last year on +3.1% higher revenues, with 64.3% beating EPS estimates and 54.4% beating revenue estimates. We discussed earlier how the proportion of companies beating EPS and revenue estimates has been tracking below historical periods. But we don't have that issue on the growth front, with both earnings and revenue growth tracking above other historical periods for the same group of 171 index members.The chart below shows how the Q4 earnings and revenue growth rate for these 171 companies compare with other recent periods.The Finance sector is a big contributor to the aggregate growth picture at this stage. For the Finance sector, we now have Q4 results from 57.9% of the sector's total market cap in the S&P 500 index. Total earnings for these Finance sector companies are up +11.3% from the same period last year on +3.1% higher revenues, with 67.5% beating EPS estimates and 45% beating revenue estimates. Excluding the Finance sector from the results thus far, total earnings for the rest of the S&P 500 companies that have reported would be up +3.9% from the same period last year on +3% higher revenues. This is still better growth than we have seen from the same group of ex-Finance S&P 500 members, as the comparison chart below shows.Looking at Q4 as a whole, combining the actual results from the 171 index members that have reported results with estimates from the still-to-come 329 companies, total earnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to be up +5.3% from the same period last year on +4% higher revenues. Excluding the Finance sector, the Q4 earnings growth drops to +1% on +4.2% higher revenues.For the Technology sector, total Q4 earnings are expected to be up +5.9% from the same period last year on +4.4% higher revenues.Apple(AAPL), which alone brings in roughly a quarter of the sector's total earnings, is expected to report -7.8% lower earnings on +0.4% higher revenues as it comes out with its quarterly results after the close on Tuesday January 31st. Excluding the Apple drag, total Q4 earnings for the rest of the Tech sector would be up +11.4% on +5.5% higher revenues.Facebook(FB), which reports after the market's close on Wednesday February 1st, doesn't carry as much weight in the sector as the iPhone maker. But Facebook's Q4 earnings are expected to be up +91% from the same period last year on +44.5% higher revenues.Amazon(AMZN) isn't technically a Technology stock (it's a retailer), but it is also expected to show strong growth in its quarterly report that comes out after the close on Thursday February 2nd.Looking beyond Q4, the growth pace is expected to ramp up notably in the current and following quarters, as the chart below shows.As you can see, total 2017 Q1 earnings for the S&P 500 index are currently expected to be up +8.7% from the same period last year. The chart below shows Q1 earnings growth expectations have evolved over the last few weeks.It is not unusual for 2017 Q1 estimates to be coming down at this stage of the 2016 Q4 reporting cycle, but a lot will depend on the pace and magnitude of these negative revisions in the coming days. At this stage, Q1 estimates aren't falling by as much as has historically been the case. This should add to confidence in market expectations for the following quarters when growth is expected to really ramp up.Note: Note: Sheraz Mian regularly provides earnings analysis on Zacks.com and appears frequently in the print and electronic media.

3 Stocks That Could Move Big This Week;1/30/2017;"This week,Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) ,Facebook(NASDAQ: FB) , andAmazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) are all scheduled to report results for their most   recently ended quarter, making this one of the most interesting   weeks of this earnings season. With Apple on deck, here's why   these stocks could be big movers.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();Searching for growthScheduled to report results for its fiscal first-quarter of   2017 on Tuesday, Jan. 31, investors will likely be watching a   number of key items closely. But Apple's top line for the current   quarter, and the company's guidance for revenue in its second   fiscal quarter of 2017, will likely be the main drivers behind   any moves in the stock price after the results go live.For its first quarter, Apple guided for revenue of $76 billion   to $78 billion, up from $75.9 billion in the year-ago quarter.   Investors will be looking for Apple to meet or exceed its   guidance range, particularly since Apple has reported   year-over-year revenue declines in the last three quarters.   Revenue in this range would mark an all-time high for the   company.For Apple's second-quarter revenue guidance, the number for   Apple to beat will be its fiscal second-quarter revenue in 2016   of $50.6 billion. Anything less than this figure would mean the   tech giant expects to return to year-over-year decline.Can this tech giant keep up its momentum?For Facebook's fourth-quarter earnings release on Wednesday,   Feb. 1, investors will also likely be honing in on the company's   reported revenue, though expectations for Facebook's growth are   far more optimistic than what investors expect from Apple these   days. While it's unrealistic to expect Facebook to report the   same 56% year-over-year revenue growth it reported in Q3 given   the company's tough year-ago comparison of 44% year-over-year   revenue growth, investors will likely look for any deceleration   in revenue growth to be modest. I'll be looking for   fourth-quarter revenue growth of about 45%.Image source: Amazon.Beyond Facebook's revenue growth, another area that could move   the stock is the company's reported user metrics. While any   surprises on user metrics are unlikely considering the company's   consistent upward march in monthly active users and user   engagement, a sudden pullback in user growth or engagement could   spook some investors. Investors should look for the social   network's monthly active users to increase about three to four   percent sequentially and its user engagement, or daily active   users as a percentage of monthly active users, to be 66% or   better -- figures that would maintain recent user performance   trends.Can holiday sales live up to big expectations?Going into Amazon's Feb. 2 fourth-quarter report, management   didn't provide a very narrow guidance range for expected revenue   growth. Amazon said it expected revenue to increase anywhere   between 17% to 27% year over year. This wide range for potential   net sales growth for the quarter will likely have many investors   watching the important holiday quarter's revenue.Analysts are betting Amazon's sales for the quarter will fall   at the high end of management's guidance, according to analyst   estimates compiled by Thomson Reuters. On average, analysts are   expecting net sales of $44.7 billion, up 25% year over year.If any of these companies under- or over-perform these   expectations by a meaningful margin, these high-profile stocks   could make big moves. But investors should put any moves into the   context of the companies' broader, big-picture performance and   their long-term potential; the market often leans toward   shortsightedness and can overreact to news. Still, any   significant deviation reported from these key metrics would   likely require some further analysis.Find out why Facebookis one of the 10 best stocks to buy nowMotley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent       more than a decade beating the market.

3 Stocks to Buy for Better Deals Than the Great Recession;1/30/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTheS&P 500has more than tripled since it hit its low point of the Great Recession on March 9, 2009. There were plenty of stocks to buy back then that offered incredible value. For investors that weren't old enough or didn't have the resources to invest back then, it may seem like you've missed the boat. After all, the old investing adage is to buy low and sell high.makeArticleAd();Source:PixabayAlmost every stock worth owning has a much higher share price now than it did on the day the S&P 500 bottomed in 2009, but just because share prices were lower back in 2009 doesn't necessarily mean that buyers were getting a better deal.10 Stocks to Buy That Already Make America GreatAs the stock market has risen, so have corporate earnings. Even though investors are now paying more for each share of stock, they are also getting more earnings bang for their buck. Here's a look at three stocks that are a better value today than they were on March 9, 2009.Stocks to Buy: Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS)Source:Erik DrostGoldman Sachs Group Inc(NYSE:GS) was right in the eye of the Great Recession storm. The company even received a $10 billion bailout from the government during the meltdown.In the years since the crisis, new regulations and capital requirements severely hindered bank earnings. For GS stock, the heaviest weight has been the Volcker Rule. The Volcker Rule is a provision in the Dodd-Frank Act that prevents banks from performing certain types of speculative trading.Despite the regulatory headwinds, GS has found a way to ramp up its earnings in recent years. Goldman's net income is up more than 180% since 2009, making GS stock an even better value today than it was back then. Goldman's current price-to-earnings ratio is only 14.2, 19% lower than it was on March 9, 2009.Looking ahead,  Donald Trump has pledged to eliminate many of the regulations that have been holding back the big banks. Goldman stock is in an even better position and it is a better value today than it was in the years following the Great Recession.Stocks to Buy: Visa Inc (V)Source:K rlis Dambr ns via FlickrThe market forVisa Inc(NYSE:V) is dramatically changing. While mobile competition fromPayPal Holdings Inc(NASDAQ:PYPL),Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) and others may certainly disrupt the traditional payment business, Visa should be just fine. A recentBI Intelligencereport concluded that merchant service providers (MSPs) are much more threatened by mobile payment competition than the credit card companies themselves.The proof is in the pudding. Even with the emergence of platforms like Apple Pay, Visa's profits have exploded more than 400% since 2009. BMO Capital analystPaulo Ribeiroexpects Visa's double-digit earnings growth to continue in the long-term. He believes V stock will continue to benefit from the slow death of cash and check payments.7 High-Yield Stocks Ripe For A Short SqueezeEven though V stock has been a top performer in the market since the Great Recession, that incredible earnings growth means Visa's P/E ratio is down 60% from where it was when the market bottomed in 2009. In other words, V stock is a much better value today than it was back then.Stocks to Buy: Berkshire Hathaway Inc. ( BRK.B)Source:Pete Souza via Wikimedia (Modified)If you're looking for stocks to buy in the market today that would make 2009 investors envious, it doesn't get much better thanBerkshire Hathaway Inc.(NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B). The holding company of the most iconic and successful value investor of all time is currently trading at a better value than it was during the Great Recession.Warren Buffett's BRK.B stock now has a P/E of 17, which is down roughly 21% since March 9, 2009. Buffett and Berkshire have done very well since the Great Recession. But thanks to BRK.B's 823% income growth, investors now get a better value for Berkshire shares than they did at the market bottom.If anyone can find value in the stock market after it climbs 235% in eight years, it's the Oracle of Omaha. Instead of losing sleep over stocks to buy with the market at an all-time high, why not just invest in Buffett? Unlike high school, there's no penalty for cheating off of the smart kid's paper.As of this writing, Wayne Duggan did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.The post3 Stocks to Buy for Better Deals Than the Great Recessionappeared first onInvestorPlace."

6 Reasons Why Investors Should Take A Bite Into Apple;1/30/2017;"Apple, Inc. (AAPL) is expected to revert towards the growth curve during the December quarter of 2016 after a drop in the previous three quarters which led to its first ever full-year decline of sales in a decade. However, as the technology giant prepares to announce its quarterly earnings, the invisible cloud of over-expectation is bound to envelop its stock.Here’s a closer look at the iPhone maker and why investors should consider taking a bite into Apple.1. Strong FundamentalsmakeArticleAd();Although Apple’s FY2016 revenue witnessed some decline, raising discussions over its growth and innovation story, its fundamentals remain intact. Apple maintains a healthy operating margin and in-control debt structure with its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling a whopping $237.58 billion at the end of FY2016. With a projected revenue between $76 billion and $78 billion during Q1 FY2017, Apple should make a smooth bounce back, both sequentially as well as year-on-year.2. RepatriationWhile Apple is cash rich, 90% of it is held by its foreign subsidiaries outside the U.S. to avoid the heavy taxation on repatriation. Now, with Donald Trump as U.S. President, there is the possibility that a one-time tax of 10% on repatriation may be levied to encourage companies to bring back trillions of dollars of money to the American soil.More than a decade back, a similar one-time tax holiday on repatriation was provided under the Homeland Investment Act of 2004. Apaperanalyzing companies during that period points out that “repatriations were associated with significantly higher levels of shareholder payouts, mainly through share repurchases” reflecting good governance and financial health of the U.S. multi-national corporations.If such a tax rebate is provided again, investors could benefit directly in the form of share buybacks and dividend payouts. If that isn’t the case, such repatriation may be directed towards increasing domestic investment, employment and R&D which would boost growth and hence benefit investors indirectly.3. ServicesWhile the iPhone continues to be the biggest revenue generator among all of Apple’s products, its services segment has seen an impressive growth in recent quarters. Apple’s services include revenue from Internet services (such as Apple Music, iTunes, and the App Store), iCloud, AppleCare, ApplePay, licensing, and other services. Services is emerging as an important segment of Apple’s revenue stream and is likely to grow stronger as its ecosystem of more than one billion devices expands further.4. Profit ShareAs the global smartphone market is moving towards stabilized long term growth, low-priced smartphones are becoming popular, especially in emerging markets. Thistrendhas notably weighed on Apple’s shipments which are sold much above the average selling price for smartphones.However, despite all odds, Apple still captured 91% share of all smartphone operating profit worldwide during Q3 2016 as per areport. Further, as 2017 marks the 10th anniversary of iPhone’s debut, there is great excitement building around its next iPhone model.“The iPhone set the standard for mobile computing in its first decade and we are just getting started. The best is yet to come,”saidTim Cook, Apple’s CEO.5. Research & DevelopmentApple is known for keeping its projects under wraps, however, its increased spending on research and development, from $4.5 billion in 2013 to $10 billion in 2016, displays its commitment to innovate and evolve new technology that enhances and expands its existing product range.Apple is now focusing on advanced technological areas such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, virtual and augmented reality, and automation. In aletterto NHTSA dated November, 2016, Apple wrote, “The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation.” Further, Apple recentlyjoinedAmazon, Facebook, Google/DeepMind, IBM, and Microsoft to become a founding member of thePartnership on AI.6. DividendApple’squarterly dividendhas risen gradually since 2012. The company has paid $2.49 billion, $10.56 billion, $11.12 billion, $11.56 billion and $12.15 billion as dividends and equivalents during 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively.

Apple Inc. Gets Extra Help From the Dual Camera iPhone 7 Plus (AAPL);1/30/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhenApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) first introduced its new, big and bigger smartphones - the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus - the company opted to offer a few minor features for buyers of the largest model. The 6 Plus had longer battery life, and an image stabilized camera. That basic strategy continued with the 6s Plus in 2015. But last year with the iPhone 7 Plus, AAPL included a more significant carrot in the signature Dual Camera feature.makeArticleAd();Source: AppleThe move of making a key feature exclusive to its larger phones appears to have paid off with a big increase in iPhone 7 Plus sales compared to regular iPhone 7 sales.Having more of the costlier iPhone 7 Plus models in the mix means AAPL can generate more revenue, even if overall unit sales are soft.Differentiating Between Big and BiggerHistorically, the larger-sized iPhone hasn't sold nearly as well as the ""standard"" 4.7-inch model.When AAPL first introduced the two model strategy in 2014, the iPhone 6 Plus had an immediate bump in demand from Apple fans who were hungry for a phablet. It was also very popular in Asian markets, where phablets, which can take the place of both smartphone and tablet, are often preferred. However, overall the bigger and more expensive iPhone 6 Plus only accounted foraround 20% of overall iPhone salesglobally.10 Stocks to Buy That Already Make America GreatIn 2015, AAPL added a little more appeal to the bigger iPhone, adding increased RAM to the optically image stabilized camera for the iPhone 6 Plus. However, that saw just a small uptick in sales of the bigger model.Last year, Apple rolled the dice: It decided to release a dual camera smartphone, a premium upgrade that it heavily promoted as a must-have feature. With this advanced camera system, users could take DSLR-like portraits and optically zoom in on subjects. AAPL made this key feature an iPhone 7 Plus exclusive, at the same time boosting the price of its larger iPhone. Previously, it had charged $649 and $749 respectively for the two sizes. In 2016, the company still started the iPhone 7 at $649, but to get the dual camera smartphone feature required shelling out at least $769 for the iPhone 7 Plus.iPhone 7 Sales See Big Increase in iPhone 7 Plus AdoptionTheWall Street Journalis reporting that Apple's iPhone 7 Plus strategy appears to have paid off. Citing numbers from Cowen & Co. UBS, Cowen and Creative Strategies Inc., theWSJsays that in AAPL's first quarter (ending in December), theiPhone 7 Plus is estimated to have accounted for 40% of total iPhone 7 sales, globally.Breaking the numbers down regionally, it's estimated that 52% of Chinese iPhone buyers opted for the more expensive iPhone 7 Plus, while in the U.S. it accounted for 47% of total iPhone 7 sales.Why Increased iPhone 7 Plus to iPhone 7 Sales MatterThe difference between the two iPhone models is material to AAPL's bottom line.Apple Inc. New iPads Might Be Late to the Party (AAPL)It's likely that the iPhone 7 Plus costs Apple more to manufacture than previous Plus versions - it does have more RAM, a larger battery and that dual camera system - but at least some of the additional cost is offset by the boost from $749 to $769.The profit margin for Apple on the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus probably remains roughly the same. However, with a base price that's $120 higher, having more Plus models in the mix means that even if overall iPhone 7 sales are soft, the average selling price of a new iPhone goes up. As a result, iPhone revenue could get a boost, despite sales that may not meet expectations.And, as theWSJarticle points out, there's another positive point for AAPL in the iPhone 7 Plus numbers. The fact that pricing the iPhone 7 Plus so high still resulted in big gains for the premium smartphone bodes well for later this year when the company will release the10th anniversary iPhone 8. The iPhone 7 sales numbers indicate that AAPL has additional room to price the iPhone 8 as an ultra-premium, special edition model if it chooses.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace3 Things Apple Inc.

3 Earnings Reports You Need to Watch This Week;1/30/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe markets started last week off hot, but ended with a couple slight down days thanks to the one-two punch of not-so-hot corporate earnings and worse-than-expected GDP growth.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockStill, despite the softness, theS&P 500has enjoyed a more or less steady upward trend over the past year or so, tallying around 20% gains over the past 12 months. And there are plenty of individual stocks that could break the downtrend.For instance,Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL),Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMD) andUnder Armour Inc(NYSE:UAA) are all reporting their latest quarterly numbers this week - and all investors should be paying attention.10 Stocks to Buy That Already Make America GreatLet's take a look at what's in store for these picks.Earnings to Watch:Apple (AAPL)Source:Yuanbin Du Via FlickrApple, which has more or less risen in tandem with the S&P 500 over the past year, will report earnings on Tuesday after the market close.The tech giant is looking to notch its third straight earnings beat-although a beat would still translate to an earnings decline. Wall Street is expecting $3.22 per share compared to last year's $3.28 per share, and that fall is despite expectations for a slight uptick in revenue.Apple has suffered several straight quarters of falling sales, but analysts expect a strong holiday season driven by the iPhone 7 to return the company to organic growth. Even if that growth is meager and earnings shrink slightly, I expect investors to be pleased.Remember, Apple is no longer the growth darling it once was. But 20% gains over the last year plus a solid dividend make a pretty strong case for the stock. I think investors will be reminded of the new Apple's appeal when earnings are released tomorrow.Earnings to Watch:Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)Source:Matthew Rutledge via FlickrAdvanced Micro Devices is another company that doesn't have too much growth in its near-term forecast despite sales growth. Oftentimes, companies fail to grow sales, but still manage to grow earnings thanks to cost savings or accounting tricks.But in the case of AMD, the loss per share is expected to be a penny worse than it was a year ago due to higher costs and despite double-digit sales growth.The pain isn't expected to end after this quarter either; the full-year earnings forecast is also in the red. But I do like AMD's long-term prospects, as it's introduced new products and inked new partnerships and deals, including one withAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG,NASDAQ:GOOGL.7 Awful Stocks You Need To Ditch Right AwayIf AMD happens to get battered after its earnings report Tuesday, I wouldn't hesitate to buy some shares on the cheap.Earnings to Watch:Under Armour (UAA)Source: ShutterstockUnder Armour is the only stock on this list that has earnings growth on-tap for the current quarter. And while the 4% growth Wall Street expects isn't that mind-blowing, it's a fraction of the growth that's expected down the road.Full-year earnings are expected to enjoy 13% year-over-year growth, while the five-year average is expected to top 20%. Meanwhile, sales growth is also expected to come in north of 20% and stay there in quarters to come.So far, UAA stock has been battling some headwinds: Shares are currently right at their 50-day moving average and are under the 200-day. A good earnings report could be the catalyst needed to turn that long-term average to a floor instead of a ceiling.Under Armour stock also reports on Tuesday.Hilary Kramer is the editor ofGameChangers,Breakout Stocks Under $10,High Octane Trader,Absolute Capital ReturnandValue Authority.

What to Expect When Cirrus Logic Inc. Reports Earnings This Wednesday;1/30/2017;"Image Source: Cirrus LogicWhen audio codec supplierCirrus Logic(NASDAQ: CRUS) releases its fiscal 2017 third quarter results on   Feb. 1, investors can expect another period of rapid growth from   the company. Cirrus Logic has benefited fromApple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) decision to remove the headphone jack from the   latest generation of iPhones, leading to strong sales of its   wireless headset solutions. This should drive a strong quarterly   performance at Cirrus, but the company's over-dependence on Apple   for 78% of its revenue could be a deal-breaker as far as the   broad investor outlook is concerned.makeArticleAd();Apple will drive strong growth for Cirrus in the third     quarter . . .Cirrus expects to post third quarter revenue of $475 million   to $515 million with a gross margin of 48%. The midpoint of this   guidance puts its year-over-year growth at an impressive 42%,   which is not surprising given the content gains that Cirrus has   witnessed in the iPhone 7.A teardown of the latest smartphone by Chipworks revealed that   the device uses three audio amplifiers from Cirrus, as compared   to two in the iPhone 6S. Now, the actual device is not the only   place where Cirrus is going to make money. iFixit's X-ray of the   Lightning-to-3.5mm adapter, used to connect legacy headphones to   the iPhone 7, reveals the presence of audio codecs from Cirrus as   well.What's more, Cirrus has also supplied digital-to-analog   converter chips for the Lightning EarPods, according to a   teardown of the device by the Vietnamese site Tinhte. All of this   indicates that Cirrus has received a serious bump in its chip   content at Apple. In fact, Pacific Crest Securities forecasts   additional content gains of $2.50 for Cirrus Logic with the   iPhone 7, including the Lightning EarPods and the second stereo   speaker.Encouraged by the booming business, Cirrus seems to have   directed most of its manufacturing capacity toward making chips   for the iPhone and related accessories. This is why revenue from   its largest customer shot up to 78% of total sales in the July to   September quarter, when iPhone production was being ramped up, as   compared to 63% in the year-ago period.iPhone orders from suppliers for the December quarter   reportedly stood at 89 million units. Now, the iPhone 7 and 7   Plus won't account for 100% of Apple's device sales. To provide   some perspective, sales of these two models reportedly made up   72% of total iPhone sales in the U.S. in the fourth quarter,   according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners.Assuming that 72% of the 89 million iPhone unit orders Apple   placed in the fourth quarter were for the two new devices, that   would account for approximately 64 million units. Multiplying   this estimated unit count by additional content gains of $2.50   for each device, Cirrus revenue would increase by $160 million   from the prior-year period when it reported total revenue of $348   million.This alone puts Cirrus revenue at about $508 million for the   fiscal third quarter, which falls at the higher end of its   guidance range. But apart from the dollar content gains,   Cirrus will also benefit from the production of an additional   nine million iPhone units as compared to the Dec. 2015 quarter,   when estimated volume stood at 80 million. Therefore, Cirrus is   poised to outperform even the higher end of its guidance   range.. . . but hurt its longer term outlookHowever, Cirrus Logic's outlook could prove to be a problem as   iPhone production in the first calendar quarter of 2017 is   expected to decline to about 42 million units, as indicated by aUBSreport. Earlier, Apple was expected to produce 43 million iPhones   during the period, but it has reportedly downsized production in   order to avoid an inventory glut.Assuming the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus maintain a 72% share of   overall production, these two devices will account for   approximately 30 million units in the current quarter. With the   $2.50 per unit of additional content, the new devices will add   $75 million to Cirrus' top line in the fiscal fourth quarter.To factor in the lower production volume, iPhone builds in the   year-ago quarter stood at an estimated 55 million units. This   puts the anticipated year-over-year decline in volume at 13   million units. Assuming that the production cut pertains to the   older iPhone 6S, Cirrus' revenue could drop by as much as $45   million since it was making $3.50 on each unit of the prior   generation device.Therefore, the revenue gains from the iPhone 7 will be reduced   to just $30 million after accounting for the decline in overall   production. This indicates that Cirrus could post sales of   approximately $262 million in the fiscal fourth quarter as its   revenue in the prior-year period was $232 million. Barring major   gains in other business areas, Wall Street analyst estimates   of between $312 million and $350 million in fiscal fourth   quarter revenue will be tough to beat.This tough outlook could lead to a potential sell-off since   investors will consider booking profits as Cirrus Logic shares   have already doubled in the past year.

Plenty of Grist for the Market Mill This Week;1/30/2017;"Monday, January 30, 2017makeArticleAd();Plenty of grist for the mill of the markets this week, including Personal Income & Spending today, news from the Bank of Japan's policy meeting tomorrow, news from the latest Federal Reserve meeting Wednesday, and, of course, the heart of Q4 earnings season. For a comprehensive account of these and many more events this week, check out Zacks Chief Strategist John Blank's latest Global Market Ahead:4 Good Reasons to Focus on the USAPersonal Income & Spending showed a gap of 2 percentage points: income grew 0.3% in December (analysts had expected 0.4%) while spending ran hotter at 0.5%. Income in November was revised from unchanged to +0.1%. Because we're talking about fractions of percentage points, none of this is extremely ""newsy"" at the moment, although in aggregate over time we may see some patterns emerging, and of course we'd prefer to see incomes rise as much as spending, if possible.No big names are reporting earnings until ExxonMobilXOMTuesday morning and AppleAAPLafter the bell tomorrow, although we will hear from a couple Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) companies like BofI HoldingBOFIand Heritage OaksHEOP. Other big firms like FacebookFBand AmazonAMZNwill report later in the week.It will be interesting to see how the market interprets - if it decides to interpret - events developing out of the White House over the weekend, including an executive order from President Trump to ban Muslim citizens from the U.S. from seven predominantly Muslim countries. The Trump Rally had been priced for perfection, after all, and abrupt actions such as these often have a way of seeing the markets hit the brakes a bit.Of course, the market may instead simply focus on the here and now: the proposed tax cuts and deregulation should still provide a windfall for publicly traded companies, if not in the immediate term then sometime down the road. But the divisiveness that appears to be promoted by President Trump may add a new wrinkle into the proceedings.

Can Apple (AAPL) be a Suitable Value Pick at the Moment?;1/30/2017;"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn't want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?makeArticleAd();One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let's putApple Inc.AAPLstock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock's current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Apple has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 14.75. This level compares favorably with the market at large, as the PE ratio for the S&P 500 comes in at about 20.11.If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Apple's current PE level puts it slightly above its midpoint over the past five years, with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months. Hence, this does not provide us with a conclusive direction as to the relative valuation of the stock in comparison to its own historical trend.Meanwhile, the stock's PE compares favorably with the Zacks classified Computer & Technology sector's trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 22.08. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Apple has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year's earnings) of just 13.70, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead forApple stockin the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock's price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Apple has a P/S ratio of about 3.05. This is a bit higher than the Computer & Technology sector's average, which comes in at 2.96 right now. In fact, over the last year, Apple's figure has been quite close to the sector's average, as we can see in the chart below:However, the current level lies near to the median of the stock's own historical trend (which stands at 2.93). This again does not provide us with any conclusive direction as to the relative valuation of the stock in comparison to its own trend.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Apple currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of 'B', putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Apple a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the PEG ratio for Apple is just 1.20, a level that is far lower than the industry average of 5.06. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock's earnings growth rate. Clearly, AAPL is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though Apple might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of 'D' and a Momentum score of 'F'. This gives AAPL a Zacks VGM score-or its overarching fundamental grade-of 'D'. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scoreshere >>)Meanwhile, the company's recent earnings estimates have been trending downwards slightly. The current quarter has seen one estimate go higher in the past sixty days compared to three lower, while the full year estimate has seen one upward revision and eight downward revisions in the same time period.This has had just a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has inched lower by 0.3% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has declined nearly 2%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Apple Inc. Price and ConsensusApple Inc. Price and Consensus|Apple Inc. QuoteThis somewhat dull trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineApple forms a part of the Zacks Computer-Mini industry. The industry is highly competitive and thus Apple faces significant competition in most of its operating markets from respective segment leaders like Hewlett-Packard, Google, Samsung, etc. Moreover, the demand for high-end devices has been soft recently, owing to global macroeconomic weakness, especially with currency volatility and declining commodity prices in some key regions across the globe.In fact, over the past two years, the Zacks Computer-Mini industry has clearly underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:Apple is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. However, with a sluggish industry rank (Bottom 14% out of more than 250 industries) and a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall.So, value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn bullish in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.Zacks' Top Investment Ideas for Long-Term ProfitHow would you like to see our best recommendations to help you find today's most promising long-term stocks?

The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights: Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and Intel;1/30/2017;"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL - January 30, 2017 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog includeMicrosoft(NASDAQ:MSFT-Free Report),Apple(NASDAQ:AAPL-Free Report),Amazon(NASDAQ:AMZN-Free Report),Alphabet(NASDAQ:GOOGL-Free Report) andIntel(NASDAQ:INTC-Free Report).Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations.Get #1Stock of the Day pick for free.Here are highlights from Friday's Analyst Blog:The Cloud Drives Technology Stocks This QuarterAnalysts and experts have talked at length about the importance of cloud computing and how it would transform the technology sector. But the sense of waiting that underpinned such discussions is now giving way to a sense of arrival.Several factors are making cloud computing a reality today, the most important of which are an awareness of the resultant cost reductions, awareness of the economic value of processing ever-increasing volumes of data, and recognition of the advantages of sharing resources and having anytime anywhere access to data and information.Of course, along with all these advantages comes concerns related to privacy and security, which have been further exacerbated by government snooping, gag orders and orders to turn over data in private individual devices or in servers on foreign soil that have in turn made individuals and corporations wary about adopting the cloud.But technology companies are fighting it out. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT-Free Report) for one has strongly resisted government demands as have Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL-Free Report) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN-Free Report). Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOGL-Free Report) Google has also been vocal in its opposition. It makes perfect sense when you consider that these are some of the biggest cloud computing stocks that also offer computing and other devices. So they have vested interests at both ends of the networks.Other players with similar interests are chip makers like Intel (NASDAQ:INTC-Free Report); networking companies like Cisco and Juniper; and software/service companies like IBM and Oracle.Here's a brief glimpse of three cloud companies that just reported December quarter results:IntelIntel's results this quarter were driven by both the PC and data center businesses. The PC strength was seasonal and unlikely to be sustained.Although non-volatile memory had the strongest growth rate of 24.8% and will grow even stronger this year, it currently contributes a lower share of revenue, which equates to fewer incremental dollars. Also, the business is poised to benefit from Intel's strength in the server market.Data center revenue growth of 8% year over year was helped by platform volume growth of 3% and platform price increase of 4%. Intel has new products in the pipeline and will also be integrating some technology it acquired through Altera, so this year may be less disappointing than the last when enterprise softness skewed expectations.MicrosoftMicrosoft has become a cloud-focused company, impressing analysts and investors alike. The company is making the most of legacy workloads that use its software and its all-new Windows OS, while leveraging Office productivity software and enterprise relationships to post record growth in cloud revenue.The company reported solid cloud results, with Azure revenue growing 93% (95% in constant currency) and compute usage doubling year over year. Its cloud productivity business also saw strong growth: Office 365 commercial revenue grew 47% (49% in constant currency) with seat growth of 37% and monthly active iOS and Android devices more than doubling to 65 million, Office 365 consumer revenue grew 22% (21% in constant currency) with seat growth of 20.9%.Dynamics 365 paid seats also more than doubled. Nadella promised commercial cloud annualized revenue runrate of $20.0 billion in 2018 and last quarter's $14.0 billion means that Microsoft is definitely on track to beat or exceed the target.AlphabetAlphabet doesn't break out its cloud revenue separately although independent market research data indicates that it is well behind market leader Amazon and even runners up Microsoft. In fact after the December quarter results some analysts have started saying that Microsoft has also started pulling away from the pack in its chase of Amazon.Alphabet's growth should not be discounted however because while cloud and hardware are lumped together right now, its common knowledge that most of its new hardware has been unavailable for a lot of the time. So the 62% growth in this segment seems to be less on account of hardware sales and more of an indication of strength it is seeing in the cloud.CFO Ruth Porat has said that cloud, hardware and YouTube subscriptions will be ""major revenue drivers for Google in the next several years."" This will of course require capital investment, something the company can afford given the way the search business continues to rake in cash. Capex was around $3.08 billion last quarter, that's nearly up by a billion dollars and will mostly be spent on data centers to support its cloud business.Now See Our Private Investment IdeasWhile the above ideas are being shared with the public, other trades are hidden from everyone but selected members.

But this is still a notable improvement over what we were experiencing in the recent past.Please recall that earnings growth turned positive only in 2016 Q3, having declined in each of the preceding 5 quarters.Positive surprises, particularly on the earnings front, are tracking below other historical periods at this stage. We will see if this trend continues this week as we enter the heart of the earnings season, with more 400 companies coming out with quarterly results, including 106 S&P 500 members.Q4 Scorecard(as of January 27, 2017)We have crossed the one-third mark in the Q4 reporting cycle, with results from 170 S&P 500 members, or 33.9% of the index's total membership, already out. Total earnings for these 170 index members are up +6.0% on +3.1% higher revenues, with 64.1% beating EPS estimates and 54.7% coming ahead of top-line expectations.The Q4 growth pace is notably tracking above what we had seen from the same group of 170 index members in other recent periods. But positive surprises are tracking on the low side at this stage, particularly on the earnings front. The 64.1% proportion of Q4 companies beating EPS estimates compares to 81.2% in the preceding quarter, 76.3% as the 4-quarter average and 72.2% as the 12-quarter average. Positive revenue surprises are tracking below what we had seen from the same group of companies in Q3, but are roughly in-line with historical periods.Standout SectorsSectors with strong growth and better than expected results include the Finance, Technology, Construction, Industrial Products, Basic Materials and Consumer Discretionary sectors. Positive surprises for all of these sectors are tracking above the index level.Finance: With results from 57.7% of the sector's market cap in the S&P 500 index already out, total earnings for the sector are up +11.3% from the same period last year on +3.1% higher revenues, with +66.7% beating EPS estimates and +46.2% beating top-line estimates.This is a better growth performance than we have seen from the sector in other recent periods. Please note that positive surprises are as hard to come by in the Finance sector as they are elsewhere.Strong Finance sector growth is a big driver of the aggregate growth performance for the S&P 500 index as a whole. Excluding the Finance sector, the Q4 growth pace still compares favorably with other recent periods, but a lot less so.Technology: For the Technology sector, we now have Q4 results from 59.6% of the sector's total market cap. Total earnings for these companies are up +7.2% from the same period last year on +4.9% higher revenues, with 69% beating EPS estimates and 82.8% beating revenue estimates.We will see what this week'sApple(NASDAQ:AAPL-Free Report) andFacebook(NASDAQ:FB-Free Report) reports bring, but the sector's Q4 earnings and revenue growth is about in-line with what we saw from this same group of Tech companies in the preceding quarter (2016 Q3), though it is notably tracking above the 4-quarter and 12-quarter averages. With respect to positive surprises, Tech companies appear to be beating EPS estimates at a lower proportion than has historically been the case, though the proportion of positive earnings surprises remains above the index level. Revenue surprises, on the other hand, are tracking notably above historical periods.Key Reports for the Week of January 30thTuesday - 1/31/2017: Monday has a relatively light reporting docket, but Tuesday is very busy with more than 90 companies reporting results, including 33 S&P 500 members (of which 22 are in the morning). The focus will be on Apple, which reports after the market's close.Exxon(NYSE:XOM-Free Report) will be a key report in the morning.Apple is expected to report $3.22 in earnings on $76.2 billion in revenues, which compare to $3.28 on $75.9 billion in revenues in the year-earlier period. The stock is up +9.7% since November 8th vs. +7% for the S&P 500 index and +6.1% for the Zacks Technology sector. December quarter estimates have been stable in recent days, though they have come down for the March quarter.Wednesday - 2/01/2017: Facebook is the most high profile of the 27 index members reporting results today (it will report after the market's close). The focus will be on the social media giant's ad revenues and daily active users, but the current Zacks Consensus EPS estimate is $1.13 on $8.4 billion in revenues. This compares to EPS of $0.59 on $5.8 billion in revenues in the year-earlier period. Estimates have modestly inched up in recent days. The stock has performed in-line with the Zacks Tech sector since November 8th, up +6.3% vs. +6.1%.Thursday - 2/02/2017: On a busy reporting day with 35 index members coming out with Q4 results (23 in the morning & 12 after the market's close), the most notable report is fromAmazon(NASDAQ:AMZN-Free Report) in the evening.Amazon is expected to report $1.41 in earnings (up +41.5% year over year) on $44.8 billion in revenues (up +25.4% in revenues). Estimates have come down ahead of the earnings report, but Amazon has never really been an EPS story; it is all top-line growth, particularly gains in its cloud business, Amazon Web Services. Amazon has staked a well-regarded claim to leadership in the fast-growing cloud business. The stock has been a strong performer over the past year, up +31.4% vs. +12.4% gain for the Zacks Retail sector.Note:Sheraz Mian regularly provides earnings analysis on Zacks.com and appears frequently in the print and electronic media.

What's In Store for Apple ETFs This Earnings?;1/30/2017;"Technology giant AppleAAPLis set to release first-quarter fiscal 2017 results on January 31 after market close. Since Apple accounts for over 19% of the total market capitalization of the entire technology sector in the S&P 500 index, it is worth taking a look at its fundamentals ahead of results (read:5 ETF Investment Ideas for 2017).makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');Investors should note that Apple has been on an uptrend over the past three months, locking in gains of about 11%. In fact, the stock is currently within the striking distance of its 52-week high of $122.44. The upside might weaken as our proven model shows that the company has a lower probability of beating estimates this quarter. Additionally, the positive earnings estimate revision trend, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat, is absent for the stock.Inside Our MethodologyThe stock saw no earnings estimate revision over the past seven days or 30 days. Though AAPL's earnings surprise history is strong with a positive earnings surprise of 0.11% on average in the past four quarters, the stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and anEarnings ESPof -0.93% indicating lower chances of beating estimates this quarter (read:Bartosiak: Trading Apple's (AAPL) Earnings with Options).Betting on stocks that have a combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) usually leads to profits in an investor's portfolio. Our research shows that the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70% for the stocks with this combination. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with ourEarnings ESP FilterFurther, the stock has an ugly Industry Rank in the bottom 14% with an unimpressive Growth and Momentum Style Score of D and F, respectively, though a Value Style Score of B looks good. According to the analysts compiled by Zacks, Apple has an average target price of $132.10 with about 77% of the analysts having a Strong Buy or a Buy rating ahead of its earnings. This indicates an 8.3% upside to the current price of AAPL.What's Hot This Earnings Season?Apple had recorded its first annual revenue and profit decline in 15 years last fiscal year due to the saturation of the smartphone market. In addition, iPhone sales declined in the trailing three quarters. Analysts are expecting this trend to reverse with growth in both revenue and iPhone sales when it reports quarterly results (read:Will Q4 Earnings Strengthen Tech ETFs Further?).In fact, Apple is expected to have sold78 million iPhonesin first-quarter fiscal 2017, up from 75 million in the year-ago quarter, with revenues rising to $77.9 billion.As such, sales of the iPhone remained the major driver in the upcoming earnings report that will push up the stock price.ETFs on RadarGiven the above discussion, it is clear that sales is the most important metric this reporting cycle and that an earnings beat might be in store. As a result, investors' could definitely focus on ETFs having the largest allocation to the tech titan.While there are several ETFs in the space having Apple in their top 10 holdings, we have highlighted four funds that have Apple as their top firm. All these funds have a Zacks ETF Rank of 2 or 'Buy' rating with a Medium risk outlook (see:all the Technology ETFs here):iShares Dow Jones US Technology ETFIYW- The fund is up about 8% over the past three months and Apple makes up for 16.1% of the assets.Select Sector SPDR Technology ETFXLK- The fund added more than 7% in the same time frame and Apple accounts for 13.7% share.Vanguard Information Technology ETFVGT- It surged about 7.6%.

Monday’s Vital Data: Facebook Inc (FB), Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN);1/30/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsU.S. stock futures are pulling back this morning, as President Donald Trump's travel ban on immigrants from several predominantly Muslim countries cast doubts on further economic policies. The uncertainty has placed theDow Jones Industrial Average'stentative hold on 20,000 in question amid a flood of key corporate earnings this week.makeArticleAd();Heading into the open, futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average are off 0.3%, whileS&P 500futures have dropped 0.34% andNasdaq-100futures have fallen 0.35%.On the options front, volume arrived below average on Friday, as about 14.4 million calls and 13.6 million puts crossed the tape. Over on the CBOE, puts gained traction ahead of the weekend, as the single-session equity put/call volume ratio jumped to a one-month high of 0.73, forcing the 10-day moving average to tick higher to 0.66.Turning to Friday's volume leaders, earnings was the major driver for several large tech names on the top ten most active options listing.Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) reports after the close tomorrow afternoon, whileFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) will step into the limelight after the close on Wednesday. Finally, online retailing giantAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) joins the fray after the close on Thursday.Facebook Inc (FB)FB stock saw a wellspring of call option activity on Friday at a time when many traders were seeking protection ahead of the weekend. Total volume on the stock rose to 755,000 contracts, with calls snapping up an impressive 71% of the day's take.7 Stocks to Buy That Could Double by 2018Call buying was the order of the day, as traders appear to be anticipating a post-earnings rally from Facebook this Wednesday.Following Friday's close, the 3 Feb put/call open interest ratio slipped from 0.82 at the beginning of the session to 0.75 as calls were added at a faster rate than puts among options most affected by Facebook's quarterly report - implying rising expectations for a bullish post-earnings move. Implieds are still pricing in a move of about 5.3% for FB stock, with the upper bound lying at roughly $139.50 and the lower bound resting at $125.50.For the record, Facebook earnings are expected to rise nearly 66% to $1.31 per share, with sales soaring 45.4% to $8.49 billion. According toEarningsWhispers.com, the whisper number for Facebook's fourth-quarter comes in at $1.37 per share.Apple Inc (AAPL)iPhone maker Apple is also on tap to release its quarterly report this week. Analysts are expecting a year-over-year decline of about 2% for Apple earnings, down to $3.22 per share from $3.28 per share a year ago. Revenue is expected to creep 2% higher to $77.38 billion.Even speculative analysts remain reserved on Apple, asEarningsWhispers.comreports a whisper number of only $3.23 per share. That said, iPhone unit sales and guidance amid the current geopolitical climate could be the major drivers for any post-earnings reaction for AAPL stock.As such, options traders appear to be playing it close to the vest on AAPL. Friday's activity revealed a bit of trepidation, with calls accounting for a below-average 58% of the 637,000 contracts traded on Apple stock. The 3 Feb. options series also shows a bit of concern for AAPL's earnings reaction, with the put/call OI ratio coming in at 0.74, slightly above Apple's historic pre-earnings range nearer 0.70. Furthermore, peak 3 Feb. call OI rests at the in-the-money $120 strike, hinting at low expectations for AAPL stock.Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN)Last, but certainly not least, Amazon.com will release its fourth-quarter earnings report after the close on Thursday, and it looks like evenI underestimated AMZN stock's potential. Several retailers have already reported this quarter, blaming lower-than-expected sales figures on slowing foot traffic, mainly due to the rising dominance of online shopping - a market in which Amazon commands38% of the market share.How to Trade Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock After EarningsStill, AMNZ options traders appeared reluctant to jump on the bullish bandwagon on Friday. Total volume rose to 247,000 contracts, with calls only eking out 58% of the day's take.That said, peak call OI for the 3 Feb series totals 1,300 contracts at the deep out-of-the-money $900 strike, with another 1,200 contracts at the $870 strike. So, while volume remains a touch conservative, AMZN options traders still appear to have high expectations for a post-earnings rally.As of this writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 Stocks to Buy That Already Make America Great10 High-Yield Dividend Stocks That Are SOMEHOW Still BargainsThe postMonday's Vital Data: Facebook Inc (FB), Apple Inc.

(AAPL)Apple is in the midst of a controversial move that will limit the number of apps available to consumers in Iran.The company has reportedlybeen pulling Iranian appsfrom the App Store. The App Store was first opened in the Middle Eastern country a few months ago in September 2016.7 Awful Stocks You Need To Ditch Right AwayAt first, there were numerous restrictions governing the Store, but Apple was slowly removing these. However, a credible tech news site calledTechrasasaid an popular Iranian e-commerce service Digikala hadits app removed from the App Store.The app had more than a million users. One fact worth noting is that there is no official App Store for the territory of Iran, but many companies manage to sell their apps to consumers in Iran by registering their app as being outside the country.The country has about 40 million smartphones in use, which amounts to roughly half of the 82 million population using devices.AAPL shares have risen 5.3% year-to-date.BlackBerry Ltd (BBRY)BlackBerry is looking for one last hurrah in the smartphone industry with its Mercury device.The company has managed to survive going under by slowly transitioning from a hardware maker to a software provider. While the Mercuryisn't even technically manufactured by BlackBerry,the company still had a hand in the creation of device.The gadget recentlymade an appearanceinLast Man Standing, anABCsitcom starring Tim Allen.

BlackBerry's latest smartphone will be unveiled at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona next month.Allen is a fan of the company's phones, but it is unclear if the decision to use it on the show was his idea or a decision made by one of the producers.BBRY shares have slipped 5.4% over the past six months.Delta Air Lines, Inc.

Facebook Inc (FB) Stock: New All-Time Highs or New Problems?;1/30/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) enters this week's fourth-quarter earnings report in a peculiar position: Despite the fact that FB stock is trading near all-time highs, Facebook absolutely has something to prove.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockThat's because FB has spent the past three months recovering from a rough Q3 report that sent the stock to one of its biggest dips since coming public in 2012. While the company reported a strong earnings beat, Facebook CFO warned about a slowdown in revenue growth for Q4, and said ad load might ""come down meaningfully"" in the second half of this year.The news sparked a selloff from which Facebook wouldn't really recover until the start of 2017. But recover it has - FB stock is up roughly 15% in the past month to trade near all-time highs around $113.So, what's in store for Facebook this time around?If you believe Jefferies analyst Brian Fitzgerald, FB could be sitting on the powder keg that sends Facebook through the price ceiling.Fitzgerald believes Instagram and mobile ad revenues will drive the business forward, and expects Q4 revenues to grow 46% year-over-year to $8.54 billion - slightly ahead of Wall Street's broader estimates for $8.5 billion. He also projects GAAP profits of $1.05, which are a penny higher than the consensus mark.""We remain particularly optimistic around Instagram, bottom-funnel ad units like DPAs, and Live video,"" says Fitzgerald, whose $175 price target represents 33% upside from here. ""While expense growth is a potential concern, FB has a history of under-promising and overdelivering in this area.""10 Stocks to Buy That Already Make America GreatIndeed, mobile is king for Facebook, which crossed the 1 billion mark for ""mobile only"" active users in Q3. In fact, 84% of the company's $6.82 billion in ad revenues came from mobile - up from 78% in the year-ago period. At about $5.7 billion, mobile ad sales came in more than 30% higher thantotalFacebook ad sales in Q3 2015.Still, if Facebook matches Wall Street's projections for 45.6% sales growth, that would be down both sequentially from Q3's 59% revenue expansion, and last Q4's 52% increase in sales. Which means investors will be looking for other areas of growth.They could get it in Facebook Live, the company's somewhat controversial live streaming service that has unwittingly exposed users to real-time torture and suicide videos. Still, CEO believes images and video are the future of Facebook - and the expansion and advertising of Live's services reflect that plenty.Facebook will need to show Wall Street something exciting, though, or FB could be in for its second straight quarterly tumble.Facebook shares reached all-time highs just above $133 in late October. They then dropped but rebounded to the $132 area, but were rejected following the Q3 earnings report. FB then was sent packing to the $114 level, which it fought several times before rebounding into the current rally.Now, Facebook stock finds itself challenging the $132-$133 area once more, but this time with an overbought Relative Strength Index (RSI) reading in the low 70s.And from a fundamental perspective, Facebook's forward price-to-earnings ratio of 25 isn't nearly on par with the likes of pricey Big Tech stocks such asNetflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX), but it's still a little lofty.At the very least, it'll be on investors' minds - especially if Facebook lays an egg Wednesday.More Earnings in FocusApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Jan. 31:When Apple reports fiscal Q1 earnings this Tuesday, Wall Street expects the iPhone maker to finally snap its short streak of consecutive revenue declines with a small 2% uptick in sales. Earnings, however, are expected to shrink slightly, by about 2% to $3.22 per share. Naturally, the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus will be in focus - Q1 covers the holiday season, which typically accounts for the year's biggest chunk of the iPhone revenue pie.However, Macquarie Capital's Ben Schachter thinks Services - which includes the App Store and AppleCare -might be the star of this show:""The oft underestimated and misunderstood Services segment has the potential to drive ~100 bps [=1%] of overall gross margin expansion per year for Apple. However, if one believes that iPhone units can grow with iPhone 8 and then be roughly stable going forward, we believe Services and Apps will become the growth engine for Apple.""Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Feb. 2:Amazon, on the other hand, is expected to keep up its torrid growth numbers when it reports Q4 earnings on Thursday. Profits are expected to improve by 35% to $1.35 per share, while revenues should surge 25% to $44.67 billion. Numerous brick-and-mortar retailers reported difficult holiday seasons, hinting at more gains for the ubiquitous e-tailer.How to Trade Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock After EarningsAlso promising is a note from Cowen analyst John Blackledge, who says Prime has ""maintained healthy growth."" He pointed toward a Cowen survey suggesting that Amazon Prime's customer base has grown 22% year-over-year to 50 million. Keep an eye on Amazon Web Services, however, as AMZN's cloud-based profit generator is having to contend with an increasingly aggressive Microsoft Corp.

Here’s How Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Can Reclaim Its Throne;1/30/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) has its day of reckoning fast approaching. Tim Cook has turned out to be a game manager for AAPL stock. That's not a slight against him, but a game manager comes in when your first-string QB is out for a quarter or two. The problem is that Apple needs a visionary. There's no replacing Steve Jobs, and being a game manager in a sector that moves like lightning is not what the company needs.makeArticleAd();Source:Yuanbin Du Via FlickrAAPL stock generates almost 70% of revenue from the iPhone, and that product is seeing increasing competition.The good news is that Apple has well over $200 billion in cash and investments. It can literally do anything it wants. The problem is that most of that cash is stuck overseas - although that may change under Trump - and what Cook might do with that cash is a mystery.Without a vision, Apple would probably have to make acquisitions in rapidly growing companies. However, there is one other area that AAPL stock can venture into, one that I've been saying it must get into: original content.7 Stocks to Buy That Could Double by 2018News has surfaced that AAPL is finally looking seriously at creating original TV and film content. For years, Apple has begged off of this direction. It seemed content to play around with music streaming, and licensing content from other providers for iTunes.TheWSJreported:""The technology giant has been in talks with veteran producers in recent months about buying rights to scripted television programs. It also has approached experienced marketing executives at studios and networks to discuss hiring them to promote its content, said people with knowledge of the discussions. In addition to TV, Apple indicated to these people that it is considering offering original movies, though those plans are more preliminary. Executives at Apple have told people in Hollywood they hope to start offering original scripted content by the end of 2017.""The apple is ripe for AAPL to get involved, and in a very big way. We've seen thatNetflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX) has shifted its model toward original programming and is producing really great stuff. So isAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN). YouTube Red, though, is kind of floundering right now.One thing people want is not only more content, but good content. Because Apple is so flush with cash, it can literally do anything in this arena. There is a ton of talent out there, and so many models to play with for AAPL stock.Obviously, Apple would want to create high quality TV and film, and could do so across all genres. It wouldn't even have to be an issue of streaming content alone. If Apple wanted, it could produce feature films, and buy out any of the existing movie theatre chains and rebrand it as an Apple Theatre experience, and drop in all manner of synergies like this.The concept of the ""long tail"" is still very much in play, so creating independent work for a price, or returning to a version of the old studio system might also yield rewards. Yet there are other models, such as mining new talent from film schools and user-generated genius that's all over the place.The emerging technology of VR is another place to stretch. The ability to curate fully engaging experiences via VR, and developing technology that allows players to wear bodysuits permitting them to actually experience touch in these games is the next frontier.Can Apple Inc. (AAPL) Afford a War With Qualcomm, Inc. (QCOM)?And Apple has the money for it.

LM Ericsson Sets Sail With a New Captain;1/30/2017;"Telecom-equipment makerTelefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson(NASDAQ: ERIC) reported fourth-quarter results on Thursday   morning. Share prices rose more than 3% that day.Ericsson's fourth-quarter results: The raw numbersMetricQ4 2016makeArticleAd();Q4 2015Year-Over-Year ChangeRevenue$7.2 billion$8.7 billion(17%)Net income($177 million)$823 millionN/AOperating cash flow$2.1 billion$2.6 billion(17%)Adjusted EPS (diluted)$0.07$0.29(76%)Data source:Ericsson. Financial results reported in Swedish crowns, converted to   average exchange rates of $0.11 USD per SEK in Q4 of 2016 and   $0.12 USD per SEK in the 2015 period.What happened with Ericsson this quarter?This was a tumultuous quarter for the Swedish telecom   infrastructure veteran.Borje Ekholm took the CEO office shortly after the end of     the fourth quarter. Interim CEO Jan Frykhammar stepped down,     but will remain on Ericsson's board of directors. Frykhammar's     team of advisors, including interim CFO Carl Mellander and     executive vice president Magnus Mandersson, will stay in place     to give Ekholm guidance and continuity. That's the end of the     aftermath of former CEO Hans Vestberg's seven-year reign.A large chunk of the sales decline came from a tough     comparison against the year-ago period. In that quarter,Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) signed a patent licensing agreement with     Ericsson that settled all litigation between the companies --     and temporarily added nearly $500 million to Ericsson's top     line.On top of the Apple effect, all three of Ericsson's     reportable segments delivered lower sales and smaller operating     profits on a year-over-year basis. However, network hardware     sales increase 33% sequentially and drove global service     revenues 15% higher, thanks to strong order volumes in several     key markets.Image source: Ericsson.Ericsson's management did not provide firm guidance targets   for the coming quarter or fiscal year. Instead, they said that   markets would stay ""tough"" in 2017, putting pressure on sales   expectations. Gross margins are expected to improve in the second   half of 2017, ending a negative streak that started in the spring   of 2016.What management had to sayIn aconference callwith Wall Street analysts, Ekholm provided a reminder of what   Ericsson is all about. Investors might see this note as a call to   arms, getting back to the nuts and bolts of running a   multinational technology business. Ekholm said:We are in a technology industry. We need to be technology     leaders and stay at the forefront of the technology     development. Ericsson has a unique set of assets with our     products but we also have services and solutions, and that     package creates a unique position for us to compete in the     market. That's something we need to leverage, but it's also     something we continuously need to invest in and develop.Looking aheadWith degrees in electrical engineering and economics and 10   years of service on Ericsson's board of directors, Ekholm seems   exceptionally qualified for his new job. Vestberg is moving   on to lead Sweden's Olympic committee, including efforts to host   the Winter Games in 2026.Ekholm is widely expected to restructure Ericsson around the   next generation of mobile technology, known as 5G, alongside   support for cloud computing and the Internet of Things. It's less   obvious where he will start slashing Ericsson's efforts and   expenses in order to achieve that sharper focus. Ekholm   reportedly started making the rounds among Ericsson's top   customers in North America, Asia, and Europe as soon as he was   selected, giving him a three-month head start.Starting in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, Ericsson   will report results in three new segments: networks, media, and   IT and cloud.10 stocks we like better than Telefonaktiebolaget LM     EricssonWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Cirrus Logic (CRUS) to Report Q3 Earnings: What's in Store?;1/30/2017;"Cirrus Logic Inc.CRUSis set to report third-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Feb 1. Last quarter, the company recorded a positive earnings surprise of 30.5%. Let's see how things are shaping up for this quarter.Factors to ConsiderCirrus Logic is a premier supplier of high-performance analog circuits and advanced mixed-signal chip solutions. The company posted better-than-expected second-quarter fiscal 2017 results.  The year-over-year comparisons on both the counts were also favorable.Notably, as per revenue segments, Portable audio product revenues accounted for approximately 89% of the total revenue last quarter. Also, Cirrus Logic generates a significant portion of its revenues from Apple Inc.AAPL. This means that there is always a risk of losing an Apple design contract, which will significantly hurt the company's financials.We remain cautious about the company as the current global economic downturn might have an impact on its performance in the soon-to-be reported quarter. Moreover, the company faces competition from the likes of Texas Instruments Inc. and STMicroelectronics, which remains a headwind.Nonetheless, continued investments in the audio segment are expected to have a positive impact in the long run. Additionally, synergies from acquisitions and expansion in the LED market continue to drive growth.Cirrus Logic, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseCirrus Logic, Inc.

3 Things to Watch in the Stock Market This Week;1/29/2017;"Stocks rose by a full percentage point last week, buoyed by a   strong initial crop of earnings reports. With that gain, theDow Jones Industrial Average(DJINDICES: ^DJI) and theS&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC)  indexes are both up by about 2% so far in   2017 after rising by double-digits last year.^DJIdata byYCharts.makeArticleAd();Earnings seasons ramps up over the week ahead as hundreds of   companies post results for the final quarter of 2016. A few of   the most anticipated reports will come fromUnder Armour(NYSE: UAA) (NYSE: UA) ,Facebook(NASDAQ: FB) , andApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) .Apple goes for growthApple shares are back at all-time highs heading into Tuesday's   report, which is expected to show that the consumer electronics   titanreturned to sales growthfollowing three consecutive quarters of declines.iPhone SE. Image source: Apple.Apple's iPhone business accounts for almost two-thirds of   sales, and so investors will be keen to know how the franchise   did over the critical holiday quarter. At its last quarterly   check-in, iPhone unit sales fell by 5% and average selling prices   declined as well. Those trends should improve to overall growth   this quarter due to healthy demand for the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7   Plus.Other data points worth watching will be gross profit margin,   which CEO Tim Cook and his executive team forecast to decrease   slightly to 38% of sales. Meanwhile, management has highlighted   Apple's growing recurring revenue stream lately, including the   24% boost in its services segment last quarter. Yet the company's   outlook for the coming quarter is likely to grab the most   attention from investors, as it will imply either a return to   shrinking sales or accelerating growth ahead.Facebook's advertising volumeInvestorsweren't thrilledwith social media giant Facebook's last quarterly report. Its   operating results showed rock-solid growth, though, with revenue   spiking 56% due to an almost-60% jump in advertising sales. Its   massive base of daily active users also rose 17% to 1.18 billion   as average revenue per user crossed the $4 mark worldwide.Yet the stock declined as Wall Street fretted about an   upcoming slowdown. ""Expect to see ad revenue growth rates come   down meaningfully,"" executives warned in early November. That's   no surprise, given that advertising has jumped at a 50% pace over   the past few years.The company doesn't have much more room to increase the volume   of ads that it drops into users' timelines, though, and so   further gains will likely come from things like increased   engagement, which don't pack the same punch as scaled-up   delivery. That's why this week's focus will likely be on how   management sees its advertising trends changing as the segment   matures.Under Armour needs a winThere's a disconnect between Under Armour's business and its   stock price heading into Tuesday's report. Its awesome expansion   streak makes it one of the fastest-growing companies in the   S&P 500, and yet it was among the worst-performing stocks in   the index last year.The sports-apparel specialist could resolve that tension by   posting accelerating sales gains along with firmer profitability   this week. However, CEO Kevin Plank and his executive team aren't   predicting a rebound in either area.Image source: Getty Images.In fact, sales growth is likely to stay at just above 20% this   quarter and for the foreseeable future, marking a slowdown from   the 30% pace it enjoyed as recently as the first quarter of 2016.   A surprise slowdown in the U.S. market is offsetting gains   internationally to keep Under Armour's growth pace about even   with executives' goals.What's really unnerved investors is the fact that   profitability has declined to itslowest level on recordas the company drives deeper into athletic shoe sales and spends   aggressively to defend market share in the U.S. Those shifts   convinced management to lower their earnings outlook through 2018   while preserving their long-term bullishness on the industry.   This week's report might produce a large stock price swing if it   alters those broad expectations in either direction.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

How Skyworks Solutions Inc Is Growing Beyond Apple;1/29/2017;"Image source: Skyworks Solutions.Skyworks Solutions(NASDAQ: SWKS) investors couldn't have asked for a better start   to its fiscal 2017. A first quarterearnings beatand a stronger outlook for the ongoing quarter sent its stock   soaring to new 52-week highs, as it rose over 13% in a single   day.makeArticleAd();For the fiscal second quarter, Skyworks believes that its   revenue will grow 8% year-over-year to $840 million, exceeding   the consensus forecast of $818 million, while earnings of $1.40   per share should significantly outpace analyst estimates of $1.24   per share.Skyworks also delivered some solid long-term takeaways in its   latest quarter. The company is now boasting of design wins at   high-volume smartphone companies in China, as it is growing its   revenue outside ofApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) . Still, Apple reportedly contributed 40% of   Skyworks' top line in fiscal 2016.However, the company has been gradually working toward winning   more business from other clients, and it has found some   success.Growing beyond AppleSkyworks' business outside of Apple increased 8% in the last   fiscal year, as Vivek Arya of Merrill Lynch pointed out on the   latest conference call. Though this might not seem really big   right now, the fact that overall revenue fell 1.3% year-over-year   in the first quarter makes the growth beyond Apple a crucial   factor for long-term success.In fiscal 2015, Apple wasreportedly44% of Skyworks' business. Thus, it can be assumed that of   Skyworks' total revenue of $927 million in the first quarter of   2016, Apple contributed about $408 million of that. By   comparison, the smartphone giant should have contributed $366   million to Skyworks' revenue (40% of $914 million) in the most   recently reported quarter. This indicates that revenue from Apple   fell about 10% year-over-year.That indicates Skyworks' growth from other clients powered its   revenue and earnings beat last quarter. This is why Skyworks   needs to aggressively pursue client diversification if it wants   to mitigate the slowdown in business with Apple.Diversifying in the right areasSkyworks Solutions is building an army of clients in China.   One of the most prominent names is Huawei. The company has been   supplying its SkyBlue technology to the Chinese smartphone maker   for its flagship Mate 9 smartphone. In fact, according to   Skyworks CEO Liam Griffin, Huawei is now the company's second   biggest client.This is a big deal for Skyworks since Huawei is now a   formidable name in the smartphone industry. According to the   latest data available from IDC, Huawei's smartphone market share   stood at 9.3%, trailingSamsung's 21% share and Apple's 12.5% share in the third quarter of   2016. More importantly, the Chinese smartphone giant has been   selling more of its high and mid-range phones, which account for   57% of its total shipments.With a higher share of Huawei's sales being driven by premium   and mid-range devices, it has been able to increase the average   selling price of its phones. When the company had released its   2015 results, its average selling price of smartphones was up 17%   to $204 per unit. Though the company has not released 2016   numbers yet, Huawei is capable of increasing its selling prices   once again as it has been introducing its flagship phones in   global markets.The higher average selling price, along with higher volumes,   is good news for Skyworks since it will be able to enhance its   dollar content in Huawei devices, which are in turn enjoying   higher selling prices. Market research firm TrendForce   points out that smartphone production will increase 4.5% this   year to 1.4 billion units. Chinese smartphone companies will   account for 634 million units of this production, with Oppo,   Vivo, and Huawei being the biggest names. As Skyworks counts all   three of them as clients, it will witness a rise in chip sales   this year as the top Chinese smartphone companies are expected to   sell 39% more phones in 2017 as compared to 2016.Therefore, higher component demand by Chinese companies to   make more smartphones will push up Skyworks' average selling   prices, since it should be able to charge a premium in the wake   of tight supply. Skyworks can also make up for the volumes that   it is losing due to Apple's slowing iPhone sales, as it can now   sell more components to Chinese smartphone makers.Moving beyond mobileSkyworks' opportunities beyond mobile. Image Source:     Skyworks Solutions.The great thing about Skyworks is that it is pursuing   opportunities beyond mobile as well. The Internet of Things, or   IoT, is one such opportunity where the company is aggressively   enhancing its presence by launching new offerings.Skyworks released new front-end connectivity modules for   machine-to-machine connectivity and IoT operations a few weeks   ago. With its latest IoT product, Skyworks should be able to   accelerate the deployment of IoT applications by encouraging   migration from 2G networks due to its low cost and compact   packaging.This product development move by Skyworks is a smart one,   since the number of cellular devices communicating with each   other will rise from 300 million at present to around two billion   by 2020, according to GSMA. As the number of machine-to-machine   connections increases, Skyworks' connectivity modules that enable   the IoT will gain more traction and lead to higher shipment   volumes.However, the company does not single out its revenue or   shipments from the IoT segment, or any segment for that matter.   But the sheer growth in the size of this market, coupled with the   company's product development efforts, should prove to be a   tailwind in the long run.The Foolish takeawaySkyworks revenue is expected to increase 8.7% in the current   fiscal year, followed by stronger growth of 10.5% next year. It   appears to be pulling the right strings to diversify its revenue   away from heavily concentrated clients such as Apple, which seems   to have hit its ownroadblocks. As a result, Skyworks is well-positioned for long-term success   as it focuses on markets that have significant room for growth   versus areas approaching saturation.10 stocks we like better than Skyworks     SolutionsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Apple Stock Has a Lot to Prove on Tuesday;1/29/2017;"Image source: The Motley Fool.One of the biggest earnings reports this week will beApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) . The world's most valuable consumer tech company   will be reporting its fiscal first quarter results after the   market close on Tuesday, and it wouldn't be a surprise if the   numbers move bothApple stockand the market in general.makeArticleAd();Apple stock hit a fresh 52-week high on Thursday, and with the   shares trading 36% off their springtime lows, it's easy to see   how proving mortal can trigger a sell-off. The silver lining here   is that just a sliver of its gains have come in the past three   months. Apple shares have risen a mere 3% since its last   quarterly report.Wall Street pros aren't holding out for much. They see $77.38   billion in revenue for the holiday quarter, just 2% more than   what Apple scored during the prior year's holiday quarter.   Analysts are also forecasting a profit of $3.22 a share, just   below the $3.28 Apple delivered a year earlier.Grate expectationsIf a 2% uptick in revenue and a 2% dip in earnings per share   seem uninspiring, keep in mind that three months ago we saw   revenue and earnings slide 9% and 15%, respectively, during   Apple's fiscal fourth quarter. A huge decline in China and a   modest slide in the Americas couldn't be overcome by smaller   gains in Europe and Japan. Apple's 24% surge in services revenue   was the lone bright spot, and no match for selling fewer iPhones,   iPads, and Macs.Bulls will argue that Tuesday's report will feature the first   full quarter of availability for the iPhone 7 and Apple Watch   Series 2 after their September debuts, but it was also when the   iPhone 6s came out a year earlier. The prior year was also the   first holiday season of Apple Watch availability.Unfortunately for Apple, Wall Street's gotten better at   forecasting its financial performances. Apple used to routinely   blast through analyst profit targets with ease when the iPad was   new and the iPhone was all the rage during the early years of the   mobile revolution. They're getting closer to the truth these   days. Apple hasn't topped Wall Street profit estimates by more   than 3% over the past year, and that's with the benefit of   aggressive share buybacks propping up profitability on a   per-share basis. Apple's outstanding share count has declined in   each of the past four years.Analysts who have chimed in with updates in the days leading   up to Tuesday's report have been mixed. Mark Moskowitz at   Barclays downgraded Apple from ""overweight"" to ""equal weight,""   concerned about the upside for all of 2017. He lowered his price   target from $119 to $117, below where the stock is at now.Credit Suisseanalyst Kulbinder Garcha checked in a day later with a more   upbeat take, but his ""outperform"" rating and $150 price goal is   based more on the potential of the hyped-up iPhone 8 that should   be released later this year than anything that we will see in   Tuesday's report.One can argue that the scene is set for Apple to shine.   Analysts are looking beyond the fiscal first quarter, and the   stock hasn't kept up with the market since its last quarterly   report. After three quarters of year-over-year revenue declines,   even a token increase could give investors a chance to exhale.   The continuing growth of services revenue could ultimately get   net margins moving in the right direction again. We won't have to   wait long to see what Mr. Market thinks. Tuesday afternoon is   just around the corner.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Will Lawsuits Force Apple, Inc. To Prevent Texting And Driving?;1/29/2017;"Distracted driving is a big and growing problem. In 2014,   3,179 Americans were killed in traffic accidents involving   drivers diverting their attention to activities like eating,   talking on their phone, or texting. It's the third most deadly   factor in modern car accidents, behind only drunk driving and   speeding.You'll be delighted to hear that iPhone makerApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) has patented a way to reduce this menace. But the   patented solution is not yet implemented on any of Apple's   devices.What gives? Let's have a look.makeArticleAd();What's new?Last week, a survivor of a distracted-driving incident filed a   class action lawsuit against Apple. The suit is not seeking a big   payout from Cupertino. Instead, it calls for an injunction   against sales of Apple devices in California until the company   implements its patented prevention method against texting and   driving on devices both new and already sold.""If texting and driving is a vessel of trouble, Apple is the   captain of the ship,"" the court filing states. ""The company   enjoys 40 percent of the smartphone market share -- far more than   the nearest competitor. And its profits are enormous. Fortune   Magazine reports that in the third quarter of 2016, Apple   generated 91% of the smartphone market's profits, equating to a   cool $8.5 billion in net profit -- or about $95 million in profit   per day.""So the suit argues that Apple plays a significant part in the   distracted driving problem, and has both a responsibility and the   financial wherewithal to do something about it. Indeed, there is   a tool on the table. The filing cites an Applepatentfor disabling a mobile device when its motion sensors and other   systems detect patterns consistent with driving a car. Filed in   2008, when the ancientiPhone 3Gwas brand new, and approved by the Patent Office in 2014, Apple   has had an eye on this issue since the very beginning of its   smartphone exploits.But again, nearly three years after that patent got an   official approval, the technology remains unused.This lawsuit is not the first legal challenge to cite Apple's   anti-distraction patent. It's just the first one that primarily   wants to force Apple's hand into doing something with this   allegedly life-saving technology. Others have been more concerned   with cash payments for damage done by iPhone-wielding   drivers.Image source: US Patent and Trademark Office.Why isn't Apple using this patent yet?Many fully granted patents never see the light of day in a   real-world implementation. This particular one could be among   those for a variety of good reasons. For example:Apple could be working on a better solution than the one     described in the '143 patent, but the new and improved solution     isn't ready for a date with the Patent Office yet.The company might have found flaws in its original     technology, which was developed and filed at a time when     smartphones were a poorly understood novelty. Real-world     experience and deeper research could have changed Apple's     design requirements in a hurry.Other companies may have unveiled better solutions for the     dangers of distracted driving, perhaps as part of efforts to     come up with fully automated driving platforms. Nearly every     major auto maker is on board with theautonomous drivingtrend now, alongside plenty of technology experts. I'd be     surprised to learn that Apple's efforts from way back in 2008     provided a better solution than what all of Detroit and Silicon     Valley could whip up nearly a decade later.That's just scratching the surface of about a zillion reasons   not to take a patented technology to market. I'm sure that Apple   will come up with many more if the lawsuit ever hits a   courtroom.Image source: Apple.What's next?No, I don't think that Apple will ever actually implement this   particular deterrent to texting and driving. Lawsuits won't   change that. Halting iPhone sales in California would be a   powerful incentive, but Apple's top-shelf legal eagles can surely   head that threat off at the pass. However, the fact that   consumers are standing up to ask Apple for help with this   conundrum could accelerate Apple's arrival at a more complete   solution.The company must balance the benefits of a life-saving safety   feature against the risk that users might find the new   restrictions too overbearing. If your phone came with opt-in   restrictions on how you can use it in the driver's seat of a car,   would you enable them? If not, you'd be part of the problem.   Therefore, this is the kind of feature that needs to be forced on   the user with no obvious way to turn it off. Otherwise, the   change is not likely to make a difference.Apple obviously doesn't want to push any of its loyal users   over to Android and other platforms, where they can continue   their risky behavior unfettered. Ideally, the smartphone industry   would come together and push out protection against texting and   driving. No fuss, no muss, and thousands of lives potentially   saved. Top-down regulations would also do the trick, but that   solution would also elicit pained groans of heavy-handed rules   from every company in the mobile industry.There may not be a real solution to the distracted driving   problem until self-driving cars go mainstream. Until then,   lawsuits and concerned users can only hope to turn Apple's   smartphone designs in a safer direction.Don't hold your breath.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Better Buy: Skyworks Solutions Inc. vs. Infinera;1/28/2017;"Investing in the tech sector can be tricky. Competition     tends to be fierce, which makes it difficult to stay one step     ahead. Two companies that have a strong history of maintaining     their edge areSkyworks Solutions(NASDAQ: SWKS)  andInfinera(NASDAQ: INFN) . Both of these businesses have been taking     market share in their industries for years, which is     impressive. But which of these two tech companies is the better     investment today? Let's review the bull thesis for each company     so we can make an informed decision.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();The case for Skyworks SolutionsSkyworks designs and builds chips that allow devices to   connect to each other. The company's semiconductors are found in   a wide range of products such as routers, tablets, cars, and   smartphones.While this industry is quite competitive, Skyworks' unique   ability to create custom and complex solutions for its customers   has given it a big edge over rivals. In fact, Skyworks chips can   currently be found in nearly all of the top-selling smartphones   in the world, including those made bySamsung, Xiaomi, andApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) .The massive boom in smartphone sales over the last few   years has been a godsend for Skyworks. The company's revenue,   margins, and profits have all soared, which has taken long-term   investors on a lucrative ride.SWKSdata byYChartsWith the Internet of Things ramping up and 5G technology set   to deploy, Skyworks looks well positioned to continue delivering   for investors from here. However, Skyworks does have   an Achilles heel that investors should be aware of.   Apple is responsible for more than 40% of Skyworks' total   revenue, which is a blessing and a curse. When iPhone sales are   booming, Skyworks' results soar. However, when the Mac maker   decides to reduce its channel inventory, Skyworks reallyfeels the pain.While Skyworks has been signing deals in recent years to help   reduce its customer concentration, Apple is such a huge component   of Skyworks revenue that these two companies will remain attached   at the hip -- for better or worse -- for the foreseeable   future.The case for InfineraInfinera is a fast growing player in the   optical networking equipment market. The company's products   make internet providers lives easier by allowing them to easily   (and cheaply) move vast quantities of data around the globe.Like Skyworks, Infinera has also benefited from a number of   tech trends. The rise of cloud computing and streaming high-def   video is making it difficult for providers to keep up with   demand. That's forcing them to invest huge sums of money to   expand their networks, which has been a boon to Infinera's   business.Image source: Getty Images.That's a wonderful backdrop, but Infinera hasstruggledover the last few quarters to translate that bandwidth   demand growth into financial success. While there are several   factors to blame, one of the biggest problems is   competition.Ciena-- a much larger rival -- has caught up to Infinera's   technological edge and has been eating the company's lunch as of   late. While Infinera's management is aware of the problem and is   investing heavily to recapture its edge, it might be a long-haul   until the company returns to top-line growth.Of course, those worries have now beenpriced into the company's stock, so investors could be in a position to win big if the company   can grow faster than market watchers expect.The better buyWhile I'm hopeful that Infinera can right its ship, there are   never any guarantees of success. For that reason, I think that   the better choice for investors today is Skyworks. Not only does   Skyworks promise high growth rates ahead, but it is already so   profitable that it pays out a fast-growing dividend and still   has enough cash left over tobuy back boatloads of stock. As long as the company can continue to make progress at fixing   its customer concentration issues, then its future is looking   quite bright.10 stocks we like better than Skyworks     SolutionsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

The Chronological History of How Qualcomm Became the Most Powerful Apple Supplier Ever;1/28/2017;"Image source: Apple.If you read throughApple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) blockbuster lawsuit againstQualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM) , there's quite a bit of animosity toward how   Qualcomm conducted its business with Apple over the years. This   was not a pleasant relationship -- at least according to   Apple.makeArticleAd();Instead, this relationship was skewed significantly in favor   of Qualcomm, and there wasn't a whole lot that Apple could do   since the iPhone fundamentally relies on cellular connectivity.   This is easily the only time that Apple has not had the upper   hand with a supplier relationship. Look no further than Apple's   ownnegotiating tacticswith now-defunct GT Advanced to see how hard Apple could squeeze   its suppliers. Yet Qualcomm was able to become the most powerful   Apple supplier ever.This story has at least a decade of history that you need to   know to fully appreciate why Apple felt desperate enough to sue.   ""I've always hated litigation and I continue to hate it,"" said   CEO Tim Cook in 2014, so we know Apple isn't trigger-happy when   it comes to suing. The Mac maker simply had enough. Note that   what follows is largely Apple's side, as laid out in the   complaint. Qualcomm will of course offer a different   perspective.That being said, let's start from the beginning.2007: Apple introduces the original iPhoneMuch of Qualcomm's patent portfolio is considered essential to   cellular standards that enable modern mobile devices to connect   to cellular networks, which is the foundation of its licensing   business. Standards-essential patents (SEPs) must be licensed to   anyone, including competitors, at fair, reasonable, and   non-discriminatory (FRAND) rates.Apple initially sourced baseband modems from Infineon, which   was subsequently acquired byIntel, for the first four years. Even before Apple ever bought its   first Qualcomm baseband, it had to pay licensing fees indirectly   through its contract manufacturers. Apple attempted to negotiate   a direct license with Qualcomm, but was unable to, according to   its complaint:Apple has been indirectly paying Qualcomm licensing fees     since 2007, when it released the iPhone....In 2007, Apple released the first iPhone using Intel (then     Infineon) baseband processor chipsets. Qualcomm required     licensing fees for using these chipsets. Rather than grant     Apple a direct license on FRAND terms, Qualcomm has instead     entered into confidential licenses with specific Apple contract     manufacturers (""CMs""), the third-party manufacturers who make     and assemble Apple products. The CMs pay the exorbitant     royalties Qualcomm demands and pass the costs along to Apple in     full.As a way to get relief on excessive royalties, Apple entered   into a ""Marketing Incentive Agreement"" with Qualcomm in 2007 that   prohibited it from marketing WiMAX devices, an emerging 4G   standard that would compete with LTE -- and which Qualcomm lacks   meaningful patents for. Obviously, if Apple can't market a   device, it won't make said device. While this was before Apple   became a major player in the smartphone market, this agreement   certainly contributed to WiMAX's death.It was around 2007 that Qualcomm allegedly stopped licensing   its SEPs to rivals, and began charging separately for licenses.   This violated thepatent exhaustion doctrineof patent law.Around 2007, Qualcomm's practice of licensing its     FRAND-encumbered cellular SEPs to competitors changed. In 2006,     Qualcomm's 10-K stated that it entered into ""License     Agreements"" with competing chipset manufacturers, and received     royalties thereunder. In Qualcomm's 2007 10-K, the term     ""License Agreements"" was replaced by ""Agreements."" Qualcomm's     2008 10-K provided that in ""every case, these agreements do not     allow such integrated circuit suppliers to pass through rights     under Qualcomm's patents to such suppliers' customers, and such     customers' sales of CDMA-based wireless subscriber device into     which such suppliers' integrated circuits are incorporated are     subject to the payment of royalties to us in accordance     with the customers' separate licensing arrangements with     us.""...Since at least 2007, Qualcomm has engaged in systematic,     continuous conduct to exclude competition in the relevant     chipset markets.2008: Turmoil in the baseband marketIn January,Analog Devicesexited the baseband market by selling its baseband business to   MediaTek for $350 million in cash. MediaTek was one of the few   remaining baseband companies.In October, Freescale announced that it was discontinuing   all mobile chips, including basebands, RF transceivers, and   more.2009: Joint ventures, negotiations, and regulatory   actionsEricssonandSTMicroelectronicsformed a joint venture, ST-Ericsson, in order to target the   mobile market, including basebands, among other chips.Knowing that it wanted to eventually release an iPhone that   could connect to CDMA networks, Apple started to lay the   foundation of procuring baseband chipsets from Qualcomm in the   near future. Incredibly, Apple was unable to get Qualcomm to   commit to its supply requirements, a standard ask of prospective   suppliers. On the contrary, Qualcomm specifically retained the   right to withhold chips as leverage.The 2009 Strategic Terms Agreement (""STA"") addresses the     process by which Qualcomm supplies chipsets and associated     software to Apple. It also restricts Apple's ability to sue     Qualcomm for patent infringement concerning Qualcomm chipsets.     While Apple generally negotiates firm supply commitments with     its component vendors, Qualcomm refused to provide Apple such a     commitment, instead arbitrarily capping its liability for     failure to supply, and reserving for itself the ability to     terminate its obligation to supply chipsets to Apple's CMs.     Qualcomm's unilateral right to terminate supply of chipsets to     Apple's CMs was retained in the Amended and Restated Strategic     Terms Agreement (""ASTA""), effective February 28, 2013.During this year, Qualcomm also found itself subject to   regulatory investigations in both Japan and South Korea over its   shenanigans.The Japan Fair Trade Commission (""JFTC"") has been     investigating Qualcomm since 2006. In September 2009, the JFTC     concluded that Qualcomm violated the Japanese Antimonopoly Act     by forcing licensees to cross-license their patents on a     royalty-free basis and agree to a non-assert provision, and     ordered the company to cease these practices....In July 2009, the KFTC levied the largest fine it had ever     imposed on a company -- $207 million -- on Qualcomm for abusing     its dominant share of the CDMA chipset market.Note that this 2009 Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) fine is   separate from another one that the KFTC just imposed a few weeks   ago.2011: Apple launches the iPhone on Verizon, and Qualcomm's   exclusivity beginsThis was a big one. In many ways, this was the year that Apple   fullygot into bed with Qualcomm, largely becauseVerizon's 3G network uses CDMA instead of GSM. As the largest U.S.   carrier, it was an important strategic move for Apple ahead of   the scheduled end ofAT&Texclusivity. Fully aware of this, Qualcomm flexed its licensing   muscles:Apple became even more reliant on Qualcomm in 2011 due to     Apple's desire to release an iPhone that could connect to CDMA     networks, such as Verizon's....Since 2011, when Apple introduced the first CDMA version of     its products, Qualcomm has charged Apple a monopolistic premium     for access to CDMA chipsets that are in all other respects     identical to chipsets sold to Apple without CDMA functionality     enabled. Qualcomm prices its CDMA chipsets without regard to     competitive alternatives.Qualcomm's exclusivity in supplyingallbaseband chipsets began in 2011. Seeking relief from excessive   royalties, Qualcomm gave Apple rebates that were contingent upon,   among other things, exclusivity. We're talking about billions of   dollars:Specifically, since 2011, Qualcomm has conditioned billions     of dollars in rebates on exclusivity or de facto exclusivity     from Apple.This exclusivity ended just a few months ago, with Intel   coming on board as a second supplier. The timing of this lawsuit   is surely not a coincidence.NVIDIAannounced in May that it is acquiring Icera's baseband and RF   assets for $367 million, with the hopes of both addressing the   baseband market as well as integrating cellular connectivity into   its new Tegra line of mobile chips.2012: Bye, TIAfter deciding to exit the baseband market four years prior,Texas Instrumentscontinued its plannedexit of the mobile chip market. TI discontinued its OMAP applications processors, and kept   ratcheting down its baseband business. TI had still been   making baseband for a few prominent customers, but now planned to   wind them down completely by year's end.2013: Another agreement, another exit, and another regulatory   investigationApple kicked off 2013 with a new Business Cooperation and   Patent Agreement (BCPA) that took effect on the first day of the   year. This was simply an agreement intended in part to provide   royalty relief. This BCPA also had the provision that Apple could   not instigate or induce any regulatory investigations, although   Apple was allowed to cooperate if approached.In general, the BCPA, effective January 1, 2013, provided certain incentives to Apple in exchange for     specifically defined business     cooperation, and provided Qualcomm certain rights to Apple     s patents. The BCPA expired     on December 31, 2016, and is attached hereto as     Exhibit A....From 2013 through mid-2016, Apple received quarterly rebates     from Qualcomm, including the rebates required under the BCPA,     called BCP Payments.In other words, Apple didn't even wait a full month following   the BCPA's expiration to file suit.Ericsson and STMicroelectronics decided to dissolve the   ST-Ericsson joint venture, with Ericsson taking over baseband   modem products. It would exit soon.Broadcomagreed in September to acquire the 4G LTE assets from   Japan-based Renesas for $164 million.China's National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC)   began its anti-monopoly investigation in November.2014: Even more regulatory investigationsBroadcom announced in June that it wouldformally exitthe baseband market, and would attempt to sell its baseband   assets. The company expected to save $700 million in annual   operating expenses as a result. CEO Scott McGregor would later   say that Broadcom was losing $2 millionper dayby trying to compete in the baseband market. Of the initial 2,500   estimated layoffs, McGregor said 500 employees were able to find   other positions at Broadcom, but 2,000 workers were let go.No wonder companies kept exiting the baseband modem market.     Image source: Intel Investor Meeting 2014.Both the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and the European   Commission opened their own investigations, commencing in   September and October, respectively.Apple attempted yet again to negotiate a direct license,   knowing that several agreements would expire in less than two   years. It was unsuccessful.Discussions dating back to at least     November 2014 between Apple and Qualcomm about a     direct license for certain patents were conducted with     the knowledge that certain of the agreements governing the     parties' commercial relationship, such as the TA and BCPA,     were set to expire at the end of 2016.Roughly a year and a half after ST-Ericsson's dissolution,   Ericsson also bailed on basebands, cutting 1,000 jobs in the   process.2015: Qualcomm makes peace with China, attempts to with   AppleIn February, Qualcomm settled with China's NDRC and negotiated   a rectification plan. The company paid the $975 million fine in   full and agreed to modify its business practices in the Middle   Kingdom. Qualcomm began charging royalty rates of 5% for 3G CDMA   and WCDMA devices, including multimode devices that use both 3G   and 4G. 4G devices that do not use CDMA fetch 3.5%. In both   cases, that percentage is levied on a royalty base of 65% of the   device's net selling price. Qualcomm offered these terms to   Apple, but Apple rejected them, not believing that the offer was   consistent with FRAND.Four years after acquiring Icera's baseband assets, NVIDIA   announced in May that it would wind down its Icera baseband   operations, conceding defeat to Qualcomm.Marvellannounced a ""significant restructuring"" of its mobile platform,   alsobailing on mobile chipslike basebands and applications processors. Annualized operating   expense savings were estimated at $170 million to $220 million;   Marvell laid off 17% of its employees.The European Commission sent Qualcomm two formal   Statements of Objection in December based on its preliminary   conclusions that ""the company may have illegally paid a major   customer for exclusively using its chipsets and sold chipsets   below cost with the aim of forcing a competitor out of the   market."" Well, now we know who that major customer is, although   Apple wasn't named at the time.2016: The end of exclusivityApple approached Qualcomm once again in February looking for a   direct license. During discussions, Qualcomm disagreed on which   patents may or may not be in fact essential, and the company   removed a public list of its patents from its website.On February 5, 2016, Apple reiterated its interest in     exploring a direct license to certain patents in Qualcomm's     patent portfolio....Apple rejected Qualcomm's attempt to shirk its burden to     prove the merits of its claims. Qualcomm thereafter removed     from its website its public list of U.S. patents disclosed to     [European Telecommunications Standards Institute] and precluded     archive searching of that list. Consistent with Qualcomm's     other hide-the-ball behavior, this action makes it harder for a     licensee to determine which patents Qualcomm has declared to be     essential to cellular standards.Qualcomm's exclusivity as Apple's baseband supplier ended in   the spring.The KFTC requested information from Apple, and Apple testified   to the KFTC in August. Less than a month later, Qualcomm   retaliated by withholding the quarterly Q2 rebate payment   outlined by the BCPA that Apple had earned as of June 30 but   wasn't due to be paid until September. Qualcomm hasn't paid the   subsequent two quarterly payments, either. The $1 billion that   Apple is seeking comprises three quarterly payments.2017: Back to the futureThat more or less brings us up to speed with how Qualcomm   extracted exclusivity from Apple, which was a key factor in   pushing out rivals. Apple is by far the largest purchaser of   stand-alone modems, and missing out on that business was utterly   fatal for rivals' baseband ambitions. In Apple's words:This conduct has foreclosed Qualcomm's competitors from     dealing with Apple, a key purchaser of chipsets, leading to the     marginalization and exit of many of those competitors, and to     the acquisition and maintenance by Qualcomm of monopoly power.     But-for Qualcomm's conduct as alleged herein, rival chipset     manufacturers would have become stronger competitors to     Qualcomm.No other Apple supplier in history has been able to wield such   power over the Cupertino company. The key differentiator was   Qualcomm's massive patent portfolio, combined with its   willingness to disregard industry norms as well as its own FRAND   licensing commitments. Perhaps more importantly for Apple going   forward, there will probably never be another supplier with this   much power ever again.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

This Week in Solar;1/28/2017;"There's a lot to get to this week in solar, so let's dive   right in.The fast and furious progress of solar energyIn 2011, then Secretary of the U.S. Department of Energy   Steven Chu launched the SunShot initiative with a goal of cutting   the cost of installing a utility-scale solar system for $1 per   watt by 2020. At the time, I called the 74% reduction in the cost   of solar in a decade ""an audacious goal.""Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();Less than six years later and three years ahead of schedule,   I'm here to say that I underestimated the solar industry.   Projects are being built for less than $1 per watt today, and   cost reductions continue to amaze even the most bullish   observers. Everything from solar panels to inverters to   permitting costs have come down in the last six years with the   SunShot program helping with the reductions. And $1 per-watt   solar will lead to a whole new surge in demand, which is very   bullish for solar companies around the world.Apple and NV Energy find common groundBerkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK-A) (NYSE: BRK-B) subsidiary NV Energy has taken its   share of lumps from the renewable energy industry over the last   few years. Solar advocates helped drive a ballot measure in   November that will give customers more choice than buying energy   from the monopoly. And casino companies, which are its largest   customers, are starting tocut their ties to the utilityand buy energy elsewhere.NV Energy may be learning that it can't take such an   adversarial approach to renewable energy and customers' desires   to buy renewables after agreeing to help Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL)   build a 200 MW solar power plant by early 2019. The utility will   buy energy from the solar plant and sell the energy to Apple for   a data center in Reno, continuing Apple's growth in solar   adoption.Corporate customers will likely be big drivers of renewable   energy in 2017, demanding clean energy to power their businesses   around the country. Maybe utilities are finally learning that   it's better to go along with the renewable-energy revolution than   fight it and lose their customers to someone else.Don't freak out about the ITC... yetThe solar industry is abuzz with speculation about the solar   investment tax credit (ITC), which helps fund every solar project   in the country today. The subsidy was extended at the end of 2015   and is currently set to startstepping down from 30% in 2019to a permanent 10% from commercial projects, and 0% for   residential projects, starting in 2022.It's no secret that most of the new Trump Administration is   less in favor of renewable energy than the past administration,   so there's concern the ITC could be in trouble. But comments from   Treasury Secretary nominee Steve Mnuchin in support of wind   subsidies, and Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson in   relation to climate change, have eased some of those   tensions.Keep in mind that the ITC stepdown is current law and would   require an act of Congress, including 60 votes in the Senate, to   be repealed. I think that's unlikely to happen, especially when   you consider the 200,000+ jobs in solar and extreme popularity of   the energy source. The ITC seems safe, despite the likelihood   that it's unpopular inside the White House. Unless something   changes, solar investors can breathe a sigh of relief.News and notesHere are the other notable items of the week that investors   shouldn't lose sight of.Eos Energy Storage andSiemens(NASDAQOTH: SIEGY)announced a partnershipto integrate, install, and service utility-scale energy-storage   solutions. It's hard to state how big it is that a giant in   electricity-distribution equipment is taking a role in energy   storage, which will help solar provide more value to the grid. We   don't know exactly what will happen with the partnership in terms   of costs or demand for utility-scale storage, but the fact that   it's on the radar of giants of the industry is big for renewable   energy.Pattern Energy Group(NASDAQ: PEGI) announced the closing of $350 million in senior   notes due 2024 with a 5.875% interest rate. The financing will   help the company pay down short-term debt and acquire more   renewable-energy projects. If this is a sign that yieldco   financing is opening up, it would be good for the entire   industry.Canadian Solar(NASDAQ: CSIQ) signed a contract earlier this week with the   Sacramento Municipal Utility District to sell energy from a 60 MW   solar farm over the course of 20 years starting in mid-2017.   There haven't been a lot of big contract signings in the U.S.   over the past year, so any movement in the space is notable, even   if 60 MW is only about 1% of Canadian Solar's annual   manufacturing capacity.10 stocks we like better than Wal-MartWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock     tip, it can pay to listen.

Microsoft's Surface Lineup Is Now a $4.3 Billion Business;1/27/2017;"Surface lineup. Image source: Microsoft.WhenMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) first launched itsSurface lineup in 2012, I had my doubts as to whether or not the company could   successfully jump into hardware.

Microsoft has adapted quickly to flops like   Surface RT, which resulted in a $900 million writedown back in   2013, and pushed forward with expanding the portfolio, most   recently with Surface Studio.makeArticleAd();Surface revenue during the fourth quarter came in at $1.3   billion, representing a sequential increase of over 40% for the   busy holiday shopping season. That's enough to bring full-year   2016 Surface revenue to an impressive $4.3 billion.Data source: Microsoft. Chart by author. Calendar years     shown.It also probably helps that CEO Satya Nadella is a stronger   leader than his predecessor, even though the Surface strategy was   conceived under Steve Ballmer. The push with Surface hardware   created a rift between Ballmer and Bill Gates, and may have also   contributed to Ballmer's ouster.Out with the old, in with the newDuring the earnings call, Nadella noted that Surface has   enjoyed three consecutive quarters of 25%-plus growth. Sales mix   is transitioning toward the newer products like Surface Pro 4 and   Surface Book, and Surface 3 sales are expected to continue   winding down.The customer reception for Surface Studio in particular has   been strong, which is especially impressive for two reasons:   Surface Studio was not widely available during the fourth   quarter, and it's extremely expensive, starting at $3,000.   Inventories for the new all-in-one should start improving this   quarter as production ramps up.Taking a bite out of AppleMore broadly, Surface is but part of a bigger push among the   Windows PC crowd to take a bite out ofApple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) turf: the premium PC market. Surface is doing   well, but it was never expected to comprise a large chunk of the   Windows ecosystem; that's what original equipment manufacturers   (OEMs) are for.CFO Amy Hood said that Microsoft's ""OEM non-pro performance   should grow ahead of the market, due to strength in the premium   device category."" In other words, high-end consumer-oriented PCs   made by Microsoft's partners are gaining traction in the market,   at a time when Apple lost PC market share for thefirst three quartersof 2016 (Apple reports fourth-quarter results next week). OEM   non-pro revenue grew 5% last quarter, outpacing the broader PC   market.Surface is profitable, tooIt's also worth pointing out that Surface is now profitable on   a gross margin basis (up 6% last quarter in dollar terms), so   those revenue gains are starting to enjoy some operating   leverage.Unfortunately, currency headwinds are adversely impacting   profitability, as Surface gross margin was up 17% on a constant   currency basis in dollar terms. There's a big discrepancy between   the currency impacts on revenue (2 percentage points) compared to   gross margin (11 percentage points), which is due to the fact   that Surface devices are manufactured in Asia and the Surface   cost structure is more vulnerable to currency fluctuations.Still, you have to give Nadella credit for being able to take   a struggling segment conceived under Ballmer and turn it into a   profitable $4.3 billion business within just a couple of   years.10 stocks we like better than MicrosoftWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

10 Stocks to Buy That Already Make America Great;1/27/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAmidst the bombast, braggadocio and fact-free claims of the 2016 presidential campaign, perhaps the most effective was the subtext contained in President Trump's incessantly cited mantra, ""Make America Great Again.""makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockThe implication of this successful sonnet of sloganism is that America is not great, at least not in its current iteration. And while certainly an effectual rhetorical rallying point for the most disaffected voters, the claim fails to hold up to scrutiny when one takes a more lucid view of the corporate and investing landscape.Indeed, there are scores of companies, and scores of stocks to own, that already make America great. These are the companies that make the products and services that Americans organize their lives around. Creators of communication devices, social media networks and information retrieval services are just a few of the brilliant achievements of entrepreneurial Americans that have made the country great through the genius of their ideas.7 Stocks to Buy That Could Double by 2018They're also among the top companies, and the top stocks, that make our nation great for investors. If you want to feel good about the country, and about the prospects for long-term portfolio performance, here are 10 stocks to own thatalreadymake America great.Stocks to Buy: Boeing (BA)Source:Phillip Capper via FlickrPremier American aircraft manufacturerBoeing Co(NYSE:BA) also is one of the largest defense contractors in the U.S. The company supplies Western military forces with the F-15 and F-18 fighter jets, which also are capable of precision strategic bombing runs crucial to defeating enemies such as the Islamic State.Just check out this footage of an F-18 delivering ISIS fighters a dead-on strike with a500-lb laser guided bomb[Graphic content warning] and you'll be convinced of the efficacy of its fighter jets in the effort against a determined, well-funded and ideologically inspired army.Yet Boeing is far more than just a builder of military hardware. The company's iconic ""7 Series"" passenger jets - the 747, 737, 777 and 787 - have allowed not just Americans, but travelers worldwide to speed off to their destinations safely, and in style. If you want evidence of American corporate greatness, just look to the sky near any major metropolitan airport. You're sure to spot the greatness of Boeing in flight.Stocks to Buy:Amazon.com (AMZN)Source: ShutterstockOnline seller of everythingAmazon.com(NASDAQ:AMZN) has been making America great for nearly 23 years. The brainchild of CEO Jeff Bezos began life as a hub where avid readers could get the latest novels, and discover both new and old works that would appeal to their tastes.That formula worked not only for literature, but for everything from music, film, video games, electronics, clothing, toys, toothpaste … and just about anything else one can require or desire.Amazon.com's relatively recent foray into the cloud computing business has been an unequivocal success, with the company raking in some $3.2 billion in cloud computing revenue in the third quarter of 2016.3 Fast-Food Stocks That Are Sweating Bullets Thanks to McDonald'sThat figure was up 55% from the same quarter the year prior. Amazon's web services business proves that not only does the company make America great by delivering the products we want right to our door, it also makes possible many of the e-commerce sites the American - and global - economy relies on to function smoothly.Stocks to Buy:Apple (AAPL)Source:Yuanbin Du Via FlickrPersonal technology giantApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) is not only one of the most profitable companies in history, it's alsothe most admired. And why shouldn't it be?The ubiquity, efficacy, ease of operation, quality, sophisticated industrial design and just outright aesthetic beauty of the company's products is a feat of entrepreneurial genius that on its own can be cited as a ""drop-the-mic"" reason why America already deserves the greatness title.The company's iconic products - the Mac, iPod, iPad and iPhone - all have transformed the way not only Americans live, but also the way most of the developed and developing nations live. AAPL stock ran into a slowdown for much of 2016, but since Election Day, Wall Street has made Apple shares great again, with a surge of more than 10%.Investors are clearly betting on the continued upside likely to come with the release of the company's 10th-anniversary iPhone. If you want proof America is already great, just check your iMessages.Stocks to Buy:Facebook (FB)Source: ShutterstockSocial media pioneerFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) is a relatively recent entry into the ranks of companies making America great, and it's done so by the sheer disruptive power of its product.The creation of CEO Mark Zuckerberg is the kind of game-changing invention that comes along infrequently, but when it does it's hard to see how we ever got along without it.From connecting with old friends to staying in contact with relatives; and from discovering new interests, nurturing hobbies and networking with others who share similar worldviews, Facebook has become an essential part of the American (and global) experience.Ironically, Facebook's flap with ""fake news"" and its ranking of certain news stories was an issue in the presidential campaign. Yet Facebook also was cited by President Trump as a key to his victory, as he told CBS'60 Minutesthat thepower of his following on the social media gianthelped him win key races where he was outspent by his opponent.The 3 Best Sector ETFs to Buy for a Profitable 2017So, Facebook not only already makes America great, it also made President Trump's campaign a winner.Stocks to Buy:Goldman Sachs (GS)Source:Erik DrostIf you were asked to compile a list of the ""Big Banks"" that have financed America's growth, as well as her ascension to greatness, it's hard not to start withGoldman Sachs Group Inc(NYSE:GS).The premier investment bank has been at the center of the financial world since the reparative, post-Civil War years, when it helped finance America's rebirth beginning in 1869.Since then the company has had a storied history of providing the capital, as well as the financial framework, that's nurtured the rise of the greatest capitalist experiment in history.In another example ofTrumpianirony, the president criticized the banks - and specifically Goldman Sachs - for transgressions that caused the near-collapse of the financial system in 2008. Yet who did Trump turn to for key positions in his campaign and in his cabinet? You guessed it,numerous Goldman Sachs alumni.The moral of the story here is that when you want your own administration to be great, you turn to those who have done great things at one of the greatest American financial institutions.Stocks to Buy:Alphabet (GOOGL)Source: ShutterstockPerhaps the only thing not great aboutAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), better known as Google, is its ghastly choice of new moniker. Yet despite its ill-fitting name, Alphabet's core product - the Google search engine - has already made information-seeking America great.Founded by then-Ph.D. students Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were at Stanford University, the tech entrepreneurs leveraged the PC and internet explosion and created the go-to source for information on just about anything imaginable.Its corporate mission, to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful, has long been accomplished. And though Google has only been in existence for less than 20 years, like Facebook, it also has become an essential part of the American and the international experience.10 High-Yield Dividend Stocks That Are SOMEHOW Still BargainsJust try to go more than a few days without using Google. It's nearly impossible, especially if you are someone who loves knowing things.Stocks to Buy:Disney (DIS)Source: ShutterstockAnyone who has grown up in America since the 1940s, or who has reared children or grandchildren over the past five decades, knows all-too-well the draw that is theWalt Disney Co(NYSE:DIS).Purveyors of iconic American characters such as Mickey and Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck, Goofy, Snow White and so many others, the company has built a media and entertainment empire by knowing what Americans (and the world) want to see.Disney's relatively recent acquisition of the Star Wars franchise is proof of the company's commitment to remaining the leader in providing entertainment with the broadest appeal.Founded on the genius of Walt Disney the man, the Disney Company was set up to be a dream factory capable of igniting children's imaginations all over the world. It's safe to say that it has done just that, and that it will remain great long after President Trump has completed his tenure in the Oval Office.Stocks to Buy:American Express (AXP)Source:Marcus Quigmire Via FlickrWhen ""American"" is part of your name, it's easy to make the short hop of logic needed to proclaimAmerican Express Company(NYSE:AXP) a company that's already making America great. Indeed, the credit card issuer, andDow Jonescomponent, offers what is arguably the best customer service in the financial services industry.Moreover, it's an aspirational brand that pulls at the capitalist heart strings of nearly every American set on achieving financial prowess. For those who've experienced it, how can you forget being approved for your first American Express card? That grant signifies an arrival of sorts into an honored clubhouse of the financially fit.Here, too, irony and the Trump administration once again collide. If President Trump and the Republican Congress can get personal tax reform passed, American Express shares may be the biggest beneficiary. The reason why is because higher income and higher net worth consumers tend to use American Express more than rival credit cards.3 Dividend Aristocrats to Buy for Income and GrowthAs such, a reduction in marginal tax rates for the nation's top earners would likely translate into increased spending via AmEx - which would funnel down directly to AXP shares.Stocks to Buy:Caterpillar (CAT)Source:Anthony via FlickrThe makers of earth-shaping equipment have literally transformed the American landscape into man's image, a feat that on its own qualifiesCaterpillar Inc.(NYSE:CAT) for a spot on the 10 stocks that already make America great.The unmistakable CAT brand is responsible for helping more builders erect more homes, shopping centers, office buildings, roads, bridges and dams than any government infrastructure project could ever do.In fact, any effort to make America's infrastructure great again would likely start with a whole lot of equipment from Caterpillar, as its heavy machinery is an integral part of massive build outs here at home, and worldwide.The CAT brand also is seen as a sort of badge of honor in the developing world, as developing nations seek to build their infrastructure in the image of the American landscape. To the rest of the world, America is already great … and they often use Caterpillar equipment to help their own nations look like us.Stocks to Buy:Tesla Motors (TSLA)Source: ShutterstockAmerica is a car culture country, and many of her most iconic brands -General Motors Company(NYSE:GM) andFord Motor Company(NYSE:F) - represent the best of American industrial prowess.While these storied brands could themselves be on any list of stocks that already make America great, one new car company embodies all of the entrepreneurial and innovative genius that's at the heart of what makes America special. That company isTesla Motors Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA).The brainchild of the ceaselessly creative Elon Musk, Tesla has proven that luxury, performance and the lack of an internal combustion engine can be a splendid marriage; one never lacking in operator excitement. In fact, the experience of driving the posh, powerful and eminently smooth Model S through traffic is akin to what it must be like piloting a modern fighter jet through a formation of P-51 Mustangs.5 Blue-Chip Stocks to Sell in FebruaryAnd while the World War II fighter helped make America great by vanquishing her enemies in aerial combat, Tesla's Model S, Model X and Model 3 are clearing a new path for automotive technology - technology that could be the American and global standard in decades to come.As of this writing, Jim Woods was long AMZN, FB, GS and TSLA stock.The post10 Stocks to Buy That Already Make America Greatappeared first onInvestorPlace."

The Cloud Drives Technology Stocks This Quarter;1/27/2017;"Analysts and experts have talked at length about the importance of cloud computing and how it would transform the technology sector. But the sense of waiting that underpinned such discussions is now giving way to a sense of arrival.Several factors are making cloud computing a reality today, the most important of which are an awareness of the resultant cost reductions, awareness of the economic value of processing ever-increasing volumes of data, and recognition of the advantages of sharing resources and having anytime anywhere access to data and information.Of course, along with all these advantages comes concerns related to privacy and security, which have been further exacerbated by government snooping, gag orders and orders to turn over data in private individual devices or in servers on foreign soil that have in turn made individuals and corporations wary about adopting the cloud.But technology companies are fighting it out. MicrosoftMSFTfor one has strongly resisted government demands as have AppleAAPLand AmazonAMZN. Alphabet'sGOOGLGoogle has also been vocal in its opposition. It makes perfect sense when you consider that these are some of the biggest cloud computing stocks that also offer computing and other devices. So they have vested interests at both ends of the networks.Other players with similar interests are chip makers like IntelINTC, NVIDIANVDA, Qualcomm and Advanced Micro DevicesAMD; networking companies like Cisco and Juniper; and software/service companies like IBM and Oracle.Here's a brief glimpse of three cloud companies that just reported December quarter results:IntelIntel's results this quarter were driven by both the PC and data center businesses. The PC strength was seasonal and unlikely to be sustained.Although non-volatile memory had the strongest growth rate of 24.8% and will grow even stronger this year, it currently contributes a lower share of revenue, which equates to fewer incremental dollars. Also, the business is poised to benefit from Intel's strength in the server market.Data center revenue growth of 8% year over year was helped by platform volume growth of 3% and platform price increase of 4%. Intel has new products in the pipeline and will also be integrating some technology it acquired through Altera, so this year may be less disappointing than the last when enterprise softness skewed expectations.MicrosoftMicrosoft has become a cloud-focused company, impressing analysts and investors alike. The company is making the most of legacy workloads that use its software and its all-new Windows OS, while leveraging Office productivity software and enterprise relationships to post record growth in cloud revenue.The company reported solid cloud results, with Azure revenue growing 93% (95% in constant currency) and compute usage doubling year over year. Its cloud productivity business also saw strong growth: Office 365 commercial revenue grew 47% (49% in constant currency) with seat growth of 37% and monthly active iOS and Android devices more than doubling to 65 million, Office 365 consumer revenue grew 22% (21% in constant currency) with seat growth of 20.9%.Dynamics 365 paid seats also more than doubled. Nadella promised commercial cloud annualized revenue runrate of $20.0 billion in 2018 and last quarter's $14.0 billion means that Microsoft is definitely on track to beat or exceed the target.AlphabetAlphabet doesn't break out its cloud revenue separately although independent market research data indicates that it is well behind market leader Amazon and even runners up Microsoft. In fact after the December quarter results some analysts have started saying that Microsoft has also started pulling away from the pack in its chase of Amazon.Alphabet's growth should not be discounted however because while cloud and hardware are lumped together right now, its common knowledge that most of its new hardware has been unavailable for a lot of the time. So the 62% growth in this segment seems to be less on account of hardware sales and more of an indication of strength it is seeing in the cloud.CFO Ruth Porat has said that cloud, hardware and YouTube subscriptions will be ""major revenue drivers for Google in the next several years."" This will of course require capital investment, something the company can afford given the way the search business continues to rake in cash. Capex was around $3.08 billion last quarter, that's nearly up by a billion dollars and will mostly be spent on data centers to support its cloud business.Now See Our Private Investment IdeasWhile the above ideas are being shared with the public, other trades are hidden from everyone but selected members.

Fitbit Inc (FIT) Stock Has Quite a Wall to Climb;1/27/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhenever high-flying stocks get their wings clipped, they are never the same on the markets.Fitbit Inc(NYSE:FIT) ended its recovery of the summer of 2016 when it warned on Nov. 2, 2016, that fourth-quarter estimates would miss estimates. Bears are all over the stock: short float stands at 43.5%. And when the company reports results in February, bulls still hope the company's wearables devices sold like hot cakes.makeArticleAd();Source:Via FitbitExpectations Lowered for FIT StockIn its third-quarter report, the company cut the current quarter's estimatessharply:""The company expects revenue between $725 million and $750 million, representing growth of 2%-5%, with non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the range of $0.14 to $0.18, and a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 33%.""At a full-year earnings per share of between 55 cents and 59 cents, FIT trades at a forward P/E of up to 13.5 times (Based on Thursday's closing price of $7.41). Investors clearly have low expectations for the company. Trailing quarterly sales grew by 23.1%. Shorts are winning the bearish bet because they understand a company with good products is not necessarily a good stock.Competition Heating UpDespite a record low valuation, low expectations for the quarter and potential growth in Europe and Asia, FIT stock has one big problem: competition. During the holiday season, consumers had the choice of buying many cheaper alternatives at a fraction of a FIT device. In Asia,Xiaomisells similar wearables for a fraction of FIT's price.On the high end, FIT competes with theGarmin Ltd.(NASDAQ:GRMN) Vivosmart HR, which costs the same as Fitbit's Charge 2 (both cost around $149.95) andApple Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AAPL) Apple Watch 1 and 2.If FIT's stock collapses post-earnings, it will be among a long list of fallen fad stocks. This includesGoPro Inc(NASDAQ:GPRO), whose action camera is losing popularity andEtsy Inc(NASDAQ:ETSY), whose handmade products compete withAmazon.com, Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AMZN) homemadestore.Fitbit's next phase of growth depends on expanding internationally. Executing on this requires good management. When management said it mishandled the Flex 2 supply chain, few investors should have any confidence on management.On Jan. 12, news broke out that Fitbit may havewantedto acquireJawbonelate last year. This is another example that suggests investors should worry about FIT's management capability.Whole Foods Market, Inc. (WFM) in the Fresh Food WarsThe company needs to preserve its cash, instead of spending it on supply chain managementBottom Line on FitbitFitbit knows that competition will worsen over time.

Samsung (SSNLF) Expected to Launch Galaxy S8 on March 29;1/27/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWith the official Galaxy Note 7 battery review out of the way, everyone has been waiting forSamsung Electronics Co Ltd(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) to release the new Galaxy S8. Samsung still isn't saying anything, but clues have been building that it will be later than normal. NowVentureBeatsays it has the first photos of the elusive smartphone as well as an exact Galaxy S8 launch date.makeArticleAd();Source: SamsungSamsung's well-publicized disaster with the Galaxy Note 7 had a big ripple effect on the Galaxy S8.First, the company had to identify - without question - what had caused Galaxy Note 7 batteries to burst into flames. Then it had to pinpoint a fail-safe solution to the problem. After that, it had to hold an event where it publicly reviewed its findings and outlined the steps it had taken to ensure it never happens again. Thatevent took place last week.Galaxy S8 Launch Pushed Back by Battery ConcernsAs part of the battery investigation, Samsung also had to take measures to ensure the Galaxy S8 would not have similar problems, and that would have involved delayed finalization of the battery and related components. And you can bet the company has taken testing of the battery on its new flagship smartphone to new levels.As a result, it seemed likely the Galaxy S8 launch date would be pushed from it's traditional Mobile World Congress unveiling in February. Samsung confirmed this during last week's event.7 Stocks to Buy That Could Double by 2018The Guardian, citing anonymous sources close to Samsung, pointed to alate March release date. Yesterday,VentureBeat'sEvan Blassclaimed to have specifics, saying the Galaxy S8 launch will take place at a Samsung Unpacked event in New York City on March 29.Galaxy S8 DetailsTheVentureBeatreport also includes many technical details about SSNLF's new flagship handset(s), including photos.As has been speculated, it appears that this year both Galaxy S8 smartphones will feature a curved ""Edge"" Super AMOLED display, but both will also lose the Home button so nearly the entire front is display - the camera remains at top. As a result, even though the overall dimensions stay roughly the same, both new smartphones will have larger displays than the Galaxy Note 7: 5.8-inches and 6.2-inches.The fingerprint sensor has been moved to the back, and high tech biometrics are supplemented by an iris scanner. The charge port is the new USB-C standard, base storage moves to 64GB (with SD card expansion still offered) and unlikeApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL), Samsung will reportedly keep the headphone jack.By connecting to an optional dock, the Galaxy S8 will be able to be used as an Android computer. And it will feature Bixby, theadvanced AI personal assistantSamsung gained when it purchased Viv in October.Apple Inc. New iPads Might Be Late to the Party (AAPL)Interestingly,VentureBeatsays the price of both models - which it says will go on sale April 21 - will be €100 (roughly $100) more than last year's models.The Importance of the Galaxy S8 LaunchIt can't be understated how critical this release is to SSNLF. After recalling 3 million Galaxy Note 7s', its reputation took a serious blow. Apple will be pulling out all the stops with the iPhone 8 later this year, as it celebrates the iPhone's 10th anniversary and mounts a major campaign to convince upgraders.Alphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) released its first Google-branded smartphone in the Pixel Phone at the height of the Galaxy Note 7 debacle, and a follow-up is expected this year.Both rivals will be gunning to boost sales at Samsung's expense.In the last quarterly sales report (from the end of October), Samsung's smartphone sales marketshare haddropped 13.5%compared to the previous year. The next quarter's numbers could be even worse. If the Galaxy S8 launch flops, Samsung's time at the top of the smartphone sales charts would likely be over.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace3 Things Apple Inc.

Can Apple Inc. (AAPL) Afford a War With Qualcomm, Inc. (QCOM)?;1/27/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsPatent wars are harmful to corporations and other growing things.makeArticleAd();Source:iphonedigital via FlickrApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) has now gone to patent war withQualcomm, Inc.(NASDAQ:QCOM), knocking 13% off the modem chip maker's market cap in less than a week.The warhas now extended to China, where two Apple suits are seeking $145 million in damages (about 1 billion Yuan) over how Qualcomm licenses patents there.This being early in the war, the response of Qualcomm CEO Steve Mollenkopf is""bring it on.""But, he hasn't seen the legal bills, yet. Shareholders, however, seem to have a clue about what they might be, and apparently feel they will be huge.Apple has yet to be hurt by any of this. AAPL stock price is up about 1.7% since the court papers were filed. But, the march to its record high of $132.54 per share, achieved in May 2015, may now be disrupted.3 Grossly Overpriced Tech Stocks That Could CollapseWhat the War Is AboutQualcomm controls standards essential patents (SEPs), including those for the Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) system used by carriers such asVerizon Communications Inc.(NYSE:VZ). This means that every CDMA phone chip maker, and CDMA base station maker, is paying license fees to Qualcomm for using those patents. Apple began doing so in 2011when it opened the iPhone to Verizon's network.Qualcomm used its CDMA patents to become the sole supplier of modem chips for the iPhone. It liked this position and refused to join industry-wide agreements covering Fair, Reasonable and Non-Discriminatory (FRAND) access to its patents, giving QCOM the power to constrict Apple's supply of modem chips.Apple eventually foundanother supplier for the chips,Intel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC), while still paying license fees to Qualcomm.Qualcomm, meanwhile,won an expensive fight with China over its patent rights, and is fighting with South Korea after gettingSamsung Electronics(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) to back down and use Qualcomm gear in its phones.The short version is that Qualcomm uses its patents to control the global phone market and Apple doesn't like that.The Risk to AppleWhile the market has discounted the risks in these fights to Qualcomm, it has not considered the potential impact on Apple. Credit the $642 billion market cap of Apple, against Qualcomm's $76 billion.There is also a whisper number on Apple earnings, due out January 31, of$77.04 billion in revenue and profit of $3.23 per share. Combine that with over $200 billion in cash and the market may be anticipating a raise in the Apple dividend, currently 57 cents per share. AAPL stock price is still floating on Christmas.But, the risks in a patent war are real. Intel had to turn itself inside-out to make those iPhone modem chips. Another generation of phones and networks is coming, and Qualcomm will have patents to fight with there, too.Apple has already suffered, the company claimed in court, losing a $1 billion rebate it says Qualcomm owed it after AAPL helpeda South Korean investigationinto Qualcomm's business practices, one that resulted in South Korea imposing$864 million in fines.So far, Qualcomm has won in China and it has won against Samsung, and Apple's legal arguments don't scare it. If Korea can get Qualcomm to pay the fine, Samsung may feel emboldened, but SSNLF isin disarrayand may not be in a position to fight Qualcomm any time soon. Apple has taken up its sword.Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Steals AI Expert Back From Apple Inc. (AAPL)Given Apple's market size, the cost of lawyers to fight Qualcomm business practices may appear to be a rounding error, but this is going to be a nasty and costly fight. Apple's autonomy in its supply decisions is at stake, as is Qualcomm's control over the market.The market has yet to discount Apple stock over the costs of this war, but I suspect that will happen soon.

Subsequently, FB stock is a very real challenger to the near-hegemonic dominance ofAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL).Honestly, the social media network is well on its way to becoming whatApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) once was before copycat competitors entered the fray: a completely unique experience and solution with no natural predators.Interestingly, much of society is turning their back towards the demographic goldmine that Facebook stock is sitting on. The NFL celebrates ""Hispanic Heritage Month,"" and Mexico Cityhosteda regular-season game last year. After activists blasted the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences with the hashtag #OscarsSoWhite, the film industry made dramatic changes. According to NBC News, the ""'African-American Film Critics Association declared 2016 the best year forblacks in cinema'ever'.""While these are profound steps towards diversity and inclusion, there's a glaring omission. According to researchers at theUniversity of Southern California, ""'at least half or more of all cinematic, television, or streaming stories"" didn't portray a single Asian or Asian-American on screen.'""This ""yellow-out"" may be swept under the rug now, but mark my words, FB stock will change everything.Asian Markets Too Bigly for FB Stock to IgnoreAs InvestorPlace contributor Craig Adeyanju notes, the Facebook stock price is all about the numbers, and the numbers look amazing! Adeyanju writes that with ""Facebook on course to reach 2 billion users this year without China, the opportunities become bigger once China allows FB in its country again. Keep in mind that China currently has thelargest numberof internet users globally.""7 Stocks to Buy That Could Double by 2018He is so right - the number of China'sinternet usersexceed that of the U.S. by a more than 150% margin. Those are bigly consumers that FB stock desperately wants to tap into. But they're notthatdesperate. China is often overused as a justification for buying Facebook stock or any number of investments. However, just scale up the picture a bit and you'll see why Mark Zuckerberg is so excited.Themajorityof Earth's human population is Asian, period. Even if you were to open a ""heritage month"" for every race, color and creed in America, you would at most affect less than 5% of the world. Adding in the entire Latin American population would help, but the leverage would be less than Africa, and slightly more than Europe.An investment in Facebook stock is simply a recognition of a changing world. Unfortunately, few have this ability. For example,Princeton Universitydetailed evidence ofdiscrimination in academiadesigned to ""cull"" Asian student populations. In contrast, from the perspective of FB stock, these demographic trends are to be embraced, celebrated and ultimately, profited.Untapped Riches Still Available for Facebook StockI mentioned before that China is an overused argument. But when you drill deeper into the statistics, there's still a lot of gold for FB stock to mine. The perennial Asian powerhouse's internet penetration is just slightly above half the population. In contrast, the U.S. internet penetration is nearly 89%. That's the raw, low-hanging fruit from which Facebook stock can benefit.3 Reasons Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Will Keep Delivering in 2017But even in a place like Japan, where the internet penetration is more than 91%, there's still a viable opportunity for FB. As of the midway point of last year, there were26 million JapaneseFacebook subscribers. That's less than a 21% penetration rate for the company. Japan is actually an unheralded market: it has an incredibly educated, tech savvy population.In many ways, that's a better prospect for FB stock rather than activating developing or frontier markets because of the existing infrastructure.Click to EnlargeBut the really exciting potential is that when developing countries reach the next stage, FB can spark a global revolution. Asia's total Facebook penetration rate is less than 14% - just marginally better than Africa. That means that the company's future is in Asian hands.The North American market is near realistic capacity at 62%, while Latin America is not that far behind at 52%. Given the enormous economic growth in Asia, that's not a bad gig for FB stock.While the rest of the world is focused on the transition of power at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, Facebook has been looking at a trend decades in the making. Indeed, the movement is inevitable and will have far-reaching consequences well outside our lifetimes. They only thing any company can do is to prepare for it, and FB has a substantial lead.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 High-Yield Dividend Stocks That Are SOMEHOW Still Bargains10 Stocks to Buy to Survive a ""Trumpsy-Turvy"" 2017The postAsia Will Take Over the World, and Facebook Inc (FB) Wants Inappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Videogame Stock Roundup: Microsoft Reports Q2 Earnings, Nintendo Launches Pokemon Go in South Korea;1/27/2017;"Among the top stories this week, Microsoft Corp.MSFTreported second-quarter fiscal 2017 results. In a separate development, after almost a six-month delay, South Korean gamers can now enjoy Pokémon Go as NintendoNTDOYlaunched the game officially in the country.Meanwhile, Facebook IncFBzeroed in on Hugo Barra, an ex-Xiaomi executive to spearhead its VR initiatives.Recap of the Developments1. Microsoft's second-quarter fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings of 83 cents and revenues $26.07 billion easily beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Though gaming is a very small part of the company's business, Xbox is an important aspect of the overall video game industry. Microsoft's gaming revenues fell 3% (1% in constant currency). Xbox Live monthly active users were up 17% to 55 million. The company witnessed more than 26 billion hours of gameplay on Windows 10 PCs and tablets.The company's shares have surged 26% compared with the ZacksComputer-Softwareindustry's gain of 24.31% in the last one year.At present, Microsoft carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy)   stocks here.2. After a six-month delay, Nintendo has now officiallylaunchedits blockbuster hit game, Pokémon Go in South Korea, on both Alphabet'sGOOGLPlay Store and Apple Inc.'sAAPLiOS store. Per media reports, Nintendo's Pokémon Go works with Google Maps, which has ""limited access"" in South Korea. Niantic had earlier sought permission from the South Korean government for access to Korean maps, which was flatly refused. Google had not agreed to South Korean government's demand to ""blur"" sensitive locations like government buildings on Maps.Reportedly, the denial stemmed from the fact that South Korea remains concerned about its national security. It doesn't share warm ties with its neighbor, North Korea. The simmering border tension between the two nations has led the South Korean government to disallow storage of detailed maps of the country on any other servers except those in South Korea, add media reports.It remains unknown how Niantic, the firm which developed Pokémon Go, bypassed the Maps issue, add media reports. Niantic chose to remain silent on this issue during the press conference it held in Seoul on Jan 23, 2017.Nintendo carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The success of Pokémon Go helped the company's share price. Over the past one year, its shares are up 55.86% compared with ZacksToys/Games/ Hobby/Productsindustry's gain of 18.42%.3. Meanwhile, Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg in a post announced that ex-Xiaomi vice president, Hugo Barra will spearhead all the company's VR initiatives as well as the Oculus unit. Zuckerberg further added ""Hugo shares my belief that virtual and augmented reality will be the next major computing platform. They'll enable us to experience completely new things and be more creative than ever before. Hugo is going to help build that future, and I'm looking forward to having him on our team.""Facebook had acquired Oculus for $2 billion in 2014. With Oculus, the company is trying to fuel its ambitious AR/VR efforts. Zuckerberg has time and again mentioned that VR is the next big business opportunity. Facebook has been pumping ample resources to boost its VR efforts. A few days back, Zuckerberg said that Facebook was going to spend over $3 billion over the next 10 years.However, Oculus has beenslappedwith a $2 billion lawsuit filed by video game company, ZeniMax. Zuckerberg appeared in a Dallas courtroom to testify against the allegations. Apparently, Zuckerberg has denied all allegations and stressed that ""The idea that Oculus technology is based on someone else's is just wrong.""At present, Facebook has a Zacks Rank #2.  In the past one year, Facebook's shares have generated a return of 39.92%, compared with the ZacksInternet Servicesindustry's gain of 19.39%.PerformanceThe following table shows the price movement of the major video game companies over both the past five trading days as well as the last six months:CompanyLast 5 DaysLast 6 MonthsATVI1.34%-5.03%EA1.68%6.32%GLUU6.98%-3.77%MSFT2.50%13.23%NTES6.00%23.20%TTWO4.15%33.77%ZNGA-2.65%-10.76%Over the last five trading sessions, Glu Mobile IncGLUUwas up 6.98% whereas Zynga IncZNGAwas down 2.65%.Over the last six-month period, Take Two InteractiveTTWOsurged the most (33.77%). The company continues to benefit from its popular offerings like GrandTheft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online (though sales are slowing down), along with its other releases like NBA 2K17. In fact, higher sales of the digital version of the games add to the company's margins. The company continues to expect growth in digital revenues driven by higher sale of full game downloads and increases in recurrent consumer spending.Computer and Technology Sector 5YR % ReturnComputer and Technology Sector 5YR % ReturnZynga was down 10.76% over the same time frame. Slowdown in its user growth remains a major concern. Moreover, a slowing web business along with intensifying competition are added concerns. However, its cost cutting initiatives are a positive.

How Intel Corporation Can Strengthen Its Relationship With Apple Inc.;1/27/2017;"With theApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) iPhone 7, microprocessor giantIntel(NASDAQ: INTC) scored a lucky break, winning a significant   portion of the cellular modem orders for Apple's latest handsets   -- arguably the highest-profile smartphone win that Intel has   ever enjoyed.Image source: Apple.makeArticleAd();Intel cellular modem chips, branded the XMM 7360, are found   inside versions of the iPhone 7 devices used on networks that   don't implement the CDMA cellular standard. Chips from rivalQualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM) are found in the iPhone models used on CDMA   networks, as Intel's chips currently don't implement CDMA.Back in late 2015, Intel purchased the CDMA chipset assets   from a company called VIA Telecom,  presumably in a bid to   allow the former to build chips that could address the entirety   of Apple's cellular modem needs.Though Qualcomm is widely believed to build superior modems to   what Intel produces, Apple recently filed a lawsuit against   Qualcomm alleging, among other things, that ""Qualcomm has charged   Apple a monopolistic premium for access to CDMA chipsets that are   in all other aspects identical to chipsets sold to Apple without   CDMA functionality enabled. ... Qualcomm has used its monopoly   power in CDMA chipsets to obtain anticompetitive license and   chipset supply terms,"" the complaint filed on Jan. 20 read.I'll be writing more on the lawsuit in the coming days and   today there is an observation I would like to share regarding   Apple, Intel, Qualcomm, and CDMA iPhones.Apple's component costs could come down if Intel     succeeds in implementing CDMABased on this complaint, we now know that Qualcomm charges   Apple more for the same exact cellular modems with CDMA enabled   compared to versions without CDMA enabled. This isn't an unusual   practice in the semiconductor industry; companies like Intel   routinely charge more for identical chips but with certain   features enabled, compared with variants without those features   enabled. This is plain old product segmentation at work.Image source: Qualcomm.What's interesting is that Apple is complaining that, because   Qualcomm essentially has no viable competition for its   CDMA-enabled modems, it is charging a ""monopolistic premium.""The magnitude of this premium isn't clear, but it's clear that   Apple isn't happy about having to pay it, and therein lies the   opportunity for Intel.If Intel can develop a commercially viable LTE modem that also   supports CDMA (and is certified on all of the major CDMA   networks) using those VIA Telecom assets, then this would open   the door to a couple of possibilities:Intel could win more than just the non-CDMA iPhones. It     could be a true ""second source"" for all the iPhones that Apple     ships. This could potentially boost Intel's share at Apple, to     Intel's benefit (and to Qualcomm's detriment).Apple could be able to get cheaper CDMA modems from     Qualcomm. Even if Apple doesn't increase the proportion of     total modems that it purchases from Intel, the fact that Intel     and Qualcomm parts would be viable for all iPhone models could     help reduce the average price that Apple pays per cellular     modem.Net-net, Intel's becoming a stronger cellular modem provider   would mean that Apple should, in general, pay less for modems.   This could help modestly improve Apple's gross profit margin and,   ultimately, net profit.To put this into perspective, in the complaint, Apple says   that LTE modems sell for between $10 and $20. Let's suppose that   Apple must pay $15 for the non-CDMA Qualcomm chips and then $20   for the CDMA-capable Qualcomm chips -- though with the iPhone 7,   Apple doesn't appear to be buying any non-CDMA Qualcomm chips;   the non-CDMA iPhones now use Intel.If Apple can get that $20 figure down to $15 in the presence   of a viable alternative from Intel, then that's $5 saved across   potentially 100 million or more iPhone models sold in a year.   That $5 figure is for illustrative purposes only, as I have no   clue what the actual delta is, but multiplied across the volumes   that Apple sells, the savings Apple could potentially realize are   significant.Intel needs to executeThe key to all of this is for Intel to execute to building   increasingly competitive cellular modems. If Intel can, then   that's obviously a positive for Intel, as an opportunity to sell   more modems, and an opportunity for Apple, in the form of cheaper   modems.The loser, if Intel can supply more of Apple's volume --   whether or not it actually does -- would be Qualcomm, as at the   very least it could see the premium that it enjoys from the sale   of CDMA-capable LTE modems evaporate.In the scheme of things, though, losing a bit more Apple chip   business probably isn't going to sting Qualcommthatmuch. After all, Intel grabbed a bunch of iPhone share this   cycle, yet Qualcomm's chip business appears to be on theright track.10 stocks we like better than Wal-MartWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock   tip, it can pay to listen.

Should You Sell Qualcomm After Apple's $1 Billion Lawsuit?;1/26/2017;"Shares ofQualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM) plunged 13% on Jan. 23 after the chipmaker was   sued for $1 billion by one of its biggest customers,Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) . The lawsuit is related to the FTC's   separatelawsuit against Qualcomm, which alleges that the chipmaker leveraged its portfolio of   critical wireless patents to force its baseband competitors out   of the market. Let's take a closer look at this tangled   mess, and see if Qualcomm shareholders should sell their   shares.Image source: Apple.makeArticleAd();Why is Apple suing Qualcomm?Back in 2008,Sprintdeployed its first WiMax network, a 4G standard which wasn't   heavily dependent on Qualcomm's patent portfolio.Intel(NASDAQ: INTC) championed the use of WiMax chips, but   Qualcomm opposed WiMax in favor of its upcoming LTE standard --   which it could generate more licensing fees from.At the time, Apple considered launching an iPhone for WiMax   networks. Realizing that the move could hurt its LTE ambitions,   Qualcomm agreed to pay Apple ""rebates"" for sticking with its   baseband modems and waiting for its LTE standard instead. Those   rebate payments were dependent on Apple doing two things --exclusivelyusing Qualcomm's chips (from 2011 to 2016), and notinstigatingany litigation which accused the chipmaker of unfair   licensing practices. The FTC claims that Qualcomm essentially   ""bribed"" Apple with those rebates to prevent it from switching to   competing chipsets.Over the past two years, Qualcomm was hit with antitrust   probes worldwide, which all allege that it charges unfair   licensing fees for its 3G/4G technologies. It was fined $975   million in China, another $854 million in South Korea, and could   face up to $3 billion in additional fines in Europe and   Taiwan. Apple claims that because it cooperated with   authorities in Korea during the investigation, Qualcomm   retaliated by withholding $1 billion in rebate payments -- which   it's now suing to recover.The outcome is anyone's guess...The battle between Qualcomm and Apple will be a long and nasty   one, since it's dependent on many shifting variables. First, the   FTC lawsuit could be dropped if commissioner Maureen K.   Ohlhausen, a Republican who voted against charging Qualcomm that   was just appointed the acting chairwoman by the Trump   Administration, chooses not to follow through. If the case is   dropped, the rebates should remain a valid business arrangement;   but if it isn't, the rebates could be invalidated as ""bribes"" --   which may hurt both companies.Regardless of what happens with the FTC case, Apple   needs to prove that it didn't violate the two main conditions of   its rebate agreement by using Intel modems or aiding the Korean   FTC during its investigation. Apple doesn't deny aiding the KFTC   at all -- it recently told CNN that it was merely   ""responding truthfully to law enforcement agencies"" instead of   ""instigating"" litigation against Qualcomm.Meanwhile, Qualcomm must justify many of its opaque licensing   practices. Qualcomm charges royalties based on a device's   entire value, instead of just the chips in the device -- a   practice that was already blocked by Chinese regulators. It also   charges licensing fees on 3G/4G handsets which don't use any of   its chips, since  those devices still rely on its wireless   technologies -- although Apple argues that some of Qualcomm's   licensed patents don't actually cover those core technologies.   This means that Apple still pays Qualcomm fees on iPhones using   Intel modems (and also the Infineon modems it used in the past),   and that those fees are likely higher due to the lack of   rebates.Understanding the risks to QualcommIf Qualcomm loses its cases against Apple and other   regulators, it could be forced to change its entire licensing   model. That move would cause the QTL (licensing) business'   margins to wither and crush its earnings since the business   generates the lion's share of its profits.It could also jeopardize Qualcomm'splanned acquisitionofNXP Semiconductors(NASDAQ: NXPI) , which would make it the largest automotive   chipmaker in the world while expanding its patent portfolio. If   Qualcomm doesn't close that deal this year, its top line will   remain heavily exposed to the commoditization of the smartphone   market and seemingly endless challenges against its licensing   business.But should you sell Qualcomm?Qualcomm faces plenty of legal headwinds, but I believe that   the sell-off is a knee jerk reaction that has knocked the stock   down to irrational levels. Qualcomm now trades at 14 times   earnings, as opposed to the industry average of 22. It also pays   a forward yield of 3.4%, which is easily supported by a payout   ratio of 53%.As a Qualcomm shareholder, I'm certainly disappointed with   recent developments. But I don't plan to sell my shares unless   the litigation either derails the NXP deal or forces Qualcomm to   dramatically reduce its licensing fees. Until then, I'll still   consider Qualcomm a cheap (albeit riskier) dividend play with   solid growth prospects inadjacent marketslike connected cars, drones, and Internet of Things gadgets.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Qualcomm's Earnings Call Dominated By Apple Lawsuit;1/26/2017;"CEO Steve Mollenkopf. Image source: Qualcomm.Mobile chip giantQualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM) reported fiscal first-quarter results last night.   While the results as well as guidance mostly topped analyst   expectations,Apple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) recent lawsuit against the company expectedly   dominated the subsequent earnings call (""Apple"" was mentioned 74   times). For good reason, too, since Apple is widely considered   Qualcomm's largest customer, combined with the fact that the   lawsuit threatens Qualcomm's licensing model.makeArticleAd();Beyond a few brief statements, this is the first time that   Qualcomm has commented publicly and in granular detail regarding   the suit. Here's what management had to say.Prepared remarksCEO Steve Mollenkopf first noted that the two companies have   historically had a strong relationship, and Qualcomm intends to   ""remain a good supplier"" despite the legal complaint. The company   would naturally have preferred to settle its dispute with Apple   in private negotiations instead of litigation, but it remains   confident that it can defend itself in court. Mollenkopf summed   it up: ""Apple's complaint contains a lot of assertions, but in   the end, this is a commercial dispute over the price of   intellectual property. They want to pay less for the fair value   that Qualcomm has established in the marketplace for our   technology, even though Apple has generated billions in profits   from using that technology.""President Derek Aberle continued:Touching briefly on Apple's complaints filed in San Diego     and China, it claims that Qualcomm should be required to     license its cellular standard essential patents, or SEPs, to     modem suppliers. That even when licensing those patents at the     device level, Qualcomm should only be able to charge royalties     on the price of the cellular modem chip inside the device.These positions, however, are inconsistent with     long-standing industry practice, the [intellectual property     rights] policies of the relevant standard-setting bodies, the     realities of licensing large portfolios of patents, and basic     notions of efficiency, fairness in economics.Aberle points out that device-level licensing is utilized   throughout the industry by many major patent holders beyond   Qualcomm. (Apple is seeking chip-level licensing.) Qualcomm says   its patents also contribute to many other features in modern   smartphones beyond cellular connectivity, further justifying   device-level royalties. Shifting to chip-level royalties would   then introduce different layers of licensing for all the various   chips that Qualcomm enables or sells itself, so it licenses the   entire portfolio for the sake of efficiency.Apple says that there is no limit to the royalty rates, which   is why it seeks per-unit royalty relief in the form of ""rebate""   payments. Aberle says this is untrue:In addition, it is well known that Qualcomm has per-unit     running royalty caps as part of its licensing program. This     effectively results in licensees not paying running royalties     as a percentage of the device price above a certain net selling     price of any given device. Apple's claim that royalties are     uncapped is simply incorrect.Aberle also reiterated that Qualcomm believes Apple is   instigating these regulatory attacks as well as providing   inaccurate information:Apple claims that Qualcomm retaliated because Apple     cooperated with government investigations. To be clear, we did     no such thing. We simply objected to Apple making false and     misleading statements and withholding information to motivate     attacks against Qualcomm. We welcome the opportunity to have     Apple's claims heard in court, where we will be entitled to     full discovery of Apple's practices and a robust examination of     the merits. We will prove that Apple's irresponsible claims of     extortion are false.There should be no immediate impact to sales from the lawsuit,   either. Apple still needs modems, and Qualcomm will still supply   them. CFO George Davis said, ""We are not forecasting any impact   to revenues related to the dispute with Apple, as we are   continuing to meet their supply needs in good faith and expect   Apple will continue to meet its obligations.""Questions and answersAs usual, the analyst Q&A often provides more color.   Qualcomm affirmed that Apple does not have a direct license, but   rather an indirect license through its contract manufacturers.   Qualcomm isn't worried about collecting, said Aberle:Apple does not have a direct license with Qualcomm today.     And so the royalties on Apple products that get paid to     Qualcomm are reported and paid by their contract manufacturers.     So although we do have a dispute now with Apple and they are     challenging some of the offers and some of our licensing terms,     the contracts that we have in place with their suppliers remain     valid and enforceable. And we would expect that our licensees     will continue to comply with the terms of their agreements. And     we would also hope and expect that Apple would not interfere     with the terms of those agreements. But of course, we can't     fully control those actions.When asked about the exclusivity and monopoly power   allegations, general counsel Don Rosenberg (who incidentally used   to work for Apple a decade ago), downplayed the idea that   Qualcomm wields monopoly power:With regard to your question about so-called exclusivity     deal, first of all, we -- I think you called this monopoly     power or had monopoly power. We don't believe we have monopoly     power in the chip market or any other market. And nor do we     have an exclusivity arrangement. We have never prevented Apple     or anybody else from buying from competitive chipmakers. And in     the Apple case, it's pretty clear since, as you know, they have     been buying fromIntelfairly recently. So it's a mischaracterization to call it an     exclusive dealing arrangement.This is a little murky, since Applehadbeen exclusively buying basebands from Qualcomm for five years,   and only started buying from Intel after the alleged exclusivity   ended.Overall, Qualcomm thinks Apple is simply trying to finagle   lower payments -- lower being beneath fair value as established   by its hundreds of other licensing deals with many companies over   the years. That risks somewhat oversimplifying Apple's complaint,   because Apple is also accusing Qualcomm of various forms of   anticompetitive behavior. Whether or not those allegations stand   up in court remains to be seen.10 stocks we like better than QualcommWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

BlackBerry Ltd (BBRY) DTEK70: Game-Changer or Non-Event?;1/26/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe rumor mill is spinning again withBlackBerry Ltd(NASDAQ:BBRY). Code-named ""Mercury,"" the next BlackBerry device, DTEK70, will reportedly get a Feb. 25 launch date. And BBRY stock holders probably do not care at this point.makeArticleAd();Source:WEi WEi via FlickrBlackBerry is rebranding itself as a software company, but its stock is up a mere 4.3% in the last year. By comparison,Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) is up nearly 25% in the last year whileNokia Corp (ADR)(NYSE:NOK), which exited the Windows Phone market and focused on networking, fell 33%.Still, the DTEK70 release is important for BBRY.BlackBerry and TCL PartnershipBlackBerry outsourced its entire hardware development and manufacturing withTCL. Early signs are positive that ""Mercury"" will win customers, especially in the business space. BlackBerry said that it is 100% indevelopingsoftware solutions. TCL's ""Mercury"" build offers a secure Android operating system and has a physical keyboard. The company earns IP and royalty revenue for each device TCL sells.On its conference call in December, BlackBerrydescribedthe TCL deal:This licensing model allows BlackBerry to generate ongoing high margin royalty revenue from a device software based on the number of units sold. We have a pipeline of additional opportunities that are focusing on, including a late discussion in India that are ongoing.""Decent Price to PerformanceBlackBerry priced the budget DTEK50 in the right range but did not win the mainstream market. DTEK60 demonstrated the company's ability to make a solid, high-performance phone at mainstream prices. DTEK70 is even more practical for business users.Rumoredto run on aQualcomm, Inc.(NASDAQ:QCOM) Snapdragon 635 or Snapdragon 821, the device will have just 4.5 inches of screen real estate.5 Blue-Chip Stocks to Sell in FebruaryThis is the magic number for DTEK70: The device may sell for around just $350. At that price and size, business users who crave for higher productivity will snap up this phone when it is launched.Profit MarginBlackBerry CEO John Chen will not allow the company to sell devices at a loss. Assume profit margins in the range of 25%-50% for TCL. When the costs of software development are included, the profit margin for BBRY may run above 50%-60%.Launch DateOn its blog, BlackBerry said it will give more details about the smartphone at the Mobile World Congress show. The event runs from Feb. 27 to March 3.Interest in ""Mercury""+ ""BlackBerry"" jumped:Click to EnlargeSource:tickertags.comGame Changer or More of the Same?Past BlackBerry Android devices did not give the company much revenue growth. In the third quarter, the $172 million in software services revenue accounted for 57% of the company's revenue.The TCL licensing deal, though, is a game-changer for the software company. DTEK70's development costs are all shouldered by its partner. BlackBerry gets a cut in the sales through the software licensing. High profit margins from software sales will translate to more profits for the company.The one big catch is that BBRY and TCL must advertise and promote this upcoming device. BlackBerry made $12 million in operating income in the third quarter.Profit Model for DTEK 70Assuming TCL pays a 10% royalty on the profits of the $350 device, or $20 per device, BlackBerry could earn the following:Units Sold per quarterProfit100,000  $   2,000,000250,000$ 5,000,000 500,000  $ 10,000,000Selling 500,000 units a quarter would match the company's third-quarter operating income.3 Reasons to Buy Ford Motor Company (F) Stock on This DipBottom Line on BBRY StockThe smartphone market is still wide-open for small players like BlackBerry. Previously released Android devices demonstrated the company could deliver on supplying a highly secure, bug-free operating system. The inexpensive DTEK70 targets the business user.With the rumored price and phone specifications, BlackBerry may have an unexpected winner.As of this writing, Chris Lau was long BBRY.

Should You Buy Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock? 3 Pros, 3 Cons;1/26/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIf you bought and held stock inMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) at the height of the dot-com run, it's been an unpleasant 16 years. However, after a long wait, MSFT stock finally reached a new all-time high last month. Despite the tech world changing drastically in the ensuing years, Microsoft's PC dominance lives on, minting money for the company.makeArticleAd();Source:Mike Mozart Via FlickrThe company's various new efforts over the years have mostly been flops. There's a reason Microsoft stock has performed poorly; efforts such as Windows phones simply haven't panned out. However, it seems Microsoft has finally turned the corner.It is making real headway in several promising areas, including its cloud offering. And investors have cheered, sending Microsoft's stock up sharply since 2013. Can the good times continue, or will buyers up at these levels be in for another long decade?MSFT Stock ConsHuge Stock Run-Up: Since 2013, MSFT stock has more than doubled. At first glance, that seems fine, the market has performed strongly in recent years after all. However, Microsoft is so large, that it becomes hard to achieve further such doublings. With a market cap just under $500 billion today, even one more double takes Microsoft to a trillion dollar market cap. It's worth asking what the company has going from a growth perspective that could justify such a lofty figure.Sure, the company has some growth initiatives under way. The cloud offering is going well. And the LinkedIn acquisition may start to bear more fruit. But after watching the stock run from under 30 in recent years to over 60 today, you have to ask how much more upside really makes sense, particularly since the company has had near non-existent revenue growth lately.10 High-Yield Dividend Stocks That Are SOMEHOW Still BargainsHigh Valuation:First things first, MSFT stock isn't really trading at a 30 price-earnings ratio. I know that's what financial websites report. However, that's based on GAAP figures that include one-off losses related to restructuring. On an adjusted basis, Microsoft is trading in the mid-20s, and at 21 times forward earnings. However, even that doesn't paint a flattering picture for the company. Microsoft traded at 12 times earnings or less over much of the past decade. Is Microsoft worth paying twice as much for now?Sure, the PC market has stabilized, but it isn't likely to ever be a meaningful growth driver again. And the newer initiatives such as cloud seem likely to take years to reach strong profitability. At 21 times forward earnings, MSFT stock is pricing in some serious growth prospects that may well not materialize.Questionable Deal-Making:Microsoft has a reputation for making some head-scratching M&A moves. The less said of the aQuantive purchase and the Nokia buy, the better. Those two alone resulted in almost $14 billion of write-offs. And the recent LinkedIn deal raises questions. Microsoft paid $26 billion for LinkedIn, and offered a massive premium to where shares where trading previously. At the price Microsoft paid, it offered around 30x free cash flow for LinkedIn. On an earnings basis, LinkedIn was still losing money.Sure, Microsoft can cut some costs there, particularly for stock-based compensation, but it's still a massive price tag. And with Microsoft having such a huge war chest on its balance sheet, the temptation will surely be there for the company to make other huge value-destructive deals.MSFT Stock ProsPC Market Stabilizing:For quite a few years now, the traditional PC market appeared to be in serious decline. Sales peaked in 2011, with364 million unitssold that year globally. Since then, sales have plunged. By 2015, sales dropped 24% from that peak year, falling to just 275 million units. And 2016 showed another solid decline, with sales reaching just 260 million units. However, the worst may now have passed. 2020 projections are for 250 million units sold, only a fractional decline from current levels.And themost recent datasupports this further moderation: sales slipped just 1.5% versus the same period last year. And in several areas globally, including Canada and Japan, PC sales are actually increasing again. One possible reason, the rate of forward technological progress has slowed for both tablets and smartphones, reducing pressure on consumers to switch to smaller screens. A stable market would be great news for MSFT stock.Partnership With Qualcomm:Microsoft has partnered withQualcomm, Inc.(NASDAQ:QCOM) for their Internet of Things efforts. Qualcomm has entered conflict withIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) at first over the IoT market. In the longer-run, Qualcomm may use its chips to even forcefully attack Intel's long-held dominance in the PC market. In any case, Microsoft benefits nicely from partnering up with Qualcomm.The IoT offerings born from this venture will help spread Windows 10 outside of just the traditional PC market. And given the shellacking that QCOM stock took earlier this week followingApple Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AAPL) lawsuit against the firm, Qualcomm has reason to deepen ties with friendly partners. As an industry outcast, Qualcomm needs whatever help it can get, and if Microsoft can use that to expand Windows as a broader OS, all the better.Solid Dividend Option:Microsoft has quietly turned into a nice yield choice for more conservative investors. The company has tripled its dividend since 2008. In total, it's posted 16%, 18% and 16% dividend growth rates over the past three, five and ten years. While the payout ratio currently looks a little high, that's based on abnormally soft recent earnings. Make no mistake, there is plenty of room left here for more dividend increases. The company has an astounding $137 billion in cash on its balance sheet. Even after subtracting out debt, the company has a net cash position of $62 billion, leaving plenty of firepower for increased dividends, share buybacks or acquisitions.VerdictMSFT stock is a decent selection if you're purely concerned with its yield and safety. The company's main PC business is looking healthier than it has in quite awhile. The balance sheet is tremendous. The dividend is significant at today's level, and is bound to keep rising quickly.Here's Why Chevron Corporation (CVX) Stock Is the Best Play in OilHowever, there's little to recommend Microsoft on valuation. The stock is expensive, even when you look closely. Microsoft has plenty of growth initiatives in the works, but actual operating results recently have only been so-so. When buying stocks at all-time highs, you want to see a business with more operating momentum.At the time of this writing, Ian Bezek held INTC and QCOM stock. He had no position in Microsoft.

"Can Apple's (AAPL) ""Find my Airpod"" Feature Really Help?";1/26/2017;"On TuesdayApple Inc. (AAPL)announced its iOS 10.3 update with a special feature, apparently called ""Find my Airpods"", that will help to track misplaced Airpods.Powered by a new W1 chip, the Airpods are in line with Apple's vision of wireless future. Apparently, its best feature seems to be the use of sensors to detect if the plugs have been inserted in both the ears. However, since its launch, Airpod has been a hot topic of discussion on FacebookFBand TwitterTWTRgiven the chances of it being misplaced easily due to its size.Per media reports, Apple's announcement can be seen as an answer to users' request to make a feature that will help them find these small AirPods. Due to its small size, the Airpod cannot accommodate a built-in GPS system. Therefore, the latest feature is tailored to locate misplaced Airpods that are within the Bluetooth range of an iPhone or iPad.Then again, the problem remains that the exact location of the Airpod cannot be determined with the feature and only the last connected location will show up on the connected iOS device, add further media reports. Additionally, the feature is capable of activating a sound from the Airpod to indicate its location. However, these features are useless once the Airpod's battery is exhausted.Apple Inc. Price and ConsensusApple Inc. Price and Consensus|Apple Inc. QuoteApple's fortunes have been tied to its most important offering, the iPhone, which alone contributed about 60% of its total revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016.However, since the last two quarters, the demand for this device has been soft owing to global macroeconomic weakness, especially due to currency volatility and declining commodity prices in some key regions across the globe (about 60% of Apple revenues come from International markets).The Airpod had been one of the key attractions of the iPhone 7 series. Reportedly, since the launch of Airpods in December, Apple has been on the top of the headphone market that boasts names likes SonySNE, Bose, JBL and others. Although Apple has refrained from posting its official sales figures, the market reports indicate positive impact of Airpod sales on first quarter results.In the past one year, Apple's shares are up 19.98%, compared with the ZacksComputer Miniindustry's increase of 21.41%, as of Jan 24.Zacks' Best Private Investment IdeasIn addition to the recommendations that are available to the public on our website, how would you like to follow all Zacks' private buys and sells in real time?Our experts cover all kinds of trades… from value to momentum . . . from stocks under $10 to ETF and option moves . . . from stocks that corporate insiders are buying up to companies that are about to report positive earnings surprises.

Broadcom, Valeant Pharmaceuticals, Apple, Amazon and Netflix highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day Broadcom, Valeant Pharmaceuticals, Apple, Amazon and Netflix highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day;1/26/2017;"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL - January 26, 2017-Zacks Equity ResearchhighlightsBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO-Free Report)as the Bull of the Day andValeant Pharmaceuticals (NYSE:VRX-Free Report)as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis onApple (NASDAQ:AAPL-Free Report),Amazon(NASDAQ:AMZN-Free Report) andNetflix(NASDAQ:NFLX-Free Report).Here is a synopsis of all four stocks:Bull of the Day:Seems it was only a month ago I writing aboutBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO-Free Report)as the Bull of the Day and explaining why I've been strongly recommending and trading the stock since 2014 from $70.makeArticleAd();And it's true. I did choose AVGO on December 22 when it was trading around $180. Here's how I described this powerhouse technology company in that report...3 Key SegmentsThough Broadcom is generally classified as a semiconductor designer and developer, its solutions serve telecom and enterprise networking customers in the build-out of data centers and high-speed, broadband communications. I can't say for sure ifAT&T,CiscoorAlphabetare customers, but I would be surprised if they weren't.Thus about half of Broadcom's sales come from the Wired Infrastructure segment which has been seeing steady double-digit growth as these big customers transition to the 100 Gigabit Ethernet protocol.Approximately 30% of Broadcom's revenues come from its Wireless Communications division which serves top-end mobile smart-device makers likeApplewith radio frequency (RF) chips, amplifiers, and FBAR technology filters. Broadcom FBAR (Film Bulk Acoustic Resonator) filters are a form of bulk acoustic wave (BAW) filter that have superior performance with steeper rejection curves compared to surface acoustic wave (SAW) filters.The third major segment at Broadcom is Enterprise Storage, which connects back with many customers from the Wired division and supplies just under 20% of revenues. The company's products enable the high-speed movement of digital data with a secure connection among multiple PCs, servers and storage devices such as hard disk drives and solid state drives.While AVGO's Wireless business is ""dependent"" on Apple, that's not exactly a bad problem to have. The coming next wave of 5G technology will keep both companies rolling in sales growth.And Broadcom's largest business, the Wired segment, is very busy meeting the demand of companies building high-speed, broadband networks, especially with the data-hogging loads of video and the storage requirements of the Internet of Things.Bear of the Day:I don't enjoy kicking this once-beloved company when it's down, butValeant Pharmaceuticals (NYSE:VRX-Free Report)has it coming (again) as earnings estimates slip.In the past week, another investment bank revised lower their EPS projection for this year, knocking the the Zacks Consensus down to $5.17 from $5.30.And in the past 90 days, the profit outlook has fallen from $7.70. This puts annual growth at -5.6% after a 2016 that could end up at over -30% ""growth.""This is why VRX shares are in the cellar of the Zacks Rank again.But it doesn't mean you should run out and sell yours only $1 from multi-year lows. The company is still projected to deliver nearly $9.2 billion in sales this year with hundreds of products and steady earners like Jublia and Wellbutrin.The unknown risks are what happens with any legal investigations or the company's massive debt load. The current debt-to-equity ratio is over 7X for this $4.7 billion company and the debt-to-capital ratio may be over 87X.Analysts Weigh In On the Debt IssueOn January 11, Canaccord Genuity analyst Neil Maruoka was encouraged by Valeant's recent moves to address the leverage...""Valeant has taken its first significant steps towards de-levering its balance sheet, announcing the divestiture of Dendreon and several dermatology brands (including CereVe) for combined cash consideration of ~$2.1 billion.""The analyst noted that the downside of this move is that the company may be forced to sell more quality drug franchises like CereVe, thus hurting sales and operating cash flow. ""Following these divestitures, we estimate that Valeant will have total debt of $28.3 billion remaining, representing a leverage ratio of 6.9x forward EBITDA (down from 7.1x previously).""On January 20, Deutsche Bank reiterated their Hold rating on VRX shares and dropped their price target from $24 to $20. Analyst Gregg Gilbert talked about the company's challenges...""We expect VRX to provide its 2017 outlook sometime between now and when it reports 4Q results (date not yet set). Recall that management provided 'hand signals' on its 3Q call in November that revenue and EBITDA would be down in 2017 vs. 2016. In anticipation of this event, we have updated our model to reflect recent developments and management commentary. The key elements of our changes relate to recently-announced divestitures, loss of exclusivity (LOE) for several products in 2016/17, and FX headwinds.""Additional content:Apple 'Hopeful' About Future iPhone Manufacturing in     IndiaOn Wednesday,Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL-Free Report)executives met with government officials of India to discuss plans about manufacturing iPhones in the country.Like many tech corporations-think Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN-Free Report) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX-Free Report) - Apple is eager to begin assembling its iPhone in India, which has become one of the world's fastest growing smartphone markets in recent years. Apple currently only has a tiny market share in the country, and is ready to start bolstering its stagnate global sales. The company even applied to open retail stores in India last year.""We've been working hard to develop our operations in India,"" Apple said in a brief statement. ""We appreciate the constructive and open dialogue we've had with government about further expanding our local operations.""The tech giant's plans to set up an iPhone production plant was initially reported on byTimes of India. The newspaper reported that the factory would be built in partnership with Taiwan-based manufacturer Wistron.According toCNNMoney, India has over 300 million smartphone users, or 18% more than last year. Apple, then, has much to gain if it can build a successful iPhone production plant in the country. However, Apple's products are not cheap, and most of India's 1.3 billion people have an average annual income of $1,500.Zacks' Top 10 Stocks for 2017In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest tickers for the entirety of 2017?Who wouldn't?

Facebook Inc (FB) Hires Former Google Exec to Lead Oculus;1/26/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFacebook Inc's(NASDAQ:FB) virtual reality division Oculus has had a rough six months, but it looks as though the company is ready to to push VR in 2017 and turn things around. CEO Mark Zuckerberg took to Facebook last night to announce thatHugo Barra will be joining FB to lead VR efforts, including Oculus. If the name sounds familiar it should. Barra is very well known in the technology industry.makeArticleAd();Source: FacebookSo who is Hugo Barra? He was in the news just last week when it was revealed he was leaving Chinese consumer technology giantXiaomi.He was hired in 2013 to lead that company's efforts to polish its image in western markets and help push its products into the U.S. market. At the time Barra said he was returning to his Silicon Valley roots, but gave no details.What Does Hugo Barra Bring to FB?Prior to Xiaomi, he served asAlphabet Inc's(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google vice president of Android product management.In his announcement of Barra's hire, Zuckerberg wrote:""I'm excited that Hugo Barra is joining Facebook to lead all of our virtual reality efforts, including our Oculus team. Hugo's in China right now, so here we are together in VR. It seems fitting.I've known Hugo for a long time, starting when he helped develop the Android operating system, to the last few years he's worked at Xiaomi in Beijing bringing innovative devices to millions of people. Hugo shares my belief that virtual and augmented reality will be the next major computing platform.""FB's Oculus ChallengesWhen Facebook bought Oculus for $2 billion in 2014, the prospects for its new virtual reality division seemed limitless. But for the last six months, the division has been struggling.10 Stocks to Buy to Survive a ""Trumpsy-Turvy"" 2017Founder Palmer Luckey was bringing inbad press over his political views, complaints over the highprices for its Oculus Rift headsetand the new Touch Controllers continued, andSony Corp (ADR)(NYSE:SNE) unexpectedly began to gain traction with both consumers and game developers with its much more affordable Playstation VR. In December, Oculus CEO Brendan Iribe stepped down. Now, FB and Luckey aretied up in a lawsuitclaiming the Oculus founder stole trade secrets and violated copyrights in order to develop his Oculus Rift VR headset.On top of all this, the hype over virtual reality is beginning to fade. After being a major part of past Consumer Electronics shows, there was a feeling thatVR wasn't particularly compelling at CES 2017.In short, it's understandable why FB wants to kickstart Oculus. An industry veteran like Hugo Barra -someone who is experienced in leading a critical division in a technology giant and skilled at promotion - may well be the answer.Kickstarting OculusWhen Barra takes over at Oculus, there are a few immediate challenges to take on. The lawsuit will have to be dealt with, but FB lawyers will be able to manage most of that.The bigger issue in terms of getting consumers to buy into the Oculus rift is pricing. The Oculus Rift already has mindshare as the VR headset people think of. But where the Oculus Rift was once pretty much the only game in town, every major consumer technology company - exceptApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) - is offering virtual reality gear, and it's almost always cheaper.Apple Inc. New iPads Might Be Late to the Party (AAPL)That wouldn't be such a big deal if you were looking at $100 versus $75. But an Oculus Rift plus Touch Controllers goes for $798. Then you need a reasonably powerful PC (many computer owners would have to upgrade), which is at least another $1,000. In comparison, a complete Sony Playstation VR system (including the PS4) can be had for about $800. However, the Playstation VR headset is compatible with the original PS4 - which many gamers already own, so that brings their investment to just $500.Largely as a result of those cost differences, it'sestimated Sony will have sold over 745,000 Playstation VR systems in 2016, while projections are for the Oculus Rift to hit just 355,000.The hire of Hugo Barra sets the stage for FB to aggressively promote the technical superiority of its Oculus virtual reality technology over that used by competitors like Sony. It's also a good move in promoting developer relations in an effort to boost the Oculus' lead in compelling VR content. And if he can find some wiggle room to get Oculus Rift pricing down a bit, Barra stands a good chance of turning things around for Facebook's virtual reality division in 2017.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace3 Things Apple Inc.

Apple (AAPL) Q1 Earnings: What's in the Cards this Time?;1/26/2017;"Apple, Inc.AAPLis set to report its first-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Jan 31. Last quarter, it posted a 0.60% positive earnings surprise. The company has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 0.11%.Let's see how things are shaping up prior to the announcement.Factors to ConsiderInvestors will be looking forward to sales numbers for iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. iPhone continues to the primary revenue contributor for Apple. Slowdown in the demand for iPhone has emerged as a big concern for Apple. Over the past one year, sales have dipped given overall weakness in the smartphone market, observe analysts. Per analysts, waning demand from markets like China and U.S., which are Apple's biggest markets, has been widely reflected on iPhone sales numbers.Also, competition from local players has been hindering iPhone growth in China. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, Apple iPhone unit sales came in at about 45.5 million, down 5% year over year. Revenues from iPhone also declined 13% from the year-ago quarter to $28.2 billion (60% of total revenue).Plus analysts also observe that the hype surrounding iPhone 8 will also dent sales. iPhone 8 is set to be launched later this year, marking the tenth anniversary of the revolutionary iPhone. It reportedly has amazing features like a glass body, a dual curved edge-to-edge OLED display with a built-in Touch ID sensor and wireless charging. What is more exciting is that Apple is rumored to launch three iPhones (instead of two) including a new 5.8 inch model. All this is likely to put consumers on hold for some more time. iPhone 8 is already dubbed as a ""super cycle"".However, given the troubles in iPhone, Apple has been focused on other drivers like Services, Music and App store to boost revenues. A few days back, Apple announced that its App Store generated sales of more than $20 billion for developers in 2016, up 40% from 2015.  Apple keeps 30% of all App Store sales. Apple stated that its top grossing markets were the U.S., China, Japan. China witnessed growth of over 90% year over year.Apple also announced that Apple Music has crossed 20 million paid users. Apple's Services business is also expected to remain strong as it is mostly dependent on the already installed Apple devices.Plus, it continues to increase focus on emerging markets to boost iPhone sales. In the last few months, Apple has increased its focus on India, which is expected to become the second largest smartphone market in the world. In fiscal 2016, Apple sales in India grew approximately 50% over the prior fiscal. Also, a robust cash position and shareholder friendly policies are long-term positives.For the first quarter of fiscal 2017, Apple forecasts revenues in a range of $76 billion to $78 billion.Gross margin is expected within 38% to 38.5%, while operating expenses are projected within $6.9 billion to $7 billion. Other income/ (expense) is likely to be $400 million, while tax rate is expected to be 26%.Apple Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseApple Inc. Price and EPS Surprise|Apple Inc. QuoteEarnings Whispers?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Apple will beat earnings estimates this season. This is because a stock needs to have both a positiveEarnings ESPand a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Apple has an Earnings ESP of -0.93% as the Most Accurate Estimate is $3.19 while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged higher at $3.22. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with ourEarnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank:Apple's Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or # 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a couple of stocks worth considering that, as per our model, have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Western Digital CorporationWDCwith an Earnings ESP of +12.73% and a Zacks Rank #1.

"Western Digital (WDC) Beats Q2 Earnings; '17 View Positive";1/26/2017;"Western Digital Corp.WDCreported second-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of $2.30 per share, which increased 33.7% from the year-ago quarter. Earnings were much better than management's revised guided range of $2.10-$2.15 per share.makeArticleAd();Moreover, including stock-based compensation, earnings were $1.98 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 33 cents. Further, revenues of almost $4.89 billion surged 47.4% year over year and comfortably surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.75 billion.Western Digital witnessed strong demand for both hard drive and NAND-based products from all categories of customers, largely driven by cloud and mobility based applications, as well as better than expected PC demand in the reported quarter.Western Digital Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS     SurpriseWestern Digital Corporation Price, Consensus and   EPS Surprise|Western Digital Corporation QuoteSegment Revenue DetailsClient devices (49.5% of total revenue) surged 52.9% year over year to $2.42 billion. The revenue synergies from SanDisk acquisition benefitted results in the quarter. Management noted that increasing storage capacities in mobile phones and market preference for client SSDs are long-term tailwinds for this business.Client solutions (22% of total revenue) increased a whopping 134.4% to $1.08 billion. Robust holiday season sales drove results. The company noted that the combined revenue contribution from new products such as iXpand and dual USB drives also grew in the quarter.During the quarter, Western Digital announced new retail products including the four terabyte My Passport, eight terabyte My Book for the PC and a new four terabyte hard drive for Apple'sAAPLMacintosh. During the quarter, Western Digital commenced retail shipments and OEM sampling of its 64-layer product.Data center devices and solutions (28.5% of total revenue) increased 9.2% to $1.39 billion on the back of strong demand for high capacity storage devices. Petabyte growth of almost 40% year over year for capacity optimized hard drive was in line with management expectations. Solid adoption of 10 Terabyte third generation Helium drive was also noted in the quarter.During the quarter, Western Digital shipped 44.8 million HDDs at an average selling price (ASP) of $62, up from $61 reported in the year-ago quarter. However, reported shipments of 44.762 million were down from 49.688 million in the year-ago quarter.Western Digital's market share in the total addressable market (TAM) came in at 39.9% compared with 43.2% in the year-ago quarter.Operating DetailsAdjusted gross margin expanded 810 basis points (bps) year over year to 36.4%. The figure was better than management's guidance of 35%. The expansion was driven by lower product cost and pricing improvement.Reported operating expenses, as percentage of revenues climbed 50 bps to 20.2%, owing to 20 bps increase in research and development (R&D) expense and 10 bps growth in selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense.As a result, adjusted operating margin expanded 590 bps to 17.6% in the reported quarter.Interest expense was $224 million a massive increase from $7 million reported in the year-ago quarter.Acquisition SynergiesWestern Digital stated that it is on track to achieve the $800 million of annualized savings from the HGST integration by the end of calendar 2017. The company achieved $175 million of cost of revenue synergies and $300 million of operating expense synergies each on an annual run rate basis at the end of the reported quarter.In terms of SanDisk integration, at the end of second quarter the company realized synergies of approximately $135 million on an annual run-rate basis. This is in line with the company's 18-month target of achieving $500 million of total run rate synergies on an annualized basis.Balance Sheet/Cash FlowAs of Dec 30, 2016, cash and cash equivalents were $4.94 billion up from $4.33 billion as of Sep 30. Long-term debt during the quarter was $12.94 billion down from $13.06 billion at the end of previous quarter.During the quarter, Western Digital generated $1.06 billion in cash from operations compared with $440 million in the previous quarter.GuidanceFor third-quarter fiscal 2017, revenues are expected to remain flat on a sequential basis.Adjusted gross margin is expected to be 38% backed by continued favorable pricing and product mix across the company's businesses. Total operating expenses are expected to be approximately $800 million.Interest expense is anticipated to be almost $205 million.Management expects adjusted earnings to be in the range of $2.00-$2.10 per share for the third quarter.Our TakeWe believe that the shift toward non-PC applications, secular growth of digital data and growing exposure to the small and medium business space are the long-term positives for Western Digital. The company's growing footprint in the automotive as well as the connected home and industrial categories is significantly positive, in our view.We remain encouraged by the company's launch of a string of storage devices under the mobile and cloud segment. Continued investments in product innovation could result in flattish margins in the near term.Further, Western Digital's entry into the wireless devices market comes at a time when storage services related to smartphones and tablets are witnessing large-scale adoption. These factors are anticipated to be growth catalysts, going forward.Moreover, the SanDisk acquisition not only expands Western Digital's offerings in the SSD segment but also provides a competitive edge against peers such as Seagate TechnologySTX.We note that Western Digital shares have outperformed the ZacksComputer Storage Devicesindustry in the past one-year. While shares gained 80.9%, the industry advanced 22.4% in the same period. We expect the momentum to persist given the impressive result and positive guidance in the rest of fiscal 2017.Zacks Rank & Key PicksWestern Digital currently has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Bull of the Day: Broadcom (AVGO);1/26/2017;"makeZacksArticleAd();Seems it was only a month ago I writing aboutBroadcom (AVGO)as the Bull of the Day and explaining why I've been strongly recommending and trading the stock since 2014 from $70.And it's true. I did choose AVGO on December 22 when it was trading around $180. Here's how I described this powerhouse technology company in that report...3 Key SegmentsThough Broadcom is generally classified as a semiconductor designer and developer, its solutions serve telecom and enterprise networking customers in the build-out of data centers and high-speed, broadband communications. I can't say for sure ifAT&T(T),Cisco(CSCO), orAlphabet(GOOGL) are customers, but I would be surprised if they weren't.Thus about half of Broadcom's sales come from the Wired Infrastructure segment which has been seeing steady double-digit growth as these big customers transition to the 100 Gigabit Ethernet protocol.Approximately 30% of Broadcom's revenues come from its Wireless Communications division which serves top-end mobile smart-device makers likeApple (AAPL)with radio frequency (RF) chips, amplifiers, and FBAR technology filters. Broadcom FBAR (Film Bulk Acoustic Resonator) filters are a form of bulk acoustic wave (BAW) filter that have superior performance with steeper rejection curves compared to surface acoustic wave (SAW) filters.The third major segment at Broadcom is Enterprise Storage, which connects back with many customers from the Wired division and supplies just under 20% of revenues. The company's products enable the high-speed movement of digital data with a secure connection among multiple PCs, servers and storage devices such as hard disk drives and solid state drives.While AVGO's Wireless business is ""dependent"" on Apple, that's not exactly a bad problem to have. The coming next wave of 5G technology will keep both companies rolling in sales growth.And Broadcom's largest business, the Wired segment, is very busy meeting the demand of companies building high-speed, broadband networks, especially with the data-hogging loads of video and the storage requirements of the Internet of Things.I Have $250... Do I Hear $300?So what has changed in a month to make Broadcom the Bull of the Day again?Simply this: the stock took off over 10% to new highs in the past six sessions as a couple of analysts bolstered their view of this must-own tech ""arms dealer."" While I've been following fund managers into AVGO for nearly 3 years, the growth story is not over.On January 18, RBC Capital analyst Amit Daryanani reiterated his Top Pick rating on AVGO shares and raised his view of the company's long term earnings potential to $17 EPS on the heels of the acquisition of Brocade (BRCD). Here's what he had to say...""Our analysis suggests the underlying EPS power of AVGO increases materially post BRCD (especially assuming they raise $1.5-2.0B from networking & real estate sales). We think AVGO could achieve >$17.00 of EPS by FY19 (prior $16) and the stock should work in an upside scenario to $250+.""Oddly, the analyst did not raise his existing price target from $200.So we'll leave that to a bolder fan of the company...On January 24, Morgan Stanley analyst Craig Hettenback raised his price target on Broadcom to $240 from $210, and obviously reiterated his Overweight rating. Here's the MS view...""Increasing our PT to $240 from $210 and highlighting a bull case valuation of $300. Our PT is based on a 15X P/E on CY18 EPS, representing a turn increase from the current multiple but still a conservative 20% discount to the high end Semiconductor peers and 15% below the market. AVGO's multiple has been flat (100% of stock appreciation has been driven by growth in EPS) compared to a roughly 2x turn increase in semiconductor stocks, with investors unwilling to pay up for acquired growth.""However, we now have increased conviction that clearer focus on its outperforming core business, materially higher cash returns and ongoing margin expansion will drive a re-rating over the next 6-12 months.""The combination of Avago and Broadcom is unmatched in Networking (40% sales) in our view, which has positive implications for both growth (share gains) and profitability. We also think the company remains well positioned in RF to exploit the next growth driver of carrier aggregation, leveraging its leadership in premium filters and multiplexers.""The AVGO CampaignAnd there you have an update on the continuing saga that I call ""The AVGO Campaign."" It tells you what works and makes you money in a bull market: finding earnings momentum winners that you know institutions will continue to buy until the cycle ends.Consider AVGO your ""playbook stock"" for how to use the Zacks Rank to swing trade fundamentally-strong companies quarter after quarter.You can find out more by following me in myTAZR Traderservice.Zacks' best stocks under $10As a Zacks Rank #1 Strong Buy, today's Bull of the Day has a short-term 1 to 3-month profit zone.

3 Big Tech Companies About to Report Earnings;1/25/2017;"Earnings season is well under way, and some big tech names are   up next. In the coming days, investors will watchAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) ,Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) , andFacebook(NASDAQ: FB) report results for their most recently ended   quarters. With market capitalizations in the hundreds of billions   of dollars, investors all over the world will be watching   closely. Ahead of their earnings releases, here's a brief   overview of some keys areas to watch.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();Alphabet: How about that new Google-branded     hardware?With its fourth quarter including the launch of some important   new Google-branded hardware, investors should look for an update   from management on how the products performed during the quarter.   In October, Alphabet launched its Google Pixel smartphone and a   Google Home voice-activated smart speaker. Yes, the bulk of the   company's revenue will still come from its search and advertising   business, but a high-performing hardware could signal growth   potential.On average, analysts are expecting Alphabet to report   fourth-quarter revenue and non-GAAP EPS of $25.18 billion and   9.64, respectively. These results would be up 18% and 11%   compared to the year-ago quarter.Alphabet reports results after market close on Thursday, Jan.   26.Beyond looking to Alphabet's Google-branded hardware and the   company's financial results, investors may want to take the time   to look atthe trajectory of the company's paid clicks and   cost per click-- two important metrics for Alphabet's core search business.iPhone 7. Image source: Apple.Apple: Will guidance point to growth or     decline?When Apple reports results for its first fiscal quarter of   2017 (or the fourth calendar quarter of 2016), one key area to   watch will be the company's guidance. While Apple is expecting   its first-quarter revenue to be slightly higher than in the   year-ago quarter, ending an unfortunate streak of three quarters   of year-over-year declines, it's not clear whether the company   can sustain growth throughout fiscal 2017.Analysts are expecting Apple to report first-quarter revenue   and EPS of $77.4 billion and $3.22. This compares to revenue and   EPS of $75.9 billion and $3.28 in the year-ago quarter.Apple reports its financial results after market close on   Tuesday, Jan. 31.To get a closer look at the metrics that will matter when   Apple reports first-quarter results, here's a more comprehensiveearnings preview.Facebook: Is revenue growth about to slow?The key thing for Facebook investors to watch when the world's   largest social network reports fourth-quarter results will be the   degree to which revenue growth decelerates. Facebook CFO David   Wehner has been warning that revenue growth rates are going to   begin coming down. Of course, with revenue increasing a whopping   56% year over year in Facebook's third quarter, even a meaningful   deceleration in its fourth quarter will still likely represent   big growth for the company.Image source: The Motley Fool.Analysts are looking for Facebook to report revenue and   non-GAAP EPS of about $8.49 billion and $1.31, up about 45% and   66%, respectively. Therefore, analysts do expect Facebook's   business growth to decelerate, but not too significantly.Facebook reports fourth-quarter results after market close on   Wednesday, Feb. 1.For a more in-depth overview of what to expect from Facebook's   earnings report, check out thisearnings preview.Stay tuned at The Motley Fool for more coverage of these   companies throughout earnings season.Find out why Facebookis one of the 10 best stocks to buy nowMotley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more   than a decade beating the market.

Qualcomm (QCOM) Earnings: Why QCOM Stock Is A Buy;1/25/2017;"Shares of Qualcomm (QCOM) are edging lower in the after-market session Wednesday, down about 1.3% even though the wireless chip giant reported fiscal first quarter earnings beat Wall Street estimates. Despite the bottom-line miss, it’s tough to ignore the potential value QCOM stock presents.Indeed, Qualcomm is facing some battles. Still, I would place a bet here on QCOM shares, which are priced at just 12 times fiscal 2017 estimates of $4.74 per share. Trading in the after-hour session at around $55, QCOM stock should reach $62 to $65 in the next 12 to 18 months delivering 18% returns. And the gains could go higher assuming its legal battle with Apple (AAPL) gets resolved, as I expect it will.The company’s guidance, for instance, underscores the extent to which the management remains focus on execution. For the second quarter, Qualcomm is forecasting adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $1.15 to $1.25. This compares favorably toThomson Reuters forecast of about $1.20 a share. This make Qualcomm — from a valuation perspective — easy to like at current levels. I’ll get back to that in a moment. Let’s go through he numbers.makeArticleAd();Forthe quarter that ended December, the San Diego-based company reported a net income of $700 million, or 46 cents a share, down from $1.5 billion, or 99 cents a share, a year earlier. On an adjusted basis, when taking out one-time gains and costs, the company would have earned $1.19 a share, which beat analysts estimates by a penny. First quarter revenue rose 4% year over year to $6 billion, but fell shy on estimates of $6.12 billion.“We are pleased with the strong start to our fiscal year and the year-over-year earnings growth across both our semiconductor and licensing businesses,” said CEO Steve Mollenkopf in a staement. “Looking ahead, the pending NXP acquisition accelerates our strategic transformation in the high growth areas of automotive, IoT, security and networking. We are very well positioned to lead as the semiconductor engine for the intelligent, connected world.”Revenue in the licensing business (Qualcomm Technology Licensing (QTL)), which sells sells applications processors and cellular baseband devices, grew 13% year over year to $1.8 billion, while QCT revenue, which exists to monetize Qualcomm immense IP portfolio, came in at $4.1 billion. These gains offset revenue in Mobile station modem (MSM) chip shipments, which includes the Snapdragon LTE modem, which declined 10% year over year $217 million.Ahead of the quarter, analysts were also looking to see if the company discusses its $38 billion purchase of Dutch chipmaker NXP Semiconductor (NXPI). Qualcomm said it expects the transaction — subject to regulatory approval — to close by the end of 2017. What’s more, the company said during the quarter,  $1.2 billion was returned to shareholders through a combination of buybacks and dividends."

Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Q2 Earnings Preview;1/25/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) stock has had an impressive run over the past few years. Heading into Thursday's fiscal second quarter earnings report, MSFT stock is right near an all-time high, having increased about 150% over the past few years.Source:Via MicrosoftWhat's interesting about the gains for such a large stock - MSFT is the third-most valuable company on U.S. markets, behind onlyApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) andAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL) - is that they haven't been based on Microsoft earnings. Microsoft's EPS was $2.73 in fiscal 2012, and $2.79 in fiscal 2016.makeArticleAd();Rather, the multiple investors assign to MSFT stock has expanded. It has more than doubled, in fact.That multiple expansion has come from increasing confidence toward Microsoft'sfutureearnings potential, most notably in mobile and cloud. Where investors four to five years ago saw a fading giant whose earnings were likely to decline, Microsoft now looks like a sleeping giant. And investors clearly believe the company's self-described ""mobile first, cloud first"" strategy is going to push Microsoft earnings up - at some point.It's in that context that the market will analyze the Microsoft earnings report due on Thursday.Microsoft's Growth Isn't There…YetIt's always dangerous for an investor to believe that the numbers don't matter, but in the case of MSFT stock, the numbers really aren't the most important thing right now.10 Stocks to Buy to Survive a ""Trumpsy-Turvy""     2017Analyst consensus - informed in large part by Microsoft earnings guidance - doesn't predict a particularly impressive second quarter earnings report. The Street expects EPS to rise just a penny year-over-year, which given share repurchases, implies that Microsoft's total net profits actually will be lower in Q2 FY17 than they were ago.  Revenue is estimated to fall almost 2% year-over-year.Microsoft's guidance projects growth in its Productivity & Business and Intelligent Cloud segments, but a sharp decline in More Personal Computing.That shouldn't be surprising. Office 365 growth has helped business revenue, and the Azure platform continues to be a worthy, if still much smaller, competitor to Amazon Web Services in cloud. It's the potential for success in those products that has offset fears about continuing pressure on revenue from Windows, as PC sales decline and mobile usage increases.Indeed, the gain in MSFT stock from $27 to $63 has come mostly from the transition.The fears of Windows losses that led MSFT stock to be valued around 10x EPS in 2013 have turned to optimism toward growth in Azure, Office 365, Enterprise Mobility and other areas. That optimism has pushed the same stock to be valued at about 21x FY17 earnings.So it seems unlikely that investors will focus on the major headline numbers coming out of the Microsoft earnings report. A beat or miss of a penny or two on earnings likely isn't going to drive the market's reaction to the report - particularly if that weakness comes from Windows. Rather, the focus is going to be on the growing, smaller, businesses, most notably Azure.There's a reason Microsoft has steadily expanded its disclosure around Azure and cloud growth: That's where investor attention has been. And it seems likely that's where investor attention will stay coming out of the Q2 Microsoft earnings report.What to Watch For in Microsoft EarningsInvestors seem likely to have some patience with a modest miss in the Microsoft earnings report, as expectations remain relatively low. The company still is getting out from under its deal withNokia Corp (ADR)(NYSE:NOK), and layoffs this year should provide a boost to margins over the next few quarters. Wall Street in particular isn't expecting growth to pick up until fiscal 2018, where sales are projected to grow more than 6% against a rate under 2% in fiscal 2017.So what seems to be important in the Q2 Microsoft earnings report is whether the base of that growth is intact.While Azure is estimated to generate just 3% of total revenue,accordingto analyst firm MKM Partners, its growth rate certainly will be watched closely. After a 140% increase in Q2 FY16, and 116% last quarter, any slowdown seems likely to hurt the stock. But another 100%-plus figure would give further evidence that Azure is a worthy competitor to AWS, and support the current MSFT stock price.The cloud business as a whole - including Office 365 and Dynamics, which is trying to take share fromSalesforce.com, Inc.(NYSE:CRM) - will be another area of post-earnings analysis.Here's Why Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock     Will Hit $75What does that mean for Microsoft stock coming out of the Microsoft earnings report?Overall, it means that the quarter seems likely to be judged more on ""feel"" than on the hard numbers. Even though cloud and mobile still aren't the majority of MSFT revenue or earnings, they are the cornerstones of the Microsoft strategy going forward. And for now, it's relatively clear that the market is content to wait for those sales and profits - as long as it continues to trust in that strategy.If Microsoft can deliver another earnings report that shows growth is on the horizon, MSFT stock likely will rise - even if the headline numbers aren't perfect. But if there's any sort of stumble in either cloud or mobile, that investor patience could reverse - quickly.As of this writing, Vince Martin did not hold a position in   any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 High-Yield Dividend Stocks That Are SOMEHOW     Still Bargains7 Straight-A Stocks to Build Your Portfolio     AroundMicrosoft Corporation (MSFT) Is Building an AI     MonsterThe postMicrosoft Corporation (MSFT) Q2 Earnings Previewappeared first onInvestorPlace."

3 ETF Myths And 4 Trading Tips From The Man Who Helped Launch SPY;1/25/2017;"Why is SPDR S&P 500 (SPY), beloved of so many investors in exchange traded funds, like an   Apple (AAPL) iPhone? In both cases, the teams who helped launch the products   did not anticipate they would revolutionize an industry.""When we designed SPY, we had no idea how flexible the ETF   vehicle would turn out to be,"" Jim Ross, chairman of the global   SPDR business at State Street Global Advisors, said Tuesday at   the 10th annual Inside ETFs conference in Hollywood, Fla. ""We   could not have imagined all the innovative ways ETFs are being   used today.""Ross, who was part of the team that launched SPY 24 years ago,   made that point as he drew a parallel between the iPhone's impact   on the technology industry and ETFs' transformation of the   investment landscape.makeArticleAd();As U.S. ETFs enter their 25th year, the ETF industry is   cheering both the fact that this investment vehicle holds a total   of more than $2 trillion in assets and that ETFs represent less   than 5% of the investable market - meaning, there's still plenty   of room to grow.ETFs certainly continue to be on a hot growth streak. ""ETF   assets have roughly doubled every three years over the past   decade,"" Ross said at a conference session titled ""The ETF   Revolution And What's Next For ETFs."" He said that there is no   reason why global ETF assets cannot cross $16 trillion by 2025 at   the continued annual growth rate of 19%.Driving demand for, and innovative use of, ETFs are a host of   insurance companies, ETF strategists, sovereign wealth funds,   wealth management firms and even mutual funds, he added.But Ross also pointed out that risks tied toETF   investinginclude a persistent lack of understanding about these   investment vehicles. In his afternoon address, he sought to   debunk common myths about ETFs and offered some tips for trading   ETFs.Myth 1:""ETF liquidity (issues) could blow up the fixed-income   market."" Despite this common perception, ETFs comprise less than   1% of the total fixed-income market, Ross said. That makes it   unlikely they will ""blow up"" an entire market.In fact, Ross believes fixed-income ETFs can be more efficient   than other fixed-income products, as assets in them have   continued to increase to more than $400 billion today. And   although the underlying fixed-income market can be opaque,   fixed-income ETFs offer transparency in terms of trading costs   and portfolio holdings, he added.Myth 2:""ETFs gone wild."" Referring to the belief that the   proliferation of ETFs can harm investors, Ross said he believes   ETF issuers like his own company are diligent about making sure   new launches meet existing needs. Even a crudely constructed ETF,   he added, displays the American value of ""take an idea to market   and test it out.""The lesson here, Ross said, is that ""all ETF investors need to   understand what they are buying, when they are buying.""Myth 3:""ETFs fail to track intrinsic value in volatile markets.""   According to Ross, ETFs have in some cases helped the process of   price discovery in challenging markets.""That happened on Aug. 24 (2015),"" he said. ""SPY traded   efficiently throughout the day"" despite the extreme volatility inthe stock marketthat day.Ross noted, too, that following that day's tradingdisruptions in some stocks and ETFs, an ETF industry coalition took action to harmonize exchange   rules to address the issue.The lesson here, Ross added, is to understand ETF trading   basics:1. If you don't have to trade in volatile markets, don't.2. Don't trade near the market open. Volatility tends to be   high as the markets price in the news.3. Use limit orders. These are generally seen to have   advantages over market orders in terms of price control and   protection.4. Reconsider the use of stop orders. As many ETF investors   unhappily discovered on Aug. 24, stop orders become market orders   once the price is hit. And they run the risk of selling for much   below their intended price in serious market disruptions.A stop order is an order to buy or sell a stock once the price   of the stock reaches a specified price. A limit order is an order   to buy or sell a stock at a specified price or better.Introducing Ross to the audience, Inside ETFs CEO Matt Hougan   made note of Ross' leadership role in the industry for more than   two decades.""There's a reason everyone loves him,"" Hougan said. ""He's the   chairman of the ICI (Investment Company Institute) ETF committee.   He does education everywhere he can.""The Inside ETFs conferenceconcludes Wednesday.RELATED:The 'Trump ETFs' Spotlighted As 6 Best     Investment Ideas For 2017"
