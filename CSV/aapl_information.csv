Apple Inc. Has Big Plans for Its Fast-Growing Services Business;February 04, 2017, 11:22:00 AM EDT;"Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is primarily a hardware company. Most of its   revenue comes from the sale of iPhone, iPad, and Mac products.   Beyond those key product categories, the company generates   meaningful revenue from its Apple Watch family of smartwatch   products, as well as from the various accessories, such as its   well-received AirPod line of wireless earbuds.Apple music running on different Apple products. Image     source: Apple.makeArticleAd();However, one of the most exciting parts of the company's   portfolio is the services business, which the company says   ""includes revenue from Digital Content and Services, AppleCare,   Apple Pay, licensing and other services.""This segment has been on a robust growth path for quite some   time, with revenue here growing 10% in the company's fiscal year   2015 and then a whopping 22% in fiscal year 2016. In the   company's most recent quarter, it reported that services revenue   was up another 18% year-over-year.This isn't a small business, either -- at least in absolute   terms. It generated more than $24 billion in the company's last   fiscal year, making up more than 10% of the company's   consolidated revenue. To really put it into proper perspective,   services was Apple's second-largest business by revenue in 2016   -- bigger than the iPad and Mac.On the company's most recent earnings call, CEO Tim Cook made   public the company's vision for services over the next four   years, and it's quite ambitious.Doubling revenue in just four years""Services are becoming a larger part of our business, and we   expect the revenues to be the size of a Fortune 100 company this   year"", Cook said.Cook then went on to say that Apple ""feel[s] great about this   momentum"" and that the company aims to ""double the size of [its]   Services business in the next four years"".Of course, what Apple's goals are and what happens aren't   necessarily the same thing, but the fact that management is   willing to put a growth figure out there -- a hard number that   investors will now hold Apple accountable for -- speaks to the   company's confidence.What would a doubling of this business mean?Put simply, doubling the business from the revenue levels seen   in 2016 would mean that, by 2020, Apple's services business will   be bringing in about $48 billion. If Apple can get the business   to that scale and then grow it at a modest rate from that point   forward (perhaps 5% to 10% annually), then that would do wonders   for Apple's longer-term revenue growth prospects.What's not entirely clear, however, is how that growth will   translate into incremental profitability. CFO Luca Maestri said   on the call that, on average, the gross profit margin of Services   businesses ishigherthan the corporate average, so an increase in Services mix should   help Apple on the gross profit margin front.That said, as Apple scales up its services revenue, it will   likely need to drive up operating expenses associated with the   business, as well. While I do expect nice growth in profitability   from a boost in services, the incremental gross profit isn't all   flowing to the bottom line.At the end of the day, if Apple hits its growth target with   respect to this growing segment, it should be less dependent on   the iPhone and could ultimately see earnings multiple expansion   as software/services companies tend to be valued more by   investors than pure hardware plays.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Will Donald Trump Target Share Buybacks Next?;February 04, 2017, 08:02:00 AM EDT;"Donald Trump. Image source: Whitehouse.gov.President Donald Trump has taken several bold steps since   taking office, but one area seems to be a bigger priority than   any other. Trump has been adamant about getting American   companies to invest in the U.S. by building factories and plants   and hiring American workers. In his inaugural address, he   declared that as a central theme of his presidency, imploring   American companies to ""buy American and hire American.""makeArticleAd();Before he even took the oath of office, Trump said he had   struck a deal withUnited Technologies'Carrier Industries to keep about 800 jobs in Indiana that were   slated to go to Mexico. He pressured other manufacturers like   automakers to keep jobs in the country, and may have influencedFord'sdecision to scrap plans for a new plant in Mexico.Once in office, Trump backed out of the Trans Pacific   Partnership, a 12-nation trade deal, and met with leaders of the   Big 3 automakers to urge them to expand in the U.S.While those moves may help curry the favor of Trump's base,   their effect on investment in the U.S. is uncertain. The   automakers already believe that the auto market is at its   cyclical peak, as last year marked a record for vehicle sales,   and they are therefore reluctant to invest in new factories.Manufacturing jobs have certainly declined over the past   generation, but analysts tend to blame that on automation rather   than outsourcing.Trump has supported tax breaks that would encourage companies   to bring back money kept overseas. Some see this as step one to   getting the companies to invest in American jobs. Others see it   as priming the companies to use the money to buy back their own   shares. Larry Fink, BlackRock founder and CEO and a member of   Trump's ""President's Strategic and Policy Forum,"" recently warned   that companies should only engage in buybacks ""when they are   confident that the return on those buybacks will ultimately   exceed the cost of capital and the long-term returns of investing   in future growth.""Fink mentioned Trump by name twice in his Jan. 24annual letter to CEOs, saying in part:If tax reform also includes some form of reduced taxation     for repatriation of cash trapped overseas, BlackRock will be     looking to companies' strategic frameworks for an explanation     of whether they will bring cash back to the U.S., and if so,     how they plan to use it. Will it be used simply for more share     buybacks? Or is it a part of a capital plan that appropriately     balances returning capital to shareholders with prudently     investing for future growth?President Trump has indicated an interest in infrastructure     investment, which has the dual benefits of improving overall     productivity and creating jobs, especially for workers     displaced by technology.Fink went on to write that infrastructure investing is not a   solution to automation taking jobs, saying ""businesses will need   to increase the earnings potential of the workers who drive   returns, helping the employee who once operated a machine learn   to program it.""Trump has showed himself committed to American jobs. We don't   know if he will use his bully pulpit to try to force companies to   forgo buybacks, but he might if he follows the logic that doing   so would result in the companies instead putting the money to use   in ways that would boost American workers. Let's take a look at   the issue.A Wall Street favoriteShare repurchases, orbuybacks, in which a company buys share of its own stock, were once   illegal, as they were seen as facilitating insider trading   because a company could act on information not available to the   public. The SEC changed the rule in 1982, and since then, stock   buybacks have become increasingly popular. According toHSBC, American companies have spent $2.1 trillion on repurchases over   the last five years.Often called a form of financial engineering by detractors,   share buybacks boost a company's earnings per share, not by   increasing earnings, but by reducing the number of shares   outstanding. The pie is split among fewer shares. Investors to   tend to cheer share buybacks due to the lift they give to stock   prices, but from a larger economic perspective, and possibly from   Donald Trump's point of view, they may be the least efficient   form of spending cash.Image source: Getty Images.By allocating money to buy back shares, business are choosing   to spend profits on inflating earnings per share instead of   potentially investing in the long-term growth of the business by   opening new plants, hiring or training new workers, investing in   research and development, or even acquiring other companies.   Unlike dividends, the other from of returning capital to   shareholders, buybacks don't give money to current shareholders   that can be reinvested, and they do not add market value to the   company, which is based in part on the number of shares   outstanding. In other words, no value is being created by   repurchases in the aggregate.  Share repurchases are   controversial for a number of reasons, but their ability to   dissuade companies from investing in long-term growth is   certainly one of the biggest.How the pros do itWith interest rates especially low in recent years, many   companies have taken on debt, not to expand their businesses, but   to reward shareholders with buybacks.Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) founder Steve Jobs refused to pay a dividend,   believing that it meant the company was out of ideas. He also   didn't authorize share repurchases.Apple under Tim Cook, however, has taken out $87 billion in   debt to fund repurchases, reducing the share count by 1.3 billion   in the process, and spending about $125 billion in the process.   Part of the reason Apple has done so is because much of its cash   is parked overseas and it wants to avoid repatriation taxes, but   one could see the Trump administration cutting a deal with the   iPhone maker to reduce or eliminate repatriation taxes if it   agreed to invest in jobs in the U.S.Apple, with nearly $200 billion overseas, has been demanding   such an arrangement for years, and could be willing to invest   some of that cash in the U.S. if the tax rate was significantly   reduced. Notably FoxConn, its biggest supplier, said it was   considering opening a plant in Pennsylvania that would employ   50,000 Americans. Apple is unlikely itself to invest in domestic   manufacturing, but since FoxConn assembles iPhones and other   Apple products, if it opened a plant in Pennsylvania, it would   mean that some Apple products would be made in America, though   outsourced to a Chinese company.Trump has said he would like to make deals with corporations   to bring some of their overseas cash back home, though that would   likely come with stipulations.Goldman Sachspredicted Trump's tax and repatriation plans would encourage more   buybacks as it frees up cash for companies, but BlackRock's Fink   scolded corporations in his recent letter for spending so much on   buybacks.He noted that the total thatS&P 500companies have spent on dividends and buybacks in the last   12 months is greater than the operating profits they've   earned. With $5 trillion in assets under management, the   Blackrock CEO's missives attract attention on Wall Street, and if   he gets the President's ear, Trump could end up using the bully   pulpit to excoriate big business for its excessive buybacks.IBM's(NYSE: IBM) recent misadventures perhaps best illustrate the   folly of buybacks. After outlining a goal in 2010 of reaching $20   in earnings per share (EPS) by 2015, Big Blue spent aggressively   on repurchases to pump up EPS to meet that target, pouring $70   billion between 2010-2014 into lowering its share count. As a   result, however, the business suffered.Revenue at the tech giant has now fallen for 19 quarters in a   row, and the company was forced to step back from its $20 EPS   goal in 2014. In 2016, adjusted EPS was just $13.59, down 9% from   the previous year. In the meantime, IBM has also slashed   headcount as the number of employees has fallen by close to   100,000, since its peak in 2014, to 368,000. Considering Big   Blue's decision to use profits to reward investors while laying   off employees, the company would seem to be a target ripe for   Trump's ire.It's not just tech companies that are using this tactic, as   manufacturers likeGM, Ford, andCaterpillarhave all been spending on share repurchases recently.Any attempt by the Trump administration to tackle share   repurchases would likely rankle Wall Street, which favors the   practice. But as the president looks for more levers to pull to   boost the ""forgotten men and women"" of America, share buybacks   may start to look like a worthy target.10 stocks we like better than Wal-MartWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock     tip, it can pay to listen.

Why This 1 Number Is So Important to Apple Investors;February 03, 2017, 07:08:00 PM EDT;"Image source: Apple.The iPhone is by far the most important product inApple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) lineup. The device accounted for over 69% of the   company's first-quarter sales. After three consecutive quarters   of unit sales declines, Apple righted the ship with the release   of the iPhone 7 last fall, driving a near-5% increase in unit   sales.makeArticleAd();But more important than the growth in units is Apple's ability   to sell its higher-end device, the iPhone 7 Plus. CEO Tim Cook   revealed the newest model was the best selling Plus model it's   released yet during the company's first-quarter earnings call.   The ability to sell higher-end devices is key for the company   going forward as it becomes increasingly difficult to grow unit   sales.A look at selling pricesData source: Apple quarterly reports.The first thing that stands out in the chart above is the huge   drop in average sales price (ASP) during the previous three   quarters. The drop coincides with the release of the lower-priced   iPhone SE, which starts at just $399. After a late second-quarter   release, sales of the model seemed to peak in the third quarter,   resulting in a low $595 ASP for all iPhone units.Apple also faced significant foreign exchange headwinds over   the past year. CFO Luca Maestri noted the dollar has strengthened   25% against the basket of currencies where Apple does business   since June 2014. That led Apple to raise some of its prices in   foreign countries last year.But more iPhone shoppers opted for the high-end iPhone 7 Plus   last quarter, leading to a record ASP of $695. That's even more   astonishing considering the inclusion of the iPhone SE in those   sales.What's so telling about the popularity of the iPhone 7   Plus?Unlike in the two previous Plus models of the iPhone, the 7   Plus included a higher-end camera compared to its   smaller-screened sister. That point of differentiation may be   what led more consumers to opt for the more expensive device last   quarter.The significant demand for the 7 Plus shows that Apple has the   potential to drive sales growth by further differentiating the   Plus lineup from the standard iPhone model. Instead of just   offering a larger screen, Apple can keep its best innovations   exclusively for its highest-paying customers before letting them   trickle down to the lower-priced models.Such a move would strengthen the position of the Plus model in   the simple good, better, best price positioning Apple uses. Just   as importantly, the upsell is easy thanks to installment plans --   just $4 more per month gets you the best ever phone, camera,   mobile gaming machine, Snapchat device, and so on.But don't get excited just yetThere's no doubt that Apple benefited from one of its biggest   competitors running into some technical difficulties late last   year.Samsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) had to recall its Galaxy Note 7 after units   started randomly exploding due to battery malfunctions.Many Note 7 customers likely ended up buying an iPhone 7 Plus   for its similarly sized screen. Cook noted it saw the highest   Android switcher rate of any quarter.Obviously, Apple can't rely on Samsung or one of its other   major competitors having problems with their large-screen phones   every quarter. That's why investors must pay attention to the   iPhone ASP going forward to see if last quarter was a fluke or if   Apple's differentiation strategy is paying off. If ASP continues   to rise, it could bode well if Apple further differentiates its   newest Plus model even more from the standard model in the   fall.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Why 2 Well-Known Tech Companies Are Making Significant AI Acquisitions;February 03, 2017, 05:22:00 PM EDT;"With the race for artificial intelligence (AI) shifting into   high gear, companies are not only developing AI systems in-house,   but are increasingly bringing start-ups into the fold to augment   their efforts. Market intelligence firm CB Insights released its   list ofAI acquisitionsover the last five years. A review of the most active acquirers   can provide insight into future developments at those companies,   and show how the new technologies are being integrated.Artificial intelligence acquisitions are skyrocketing. Image     source: Pixabay.makeArticleAd();One intriguing revelation is that many of the acquired   companies work in the areas of deep learning and machine   learning, two disciplines within AI. Algorithms and software are   used to develop models of the human brain called neural networks,   attempting to recreate our capacity to learn. Another revelation   is that much of the acquired technology can be directly   integrated intovirtual personal assistants. This is an area of great interest to big tech, but is alsobeing pursuedby a surprising number ofother companies.Apple is on an AI buying spree. Image source: Author.Apple is giving Siri a makeoverApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) has been at the leading edge of AI since its   introduction of Siri five years ago. While it is making a   significant number of acquisitions, each appears to specialize in   a different area:VocalIQ concentrated its deep-learning capabilities to     better understand human speech. This could provide Siri with an     upgrade.Perceptio can run neural-network algorithms and perform     advanced calculations locally on a cellphone, without uploading     user data to the cloud. This would help Apple protect consumer     data bykeeping it localto each phone.Emotient attempts to read facial expressions in order to     determine a person's emotional state. This recent acquisition     is likely related to apatent Apple applied forin 2014, describing a system for determining mood based on     numerous factors, including facial expressions.Tuplejump provided a better way to apply deep learning to     large data sets as they are uploaded. Apple has previously     stated that it could receive filtered data from iPhones, and     this technology would enable it to process the data in real     time.One especially compelling acquisition was Turi, described as a   ""machine learning platform for developers and data scientists.""   It had created tools that allowed developers to build apps   utilizing deep learning that could scale for many users; this   tool kit was described as being similar to Google's TensorFlow   open-source machine-learning library. Turi allows Apple to bring   AI capabilities to developers for its App Store offerings.Twitter wants a seat at the big tech tableTwitter acquired Whetlab to boost AI efforts. Image source:     Whetlab.Twitter(NYSE:TWTR) has made a number of AI-related acquisitions in the area of   machine learning. Each appears to provide the company with   specific opportunities to improve its current business:Madbits focused on technology related to searching and     understanding images, and the ability to organize large data     sets. It previously released an iOS app that created photo     collages.Magic Pony developed neural networks that can sharpen     blurry cellphone images or video to near HD-quality. It also     can use information in the original to improvise new or     expanded images -- great for use in virtual reality. These will     both help Twitter increase its image features.TellApart allows marketers to better target potential     customers across device platforms. This could improve     monetization of Twitter's ads.Whetlab is probably the most interesting acquisition. While it   is less business-specific, it will bring the most advanced AI   capability. It created technology that helps companies jump-start   their deep learning by providing an infrastructure; the time   required to train AI systems is reduced from months to days. This   technology can be used to improve a variety of areas in Twitter's   business, including language understanding, image recognition,   and user profiles.These acquisitions reveal how two very different technology   companies are integrating AI with a goal of improving their   respective businesses. Acquisitions for their own sake are folly,   but using them to gain a competitive advantage, improve business   processes, or to better serve customers can lead to success. Time   will tell how successful each of these companies has been in   leveraging these technologies.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

"Apple (AAPL) On Track to ""Make in India"" by April 2017?";February 03, 2017, 05:02:00 PM EDT;"Reportedly,AppleAAPLwill set up its iPhone assembly line in India by the end of Apr 2017. The iPhone-maker will set up its first manufacturing unit in Bangalore, Karnataka and has teamed up with Wistron Corp. from Taiwan to take care of the assembly of the iPhones.Why India?The decision comes at a time when the smartphone market is witnessing a slowdown in other parts of the world except India, which remains the fastest growing market in the segment.With Narendra Modi at the helm, the tagline of ""Make in India"" is fast catching up with global manufacturing majors. The Apple deal could open the doors for other global players to set up their manufacturing units in the country.However, China still remains a major contender in the manufacturing space.Apple Inc. Price and ConsensusApple Inc. Price and Consensus|Apple Inc. QuoteWhat Does This Mean for Apple?Currently, the smartphone scene in India is being dominated by Samsung Electronics Co. and other comparatively cheap Chinese brands such as Oppo.As per a Counterpoint Research report, in 2016, Apple shipped 2.5 million iPhones to India. However, the company ranked 10thin the top smartphone vendors list for the December quarter. An estimated 750 million smartphones are projected to be sold in the country by 2020, where Apple currently has only a 2% market share.As per capita income in the country is on the rise, this trend is likely to witness a major shift with people turning to premium-priced phones such as the iPhone in the future.Moreover, Apple's strategy to remain a fabless firm by handing over capital intensive processes such as manufacturing, factory building and staff hiring to third parties (in this case Wistron Corp.) are expected to positively impact the company's bottom-line going ahead.Stock Performance OverviewShares of Apple have performed more or less in line with the broader ZacksComputer - Mini Computersindustry over the last one year.

"Dow 30 Stock Roundup: Apple, Intel, Exxon Beat; Merck, Pfizer, Chevron Miss on Revenues";February 03, 2017, 04:59:00 PM EDT;"The Dow suffered losses over the week as optimism over Trump's election gave way to apprehension over his actions as President. Newly introduced immigration rules led to protests, criticism and legal challenges. Additionally, the tech sector expressed concerns over the impact these regulations would have on their businesses. Trump's approach on trade and foreign policy also led to widespread heartburn and dampened investor sentiment.Last Week's PerformanceThe Dow lost a meager 0.04% last Friday after fourth quarter GDP fell short of estimates.  U.S economy slowed more than expected in the fourth quarter after plunge in shipments of soyabeans adversely affected exports. Annual growth failed to reach 3% for the 11th straight year, indicating the hurdles Trump administration faces to speed up expansion. Orders for long-lasting goods, meantime, dropped 0.4% in December for the second month in a row.The index gained 1.3% over last week. Trump's growth-focused actions led the benchmarks to close in positive territory. His moves to revive two major oil pipeline projects, signing executive orders to improve border security and control immigration raised speculation that he will proceed with tax cuts, financial deregulation and introduce expansionary infrastructure spending.The DowThisWeekThe index declined 0.6% on Monday as investors' grappled over President Trump's order to tighten immigration rules. An executive order by Trump banned immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries, including legal residents and visa holders. Such an executive order spawned legal challenges, congressional criticism and widespread protests. Trump had earlier fostered expectations that his administration will be business friendly and therefore good for stocks.The Dow logged its worst daily loss since mid-October on Monday, while a popular measure of Wall Street fear climbed to its highest level in about three months.Consumer spending increased 0.5% in December, matching the consensus estimate, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis.The index declined 0.5% on Tuesday amid signs that momentum following President Donald Trump's election victory in November was fading. His signing of an executive order to temporary restrict immigration saw weekend chaos and backlash, eventually affecting stocks. Industrial, technology and financials shares tanked outweighing gains among traditional safe sectors including health-care and utilities. Meantime, a gauge of consumer confidence retreated in January from its highest level in 15 years.Despite such setbacks, major indexes ended the month higher in what were their first January gains since 2013. The Dow added 0.5% for the month of January. Projections for stronger economic growth and upbeat corporate earnings boosted US stocks for the first January rise in five years. Stocks rallied on hopes that the new administration's policies including lowering of taxes and cutting regulations will bolster economic growth.The materials sector has fueled the rally, advancing 5.1% so far this year, following a 14% gain in 2016. Technology shares that trailed behind the broader market last year have also recorded sharp gains this year. The sector has risen 3.6% in January, its best month since last July. Earnings in the final quarter of 2016 came on the heels of growth in the third quarter that snapped a 15-month decline in earnings.The index gained 0.1% on Wednesday after Apple Inc.AAPL, the largest U.S. company by market cap, reported upbeat earnings. Meanwhile, the Fed ended its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday and revealed that measures of consumer and business sentiment have improved of late. But the Fed kept rates unchanged within a range of 0.5% to 0.75%.More importantly for investors, the central bank didn't give any sign that it would raise rates in its next meeting in March, putting the probability of such a move at only 18%, according to CME Group. The ISM manufacturing index climbed to 56% last month from 54.5% in December, marking the fifth straight gain and also its highest level since end 2014.The index declined a meagre 0.03% on Thursday after President Donald Trump's approach on trade and foreign policy dented investor sentiment. Investors grappled over Trump's executive order to tighten immigration rules, while the White House warned Iran that the country could face new sanctions over a recent ballistic missile test. Trump also labelled a refugee swap agreement with staunch ally Australia as a ""dumb deal"" and reiterated concerns about trade ties with Mexico.ComponentsMovingthe IndexApple's first quarter of fiscal 2017 earnings of $3.36 per share and revenues of $78.4 billion easily topped the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.22 and $76.9 billion. On a year-over-year basis, both metrics registered growth of 2.4% and 3.3%.Total iPhone unit sales came in at about 78.3 million, up 5% year over year.

3 Interesting Things We Learned From Snapchat's IPO Prospectus;February 03, 2017, 02:38:00 PM EDT;"Snap Inc., the parent company of photo-sharing application Snapchat, recently filed a prospectus with the SEC and is officially gearing up for an initial public offering. Snapchat has taken the social media landscape by storm since its debut in 2012, and with private valuations hitting nearly $25 billion, investors should be anticipating what could be the biggest tech IPO of the year.Snapchat co-founder and CEO Evan Spiegel, alongside fellow founder and CTO Bobby Murphy, will lead his company through this important period. At just 26 and 28 years of age, Spiegel and Murphy are set to become some of the wealthiest under-30s in the world after Snap Inc. debuts; just how much their net worths will swell depends on how big the company's IPO can get, and we got a better sense of this size from its recent prospectus filing.(Also Read:Inside Snapchat: The Best Tech IPO of 2017?)The prospectus contained tons of juicy information, including key financial and membership data. For example, we learned that Snapchat now has about 158 million average daily active users and its annual revenue swelled to $404.4 million in 2016. We also know that Snapchat plans to list its shares in March under the ticker ""SNAP."" The company filed for $3 billion debut, but this is expected to be a placeholder until Snap Inc. prices the deal.All of this information is important to know and understand as investors think about investing in Snapchat at its IPO. However, the juiciest details in the prospectus were ones that not every investor expected to see or knew to look for. Check out these three key facts that you may have missed:1.It's a ""camera company""  kind ofWhile most people would consider Snapchat a social media company, its prospectus proudly proclaimed that ""Snap Inc. is a camera company."" In the sense that Snapchat is inherently interested in its users' phone cameras, this is a logical statement; however, Snapchat is certainly not-nor does it seem interested in becoming-a major manufacturer of camera-based hardware.Sure, the company recently debuted its own line of camera-equipped sunglasses called ""Spectacles,"" but as its prospectus points out, 96% of revenue comes from advertising and that is unlikely to change soon. Do you know any other ""camera companies"" that rely on advertising revenue? Not really, which means Snapchat's labeling of itself as a ""camera company"" is more about its focus on the importance of the camera as a communicative device, not its business model.2.Mysterious third founder is goneThose who have followed Snapchat since its earliest days are probably already familiar with the impressive leadership of Spiegel and Murphy. However, every Snapchat-related story seems to include a mention of Reggie Brown, Snapchat's mysterious third founder who reportedly came up with the idea of disappearing photos.While we knew that Brown was no longer at the company, the prospectus finally revealed the full details on the situation, and it is a classic case of ""hush money"" that resembles the Winklevoss-Zuckerberg fiasco. According to the filing, Brown sued the company over intellectual property violations in February 2013. The parties involved eventually settled in September 2014, with Snap Inc. agreeing to pay Brown about $158 million in cash.3.They know their competitionOne of the key elements of a prospectus for a company like Snap Inc. is the information the company shares about its perceived challenges within its own industry. In that regard, it is clear that Snapchat is acutely aware of its competitors right now.The company underscores the dangers of competitors that ""mimic"" Snapchat's features throughout the report, and it uses a rhetoric of caution to describe the businesses that challenge it.""Many of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater resources and broader global recognition and occupy better competitive positions in certain markets than we do,"" the prospectus said, identifying FacebookFB, AppleAAPL, Alphabet Inc.GOOGL, LINELN, Twitter (TWTR), and many others as key foes.Final DetailsStartups like Snapchat benefit greatly from keeping their books closed and operating under the cover of being private, but the era is nearly over for Snap Inc., and the company will soon have many new shareholders to please.Looking ahead, we can expect a SNAP offering in March, and pricing details should come closer to that time. Other than that, we know that SNAP will be listed on the NYSE and some of the world's biggest banks, including Morgan StanleyMS, Goldman SachsGS, JPMorganJPM, Deutsche BankDB, BarclaysBCS, and Credit SuisseCS, are working on the deal.Which Stocks are Zacks Experts Talking   About?Stocks in today's headlines may be tempting buys, but how would you like a sneak peek at the stocks Zacks experts recommend?

3 Tech Stocks That Will Win as Qualcomm Collapses;February 03, 2017, 01:48:28 PM EDT;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIt's often stated by motivational speakers that the Chinese word for ""crisis"" is composed of two characters - one signifying danger, the other opportunity. It's alsoembarrassingly inaccurate. This goes to show you that if the crux of an investment argument invokes ""the Chinese,"" stop! You might be getting had. Still, this ""Chinese philosophy"" is extremely relevant for tech stocks these days.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockThat's because semiconductor and digital communications giantQualcomm, Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM) is having a year to forget. Despite the fact that it's only early February, QCOM shares are down 18.5% year-to-date. Not surprisingly, Qualcomm is trading firmly below its 50- and 200-day moving averages. If something substantive doesn't happen soon, it risks repeating the disaster of 2015, when QCOM lost nearly 31%.The disaster that Qualcomm is currently facing was seen well in advance by those watching the industry closely. The crux of the issue is the company's technology licensing business. This is themost lucrativedivision for QCOM, accounting for the majority of its profits. By ""selling the rights to use patents that are essential to all modern mobile phone systems,"" QCOM had a monopoly. That's an incredible opportunity, so long as you don't get caught.Of course, they got caught. First, it was, you guessed it - the Chinese. Regulators in the world's second-biggest economy found Qualcomm guilty of violating theiranti-monopoly law. Then, individual companies began filing complaints. Finally, the Federal Trade Commission got involved in mid-January, claiming that QCOM illegally maintained a monopoly. Shares never looked the same after that, and who knows when Qualcomm will recover.Those are questions that analysts will squabble over. But for rival tech stocks, they only have one message - better you than me. It's not just the fact that a major competitor is falling. This is a classic case where an enemy of an enemy is a friend. Furthermore, the benchmarkTechnology SPDR (ETF)(NYSEARCA:XLK) is up 4.6% YTD. Granted, these aren't the best numbers, but it's much more preferable than what Qualcomm is going through.The Top 10 Dow Dividend Stocks for FebruaryWhile QCOM is swimming with the sharks, here are three tech stocks that are now set up to win big!Tech Stocks That Will Win as QCOM Falls: Apple Inc. (AAPL)Click to EnlargeUndoubtedly, of all the tech stocks that were affected by Qualcomm,Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands to be the biggest winner.On Jan. 20, AAPL filed suit against Qualcomm, alleging that the company ""withheld $1 billion in rebates in retaliation for Apple cooperating with Korean efforts to open the radio chip market."" Although it's difficult to call a stalwart like AAPL a ""victim,"" the pattern of allegations is pretty damning.First, we already saw Qualcomm violate foreign anti-competition laws, and pay dearly for it. Second, Korean manufacturerSamsung Electronics Co. Ltd(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) alleged similar shenanigans, although they later backed down. Finally, and most importantly, the FTC claimed that Qualcomm forced AAPL to use their chips to prevent competitor encroachment. For Qualcomm, Applr is its biggest customer, so the potential ramifications are deep and wide.Of course, Cupertino isn't going to shed any tears.Last October, AAPL ""reported its first decline in annual sales and profit in 15 years,"" according toThe Guardian. There are serious concerns that the king of consumer tech stocks has reached peak popularity. Whatever it is, Apple needs to boost its profitability. Getting out of unfavorable contracts is a good start.And with the world seemingly against Qualcomm, AAPL has an excellent chance of reviving itself at their expense.Tech Stocks That Will Win as QCOM Falls: Intel Corporation (INTC)Click to EnlargeAlthough I believe that Apple will get the most benefit out of the QCOM fiasco,Intel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) has a strong case as well. I wouldn't be surprised if most people viewed it as a toss-up between the two titans.Among tech stocks, INTC is one of the most recognizable, but for the wrong reasons. Everybody knows the ""Intel Inside"" slogan, but the only problem is that it relates to the aging personal computer business.It's a common challenge for consumer tech stocks - INTC needs to find new blood. The company'srevenue growthisn't the most consistent in the world. That's why the partnership last year between Intel and AAPL was a much-needed step in the right direction. Up until that point, Qualcomm was the sole provider of chips for the iPhone.In 2016, INTC stepped in to provide half the demand. Apparently, QCOM took exception to this arrangement; hence, the FTC charges of competitive foul play.So far, the market response towards Intel stock has been mixed. Therefore, I still give the advantage to Apple. Nevertheless, encouraging signs do exist. Yes, shares are down 4% from its high of the year. However, it's still very close to parity for the year. Furthermore, INTC remains inside a bullish trend channel that began in late summer of 2015.7 Stocks to Sell as Fear Returns to the MarketThe collapse at Qualcomm just gives other tech stocks more options, and Intel is happy to help.Tech Stocks That Will Win as QCOM Falls: Broadcom Ltd (AVGO)Click to EnlargeWhile virtually all tech stocks are affected by the Qualcomm crisis, few were as glued to their TV screens asBroadcom Ltd(NASDAQ:AVGO).As a semiconductor and communications company themselves, AVGO is a direct competitor and rival to QCOM.Naturally, if your primary nemesis goes down hard, it raises the boat for everyone else. And Qualcomm is sinking quite nicely for the Singapore-based firm.It's not just the fact that QCOM has transitioned into the world's most hated stock. Nor is it the money that they'll have to dish out in penalties. Rather, Qualcomm will be forced to fundamentally change its business plan. If it doesn't, government watchdogs are on standby, eager to pounce. That just gives AVGO and others a leg up. Maybe Broadcom is no saint. However, at the moment, the spotlight isn't on it, providing a margin of comfort.Most importantly, AVGO is making the most of its ""Chinese crisis."" On a YTD basis, shares are up a smoking 16% - that's almost the exact inverse of Qualcomm's results. Furthermore, Broadcom is trending inside a steadily rising channel. With so much ugliness associated with its primary rival, it's hard not to see anything but optimism for AVGO.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.The post3 Tech Stocks That Will Win as Qualcomm Collapsesappeared first onInvestorPlace."

If You Like Apple Inc., Youll Love Skyworks Solutions Inc (AAPL, SWKS);February 03, 2017, 12:01:52 PM EDT;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSuccessful stock market investing over the long term takes skills in several disciplines. First, you need to be able to think outside of the box by looking behind the headline stocks into lesser-known names operating behind the scenes.makeArticleAd();Now, I am certainly not saying to avoid the headline names. Getting in early on a favorite stock is a sure way to stock market profits. But often, once a stock starts making mainstream news headlines it's upward price momentum is about to slow or fail altogether.Identifying companies that support one or a combination of headline names yet do not get the same attention as the headliner is a consistent way to locate winning stocks for the long term.Once you locate your behind-the-news stock, it's time to take a close look at its fundamentals to make certain there is support behind the price move. Are the fundamentals improving over time? Are revenue and sales upward-trending from quarter to quarter? Do the products and services support an overall societal or economic trend? These are the basic questions to answer before making an investing decision.Next, make certain the share price is in an overall upward trend. This means judging whether the shares higher over the last year and by how much they are up relative to the headline name.Ideally, the stock should be outpacing the headliner price-performance wise and consistently making new highs on the daily price chart.I like stocks that are trading at or near their highs for one of my favorite investing tactics, trend following.I define trend following as buying stocks as they make new highs, then riding the upward trend and protecting profits via trailing stops. Certainly, there are many permutations of this basic method, such as waiting for a short term pullback to enter long, but for the purpose of this article, buying breakouts to new highs will suffice.The ideal trend-following stock isSkyworks Solutions Inc(SWKS). This stock holds the key to the future of the Internet of Things. It has soared over 42% in the last 52 weeks, and the company just keeps outperforming. With both strong fundamentals and robust technicals, if there ever was a stock made to order for the trend-following investing method, this is the one.The Top 10 Dow Dividend Stocks for FebruaryI found this company by first noticing that thatApple Inc.(AAPL) shares had posted over 35% gains in the last 52 weeks, despite the apparent slowdown in iPhone sales. This observation led me to look behind the headlines to see what companies Apple depends on as suppliers.Skyworks jumped out immediately, as it obtains approximately 40% of its revenue from Apple, and is also a supplier to Apple's Chinese smartphone competitors such as Huawei.The fact that shares of Skyworks had skyrocketed around 42% over the last year truly piqued my interest, and here's whySkyworks specializes in connecting devices and technology, and experts are predicting there will be 70 billion internet connected devices by 2020. Called the Internet of Things, this burgeoning new web structure is expected to grow exponentially into the near future.Skyworks Solutions, Inc. officially describes itself as an analog semiconductor company powering the wireless networking revolution. Its innovative products are connecting people, places and things. These objects span some new and previously unimagined applications within the automotive, broadband, cellular infrastructure, connected home, industrial, medical, military, smartphone, tablet and wearable markets.The company posted strong results for its first fiscal quarter, with revenue for the first fiscal quarter at $914.3 million, up 9.4 percent sequentially and exceeding consensus estimates of $902.7 million.Operating income for the first fiscal quarter of 2017 was $321.9 million with diluted earnings per share of $1.38. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was also a record $495.9 million.""Skyworks delivered exceptional financial results in the first fiscal quarter of 2017 fueled by global demand for ubiquitous mobile connectivity and the Internet of Things,"" said Liam K. Griffin, president and chief executive officer of Skyworks. ""We are enabling the next phase of the wireless revolution, powering new and previously unimagined applications Skyworks is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this connectivity megatrend.""The company also positively guided that it will beat consensus revenue and non-GAAP EPS estimates in its fiscal second quarter.Even better, the company just launched a $500 million stock buyback program that should further accelerate the upward price trend.Risks To Consider:Whenever one is investing in high tech, there is always a competitive risk. New companies with innovative products cause disruption in the high-tech sector on a consistent basis. The disruption can dethrone leading firms and cause havoc to share prices.Apple Inc.

A forecast of $250 million to $900 million falls well below the Street's consensus of $1.33 billion. But it's not as bad as it looks, as most of the ""warning"" is tied to aggressive investments in media, fulfillment and India.As well, while investors are failing to rejoice Friday, Amazon also delivered the goods with its operating cash flow, which jumped by 38% to $16.4 billion.7 Stocks to Sell as Fear Returns to the MarketWhat's more, revenues of $3.54 billion from its coveted Amazon Web Services (AWS) unit climbed an impressive 47% over last year's same-quarter result of $2.41 billion, while contributing 9% to Amazon's net revenues for the year.By the ""Other"" Numbers That said, Amazon's report hasn't been nearly as punishing from the standpoint of professional options traders.Based on last night's 03 Feb $840 straddle market, pricing of $42 for the non-directional spread with AMZN stock at $840 amounted to traders putting the over/under bet at 5% or estimated range from $798 to $882. This weekly contract, which expires today, is the purest play on the earnings event and collectively tells us what traders expect for Amazon shares in the immediate aftermath of the announcement.Further, as most often it's the professional options traders and market makers that sell options premiums, the basic assumption is this more informed and disciplined group is collectively wagering on the ""under"" side of the 5% in AMZN stock.So far, not only has Friday's low of $801 in Amazon shares fallen within the forecast by options traders, but relative to past earnings events of the last few years, call and put premiums were decidedly below average.Thehistorical recordshows that over the past five years, the average up or down move in Amazon stock has been 8.4%, with a median reaction of 8.1%. Fine-tuning the price activity down to the last five quarters, AMZN's average move has been slightly higher at 9%, but a modestly lower median of 7.7%.AMZN Stock Daily ChartClick to EnlargeFinally, Friday's conditions in Amazon shares may not have been as fierce as we've been led to believe.Take a look at the accompanying chart. Ifcharts don't lie, then AMZN stockclearlywas a double-top pattern.I'm being facetious, of course. But even if I wasn't, I'd always look to hedge my directional bet with options and money management opportunities in case I read a chart like Amazon's with less-than-perfect forecasting.Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in any of the securities or their derivatives mentioned in this article.

Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock: 2 Reasons to Steer Clear;February 03, 2017, 10:51:38 AM EDT;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAdvanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ:AMD) is coming off a fourth-quarter earnings beat in which the company reported $1.1 billion in revenue. AMD stock bounced 16% to above the $12 level as a result, continuing a red-hot streak of nearly 500% returns in just 52 weeks.makeArticleAd();Source:Matthew Rutledge via FlickrThis was a sub-$2 stockjust a year agoamid fears about competition and potential bankruptcy.AMD is a leading maker of graphics cards, including Radeon for consumers and FirePro for workstations. The company operates in two segments: Computing and Graphics, which makes desktop and notebook processors and professional graphics; andEnterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom, producing server chips, embedded processors for the Internet of Things and chips for gaming consoles.Since taking the helm two years ago, Advanced Micro Devices CEOLisa Su-  an MIT-educated electrical engineer who has authored over 40 technical papers - has presided over a remarkable recovery. Now, AMD, having played second fiddle toIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) for decades, ismaking a playfor the PC and server markets, Intel's bread and butter. AMD's Ryzen CPU will challenge Intel's Core i5 and i7 chips.AMD is moving up the value chain amid a falling PC market, going from low-end to high-end PC processors .Even if prospects for Advanced Micro Devices' business are good, though, investors have to deal with a few issues. AMD hasn't posted an operating profit since the third quarter of 2014, holds a great deal of debt and yet trades at a stratospheric valuation.Amid these high expectations and gains worthy of bubble talk, is AMD stock still a buy? Here are two problems that should have the bulls taking a second look.AMD Has a Not-Great Balance SheetDespite many chipmakers such as AMD going ""fabless"" and outsourcing the fabrication of their chips to contract manufacturers such asTaiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd. (ADR)(NYSE:TSM), the industry remains capital-intensive.7 Stocks to Sell as Fear Returns to the MarketAdvanced Micro Devices escaped bankruptcy last year. It took advantage of low interest rates and improved investor confidence to restructure its debt in September 2016. AMD issued$600 million in sharesand $450 million in convertible senior notes. This enabled AMD to pay off $676 million in debt due in 2020. So instead of $600 million in AMD debt maturing in 2019, only $196 million will mature that year.Still, AMD is highly leveraged by several measures. With $1.435 billion in long-term debt and $416 million in shareholder equity as of Dec. 31, 2016, AMD's long-term debt-to-equity ratio stands at 3.44. That figure is much lower for Intel, at 0.38, andNvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA), at 0.37, indicating less leverage. Likewise, AMD's debt-to-capital ratio of 0.775 stands above 0.27 for both INTC and NVDA.Intel and Nvidia also are better able to service debt. For the year ended December 31, 2016, AMD generated only $90 million in operating cash flow, with $2.9 billion in total liabilities, a ratio of 0.031.NVDA earned $1.462 billion in operating cash flow for the four quarters ended October 30, 2016, with $4.24 billion in total liabilities, a ratio of 0.34.Intel showed an even healthier balance sheet, with $19.09 billion in operating cash flow for $48 billion in total liabilities, a ratio of 0.396.AMD Stock Is Much More ExpensiveNvidia and Intel are profitable and have a better track record of generating operating cash flow. They earned positive operating cash flow in the four most recent quarters, while AMD's operating cash flow went negative for two quarters.Still, AMD stock trades at a huge premium to both.AMD trades at a whopping 25.66 times book, versus 11.5 for Nvidia (which itself is high), and 2.61 for Intel. It's not difficult to justify a higher price than Intel given AMD's growth prospects, but for comparison's sake, know that while Wall Street sees Advanced Micro Devices growing revenues roughly 10% this year and next, NVDA should be sitting at roughly 37% annual sales growth after it reports Q4 earnings, with analysts expecting that to slow to ""only"" 16% next year.ConclusionIt's difficult to fight the momentum, but you might just want to in AMD stock. At this point, anyone tussling with Advanced Micro Devices is playing with overpriced fire.Should You Buy FireEye Inc (FEYE) Stock? 3 Pros, 3 ConsFrom a valuation standpoint, INTC actually looks like the best buy, simply because the market expects less from it than from AMD and NVDA. Also, Intel leads in the production of microprocessors, and this matters in the semiconductor industry, since often only the market leaders can turn a profit, while laggards destroy value.AMD made some mistakes in the past, switching back and forth between ARM and x86 architectures, and never was quite able to catch up to Intel. The stock looks promising, but dislodging Intel and showing a steady track record of profits will not be easy in this industry.As of this writing, Lucas Hahn did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace7 Awful Stocks You Need To Ditch Right AwayExxon Mobil Corporation (XOM) Stock Is Going to BounceApple Inc.

More iPhones, Less Profit;February 02, 2017, 05:26:00 PM EDT;"After three quarters of declining revenue and iPhone sales,Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) managed to return to growth during its first   fiscal quarter. Not only that, Apple put up some record numbers.   Revenue was $78.35 billion, up 3.3 % year over year and a new   quarterly record. EPS grew 2.4% to $3.36, also a new quarterly   record.iPhone unit sales surged 5% to 78.3 million, the most ever in   a single quarter. The company also set all-time revenue records   for services, Mac, and Apple Watch. There was a lot to like.Apple stocksurged the following day, with investors relieved that fears of a   continued slide in sales were overblown.While Apple put together a fine quarter, the company's results   aren't quite as good as they seem.makeArticleAd();Image source: Apple.A profit declineApple managed to grow its per-share earnings during the first   quarter, but a quick look at the income statement reveals a   different story. Apple increased its revenue by $2.48 billion   compared to the first quarter of last year, but cost of sales,   the cost of producing its products, surged $2.73 billion. Gross   profit declined by a little less than 1% as a result.So Apple sold more devices, but it accepted a lower gross   margin, and none of that extra revenue flowed through to the   bottom line. This gross profit decline and a 9% increase in   operating expenses led operating income to drop 3.4%. Net income   slumped by a smaller 1.6% thanks to an increase in other income,   which includes income for interest and dividends, among other   items.Apple was able to grow its EPS because of its expansive share   buyback program. The company's diluted share count declined by   4.8% year over year, fueled by billions of dollars of share   buybacks. Apple spent $10.9 billion on share buybacks during the   first quarter alone, an 57% increase compared to the prior-year   period.To be fair, Apple still generated $17.9 billion of net income   during the quarter, a staggering sum. But the fact that profit   and revenue are moving in opposite directions should be a concern   for investors. There's nothing wrong with share buybacks,   especially when cash continues to pile up. But they're the only   reason Apple was able to set an EPS record.An extra weekDid you know that Apple's first quarter this year had 14   weeks, compared to 13 weeks in the first quarter last year? If   you only read Apple's press release, this fact may come as a   surprise. Amongst all the talk of records, there's no mention of   the extra week. You would have had to delve into the 10-Q or   listen to the conference call in order to find recognition of   this substantial tailwind.If you just take the numbers and adjust them for this extra   week, the quarter doesn't look so good. Revenue would have   slumped 4.1%, iPhone unit sales would have declined 2.8%, and   operating income would have tumbled 10.3%. This is a simplistic   way to adjust for the extra week, as sales weren't spread out   uniformly throughout the quarter. But it gives a sense of how   significant an extra week can be.During the conference call, CFO Luca Maestri pointed to four   factors that offset this extra week. Slower growth of China   inventory, an earlier launch of the iPhone 7 compared to the   iPhone 6s in the previous year, a stronger U.S. dollar, and a   patent infringement payment in the first quarter of last year all   hurt the company's results relative to the prior-year period.Maestri doesn't say by what degree these factors offset the   extra week, and in the absence of an extra week, they would have   read like a list of excuses. Adjusted for that extra week,   Apple's first quarter wasn't as solid as the headline numbers   suggest. It almost certainly wasn't as bad as my simplistic   calculation above, but it puts an asterisk next to Apple's   numbers.The good news for Apple investors is that the company's   guidance for the second quarter was positive. Apple expects to   produce between $51.5 billion and $53.5 billion of revenue, up   from $50.6 billion during the second quarter of last year. Gross   margin is expected to decline, which will again pressure Apple's   bottom line.

Buy Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock on This Q4 Earnings Dip;February 02, 2017, 04:40:35 PM EDT;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsA few years ago, analysts had to add numbers from dozens of retail companies to see how Christmas went. Now they just wait on the earnings fromAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN), which came out after the market closed on Feb. 2. Unfortunately, Christmas wasn't as rosy as hoped, and AMZN stock is down about 4% in Thursday's after-market trade as a result.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockAmazon's final numbers were somewhat mixed. AMZN beat estimates on the earnings front, bringing in $1.54 per share - better than the consensus mark of $1.40, and the company's seventh straight quarter of profit.But Amazon was light on revenues, at $43.74 billion versus expectations of $44.84 billion. That still was a big jump from the $35.75 billion in revs last year, but not enough to please investors or experts. That caused AMZN stock to drop 4% within minutes.Bad news for most, though some - includingBlue Chip Growtheditor Louis Navellier - were hoping to buy Amazon stock on the dip.CEO Jeff Bezos emphasized the variety of Amazon Prime servicesin his release, mentioning new offerings in gaming, storage, music and its Prime Now same-day shopping services. The company's studio launched hit shows likeThe Grand TourandMan in the High Castle, while the movieManchester by the Seadrew Oscar nominations but will debut on Prime within a few months.5 Stocks to Buy to Defy a Weak FebruaryOur James Brumley was expecting fireworks after earnings, but most options traders were not making big bets either way. Most recently,I took some money off the table on Amazon, which as I noted was becoming a huge piece of my retirement savings.The biggest news from the analyst community was a super-bull call from Bill Miller, chairman of LMM Investments, claiming the value of AMZN stockcould double again in three years- making it more valuable thanApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL). He also stating that Amazon now has higher gross margins thanWal-Mart Stores Inc.(NYSE:WMT), which regularly sells nearly $120 billion of merchandise each quarter - not just at Christmas.The big turn in Amazon stock started when the company started breaking out numbers from Amazon Web Services, its cloud services unit,after the first quarter of 2015. Since then, the company has more than doubled, as the unit has been growing at 50% per year and proving it can book one-fourth of that revenue as operating profit, even when accounting for stock options given its top employees.In the third quarter, for instance, AWS earned $861 million on revenues of $3.231 billion. Yes, that's more thanthe whole company earned. Amazon still loses money regularly on its international expansion, where it now brings in nearly one-third of its revenue. For the fourth quarter, AWS brought in revenue of $3.54 billion, which was seen as disappointing.Why Buy AMZN Stock Now?It's the expectation of huge growth on a massive scale that have made Amazon the fourth-largest company by market capitalization in the U.S. It recently passedBerkshire Hathaway Inc.(NYSE:BRK.B), whose revenues regularly run 50% better than Amazon's Christmas expectations.Shares dropped 5.1% the day after the third quarter missed expectations oOct. 27, and you could have gotten Amazon for $719 per share two weeks later, on Nov. 14. But since then the stock has been on fire, and closed before earnings near $840 per share.Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA) Stock Has a Secret WeaponBuyers keep coming for Amazon because every quarter, it seems to do something spectacular.This quarter, for instance, it delivered a new credit card offering 5% all Amazon purchases to Prime members. It announced a new air hub near Cincinnati,sinking sharesofUnited Parcel Service, Inc.(NYSE:UPS) andFedEx Corporation(NYSE:FDX). Its Alexa personal assistant dominated the Consumer Electronics Show,as our Brad Moon reported.All this has made AMZN stock a must-have for a growing number of small investors, who race in whenever the stock stumbles.Just like it did this afternoon.Dana Blankenhornis a financial and technology journalist.

What's Next for iPhones After Strong Holiday Quarter?;February 02, 2017, 03:06:00 PM EDT;"AppleAAPLshares jumped over 6% yesterday after the company returned to growth in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. A lot of the optimism was on account of iPhone sales, which grew 4.7% from last year to the highest ever tally of 78.3 million units or around two-thirds of total sales. Street estimates varied between 77-78 million units.Apple Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseApple Inc. Price and EPS Surprise|Apple Inc. Quote""iPhone's Best Performance for Over a Year""Neil Mawston, Executive Director at Strategy Analytics, said in a statement that this was the iPhone's best performance in over a year, putting it back on top as the world's largest smartphone vendor. But he also said that the numbers were helped by the Samsung Note 7 fiasco. As a result, Samsung didn't see as much of the fourth-quarter bump-up as it usually does (it still managed a 29% share in the U.S. compared to Apple's 31%, according to Kantar Worldpanel).Apple's growth rate was also slightly lower than in the year-ago quarter, and was likely impacted by the stronger dollar and by stiff competition from local players in China like Huawei, ZTE, Lenovo, OPPO and Vivo that may have led to a loss in market share. Revenues from China were down 12% in the last quarter. Tim Cook used an optimistic tone: ""I'm encouraged with the significant improvement but we're not without challenges there.""He also said that sales would have been stronger if demand for the more expensive iPhone 7 Plus hadn't been underestimated. As it turned out, the more expensive device was more popular based on new features like better cameras and more RAM, which therefore led to a supply shortage. If it wasn't such a competitive market, this may not have been such a bad problem to have.However, it does reverse an earlier trend that saw the iPhone 6S Plus and iPhone 6 Plus growing slower than their less expensive partners. It also seems to indicate that customers are unwilling to upgrade without meaningful new features, but will pay more for them when they're there.As a result, the two new models that also came with water resistance while ditching the headphone socket accounted for 17% of iPhone sales, according to research firm Localytics, as reported in the media. This also raised the average selling price to $695 from $691 in the year-ago quarter.The Good and Bad Going ForwardSmartphone sales growth rates are not going to come back to where they've been the last few years. For example, consider that the iPhone 6 launch in Sep 2014 was followed by a 46% increase in shipments the following quarter. This kind of growth is history, because penetration continues to increase across the world.Second, Apple's growth rates have also been fueled by market share gains in China, which may not be repeated for a number of reasons including greater penetration, the stronger dollar, a more difficult operating environment, the increasingly strained relations between China and the U.S. and the abundant supply of local makes of varying price tags.Third, Apple is likely to maintain or even grow share in developed markets and markets with higher penetration on the strength of its brand. But these upgrades will be dependent on innovation. Tim Cook says: ""The smartphone is still in the early innings of the game,"" and ""I think there's lots more to do... We've got some exciting things in the pipeline. I still feel really, really good about it."" But if the upgrades over the past two years are anything to go by, it seems that there's a limit to that innovation.That of course brings us to the question of the upcoming iPhone 8 that is expected to have an all-new design, glass casing and other exciting features. Plus, it's the iPhone's 10thanniversary, so there's some pent-up excitement there. If Apple delivers in line with the hype, it should have blockbuster sales. Beginning in the September quarter when it will launch that is and provided Apple doesn't under-supply the things. Until then, we should expect customers to hold off purchases (more so than in earlier years because the excitement for the new phone is more this time).The other somewhat positive factor is India where Apple's talks with government officials appear to be going well. India is a faster-growing market than China at the moment because of relatively lower penetration, a rising middle class and the Prime Minister's stated goal of digitizing the nation. Once Apple starts building its stores in the region, its brand value is bound to appreciate and translate into increased sales for the company. But it's not a done deal yet, especially considering the concessions Apple is asking for, so some uncertainty persists.Apple shares currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) Stock Dip Beckons to Profit-Seekers;February 02, 2017, 10:58:44 AM EDT;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTraders seeking strength are flocking to theNasdaqin droves. The tech-laden index continues to be the best looking of the bunch, and its dominance has only increased during earnings season. Solid performance fromApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) toMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) following their respective earnings releases has helped keep the good times rolling. But do you know which heavy hitter may be sporting the best opportunity right now?International Business Machines Corp.(NYSE:IBM).makeArticleAd();Source:Open Grid Scheduler Via FlickrLet's take a deep dive into the chart of IBM stock to see what kind of trade we can drum up.Like the lion's share of the equities market, IBM jumped into an uptrend following last year's election and it hasn't looked back since. The tech titan entered the new year with a solid high base pattern that created a breakout opportunity for technical traders.And they didn't have to wait long. Big Blue's earnings beat from Jan. 19 served as the excuse for buyers to come rushing in.The action in IBM stock since then has been textbook. After breaching the $170 resistance level, the stock gained a quick ten bucks before the bulls' fury finally faded.5 Safe Dividend Stocks to Buy for RetirementSince then, mild profit-taking has created an attractive four-day pullback. Traders loath to chase now have their opportunity to scoop up shares at a discount.Source: OptionsAnalytixRecent volume patterns have also been favoring buyers. The post-earnings breakout was accompanied by a handful of accumulation days suggesting institutions were entering the fray with aggression. And while the stock has retreated in recent days, the volume has been muted suggesting a lack of any real conviction by sellers here.Throw it all together, and this IBM stock dip looks like a buy.IBM Stock Calendars, Anyone?With earnings fading in the distance, IBM options have become cheap again. And that means long option trades carry much less risk. Let's build a calendar spread to capitalize on further upside in the stock over the coming month.First, buy to open the Apr $170 call for around $7.60. Then, sell to open the Mar $180 call for around $1.25. This creates a diagonal call spread for a net debit of $6.35. The max loss is limited to the initial debit and will be forfeited if IBM sits below $170 at Apr expiration.Why Sony Corp (ADR) (SNE) Stock Should Ditch the Entertainment BizTo minimize the loss, I suggest exiting if the stock breaks the $165 support level.The max profit is around $400 and will be captured if IBM sits right at $180 at March expiration. Since the April option will only have one month remaining at March expiration, I suggesting exiting at that point.At the time of this writing, Tyler Craig had no positions in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace5 Stocks to Buy to Defy a Weak FebruaryThe 5 Best Stocks to Buy for Big Emerging Markets ProfitsThe postThe International Business Machines Corp.

Why Sony Corp (ADR) (SNE) Stock Should Ditch the Entertainment Biz;February 02, 2017, 10:32:03 AM EDT;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSony Corp (ADR)(NYSE:SNE) saw some great movement back in 2013 when activist investor Dan Loeb delivered ahand-written letterto CEO Kazuo Hirai. In that letter, Loeb, petitioned for Sony to spin off its entertainment division, which includes movies, television and music. Loeb believed the move would increase the value of Sony stock and reward shareholders  and another weak quarter for the division makes that memory all the more painful.makeArticleAd();Source:WikipediaLoeb has since sold his stake, after being the largest shareholder with 6% of shares, but new rumors see Sony selling off part of the unit. SNE stock is ready to roll in 2017 if this move finally comes into play.TheNew York Postreports that Sony is listening to pitches from interested parties in the Sony Entertainment division. Rumors seeCBS Corporation(NYSE:CBS), a Chinese media company, or a technology company likeApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) orFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) acquiring this asset from Sony.An outright sale of the division that includes movies and television would differ from Loeb's original plan, which called for the entertainment unit going public and including Sony Music.On Thursday, Sony reported a weak fiscal third quarter due to the movies division. SNE lost $913 million in the pictures division - thanks to a $962 million write-down - bringing Q3 profits down to $169 million. Even without the one time event, the division was very weak compared to last year's third quarter, which thrived thanks to the James Bond installmentSpectre.Why a Sony Entertainment Sale Could Still WorkThose results aside, though, the Sony Entertainment division is incredibly valuable in today's content monetization world. The company creates movies and television series - and naturally could produce more - that would fit well for many acquiring companies. Within Sony, this division often is buried under a focus on video games, televisions, and smartphone technology.5 Stocks to Buy to Defy a Weak FebruarySNE has struggled to produce high box-office gross from its movie division, but that could change with its 2017 lineup. This year, the studio will release sequels to movies likeTrainspottingandSmurfs. The studio will also release a remake ofJumanji, with a prominent Dec. 22 opening date. Along with theSmurfs: The Lost Village, Sony is betting on its animated offerings with other titlesThe Emoji MovieandThe Staralso coming in 2017.While some reports say Sony is waiting to sell the division until it sees how strong the opening ofThe Emoji Movieis, I have to believe that they are waiting for another small movie coming out on July 7. You might have heard of it. It's calledSpider-Man: Homecoming. Sony has had better luck in terms of overall box office revenue and market share in years when a Spider-Man movie has been released.This could be the perfect time to monetize the entertainment division for the company and reward owners of SNE stock.In2016, Sony held only an 8.3% market share of the U.S. box office with $943.5 million grossed from 36 movies. This was the highest number of movies released among the main studios. Sony ranked well behindWalt Disney Co(NYSE:DIS),Time Warner Inc.(NYSE:TWX),NBC/UniversalandNews Corp's(NASDAQ:NWSA) Fox, who all grossed more than $1.5 billion domestically during the year. Only two Sony movies (GhostbustersandAngry Birds) grossed more than $100 million domestically.This has been a common theme, and also one of the reasons why the entertainment division is so unpredictable for a large technology company like Sony. In 2015, the studio barely cleared $1 billion thanks to two decent-performing movies inSpectreandHotel Transylvania2.A Big Lineup AheadAs mentioned above, releasing a Spider-Man movie has been a good thing for SNE and could lift Sony stock soon.Back in 2014, Sony finished fourth with a market share of 12% and $1.3 billion domestically.The Amazing Spider-Man 2grossed $202.9 million domestically and another $506.1 million internationally. In 2012, Sony ranked second at the box office with a 16.5% market share and $1.8 billion in domestic box office revenue.SkyfallandThe Amazing Spider-Manled the way with $291 million and $262 million, respectively.The Amazing Spider-Mangrossed an additional $496 million in international markets.Along with a strong 2017 planned, Sony's movie division is also releasing additional Spider-Man movies,Bad Boys 3,Bad Boys 4,Hotel Transylvania 3,Goosebumps 2,Barbieand more animated movies. Other intellectual properties owned include Charlie's Angels, 21 Jump Street, Ghostbusters, The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo and Men in Black.Make Bank of America Corp (BAC) Stock a Great Trade AgainThe time for SNE to sell this asset could absolutely be now as it has a decent pipeline, can capitalize on the Spider-Man results, and may full well know the best is behind it. The company lost the rights to the James Bond movies and has only released two of its top 10 grossing movies since 2010 (SkyfallandThe Amazing Spider-Man).Sony Entertainment has more to offer a new owner than just movies. The division also produces and distributes television shows, and has a handful of media networks, with a strong presence internationally. The division's global footprint covers 178 countries and more than 1.4 billion subscribers.Hit television shows under the Sony umbrella includeBetterCall Saul,Jeopardy,BlackishandShark Tank. The television division has really grown, and could be the biggest reason this asset is undervalued, and sets up a big win for Sony stock. In the 2015-16 season, Sony had 33 series on the air. That is a sharp increase from the 15 a decade ago in 2005-06.Bottom Line for Sony StockAdd it all up and you have a top five movie studio, an increasing producer of original content for numerous channels, owner of strong intellectual property and syndicated programs, and an international television channel owner. Those assets will make Sony's Entertainment arm incredibly valuable to CBS, a Chinese media company or whoever is currently sniffing around.Sony may be hesitant to let go of the entertainment arm that has helped to make up for weakness in the electronics markets in years past. Thursday's Q3, however, showed just how much trouble the movie business is in.The company should capitalize on its upcoming slate and reward Sony stock holders shareholders with a sale of the division.As of this writing, Chris Katje did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceThe 5 Best Stocks to Buy for Big Emerging Markets ProfitsThe 10 Best Stocks to Buy for 2017: The Experts' PicksThe Top 10 Dow Dividend Stocks for FebruaryThe postWhy Sony Corp (ADR) (SNE) Stock Should Ditch the Entertainment Bizappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Google Earnings: The Market Has Made The Same Mistake Twice;February 02, 2017, 10:07:59 AM EDT;"Google Earnings (Shutterstock photo)As a general rule, the market is pretty good about learning from its mistakes. After all, there is nothing like a hefty loss to teach traders what not to do.That is a simple fact that must be borne in mind when looking for patterns in pricing; if the pattern involves a reaction to news that was ultimately proven wrong, it is unlikely to repeat very often, and the few opportunities when it does should be grabbed with both hands.makeArticleAd();That is what makes Google parent company Alphabet (GOOG:GOOGL) look like such a good buy after its reaction to Q4 earnings.As you can see from the chart below, prior to last weeks earnings report Google (Im sorry but I just cant bring myself to call the company Alphabet) had dropped sharply on earnings misses contained in two of the previous three releases, in April and October.On both of those occasions, though, the big drop in price was, with the benefit of 20/20 hindsight, an opportunity to buy the stock at a discount. There are different circumstances this time around, of course, but the dynamic that has made negative reactions to earnings in the past opportunities is still in place, so the end result is likely to be the same.The biggest problems with the Q4 results as far as traders were concerned, it seems, were that cost per click was down, and operating costs had risen to the point where earnings per Class A share (EPS) of $9.36 fell short of the Streets estimates of around $9.64. Still, revenues of $26.06 billion beat the estimated $25.26 billion.There was also a concern lurking in the background regarding Google taking on both Amazon (AMZN)s Echo and Apple (AAPL)s iPhone with recent hardware launches. Google said that they were pleased with the reaction to both Google Home and the Pixel phone without going into specifics, but doubts about the wisdom of the strategy persist.I actually believe that Google has a chance of limited success in each case. The Pixel will be the most uphill struggle as the iPhones dominance of the mobile phone market is well established. Most estimates of sales of the phone so far are around 1 million, which hardly puts a dent in the iPhone, but may prove to be enough of a base to make the Pixel profitable as a niche product.Home has an easier, more logical path to success as Google is the natural choice of those looking for what is, essentially, a free-standing search engine.Ultimately, though, neither Home nor Pixel is going to be the driver of the recovery in the stock price that history suggests will come soon.First, the increase in operating costs that Google reported seems, on a breakdown of the numbers, to be the result of investment in the core business. Losses in what the company calls Other Bets, things like Nest and self driving cars, were actually reduced somewhat in the fourth quarter, but there was significant progress on the autonomous vehicle front.The possibilities of that field are endless and Google, along with Tesla (TSLA) and Apple, are generally seen as the leaders in driverless car research and technology.The other issue, of falling cost per click (CPC), is also not what it seems on the surface. It reflects a continuing move to mobile that results in that metric falling, but the volume of clicks increasing. The same issue was, in part, responsible for the April and October drops in GOOG after earnings, and the chart tells the story of how long it was until investors realized that volume more than offset falling CPC.Looking at Googles results and the market reaction to them, I get a sense of dj vu. We have actually been here before, twice, and each time the drop in GOOG gave investors a chance to buy cheaply. It seems that in this case the market is still learning from its mistake and over time the outcome here is most likely to be the same."
Make Bank of America Corp (BAC) Stock a Great Trade Again;February 02, 2017, 10:01:03 AM EDT;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAyuuugenarrative inBank of America Corp(NYSE:BAC) and other financials has lost a bit of steam in recent days. Nevertheless and as you'll soon see, that's a very good thing for shares  and even better if you're willing to trade BAC stock.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');Source:Mike Mozart via FlickrToday, I have an idea for some financial engineering that won't break the bank.Following a massive rally spurred by President Trump-inspired idealism on everything from deregulation to a corporate tax boon to beneficial re-inflation conditions, BAC stock has gone nowhereveryfast over the past few weeks.Investors are now busy backtracking on a bit of the market's notorious perfect pricing mechanism. That has put a lid on BofA. A newer, bearish narrative of protectionist policies and potential trade wars have been stealing the spotlight in recent days since the new administration took the reins.At the end of the day, market narratives happen all the time. It's the gray in-between area where history is eventually written.5 Stocks to Buy to Defy a Weak FebruaryMaybe Goldman Sachs knows what tomorrow, next week or the next four years look like, but it's good to have an investment backstop - like options on BAC stock - rather than rely too aggressively on the""Trump put.""BAC Stock ChartClick to EnlargeBank of America hasremoved the downside risksassociated with an extremely overbought condition. What's more, the price action also indicates a breakout and rally are imminent.Admittedly, our prior technical case of BAC - prone to a corrective move into the $20-$21 area - proved too ambitious with a low of $21.77 for the period. But as both price and time are important factors in determining a correction; some good work has been provided in Bank of America.Subsequent price movement in BAC stock has consolidated brisk gains of around 35% to establish a neutral, but constructive seven- to eight-week flat base pattern. So while the depth of BofA's correction came up short of our forecast, the duration spent and firmness of the bid suggests the upside outweighs the downside risks at this juncture.Now, for the trade.How to Trade BAC Stock HereGiven the continued supportive dynamics working hard to make BofA great again, and the removal of earnings risk, I like a modified collar combination right now.Sell an Apr $25 call and buy the Apr $22/$20 bear put spread for $23.10, as of BAC's current price of $23.02. A bullish investor maintains about 8.5% of upside into April expiration with the sold $25 call capping profits at $1.90 per spread.The max gain on BAC is unadjusted and on an expiration basis, with the potential for larger gains by rolling the position beyond the initial hedge.Why Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock Will NEVER Be About P/EOn the flipside, if BAC stock fails to move higher and declines in price, the bear put spread portion of the combo affords the trader a partial but very effective hedge from $20-$22.Under ideal conditions, the spread works to buffer the loss in share price, dollar-for-dollar. But even during a less agreeable price swing lower, this modified collar should greatly curtail downside risk on BAC stock - and in our view trumps other alternatives quite nicely.Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in any of the securities or their derivatives mentioned in this article.

The site raked in $8.83 billion, higher than the $8.52 billion that analysts expected. Earnings came in at a stellar $1.41 per share, which was well ahead of the $1.31 per share that analysts polled byThomson Reuterswere calling for over the three months.5 Stocks to Buy to Defy a Weak FebruaryOne of the most important milestones that Facebook reached to end the year came in the form of its active monthly users around the globe, which rose to 1.86 billion. The figure was slightly ahead of the 1.84 billion that was projected. Active daily users amounted to 1.23 billion by the end of the month, about 40 million higher than estimates.FB grew 0.7% after hours Wednesday, but Facebook stock is down 1.2% today.Metlife Inc (MET)Metlife's quarterly figuresmissed the markWednesday afternoon. The insurance company announced that it earned $1.28 per share, which was weaker than the $1.35 per share that Wall Street was expecting, according to analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Operating profit for the period came in at $1.42 billion, which was $40 million higher than what Metlife posted the prior year in the same quarter. Overall, the company posted a net loss of $2.09 billion.The disappointing results can be partially attributed to the company's decision to increase interest rates, which reduced the carrying value of its derivatives book. Investment income was a bright spot, enjoying a 2.5% boost to $5.04 billion. Operating earnings in Europe and Asia were also strong, wafting up 33.3% and 22%, respectively.MET stock fell 1.6% after the bell yesterday, and is down 5.2% in early morning trading.Symantec Corporation (SYMC)Symantec Operation had mixed results for itsfiscal third quarterof 2016.Earnings minus items came in at 32 cents per share, rising 23% compared to the third quarter of 2015. The figure topped analysts' non-GAAP profit of 28 cents per share. Revenue was slightly higher than projections at $1.09 billion, beating the consensus estimate by $10 million.The security software company raked in some profit from its 2016 acquisition of Blue Coat Systems for $4.65 billion. The company also bought LifeLock for $2.3 billion, improving the its identity-theft protection services segment.Apple Inc. Bulls: Beware These Charts! (AAPL)For the current quarter, Symantec expects to bring in earnings of 28 cents per share. Meanwhile, revenue will be similar at around $1.08 billion.SYMC shares dipped 0.1% after Tuesday's market close, and is currently down 1.1% Thursday.

Thursdays Vital Data: Apple Inc. (AAPL), Facebook Inc (FB) and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD);February 02, 2017, 09:29:01 AM EDT;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe bloom is off the rose for the ""Trump rally,"" and Wall Street is finally taking the new administration at its word as U.S. stock futures are headed broadly lower this morning. A string of geopolitical issues from President Donald Trump has traders worried, including potentialnew sanctions on Iran, the threat ofsending troops to Mexicoand a heated exchange with the Australian prime minister.makeArticleAd();As a result, futures on theDow Jones Industrial Averageare down 0.23%,S&P 500futures are off 0.22% andNasdaq-100futures have fallen 0.23%.On the options front, call activity rebounded amid a string of strong quarterly reports from the tech sector. Overall, about 16.5 million calls and 14.2 million puts crossed the tape yesterday. On the CBOE, however, put activity remained a potent driver, with the single-session equity put/call volume ratio arriving at 0.71 and the 10-day moving average hitting another three-month high of 0.69.As for Wednesday's volume leaders,Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) call options chased yesterday's post-earnings rally as the company offered up a much-needed win. Elsewhere,Facebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) also drew heavy call volume ahead of last night's quarterly report andAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMD) extended its blistering 12-month rally to more than 430% on the heels of another blowout quarter.Apple Inc. (AAPL)After posting three straight quarters of declining revenue and faltering earnings, Apple finally hit it big. For the holiday quarter, Apple said it earned $3.36 per share on revenue of $78.4 billion, easily besting expectations for $3.22 per share on revenue of $77.42 billion.5 Stocks to Buy to Defy a Weak FebruaryAccording to CEO Tim Cook, the results were ""Apple's highest quarterly revenue ever and broke multiple records along the way. We sold more iPhones than ever before and set all-time revenue records for iPhone, Services, Mac and Apple Watch.""But while AAPL options traders attempted to chase the rally with calls, Wednesday's post-earnings call volume (as a percentage of total volume) still came in light. Total volume reached a whopping 3.34 million contracts yesterday, with calls accounting for a below average 61% of the day's take. Still, 3.34 million contracts is quite impressive, and adds up to quite a lot of call activity on AAPL stock.On the other hand, some traders appear to be fading the rally already, as open interest at the 3 Feb $128 and $127 strikes surged to more than 10,000 contracts each. AAPL is trading slightly lower in premarket action this morning, and broad market headwinds could place these puts in the money by weeks end.Facebook Inc (FB)Facebook stepped into the earnings limelight after the close last night to post itsseventh-straight earnings beat. The company said sales surged 53% to $8.83 billion, with earnings arriving at $1.41 per share. Wall Street was expecting earnings of $1.31 per share on revenue of $8.52 billion. Additionally, daily active users (DAUs) rose 18% to 1.23 billion, mobile DAUs were up 23% at 1.15 billion and mobile ad revenue came in at 84% of all advertising revenue.FB stock options traders were quite bullish heading into the report, with calls accounting for 64% of the nearly 1.6 million contracts traded. FB is trading roughly 0.6% higher this morning, with the shares set to open in record high territory north of $135.Currently, there are 12,700 calls open at the $135 strike in the 3 Feb series, with another 12,000 at $137 and 12,700 at the $140 strike. If buying pressure can overcome broad market headwinds, FB could make a run at $137, but $140 may be unreachable until the end of next week.Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD)AMD solidified its position in the semiconductor hot seat yesterday when the company blew past Wall Street's fourth-quarter earnings expectations.For the quarter, AMD narrowed its loss to a penny per share on revenue of $1.11 billion, compared to expectations for a loss of two cents per share on $1.07 billion in sales.What's more, AMD said its Ryzen should hit shelves by March and that the much-anticipated graphics processor should boost revenue by 18%.Why Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock Will NEVER Be About P/EAMD options traders were all over call contracts yesterday, with these typically bullish best making up 66% of the 712,000 contracts traded - well above average for AMD. As of yesterday's close, the stock is trading north of all but the most bullish of heavy call OI strikes in the Feb. series, with 1,400 contracts at $12.50 and 1,100 at $13.However, there is a bit of profit taking going on this morning, with AMD pulling back by about 1.5% amid broad market selling pressure. Profit taking might not be a bad idea at the moment, as a consolidation period is warranted after yesterday's 16% surge.As of this writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceThe Top 10 Dow Dividend Stocks for FebruaryThe 5 Best Stocks to Buy for Big Emerging Markets ProfitsThe postThursday's Vital Data: Apple Inc.

Are Garmin Ltd. (GRMN) and Fitbit Inc (FIT) the Perfect Long/Short Play?;February 02, 2017, 09:27:59 AM EDT;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsRecent statistics from the two wearable rivals suggest thatGarmin Ltd.(NASDAQ:GRMN) is winning the war againstFitbit Inc(NYSE:FIT), making a hypothetical long/short play between the two stocks a very interesting proposition.makeArticleAd();Source:Via FitbitHowever, thinking about buying Garmin and shorting Fitbit stock - and actually following through with it - are two entirely different beasts.I have never shorted a stock and likely never will; I'm just not built that way. Whenever I'm asked byInvestorPlace, or any of the other financial publications I write for, to do a ""sell"" piece on a stock or a group of stocks, I always have a tougher time coming up with recommendations.I like to write about stocks that I would consider owning; negative spin doesn't enter my psyche. I can do it, it's just harder.This brings me to GRMN stock and FIT stock, the crux of this story.Why Fitbit Inc (FIT) Stock Can't Fall Much Lower Than ThisIn Q3 2016, Garmin shipped 1.3 million wearable devices, a 12.2% year-over-year increase. That compares to an 11.0% YOY increase for Fitbit. In Q2 2016, Garmin shipped 1.6 million wearable devices, a 106.7% increase over the same quarter a year earlier, while Fitbit shipped 5.7 million wearable devices, a 28.7% increase over the same quarter a year earlier.So, in the nine months ended September 2016, Garmin shipped 3.8 million wearable devices, a 40.7% increase year over year. Meanwhile, Fitbit shipped 15.8 million wearable devices, a 21.5% increase year over year.Between Q1 2015 and Q3 2016, Garmin's market share dropped by 40 basis points to 5.7%. During the same 18-month period, Fitbit's market share dropped 980 basis points to 23.0%.Fitbit Stock Continues to DeclineSamsung Electronics(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) and the many others that compete for the 50% market share not held by Fitbit,Xiaomi, Garmin, andApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) stand to benefit the most.Garmin is a big company and wearables are but one of many revenue streams. A 40-basis-point decline isn't a big deal for a company that generated $2.2 billion in revenue in the first nine months of fiscal 2016, an increase of 5.8%. If not for its auto segment (its largest by revenue), which saw a 17% decline year over year to $656.0 million, 2016 has been a winner.Over at Fitbit, the top line has been outstanding, with revenue growing 39.3% through the first nine months of the year to $1.6 billion. However, it's the bottom line that gets a little wonky.In the quarter ended Oct. 1, 2016, Fitbit's operating profit declined 33.1% to $44.4 million; for the nine months ended October 1, 2016, operating income declined 69.3% to $72.9 million. R&D, sales and marketing, and G&A expenses all have seen huge increases in 2016 as Fitbit struggles to remain on top of a wearables market that's slowing faster than anyone expected.InvestorPlacecontributor Aaron Levitt recently discussed Fitbit stock in relation to aslowing wearables market; he was pretty blunt in his assessment of the job CEO James Park is doing guiding the company through a rough patch that's seen FIT stock decline by 65% over the past year.""Both eMarketer and IDC both cite smartwatches as the big reason for the declines,"" wrote Levitt. ""Consumers just can't see the need for them as they overlap on features already found in smartphones. And when adding their heftier price tags, smartwatches are a fading fad.""So, what does Fitbit do to counter the fact that wearables' 2016 growth will be less than half the 60% projection at the start of the year? It buys not one, but two companies that make smartwatches.Bottom Line on Fitbit and GarminIf Fitbit continues to waste money on bad acquisitions and wasteful overhead that doesn't move the needle, you can bet that Fitbit's comfy cash position - $672 million in cash and marketable securities as of Q3 - will be gone faster than you can shake a stick at.So, should you go long on Garmin? Absolutely. With$1.1 billionin cash and marketable securities, no debt, and an operating margin of almost 21%, GRMN stock is a long-term hold.3 Stocks to Buy for Better Deals Than the Great RecessionAs for shorting FIT stock, I'm of two minds on this.Yes, theshorts represent almost 36% of its floatand its margins are about one-third Garmin's, but with $3 in cash it's got to be attractive to somebody in the industry - maybe even Garmin. That should keep Fitbit stock from dropping much farther.So, I wouldn't recommend investors buy or short Fitbit stock. Neither proposition looks like it will be a winner any time soon.More From InvestorPlaceThe 5 Best Stocks to Buy for Big Emerging Markets ProfitsHere's How Apple Inc.

Why Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock Will NEVER Be About P/E;February 02, 2017, 09:08:52 AM EDT;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOne of the biggest negatives surroundingAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) is the company's sky-high price-to-earnings ratio. According to Google Finance, AMZN stock currently trades at an eye-popping 191 times its trailing earnings of $4.36 per share.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockBut Amazon has at least given investors the courtesy of growing profits to try to somewhat justify the lofty valuation. That 191x is on trailing 12-month earnings of $4.36 per share. In fiscal 2015, AMZN earned $596 million, or $1.25 per share. In 2014, it lost $241 million, which translates into 52 cents per share.It's obvious Amazon stock investors care about growth, not valuation. AMZN's sky-high P/E has been in place for years, and will likely continue for some time.And that's actually OK. Here are two important reasons why:Amazon Revenue GrowthAmazon is still one of the best growth stories in today's market.When the company releases 2016's final numbers Thursday, Feb. 2, analysts expect Amazon to post revenue of $137 billion. That's an improvement of more than 25% versus 2015's top line - a difficult feat when you're talking about 12-digit sales. And Amazon's $107 billion in revenue last year was 20% better than 2014.5 Stocks to Buy to Defy a Weak FebruaryWe live in a world in whichS&P 500constituents are doing well if they're posting just single-digit increases on the top line. You can blame this at least partly on the strong U.S. dollar, which is weighing down American multinationals. But the fact remains that meaningful growth is a scarce quality in today's stock market - especially among blue-chip stocks.Thus, AMZN stock is an easy way for investors to get access to big growth with relatively little risk.And Amazon is hardly running out of fuel. The company has only begun to expand into grocery and apparel - two huge categories. Trillions of dollars are spent worldwide each year at physical stores. That's not to mention the other gains Amazon still could make via the smart home, Amazon Web Services cloud offerings and other newer initiatives.Analysts predict Amazon's revenue will increase another 22% in 2017, hitting $168 billion. So again - the growth story is still well intact.But it's not all about growth. Many AMZN stock bulls argue that we're just looking at earnings the wrong way.Amazon Earnings: Better Than They Seem?One thing that separates Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos from many other executives is his ability to look at the really,reallylong-term. He's also willing to spend billions of dollars on ideas, and is OK with hitting a few duds if it means spawning great new ideas.Remember the company's smartphone? The Amazon Music Importer? How about a website called Askville? I'm guessing you might remember the Fire smartphone, but not the other two. Amazon lost $170 million on its smartphone alone.This kind of risk taking is an inherent part of Amazon's culture. It's the line of thinking that prodded the company to introduce some of its biggest winners to date, like cloud services, Prime shipping and the Kindle.Thus, many investors look at AMZN stock in a different way. They look at the company's operating profit, then they add back its substantial research and development costs to get a ""truer"" sense of profitability.Admittedly, that changes the picture dramatically.Apple Inc. Bulls: Beware These Charts! (AAPL)In its most recent quarter, Amazon produced net income of $252 million, which across 485 million diluted shares became diluted earnings of 52 cents per share. At the time, AMZN was trading at $822 per share. If we annualize that profit (not a perfect measure, as quarterly earnings fluctuate - this is just for an example), we're looking at a P/E of 395.But Amazon also reported operating profits of $575 million, and spent $4.14 billion on R&D - a significant expense. Add those together, and you get $4.715 billion, or $9.72 per share. Annualize that, then divide the share price by that, and you get a P/E of about 21.Let's take the actual numbers. Amazon currently trades for 190 times trailing 12-month earnings, as we said above. However, over the past four quarters, Amazon spent $15.11 billion on R&D and posted operating profits of more than $4 billion. That comes to $40.19 per share combined, and puts AMZN stock at a P/E of just more than 20.That's a lot of creative accounting, so take that with a spoonful of salt. But it's an interesting argument.Bottom Line on AMZN StockAmazon continues to be one of the best growth stories in today's market. As long as that continues, investors aren't going to care about the headline P/E ratio. It just doesn't matter. AMZN stock has doubled several times over despite it.Amazon is solidly profitable, even if the bottom line isn't as large as investors typically would like. But those earnings are being reinvested back in the business - which is what a high-growth company like Amazon should be doing anyway.As of this writing, Nelson Smith did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceWhy Amazon.com, Inc.

Apple Inc. Bulls: Beware These Charts! (AAPL);February 02, 2017, 08:15:22 AM EDT;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsShares ofApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) rallied a strong 6% on Wednesday following the company's latest earnings report. While the rally was impressive, AAPL stock is now bumping into some critical technical resistance that bulls and bears alike should be aware of.makeArticleAd();Simply put, Apple's near- to possibly medium-term upside is limited at best.Apple's revenues in the latest quarter came in at a record $78.4 billion, which in part was helped by strong holiday demand for the new iPhone 7 series. These numbers are impressive, and I continue to be a longer-term believer in the company - particularly around the potential of AAPL being able to monetize deeper on the devices ecosystem through more services.When Ilast discussed shares of Appleon Dec. 28, 2016, I offered that if AAPL stock could clear above the $118 price level, then a next upside target around $123 would come into sight. Apple met and surpassed this target on Wednesday following the earnings announcement.From that perspective, Apple shares have now reached an important upside price target.AAPL Stock ChartsLet's take a step back and look at the multiyear weekly chart of AAPL stock. We see that despite the big swing lower from the 2015 highs into the mid-2016 lows, and most recently back up toward the 2015 highs, Apple has, largely speaking, not really accomplished much since early 2015.Click to EnlargeBulls, however, note that the May 2016 lows coincided with critical technical support made up of horizontal support (lower purple-dotted line) as well as the 200-week simple moving average (red). Equally important, on the other hand, is that after Wednesday's post-earnings rally, AAPL is now within a few points of these aforementioned previous all-time highs from 2015. Through a technical lens, this could offer up as much resistance as the 2015 lows offered support.In other words, before Apple stock can sustainably break to new all-time highs, a consolidation phase most likely is in order.Looking at the daily chart, we see that since mid-November 2016, AAPL stock has now rallied approximately 25%, which is not a small move for the stock to accomplish in a matter of two-and-a-half months.Click to EnlargeA simple yet accurate observation through the lens of technical analysis is that old all-time highs are not easily overcome on the first try, particularly if the stock has not consolidated below or near those previous all-time highs for some time.Apple's current chart thus is in dire need of some consolidation before it can make a better attempt at fresh all-time highs on a more sustainable basis.How to Trade Apple Stock HereI see two specific trades setting up:If AAPL stock breaks and holds below Wednesday's intraday lows around $127, then the stock could be played from the short side for a mean-reversion move back into the mid- to low $120s. Alternatively, options traders could also look to sell out-of-the-money call spreads on the stock at that time.Quicker traders could look to buy AAPL stock for fast profits should the stock push and hold above Wednesday's intraday highs around $130.50 for a move toward the 2015 highs around $133.Either way, upside in AAPL stock through a multiweek/multimonth lens is likely limited. Trades should be constructed accordingly.Like what you see? Sign up for our dailyBeat the Belle-letter and get Serge's investment advice delivered to your inbox every morning!

The S&P 500 Holds in the Face of Uncertainty;February 02, 2017, 08:12:48 AM EDT;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOn Wednesday, shares ofApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) jumped 6.1% following a report that showed an increased demand for its iPhone 7. The record increase in revenues of $78.4 billion ended a record of three consecutive quarters of declines, and helped theDow Jones Industrial Averagegain 0.1% by adding 51 points to the index. Apple's gain also helped propel theNasdaqto a gain for the day of 0.5%.makeArticleAd();Apple's gain helped the session to open higher, but the positive impact of one stock's opening didn't' last long. All of the gains of the opening were lost by noon. However, following the noon hour's lows, a Federal Reserve decision to leave interest rates unchanged, and several positive economic reports helped gain back about half of the morning's losses enabling the major indices to close with modest gains.5 Stocks to Buy to Defy a Weak FebruaryAt the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 27 points at 19,891, theS&P 500eked out a point at 2,280, the Nasdaq rose 28 points to close at 5,643 and theRussell 2000closed at 1,361, unchanged. The NYSE's primary exchange traded 1 billion shares with total volume of 3.9 billion shares. The Nasdaq crossed 2.2 billion shares. On the Big Board, decliners edged out advancers by 1.1-to-1, while the Nasdaq broke even. The NYSE's blocks were reported as 6,510 down from 6,786 on Tuesday.Click to EnlargeIn spite of the many underlying uncertainties, the S&P 500 (and the Nasdaq) have maintained support. The S&P 500's December high at 2,277 is the ""line in the sand"" for this major index, as is Nasdaq's January high at 5,574.Conclusion:The January closing highs of the major indices are breakout points that must hold if the short-term and intermediate-term trend is to remain intact.A gap exists on the 500 from 2,292 to 2,286. That gap was partially closed by yesterday's intraday high at 2,289. This technical issue is an important focus for this major index, since a failure to proceed higher could easily lead to a 5% to 10% correction. So far the major indices have resisted the anxiety produced by many uncertainties, choosing to hold or buy rather than give in to the sellers.The line at 2,277 was pierced but recovered. The question now is, ""Can it hold?""Today's Trading LandscapeTo see a list of the companies reporting earnings today,click here.For a list of this week's economic reports due out,click here.Tell us what you think about this article!

5 Top Dividend Aristocrats to Buy in February;February 02, 2017, 08:09:00 AM EDT;"makeZacksArticleAd();The Federal Reserve maintained interest rates in February, providing no update on the next hike. The Fed's reluctance in raising rates should stand in good stead for dividend aristocrats.President Donald Trump's travel ban, in the meanwhile, could result in a possible rise in erratic share price movement this month. The stock market has also, traditionally, seen weak results this month, especially after an election. In such a scenario, investing in dividend aristocrats  seems prudent as they provide higher total returns with lower volatility, which are undoubtedly the 'holy grail' of investing.Fed Leaves Rates UnchangedAs widely expected, the Fed has kept rates unchanged following a two-day policy meeting on Feb 1. The central bank kept its benchmark overnight lending rate target at a range of 0.5% to 0.75%. The bank had lifted rates by a quarter percentage point in December, marking the second hike in more than 10 years.In fact, the central bank penciled three quarter-point moves this year in December. More importantly for investors, the central bank didn't drop any hints of raising rates in the March meet, placing the probability of such a move at only 18%, according to CME Group.In this case, high qualitydividend stockshave become more appealing as their stock prices don't suffer when rates aren't rising. Conversely, bond markets, which tend to benefit from a rise in interest rates, have lost its lure.Trump Stirs Up a TempestThe Fed's positive view of the economy and Apple Inc.'sAAPLstellar earnings helped stocks rally a little higher on Feb 1. However, investors have not yet recovered from the blow of Trump's immigration ban. An executive order by Trump banned immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries, including legal residents and visa holders. Trump had earlier fostered expectations that his administration will be business friendly and therefore should bode well for the equity market. This decision has drawn congressional criticism and widespread protests. These protectionist measures may also cloud the path for pro-business initiatives as several world and corporate leaders condemn the ban.Airlines bore the brunt as well as several airports across the country saw violent protests, disrupting operations to a great extent. Tech firms also faced obstacles in sourcing labor from foreign lands. Trump's first press conference since July also disappointed investors due to lack of policy detail. He severely criticized pharmaceutical companies over high drug prices, dealing a blow to leading biotech stocks.Such uncertainties make dividend paying stocks more attractive as they tend to outperform when the broader markets are subject to gyrations. Notably, the month of February has traditionally seen weak numbers just after the election.February: Traditionally a Weak MonthFebruary has been the weakest month for stocks over the past four decades, averaging just a 0.06% gain. In fact, in post-election years, February tends to be weaker. The average return has decreased 1.85% since 1977.Lest we forget, markets have gone 74 days without a 1% daily decline, hence, the seasonality pattern increases the odds of a wider decline in February.Why Dividend Aristocrats? 5 Solid ChoicesDividend aristocrats outperform other dividend payers on better quality business. This category of stocks reflect a solid financial structure and healthy underlying fundamentals. Such stocks are immune to market vagaries and have also raked in excellent risk-adjusted returns over the last decade. In fact, in the last one year, the S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats Index rallied 19.6%, above the S&P 500's 17.5%.Dividend Aristocrats generated an annualized return of 9.7% over the past 10 years, easily topping the broader market's 6.3% rate. During this period, dividends accounted for 31% of the market's total return, highlighting their importance in determining total shareholder return.We have, thus, selected five such dividend aristocrats to boost your returns. Such stocks also possess a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The favorable Zacks Rank should help these stocks gain further this year as well.

In the year-ago period, Nokia had reported earnings of 0.15 (17 cents) per share.Net sales declined year over year (on a comparable combined company basis) to 6.7 billion (approximately $7.1 billion). Moreover, the top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.38 billion. The disappointing performance by the Nokia Networks division was due to the challenging market conditions. Moreover, weak sales in Mobile Networks, which is part of Ultra Broadband Networks, contributed to the significant decline.Quarterly adjusted gross margin was 42% in the reported quarter compared with 42.4% a year ago. Operating margin decreased 260 basis points (bps) to 14% on a year-over-year basis. In the fourth quarter, Nokia generated net cash from operating activities of 510 million as against 460 million at the end of 2015.Nokia is rapidly expanding in the field of technology and wireless infrastructure.

The segment includes Ultra Broadband Networks, and IP Networks and Applications. The decline in the Ultra Broadband Networks sub-group by 15% to 4,332 million hurt the segmental sales. The segment's sales also suffered due to a reduction of 12% to 1,976 million in net sales of the IP Networks and Application segment.Notably, net sales declined in all regions, apart from Middle East & Africa, which led to the segment's below-par performance. Net sales declined by 11% in North America,  30% in Latin America,  2% in the Asia Pacific, 33% in Greater China and  17% in Europe. Segmental gross margin improved 50 bps to 40.6% in the reported quarter.

3 Tech Stocks Paying Better Dividends Than Apple;February 02, 2017, 12:00:01 AM EDT;"Technology stocks, once the domain of high-flying growth investors, are becoming an increasingly generous source of dividends for income investors. The information technology sector led the market by total dividends paid both for the third quarter of 2016 and for the 12 months that ended September 30, according to a FactSet analysis of the 419 dividend payers in Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. Apple (symbolAAPL) was tops in the IT sector, paying $12.2 billion in dividends over the 12-month stretch.But just because Apple handed out the most money to its shareholders doesn't mean it's the best source of income in the sector. In fact, Apple's stock currently yields just 1.8%, even less than the S&P 500's 2.1%. So we set out to find mature tech stocks with solid business outlooks that offer superior yields to Apple. Our search turned up three blue-chip names. How blue? Like Apple, all three of our picks are components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Take a look.makeArticleAd();Cisco SystemsCisco Systems, which makes the routers, switches and modems that form the backbone of the internet, is poised for better-than-expected sales growth, analysts say. A recent survey of its customers by UBS Securities revealed that spending on Cisco products remains a top budgetary priority. The tech company gets good marks for being easy to work with, and two-thirds of respondents said it has the best overall security offering. The growth of cloud-based computing (storing data and applications on remote servers) and the Internet of Things (the expanding digital interconnectivity of everyday items, from cars to refrigerators) are long-term tailwinds for the company and the stock. UBS has a ""buy"" rating on Cisco shares.Analysts, on average, expect Cisco's earnings to rise by just a penny this fiscal year ending July 30, to $2.37 from $2.36, according to a survey by Thomson Reuters. Sales are forecast to slip 1.9% in fiscal 2017. The more bullish case for Cisco stems from projections for the following fiscal year (ending in July 2018), when profits are projected to climb 5% to $2.49 a share, and revenue is expected to gain 2.4%.Cisco's dividend, which dates back to 2011, has increased annually. The company disbursed $5 billion in common dividends for the 12 months ended Oct. 31. That was supported by $12 billion in free cash flow, or cash left over after spending the money required to operate and expand the business.SEE ALSO:10 Stocks Every Retiree Should OwnIntelConsumers are increasingly forgoing desktop computers for mobile devices. As a result, PC sales have become a slowly melting iceberg. Market research firm Gartner found that PC sales fell for eight consecutive quarters as of the third quarter of 2016. That has forced Intel, the world's largest maker of the central processing units that serve as a PC's brain, to find new ways to generate revenue growth.The expansion of cloud-based services has been a boon to Intel, thanks to its market-share dominance in server chips. True, Intel faces changes in customer demands and competition from rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), but analysts at Stifel say it's responding well. ""Intel has been acquiring technologies and recruiting outside managerial talent to prepare for the changing market,"" Stifel analyst Kevin Cassidy, who rates Intel shares a ""buy,"" said in a recent note to clients.Analysts expect 2017 earnings to rise to $2.79 from $2.72 a share in 2016, according to Thomson Reuters. Revenue is forecast to increase 1% to $60.1 billion. Intel paid its first cash dividend in 1992, and the company resumed annual dividend hikes two years ago. Intel's payout ratio, or dividends as a percentage of earnings, is a conservative 37% and below even the S&P 500's average ratio of 40%.SEE ALSO:3 Reasons to Own Apple Stock in RetirementMicrosoftMicrosoft is another tech company that's benefiting from the rise in cloud computing. An increasing number of customers now pay a recurring subscription fee to use its software rather than purchasing it outright. It's proving to be a hot area of growth. ""The closely watched commercial cloud business -- which includes Office 365, Azure and Dynamics 365 -- continued to grow at a torrid rate, reaching over $14.0 billion in annualized revenue in the second quarter [which ended December 31, 2016],"" William Blair & Co. analyst Jason Ader said in a recent note to clients.Importantly, the analyst expects Microsoft to become more profitable over time because of its ""disproportionate growth in its commercial cloud business, which is being boosted by rapid customer adoption of Office 365 and Azure."" Azure is Microsoft's cloud-computing platform, and Office 365 is the subscription version of its popular Office applications. Cloud-based services can have higher profit margins than traditional licensed software.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters project earnings to rise to $2.97 a share for the current fiscal year ending June 30, from $2.79 in fiscal 2016. Revenue for fiscal 2017 is expected to increase 4.9% year over year, to $96.5 billion. For its second quarter, which ended December 31, Microsoft generated $1.3 billion in free cash flow after disbursing $3 billion worth of dividends. The company has paid a dividend to its shareholders since 2003. By contrast, Apple resumed paying a regular quarterly dividend only in 2012, following a 17-year layoff.SEE ALSO:10 Best Dividend-Paying Stocks for 2017"

Is Apple (AAPL) A Double From Here?;February 01, 2017, 05:37:13 PM EDT;"I talked yesterday about the Fed.  As I said, I think we'll find that the Fed will shift gears again to stay behind the curve on inflation, to let the economy run a little hot.  They met today and it was a non-event. They said nothing to build momentum on their rate hike from December.The news of the day has been Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) earnings.  People over the past couple of years have been calling for the decline in Apple.  They've said it's topped.  They can't innovate in the post-Steve Jobs era.  The iPhone was magic. But reproducing magic isnt easy.  Once you put a computer in everyone's pocket, there's not much more they can do to it with it. These are all of the quips about Apple's peak.  They may be right.  But Apple's peak, at least as a stock, is greatly exaggerated.They reported a huge positive surprise on earnings yesterday after the close.  The stock was up 6% on the day.  But even before that, I suspect it has become a much loved stock in the past two months in the ""smart money"" investor community.We should see in the coming weeks, as big investors disclose their positioning for the end of Q4, Apple will have returned to a lot of portfolios again.  Warren Buffett, an investor that has made his fortune buying when others are selling, built a big stake at the lows of the year last year.  And it's a perfect Buffett stock.Its incredibly cheap compared to the market.The stock still trades at 15x earnings.  Much cheaper than the market.  Apple trades at 13x next years projected earnings.  The S&P 500 trades at 16.5x.  What about Apple's monster cash position?  Apple has even more cash now -- a record $246 billion. If we excluded the cash from the valuation, Apple market cap goes down from $675 billion to $429 billion.  That would equate to Apple trading at closer to 9x earnings. Though not an apples to apples that valuation would group Apple with the likes of these S&P 500 components that trade around 9 times earnings, like:  Dow Chemical, Prudential Financial, Bed Bath & Beyond, a Norwegian chemical company (LBY), and Hewlett Packard Enterprise. It's safe to say no one is debating whether or not Hewlett Packard is at the pinnacle of its business. Yet, if we strip out the cash in Apple, AAPL shares are trading closer to an HPE valuation.Add to that, Apple now has afresh catalystcoming in, Trump policies. The new President Trump is incentivizing Apple (and others) tobring offshore cash hoards back homewith a flat 10% tax.  And Apple makes money  a lot of it.  Acut in the corporate tax ratewill be a boon for earnings.  Two years ago, Carl Icahn argued that Apple should use (a lot more of) their cash to buyback shares  and, with that, valued the stock at double its current levels.makeArticleAd();For help building a high potential portfolio for 2017, follow me in ourBillionaires Portfolio, where you look over my shoulder as I follow the worlds best investors into their best stocks.

Apple, Inc. Earnings: 3 Answers From CEO Tim Cook;February 01, 2017, 05:06:00 PM EDT;"Ahead ofApple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) first-quarter earnings report on Tuesday,   investors were primarily looking for the company to show that it   can reverse its recent declining iPhone business. And Apple didexactly this, reporting 5% year-over-year growth in both iPhone unit and   revenue growth, helping the company's total revenue increase 3%   year over year. Even better, the company said it expected more   growth in its second quarter.But beyond Apple's financial performance, investors likely had   other questions on their minds -- questions more suitable for   management's earning call following the release. To this end, I   laid outthree questions Apple management would hopefully   addressduring the call. As it turns out, Apple management addressed all   three of these important topics.Apple CEO Tim Cook. Image source: Apple.makeArticleAd();Here's how Apple CEO Tim Cook and his management team answered   these three questions on Tuesday:1. How confident is management in its product pipeline?While the iPhone did return to growth in Apple's first   quarter, it was still relatively slow growth. The iPhone's   headwinds have put the pressure on the company to develop new   products to help accelerate growth. While investors obviously   shouldn't have expected Apple to spill the beans on anything   specific on Tuesday, Tim Cook did express confidence in the   company's pipeline of upcoming products.In Apple's first-quarter earnings press release, Cook said   Apple is ""very excited"" about the products in its pipeline. And   during Apple's earnings call, Cook showed even more enthusiasm,   saying, ""we've got some exciting things in the pipeline; I feel   really, really good about it.""2. What could Apple's services revenue growth look like going   forward?Services continue to grow in importance to Apple, and the   company's first quarter was no exception. Services revenue   climbed 18% year over year, growing to about 9% of total sales,   up from about 8% last year. And even this growth understates how   sharply the segment is climbing, as the company's services   segment benefited from a one-off $548 million patent-infringement   payment in the year-ago quarter.App Store sales are helping fuel services growth. Image     source: Apple.Going forward, Cook said (here's aReuters transcriptof the earnings call) that he expects services to become even   more integral to Apple's business:Services are becoming a larger part of our business, and we     expect the revenues to be the size of a Fortune 100 company     this year. Our services offerings are now driving over 150     million paid customer subscriptions. This includes our own     services, and third-party content that we offer on our stores.     We feel great about this momentum, and our goal is to double     the size of our services business in the next four years.These expectations for Apple's services segment translate to a   forecast of about 20% annualized growth over the next four   years.3. If there's a tax break for repatriation, does Apple plan   to take advantage of it?With President Donald Trump saying he plans to offer a one-off   tax holiday for U.S. companies to repatriate their overseas funds   at a lower tax rate, investors have good reason to be interested   in what Apple's CEO thinks of this. After all, of Apple's $246.1   billion in cash and marketable securities, an incredible $230.2   billion is outside of the United States.Fortunately, Cook talked about this potential holiday,   signaling he expected Apple to take full advantage:I am optimistic given what I'm hearing, that there would     likely be some sort of tax reform this year, and it does seem     like there's people in both parties that would favor a     repatriation as a part of that. So I think that's very good for     the country and good for Apple.But Cook said investors will have to wait to see how   repatriated funds would be allocated:What we would do with it -- let's wait and see exactly what     it is -- but as I've said before, we are always looking at     acquisitions. We acquired 15 to 20 companies per year for the     last four years, and we look for companies of all sizes, and     there's not a size that we would not do based on just the size     of it. It's more about the strategic value of it.Beyond acquisitions, Apple could obviously allocate funds   toward other capital investments in its own business, a dividend   increase, a special dividend, share repurchases, or even all of   the above.While these were some of the more important topics covered   during the call, management also covered more details on the   company's services business, its regional results, the smartphone   market, and more.

What Happened in the Stock Market Today;February 01, 2017, 04:56:00 PM EDT;"Image source: Getty Images.Stocks barely budged on Wednesday despite an interest rate   announcement by the Federal Reserve and a flood of fresh earnings   reports. Through all of that, theDow Jones Industrial Average(DJINDICES: ^DJI) and theS&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) indexes each finished only marginally   higher.makeArticleAd();Today's stock market:IndexPercentage ChangePoint ChangeDow0.14%26.85S&P 5000.03%0.68Data source: Yahoo! Finance.Financial stocks and gold stocks saw elevated investor   attention on a day when the Federal Reserve decided to keep   long-term interest rates unchanged. Neither group broke far away   from broader market averages, though, and both theFinancial Sector SPDR Select ETF(NYSEMKT: XLF) and the leveragedDirexion Daily Gold Miners Bull 3X ETF(NYSEMKT: NUGT) were essentially unchanged.On the other hand, earnings season produced large price swings   in a few individual stocks, includingApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) andPitney Bowes(NYSE: PBI) .Apple returns to growthApple shares soared 7% to lead the Dow higher after the   company demonstrated that its growth days arefar from over. Revenue rose 3% following three consecutive quarters of   declines on strong demand for its latest iPhone models. Average   selling pricesjumpedthanks to a clear preference on the part of consumers for the   larger iPhone 7 Plus, and that success helped the company trounce   its earnings guidance.The tech titan generated $3.36 per share of profit compared to   expectations of $3.17 per share. ""We're thrilled to report that   our holiday quarter results generated Apple's highest quarterly   revenue ever, and broke multiple records along the way,"" CEO Tim   Cook said in a press release.iPhone 7 Plus. Image source: Apple.Cook and his team drew attention to the company's booming   services business that includes iTunes and App Store purchases.   The segment passed $25 billion of revenue over the prior 12   months and is now responsible for nearly 10% of overall sales.   This quarter's gain was just below 20%, which suggests Apple has   a good shot at doubling services revenue by fiscal 2020.In the meantime, the company guided toward another quarter of   iPhone-led growth ahead, as revenue should come in at $52.5   billion while gross profit margin holds steady at just below 40%   of sales.Pitney Bowes misses expectationsPitney Bowes slumped 18% followingsurprisingly weak quarterly results. The office services specialist reported a 5% sales decline as   it produced adjusted earnings of $0.53 per share. Both the top-   and bottom-line figures were significantly lower than Wall Street   and management had forecast.""Our fourth quarter and full-year results were not what we   wanted or expected,"" CEO Marc Lautenbach said in a press release.   Executives were especially disappointed with their performance in   the software solutions business, which saw a 7% sales decline and   a 16% drop in operating earnings. The miss helped push revenue   down by 4% for the full year so that Pitney Bowes came in below   the lowered outlook it announced in early November.Looking ahead, management believes it has put most of the   sales disruptions, and a good portion of its restructuring   charges, behind it. However, Lautenbach and his team sounded a   similar tone three months ago when they pulled back their 2016   outlook after anespecially weak third quarter. Investors aren't keen to give the company much slack after two   consecutive outings headlined by disappointing operating results,   so the stock took a justifiable beating on Wednesday.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Silicon Laboratories Delivers Another Quarterly Beat;February 01, 2017, 04:40:00 PM EDT;"Silicon Laboratories(NASDAQ: SLAB) released stronger-than-expected fourth-quarter   2016 results Wednesday morning, driven by sustained momentum from   its Internet of Things segment.

He elaborated: ""We are   executing on our strategy focused on the IoT and Infrastructure   markets and are seeing our efforts translate into strong   financial results, achieving target model for annual growth,   gross margin, and operating margin in the second half.""Looking forwardFor the first quarter of 2017, Silicon Labs anticipates   revenue of $174 million to $179 million, the midpoint of which   represents 8.9% year-over-year growth. On the bottom line,   Silicon Labs expects that performance to translate to adjusted   earnings per diluted share of between $0.57 and $0.63, up from   $0.51 per share in last year's first quarter. For   perspective -- and though we don't usually pay close attention to   Wall Street's quarterly demands -- analysts were less optimistic,   with consensus estimates calling fiscal first-quarter revenue and   earnings near the low ends of Silicon Labs' guidance ranges.Once again, Silicon Laboratories' relative outperformance was   evident this quarter, as it continues to capitalize on the   increasing ubiquity of connected devices. And even with shares   trading at all-time highs going into this report, it's no   surprise investors were willing to continue bidding up Silicon   Labs stock today.10 stocks we like better than Silicon   LaboratoriesWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Apple's Earnings Shine As iPhone 7 Cycle Turns Out Better Than Expected;February 01, 2017, 04:30:58 PM EDT;"Apple (AAPL) posted a record set of first quarter earnings on Tuesday, beating market expectations on both revenues and earnings, amid a strong uptake for its iPhone 7 smartphones, higher Mac sales and a fast growing services business. Below, we provide some of the key takeaways from Apple's earnings release.We have a$127 price estimate for Apple,which is slightly ahead of the current market price.See Our Complete Analysis For Apple HeremakeArticleAd();iPhone Has A Solid Quarter Amid Shipment And   ASP GrowthShipments of the iPhone touched record highs, growing by 5% year-over-year to about 78.3 million units, driven by strong demand for the iPhone 7 and carrier promotions in the United States. Sales growth could have been higher (~8%) on a sell-through basis, as Apple reduced channel inventory over the quarter. iPhone ASPs came in at a record high of $695 per unit, as the demand mix for the larger 7 Plus was higher compared to previous iterations. Moreover, the increasing shift towards mechanisms such as equipment installment plans and leases, where buyers do not pay anything upfront for their devices, are also helping to skew the demand mix towards higher-tier models. Apple's total revenue guidance for Q2 FY'17 stands at $51.5 billion and $53.5 billion (4% year-over-year at the mid-point). This is relatively strong, considering that the iPhone 7 is largely viewed as a bridge device, with Apple prepping to unveil a completely overhauled 10th anniversary iPhone this fall.Greater China Sees An Improvement On Constant Currency   BasisApple's gross margins came in at 38.5% for the quarter. While this was at the high end of the company's guidance range, it was roughly 150 bps lower than last year's figure. There are likely to be two key factors driving this reduction. Firstly, the strong dollar is hurting Apple's price realizations in many key emerging markets. Moreover, there is a possibility that manufacturing costs on the new iPhones are higher, on account of the more advanced components and higher memory capacity per devices. (Related:Apple's Flagship iPhone Keeps Getting More Expensive To Build) However, this is likely to have been partially offset by a higher mix of service revenues (9.1% of total sales, up from 8% last year), which have significantly higher gross margins. Apple is projecting gross margins of between 38% and 39% for Q2 FY'17.Greater China Sees An Improvement On Constant Currency   BasisApple's performance in Greater China saw some improvement, driven by a strong uptake for the iPhone 7, which emerged the best selling smartphone in the country during the holiday quarter, as well as double digit growth in iPad shipments. Revenues from the region came in at $16.23 billion, marking a 12% year-over-year decline, amid depreciation of the Chinese Yuan (down 6% year-over-year) as well as a significant decline in sales from Hong Kong.  However, the company says that sales from Mainland China would have actually been up by about 6% on a constant current basis, marking a significant improvement over the firm's performance in the recent quarters.Services Growth Remains Strong, Watch Could Be Gaining   MomentumServices revenues rose by roughly 18% year-over-year to an all time record of $7.17 billion, driven primarily by the App Store, which saw revenues grow by 43% over the quarter and the Apple Music streaming music service. This is positive, considering that the rate of growth in Apple's iDevice installed base is likely to be slowing down, potentially indicating that per-device spending on services is trending upwards. Apple indicated that it was looking to double its services revenues over the next four years. Apple also noted that the Apple Watch had its best quarter ever both in terms of units and revenues, with demand outstripping supply.View Interactive Institutional Research (Powered by Trefis):Global Large Cap|U.S. Mid & Small Cap|European Large & Mid CapMore Trefis   Research"

Why InvenSense Fell 11% Today;February 01, 2017, 04:24:00 PM EDT;"What happenedShares ofInvenSense(NYSE: INVN) took a sudden dive on Wednesday, plunging as much as   11.4% with little warning.So whatUnconfirmed chatter that InvenSense might lose a component   supply contract withApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) cast a shadow over the company's pending merger   with Japanese electronics veteranTDK(NASDAQOTH: TTDKY) . Apple accounted for 40% of InvenSense's   revenue in fiscal 2016, so any weakening of that crucial business   relationship would clearly undermine InvenSense's value to TDK as   well.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();Now whatTDK wants to establish itself as a major supplier of sensor   solutions, and picking up InvenSense for $1.3 billion in cash   would go a long way toward that goal. It's unclear how the rumors   of a fallout between Apple and InvenSense got started, and the   whispers could very well turn out to be mere hearsay and   gossip.I see no reason for InvenSense investors to take this report   too seriously, because the pending merger provides a comfortable   buffer for any newfound risks. If nothing else, having TDK back   out would probably trigger a $46.7 million termination fee,   addressed straight to InvenSense. TDK owners, on the other hand,   may want to keep an eye on the InvenSense/Apple connection.10 stocks we like better than InvenSenseWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Are Your Favorite Stocks Cheap?;February 01, 2017, 04:07:00 PM EDT;"(1:30) - Under Armour misses earnings first time in 5 years!(3:15) - Is Starbucks out of favor with investors? Tracey talks   restaurants.(5:48) - Apple and William & Sonoma: Are they value stocks?(10:40) - Stock ticker summaryWelcome to Episode #28 of the Value Investor PodcastEvery week, Zacks value stock strategist and the Editor ofZacks Value Investor portfolio, Tracey Ryniec, talks about all things happening in the value stock universe, including her top stock picks.It's earnings season so that means some stocks will get a boost off their reports, and others will get sold off. These days, an earnings miss or a warning on guidance can be enough to send a stock down by the double digits.If you're a value investor, your first thought upon seeing a big sell off in a stock is probably ""is that stock cheap enough for me to buy now?""There have been some juicy sell offs already this earnings season. Additionally, some other ""favorite"" stocks that many people own seem out of favor or down on their luck.Are These Favorite Stocks Cheap Enough to Be   Values?1.      Under Armour (UAA) sold off 25% on its first earnings miss in 5 years. Shares are now down over 50% from their highs. But is it a value?2.     Starbucks (SBUX) went nowhere after its earnings reports. Shares also fell 9% in the last year, underperforming the market. The company appears to be out-of-favor with investors. (In full disclosure, Tracey is a long-term owner of it in her personal portfolio.) Should value investors be taking a look?3.     Shake Shack Inc. (SHAK) was once the darling of Wall Street but shares have fallen 19% over the last 2 years. Is the growth catching up with the valuation now?4.     Apple (AAPL) just reported earnings. Revenues surprised the Street. Is it one of the few technology stocks that might be a value stock?5.     Williams-Sonoma Inc. (WSM) owns one of the top brands in home furnishings: West Elm. But it's other brands are struggling.

Apple Inc.'s iPhone 7 Plus Is a Smash Hit;February 01, 2017, 01:19:00 PM EDT;"The first quarter of anApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) fiscal year is usually the company's peak quarter,   as it follows the launch of Apple's latest flagship iPhone   device. The iPhone generates the bulk of the company's revenue,   and so the quarter in which Apple sees the most iPhone shipments   is the quarter in which it sees its greatest revenue.Apple's iPhone 7 Plus. Image source: Apple.makeArticleAd();Although there were rumors that Apple was seeing relatively   tepid demand for its latest iPhone models -- the iPhone 7 and the   iPhone 7 Plus -- the company's financial performance tells a   different tale.Apple reported shipping a record 78.29 million iPhones in the   first quarter, handily beating its previous quarterly record of   just shy of 75 million units. CEO Tim Cook said that it saw   ""exceptional demand"" for iPhones that ""beat [Apple's] own   internal expectations.""This robust unit demand didn't come at the expense of average   selling prices, either -- iPhone average selling prices in the   quarter came in at just a hair under $695.Just as the iPhone business is the star of the company's most   recent earnings report, the iPhone 7 Plus appears to be the star   of the iPhone business.iPhone 7 Plus is a smash hitCook said that the iPhone 7 is the company's ""most popular   model,"" but he highlighted the fact that the company saw   ""especially strong demand for iPhone 7 Plus.""Demand was so strong, in fact, that Cook says that the iPhone   7 Plus made up ""a higher portion of the new product mix than   [Apple has] ever seen with Plus models in the past.""To further drive the point home, even given the   stronger-than-expected unit shipment performance during the   quarter, Apple reported that ""demand for iPhone 7 Plus exceeded   supply throughout the quarter"" and that the company only ""came   into supply/demand balance in January.""And, finally, it's worth pointing out that Apple is seeing   this unexpectedly strong iPhone 7 Plus demand even though it   priced the devices at a $20 premium to where it had priced   previous iPhone Plus models (which previously carried $100   premiums over their non-Plus counterparts).Clearly, Apple's customer base likes what the company did with   the iPhone 7 Plus and was willing to pay a premium for the added   features.In the past, Apple had differentiated its Plus models with   larger, sharper displays as well as some very minor camera   enhancements (i.e., optical image stabilization). However, this   time around, in addition to the usual points of differentiation,   Apple included a dual-lens camera on the iPhone 7 Plus which   enabled an interesting optical zoom feature.The key lesson here is that if Apple brings interesting   innovations and features to premium products and tries to charge   a premium for those features, then it may very well get paid for   those features.Open sesameAt this point, it's obvious what Apple should do next --   introduce even higher-priced iPhones with even more interesting   features and points of differentiation. Apple shouldn't go wild   adding in every feature under the sun, but its product definition   and marketing teams should now have the freedom to go ahead and   build products with higher cost structures that are intended to   sell at higher price points.Such products, launched in conjunction with models priced at   the more ""typical"" price points, could be quite successful for   the company. In fact, current rumors suggest that Apple is   planning to launch two straightforward successors to this year's   iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, and then higher up in the product   stack, the company may launch an iPhone with a curved OLED   display and other goodies.If the upcoming OLED iPhone is a fundamentally compelling   product -- and I think it will be -- then I could see Apple   successfully charging even more for it than it does for its top   iPhone 7 Plus models.The next couple of years could be very interesting for Apple's   iPhone product line and, ultimately, its business!10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

With gains of 400% over the past year, AMD stock haspunished those who bet against it. But is it now time to take profits?makeArticleAd();Source:Matthew Rutledge via FlickrNope.AMD stock had a slow start to 2017, off about 6% before Tuesday night's fourth-quarter earnings report, is back in the black thanks to a Wednesday surge after showing off some of the operational dominance it sported in a rip-roaring 2016.Expectation for the QuarterFor the quarter that ended December, Wall Street expected the company to report a loss of 2 cents per share on revenues of $1.07 billion. AMD beat on both fronts, recording revenues of $1.11 billion and a loss of just 1 cent per share.Recent results fromIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) hinted that Advanced Micro might be in for a Street-beating quarter.7 Stocks to Buy That Could Double by 2018On Friday John Vinh, analyst at Pacific Crest noted that Intel's results, which reflected less-bad personal computer trends, suggests strong growth for the sector. Notably, Vinh cited AMD as benefiting from ""strength in gaming and high-end PCs."" To that end, the analysts also said the improvements in high-end PCs could reduce concerns about high-end GPU inventory at desktop graphics card manufacturers.Well, a beat is what we got, and that came on the power of AMD's graphics chips, which saw revenues grow 15% year-over-year.The Key to AMD: GPUsGPU, or Graphics Processing Unit, is a big business for AMD. Those chips render images, animations and video for display on computer's screens. And the strength of that business has been a key component of AMD's turnaround. In the third quarter, reported in October, AMD posted a 23% year-over-year jump in revenue of $1.3 billion. The company benefited from strong growth in its popular Radeon line GPUs as revenue from that segment rose 11% year over year.This quarter, GPUs helped once more. Revenues in Computing and Graphics grew 28% year-over-year, thanks in part to higher average GPU selling prices.The company recently announced that its FirePro server GPUs have been selected byAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL) to power its cloud platform in 2017. All told, AMD's GPU strength has begun to gain traction in different verticals, which should help it narrow the market share gap with leaderNvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA).Bottom Line for AMD StockAMD's report was full of other positives, such as an expansion of gross margins from 30% to 32%, and slight gains in its Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom business (4%).Still, graphics and high performance are the name of the game.AMD stock surged 14% higher on Wednesday's reaction to fourth-quarter results, putting shares at highs last seen in 2017. The stock has returned more than 400% in 12 months - better than the 20% one-year gain in theS&P 500.And even still, AMD is showing that there's little let-up in the growth ramp.I expect AMD stock to reach $13 in 2017, delivering 22% gains on the back of greater GPU adoption and rising margins.As of this writing, Richard Saintvilus did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceWill the Apple Inc.

Apple, Inc. Earnings: Why Shares Are Trading Higher;February 01, 2017, 12:33:00 PM EDT;"Following the company's first-quarter earnings report on   Tuesday, shares ofApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) are up sharply on Wednesday. At the time of this   writing,Apple stockis trading at about $123, up more than 5% for the trading day.   The move helped the stock hit a new 52-week high. Apple stock's   move higher on Monday adds to the increasingly bullish sentiment   toward the stock recently. In the past six months, shares are up   about 23%, easily outperforming the S&P 500's 5% gain during   the same period.Investor optimism toward Apple stock recently is likely due to   a wide range of factors, including its conservative valuation,   speculation about a major redesign for Apple's expected iPhone   launch this fall, and Samsung's recall of its Galaxy Note 7. But   one trend in Apple's business is likely serving as a primary   driver for the company's rising stock price: a rebound in iPhone   sales.iPhone 7. Image source: Apple.makeArticleAd();Rebounding iPhone salesTo understand why recently rebounding iPhone sales are so   important to investors, it's important to realize how steeply   iPhone sales were declining on a year-over-year basis just a few   quarters ago.MetricQ3 2016Q2 2016iPhone unit sales growth (YOY)(15%)(16%)iPhone revenue growth (YOY)(23%)(18%)Total revenue (YOY)(15%)(13%)Fiscal quarters shown. Data retrieved from Apple's earnings   releases. Table by author.At the iPhone segment's worst point last year, unit sales and   revenue in the company's fiscal third quarter of 2016 declined   15% and 23%, respectively, dragging total revenue 15% lower   compared to the year-ago quarter. As Apple was reporting   significant year-over-year declines in its largest product   segment, investors were concerned about how the product segment   would perform over the longer term.But as early as Apple's fourth-quarter earnings report in   October, it was clear that the tech giant's iPhone business could   soon end a three-quarter streak of year-over-year declines in   total revenue. The company guided for first-quarter revenue to be   between $76 billion and $78 billion, up from $75.9 billion in the   year-ago quarter. Considering that iPhone accounts for over 60%   of Apple's trailing-12-month revenue, this meant management was   optimistic about the company's new September-launched iPhone 7   and 7 Plus.Sure enough, iPhone sales rebounded.Fiscal quarters shown. Data retrieved from Apple's earnings     releases. Chart by author.Apple's first-quarter earnings release this week confirmed the   company's return to iPhone growth, with Apple reporting   year-over-year iPhone unit and revenue growth of 5%, helping the   company's total revenue rise 3%.Can iPhone growth persist?The big question going forward, of course, is whether Apple's   iPhone business can keep growing. In the near term, it looks like   management expects another quarter of growth. Apple said it   expected total second-quarter revenue to be between $51.5 billion   and $53.5 billion, up from $50.6 billion in the year-ago quarter.   With iPhone accounting for the bulk of Apple's total revenue,   this guidance for growth in total revenue likely means management   expects growth for the iPhone, too.Beyond Apple's second quarter, however, it's not as certain   that Apple's iPhone sales growth can be sustained throughout   fiscal 2017. However, a return to growth for iPhone 7 -- a   product with a three-year-old form factor -- is promising news,   highlighting how well the company's products continue to resonate   with customers.Combining Apple stock's conservative valuation with growth in   the company's biggest product segment, it's easy to see why   investors are optimistic about the stock's potential,   recently.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Facebook Inc (FB) TV App Is More Trouble Than You Think;February 01, 2017, 12:12:48 PM EDT;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) opened for trade Feb. 1 at an all-time high - a market cap of $365 billion - on the strength of its dominance in mobile apps. But the big news is that Facebook is about to challenge the video league leaders with a mobile app for existing streaming boxes like theApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) TV. The question is, what will this do for FB stock?makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockMoving into TV through an app rather than a device makes sense, given the failure of the original Facebook phone and its overwhelming success with apps for others' phones.FB is already bankrolling the creation of videos for the video tab of itsmobile app.So where does Facebook fit its service into the evolving market, and what does its presence as a broadcaster mean to its claims not to be a media company?FB Stock: TV vs. PhoneThe company is already a presence in video thanks toFacebook Live, which allows live streaming of video on the service and it has aPresidential endorsement.10 Stocks to Buy That Already Make America GreatFB has prepared to offer longer videos by introducing ""mid-roll"" ads - ads that play in the middle of a video - to its line-up, making the service more TV-like.Over time, this might allow Facebook to compete directly withAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN),Netflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX) andAlphabet Inc's(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) YouTube in the growing market for streaming services.The problem is that there is a big difference between the experience you get on a mobile phone and what you want on a TV screen. A phone is active, a TV is passive. A phone may support videos of a few minutes, while people will watch TV for hours-and-hours.There is an assumption in the breathless reporting of Facebook's latest move that TV is easy; that it's just something you throw money at. Given the success of Netflix in generating subscribers and Emmys, and Amazon in generating Prime members and Oscar buzz, that is an easy mistake to make.Worth the Candle?For Facebook stock, this may not be as huge a deal as analysts think.Netflix revenue is only a fraction of FB stock's. Analysts expect Facebook to deliver over $27 billion in 2016 revenue when it reports after the market closes Feb. 1. This is against roughly $9 billion for Netflix. NFLX also brings just 3% of that revenue to the bottom line, while FB stock brings nearly one-third of revenue to its net income line.Entering the world of creating television poses another risk. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has repeatedly saidhe doesn't run a media company, that his is just a communications service. Media companies have responsibilities to truth and accuracy that, say, phone companies don't have - responsibilitiesthat can limit profitability.If Facebook is going to license content from media suppliers, whether live or scripted, it becomes a media company, subject to political and public scrutiny for its programming choices, on a global basis. This is a dance FB stock shareholders should fear, because it costs money to play, and carries risk.Can Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Jump Over These Hurdles?But Facebook may now have no choice in the matter. The big screen is the last frontier for internet services, it's where everyone is heading. FB stock does not want to be left behind.The Bottom Line on Facebook StockWhile most analysts are jumping for joy over the Facebook TV app news, I am a lot more cautious. This move has enormous implications for the entire company, for how it's perceived and (more important) what it costs to run.FB, like Alphabet, prefers to manage itself through algorithms. Algorithms scale in ways people do not. Facebook is starting to bow to pressure on the media front,hiring Campbell Brownto coordinate media alliances. Now it's about to become a TV network, or at least a streaming service.What will that mean to its profitability and growth? I think they both slow, because people aren't algorithms and talent has temper that code does not have. Politics can kill the media star.Dana Blankenhornis a financial and technology journalist.

Will the Apple Inc. HomeKit Beat Amazons Alexa? (AAPL);February 01, 2017, 12:12:09 PM EDT;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) announced HomeKit - its strategy for becoming the center of the smart home - in June 2014.Amazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) revealed its Alexa-powered Echo smart speaker that November.makeArticleAd();Source: Apple/AmazonWhile there are currently several dozen HomeKit compatible smart home products, Amazon's Alexa is now connected to thousands of smart products and services and has spread from the Echo to third-party devices.On the surface, it looks as though Amazon has outmaneuvered and thoroughly trounced Apple. But despite the seemingly insurmountable lead and momentum, AAPL could still end up beating AMZN in this smart home race.Here's how.Apple Chose the Closed Approach With HomeKitApple tends to be extremely cautious. Its software is designed to be user-friendly and secure. iPhone apps can't just be downloaded from anywhere; they need to go through the official App Store and that requires approval by AAPL. Third-party hardware needs to be certified by Apple before it can be marketed as being iOS-compatible.It's that ""walled"" approach that hasmade the iPhone more securethan smartphones runningAlphabet Inc's(NASDAQ:GOOGL) Android operating system.With the iPhone and Siri - Apple's voice assistant - at the center of Apple's smart home strategy, that focus on security, compatibility and ease of use carried over toHomeKit. Manufacturers who want to make their smart devices HomeKit-compatible face a daunting series of requirements.Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Has a New Hero: Services!As pointed out in a recent Reuters article ondiffering smart home approaches, this includes being forced to buy a special HomeKit chip, being limited to approved (and more expensive than average) Bluetooth and Wi-Fi chips and even extends to manufacturing being limited to factories that are certified by Apple. End-to-end encryption is mandatory. Once a HomeKit product is ready, it faces extensive testing by Apple engineers to ensure compatibility.Thenit may be sold. That process alone can take three to five months.So you have additional costs, the procedural red tape and a delay. It's easy to understand whyApple currently lists only 75 or so HomeKit-compatible devices. And half of those are either different color options or regional variations of the same product.Amazon Alexa Is Open for BusinessAmazon took a radically different approach with its Echo speaker and Alexa. The company openly courted third-party companies to develop Alexa ""skills"" or software-enabled interactions with an Amazon Alexa-powered device.A skill can be the ability to tell Alexa to order anUber. It could also be telling Alexa to turn on your home's smart lights or to start your electric car. The process is simple. Amazon provides an example showinghow to build an Alexa skill in 60 minutes, and that includes the time needed to create a developer account. Submit the skill to AMZN for a quick verification, and it's published.That's how Amazon Alexa tripled its available skills in just three months last year, hitting 3,000 in September. If that sounds impressive, by CES 2017 in January, it had hit more than 7,000 Alexa skills.In addition to skills, Amazon also encourages third parties to integrate Alexa functionality into their products. That way, consumers get the Alexa experience without requiring an Echo speaker.That's a far easier process than Apple HomeKit certification. A ""Works with Alexa"" label takes about 10 days to obtain (it can even be issued by third party labs) and doesn't require special chips. According to the Reuters post, that has resulted in over 250 products that are Alexa-certified. We saw some of these at CES, including third-party speakers with Alexa and even home appliances with built-in Alexa capability.Smart Home Security: Apple Strength, Amazon Alexa VulnerabilityThe differing approaches of AMZN and AAPL have led to Alexa rapidly leaping to a massive lead over HomeKit in the smart home. However, there is one scenario where this could change rapidly.Security is increasingly becoming an issue for smart, connected devices. Apple's HomeKit approach emphasizes security, to the point of forcing the use of specialized chips and even certified manufacturing facilities.Amazon's Alexa strategy, on the other hand, leaves its platform relatively exposed. Amazon told Reuters it can't guarantee the security of third-party devices running Alexa. Those thousands of Alexa skills also integrate with third-party services that may have their own vulnerabilities.Trade of the Day: Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock No Longer a Home RunAll it would take is one catastrophic hacking for a PR disaster that turns consumers off Alexa. As CNET puts it in a review of thehacking risks for different smart home standards: ""Don't assume that a device has high security standards just because it works with Alexa.""Bottom LineThere's no disputing the fact that Amazon completely caught Apple and others off guard with its stealthy approach of sneaking Alexa into the home using its Echo connected speaker.Before the Echo, it was generally assumed that a smartphone would be the natural smart home controller. Making Alexa integration so open has also paid off for AMZN, resulting in a formidable lead in the smart home in a very short time. That lead may well turn into complete domination of the connected home. But Amazon's open approach may also prove to be its Achilles heel.Should hackers turn their attention to Amazon Alexa, the resulting headlines may flip the equation and put the much more secure Apple HomeKit on top in the long run.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceApple Inc.

Nokia Corp (ADR) (NOK) Stock Is Still Hobbling;February 01, 2017, 11:19:41 AM EDT;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsNokia Corp (ADR)(NYSE:NOK) is quintessentially Finnish - beautiful, rugged, quirky and a bit tragic. Once considered the preeminent mobile phone platform, its reign was challenged briefly byBlackBerry Ltd(NASDAQ:BBRY), then permanently byApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). Today, NOK stock is more than just a phone company, but will Wall Street care?makeArticleAd();Source:Open Grid Scheduler / Grid Engine via Flickr (Modified)Its fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 earnings report is set for release before the opening bell on Feb. 2.Would-be buyers and traders have a tough call to make. We all love stories of the great comeback, and Nokia stock is a candidate. Shedding its legacy image as a boxy-cell-phone manufacturer, NOK stock has been extremely acquisitive.We're not just talking about the buyout ofAlcatel-Lucent, although that is a big part of the story. It's also the procurement of lesser known assets that will assert Nokia's new role as apublic networksprovider.At the same time, we're talking about NOK stock here. Recently,InvestorPlacecontributor Will Ashworth slammed Nokia stock as still being ""a dog with fleas,"" borrowing a line from the iconic movieWall Street.It's a fitting description of a company which has ""delivered a scintillating annualtotal returnover the past 15 years of -7.14%, more than 11 percentage points worse than theS&P 500.""7 Stocks to Buy That Could Double by 2018Whatever management has up their sleeves, they better get to it. The markets are many things, but patient usually isn't one of them.The Nitty Gritty of Nokia EarningsLet's take a deeper look at the Nokia earnings. The average consensus estimate for earnings per share is 8 cents - smack in the middle of the forecast spectrum. For the top line, analysts are predicting sales to come in a range of $6.8 billion at the low to $7.6 billion at the high, with a $7.2 billion consensus.To say that the Nokia earnings environment is challenged is putting it mildly. First off, recent performances by NOK stock leave a lot to be desired. Fiscal 2016 is mostly a disappointment, with two misses and a narrow beat.Unless Nokia is planning to pull the proverbial rabbit out of the hat, I'm not sure what they can do. The financials for Nokia stock aren't exactly inspiring.Not surprisingly, Zacks Equity Research prospects for Nokia earnings are dim. Their analysts rank NOK stock as a ""sell,"" citing a litany of problems. Chief among them is the patent war that Nokia finds itself embroiled in with Apple. After losing the mobile phone business to Cupertino, NOK has devolved into whatInvestorPlacecontributor Dana Blankenhorn calls a""patent troll.""That's all fun and games when you pester from your home turf. But Nokia seemed to forget the first rule of trolling: don't troll those that can beat the crap out of you. Mighty Apple has had enough, and they're going to leverage their 22:1valuation disparityagainst Nokia.Again, as Blankenhorn states, that forces NOK stock into a weak hand.NOK Stock Is Wickedly UnpredictableClick to EnlargeStepping aside from the granularity of Nokia earnings, trading the shares based on its financial reports has a dubious history. Since Q4 of fiscal 2013, the average performance of Nokia stock quarter-to-quarter is a pretty sad -1.9%. Really, you just have to pull up the chart from the fall of 2014. It's just like ""Stairway to Heaven,"" only in the opposite direction.What that tells you is that if you do intend to trade Nokia earnings, do so quickly and firmly. Trying to make up for losses usually results in an extension of those losses. And the markets do not make it easy. In the last three reports, Nokia stock was positive heading towards the earnings release. On the day of, NOK fell to an average of 6%.Can GoPro Inc (GPRO) Stock Escape Its Bearish Dogma?For those who want to try their hand at a little Wall Street Russian roulette, a tip of the hat to you! For everybody else, I would just stay away from NOK stock. There are deep-seated fundamental challenges with the company that have yet to be adequately addressed.Until that day comes, Nokia stock remains a liability.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceThe Top 10 Dow Dividend Stocks for FebruaryThe 5 Best Stocks to Buy for Big Emerging Markets ProfitsThe postNokia Corp (ADR) (NOK) Stock Is Still Hobblingappeared first onInvestorPlace."

What Apple's (AAPL) Earnings Say About The Future;February 01, 2017, 10:51:10 AM EDT;"When you regularly give your opinion on something as unpredictable as financial markets, gloating when you get something right is rarely a good idea. That is especially true when those opinions arearchivedfor all to see; it's too easy for a reader to check out that archive and find examples of when the market and hindsight combine to make even logical arguments seem foolish. I am fully aware of that, but when it comes to yesterdaysearnings release from Apple(AAPL), I will still say""told you!""What really matters about the Apple release to investors is certainly not that I got it right, nor is it even that the tech giant returned to growth in revenue for the first time in a year, nor that the already great margins at Apple increased. Those last two are important, but necessarily backward looking, as all hard data in an earnings release are by definition.What matters most is what the report tells us about the future and there the message was somewhat mixed.makeArticleAd();The official guidance for Q1 2017 contained in the release fell just short of Wall Streets expectations, which would normally be enough of a negative to more than offset the good historical results. In this case, though, a look at where Apple succeeded in Q4 2016 suggests that that guidance may just be another example of Apples past tendency to err on the side of under-promising and over-delivering when it comes to guidance. That is why, even though growth stalled last year, AAPL has beaten EPS expectations in three of the last four quarters.First and foremost, iPhone sales hit another record. That is particularly significant as not that long ago many were predicting that Google parent Alphabet (GOOG:GOOGL)s move into the phone business would do Apple some serious harm. It looks now as if those saying that were about as accurate as those that maintained that the Windows phone from Microsoft (MSFT) or the Amazon (AMZN) Fire phone would be the next big thing.The fact is that the iPhone has an iconic status that looks almost impossible to challenge. Even phones that are objectively better in some ways, such as memory capacity, camera resolution, or speaker quality for example, cannot take market share. As Apple advances the iPhone with each release, beating them on those and other fronts becomes harder, but remains, according to the evidence so far, a pointless exercise. As long as that dynamic remains, holding Apple stock and adding to holdings at times of weakness still makes sense for investors.The weakness in this release was mainly in one area; iPad sales declined for the twelfth successive quarter. That, however, was offset to some extent by strong sales of Macs and Apple Watches. For the latter we are reliant on the word of Tim Cook as Apple doesnt release a breakdown of watch sales, but, as I pointed out in the article referenced above, anybody who tried to buy a Series Two watch as a Christmas gift is probably aware that sales were at least more than Apple expected. None were available in any of the five states where I tried and most stores have just now received inventory.That shortage of watches, combined with Cooks admission that they seriously underestimated demand for the iPhone 7 Plus, means that the record sales reported yesterday were achieved with a background of supply constraints. Given that and the fact that there was considerable growth in areas such as services and enterprise operations that still have lots of room for Apple to expand, the message underlying yesterdays earnings is that, despite conventional wisdom, growth can still be achieved."

"Apple, Inc. Earnings: Why the ""Most Accurate"" Apple Analyst Blew It";February 01, 2017, 10:35:00 AM EDT;"On Tuesday afternoon,Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) posted strong earnings results for the first   quarter of its 2017 fiscal year. Revenue beat analysts' forecasts   and the company's own guidance range. Earnings per share   comfortably beat the average analyst estimate as well. Finally,   iPhone sales rose 5% year over year, to 78.3 million units; most   analysts had been expecting a smaller increase -- or even a   decline.Apple posted strong iPhone sales for the critical holiday     quarter. Image source: Apple.makeArticleAd();One of those analysts wrongly expecting an iPhone sales   decline was Ming-Chi Kuo of Taiwan's KGI Securities. In the past   few years, Kuo has gained a reputation among many investors for   being the ""most accurate Apple analyst."" The fact that he whiffed so badly on his iPhone sales forecast   is an important reminder to investors not to rely too much on   analysts' forecasts.Understanding the ""most accurate"" Apple analystMing-Chi Kuo has very good sources -- either in Apple's supply   chain or at the company itself -- giving him advance warning of   new product features and production plans. He isn't perfect, but   he's one of the best sources out there for news about Apple's   future products.Ming-Chi Kuo correctly predicted many features of the iPhone     7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Image source: Apple.For example, Kuocorrectly predictedmost of the key features of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus prior   to those models being officially unveiled last September. That   included obscure details like the fact that there wouldn't be   32GB versions of the new jet black iPhones.Kuo also has a pretty good track record for short-term   shipment forecasts. A few days before Apple's Q1 earnings report   two years ago, he predicted that Apple had sold 73 million   iPhones during the holiday quarter, when most analysts still   expected a shipment number well below 70 million. In fact, Apple   reported that it had shipped 74.5 million iPhones.However, Kuo's competitive advantage appears to be limited to   picking up supply chain rumors. When it comes to estimating   demand for Apple's products, his record is far less pristine.Underestimating iPhone sales by a mileFor the past several months, Ming-Chi Kuo had stuck to a   forecast that Apple would ship 70 million-75 million iPhones in   the first quarter. At the midpoint of that range, iPhone sales   would have been down 3% year over year, whereas iPhone sales   actuallyincreased5%.This doesn't fully capture how far off Kuo's expectations   were, though. Prior to late September, he had expected Apple to   ship just 65 million iPhones in Q1, down 13% year over year.The further you zoom out, the worse Kuo's predictions have   been. Back in April, he stated that in a best-case scenario,   Apple would ship 205 million iPhones for the full 2016 calendar   year. (His worst-case scenario was 190 million shipments.) Apple   actually shipped 215.4 million iPhones for the full year.Don't trust analysts too muchInvestors who soldApple stocklast year -- or decided not to buy it -- based on Kuo's   relatively bearish projections have missed out on a big rally.   Since bottoming out around $90 last May, Apple stock has come   roaring back, reaching $125 in after-hours trading on Tuesday   afternoon. This shows the danger of relying too much on analysts'   forecasts.Apple Stock Performance, data byYCharts.Following top analysts for a stock you own is a good way to   stay up to date on the latest trends and the general outlook for   the next few quarters. However, while Wall Street analysts may in   theory be the ""experts,"" even the best ones can make some big   mistakes. For individual investors, it's important to understand   when to trust an analyst's predictions.For Apple, Ming-Chi Kuo is an important analyst to follow for   learning about potential new products and early production plans,   because of his supply chain connections. However, Apple's sales   results ultimately depend on demand.Being plugged in to the supply chain doesn't help much in   forecasting demand. Perhaps Kuo can accurately estimate how many   components Apple's suppliers are building. That shows how many   devices Apple plans to build -- and, by extension, how much   demand Apple expects to see. But build plans are fluid and   routinely change based on actual demand.Thus, while Kuo is great at calling the play-by-play of what   Apple is doing now, his analysis is less reliable looking further   into the future. Investors who have followed his advice over the   past several quarters just learned that lesson the hard way.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Advanced Micro (AMD) Q4 Loss In Line, View Disappoints;February 01, 2017, 10:23:00 AM EDT;"Advanced Micro DevicesAMDreported loss of 4 cents per share in fourth-quarter 2016, which matched the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Revenues increased 15.4% year over year to $1.11 billion primarily driven by higher GPU sales. However, revenues decreased 15.4% sequentially, primarily due to seasonally soft sales figures for its semi-custom System on Chips (SoCs). Notably, revenues were well above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.07 billion.AMD's shares rose 1.2% in after-hour trading. We note that shares have outperformed the ZacksElectronics Semiconductorsindustry over the last one year. While the industry gave a positive return of 67.2%, AMD gained a whopping 384.6%.The company benefited from strong demand for its graphics products. However, AMD's first-quarter 2017 will be impacted by seasonal weakness.RevenuesAdvanced Micro has two reportable segments -Computing and Graphics(focused on the traditional PC market) andEnterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom(focusing on adjacent high-growth opportunities). The details of these segments are discussed below:Computing and Graphics includes desktop and notebook processors and chipsets, discrete GPUs and professional graphics. This segment accounted for 54.2% of revenues and was up 27.1% sequentially and 27.7% year over year to $600 million.Notably, this segment's revenues grew on an annualized basis for the first time since 2011 as AMD's increased efforts to strengthen this particular segment paid off.Also, the segment posted the highest revenue in the last two years. Client revenues were the highest in the last seven quarters. Graphics processor revenues were also the highest in the last 11 quarters.During the reported quarter, strong adoption of the company's seventh generation notebook accelerated processing units (APUs) drove growth for the company. While desktop processor sales improved on a sequential basis, it declined on a year-over-year basis.The company also won a number of high-end design deals with global original equipment manufacturers over its Ryzen desktop processor that is expected to be launched in early Mar 2017.AMD's Polaris line of GPUs witnessed increased adoption in the fourth quarter. Also, Radeon Pro 400 mobile GPUs were launched, which are used in Apple'sAAPLpremium segment notebooks.The Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment includes server and embedded processors, dense servers, semi-custom SoC products, engineering services and royalties. This segment brought in the remaining 45.8% of revenues, down 39.4% sequentially but up 3.7% year over year to $506 million.The year-over-year increase was driven by higher sales of embedded processor sales and game consoles by MicrosoftMSFTand Sony that are powered by AMD's chips.The segment witnessed increased adoption in targeted markets. Notably, the company continues to gain traction in Naples, Italy.Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS   SurpriseAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. Price, Consensus and   EPS Surprise|Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. QuoteOperating ResultsNon-GAAP gross margin (excluding Wafer Supply Agreement (WSA) charges) was 31.7%, which expanded a whopping 494% sequentially but only 24% on a year-over-year basis.Adjusted operating expenses of $354 million increased 0.6% sequentially and 6.6% year over year.Non-GAAP operating loss was $3 million compared with a loss of $49 million in the year-ago quarter and loss of $293 million in the previous quarter.Mentor Graphics PartnershipAdvanced Micro's recent strategic partnership with Mentor Graphics on embedded technology will offer more choice to embedded developers in the x86 architecture high-performance computing segment. As more and more devices become interconnected, Advanced Micro's efforts to further strengthen its position in the burgeoning embedded markets will reap benefits. (Read:AMD and Mentor Graphics Ink Deal on Embedded Technology).Google DealIn November, the company announced that its FirePro server GPUs have been selected by AlphabetGOOGLto power its cloud platform in 2017. These developments are expected to help the company gain more traction in the GPU space and close in the market share gap with NVIDIA. (Read:AdvancedMicro Scales New Highs, Clinches Deal with Google).Balance SheetAdvanced Micro exited the fourth quarter with cash and cash equivalent balance of $1.26 billion, up $6 million from the previous quarter.During the quarter, the company raised approximately $1.4 billion in cash, before issuance costs, as a result of issuing $690 million of common stock and $700 million of Convertible Notes due 2026.Inventory was $751 million, up 10.8% on a year-over-year basis but down 2.7% sequentially. Total debt (short term and long term) was $1.43 billion, down $0.2 billion sequentially.GuidanceManagement expects first-quarter 2017 revenues to decrease 11% sequentially (+/- 3%), primarily due to seasonal weakness in semi-custom and graphics products. If the company manages to achieve the mid-point of its guidance, it will translate to 18% growth in revenues on a year-over-year basis.Gross margin is likely to be 33% while non-GAAP operating expenses are estimated to be $360 million.On the other hand, interest expense, taxes and others will amount to $30 million. Inventories are expected to remain flat on a sequential basis.Our TakeThe decent fourth-quarter results reflected AMD's improving position in key markets with the introduction of several APUs and GPUs. Moreover, partnerships with the likes of Google for the supply of Radeon Pro GPUs and FirePro server GPUs are positive in our view.Notably the company trails NVIDIA as the second-largest manufacturer of graphics chips for high-end computing and is gradually gaining traction in the space.Additionally, upcoming products like Ryzen and Zen are expected to drive the top line going ahead.Zacks RankAdvanced Micro has Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank stocks here.Zacks' Top 10 Stocks for 2017In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2017?Who wouldn't?

Amgen, Inc. (AMGN) Q4 Earnings Preview;February 01, 2017, 10:13:02 AM EDT;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAs it's customary withAmgen, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMGN), the biotech giant topped analysts' expectation in each of the first three quarters of 2016. Chances are that it'll top expectations once more when it reports its fourth-quarter and full-year 2016 figures on Feb. 2. So if you're following AMGN stock, you don't need to worry about Amgen's profits.makeArticleAd();Source:Richard Masoner via FlickrInstead, you'll want to watch the following items Thursday when Amgen reports its fourth-quarter results:#1: Enbrel Sales TrendCompared to the third quarter of 2015, Amgen reported flat product sales in Q3 2016. This was mostly due to its top-selling drug, Enbrel, losing ground. Sales for the drug had increased 24% in Q1 and 10% in Q2, but in the third quarter, total Enbrel sales were $1.452 billion, versus $1.459 billion in the year-ago period.The problem doesn't seem to be seasonal fluctuation, considering that Enbrel sales grew by 30% in Q3 2015, compared to Q3 2014.7 Awful Stocks You Need To Ditch Right AwayThe problem is that competition is catching up. Amgen usually says, ""offset partially by the impact of competition"" when giving details about Enbrel sales. However, in Q3 2016, ""partially"" was conspicuously absent. Did someone just forget to copy-and-paste? Maybe. Maybe not.AMGN stock holders should pay attention to see if Enbrel will resume growth through increased volume, as opposed to price hike.Enbrel faces three major growth barriers.First, it competes againstAbbVie Inc's(NYSE:ABBV) Humira and Johnson & Johnson's Remicade. This leads to the second challenge.Stiff competition necessitates incremental rebates to payers to maintain its formulary position.The third challenge is the biosimilar availability. For instance, the FDA has approved Erelzi, an Enbrel biosimilar byNovartis AG (ADR)(NYSE:NVS).Put simply, further lackluster Enbrel growth would weigh on AMGN stock.#2: Amgen's Drug PricingInvestors also should look closely at how fast Amgen is hiking prices.I raised concerns about Amgen stockgrowing sales by increasing drug prices, instead of higher volumes, after the company reported its Q2 2015 earnings. Almost two years on, the trend of growing sales with price hikes is still commonplace at AMGN.From a business perspective, it's smart to try to squeeze out every possible dollar from your inventions. However, the U.S. government is standing up against it. President Donald Trump told drugmakers in aJan. 31 meetingthat ""we have to get the prices down.""This won't be good for the top and bottom lines of any drugmaker. However, for a company who thrives on hiking drug prices like AMGN, the downside gets bigger.#3: How Did Repatha Perform?Repatha is heralded as potentially one of Amgen's best sellers. The company said the drug caters to ""serious diseases with significant unmet needs."" However, it brought in a meager $40 million in Q3.One barrier to market growth is that payers have employed utilization-management procedures, which limited patients' ability to gain access to Repatha. Execs said during Q3 earnings call that they're working with payers and providers to allow unlabeled patient access. Investors should look to see if collaborations with payers and providers are yielding significant Repatha growth.Alphabet Inc (GOOGL): The Cheapest $800 Stock I KnowThe drug, which currently competes withSanofiSA (ADR)(NYSE:SNY) andRegeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc's(NASDAQ:REGN) Praluent, had a 55% share of new-to-brand prescriptions (NBRx) in Q4, according to an Amgen presentation at this year's JPMorgan Healthcare Conference. Still, AMGN stock holders probably want to know just how much in sales that amounted to.But it has to be noted that an ongoing court case that Amgen filed against Sanofi and Regeneron onpatent infringementgrounds is tipping the scale in Rapatha's favor for now.Finally, investors should pay attention to see if low expenses is continuing and will continue at Amgen. Since the beginning of 2015, AMGN has reduced its total expenses by roughly 3.7% to 13.22%. Keeping expenses low will be critical to future profitability, especially in Trump's recent focus on drugmakers.Earnings apart, I believe the uncertainties surrounding the future make AMGN stock less attractive.As of this writing, Craig Adeyanju did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceApple Inc.

Stock Market News for February 01, 2017;February 01, 2017, 10:10:00 AM EDT;"U.S. stocks ended mostly lower on Tuesday amid signs that momentum following President Donald Trump's election victory in November was fading. His signing of an executive order to temporary restrict immigration saw weekend chaos and backlash, eventually affecting stocks. Industrial, technology and financials shares tanked outweighing gains among traditional safe sectors including health-care and utilities. Meantime, a gauge of consumer confidence retreated in January from its highest level in 15 years. Despite such setbacks, major indexes ended the month higher in what were their first January gains since 2013, while the Nasdaq ended in the green on Tuesday thanks to sharp gains in biotech stocks.makeArticleAd();For a look at the issues currently facing the markets, make sure to read today'sAhead of Wall Streetarticle.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) declined 0.5% or 107.04 points, to close at 19,864.09, with 22 of the 30 blue-chip companies closing lower. The S&P 500 fell 0.1% to close at 2,278.87, with six of the 11 main sectors finishing in negative territory. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 5,614.79, gaining a meagre 0.02%. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) declined 1.7% to settle at 11.68. A total of around 4.08 billion shares were traded on the NYSE on Tuesday.Political Concern WeighsMarket bulls argue that Trump's business-friendly policy focused on tax cuts, deregulation and infrastructure spending, remains a positive for the economy, but, investors were put to notice on Tuesday that the path higher might no longer be so smooth.Investors' grappled over Trump's executive order to tighten immigration rules. The order would temporarily ban immigration into the U.S. from Iraqi, Syrian, Iranian, Sudanese, Libyan, Somali and Yemeni citizens, while it also seeks ""extreme vetting"" procedures for those it did allow to enter the U.S. Such an executive order spawned legal challenges, congressional criticism and widespread protests.The market rally that catapulted the Dow over 20000 last week has stalled, with investors backing away from shares of industrial and financial companies and picking up havens like gold. You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy)   stocks here.The Nasdaq, however, finished in positive territory due to gains in biotech stocks. The iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology index (IBB) rallied 2.8% (read more:Drug Stocks Rally on Trump Meet with Pharma Bigwigs).Monthly GainsThe main indexes posted a third consecutive round of monthly gains in January. The Dow added 0.5% for the month, the S&P 500 was 1.8% higher and the Nasdaq Composite rose 4.3%. Projections for stronger economic growth and upbeat corporate earnings boosted US stocks for the first January rise in five years. Stocks rallied on hopes that the new administration's policies including lowering of taxes and cutting regulations will bolster economic growth.The materials sector has fueled the rally, advancing 5.1% so far this year, following a 14% gain in 2016. Companies listed on the sector have benefited from Trump's infrastructure spending promises and a rise in the price of many raw materials. Technology shares that trailed behind the broader market last year have also recorded sharp gains this year. The sector has risen 3.6% in January, its best month since last July.Earnings in the final quarter of 2016 came on the heels of growth in the third quarter that snapped a 15-month decline in earnings. We now have results from 171 S&P 500 members that have reported as of Jan 30th. Total earnings for these 171 index members are up 6% from the same period last year on 3.1% higher revenues, with 64.3% beating EPS estimates and 54.4% beating revenue estimates (read more:Is the Bar Higher for the Q4 Earnings Season?).Stocks That Made HeadlinesApple Q1 Earnings and Revenues Beat, Increase   Y/YShares of Apple Inc.

Apple, Inc. Can Still Set Records;February 01, 2017, 10:00:00 AM EDT;"Image source: Apple.It's been a while sinceApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) posted a bona fide blowout quarter, but I think   it's safe to say that last quarter qualifies.makeArticleAd();The Mac maker set an all-time record high with quarterly   revenue, which came in at $78.4 billion. That's a few billion   higher than the $75.9 billion in sales that Apple generated a   year ago, and above the high end of Apple's own guidance ($78   billion). Naturally, that was driven by strong iPhone sales,   another record at 78.3 million. This all comes as the iPhone 7   was arguably the most incremental model update in years, keeping   the same overall industrial design with no clear must-have   feature. Combined with the perennial supply constraints, it's   rather impressive that the company was able to move that many   smartphones.Other quarterly records set in Q4 were earnings per share   ($3.36), services revenue ($7.2 billion), Mac revenue ($7.2   billion), Apple Watch units (who knows?!), and Apple Watch   revenue (your guess is as good as mine). Four out of Apple's five   geographical operating segments also set fresh highs (all but   Greater China). That's what I call comprehensive performance.Two cameras are better than oneAs usual, the iPhone was the star of the show, comprising   nearly 70% of sales. While sales were up 5%, sell-through was up   8% thanks to robust demand. In line with CFO Luca Maestri'sprediction in October, average selling prices (ASPs) bounced back sequentially with a   vengeance. ASPs were depressed for a few quarters in 2016   following the launch of the $400 iPhone SE, but have now   rebounded to $695 -- pretty comparable to last year's $691.Data source: SEC filings. Chart by author. Calendar quarters     shown.This tells investors a few things, some obvious and others   less so. Clearly, the iPhone 7 Plus is a hit, likely due to the   dual-camera system that is the most notable differentiating   feature. On the earnings call, CEO Tim Cook noted that the mix   was skewed toward the Plus models more than in any prior cycle   (this is the third year that Apple has had Plus models with   5.5-inch displays). Cook even acknowledged later in the call that   Apple did not predict iPhone 7 Plus demand very well, which   adversely affected production plans.Additionally, Apple finally increased the entry-level storage   to 32 GB in 2016, at long last addressing an increasingly   prominent customer complaint. The financial risk to that move was   removing the upsell incentive, and the $100 to $200 that goes   with it. If 32 GB of storage is sufficient, a larger proportion   of customers may opt for the base model instead of upgrading; 16   GB has long been woefully insufficient, virtually assuring strong   upgrade activity. The good news is that Apple has maintained a   relatively comparable mix of upgrades, as evidenced by the strong   ASP.Macs and iPadsThe fact that Mac revenue hit a new all-time high shows that   Apple still has tricks up its sleeve. We're talking about a   business that's over 40 years old, after all. The new MacBook   Pros with Touch Bar were significantly constrained during the   quarter, but the related price increase appears to have been able   to help Mac ASPs by quite a bit. Mac ASPs jumped sequentially   from $1,175 to $1,348; this is the first time in nearly three   years that this figure was above $1,300.There wasn't a whole lot of news on the iPad front, in part   because Apple didn't update its tablet lineup in the fall. Apple   sold 13.1 million units, down 19% from a year ago. iPad revenue   fell more than that due to declining ASPs ($423). The more   affordable iPads continue to prove rather popular. Cook said the   company has some exciting things in the pipeline for iPad,   potentially referring to the rumors around other display sizes or   the Apple Pencil 2.Services to $50 billionApple's services business has just officially become a $25   billion business on a trailing-12-month basis. Management   ambitiously hopes todoublethis business within the next four years, targeting $50 billion   in annual revenue in 2020. That's an aggressive goal, but also in   line with the company's efforts to shift investor attention   toward recurring revenue sources.CFO Luca Maestri noted that the App Store continues to be the   main driver of growth, thanks to increased buying activity within   the installed based as well as new users coming to the platform.   The music business, including both downloads and streaming, has   started growing again over the past three quarters. iCloud   storage upsells are also growing ""very quickly,"" as is AppleCare.   Simply put, the plethora of services that Apple offers are all   faring well.Wrapping upShare repurchases came in at $11 billion, which included $5   billion in open market purchases and a $6 billion accelerated   share repurchase (ASR) program. That's the ninth ASR for those   keeping score at home. The company retired 65.3 million shares   during the quarter thanks to these aggressive repurchases, which   contributed to the record EPS due to its accretive effects.That puts cumulative share repurchases at $143.7 billion out   of the current $175 billion authorization. Apple updates its   capital return program every spring, typically alongside its   April earnings release. There's plenty of room to accommodate   Apple's typical level of repurchases, and investors can look   forward to an update next quarter.In terms of fundamentals, the results were a blowout. Investor   reaction, on the other hand, is another topic. Shares jumped over   4% in extended trading, and Apple hasn't traded around $125 since   mid-2015. I still have doubts about Apple enjoying any semblance   of multiple expansion, but the business is as strong as ever.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

ADP Private-Sector Jobs Hit 246K, Way Above Estimates;February 01, 2017, 09:52:00 AM EDT;"Wednesday, February 1, 2017makeArticleAd();Payroll processing giant ADPADPhas released its January private sector jobs report before the bell this morning, posting a far-better-than-expected 246K new jobs for the month. Consensus expectations had been for 164K. December's total was revised downward by 2000 jobs to 151K, which is the range in which the U.S. labor market had been settling prior to this morning's number.The Services group still rules the roost, with 201K new January jobs in the private sector, whereas Goods brought in 46K. Manufacturing and Mining totals, while not incredibly strong, at least have swung to the positive - 15K and 6K, respectively. Healthcare put up a strong 49K, but the top two sectors were in Professional/Business Services at 71K and Trade/Transportation/Utilities at 63K.Good weather in January can likely take some of this credit. Medium-sized companies (between 50-499 employees) brought in the lion's share with 102K, followed by large companies (500+ employees) at 83K, with Small firms (under 50) picking up the remaining 62K. For years, at least seemingly, it had been small-business hiring which had kept the labor market strong. This looks to be shifting.The ADP report serves as somewhat of a forward indicator toward the monthly non-farm payroll results from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), which also includes Government jobs and will be released Friday. However, the analyst consensus for the BLS total is 174K as of now, down considerably from today's private-sector results. Historically, the ADP and BLS numbers don't always gibe in the near-term, but upon revisions in future months they tend to track each other pretty consistently.What some economists predict going forward, though, is a labor market that shows increasing difficulties with filling open job positions. This is part of what it means to have an Unemployment rate at around 4.7%. This results in wage growth picking up, which we've also seen some evidence of lately. So the potential problems with finding employees with the skill-sets to fill certain positions - which may be exacerbated by the Trump administration's rather draconian policies regarding immigration reform, in that immigrants traditionally absorb many jobs on the lower levels of the pay-scale - may manifest in a stagnating labor market going forward.Earnings UpdateAppleAAPLput up Q1 2017 earnings numbers after the bell that were reminiscent of the tech giant's late-era Steve Jobs years, blowing the doors off expectations for iPhone sales in the quarter.

Apple Just Showed the Mac Is Back - What Does It Mean For PCs?;February 01, 2017, 09:42:00 AM EDT;"Apple's (AAPL) fiscal first-quarter results came in better-than-expected, thanks in part to strong iPhone sales. However, it's the noticeable growth in the Mac unit that has caught investors' eyes.During the period, Applesold5.374 million Macs, generating $7.244 billion in revenue. Thats a 1% year over year increase in units and more importantly, a 7% increase in revenue. It shows that despite all the media criticism about the new MacBook Pro with the TouchBar, Apples products are resonating with the market.Drexel Hamilton analyst Brian White said the Mac sales came in well above his 4.74 million unit projection.makeArticleAd();The results helped Apple return to growth, something that's been nipping at the heels of Apple and its investors for some time.Couple this fact, along withstrong fourth-quarter resultsfrom Intel and its Client Computing unit and it looks like PC sales, which have been in decline for so long, are finally returning to some semblance of normalcy.Intel, which reported earnings last week, saw strength from its next-generation Kaby Lake CPUs. Credit Suisse analysts, led by John Pitzer noted, ""[Original design manufacturers] attributed better than expected builds to the introduction of INTC's next-gen Kaby Lake CPUs, VR-ready NBs and MacBooks, and stronger than expected demand at US [original equipment manufacturers].""Research firm Gartner noted fourth-quarter PC shipments totaled 72.6 million, down 3.7% year-over-year. However, Apple's continued push into the enterprise helped it, as there was a refresh in the business community, in addition to strength in the gaming market.For years, the PC market has been in a sharp decline and while Gartner's figures show an industry still in decline, the decline is moderating. With Apple's essentially flat unit growth, that means it's taking market share, as well as profit share, something that bodes well for Apple and its shareholders.Click to see original TweetThe broader PC market is likely never return to the growth of the 1990's, thanks in part to mobile devices. And while strong, the influx of subsets like gaming PCs are too small to boost the overall market.However, with Apple's latest innovations to its Mac lineup (and more tocome, per CEO Tim Cook) and the rise of niche PC markets, the sector is no longer an albatross area for investors."
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL): The Cheapest $800 Stock I Know;February 01, 2017, 09:40:32 AM EDT;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsDisruption is everywhere.Amazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) disrupts how we shop, whileAirbnbdisrupts where we stay.Tesla Motors Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) disrupts what we drive, andUbereven disruptswhetherwe drive. If a teen with 2 million Instagram followers can disrupt how billion-dollar businesses find customers, the rest of us need to dive in and start swimming  or at least buy the one stock which has its hands in all of the above:Alphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL).makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockSimply put, GOOGL stock is the most innovative, most disruptive and cheapest $800 equity I know.Let me explain.Silicon Valley money manager Michael Moe and his team at GSV Asset Management produce a provocative weekly newsletter dedicated to highlighting where they think the world is going. While doing research for myBullseye Brief, one of their recent pieces got me thinking about innovation in more tangible terms. The team ranked eight global technology companies based on their involvement across 22 cutting-edge categories. Hands down, Alphabet ranks No. 1, capturing 21 of 22.Innovation LeadersCuriously, all eight GSV-highlighted companies have dedicated efforts in the areas of artificial intelligence, big data and cloud services, making these three the Holy Grail of innovation.The first two come as no surprise, as data gathering and analysis are critical to predicting behavior, enabling companies to target consumers accordingly. Web services, which is now the fastest-growing segment for Amazon, is less obvious but nonetheless a clear indicator these innovators want to get bigger by serving as the backbone for other companies.10 Stocks to Buy That Already Make America GreatThis is key, and since Google already commands 49% of the global online advertising market according to Pivotal Research analyst Brian Wieser, I'll bet on GOOGL.MoonshotMuch of Google's innovative efforts happen at its off-site research center called Google X, aka the Moonshot Factory. It's run by a futurist named Astro Teller, and I highly recommend hisTED Talkexplaining how Google X approaches innovation:Identify a problem affecting millions of people.Find or propose a radical solution for solving that problem.Move full speed ahead if there's reason to believe technology for such a radical solution could actually be built.He says Google X people spend most of their time ""breaking things and trying to prove they're wrong"" but believes that's their secret  what makes Googlers different. By ""killing"" more projects than they approve, their success rate rises. Alphabet spent $13.8 billion last year on research and development - the second highest number of any company in the world behind Amazon, and second highest as a percentage of sales among the eight innovation leaders.R&D as % of RevenueAlphabet invests a staggering amount of money to fund R&D, both because it can and because it has to. With three times more online advertising than its next closest competitor, GOOGL is a cash cow.By the same token, it has significant overlap with all seven competitors in the most obvious categories - like robotics and AI- and each of these companies is hungry to dominate.There's no letting up in this crowd. Innovate or die.What's GOOGL Stock Worth?Ultimately, the question is value: What do we pay?I like to compare the growth we're getting (earnings) with the price we're paying (price-to-earnings, or P/E). This is called a price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG), and it's an intuitive way to compare apples to apples.Using 2017 consensus estimates tracked by Bloomberg, GOOGL stock is tucked right in the middle of the pack. Its PEG ratio is 1.08. PEGs below 1 are cheap, and PEGs approaching 2 are expensive.PEG ratios are revealing.First of all, no one should buyMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT). It's neither a growth stock nor a value play.Alibaba Group Holding Ltd(NYSE:BABA) is a tad expensive, but not excessively so, especially since many consider ittheChinese consumer trading vehicle.Amazon is attractive, so areApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) andFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB), both of which I have written up as longs and currently own.Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Has a New Hero: Services!Samsung(OTCMKTS:SSNLF), I admit is a mystery. It'ssocheap. I can only surmise its limited German and S. Korean listings deter U.S. investors, as does the $1,700 stock price. It needs to split at least 10-to-1.The TradeSell the GOOGL April $800 puts at $20 to initiate a long-biased position.If the stock pulls back and trades through the $800 strike price, I'm assigned shares and become a buyer. If Google continues making new highs, I pocket the premium. I am content either way. Google's chart indicates initial technical support around $780, and significant long-term support $700-$725.The reason I'm selling puts rather than buying the stock is because GOOGL stock has recently risen to a new all-time high. I know new highs tend to beget new highs (momentum traders buy strength), but I'm a value buyer at heart.Adam Johnson is Founder and Author ofBullseye Brief, an investment newsletter that presents thematic and actionable ideas.

(NASDAQ:AAPL-Free Report) put an old-school beat-down on Q1 2017 estimates from the Zacks consensus: $3.36 per share on sales of $78.4 billion easily topped the #3.22 per share and $76.93 billion expected. iPhone sales totaled 78.3 million in the quarter, ahead of the 77.3 million in the company's unit guidance. Gross margins came in-line with expectations at 38.5%.Importantly, the company has finally ended its string of decreasing revenue and unit growth.

Revenues of $2.07 billion beat the Zacks consensus estimate of $2.06 billion. The after-market has been trying to sort these difficulties, first trading down 1% on the news, whereas the stock has now swung into positive territory in the late session.The debut earnings report for Arconic (NYSE:ARNC-Free Report) since the split from Alcoa (NYSE:AA-Free Report) was positive, if unspectacular. Earnings of 12 cents per share on quarterly sales of$2.97 billion beat the Zacks consensus estimates of 11 cents and $2.92 billion in revenues. Margin expansion was evident in all of Arconic's sectors.

Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Has a New Hero: Services!;February 01, 2017, 09:03:15 AM EDT;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) reported its fiscal first-quarter earnings on Tuesday after the bell, and it kicked the year off the right way. Apple set an all-time quarterly revenue record - snapping its streak of declines - and broke its previous iPhone sales record. AAPL stock is up strongly Wednesday morning as a result.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');Source: AppleBut the star of yesterday's show wasn't the iPhone. It was the Services division, which includes the App Store, Apple Pay, iTunes, AppleCare and Apple Music. Services didn't just set another record - it also posted the strongest year-over-year growth of any AAPL division.Services Is on Fire, Led by the App StoreApple reported that the quarterly revenue for its Services division topped $7.17 billion for Q1, an increase of 18% compared to the previous year. If that sounds like a lot of money for what is largely made up of mobile payment transaction fees and digital content, it is. In comparison,Netflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX) experienced its largest-ever subscriber growth in the final quarter of 2016, leading it to post revenue of $2.48 billion.During the AAPL earnings conference call, CEO Tim Cook noted that he expects the Services division to bethe size of a Fortune 100 company by the end of the year. Other key information about the Services division from that earnings call includes:App Store revenue for December alone was a record-setting $3 billionThere are now 2.2 million apps in the App Store, and AAPL paid out over $20 billion to developers in 2016The number of Apple Pay users has tripled over the past year, with transaction volume up over 500% year-over-yearAppleCare and storage services (iCloud) both set all-time recordsApple's music business grew for the third straight quarterWhy Services Revenue is ImportantYou might not know it based on Apple's record-setting iPhone sales this quarter, but selling hardware is tough.The Top 10 Dow Dividend Stocks for FebruaryOnce a consumer has an iPhone in his or her hands, it becomes very difficult to convince them to spend a minimum $649 to ditch that smartphone for a new one. In one sense, a huge installed user base - which AAPL has, withmore than 1 billion iOS devices in active use- works against the company. When the iPhone first began to take off, AAPL was selling to people who'd never owned one before. Now, that pool of easy sales is dwindling. And Apple is left in the tougher position of convincing its installed user base to upgrade.Thus the hand-wringing about slowing iPhone sales.Apple's Services division largely benefits from that huge installed user base, though. True, AAPL only gets one shot at selling these customers AppleCare. But once they own an iPhone, iPad, iPod, Mac, Apple Watch or AppleTV, they begin to explore Apple's other services. They are increasingly adopting Apple Pay. They are in a prime position to buy movies on their Apple TV. They are perfect candidates to subscribe to Apple Music. There are plenty of hooks for storing data on iCloud. And of course, there is the App Store and the lure of its millions of apps.Apple's Services revenue doesn't come in big chunks like selling an iPhone. It's $9.99 a month here, 99 cents for an app there, a few cents for a transaction. But it adds up, especially when over a billion customers are generating it.More importantly, that revenue doesn't drop off the same way hardware revenue does when people stop buying new iPhones.Some services - like iCloud and Apple Music - are subscription-based. AAPL keeps automatically billing the customer's card every month regardless of whether their iPhone is brand new or five years old. Apple Pay revenues are increasing as more countries and businesses accept it and iPhone owners grow more accustomed to using it.Bottom Line for AAPLPeople never stop buying apps. They may slow down after the initial rush of a new device, but developers keep bring enticing new games and other apps to the App Store. That means the 1 billion users continue to download.Trade of the Day: Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock No Longer a Home RunJust look at the 40 million-plusSuper Mario Rundownloads from the App Storein only four days.How many iPhones will AAPL sell two years from now? No one knows for sure, but odds are it won't be many more than it does now. On the other hand, Apple is confident its highflying App Store, Apple Pay and other services will see Services division revenue double in that time.The iPhone may have driven Apple stock growth over the past decade. But Services revenue is increasingly important as AAPL stock searches for that elusive next hardware hit.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 Stocks to Buy That Already Make America GreatCan Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Jump Over These Hurdles?The Only 3 Vanguard Funds You Need to Build a PortfolioThe postApple Inc.

The figure marked a 3.3% rise year-over-year.The Top 10 Dow Dividend Stocks for FebruaryThe strong statistic was fueled in part by Apple's iPhone 7 sales, which were especially strong, topping the total from the previous month. The company sold 78.29 million iPhones in its fourth quarter.The figure was nearly 5% higher than the previous year, or about 4 million more than it sold in 2015's fourth quarter. The company's iPhone business makes up about 69% of its revenue for the quarter.iPad sales were weaker for Apple to end fiscal 2016, falling by 22% to $5.5 billion, which suggests that the newer iPad Pro models are not as hot as the company hoped they would be.Mac computers were 7% higher over the same quarter of 2015, amounting to $7.24 billion.AAPL stock boomed 3% after hours.Electronic Arts Inc.

Apple, Inc.'s Record Quarter Returns the Company to Growth;February 01, 2017, 08:43:00 AM EDT;"After market on closed on Tuesday, tech giantApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) put to rest any doubts about the company's ability   to post strong holiday results. Shares moved a few percentage   points higher immediately after the company released its figures   for its Dec. 31-ending first fiscal quarter of 2017. Apple's   revenue and earnings exceeded both management's own forecast for   the quarter and analysts' consensus estimate.Image source: Apple.makeArticleAd();Here's a look at some of the biggest takeaways from the   results.Financial resultsMetricQ1 2017Q1 2016Year-Over-Year ChangeRevenue$78.4 billion$75.9 billion3.3%Earnings per share$3.36$3.282.4%Gross profit margin38.5%$40.1%(160 basis points)Data source: AppleQ1 2017 press release. Table by author.Apple's revenue reached an all-time high of $78.4 billion, up   3.3% from the year-ago quarter and above the company's guidance   for $76 billion to $78 billion. In addition, Apple's EPS of $3.28   easily exceeded the midpoint of its guidance range for about   $3.17.Segment resultsThe iPhone remained crucial to Apple's overall results,   accounting for nearly 70% of total revenue during the quarter.   With a 5% year-over-year increase in iPhone revenue, the product   segment played a key role in Apple's better-than-expected   financial results.But the tech giant's services segment, which accounts for   sales from the App Store, iTunes, Apple Music, iCloud, Apple Pay,   licensing, and other services, was also important. Services   revenue was up 18% year over year, accounting for 9.1% of the   quarter's total results -- up from 8% in the year-ago quarter.   Apple CEO Tim Cook commented specifically on Apple's services   segment performance, saying the growth was ""led by customer   activity on the App Store.""Data source: Apple Q1 2017 press release. Chart by     author.Another bright spot from Apple's segment results was Mac. With   the help of its new MacBook Pro, the segment's revenue increased   7% year over year.However, not all of Apple's product segments were on the rise   during the quarter. Apple's iPad revenue continued its downward   trend, with revenue falling 22% year over year. Other products   revenue, which includes sales of Apple TV, Apple Watch, Beats   products, iPod, and accessories, saw its revenue decline 8% year   over year. But Apple was careful to note in its first-quarter   press release that despite the decline in other products revenue,   Apple Watch revenue hit an all-time high.GuidanceApple also notably said it expects revenue growth to continue   in the company's second quarter -- an important guide,   considering the company reported three straight quarters of   year-over-year revenue declines in fiscal 2016. Apple guided for   second-quarter revenue to be in the range of $51.5 billion to   $53.5 billion, up from $50.6 billion in the year-ago quarter.Looking beyond the financial results for Apple's second   quarter, Cook said the Apple team is ""excited"" about the products   in its pipeline.The strong quarter for the tech giant, along with a nice   return to growth for the current quarter and for expected revenue   in Q2, reinforces the company's ability to drive results for   shareholders even in a post hyper-iPhone-growth era.Cook was pleased with the company's performance: ""Our team   executed extremely well in the face of strong macroeconomic   headwinds. We are very happy with the continued strong growth in   revenue from services, thanks to the incredible strength of the   Apple ecosystem and our growing base of over 1 billion active   devices.""10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology Index (ETF) (IBB) Shows Signs of Hope;February 01, 2017, 08:13:28 AM EDT;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBiotechnology stocks - as represented by theiShares Nasdaq Biotechnology Index (ETF)(NASDAQ:IBB) - rallied about 2.8% on Tuesday. As a result, the IBB ETF left behind on the daily chart what technical analysts refer to as a bullish outside reversal day.makeArticleAd();The rally came on the back of a meeting with President Donald Trump and several large pharmaceutical CEOs at the White House on Tuesday. While more clarity is needed as to what the Trump administration's exact agenda is for the pharmaceutical space - which includes the world of biotechnology - for the moment, Tuesday's price action in these stocks must be respected.Throughout the presidential campaign, the pharmaceutical sector was an area of focus by the candidates. Stocks within this sector saw plenty of gyrations as a result. While the broader stock market and many sectors pushed to new highs following the election results last November, pharma and biotech stocks largely speaking to this day remain range-bound and have shown relative weakness.IBB ETF ChartsThe best way to illustrate this is by the following ratio chart where I divided the IBB ETF by theS&P 500- as represented by the popularSPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust(NYSEARCA:SPY). Note the clear relative weakness that biotech stocks have shown versus the broader stock market.While the fund showed some relative strength on Tuesday, the series of lower highs thus far remains well intact.Click to EnlargeOn the multiyear weekly chart, we see the choppy sideways range that biotechnology stocks have been in since early 2016.The Top 10 Dow Dividend Stocks for FebruaryFrom this angle - and through the lens of directional longer-term investors - this range should be respected. Because until it resolves in one direction or another, IBB's price action is just pushing this group of stocks sideways.Click to EnlargeThe week isn't yet over, and it's difficult to see this on the multiyear chart, but last week and this week (so far), the IBB is marking the charts with long bullish candles. Intraweek selloffs so far are getting bought. This may be an initial bullish signal worth paying attention to.The area around $265-$270 on the IBB is getting increasingly important as support.On the daily chart, we see that the IBB etf has narrowed its trading range since last fall by making a series of higher lows and lower highs. Of note, however, is the breakaway gap to the upside from last November following the presidential election results.Click to EnlargeWhile the IBB is still trotting sideways, the lower end of the post-election up-gap continues to hold as support.Lastly, let's note the bullish price action from yesterday, Jan. 31. The IBB ETF initially traded lower before quickly snapping higher and closing near the very highs of the day. The daily candle fully engulfed the previous 10 days' worth of price action.Trade of the Day: Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock No Longer a Home RunActive investors could try to play some follow-through buying in the fund. If and when this takes hold, it should be able to push the IBB ETF quickly back toward the $285-$290 area for now.Any major bearish reversal, however, and erasing of Tuesday's rally would be bearish and a sign to get out of bullish trades until the next bullish reversal rears its head.Like what you see?

Apple (AAPL) Q1 Earnings and Revenues Beat, Increase Y/Y;February 01, 2017, 07:30:00 AM EDT;"makeZacksArticleAd();Shares ofApple Inc.AAPLwere up over 3% in aftermarket trading following better-than-expected first quarter of fiscal 2017 results.Earnings of $3.36 per share and revenues of $78.4 billion easily topped the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.22 and $76.9 billion. On a year-over-year basis, both metrics registered growth of 2.4% and 3.3%.Product DetailsThe good show was driven by impressive sales of Apple's latest smartphone model iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. Performance of Apple's Services business was also impressive.Total iPhone unit sales came in at about 78.3 million, up 5% year over year. Revenues from iPhone also grew 5% from the year-ago quarter to $54.4 billion (69.4% of total revenue).Services, which include revenues from Internet Services, App store, Apple Music, AppleCare, Apple Pay, licensing and other services, surged 18% year over year (with extra one week in the quarter) to nearly $7.2 billion. App Store sales in December alone topped $3 billion. Apple said that it expects Services ""revenues to be the size of a Fortune 100 company this year.""Apple Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseApple Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise|Apple Inc. QuoteManagement also noted that Apple Pay reported transaction volume growth of 500%, buoyed by expansion to markets like Spain, Japan, Russia and New Zealand. At present Apple Pay is available in 13 markets.Apple Mac unit sales were up 1% year over year to approximately 5.4 million, while revenues grew 7% from the prior-year quarter to $7.2 billion.Coming to iPad, Apple sold 13.1 million units in the quarter, down 19% year over year. Revenues of $5.5 billion were down 22% from the prior year quarter.Other products, which include revenues from Apple TV, Apple Watch, Beats products, iPod and Apple-branded and third-party accessories, declined 8% year over year to over $4 billion. Again, there were no data available on Apple Watch sales or its latest product launch, AirPods.Geographical PerformanceDemand for Apple's products improved across most of the geographical regions except greater China. As much as 64% of sales were from the International markets.Americas (the biggest market for Apple) generated revenues of approximately $32 billion in the quarter, up 9% year over year.Europe generated nearly $18.5 billion in revenues, up 3% on a year-over-year basis.Revenues from Japan rose 20% year over year to $5.8 billion while the rest of Asia Pacific generated revenues of $5.8 billion, up 8% year over year.Owing to persistent macroeconomic weakness, Apple revenues declined around 12% year over year in the Greater China region to $16.2 billion.MarginsGross margin was 38.5%, a decline of 160 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter.Operating expenses increased 9% year over year to $6.8 billion due to higher research & development expenses as well as selling, general and administrative expenses. As a result, operating margin plunged 210 bps from the year-ago quarter to 29.8%.Balance Sheet and Cash FlowApple's cash and cash equivalents (and short-term marketable securities) were $60.5 billion at the end of the quarter, compared with $67.2 billion at fiscal 2016-end. Long-term debt was $73.6 billion compared with $75.4 billion at the end of fiscal 2016.For the quarter, cash generated from operating activities was $27.1 billion.Apple returned about $15 billion in capital returns this quarter through dividends and share repurchases. Apple also said that it has so far returned $201 billion out of the $250 billion capital returns program announced in April last year.The company also declared its quarterly dividend of 57 cents per share payable on Feb 16 to shareholders of record as on Feb13.GuidanceFor the second quarter of fiscal 2017, Apple forecasts revenues in a range of $51.5 billion to $53.5 billion.Gross margin is expected within 38% to 39%, while operating expenses are projected within $6.5 billion to $6.6 billion. Other income/ (expense) is likely to be $400 million, while tax rate is expected to be 26%.Our TakeBetter-than-expected iPhone sales have definitely come as a respite. But the macroeconomic headwinds remain for now, especially in China, one of the high-growth regions for Apple. Also, competition from local players has been hindering iPhone's growth in China.Nonetheless, Apple is optimistic about long-term growth prospects in regions like China and India. In the last few months, Apple has increased its focus on India, which is expected to become the second largest smartphone market in the world. In fiscal 2016, Apple sales in India grew approximately 50% over the prior fiscal.Apple's Services business is also expected to remain strong as it is mostly dependent on the already installed Apple devices. Also, in the long run, Apple is expected to benefit from its robust cash position, strength in technology and the ecosystem that it has built, given its loyal customer base. Further, its enterprise collaborations with the likes of Deloitte, IBM Corp.IBM, CiscoCSCOand SAP SESAPare expected to be important long-term growth drivers.Currently, Apple has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Pops Following Vindicating Q1 Earnings;January 31, 2017, 05:23:50 PM EDT;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) needed a strong showing in its recently completed quarter, in the shadow of three straight quarters of waning revenue and waning earnings. It got it, sending AAPL stock up 2.6% in Tuesday's after-hours trading.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');Source: AppleFor the company's first fiscal quarter ending in December, Apple reported income of $3.36 per share on revenue of $78.4 billion. Both were better than analyst expectations for a profit of $3.22 per share on revenue of $77.42 billion. AAPL posted income of $3.28 per share in the same quarter a year earlier, when it generated $75.87 billion in sales.CEO Tim Cook commented on the results:""We're thrilled to report that our holiday quarter results generated Apple's highest quarterly revenue ever, and broke multiple records along the way. We sold more iPhones than ever before and set all-time revenue records for iPhone, Services, Mac and Apple Watch.""CFO Luca Maestri added:""Our outstanding business performance resulted in a new all-time record for earnings per share, and over $27 billion in operating cash flow. We returned nearly $15 billion to investors through share repurchases and dividends during the quarter, bringing cumulative payments through our capital return program to over $200 billion.""Apple EarningsWhile AAPL stock has been a strong growth machine since unveiling the first iPhone a little over a decade ago, per-share profits have been lower on a year-over-year basisin each of the prior three quarters. The same goes for revenue. Q1's numbers largely rekindle confidence in the company's prospects.Almost as important as Apple's top and bottom lines for the first fiscal quarter of the year was the number of iPhones it sold during the accounting period in question.The Top 10 Dow Dividend Stocks for FebruaryBroadly speaking, the pace of sales growth of the iPhone has been slowing as saturation and better competition chip away at Apple's prowess in the market. TheiPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus were released in September, before the end of the previous quarter.The bulk of the device's sales, though, came in the subsequent quarter beginning in October. During that three-month span, the company sold 78.2 million of the smartphone ($58.4 billion worth of the device), versus expectations of 77.3 million. The company didn't indicate how many of those were iPhone 7 phones, but Cowen & Co. had forecast 58.5 million iPhone 7's were sold during fiscal Q1.The company's fast-growing digital product arm - music, video and apps - drove respectable revenue during the quarter as well.Digital content as a revenue source had not been a priority for AAPL until sales of Macs, iPhones and iPads began to slow down last year. The companyturned up the heat on this line last year, however, and has turned the unit into Apple's second-biggest piece of revenue pie. Last quarter it contributed $7.17 billion worth of sales, up 18% from year-ago levels, and accounting for 9% of total sales. Analysts had only expected $7.07 billion worth of services revenue.Apple is evenmulling the creation of its own original television shows and movies, following in the footsteps of on-demand video rivalsNetflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX) andAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN).Geographically, the Americas continue to provide the bulk of Apple's revenue, though China and its neighbors provided the majority of revenuegrowthlast quarter.The Americas accounted for $31.9 billion in Apple's sales last quarter, up 58%. China put $16.2 billion worth of revenue on the table, up 85% year-over-year. Japan and the rest of the Asia-Pacific area only contributed $5.9 billion in sales, but that tally was up 119% versus the tally from the same quarter a year earlier.Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD): The Turnaround Is Legit!The future of Apple's business in China hangs in the balance. President Donald Trump's policy plans are said by some to be the beginning of a trade war.Not only would that make iPhones more difficult to sell in China, but would strain Apple's relationships with key manufacturers of iPhone, iPad and Mac components.Bottom Line for AAPL StockLooking ahead, Apple anticipates revenue of between $51.5 billion and $53.5 billion for the quarter currently underway. The company doesn't provide earnings guidance, but as of the latest look, the pros collectively believe Apple will earn $2.09 per share of Apple stock on revenue of $53.94 billion.Both figures are higher than year-ago comparisons, and those estimates may well be adjusted higher before the second quarter numbers are posted.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceThe 10 Best Stocks to Buy for 2017: The Experts' PicksThe Only 3 Vanguard Funds You Need to Build a PortfolioThe 10 Best Index Funds for 2017, 2018, 2019 ...The postApple Inc.

But don't expect the large-cap tech partnerships to end there, and instead expect them to extend to the likes ofFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) andSalesforce.com, inc.(NYSE:CRM)? Headline-making deals like this could very well drive AMD stock in 2017.From CEO Lisa Su:""As we enter 2017, we are well  positioned and on-track to deliver our strongest set of high-performance computing and graphics products in more than a decade.""So, should bulls exercise any caution?Well, AMD stock has already staged an amazing rally, and yes, we probably won't see a repeat of 2016's triple-digit gains.After all, Advanced Micro Devices' market cap is now close to $10 billion. Thus, it would need to generate a hefty $450 million in net earnings to get at a 25X multiple. But Wall Street frankly might not care.AMD stock has become an excellent momentum play. Shares have become a way to play some of the hottest markets in technology, including augmented reality and artificial intelligence.Apple Inc.

3 ETFs For True Total Market Coverage;January 31, 2017, 01:14:06 PM EDT;"ETF investors often spend an inordinate amount of time trying to find the best spot in the market.  They love focusing on specific sectors, factors, or tactical strategies that are showing a promising edge.  However, there is often a fundamental need for simple and diversified stock exposure at the lowest possible cost.This type of core foundation is the essence behind total stock market funds.  They allow you to stay correlated with the broadest possible indexes and charge expenses that are so fractional as to be almost non-existent.  They embody the true spirit of the ETF philosophy in their liquidity, tax efficiency, and transparency.The largest and most well-known of this group is theVanguard Total Stock Market ETF(VTI).  Over the years, Ive lost track of how many awards and commendations this fund has received.  Its true value proposition is the simplicity of a single vehicle for complete U.S. stock market coverage with the lowest possible tracking error.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');VTI owns a basket of 3,592 publicly traded securities across the large, mid, and small-cap verticals.  You cant get much more diversified than that.  The fund is market-cap weighted to give the largest stocks a greater share of its $70 billion asset base.  Nevertheless, the top holding,Apple Inc(AAPL) only accounts for 2.5% of the total portfolio.  That leaves a large swath of exposure to be distributed through the thousands of remaining holdings.One of the highly touted advantages of VTI is its ultra-low expense ratio of 0.05%.  Thats just $50 for every $100,000 invested on an annual basis.  The minimal expenses ensure this fund is appropriate as a long-term position in virtually any type of equity portfolio.The next largest fund by size is theSchwab US Broad Market ETF(SCHB), which has $7.7 billion under management.  This ETF tracks a basket of 2,000 stocks domiciled in the U.S. through all market-cap segments.SCHB claims one of the lowest industry expense ratios at just 0.03% annually.  This fee has been incrementally lowered multiple times over the years, which adds to its attractiveness for long-term investors.  Its even conceivable that one day this ETF will charge as low as one basis point per year for access to its diversified stock portfolio.Last, but certainly not least, is theiShares Core S&P Total U.S. Stock Market ETF(ITOT).  This fund shares traits of both VTI and SCHB in its overall makeup.  It charges an expense ratio of 0.03% and contains more than 3,600 underlying holdings.  ITOT has $6.7 billion in assets under management and has been in place since 2004.While all three of these funds have minor differences in their structure, they must ultimately be judged on their results. The 5-year price chart below shows that the returns for all three are almost indistinguishable from each other.That level of correlation is a dependable statistic for those that are agonizing over which is the best fund to pick.  There really is no wrong answer here.  Although, the decision may be made easier if one of these options is available transaction-free from your brokerage platform.  That would truly minimize total costs and allow you to scale in or out of any shares with the lowest possible friction.The Bottom LineTotal market ETFs are solid tools for both experienced investors and those who are just starting out on this journey.  They provide a truly simple path to a diversified stock allocation without having to agonize over various investment styles.  Removing complexity from the equation can result in better execution and a much greater chance for long-term success.Disclosure: At the time this article was written, the author owned shares of ITOT."

Intel Corporation Gets an Apple Inc. iPhone 7 Boost;January 31, 2017, 12:23:00 PM EDT;"Finally, microprocessor giantIntel(NASDAQ: INTC) has managed to achieve a real degree of success in   the market for chips that go into smartphones. A while back, it   was revealed thatApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) had chosen to use Intel as a second source for the   LTE modems that power its iPhone.Apple's iPhone SE. Image source: Apple.makeArticleAd();Now, while some investors may have worried that Intel might be   ""giving away"" these cellular modems -- in a move similar to what   the company did with its Bay Trail tablet processors (i.e.   providing platform cost offsets valued more than the selling   prices of the chips) -- the company's most recent financial   results show that this is very clearly not the case.The big modem boostIntel's modem sales fall under its Client Computing Group   (CCG), which derives the bulk of its revenue from sales of   processors and other components that go into personal   computers. When Intel reports financial results for CCG, it   gives investors two numbers to chew on: platform revenue and   ""other"" revenue. Platform revenue is made up of processor and   accompanying chipset (also known as a PCH) sales, while ""other""   revenue refers to a smorgasbord of other complementary   technologies, including cellular modems.We can see that Intel is seeing a very large boost in cellular   modem sales because Intel's revenue from ""other"" went from $356   million in the fourth quarter of 2015 -- when Intel sold   precisely zero modems to Apple -- to $773 million in the fourth   quarter of 2016 -- when Intel is known to be selling modems to   Apple.Of course, it's likely that not all of that increase is due to   the ramp up in cellular modem shipments -- Intel did take the   time to highlight that it enjoyed record Wi-Fi chip shipments   last quarter -- but there's really nothing else that can explain   the substantial majority of that increase.What does this revenue increase tell us?The bad news is that we can't deduce too much about the   profitability of these modems solely from these results -- though   Intel did indicate later in the call that cellular modem   shipments during 2017 would serve as a headwind to the company's   gross profit margins. So we know that the modems are sold at   lower than corporate average margins.What we can deduce is this, however: Intel isn't providing   excessive ""contra-revenue"" payments to get these modems into the   iPhone because Intel is generating positive revenue -- and   significant revenue at that -- from its modems. (Although we   already knew this because Intel would almost have certainly   disclosed to investors in advance that a ramp of its modem   shipments would detract from operating profit.) If that were the   case, some investors may have wanted to see the financial   evidence before believing it.Looking aheadIf we assume that Intel is going to continue to supply Apple   with modems beyond the iPhone 7 -- and the odds of this look good   -- then there are some interesting financial   implications. First, Intel's share at Apple may be set to   grow in the coming product cycle. Right now, Intel is in some   portion of the iPhone 7 models, but is completely absent from the   iPhone SE, iPhone 6s, or iPhone 6s.Once Apple releases new models and waterfalls the iPhone 7 and   iPhone 7 Plus to serve as its mid-range offerings -- and if we   assume that Intel and Qualcomm get roughly equivalent order   allocations during the next iPhone cycle to what we're seeing   with the iPhone 7 series -- then Intel's share will necessarily   go up. I also wouldn't be surprised to see Intel inside of a   future iPhone SE, as well.It's reasonable to expect that Intel will see some nice   year-over-year growth in the ""other"" portion of CCG over the   course of 2017, with acceleration happening in the second half of   the year, due to the launch of the new iPhone models.10 stocks we like better than Wal-MartWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock     tip, it can pay to listen.

Is Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Resurrecting the Cursed Windows RT?;January 31, 2017, 12:10:33 PM EDT;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsDon't look now, butMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) looks to be taking another run atAlphabet Inc's(NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) Chrome operating system. References have begun popping up in builds of the Windows 10 Creators Update (which is due to arrive in April) to Windows 10 Cloud.makeArticleAd();Source: MicrosoftSpeculation is growing that Windows 10 Cloud is in fact a new simplified version of Microsoft's operating system, designed to run on devices powered by inexpensive ARM chips fromARM Holdings plc (ADR)(NASDAQ:ARMH).In other words, it appears that Microsoft is preparing to take on the threat of Chromebooks - the cheap, popular laptops running Google's Chrome OS. And it seems to be doing so by resurrecting the idea of Windows RT.Windows 10 CloudWindows 10 Creators Build is the next major revision of the Microsoft Windows PC operating system. It's due to begin rolling out to users around April 17.The 5 Best Stocks to Buy for Big Emerging Markets ProfitsBut developers have been testing pre-release builds of Microsoft's software and recently some of them began to notice something strange: The code references different variations of the operating system. For example, Windows 10 Pro for Workstation and Windows 10 for Enterprise are spiked out. Nothing unusual there. But then, references to Windows 10 Cloud began to appear. And that started raising eyebrows - what is Windows 10 Cloud?ZDNet'sMary Jo Foley put the pieces together yesterday. Quoting unnamed sources, she says that the mysterious Windows 10 Cloud is a new, simplified version of Microsoft Windows that will run only Unified Windows Platform (UWP) apps. In other words, it's a""simpler, safer, cheaper"" version of Windows 10.You might also think of it as another crack at Windows RT Windows RT? But Why?Everyone remembers the mess that wasWindows RT. The attempt to shoehorn a version of Windows onto a consumer tablet running ARM chips -the ill-fated Surface RT - very nearly dealt MSFT's tablet aspirations a fatal blow.However, despite the failure of Windows RT, Microsoft has never given up on the idea of Windows on ARM chips. By doing so, it can get Windows onto mobile devices that can't use the more powerful and expensive chips fromIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC). The company has already been showing offWindows 10 running in emulation on high-end ARM chips. As part of that effort, it could also be working on a ""lite"" version that can deliver much of the Windows 10 experience on less expensive, lower powered ARM hardware.So why, why,whywould Microsoft risk falling flat on its face again with what essentially amounts to another crack at Windows RT? There are two reasons.The first is that dream of ""Windows everywhere."" Having the full Windows 10 experience on high-powered ARM chips is great, but only flagship smartphones and tablets can afford to use those chips. Windows 10 Cloud would get Microsoft Windows (and Bing) onto a whole lot more mobile hardware.The second is Google's Chrome OS and Chromebooks. These cheap laptops have been under Microsoft's skin for years. They've become extremely popular in the education sector thanks to low cost, ease of use and built-in security. And Chromebooks have just kept selling, to the point where last year they passed evenApple Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AAPL)MacBooks in sales.Microsoft has tried fighting back by helping manufacturers put out cheap Windows 10 laptops, but that hasn't stemmed the Chromebook flood. Windows 10 makes for a sluggish experience on inexpensive Intel hardware, it's far more complex than Chrome OS to use and lacks the drop-dead easy security of Chromebooks.Cash Out of Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Before EarningsWindows 10 Cloud running on laptops with ARM processors would compete head-to-head with Chromebooks running Chrome OS: simpler, safer and cheaper than Windows 10.Microsoft refused to comment on theZDNetpost, but the pieces pointing to Windows 10 as a Chrome OS-fighting, second crack at Windows RT make sense. Naturally, MSFT is going to avoid all references to Windows RT - that's poison - and the Windows 10 Cloud name could end up being a code name.It could also be an attempt to steal some of the Chrome OS ""cloud"" thunder. Expect to get the final answer on Windows 10 Cloud from Microsoft prior to that April 17 Windows 10 Creators Build release.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace3 ""Golden"" Ammo Stocks to Buy for Big 2017 Returns3 Stocks to Buy for Better Deals Than the Great RecessionThe postIs Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Resurrecting the Cursed Windows RT?appeared first onInvestorPlace."

Intel Corporation's Personal-Computer Business Beats Expectations;January 31, 2017, 10:32:00 AM EDT;"On Jan. 26, microprocessor giantIntel(NASDAQ: INTC) announced its financial results for the fourth   quarter of 2016 and, by extension, the entirety of 2016.A rendering of an Intel seventh-generation Core processor.     Image source: Intel.makeArticleAd();The company had previously guided to $15.7 billion in revenue   for the quarter and gross profit margin of 61%, representing   sequential declines from $15.8 billion and 63.3%,   respectively.Intel's actual financial results were much more impressive;   the company reported $16.4 billion in revenue for the quarter and   a gross profit margin percentage of 61.7%, up from $14.9 billion   and down from 64.3% in the prior year, respectively.For the full year, Intel raked in $59.4 billion at 60.9% gross   profit margin -- a little above the midpoint of its long-term   gross margin range of 55% to 65%, though down 170 basis points   year over year.This upside appears to have been driven, ironically enough, by   the company's Client Computing Group (CCG) business, which   derives the bulk of its revenues from sales of components into   personal computers, generally viewed as a declining market.Let's take a closer look at the company's revenue and profit   performance in this segment.Solid improvements in revenue and     profitabilityIntel reported that total CCG revenue hit $9.13 billion in the   most recent quarter, up from $8.76 billion in the same quarter a   year-ago -- a respectable 4% year-over-year boost.Operating income vastly outpaced revenue, though, with this   figure growing from $2.72 billion in the year-ago quarter to   $3.52 billion in the most recent quarter -- up almost 30% year   over year. Management attributed this to lower operating   expenses, a ""richer product mix,"" and improved product margins as   14-nanometer chip manufacturing yields improved. The same story   has been playing out all year in CCG.Now, it's worth noting that Intel reported that the ""platform""   portion of its CCG revenue, which consists of sales of processors   and chipsets, were roughly flat, at $8.36 billion in the prior   year compared with $8.4 billion in the most recent quarter. But   its ""other"" segment -- which includes complementary products,   such as wireless chips -- saw revenues more than double to $773   million, from $356 million a year-ago.It is likely that this large boost in ""other"" revenue within   CCG was due primarily to the ramp-up of the company's XMM 7360   cellular modem in theApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus devices.Good full-year resultsFor the full year, Intel reported that CCG revenue was up 2%,   while expectations going into the year were for a decline, with   operating profit up a smidgen more than 30%. Platform revenue was   roughly flat, at $30.75 billion versus $30.68 billion, with   ""other"" revenue surging from $1.54 billion in 2015 to $2.16   billion in 2016.The iPhone win clearly contributed to a large part of the   ""other"" segment growth here, but the driver of the increased   platform revenue is a little bit subtler.Indeed, Intel reported that shipments of its notebook computer   processors declined by 1% year over year and that shipments of   its desktop computer processors dropped by 6%. Key to keeping   platform revenues flat was a 2% increase in notebook platform   average selling prices, as well as a 2% increase in desktop   platform average selling prices.What's happening, then, is that computer makers are selling   fewer computers than they were before, as evidenced by the   notebook and desktop platform unit shipment drops, but the   computers that they do sell, on average, contain more expensive   processors.10 stocks we like better than IntelWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for   over a decade,Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has tripled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy right now... and Intel wasn't one of them!

5 Reasons I Don't Buy MeetMe's Growth Story;January 31, 2017, 10:15:00 AM EDT;"Last December, I highlightedMeetMe(NASDAQ: MEET) as apotentially undervaluedgrowth play in a frothy market. The social networking app maker   posted eye-popping numbers last quarter -- 32% annual growth in   monthly active users (MAUs), 20% growth in total revenues, and   30% non-GAAP earnings growth.Analysts expect MeetMe's revenue and non-GAAP earnings to   respectively rise 38% and 16% next year. Yet the stock trades at   just 7 times trailing earnings and 10 times forward earnings.   Let's take a look at the five key reasons investors aren't buying   MeetMe's growth story, despite its high growth figures and low   valuations.MeetMe's mobile app. Image source: Google Play.makeArticleAd();1. A troubling history with sexual predatorsMeetMe lets users find new people in their area to chat with,   similar toMatch's(NASDAQ: MTCH) Tinder. While there's nothing inherently   sinister about the app, there have been multiple reports of   MeetMe being used by sexual predators.In 2014, the City of San Francisco sued MeetMe for the   unlawful publication of minors' profiles, photos, and geolocation   data, and claimed that  the app ""enabled"" sexual predators   to find their victims. The city cited several cases involving   adult men and minors in which MeetMe was used. MeetMe settled the   case for $200,000 the  following year, agreeing to clarify   and simplify its user agreements and settings, and reducing the   amount of data displayed on minors to their city and state.But the cases involving MeetMe didn't cease -- last February,   a Buffalo man was  charged with multiple counts of child   pornography after using MeetMe to find minors. MeetMe's troubles   raised red flags at Tinder, which hiked its age limit from 13 to   18 last June. Yet MeetMe still hasn't followed suit, presumably   because it would lose a large portion of its users.2. The potential loss of ad revenuesYou'd think that big companies would be reluctant to advertise   on MeetMe, but plenty of big brands still advertise on the app.   That's because MeetMe generates most of its ad revenues from   programmatic ads delivered byTwitter's(NYSE:TWTR) MoPub.This means that MoPub's customers simply pick a demographic --   in MeetMe's case, younger users and Millennials -- and the   platform feeds the ads to various apps. This means that many   companies probably don't realize that their ads are appearing on   MeetMe.Therefore, a common bear thesis is that MoPub could decide to   drop MeetMe due to violations of its terms of service, or   advertisers could ask MoPub to pull their ads from the   controversial app. There's no evidence either of these scenarios   will occur, but it raises a troubling question -- if MeetMe's   reputation worsens, can it still keep growing its ad   revenues?3. Being booted from the app storesIn its 10-K filing for fiscal 2015, MeetMe admits  that   its business will suffer if it is ""unable to maintain a good   relationship"" withAppleandAlphabet's Google. It notes that its app could be pulled from their app   stores ""if we violate"" or the companies believe ""that we have   violated"" their terms and conditions.The bulls might believe that's just a typical ""risk factor""   warning, but MeetMe admits in the same filing that ""on more than   one occasion,"" Apple rejected its app ""because of user generated   content and other concerns."" This indicates that another   high-profile lawsuit could knock MeetMe out of the app stores and   kill its business.4. Tinder is crushing MeetMeMeetMe arrived before Tinder, which was initially launched in   2012. But over the past five years, mainstream interest in MeetMe   waned in correlation with Tinder's growth, as seen in this chart   from Google Trends:Image source: Google.That decline also explains why MeetMe acquired its competitor   Skout last  October. That move boosted the company's MAU   count from about 5 million to  8.5 million, and greatly   inflated MeetMe's top and bottom line growth for fiscal 2016.5. The lack of insider confidenceIf MeetMe is as undervalued as the fundamentals suggest, you'd   expect insiders to be loading up on shares. However, MeetMe CEO   Geoffrey Cook just  sold 250,000 shares (16% of his entire   position) at an average price of $5.02.Including Cook's sales, insiders sold  1.96 million   shares over the past 12 months, but only bought 334,000 shares.   It's understandable that MeetMe's insiders would sell after the   stock's 50% rally over the past 12 months, but it also indicates   that its upside potential could be limited.The key takeawayThe main lesson here is to always look beyond the valuations   and growth forecasts. On the surface, MeetMe looks like a rapidly   growing social app maker trading at a discount to its peers. But   dig deeper, and you'll see an app that's struggling to prove that   it's not a tool for criminals while remaining relevant against   Tinder, which dominates the space with  over 50 million   active users.10 stocks we like better than MeetMeWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Trade War Concerns Coming Home to Roost;January 31, 2017, 10:02:00 AM EDT;"Tuesday, January 31, 2017makeArticleAd();We'd gone more than two months on a Trump Rally that had favorably priced in things like corporate tax cuts and deregulation, opening a clear path toward market gains. Eventually we saw a bid up to the coveted Dow 20,000 - something that had been considered a pipe dream so soon by a plurality of analysts.This morning, however, based on a CNBC survey among economists, protectionist policies of the Trump administration are considered the biggest threat to the U.S. economy. A border adjustment tax is receiving a 45% negative rating from the analysts surveyed - especially regarding two of America's biggest trading partners, China and Mexico - as a trade war scenario begins to emerge.Especially now that we have seen aggressive actions from the nascent administration that, if transferred to candidate Trump's promises on trade, look to radicalize the status quo. This is something the markets had not priced in, but are beginning to do so. Dow 20,000 is now in the rearview mirror - down another 43 points from closing yesterday below the psychologically pleasing 20K round number.Q4 earnings results have also taken a down-turn ahead of the opening bell today: ExxonMobilXOM, Under ArmourUAAand PfizerPFEall reported disappointing results on the bottom line this morning. Under Armour in particular has been hard hit in the pre-market, down initially 28% (now around 24%) on the news, which also included a report that its CFO will be stepping down.After the bell today we'll see AppleAAPLreport earnings results. Estimates of $3.22 per share on $76.2 billion represent a mixed bag from the year-ago quarter, down 6 cents per share but narrowly above Q1 2016 sales totals. The stock is up more than 9% since the Trump Rally began, outperforming the S&P 500 overall.Mark VickerySenior EditorClick here to follow this author>>Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Why Expedia Inc Will Profit From This Global Market Trend (EXPE);January 31, 2017, 10:00:01 AM EDT;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAs an analyst who spends every day looking at numbers, I have a tendency to try and quantify everything. We humans, as a species, tend to do this all the time.makeArticleAd();For the most part, it serves us well. But it can also sometimes be a trap, diminishing the value of what is simply unquantifiable.I learned this lesson a few years ago on a trip to the green highlands and snow-capped mountains of Peru.During the planning phase, I contemplated every detail of the trip, from number of hours spent on flights nights spent in hotels how many sites I could see within a certain amount of time. Everything had to be just perfect.But even during the early phases of the journey, I found myself countingThere were four grueling days of hiking. At about 20.5 miles in total length, it took four days to complete. Each night, we camped at about 13,000 feet. And at the summit of our hike, we would reach 14,928 feet.Strenuous hiking at such a high elevation for such an extended period of time meant that every breath, every step, was a laborious effort. But we pressed on, young and old, encouraged each other and offered a helping hand until we reached the end of our journey. And best of all, we knew that each painstaking step meant that we were just that closer to seeing one of the most truly remarkable sights in the world: the ancient Incan city of Machu Picchu.It was only during those little moments when I was able to move past this tendency to quantify everything that I truly lost myself in the mystery and wonder the world has to offer.Hopefully, you've had the chance to have experiences like this at some point in your life, too. All too often, we in the developed world tend to take for granted the fact that most of us have the means to do these kinds of things.7 Stocks to Buy That Could Double by 2018But there are hundreds of millions of people who don't - but they soon will.The World's Burgeoning Middle ClassGlobal demand for travel is surging. Hundreds of millions of people are entering the global middle class right now and in the years to come. One of the first things these people will look to do is travel.By 2030, two-thirds of the global middle class will be residents of the Asia-Pacific region. That's up from just under one-third in 2009. And China alone is expected to have a staggering one billion members of the middle class by then.China's budding middle class is already traveling in greater numbers than ever before. A United Nations tourism report showed that the number of Chinese citizens traveling overseas has surged from 10 million in 2000 to more than 83 million in 2013.This is a huge opportunity for the online travel business. Consumers in the Asia-Pacific region currently book only about 27% of their travels online, while Latin America lags even further at 21%. In China, only about 15% of consumers currently book their travel online. This is compared to rates over 50% in the United States and Europe.It's not hard to imagine that the rest of the world will quickly catch up to the United States and Europe in terms of booking their travel online. And that sets up a tremendous opportunity.That's where my colleague Jimmy Butts comes in with one of his most recent picks in his premium newsletter,Top Stock AdvisorHow To Profit From This TrendIn last month's issue of his newsletter, Jimmy reported on the incredible growth of the online travel market. Citing much of the information I referenced above, he went on to recommend two publicly-traded online travel companies.I don't like to make a habit of giving away too many picks from our premium publications, since our subscribers pay good money for this information (to learn how to subscribe,go here). But I can reveal that one of them isExpedia Inc(EXPE), the world's largest online travel company.Surging industry growth is reflected in Expedia's gross bookings. In 2015, the company booked a staggering $60 billion worth of flights, hotels, rental cars and cruises. It's on track to crush those figures in 2016, already racking up gross bookings of more than $56 billion through the first nine months of this year, which is 23% more compared with the first nine months of 2015.Expedia has made major strides in the international market. In 2005, international revenue made up only 22% of its portfolio; last year that soared to approximately 45%. But that's just the tip of the iceberg in terms of potential for growth. Despite being the largest player in online travel, the company still has only a 4% share of the global market.This speaks to the highly-fragmented nature of the market, but also for the potential to grow through acquisitions, which Expedia has been doing for some time now already. Between the growth in the global middle class and growth in the online travel market, Jimmy thinks Expedia should benefit greatly over the next 5-10 years.As such, it's a good long-term holding to consider adding to your portfolio.3 Things Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Owners Must Watch in Q1 EarningsJimmy's other pick, however, may have even more potential. I won't give away the name here (to get it, you'll have to subscribe toTop Stock Advisor.) But it has a hold on 50% of the online travel market in China - which by all accounts should be the prime growth market in in the years ahead.While the real value of travel may not be quantifiable, investors who back this company now could be counting sizeable gains within a few years.

Why Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM) Q4 Earnings Trump Reality;January 31, 2017, 09:51:23 AM EDT;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThere was an unusual amount of anticipation over the fourth-quarter earnings release ofExxon Mobil Corporation(NYSE:XOM). After all its CEO, Rex Tillerson, was recently plucked from the boardroom and made U.S. Secretary of State. There is hope that oil and gas prices may stay over $50 per barrel and, if so, Exxon stock should be making big money.makeArticleAd();Source:Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified)But it's not  at least not yet. XOM's numbers, $1.7 billion in net income and 41 cents per share, badly trailed analyst estimates of 68 cents. But the top-line, $61 billion in revenue, was about a half-billion above those estimates.For the year, the company earned $7.84 billion, $1.88 per share. This sounds impressive, but it's less than half of 2015's $16.15 billion in earnings, and that in turn was half of 2014's $32.52 billion. The initial response of traders was cautious, with Exxon stock opening only slightly below the previous day's close of $84.86 per share.The question for XOM stock investors remains, is this the bottom, and how quick might the turn be?Exxon Stock Is Hanging In ThereThe year 2016 was a year that XOM stock had to hang in and tough things out. The earnings release emphasized that cash flow and asset sales covered the dividend of 75 cents per share. The dividend costs the company about $3 billion per quarter, and the quarterly earnings continue to come up short of that mark.10 Stocks to Buy That Already Make America GreatThe company has kept earnings positive by cutting back sharply on capital expenditures. It spent $4.83 billion during the fourth quarter, against $7.42 billion a year earlier. For the year, Exxon invested $19.30 billion, against $31.05 billion in 2015.This has yet to have a big impact on production, which was down just 3%, or 127,000 barrels per day, from 2015's figures during the fourth quarter, with new volume in Nigeria and Indonesia partly making up for the declining production of U.S. fields. The company lost $2.3 billion producing oil, which it calls ""upstream"" operations, and $1.2 billion refining and selling it, which it calls ""downstream"" operations. The profit came from chemicals, $872 million, and finance earnings of $209 million.XOM Stock: Swing and a MissInitial reporting on the release emphasized the earnings miss.CNBC said the numbers""badly"" missedestimates on earnings, and Marketwatch just used the word""miss.""The Nasdaq.com headline emphasized that earnings fell 40%from a year earlier.However, writers hedged their stories by noting the strength of Exxon stock and pointing out that the shares were already down nearly 6% for 2017, and after an initial fall of a few cents, XOM stock quickly found its footing in pre-market trading, getting above $85 per share. The yield remains fat at 3.5%, so the downside for Exxon stock will be muted.Better Times Ahead for XOM?It's anticipation of bigger things that keeps Exxon stock players coming back. InvestorPlace Feature Writer James Brumley holds out great hope for a deal, whichtook the Bass family prospects in the Permian Basin back into the fold.XOM stock investors expected an update on Texas productionat the company's earnings conference call.3 Things Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Owners Must Watch in Q1 EarningsDespite the recent fall in the Exxon stock price, the 320-day moving averagehas been rising for over two monthswith speculators saying it needed to hold $84.55 to maintain the up-trend. That seemed likely.Analysts continue to hold their breath on XOM stock, with half now sitting in the ""hold"" camp, one having recently switched off ""strong buy"" and one having switched off ""strong sell.""The bottom line for Exxon stock is that, if Trump is as good for oil as advertised, the company should be seeing that in results as 2017 unfolds. Or that could be a pie-crust promise - easily made, easily broken.Dana Blankenhornis a financial and technology journalist.

Alphabet Employees Protest Against Trump's Immigration Ban;January 31, 2017, 09:49:00 AM EDT;"Protests against Donald Trump's anti-immigration policy are gaining steam and the technology sector appears to be leading the way.  More than 2000Alphabet Inc.'sGOOGLGoogle employees staged protests against Trump's immigration ban by walking out of eight offices worldwide including the company's headquarters in Mountain View on Monday. Photos and videos of the walkouts have been tweeted using hashtag #GooglersUnite.Google co-founder Sergey Brin and CEO Sundar Pichai have extended their full support to the opposition.Concurrent with the protest, Google created a $4 million fund to support immigrant rights groups like the Immigrant Legal Resource Center, the American Civil Liberties Union, the U.N. Refugee Agency and the International Rescue Committee.The protest was particularly against Trump's executive order to ban nationals of seven Muslim majority countries - Iraq, Iran, Somalia, Libya, Syria, Sudan and Yemen - from coming to the U.S. Pichai denounced the order and stated that the ban affects about 187 Google employees.We note that not quite long ago, Trump had called up technology leaders and urged them to create and retain jobs within the U.S. to which most of them had given their nods. However as the immigration ban order rolled out, the sector is sending clear indications that it will not create jobs at the cost of preventing entry to external talent.Alphabet Inc.

3 Questions for Apple, Inc. CEO Tim Cook Today;January 31, 2017, 09:06:00 AM EDT;"After the market closes today,Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) will report results for its first fiscal quarter   of 2017. Ending Dec. 31, the quarter includes the important   holiday period, raising the stakes for the company's performance.   Thanks to seasonality and the timing of Apple's latest iPhone   launch, the quarter is expected to include record-high   revenue.Apple CEO Tim Cook. Image source: Apple.makeArticleAd();While Apple's earnings release will give investors a useful   window into the company's financial performance, the tech giant's   earnings call will likely provide investors with some useful   nuggets, too. Ahead the earnings call, which will take place   shortly after Apple releases its financial results for the   quarter, here are three topics Apple CEO Tim Cook will hopefully   address.1. How confident is management in its product pipeline?Recently, Apple's iPhone business has not only leveled off,   but it has also been in decline. In Apple's fourth fiscal quarter   of 2016, for instance, iPhone revenue and unit sales were down   13% and 5% year over year, respectively. While some investors may   be hoping the iPhone can return to growth in Apple's first   quarter, investors -- or Apple -- shouldn't count on the iPhone   to be a major growth driver for the company in the future.Since iPhone accounts for about 60% of Apple's total sales,   the segment's headwinds make the health of the tech giant's   product pipeline more important than ever. Of course, given the   company's tendency to keep things secret, investors shouldn't   expect to get any specific information on new products from Cook   during Apple's earnings call, but investors can still look for   the CEO to talk about his level of confidence in the company's   upcoming products.2. What could Apple's services revenue growth look like in   2017?As Apple's iPhone, iPad, Mac, and other products segments   turning to year-over-year revenue declines recently, the   company's services segment, which includes sales from iTunes,   Apple Music, the App Store, iCloud, Apple Pay, licensing, and   other services, has continued to grow nicely. In Apple's most   recent quarter, services revenue increased 24% year over   year.During Apple's earnings call, investors should look to see if   Cook discusses how the company expects this segment to fair in   2017 and beyond. This question could come in many forms,   including:Does Apple expect Apple Music to evolve into a significant     driver for the company?Is growth for Apple Pay accelerating? Or has it leveled     off?Are there new services Apple could launch to continue     building out its services ecosystem?How significant of a role does Apple expect services to     play in the long-term?3. If there's a tax break for repatriation, does Apple plan   to take advantage of it?Considering President Donald Trump's plan to offer a one-off   tax holiday for U.S. companies to repatriate their overseas funds   at a lower tax rate, investors are interested in whether Apple   plans to take part in such a tax break, and, if it does, to what   extent.Image source: Getty Images.Of Apple's enormous $238 billion cash hoard reported in the   company's fourth quarter, a whopping $216 billion is held outside   of the Unite States. If Apple has aggressive plans for taking   advantage of this tax break, the company could significantly   increase its dividend, boost its share repurchase program, pay   out a special dividend, or even do all three.Investors can listen online to Apple's live conference call,   which can be found on the company's investor relations website,   on Tuesday, Jan. 31, at 2:00 p.m. PT.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Apple (AAPL) Earnings on Tap: iPhone, AirPods, App Store on Display;January 31, 2017, 08:31:30 AM EDT;"Apple iPhone (Shutterstock photo)Apple (AAPL) is set to report first quarter fiscal 2017 earnings results after the closing bell Tuesday. The Cupertino-based tech giant, which has beaten Wall Street earnings per share estimates in two straight quarters, is expected to break its streak of declining revenue at three. And the revenue increase will be driven by the barrage of new products Apple launched in the past three months.Notably, Apples iPhone 7 and 7 Plus devices. Beyond the new line of MacBooks and iPads, analysts may get a glimpse of the degree of demand Apple enjoyed for its wireless AirPods, of which CEO Tim Cook in December hinted that Apple couldnt make them fast enough. Investors are also eager to learn how well Apples services business has performed.makeArticleAd();Apple earlier this month disclosed its App Storeexperienced a 40% year-over-year surgein revenue in 2016. Apple says on New Year's day alone, customers spent nearly $240 million on apps and in-app purchases, marking the App Store's largest single-day of sales ever. For that matter, the App Store in December logged its highest-grossing month in its history, generating some $3 billion in revenue. How much of that total trickled to the bottom line during the quarter remains to be seen.The company also said it posted a 74% surge in billings from subscription services like Netflix (NFLX), popular dating app Tinder and Time Warner's (TWX) HBO Now, reaching to $2.7 billion.Why is all of this important? Apple has increasingly emphasized the cash flow generated from its Services segment. The Services business, which includes the App Store, revenues from Apple Pay and Apple Music, rose 24% in the fourth quarter, posting revenue of $6.3 billion. This was preceded by a 19% rise in the third quarter.In other words, Apple realizes it can not live by iPhones alone. Can it maintain the uptrend? On Tuesday analysts will scrutinize just how much closer Apple is to that reality. But for now, the iPhone remains Apples cash cow. And, beyond the headline earnings and revenue numbers, thats where the focus will be. Despite fears about longer upgrade cycles, increased competition and slow growth in emerging markets, analysts are generally positive about the recantation the iPhone 7 has received.In the three months that ended December, analysts expect Apple to report earnings per share of $3.23, down from $3.28 in the year-earlier on revenue of revenue of $77.4 billion. This compares to Apple's guidance range of $76 billion to $78 billion when it last reported earnings in October. Analysts expect Apple to have sold 78 million iPhones, which would be a 4% rise from the 75 million sold a year ago.Average selling prices, meanwhile, are projected to be $687 per unit, down $735 a year ago. However, thanks to prospect of higher shipments, iPhone revenues are expected to rise 3% to $53.1 billion. Meanwhile, data compiled by FactSet suggests Services revenue will reach $6.9 billion, up 13% year over year. To the extent Apple can beat on both the top and bottom lines, exceeds iPhone unit salesandprovide confident guidance, Apple stock should continue to climb.Apple shares, which have a consensus Buy rating and $135 price target, closed Monday at $121.68, down 0.22%. The shares have risen 5.06% year to date, compared with a 1.83% rise in the S&P 500 Index."

15 Best Short-Term Stock Investments;January 31, 2017, 08:17:07 AM EDT;"As any stock trader can tell you, the market can be volatile. That's why investment professionals typically recommend investors take a long-term approach to investing to reduce the risk of losing principal. If you invest at the wrong time, you could lose a significant amount of your money overnight, so keep in mind that stocks are not always the best short-term investments.That said, stock prices work both ways. A prudent  or lucky  investor could make a great deal of money just as rapidly as he could lose it. If you have a tolerance for risk and are willing to do the research, short-term trading might be a solution for at least part of your portfolio.If you decide to go this route, don't hesitate to contact a financial professional if you need assistance. Most important, if you're looking for stocks to buy now, do your homework to find good ones in which to invest. You can begin here with this list of 15 stocks to buy that might be thebest short-term investments for your portfolio.makeArticleAd();1. Apple:AAPLApple is one of the best-known companies in America, thanks in no small part to the iPhone. It's also the largest U.S. company in terms of market capitalization  the value of a company that's traded on the stock market  a number you can calculate by multiplying a company's stock price by the number of its outstanding shares. In the case of Apple, this number topped $618 billion as of late December 2016, coming in ahead of competitors Alphabet at $548 billion, Microsoft at $494.6 billion, Amazon at $366 billion and Facebook at $343.1 billion.Apple stock is positioned to move even higher in 2017. The company is aggressively buying back stock, which reduces the number of outstanding shares and increases earnings per share. Its latest iPhones, the 7 and 7 Plus, are the best-selling phones in its history. Apple also holds roughly $200 billion in overseas cash, which might move home this year if corporate taxes on repatriation are lowered. To top it all off, the stock is trading at just about 10 times earnings.2. Gilead Sciences:GILDIf you're looking for a short-term stock that had a rough go of it in 2016, Gilead Sciences might be your pick. The biotechnology company's sales of its hepatitis C drug declined and the stock fell 29 percent in 2016.Gilead could turn out to be one of the best stocks for 2017, however. The company trades at the compelling valuation of 6.99 times estimated earnings over the next year. It's bought back 14 percent of its stock over the past three years, and with its $32 billion cash hoard, the company might continue to buy more or make strategic acquisitions. Gilead also uses its cash to pay out a 2.5 percent dividend to shareholders. The stock could very well hit $101 in 2017, according to analysts at JP Morgan.3. Alphabet:GOOGAlphabet, formerly known as Google, is one of the world's great businesses, according to Barron's. The company owns numerous products and services including Google Maps and Google Play, YouTube, Nest, Chrome, Android, and Gmail. Analysts project 2017 revenues for the company in excess of $103 billion, which would represent a growth rate of more than 18 percent.Given the current political climate, Alphabet might see a short-term boost in the form of repatriated cash. The company currently holds about $80 billion in cash overseas, which translates to around $115 per share. Additionally, it has a lot of room for cost cutting because it spends freely on noncore businesses. Some analysts are estimating $41 per share in earnings this year, which would be huge since the company currently trades at just 18 times earnings.4. Facebook:FBEven if you don't use Facebook at home or on your smartphone, it's hard to avoid its presence in store windows or on advertising asking you to ""like"" something. The key to Facebook's financial success is its monetization of its enormous customer base. It has 1.79 billion monthly active users  and that number continues to rise. Lately, Facebook's stock price has gone up and exceeded analyst earnings estimates by an average of 21.11 percent.Facebook is still investing in ways to grow its earnings even more, with mobile ads and video revenues currently doing the heavy lifting. The company is also expecting big things out of its virtual reality investments. With a long-term growth rate of 27.6 percent, the company is expected to continue its rise.5. Citigroup:CCitigroup could benefit from a number of factors in 2017, including rising interest rates. TheFederal Reserve raised interest ratesfor just the second time in a decade in 2016. The Fed indicated that it expects to hike rates an additional three times in 2017. In response, the two-year Treasury note hit its highest rate since 2009. When interest rates rise, banks can charge more money on loans and credit cards, potentially increasing their profitability.Citigroup's stock has lagged compared with its peers' so far in 2017, which gives it room to catch up. The stock trades at just about 11 times its expected earnings for next year  and it trades at the widest discount-to-book value of the major banks. This means the stock is discounted more than 25 percent compared with the price-earnings ratios of its peers, making it a possible value play.6. IBM:IBMIBM is another turnaround candidate for 2017. The company used to dominate the computer hardware and services business sector but has been surpassed in recent years by its competitors. However, its slow turn toward the more modern businesses of artificial intelligence, cloud computing, mobility and security is showing signs of bearing fruit.The company spent more than $5 billion in acquisitions in 2016 alone, and its new product lines now account for more than 40 percent of firm revenues. Its analytics division showed revenue growth of 16 percent, and its cloud business jumped by 42 percent  both hopeful signs for future growth. IBM's artificial intelligence business has generated positive buzz thanks to its Watson cognitive system, which is known for beating two human ""Jeopardy!"" contestants. The stock trades at a 12.19 price-earnings ratio based on expected 2017 earnings.7. Norwegian Cruise Line:NCLHNorwegian Cruise Line is poised to benefit from the rapidly growing cruise segment and could be one of the best stocks to buy now. With the core demographic of aging baby boomers on the rise, cruise lines are a growing market. The company doesn't pay dividends to shareholders but reinvests its cash flow into building more ships and expanding its routes. Norwegian has already won approval to sail to Cuba, and it has repositioned its calendar to deploy ships into the fast-growing Asian market for the first time in 15 years.Norwegian boasts the newest fleet among its major North American competitors, making it attractive to customers looking for the latest and greatest offerings. The company owns a diversified portfolio of maritime brands including Oceania and Regent Seven Seas. Analysts estimate the stock will grow earnings by more than 18 percent in 2017  the stock trades at just 14 times 2017 estimates.8. Amazon:AMZNAmazon has grown from an online bookseller to the eighth-largest retailer in the world, and it hasn't shown any signs of slowing down. Amazon will become the largest apparel seller in the U.S. by 2021, when it will be selling $62 billion in apparel annually  more than TJ Maxx and Macy's combined  according to analysts at Cowen Group.Amazon is firing on multiple fronts: It's poised to capitalize on streaming media's popularity via its Amazon Prime subscription service. Additionally, its Web Services business is more advanced than competitors Microsoft and Alphabet's cloud offerings, thanks to it being first to market. Analysts at Evercore ISI Institutional Equities cite Amazon as the best internet stock for 2017. Excitement is also brewing over Amazon's latest foray into the grocery business, Amazon Go. In true disruptor fashion, Amazon's take on the grocery store is to use sensors rather than grocery clerks.9. Restoration Hardware:RHRestoration Hardware is a well-known, luxury home furnishings brand that suffered through 2016. Its earnings fell and triggered a stock sell-off in which shares lost more than half their value. However, the company has shown some signs of being a possible candidate for short-term traders. In its most recent quarter, revenue actually rose 3 percent and beat analysts' estimates by more than $20 million. Earnings also beat Wall Street expectations by 4 cents per share.In addition to rebounding sales and earnings, Restoration Hardware conducted an image makeover. Going forward, the company will be called simply ""RH."" Additionally, the company has launched a new, RH Modern line. In an attempt to capitalize on a more current type of revenue stream, RH is now offering annual memberships. As a result, analysts peg the company's five-year earnings growth rate at 20.33 percent, with earnings for the upcoming year jumping 61.27 percent.10. Toll Brothers:TOLToll Brothers is a leading luxury home builder, a business that's been hit hard on many fronts. Although risks remain, the fear of rising interest rates dampening homebuying activity has sent Toll Brothers stock to a bargain price. The company now trades at less than 10 times its anticipated 2017 earnings, which are expected by some to rise 20 percent.Some concerns over the luxury condo market in New York City also hang over the stock, but company reps indicate that earnings will hold up. With the stock seemingly priced for a worst-case scenario, its valuation of about 1.2 times book value is compelling. If housing markets hold firm or interest rates don't rise dramatically, Toll Brothers stock could prove surprising to those anticipating the worst.11. Deutsche Telekom:DTEGYDeutsche Telekom is a German stock that many investors might recognize as the former parent of U.S. T-Mobile. The company still owns a 65 percent stake in the independently traded T-Mobile  and that stock has been skyrocketing. Deutsche's core European telecom business trades at a discount compared with its peers  it fell by 13 percent in 2016  even though it's the leading wired and wireless operator in Germany. Sporting a nearly 4 percent yield, some analysts describe the stock as undervalued.A takeover play might happen in 2017: Comcast has had its eye on T-Mobile as a potential purchase. T-Mobile might also make another attempt to merge with Sprint, which could end up being a catalyst for Deutsche's stock. If everything falls into place, a share price of $20 isn't inconceivable.12. Sprouts Farmers Market:SFMSprouts Farmers Market flies under the radar of many investors because it's not really a headline-making stock. This lack of publicity might work to its advantage, however, as more investors become aware of its potential. Sprouts is drawing customers from the growing natural and organic food segment  and it prices its goods below that of its notable peer, Whole Foods Market. As a result, some analysts see the company generating mid-teens earnings and revenue growth in the foreseeable future.The company is growing out of its base in the American Southwest and moving east, growing 14 percent in square footage every year. Coupled with its favorable market segments, Sprouts is generating positive cash flow and returning cash to shareholders via a stock buyback program. At 20.5 times estimated 2017 earnings, the stock could be ready to move.13. Delta Air Lines:DALDelta Air Lines has greatly improved its financial performance but still trades at a typical airline multiple of about nine times estimated 2017 earnings. Since 2009, Delta has worked to cut its debt in half. As a result, it now has an investment grade rating from independent ratings service Moody's. To further entice shareholders, Delta pays a 1.7 percent dividend and has aggressively repurchased stock.Delta management feels the stock should be valued more like a diversified industrial company, which would dramatically raise its multiple, and, therefore, its share price. If you need another short-term catalyst, look at the company's free cash flow. Delta is a cash-flow machine  it generated $4.1 billion in cash flow in the last 12 months alone and put just 9.8 percent of that into dividend payments, according to Forbes.14. Novartis:NVTSAnother value play for 2017 could be Novartis, a Swiss diversified drug company and the world's biggest prescription drugmaker. The company's share price had a difficult 2016 but now trades at about 15 times next year's earnings. With a yield of about 3.75 percent, Novartis has an analyst consensus price target of $87, some $15 north of its current price.Part of what held Novartis back in 2016 was fear over the slow start of Entresto, its heart-failure drug, but some analysts think sales will soon accelerate and could go as high as $3 billion. Novartis also gets 25 percent of its sales from high-growth, emerging markets, which makes it less dependent on the more mature U.S. drug market. The company's recent purchase of Encore Vision should also shore up its vision sales and further enable it to diversify its holdings.15. General Motors:GMGeneral Motors has been an integral part of the global auto industry for more than 100 years and has recently faced headwinds. Some market participants feel that global auto sales have peaked, and concerns over themovement to electric vehicleshave held back GM stock. Whatever the reasons are, General Motors currently trades at a low price-to-earnings ratio of 4.3. Even industry competitors  like Ford, which trades at a ratio of 6.6, and Toyota, which trades at 9.7 times  trade at higher multiples, and GM's average price-earnings ratio over the past five years is 12.2.GM could move higher as the market appreciates its emerging electric and hybrid portfolio. Some analysts feel GM has the bankroll and technology to undersell rivals such as Tesla and perhaps even compete on quality at some point. GM stock began rallying at the end of 2016, which leads some analysts to predict it could double in price over the next one or two years.Data is accurate as of Jan. 25, 2017.

3 Things Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Owners Must Watch in Q1 Earnings;January 31, 2017, 07:00:34 AM EDT;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsEven ifApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) weren't the biggest company in the world (as measured by market cap), its quarterly earnings reports would still arguably be the most-watched reports for any given earnings seasons. Not only are a wide swath of many other companies linked to Apple's success, but AAPL stock itself is something of a barometer for the broad market.makeArticleAd();Source: AppleYet, the last few quarterly earnings announcements have also raised questions, not the least of which is whether or not iPhone-mania has run its course. The growth pace has been undeniably tapering off.That's going to be the hot button on Tuesday, after the close, when the Apple earnings report for its fiscal first quarter is due.Apple Earnings PreviewAs of the most recent look, Apple isexpected to post earnings of $3.22 per shareon revenue of $77.42 billion for the quarter ending in December. The company itself had guided for Q1 revenue of between $77 and $78 billion. That bottom line would be a tad lower than the $3.28 per share of AAPL stock reported for the same quarter a year earlier, though the top line would be up just a bit from the prior year's first fiscal quarter tally of $75.87 billion.Apple needs a strong showing on Tuesday. Although it has been a strong growth machine since unveiling the first iPhone a little over a decade ago, per-share profits have been lower on a year-over-year basis in each of the prior three quarters. Ditto for revenue.10 Stocks to Buy That Already Make America GreatAAPL stock investors have been patient thus far, giving CEO Tim Cook time to adjust to a maturing market. A shortfall and/or another quarter of shrinking numbers, however, may push those traders' patience over the edge.3 Things to Watch for AAPLNot that Apple doesn't have a myriad of things going on at any given time, but for the most part, investors tend to focus on what they perceive as the biggest three. The three items that will be doing most of the driving for AAPL stock after Tuesday's report are (in no particular order)iPhone 7 salesIt's the 800-pound gorilla in the room. Strong sales of the company's flagship device can cure all other ills, but if sales of the company's most recent iteration of the iPhone fall short, little else matters.Expectations are widely varied on this front too. Cowen & Co.thinks Apple sold 58.5 million units of the iPhone 7 last quarter, while Drexel Hamilton believes Applesold 76 million iPhones- not just the iPhone 7 - during its fiscal Q1. The overall consensus, though, isan average of 77.3 million units. Presumably most of those are the 7 and 7 Plus models.Apps and Digital ContentWhile Apple used to be a hardware company that also happened to facilitate the purchase of smartphone apps, music and video media, digital content is increasingly becomingan important part of the revenue mixas saturation becomes a real issue.The company doesn't offer much in the way of expectations for how its revenue breaks down, but we do know that in the previous quarter, Apple enjoyed revenue of $6.3 billion for its ""Services"" division, which is mostly made up of its video, audio and apps arms. That was a 24% year-over-year improvement. That makes it thesecond-biggest category of product for Apple, though it's still well behind the biggest - the iPhone.Facebook Inc (FB) Stock: New All-Time Highs or New Problems?AAPL is even mulling the creation ofits own original television shows and movies, following in the footsteps of on-demand video rivalsNetflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX) andAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN).Donald Trump AgendaIt remains to be seen to what extent, if any, it will be discussed within the Apple earnings report and conference call. Maybe it won't come up at all, but there's no denying AAPL is one of the more vulnerable companies to President Donald Trump's policy plans.Not only might a strict foreign worker and immigration policy limit Apple's access to technical talent, but much-discussed tariffs on Chinese-made imports could start a trade war that leaves Apple right in the middle of it. Not only does Apple sell products to Chinese consumers, it relies on China to make many of the iPhone's key components.Bottom Line for AAPL StockWith a trailing P/E of 14.5, Apple shares are priced fairly  maybe even undervalued. That's apt to be a large part of the reason the pros are collectively rating AAPL a bit better than a ""Buy"" right now (leaning toward a ""Strong buy."") That optimism, though, is a bit suspicious in light of the lackluster results we've seen for the prior three quarters. Apple is going to have to outperform most expectations if the stock's to build any further on the 34% gain it has mustered since May of last year.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 High-Yield Dividend Stocks That Are SOMEHOW Still Bargains7 High-Yield Stocks Ripe For A Short SqueezeThe post3 Things Apple Inc.

Why Isn't Qualcomm's Pain Intel's Gain?;January 30, 2017, 09:28:00 PM EDT;"Shares ofQualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM) recently plunged to a multi-month low after the   chipmaker was hit by an FTCantitrust lawsuitin the U.S. andadditional lawsuitsfrom its longtime customerApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) . Apple, which exclusively used Qualcomm's   baseband modems in its iPhones between 2011 and 2016, claims that   Qualcomm withheld $1 billion in rebate payments (compensation for   that deal) after it cooperated with Korean FTC regulators, which   were probing Qualcomm.Image source: Qualcomm.makeArticleAd();This strained relationship between the two tech giants sounds   like great news forIntel(NASDAQ: INTC) , which started supplying Apple with modems for   the iPhone 7 after its exclusive deal with Qualcomm ended. The   reason is simple -- Apple could potentially buy all of its modems   from Intel if it severs its relationship with Qualcomm.But Intel shares barely budged after Apple sued Qualcomm, and   only recently rallied following its fourth quarter earnings beat.   Let's take a closer look at why investors don't seem convinced   that Qualcomm's pain can generate significant gains for   Intel.Understanding Intel's mobile strategyIntel doesn't report its modem sales separately. They're   included in its massive Client Computing Group, which includes PC   and mobile chips. The group was created in 2015 to divert   attention from the ongoing losses at its mobile division, which   previously reported its results separately. Those losses were   caused by its generous subsidization of OEMs, with co-marketing   agreements, steep discounts, and financial aid for using its   mobile Atom chipsets.By the timeIntel killed offmost of its mobile Atom chips last year, the unit had spent   billions of dollars to capture just 1% of the market. Intel's   fatal mistakes are easy to see in retrospect -- it sold off its   ARM-based Xscale unit in 2006 to focus on x86 chips in 2006, then   rejected Apple's offer to produce application processors for the   first iPhone.Since much of the Android market uses Qualcomm SoCs, which   bundle baseband modems together with ARM-based processors, Intel   realized that the Atom couldn't gain much ground in the mobile   market. Instead, it had to develop modems for OEMs like Apple,   which developed their own ARM-based processors without integrated   modems.Image source: Apple.Why Intel investors aren't excitedThe problem with Intel is that it was likely negotiating terms   with Apple from a position of weakness, due to its need to stay   relevant in the mobile market. Since Intel has a long record of   taking losses to gain market share in the mobile market, it's   reasonable to assume that Intel sold its modems to Apple at very   favorable prices for the hardware maker.Last year, Cowen & Co. analysts estimated that the deal   could  generate $1.5 billion in revenues for Intel -- which   would only equal 2.5% of its projected revenues this year. Even   if Apple dropped Qualcomm and doubled its orders from Intel, that   growth wouldn't significantly offset Intel's sluggish growth in   PC and data center chips. Moreover, those modems would likely   only generate low-margin revenues, which wouldn't significantly   boost its bottom line growth.To make matters worse, Apple throttled the speed of    Qualcomm modems in the iPhone 7 to match the slower speed   of the Intel modems. This indicates that Apple didn't choose   Intel chips because they could match Qualcomm's -- it likely only   did so to reduce Qualcomm's negotiating power. This means that   other OEMs that use stand-alone Qualcomm modems won't likely   switch over to Intel modems anytime soon. This misstep mirrors   Intel's failure in mobile application processors -- several OEMs   initially gave the Atom a chance, but it was doomed by its   inability to match the power efficiency of ARM-based designs.What Intel investors should expectIntel investors shouldn't assume that Apple's battle with   Qualcomm indicates that the two longtime partners will part ways   anytime soon. Apple andSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) have been suing each other for years, yet the   Korean tech giant is still one of its top suppliers. Therefore,   Apple is likely trying to get Qualcomm to lower its chip prices   and licensing fees instead of completely parting ways with the   chipmaker.Even if Apple abandoned Qualcomm, investors shouldn't assume   that Intel will inherit the entire modem business.

How Much Can Apple's Services Drive Profit Growth?;January 30, 2017, 06:11:00 PM EDT;"Image source: Apple.Much has been made ofApple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) services revenue over the last year or so. After   it was clear Apple would struggle to continue growing iPhone   sales following the outstanding success of the iPhone 6, CEO Tim   Cook commented that a ""growing portion of our revenue is directly   driven by our existing install base."" That is, sales of apps,   content, iCloud, Apple Care, and other Apple Services will   account for an outsized portion of Apple's revenue growth going   forward.makeArticleAd();To be clear, Apple is still very much a hardware company.   Apple's services revenue accounted for just 11% of Apple's total   sales in fiscal 2016. The iPhone, by comparison, made up 63% of   revenue. But services revenue grew 22% last year, faster than any   other segment.With stalling hardware sales growth, investors may be   wondering if growing services revenue is enough to move the   needle on Apple's bottom line.All about the marginsDespite its relatively small size, Apple's services business   generates higher margins than its hardware sales. That's simply   the nature of software, which sees wider margins as products   reach scale. And very few companies have the scale of Apple; the   company has over 1 billion devices in use.Apple's App Store sales have a gross margin of about 90%,   according to estimates from Macquarie Securities analyst Ben   Schachter. Overall, he estimates the rest of Apple's services   have a gross margin of 65%. That means Apple's services revenue   has a gross margin about twice as large as its hardware   sales.Importantly, the App Store -- Apple's highest-margin product   -- is one of the fastest-growing pieces of Apple's services. Last   year, App Store revenueclimbed over 33%. Schachter expects it to climb 28% on average over the next five   years while non-App Store services grow just 10% annually. That   means Apple's services margin will continue to expand.How it all impacts Apple's gross profitEven if hardware sales remain flat, that won't prevent Apple   from expanding its install base. As Cook mentioned in the   company's first-quarter earnings call last year, ""Because of the   enduring value of the device, their replacing is likely higher to   be given or sold to someone who will also love and use it often.""   In other words, even if Apple isn't selling more devices directly   to consumers, the user base can grow through third-party resales   or gifting.A growing user base combined with growing service sales per   unit ought to continue driving revenue growth for the segment for   several more years.A dollar in sales growth from services will carry twice the   gross profit, on average, as a dollar in sales growth of Apple's   hardware. So, even though services is a relatively small business   right now, it outpunches its weight class, providing   approximately 21% of gross profits in 2016. That number is set to   expand as more of Apple's sales growth comes from services.As an illustration of the impact of Apple's service revenue   growth, a 20% increase in services revenue in fiscal 2017 would   result in about a 4% increase in the company's total gross profit   and a 70 basis point expansion in gross margin if all else   remains equal. Considering the size of Apple, that's pretty   significant growth. Schachter estimates Apple's gross margin will   expand as much as 400 basis points over the next five years.Gross margin expansion combined with modest revenue growth and   share buybacks should continue to boost Apple's earnings per   share at a fairly steady pace. Analysts expect 13.8% EPS growth   over the next five years, but there could be even more upside   depending on how much margins expand. With shares trading at a   price-to-earnings ratio of just 14.4, shares may still be   undervalued if Apple can maintain hardware sales and continue   growing services revenue as expected.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run     for over a decade,Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has tripled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy right now... and Apple wasn't one of them!

Is the Bar Higher for the Q4 Earnings Season?;January 30, 2017, 03:56:00 PM EDT;"Even as Earnings growth appears to have improved notably relative to the last couple of years, positive surprises appear hard to come to by. This becomes evident from looking at the proportion of companies beating EPS and revenue estimates in the ongoing Q4 earnings season. You can see that in the comparison chart below that compares the proportion of Q4 companies beating EPS and revenue estimates with what this same group of companies reported in the preceding quarter, as well as the 4-quarter and 12-quarter averages.With results from 171 S&P 500 index members already out or 34.1% of the index's total membership, positive surprises are tracking below historical periods, particularly with respect to EPS surprises. If we see this trend continue in the coming days as the rest of Q4 reports come in, then it would mean that estimates likely hadn't dropped enough ahead of the start of this earnings season. In other words, the bar may have been bit higher this time around relative to other recent quarters.makeArticleAd();With respect to the Q4 earnings season scorecard, we now have results from 171 S&P 500 members that have reported as of January 30th. Total earnings for these 171 index members are up +6% from the same period last year on +3.1% higher revenues, with 64.3% beating EPS estimates and 54.4% beating revenue estimates. We discussed earlier how the proportion of companies beating EPS and revenue estimates has been tracking below historical periods. But we don't have that issue on the growth front, with both earnings and revenue growth tracking above other historical periods for the same group of 171 index members.The chart below shows how the Q4 earnings and revenue growth rate for these 171 companies compare with other recent periods.The Finance sector is a big contributor to the aggregate growth picture at this stage. For the Finance sector, we now have Q4 results from 57.9% of the sector's total market cap in the S&P 500 index. Total earnings for these Finance sector companies are up +11.3% from the same period last year on +3.1% higher revenues, with 67.5% beating EPS estimates and 45% beating revenue estimates. Excluding the Finance sector from the results thus far, total earnings for the rest of the S&P 500 companies that have reported would be up +3.9% from the same period last year on +3% higher revenues. This is still better growth than we have seen from the same group of ex-Finance S&P 500 members, as the comparison chart below shows.Looking at Q4 as a whole, combining the actual results from the 171 index members that have reported results with estimates from the still-to-come 329 companies, total earnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to be up +5.3% from the same period last year on +4% higher revenues. Excluding the Finance sector, the Q4 earnings growth drops to +1% on +4.2% higher revenues.For the Technology sector, total Q4 earnings are expected to be up +5.9% from the same period last year on +4.4% higher revenues.Apple(AAPL), which alone brings in roughly a quarter of the sector's total earnings, is expected to report -7.8% lower earnings on +0.4% higher revenues as it comes out with its quarterly results after the close on Tuesday January 31st. Excluding the Apple drag, total Q4 earnings for the rest of the Tech sector would be up +11.4% on +5.5% higher revenues.Facebook(FB), which reports after the market's close on Wednesday February 1st, doesn't carry as much weight in the sector as the iPhone maker. But Facebook's Q4 earnings are expected to be up +91% from the same period last year on +44.5% higher revenues.Amazon(AMZN) isn't technically a Technology stock (it's a retailer), but it is also expected to show strong growth in its quarterly report that comes out after the close on Thursday February 2nd.Looking beyond Q4, the growth pace is expected to ramp up notably in the current and following quarters, as the chart below shows.As you can see, total 2017 Q1 earnings for the S&P 500 index are currently expected to be up +8.7% from the same period last year. The chart below shows Q1 earnings growth expectations have evolved over the last few weeks.It is not unusual for 2017 Q1 estimates to be coming down at this stage of the 2016 Q4 reporting cycle, but a lot will depend on the pace and magnitude of these negative revisions in the coming days. At this stage, Q1 estimates aren't falling by as much as has historically been the case. This should add to confidence in market expectations for the following quarters when growth is expected to really ramp up.Note: Note: Sheraz Mian regularly provides earnings analysis on Zacks.com and appears frequently in the print and electronic media.

3 Stocks That Could Move Big This Week;January 30, 2017, 03:30:00 PM EDT;"This week,Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) ,Facebook(NASDAQ: FB) , andAmazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) are all scheduled to report results for their most   recently ended quarter, making this one of the most interesting   weeks of this earnings season. With Apple on deck, here's why   these stocks could be big movers.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();Searching for growthScheduled to report results for its fiscal first-quarter of   2017 on Tuesday, Jan. 31, investors will likely be watching a   number of key items closely. But Apple's top line for the current   quarter, and the company's guidance for revenue in its second   fiscal quarter of 2017, will likely be the main drivers behind   any moves in the stock price after the results go live.For its first quarter, Apple guided for revenue of $76 billion   to $78 billion, up from $75.9 billion in the year-ago quarter.   Investors will be looking for Apple to meet or exceed its   guidance range, particularly since Apple has reported   year-over-year revenue declines in the last three quarters.   Revenue in this range would mark an all-time high for the   company.For Apple's second-quarter revenue guidance, the number for   Apple to beat will be its fiscal second-quarter revenue in 2016   of $50.6 billion. Anything less than this figure would mean the   tech giant expects to return to year-over-year decline.Can this tech giant keep up its momentum?For Facebook's fourth-quarter earnings release on Wednesday,   Feb. 1, investors will also likely be honing in on the company's   reported revenue, though expectations for Facebook's growth are   far more optimistic than what investors expect from Apple these   days. While it's unrealistic to expect Facebook to report the   same 56% year-over-year revenue growth it reported in Q3 given   the company's tough year-ago comparison of 44% year-over-year   revenue growth, investors will likely look for any deceleration   in revenue growth to be modest. I'll be looking for   fourth-quarter revenue growth of about 45%.Image source: Amazon.Beyond Facebook's revenue growth, another area that could move   the stock is the company's reported user metrics. While any   surprises on user metrics are unlikely considering the company's   consistent upward march in monthly active users and user   engagement, a sudden pullback in user growth or engagement could   spook some investors. Investors should look for the social   network's monthly active users to increase about three to four   percent sequentially and its user engagement, or daily active   users as a percentage of monthly active users, to be 66% or   better -- figures that would maintain recent user performance   trends.Can holiday sales live up to big expectations?Going into Amazon's Feb. 2 fourth-quarter report, management   didn't provide a very narrow guidance range for expected revenue   growth. Amazon said it expected revenue to increase anywhere   between 17% to 27% year over year. This wide range for potential   net sales growth for the quarter will likely have many investors   watching the important holiday quarter's revenue.Analysts are betting Amazon's sales for the quarter will fall   at the high end of management's guidance, according to analyst   estimates compiled by Thomson Reuters. On average, analysts are   expecting net sales of $44.7 billion, up 25% year over year.If any of these companies under- or over-perform these   expectations by a meaningful margin, these high-profile stocks   could make big moves. But investors should put any moves into the   context of the companies' broader, big-picture performance and   their long-term potential; the market often leans toward   shortsightedness and can overreact to news. Still, any   significant deviation reported from these key metrics would   likely require some further analysis.Find out why Facebookis one of the 10 best stocks to buy nowMotley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent       more than a decade beating the market.

3 Stocks to Buy for Better Deals Than the Great Recession;January 30, 2017, 02:42:59 PM EDT;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTheS&P 500has more than tripled since it hit its low point of the Great Recession on March 9, 2009. There were plenty of stocks to buy back then that offered incredible value. For investors that weren't old enough or didn't have the resources to invest back then, it may seem like you've missed the boat. After all, the old investing adage is to buy low and sell high.makeArticleAd();Source:PixabayAlmost every stock worth owning has a much higher share price now than it did on the day the S&P 500 bottomed in 2009, but just because share prices were lower back in 2009 doesn't necessarily mean that buyers were getting a better deal.10 Stocks to Buy That Already Make America GreatAs the stock market has risen, so have corporate earnings. Even though investors are now paying more for each share of stock, they are also getting more earnings bang for their buck. Here's a look at three stocks that are a better value today than they were on March 9, 2009.Stocks to Buy: Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS)Source:Erik DrostGoldman Sachs Group Inc(NYSE:GS) was right in the eye of the Great Recession storm. The company even received a $10 billion bailout from the government during the meltdown.In the years since the crisis, new regulations and capital requirements severely hindered bank earnings. For GS stock, the heaviest weight has been the Volcker Rule. The Volcker Rule is a provision in the Dodd-Frank Act that prevents banks from performing certain types of speculative trading.Despite the regulatory headwinds, GS has found a way to ramp up its earnings in recent years. Goldman's net income is up more than 180% since 2009, making GS stock an even better value today than it was back then. Goldman's current price-to-earnings ratio is only 14.2, 19% lower than it was on March 9, 2009.Looking ahead,  Donald Trump has pledged to eliminate many of the regulations that have been holding back the big banks. Goldman stock is in an even better position and it is a better value today than it was in the years following the Great Recession.Stocks to Buy: Visa Inc (V)Source:K rlis Dambr ns via FlickrThe market forVisa Inc(NYSE:V) is dramatically changing. While mobile competition fromPayPal Holdings Inc(NASDAQ:PYPL),Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) and others may certainly disrupt the traditional payment business, Visa should be just fine. A recentBI Intelligencereport concluded that merchant service providers (MSPs) are much more threatened by mobile payment competition than the credit card companies themselves.The proof is in the pudding. Even with the emergence of platforms like Apple Pay, Visa's profits have exploded more than 400% since 2009. BMO Capital analystPaulo Ribeiroexpects Visa's double-digit earnings growth to continue in the long-term. He believes V stock will continue to benefit from the slow death of cash and check payments.7 High-Yield Stocks Ripe For A Short SqueezeEven though V stock has been a top performer in the market since the Great Recession, that incredible earnings growth means Visa's P/E ratio is down 60% from where it was when the market bottomed in 2009. In other words, V stock is a much better value today than it was back then.Stocks to Buy: Berkshire Hathaway Inc. ( BRK.B)Source:Pete Souza via Wikimedia (Modified)If you're looking for stocks to buy in the market today that would make 2009 investors envious, it doesn't get much better thanBerkshire Hathaway Inc.(NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B). The holding company of the most iconic and successful value investor of all time is currently trading at a better value than it was during the Great Recession.Warren Buffett's BRK.B stock now has a P/E of 17, which is down roughly 21% since March 9, 2009. Buffett and Berkshire have done very well since the Great Recession. But thanks to BRK.B's 823% income growth, investors now get a better value for Berkshire shares than they did at the market bottom.If anyone can find value in the stock market after it climbs 235% in eight years, it's the Oracle of Omaha. Instead of losing sleep over stocks to buy with the market at an all-time high, why not just invest in Buffett? Unlike high school, there's no penalty for cheating off of the smart kid's paper.As of this writing, Wayne Duggan did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.The post3 Stocks to Buy for Better Deals Than the Great Recessionappeared first onInvestorPlace."
6 Reasons Why Investors Should Take A Bite Into Apple;January 30, 2017, 02:40:41 PM EDT;"Apple, Inc. (AAPL) is expected to revert towards the growth curve during the December quarter of 2016 after a drop in the previous three quarters which led to its first ever full-year decline of sales in a decade. However, as the technology giant prepares to announce its quarterly earnings, the invisible cloud of over-expectation is bound to envelop its stock.Heres a closer look at the iPhone maker and why investors should consider taking a bite into Apple.1. Strong FundamentalsmakeArticleAd();Although Apples FY2016 revenue witnessed some decline, raising discussions over its growth and innovation story, its fundamentals remain intact. Apple maintains a healthy operating margin and in-control debt structure with its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling a whopping $237.58 billion at the end of FY2016. With a projected revenue between $76 billion and $78 billion during Q1 FY2017, Apple should make a smooth bounce back, both sequentially as well as year-on-year.2. RepatriationWhile Apple is cash rich, 90% of it is held by its foreign subsidiaries outside the U.S. to avoid the heavy taxation on repatriation. Now, with Donald Trump as U.S. President, there is the possibility that a one-time tax of 10% on repatriation may be levied to encourage companies to bring back trillions of dollars of money to the American soil.More than a decade back, a similar one-time tax holiday on repatriation was provided under the Homeland Investment Act of 2004. Apaperanalyzing companies during that period points out that repatriations were associated with significantly higher levels of shareholder payouts, mainly through share repurchases reflecting good governance and financial health of the U.S. multi-national corporations.If such a tax rebate is provided again, investors could benefit directly in the form of share buybacks and dividend payouts. If that isnt the case, such repatriation may be directed towards increasing domestic investment, employment and R&D which would boost growth and hence benefit investors indirectly.3. ServicesWhile the iPhone continues to be the biggest revenue generator among all of Apples products, its services segment has seen an impressive growth in recent quarters. Apples services include revenue from Internet services (such as Apple Music, iTunes, and the App Store), iCloud, AppleCare, ApplePay, licensing, and other services. Services is emerging as an important segment of Apples revenue stream and is likely to grow stronger as its ecosystem of more than one billion devices expands further.4. Profit ShareAs the global smartphone market is moving towards stabilized long term growth, low-priced smartphones are becoming popular, especially in emerging markets. Thistrendhas notably weighed on Apples shipments which are sold much above the average selling price for smartphones.However, despite all odds, Apple still captured 91% share of all smartphone operating profit worldwide during Q3 2016 as per areport. Further, as 2017 marks the 10th anniversary of iPhones debut, there is great excitement building around its next iPhone model.The iPhone set the standard for mobile computing in its first decade and we are just getting started. The best is yet to come,saidTim Cook, Apples CEO.5. Research & DevelopmentApple is known for keeping its projects under wraps, however, its increased spending on research and development, from $4.5 billion in 2013 to $10 billion in 2016, displays its commitment to innovate and evolve new technology that enhances and expands its existing product range.Apple is now focusing on advanced technological areas such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, virtual and augmented reality, and automation. In aletterto NHTSA dated November, 2016, Apple wrote, The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation. Further, Apple recentlyjoinedAmazon, Facebook, Google/DeepMind, IBM, and Microsoft to become a founding member of thePartnership on AI.6. DividendApplesquarterly dividendhas risen gradually since 2012. The company has paid $2.49 billion, $10.56 billion, $11.12 billion, $11.56 billion and $12.15 billion as dividends and equivalents during 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively. Although its current quarterly dividend is small at $0.57 per share, it acts as a sweetener considering that the company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis.Final WordAs the largest company in terms of market capitalization and worldsmost valuablebrand, investors and analysts alike follow Apple closely, reacting to news concerning the technology giant. While some decline in the market share is bound to occur with rising competition in the smartphone space (especially against low-cost devices), Apples brand appeal and customer loyalty remain intact.Apple is investing in technologies of the future that would open newer revenue streams and is committed to bring innovative products in the market. A healthy balance sheet, decent growth numbers, regular dividend and less volatile stock movement make Apple a healthy pick for an investors portfolio. Its shares are up by 28% over the last one year and 5.27% year-to-date, which mean that investors have already factored in decent numbers during its upcoming earnings report on January 31, 2017.The author has no position in any stocks mentioned.Investors should consider the above information not as a de facto recommendation, but as an idea for further consideration."
Apple Inc. Gets Extra Help From the Dual Camera iPhone 7 Plus (AAPL);January 30, 2017, 01:52:27 PM EDT;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhenApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) first introduced its new, big and bigger smartphones - the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus - the company opted to offer a few minor features for buyers of the largest model. The 6 Plus had longer battery life, and an image stabilized camera. That basic strategy continued with the 6s Plus in 2015. But last year with the iPhone 7 Plus, AAPL included a more significant carrot in the signature Dual Camera feature.makeArticleAd();Source: AppleThe move of making a key feature exclusive to its larger phones appears to have paid off with a big increase in iPhone 7 Plus sales compared to regular iPhone 7 sales.Having more of the costlier iPhone 7 Plus models in the mix means AAPL can generate more revenue, even if overall unit sales are soft.Differentiating Between Big and BiggerHistorically, the larger-sized iPhone hasn't sold nearly as well as the ""standard"" 4.7-inch model.When AAPL first introduced the two model strategy in 2014, the iPhone 6 Plus had an immediate bump in demand from Apple fans who were hungry for a phablet. It was also very popular in Asian markets, where phablets, which can take the place of both smartphone and tablet, are often preferred. However, overall the bigger and more expensive iPhone 6 Plus only accounted foraround 20% of overall iPhone salesglobally.10 Stocks to Buy That Already Make America GreatIn 2015, AAPL added a little more appeal to the bigger iPhone, adding increased RAM to the optically image stabilized camera for the iPhone 6 Plus. However, that saw just a small uptick in sales of the bigger model.Last year, Apple rolled the dice: It decided to release a dual camera smartphone, a premium upgrade that it heavily promoted as a must-have feature. With this advanced camera system, users could take DSLR-like portraits and optically zoom in on subjects. AAPL made this key feature an iPhone 7 Plus exclusive, at the same time boosting the price of its larger iPhone. Previously, it had charged $649 and $749 respectively for the two sizes. In 2016, the company still started the iPhone 7 at $649, but to get the dual camera smartphone feature required shelling out at least $769 for the iPhone 7 Plus.iPhone 7 Sales See Big Increase in iPhone 7 Plus AdoptionTheWall Street Journalis reporting that Apple's iPhone 7 Plus strategy appears to have paid off. Citing numbers from Cowen & Co. UBS, Cowen and Creative Strategies Inc., theWSJsays that in AAPL's first quarter (ending in December), theiPhone 7 Plus is estimated to have accounted for 40% of total iPhone 7 sales, globally.Breaking the numbers down regionally, it's estimated that 52% of Chinese iPhone buyers opted for the more expensive iPhone 7 Plus, while in the U.S. it accounted for 47% of total iPhone 7 sales.Why Increased iPhone 7 Plus to iPhone 7 Sales MatterThe difference between the two iPhone models is material to AAPL's bottom line.Apple Inc. New iPads Might Be Late to the Party (AAPL)It's likely that the iPhone 7 Plus costs Apple more to manufacture than previous Plus versions - it does have more RAM, a larger battery and that dual camera system - but at least some of the additional cost is offset by the boost from $749 to $769.The profit margin for Apple on the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus probably remains roughly the same. However, with a base price that's $120 higher, having more Plus models in the mix means that even if overall iPhone 7 sales are soft, the average selling price of a new iPhone goes up. As a result, iPhone revenue could get a boost, despite sales that may not meet expectations.And, as theWSJarticle points out, there's another positive point for AAPL in the iPhone 7 Plus numbers. The fact that pricing the iPhone 7 Plus so high still resulted in big gains for the premium smartphone bodes well for later this year when the company will release the10th anniversary iPhone 8. The iPhone 7 sales numbers indicate that AAPL has additional room to price the iPhone 8 as an ultra-premium, special edition model if it chooses.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace3 Things Apple Inc.

The tech company doesn't operate an App Store in Iran, but it has been allowing citizens in the country to use the American version of the app. This resulted in several apps from Iranian developers making it onto the American App Store. However, the company is now pulling those apps from the App Store. This is likely due to Iranian Transactions Sanctions Regulations (31CFR Part 560), which limits trade with the country.watchOS 3.2 Beta:AAPL is now letting developers play with the first watchOS 3.2 beta, reportsMacRumors. This new beta includes features that will likely be coming to the device when watchOS 3.2 gets a final release. The beta includes the new Theater mode that previous patch notes from AAPL have mentioned. This feature silences the device for movie watch. It also includes SiriKit, which lets users have Siri perform tasks without taking out their connected iPhone devices.UltraFine Display:There are problems with the new LG UltraFine 5K Display that Apple recommends to MacBook Pro users,9to5Macnotes. The problem affecting the LG UltraFine 5K Display has to do with routers. When the device is within a 2 meters of a router, it will become unstable.

3 Earnings Reports You Need to Watch This Week;January 30, 2017, 11:37:43 AM EDT;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe markets started last week off hot, but ended with a couple slight down days thanks to the one-two punch of not-so-hot corporate earnings and worse-than-expected GDP growth.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockStill, despite the softness, theS&P 500has enjoyed a more or less steady upward trend over the past year or so, tallying around 20% gains over the past 12 months. And there are plenty of individual stocks that could break the downtrend.For instance,Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL),Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMD) andUnder Armour Inc(NYSE:UAA) are all reporting their latest quarterly numbers this week - and all investors should be paying attention.10 Stocks to Buy That Already Make America GreatLet's take a look at what's in store for these picks.Earnings to Watch:Apple (AAPL)Source:Yuanbin Du Via FlickrApple, which has more or less risen in tandem with the S&P 500 over the past year, will report earnings on Tuesday after the market close.The tech giant is looking to notch its third straight earnings beat-although a beat would still translate to an earnings decline. Wall Street is expecting $3.22 per share compared to last year's $3.28 per share, and that fall is despite expectations for a slight uptick in revenue.Apple has suffered several straight quarters of falling sales, but analysts expect a strong holiday season driven by the iPhone 7 to return the company to organic growth. Even if that growth is meager and earnings shrink slightly, I expect investors to be pleased.Remember, Apple is no longer the growth darling it once was. But 20% gains over the last year plus a solid dividend make a pretty strong case for the stock. I think investors will be reminded of the new Apple's appeal when earnings are released tomorrow.Earnings to Watch:Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)Source:Matthew Rutledge via FlickrAdvanced Micro Devices is another company that doesn't have too much growth in its near-term forecast despite sales growth. Oftentimes, companies fail to grow sales, but still manage to grow earnings thanks to cost savings or accounting tricks.But in the case of AMD, the loss per share is expected to be a penny worse than it was a year ago due to higher costs and despite double-digit sales growth.The pain isn't expected to end after this quarter either; the full-year earnings forecast is also in the red. But I do like AMD's long-term prospects, as it's introduced new products and inked new partnerships and deals, including one withAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG,NASDAQ:GOOGL.7 Awful Stocks You Need To Ditch Right AwayIf AMD happens to get battered after its earnings report Tuesday, I wouldn't hesitate to buy some shares on the cheap.Earnings to Watch:Under Armour (UAA)Source: ShutterstockUnder Armour is the only stock on this list that has earnings growth on-tap for the current quarter. And while the 4% growth Wall Street expects isn't that mind-blowing, it's a fraction of the growth that's expected down the road.Full-year earnings are expected to enjoy 13% year-over-year growth, while the five-year average is expected to top 20%. Meanwhile, sales growth is also expected to come in north of 20% and stay there in quarters to come.So far, UAA stock has been battling some headwinds: Shares are currently right at their 50-day moving average and are under the 200-day. A good earnings report could be the catalyst needed to turn that long-term average to a floor instead of a ceiling.Under Armour stock also reports on Tuesday.Hilary Kramer is the editor ofGameChangers,Breakout Stocks Under $10,High Octane Trader,Absolute Capital ReturnandValue Authority.

What to Expect When Cirrus Logic Inc. Reports Earnings This Wednesday;January 30, 2017, 11:34:00 AM EDT;"Image Source: Cirrus LogicWhen audio codec supplierCirrus Logic(NASDAQ: CRUS) releases its fiscal 2017 third quarter results on   Feb. 1, investors can expect another period of rapid growth from   the company. Cirrus Logic has benefited fromApple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) decision to remove the headphone jack from the   latest generation of iPhones, leading to strong sales of its   wireless headset solutions. This should drive a strong quarterly   performance at Cirrus, but the company's over-dependence on Apple   for 78% of its revenue could be a deal-breaker as far as the   broad investor outlook is concerned.makeArticleAd();Apple will drive strong growth for Cirrus in the third     quarter . . .Cirrus expects to post third quarter revenue of $475 million   to $515 million with a gross margin of 48%. The midpoint of this   guidance puts its year-over-year growth at an impressive 42%,   which is not surprising given the content gains that Cirrus has   witnessed in the iPhone 7.A teardown of the latest smartphone by Chipworks revealed that   the device uses three audio amplifiers from Cirrus, as compared   to two in the iPhone 6S. Now, the actual device is not the only   place where Cirrus is going to make money. iFixit's X-ray of the   Lightning-to-3.5mm adapter, used to connect legacy headphones to   the iPhone 7, reveals the presence of audio codecs from Cirrus as   well.What's more, Cirrus has also supplied digital-to-analog   converter chips for the Lightning EarPods, according to a   teardown of the device by the Vietnamese site Tinhte. All of this   indicates that Cirrus has received a serious bump in its chip   content at Apple. In fact, Pacific Crest Securities forecasts   additional content gains of $2.50 for Cirrus Logic with the   iPhone 7, including the Lightning EarPods and the second stereo   speaker.Encouraged by the booming business, Cirrus seems to have   directed most of its manufacturing capacity toward making chips   for the iPhone and related accessories. This is why revenue from   its largest customer shot up to 78% of total sales in the July to   September quarter, when iPhone production was being ramped up, as   compared to 63% in the year-ago period.iPhone orders from suppliers for the December quarter   reportedly stood at 89 million units. Now, the iPhone 7 and 7   Plus won't account for 100% of Apple's device sales. To provide   some perspective, sales of these two models reportedly made up   72% of total iPhone sales in the U.S. in the fourth quarter,   according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners.Assuming that 72% of the 89 million iPhone unit orders Apple   placed in the fourth quarter were for the two new devices, that   would account for approximately 64 million units. Multiplying   this estimated unit count by additional content gains of $2.50   for each device, Cirrus revenue would increase by $160 million   from the prior-year period when it reported total revenue of $348   million.This alone puts Cirrus revenue at about $508 million for the   fiscal third quarter, which falls at the higher end of its   guidance range. But apart from the dollar content gains,   Cirrus will also benefit from the production of an additional   nine million iPhone units as compared to the Dec. 2015 quarter,   when estimated volume stood at 80 million. Therefore, Cirrus is   poised to outperform even the higher end of its guidance   range.. . . but hurt its longer term outlookHowever, Cirrus Logic's outlook could prove to be a problem as   iPhone production in the first calendar quarter of 2017 is   expected to decline to about 42 million units, as indicated by aUBSreport. Earlier, Apple was expected to produce 43 million iPhones   during the period, but it has reportedly downsized production in   order to avoid an inventory glut.Assuming the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus maintain a 72% share of   overall production, these two devices will account for   approximately 30 million units in the current quarter. With the   $2.50 per unit of additional content, the new devices will add   $75 million to Cirrus' top line in the fiscal fourth quarter.To factor in the lower production volume, iPhone builds in the   year-ago quarter stood at an estimated 55 million units. This   puts the anticipated year-over-year decline in volume at 13   million units. Assuming that the production cut pertains to the   older iPhone 6S, Cirrus' revenue could drop by as much as $45   million since it was making $3.50 on each unit of the prior   generation device.Therefore, the revenue gains from the iPhone 7 will be reduced   to just $30 million after accounting for the decline in overall   production. This indicates that Cirrus could post sales of   approximately $262 million in the fiscal fourth quarter as its   revenue in the prior-year period was $232 million. Barring major   gains in other business areas, Wall Street analyst estimates   of between $312 million and $350 million in fiscal fourth   quarter revenue will be tough to beat.This tough outlook could lead to a potential sell-off since   investors will consider booking profits as Cirrus Logic shares   have already doubled in the past year.

Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.Click here to find out which 9 other ETFs had   notable inflows "
Plenty of Grist for the Market Mill This Week;January 30, 2017, 10:00:00 AM EDT;"Monday, January 30, 2017makeArticleAd();Plenty of grist for the mill of the markets this week, including Personal Income & Spending today, news from the Bank of Japan's policy meeting tomorrow, news from the latest Federal Reserve meeting Wednesday, and, of course, the heart of Q4 earnings season. For a comprehensive account of these and many more events this week, check out Zacks Chief Strategist John Blank's latest Global Market Ahead:4 Good Reasons to Focus on the USAPersonal Income & Spending showed a gap of 2 percentage points: income grew 0.3% in December (analysts had expected 0.4%) while spending ran hotter at 0.5%. Income in November was revised from unchanged to +0.1%. Because we're talking about fractions of percentage points, none of this is extremely ""newsy"" at the moment, although in aggregate over time we may see some patterns emerging, and of course we'd prefer to see incomes rise as much as spending, if possible.No big names are reporting earnings until ExxonMobilXOMTuesday morning and AppleAAPLafter the bell tomorrow, although we will hear from a couple Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) companies like BofI HoldingBOFIand Heritage OaksHEOP. Other big firms like FacebookFBand AmazonAMZNwill report later in the week.It will be interesting to see how the market interprets - if it decides to interpret - events developing out of the White House over the weekend, including an executive order from President Trump to ban Muslim citizens from the U.S. from seven predominantly Muslim countries. The Trump Rally had been priced for perfection, after all, and abrupt actions such as these often have a way of seeing the markets hit the brakes a bit.Of course, the market may instead simply focus on the here and now: the proposed tax cuts and deregulation should still provide a windfall for publicly traded companies, if not in the immediate term then sometime down the road. But the divisiveness that appears to be promoted by President Trump may add a new wrinkle into the proceedings.

Can Apple (AAPL) be a Suitable Value Pick at the Moment?;January 30, 2017, 09:55:00 AM EDT;"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn't want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?makeArticleAd();One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let's putApple Inc.AAPLstock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock's current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Apple has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 14.75. This level compares favorably with the market at large, as the PE ratio for the S&P 500 comes in at about 20.11.If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Apple's current PE level puts it slightly above its midpoint over the past five years, with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months. Hence, this does not provide us with a conclusive direction as to the relative valuation of the stock in comparison to its own historical trend.Meanwhile, the stock's PE compares favorably with the Zacks classified Computer & Technology sector's trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 22.08. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Apple has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year's earnings) of just 13.70, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead forApple stockin the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock's price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Apple has a P/S ratio of about 3.05. This is a bit higher than the Computer & Technology sector's average, which comes in at 2.96 right now. In fact, over the last year, Apple's figure has been quite close to the sector's average, as we can see in the chart below:However, the current level lies near to the median of the stock's own historical trend (which stands at 2.93). This again does not provide us with any conclusive direction as to the relative valuation of the stock in comparison to its own trend.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Apple currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of 'B', putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Apple a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the PEG ratio for Apple is just 1.20, a level that is far lower than the industry average of 5.06. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock's earnings growth rate. Clearly, AAPL is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though Apple might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of 'D' and a Momentum score of 'F'. This gives AAPL a Zacks VGM score-or its overarching fundamental grade-of 'D'. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scoreshere >>)Meanwhile, the company's recent earnings estimates have been trending downwards slightly. The current quarter has seen one estimate go higher in the past sixty days compared to three lower, while the full year estimate has seen one upward revision and eight downward revisions in the same time period.This has had just a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has inched lower by 0.3% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has declined nearly 2%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Apple Inc. Price and ConsensusApple Inc. Price and Consensus|Apple Inc. QuoteThis somewhat dull trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineApple forms a part of the Zacks Computer-Mini industry. The industry is highly competitive and thus Apple faces significant competition in most of its operating markets from respective segment leaders like Hewlett-Packard, Google, Samsung, etc. Moreover, the demand for high-end devices has been soft recently, owing to global macroeconomic weakness, especially with currency volatility and declining commodity prices in some key regions across the globe.In fact, over the past two years, the Zacks Computer-Mini industry has clearly underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:Apple is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. However, with a sluggish industry rank (Bottom 14% out of more than 250 industries) and a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall.So, value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn bullish in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.Zacks' Top Investment Ideas for Long-Term ProfitHow would you like to see our best recommendations to help you find today's most promising long-term stocks?

The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights: Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and Intel;January 30, 2017, 09:30:00 AM EDT;"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL - January 30, 2017 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog includeMicrosoft(NASDAQ:MSFT-Free Report),Apple(NASDAQ:AAPL-Free Report),Amazon(NASDAQ:AMZN-Free Report),Alphabet(NASDAQ:GOOGL-Free Report) andIntel(NASDAQ:INTC-Free Report).Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations.Get #1Stock of the Day pick for free.Here are highlights from Friday's Analyst Blog:The Cloud Drives Technology Stocks This QuarterAnalysts and experts have talked at length about the importance of cloud computing and how it would transform the technology sector. But the sense of waiting that underpinned such discussions is now giving way to a sense of arrival.Several factors are making cloud computing a reality today, the most important of which are an awareness of the resultant cost reductions, awareness of the economic value of processing ever-increasing volumes of data, and recognition of the advantages of sharing resources and having anytime anywhere access to data and information.Of course, along with all these advantages comes concerns related to privacy and security, which have been further exacerbated by government snooping, gag orders and orders to turn over data in private individual devices or in servers on foreign soil that have in turn made individuals and corporations wary about adopting the cloud.But technology companies are fighting it out. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT-Free Report) for one has strongly resisted government demands as have Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL-Free Report) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN-Free Report). Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOGL-Free Report) Google has also been vocal in its opposition. It makes perfect sense when you consider that these are some of the biggest cloud computing stocks that also offer computing and other devices. So they have vested interests at both ends of the networks.Other players with similar interests are chip makers like Intel (NASDAQ:INTC-Free Report); networking companies like Cisco and Juniper; and software/service companies like IBM and Oracle.Here's a brief glimpse of three cloud companies that just reported December quarter results:IntelIntel's results this quarter were driven by both the PC and data center businesses. The PC strength was seasonal and unlikely to be sustained.Although non-volatile memory had the strongest growth rate of 24.8% and will grow even stronger this year, it currently contributes a lower share of revenue, which equates to fewer incremental dollars. Also, the business is poised to benefit from Intel's strength in the server market.Data center revenue growth of 8% year over year was helped by platform volume growth of 3% and platform price increase of 4%. Intel has new products in the pipeline and will also be integrating some technology it acquired through Altera, so this year may be less disappointing than the last when enterprise softness skewed expectations.MicrosoftMicrosoft has become a cloud-focused company, impressing analysts and investors alike. The company is making the most of legacy workloads that use its software and its all-new Windows OS, while leveraging Office productivity software and enterprise relationships to post record growth in cloud revenue.The company reported solid cloud results, with Azure revenue growing 93% (95% in constant currency) and compute usage doubling year over year. Its cloud productivity business also saw strong growth: Office 365 commercial revenue grew 47% (49% in constant currency) with seat growth of 37% and monthly active iOS and Android devices more than doubling to 65 million, Office 365 consumer revenue grew 22% (21% in constant currency) with seat growth of 20.9%.Dynamics 365 paid seats also more than doubled. Nadella promised commercial cloud annualized revenue runrate of $20.0 billion in 2018 and last quarter's $14.0 billion means that Microsoft is definitely on track to beat or exceed the target.AlphabetAlphabet doesn't break out its cloud revenue separately although independent market research data indicates that it is well behind market leader Amazon and even runners up Microsoft. In fact after the December quarter results some analysts have started saying that Microsoft has also started pulling away from the pack in its chase of Amazon.Alphabet's growth should not be discounted however because while cloud and hardware are lumped together right now, its common knowledge that most of its new hardware has been unavailable for a lot of the time. So the 62% growth in this segment seems to be less on account of hardware sales and more of an indication of strength it is seeing in the cloud.CFO Ruth Porat has said that cloud, hardware and YouTube subscriptions will be ""major revenue drivers for Google in the next several years."" This will of course require capital investment, something the company can afford given the way the search business continues to rake in cash. Capex was around $3.08 billion last quarter, that's nearly up by a billion dollars and will mostly be spent on data centers to support its cloud business.Now See Our Private Investment IdeasWhile the above ideas are being shared with the public, other trades are hidden from everyone but selected members.

Will It Continue?Corporate earnings have started growing again, with growth in the ongoing Q4 earnings season on track to reach its highest level in 8 quarters. Growth is still modest - the Q4 earnings growth is currently on track to reach +5.2% and the final growth tally for the quarter will at best be a couple of percentage points higher. But this is still a notable improvement over what we were experiencing in the recent past.Please recall that earnings growth turned positive only in 2016 Q3, having declined in each of the preceding 5 quarters.Positive surprises, particularly on the earnings front, are tracking below other historical periods at this stage. We will see if this trend continues this week as we enter the heart of the earnings season, with more 400 companies coming out with quarterly results, including 106 S&P 500 members.Q4 Scorecard(as of January 27, 2017)We have crossed the one-third mark in the Q4 reporting cycle, with results from 170 S&P 500 members, or 33.9% of the index's total membership, already out. Total earnings for these 170 index members are up +6.0% on +3.1% higher revenues, with 64.1% beating EPS estimates and 54.7% coming ahead of top-line expectations.The Q4 growth pace is notably tracking above what we had seen from the same group of 170 index members in other recent periods. But positive surprises are tracking on the low side at this stage, particularly on the earnings front. The 64.1% proportion of Q4 companies beating EPS estimates compares to 81.2% in the preceding quarter, 76.3% as the 4-quarter average and 72.2% as the 12-quarter average. Positive revenue surprises are tracking below what we had seen from the same group of companies in Q3, but are roughly in-line with historical periods.Standout SectorsSectors with strong growth and better than expected results include the Finance, Technology, Construction, Industrial Products, Basic Materials and Consumer Discretionary sectors. Positive surprises for all of these sectors are tracking above the index level.Finance: With results from 57.7% of the sector's market cap in the S&P 500 index already out, total earnings for the sector are up +11.3% from the same period last year on +3.1% higher revenues, with +66.7% beating EPS estimates and +46.2% beating top-line estimates.This is a better growth performance than we have seen from the sector in other recent periods. Please note that positive surprises are as hard to come by in the Finance sector as they are elsewhere.Strong Finance sector growth is a big driver of the aggregate growth performance for the S&P 500 index as a whole. Excluding the Finance sector, the Q4 growth pace still compares favorably with other recent periods, but a lot less so.Technology: For the Technology sector, we now have Q4 results from 59.6% of the sector's total market cap. Total earnings for these companies are up +7.2% from the same period last year on +4.9% higher revenues, with 69% beating EPS estimates and 82.8% beating revenue estimates.We will see what this week'sApple(NASDAQ:AAPL-Free Report) andFacebook(NASDAQ:FB-Free Report) reports bring, but the sector's Q4 earnings and revenue growth is about in-line with what we saw from this same group of Tech companies in the preceding quarter (2016 Q3), though it is notably tracking above the 4-quarter and 12-quarter averages. With respect to positive surprises, Tech companies appear to be beating EPS estimates at a lower proportion than has historically been the case, though the proportion of positive earnings surprises remains above the index level. Revenue surprises, on the other hand, are tracking notably above historical periods.Key Reports for the Week of January 30thTuesday - 1/31/2017: Monday has a relatively light reporting docket, but Tuesday is very busy with more than 90 companies reporting results, including 33 S&P 500 members (of which 22 are in the morning). The focus will be on Apple, which reports after the market's close.Exxon(NYSE:XOM-Free Report) will be a key report in the morning.Apple is expected to report $3.22 in earnings on $76.2 billion in revenues, which compare to $3.28 on $75.9 billion in revenues in the year-earlier period. The stock is up +9.7% since November 8th vs. +7% for the S&P 500 index and +6.1% for the Zacks Technology sector. December quarter estimates have been stable in recent days, though they have come down for the March quarter.Wednesday - 2/01/2017: Facebook is the most high profile of the 27 index members reporting results today (it will report after the market's close). The focus will be on the social media giant's ad revenues and daily active users, but the current Zacks Consensus EPS estimate is $1.13 on $8.4 billion in revenues. This compares to EPS of $0.59 on $5.8 billion in revenues in the year-earlier period. Estimates have modestly inched up in recent days. The stock has performed in-line with the Zacks Tech sector since November 8th, up +6.3% vs. +6.1%.Thursday - 2/02/2017: On a busy reporting day with 35 index members coming out with Q4 results (23 in the morning & 12 after the market's close), the most notable report is fromAmazon(NASDAQ:AMZN-Free Report) in the evening.Amazon is expected to report $1.41 in earnings (up +41.5% year over year) on $44.8 billion in revenues (up +25.4% in revenues). Estimates have come down ahead of the earnings report, but Amazon has never really been an EPS story; it is all top-line growth, particularly gains in its cloud business, Amazon Web Services. Amazon has staked a well-regarded claim to leadership in the fast-growing cloud business. The stock has been a strong performer over the past year, up +31.4% vs. +12.4% gain for the Zacks Retail sector.Note:Sheraz Mian regularly provides earnings analysis on Zacks.com and appears frequently in the print and electronic media.

What's In Store for Apple ETFs This Earnings?;January 30, 2017, 09:19:00 AM EDT;"Technology giant AppleAAPLis set to release first-quarter fiscal 2017 results on January 31 after market close. Since Apple accounts for over 19% of the total market capitalization of the entire technology sector in the S&P 500 index, it is worth taking a look at its fundamentals ahead of results (read:5 ETF Investment Ideas for 2017).makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');Investors should note that Apple has been on an uptrend over the past three months, locking in gains of about 11%. In fact, the stock is currently within the striking distance of its 52-week high of $122.44. The upside might weaken as our proven model shows that the company has a lower probability of beating estimates this quarter. Additionally, the positive earnings estimate revision trend, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat, is absent for the stock.Inside Our MethodologyThe stock saw no earnings estimate revision over the past seven days or 30 days. Though AAPL's earnings surprise history is strong with a positive earnings surprise of 0.11% on average in the past four quarters, the stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and anEarnings ESPof -0.93% indicating lower chances of beating estimates this quarter (read:Bartosiak: Trading Apple's (AAPL) Earnings with Options).Betting on stocks that have a combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) usually leads to profits in an investor's portfolio. Our research shows that the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70% for the stocks with this combination. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with ourEarnings ESP FilterFurther, the stock has an ugly Industry Rank in the bottom 14% with an unimpressive Growth and Momentum Style Score of D and F, respectively, though a Value Style Score of B looks good. According to the analysts compiled by Zacks, Apple has an average target price of $132.10 with about 77% of the analysts having a Strong Buy or a Buy rating ahead of its earnings. This indicates an 8.3% upside to the current price of AAPL.What's Hot This Earnings Season?Apple had recorded its first annual revenue and profit decline in 15 years last fiscal year due to the saturation of the smartphone market. In addition, iPhone sales declined in the trailing three quarters. Analysts are expecting this trend to reverse with growth in both revenue and iPhone sales when it reports quarterly results (read:Will Q4 Earnings Strengthen Tech ETFs Further?).In fact, Apple is expected to have sold78 million iPhonesin first-quarter fiscal 2017, up from 75 million in the year-ago quarter, with revenues rising to $77.9 billion.As such, sales of the iPhone remained the major driver in the upcoming earnings report that will push up the stock price.ETFs on RadarGiven the above discussion, it is clear that sales is the most important metric this reporting cycle and that an earnings beat might be in store. As a result, investors' could definitely focus on ETFs having the largest allocation to the tech titan.While there are several ETFs in the space having Apple in their top 10 holdings, we have highlighted four funds that have Apple as their top firm. All these funds have a Zacks ETF Rank of 2 or 'Buy' rating with a Medium risk outlook (see:all the Technology ETFs here):iShares Dow Jones US Technology ETFIYW- The fund is up about 8% over the past three months and Apple makes up for 16.1% of the assets.Select Sector SPDR Technology ETFXLK- The fund added more than 7% in the same time frame and Apple accounts for 13.7% share.Vanguard Information Technology ETFVGT- It surged about 7.6%.

Mondays Vital Data: Facebook Inc (FB), Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN);January 30, 2017, 09:12:36 AM EDT;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsU.S. stock futures are pulling back this morning, as President Donald Trump's travel ban on immigrants from several predominantly Muslim countries cast doubts on further economic policies. The uncertainty has placed theDow Jones Industrial Average'stentative hold on 20,000 in question amid a flood of key corporate earnings this week.makeArticleAd();Heading into the open, futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average are off 0.3%, whileS&P 500futures have dropped 0.34% andNasdaq-100futures have fallen 0.35%.On the options front, volume arrived below average on Friday, as about 14.4 million calls and 13.6 million puts crossed the tape. Over on the CBOE, puts gained traction ahead of the weekend, as the single-session equity put/call volume ratio jumped to a one-month high of 0.73, forcing the 10-day moving average to tick higher to 0.66.Turning to Friday's volume leaders, earnings was the major driver for several large tech names on the top ten most active options listing.Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) reports after the close tomorrow afternoon, whileFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) will step into the limelight after the close on Wednesday. Finally, online retailing giantAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) joins the fray after the close on Thursday.Facebook Inc (FB)FB stock saw a wellspring of call option activity on Friday at a time when many traders were seeking protection ahead of the weekend. Total volume on the stock rose to 755,000 contracts, with calls snapping up an impressive 71% of the day's take.7 Stocks to Buy That Could Double by 2018Call buying was the order of the day, as traders appear to be anticipating a post-earnings rally from Facebook this Wednesday.Following Friday's close, the 3 Feb put/call open interest ratio slipped from 0.82 at the beginning of the session to 0.75 as calls were added at a faster rate than puts among options most affected by Facebook's quarterly report - implying rising expectations for a bullish post-earnings move. Implieds are still pricing in a move of about 5.3% for FB stock, with the upper bound lying at roughly $139.50 and the lower bound resting at $125.50.For the record, Facebook earnings are expected to rise nearly 66% to $1.31 per share, with sales soaring 45.4% to $8.49 billion. According toEarningsWhispers.com, the whisper number for Facebook's fourth-quarter comes in at $1.37 per share.Apple Inc (AAPL)iPhone maker Apple is also on tap to release its quarterly report this week. Analysts are expecting a year-over-year decline of about 2% for Apple earnings, down to $3.22 per share from $3.28 per share a year ago. Revenue is expected to creep 2% higher to $77.38 billion.Even speculative analysts remain reserved on Apple, asEarningsWhispers.comreports a whisper number of only $3.23 per share. That said, iPhone unit sales and guidance amid the current geopolitical climate could be the major drivers for any post-earnings reaction for AAPL stock.As such, options traders appear to be playing it close to the vest on AAPL. Friday's activity revealed a bit of trepidation, with calls accounting for a below-average 58% of the 637,000 contracts traded on Apple stock. The 3 Feb. options series also shows a bit of concern for AAPL's earnings reaction, with the put/call OI ratio coming in at 0.74, slightly above Apple's historic pre-earnings range nearer 0.70. Furthermore, peak 3 Feb. call OI rests at the in-the-money $120 strike, hinting at low expectations for AAPL stock.Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN)Last, but certainly not least, Amazon.com will release its fourth-quarter earnings report after the close on Thursday, and it looks like evenI underestimated AMZN stock's potential. Several retailers have already reported this quarter, blaming lower-than-expected sales figures on slowing foot traffic, mainly due to the rising dominance of online shopping - a market in which Amazon commands38% of the market share.How to Trade Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock After EarningsStill, AMNZ options traders appeared reluctant to jump on the bullish bandwagon on Friday. Total volume rose to 247,000 contracts, with calls only eking out 58% of the day's take.That said, peak call OI for the 3 Feb series totals 1,300 contracts at the deep out-of-the-money $900 strike, with another 1,200 contracts at the $870 strike. So, while volume remains a touch conservative, AMZN options traders still appear to have high expectations for a post-earnings rally.As of this writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 Stocks to Buy That Already Make America Great10 High-Yield Dividend Stocks That Are SOMEHOW Still BargainsThe postMonday's Vital Data: Facebook Inc (FB), Apple Inc.

(AAPL)Apple is in the midst of a controversial move that will limit the number of apps available to consumers in Iran.The company has reportedlybeen pulling Iranian appsfrom the App Store. The App Store was first opened in the Middle Eastern country a few months ago in September 2016.7 Awful Stocks You Need To Ditch Right AwayAt first, there were numerous restrictions governing the Store, but Apple was slowly removing these. However, a credible tech news site calledTechrasasaid an popular Iranian e-commerce service Digikala hadits app removed from the App Store.The app had more than a million users. One fact worth noting is that there is no official App Store for the territory of Iran, but many companies manage to sell their apps to consumers in Iran by registering their app as being outside the country.The country has about 40 million smartphones in use, which amounts to roughly half of the 82 million population using devices.AAPL shares have risen 5.3% year-to-date.BlackBerry Ltd (BBRY)BlackBerry is looking for one last hurrah in the smartphone industry with its Mercury device.The company has managed to survive going under by slowly transitioning from a hardware maker to a software provider. While the Mercuryisn't even technically manufactured by BlackBerry,the company still had a hand in the creation of device.The gadget recentlymade an appearanceinLast Man Standing, anABCsitcom starring Tim Allen. The actor's character - Michael Baxter - is seen rocking the Mercury ahead of the product's release.In fact, Baxter is seen using the phone several times and there are some close-ups that give the audience some idea of what it looks like when in use. BlackBerry's latest smartphone will be unveiled at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona next month.Allen is a fan of the company's phones, but it is unclear if the decision to use it on the show was his idea or a decision made by one of the producers.BBRY shares have slipped 5.4% over the past six months.Delta Air Lines, Inc.

Facebook Inc (FB) Stock: New All-Time Highs or New Problems?;January 30, 2017, 08:38:36 AM EDT;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) enters this week's fourth-quarter earnings report in a peculiar position: Despite the fact that FB stock is trading near all-time highs, Facebook absolutely has something to prove.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockThat's because FB has spent the past three months recovering from a rough Q3 report that sent the stock to one of its biggest dips since coming public in 2012. While the company reported a strong earnings beat, Facebook CFO warned about a slowdown in revenue growth for Q4, and said ad load might ""come down meaningfully"" in the second half of this year.The news sparked a selloff from which Facebook wouldn't really recover until the start of 2017. But recover it has - FB stock is up roughly 15% in the past month to trade near all-time highs around $113.So, what's in store for Facebook this time around?If you believe Jefferies analyst Brian Fitzgerald, FB could be sitting on the powder keg that sends Facebook through the price ceiling.Fitzgerald believes Instagram and mobile ad revenues will drive the business forward, and expects Q4 revenues to grow 46% year-over-year to $8.54 billion - slightly ahead of Wall Street's broader estimates for $8.5 billion. He also projects GAAP profits of $1.05, which are a penny higher than the consensus mark.""We remain particularly optimistic around Instagram, bottom-funnel ad units like DPAs, and Live video,"" says Fitzgerald, whose $175 price target represents 33% upside from here. ""While expense growth is a potential concern, FB has a history of under-promising and overdelivering in this area.""10 Stocks to Buy That Already Make America GreatIndeed, mobile is king for Facebook, which crossed the 1 billion mark for ""mobile only"" active users in Q3. In fact, 84% of the company's $6.82 billion in ad revenues came from mobile - up from 78% in the year-ago period. At about $5.7 billion, mobile ad sales came in more than 30% higher thantotalFacebook ad sales in Q3 2015.Still, if Facebook matches Wall Street's projections for 45.6% sales growth, that would be down both sequentially from Q3's 59% revenue expansion, and last Q4's 52% increase in sales. Which means investors will be looking for other areas of growth.They could get it in Facebook Live, the company's somewhat controversial live streaming service that has unwittingly exposed users to real-time torture and suicide videos. Still, CEO believes images and video are the future of Facebook - and the expansion and advertising of Live's services reflect that plenty.Facebook will need to show Wall Street something exciting, though, or FB could be in for its second straight quarterly tumble.Facebook shares reached all-time highs just above $133 in late October. They then dropped but rebounded to the $132 area, but were rejected following the Q3 earnings report. FB then was sent packing to the $114 level, which it fought several times before rebounding into the current rally.Now, Facebook stock finds itself challenging the $132-$133 area once more, but this time with an overbought Relative Strength Index (RSI) reading in the low 70s.And from a fundamental perspective, Facebook's forward price-to-earnings ratio of 25 isn't nearly on par with the likes of pricey Big Tech stocks such asNetflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX), but it's still a little lofty.At the very least, it'll be on investors' minds - especially if Facebook lays an egg Wednesday.More Earnings in FocusApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Jan. 31:When Apple reports fiscal Q1 earnings this Tuesday, Wall Street expects the iPhone maker to finally snap its short streak of consecutive revenue declines with a small 2% uptick in sales. Earnings, however, are expected to shrink slightly, by about 2% to $3.22 per share. Naturally, the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus will be in focus - Q1 covers the holiday season, which typically accounts for the year's biggest chunk of the iPhone revenue pie.However, Macquarie Capital's Ben Schachter thinks Services - which includes the App Store and AppleCare -might be the star of this show:""The oft underestimated and misunderstood Services segment has the potential to drive ~100 bps [=1%] of overall gross margin expansion per year for Apple. However, if one believes that iPhone units can grow with iPhone 8 and then be roughly stable going forward, we believe Services and Apps will become the growth engine for Apple.""Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Feb. 2:Amazon, on the other hand, is expected to keep up its torrid growth numbers when it reports Q4 earnings on Thursday. Profits are expected to improve by 35% to $1.35 per share, while revenues should surge 25% to $44.67 billion. Numerous brick-and-mortar retailers reported difficult holiday seasons, hinting at more gains for the ubiquitous e-tailer.How to Trade Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock After EarningsAlso promising is a note from Cowen analyst John Blackledge, who says Prime has ""maintained healthy growth."" He pointed toward a Cowen survey suggesting that Amazon Prime's customer base has grown 22% year-over-year to 50 million.

Heres How Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Can Reclaim Its Throne;January 30, 2017, 08:30:58 AM EDT;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) has its day of reckoning fast approaching. Tim Cook has turned out to be a game manager for AAPL stock. That's not a slight against him, but a game manager comes in when your first-string QB is out for a quarter or two. The problem is that Apple needs a visionary. There's no replacing Steve Jobs, and being a game manager in a sector that moves like lightning is not what the company needs.makeArticleAd();Source:Yuanbin Du Via FlickrAAPL stock generates almost 70% of revenue from the iPhone, and that product is seeing increasing competition.The good news is that Apple has well over $200 billion in cash and investments. It can literally do anything it wants. The problem is that most of that cash is stuck overseas - although that may change under Trump - and what Cook might do with that cash is a mystery.Without a vision, Apple would probably have to make acquisitions in rapidly growing companies. However, there is one other area that AAPL stock can venture into, one that I've been saying it must get into: original content.7 Stocks to Buy That Could Double by 2018News has surfaced that AAPL is finally looking seriously at creating original TV and film content. For years, Apple has begged off of this direction. It seemed content to play around with music streaming, and licensing content from other providers for iTunes.TheWSJreported:""The technology giant has been in talks with veteran producers in recent months about buying rights to scripted television programs. It also has approached experienced marketing executives at studios and networks to discuss hiring them to promote its content, said people with knowledge of the discussions. In addition to TV, Apple indicated to these people that it is considering offering original movies, though those plans are more preliminary. Executives at Apple have told people in Hollywood they hope to start offering original scripted content by the end of 2017.""The apple is ripe for AAPL to get involved, and in a very big way. We've seen thatNetflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX) has shifted its model toward original programming and is producing really great stuff. So isAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN). YouTube Red, though, is kind of floundering right now.One thing people want is not only more content, but good content. Because Apple is so flush with cash, it can literally do anything in this arena. There is a ton of talent out there, and so many models to play with for AAPL stock.Obviously, Apple would want to create high quality TV and film, and could do so across all genres. It wouldn't even have to be an issue of streaming content alone. If Apple wanted, it could produce feature films, and buy out any of the existing movie theatre chains and rebrand it as an Apple Theatre experience, and drop in all manner of synergies like this.The concept of the ""long tail"" is still very much in play, so creating independent work for a price, or returning to a version of the old studio system might also yield rewards. Yet there are other models, such as mining new talent from film schools and user-generated genius that's all over the place.The emerging technology of VR is another place to stretch. The ability to curate fully engaging experiences via VR, and developing technology that allows players to wear bodysuits permitting them to actually experience touch in these games is the next frontier.Can Apple Inc. (AAPL) Afford a War With Qualcomm, Inc. (QCOM)?And Apple has the money for it. It could become a multi-platform creator of content, and be able to engage people from all over the world.Is this is a blockbuster revenue generator for Apple stock? It's way too early to tell. However, having a vision that extends the concept of ""content"" to things like VR and more ""experiential"" content, could mean becoming the first mover in a whole new generation of entertainment. That is priceless.Lawrence Meyers is the CEO of PDL Capital, and manager of the forthcomingLiberty Portfolio stock newsletter. As of this writing, has no position in any stock mentioned.

LM Ericsson Sets Sail With a New Captain;January 30, 2017, 08:10:00 AM EDT;"Telecom-equipment makerTelefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson(NASDAQ: ERIC) reported fourth-quarter results on Thursday   morning. Share prices rose more than 3% that day.Ericsson's fourth-quarter results: The raw numbersMetricQ4 2016makeArticleAd();Q4 2015Year-Over-Year ChangeRevenue$7.2 billion$8.7 billion(17%)Net income($177 million)$823 millionN/AOperating cash flow$2.1 billion$2.6 billion(17%)Adjusted EPS (diluted)$0.07$0.29(76%)Data source:Ericsson. Financial results reported in Swedish crowns, converted to   average exchange rates of $0.11 USD per SEK in Q4 of 2016 and   $0.12 USD per SEK in the 2015 period.What happened with Ericsson this quarter?This was a tumultuous quarter for the Swedish telecom   infrastructure veteran.Borje Ekholm took the CEO office shortly after the end of     the fourth quarter. Interim CEO Jan Frykhammar stepped down,     but will remain on Ericsson's board of directors. Frykhammar's     team of advisors, including interim CFO Carl Mellander and     executive vice president Magnus Mandersson, will stay in place     to give Ekholm guidance and continuity. That's the end of the     aftermath of former CEO Hans Vestberg's seven-year reign.A large chunk of the sales decline came from a tough     comparison against the year-ago period. In that quarter,Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) signed a patent licensing agreement with     Ericsson that settled all litigation between the companies --     and temporarily added nearly $500 million to Ericsson's top     line.On top of the Apple effect, all three of Ericsson's     reportable segments delivered lower sales and smaller operating     profits on a year-over-year basis. However, network hardware     sales increase 33% sequentially and drove global service     revenues 15% higher, thanks to strong order volumes in several     key markets.Image source: Ericsson.Ericsson's management did not provide firm guidance targets   for the coming quarter or fiscal year. Instead, they said that   markets would stay ""tough"" in 2017, putting pressure on sales   expectations. Gross margins are expected to improve in the second   half of 2017, ending a negative streak that started in the spring   of 2016.What management had to sayIn aconference callwith Wall Street analysts, Ekholm provided a reminder of what   Ericsson is all about. Investors might see this note as a call to   arms, getting back to the nuts and bolts of running a   multinational technology business. Ekholm said:We are in a technology industry. We need to be technology     leaders and stay at the forefront of the technology     development. Ericsson has a unique set of assets with our     products but we also have services and solutions, and that     package creates a unique position for us to compete in the     market. That's something we need to leverage, but it's also     something we continuously need to invest in and develop.Looking aheadWith degrees in electrical engineering and economics and 10   years of service on Ericsson's board of directors, Ekholm seems   exceptionally qualified for his new job. Vestberg is moving   on to lead Sweden's Olympic committee, including efforts to host   the Winter Games in 2026.Ekholm is widely expected to restructure Ericsson around the   next generation of mobile technology, known as 5G, alongside   support for cloud computing and the Internet of Things. It's less   obvious where he will start slashing Ericsson's efforts and   expenses in order to achieve that sharper focus. Ekholm   reportedly started making the rounds among Ericsson's top   customers in North America, Asia, and Europe as soon as he was   selected, giving him a three-month head start.Starting in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, Ericsson   will report results in three new segments: networks, media, and   IT and cloud.10 stocks we like better than Telefonaktiebolaget LM     EricssonWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Cirrus Logic (CRUS) to Report Q3 Earnings: What's in Store?;January 30, 2017, 07:50:00 AM EDT;"Cirrus Logic Inc.CRUSis set to report third-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Feb 1. Last quarter, the company recorded a positive earnings surprise of 30.5%. Let's see how things are shaping up for this quarter.Factors to ConsiderCirrus Logic is a premier supplier of high-performance analog circuits and advanced mixed-signal chip solutions. The company posted better-than-expected second-quarter fiscal 2017 results.  The year-over-year comparisons on both the counts were also favorable.Notably, as per revenue segments, Portable audio product revenues accounted for approximately 89% of the total revenue last quarter. Also, Cirrus Logic generates a significant portion of its revenues from Apple Inc.AAPL. This means that there is always a risk of losing an Apple design contract, which will significantly hurt the company's financials.We remain cautious about the company as the current global economic downturn might have an impact on its performance in the soon-to-be reported quarter. Moreover, the company faces competition from the likes of Texas Instruments Inc. and STMicroelectronics, which remains a headwind.Nonetheless, continued investments in the audio segment are expected to have a positive impact in the long run. Additionally, synergies from acquisitions and expansion in the LED market continue to drive growth.Cirrus Logic, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseCirrus Logic, Inc.

3 Things to Watch in the Stock Market This Week;January 29, 2017, 03:30:00 PM EDT;"Stocks rose by a full percentage point last week, buoyed by a   strong initial crop of earnings reports. With that gain, theDow Jones Industrial Average(DJINDICES: ^DJI) and theS&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC)  indexes are both up by about 2% so far in   2017 after rising by double-digits last year.^DJIdata byYCharts.makeArticleAd();Earnings seasons ramps up over the week ahead as hundreds of   companies post results for the final quarter of 2016. A few of   the most anticipated reports will come fromUnder Armour(NYSE: UAA) (NYSE: UA) ,Facebook(NASDAQ: FB) , andApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) .Apple goes for growthApple shares are back at all-time highs heading into Tuesday's   report, which is expected to show that the consumer electronics   titanreturned to sales growthfollowing three consecutive quarters of declines.iPhone SE. Image source: Apple.Apple's iPhone business accounts for almost two-thirds of   sales, and so investors will be keen to know how the franchise   did over the critical holiday quarter. At its last quarterly   check-in, iPhone unit sales fell by 5% and average selling prices   declined as well. Those trends should improve to overall growth   this quarter due to healthy demand for the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7   Plus.Other data points worth watching will be gross profit margin,   which CEO Tim Cook and his executive team forecast to decrease   slightly to 38% of sales. Meanwhile, management has highlighted   Apple's growing recurring revenue stream lately, including the   24% boost in its services segment last quarter. Yet the company's   outlook for the coming quarter is likely to grab the most   attention from investors, as it will imply either a return to   shrinking sales or accelerating growth ahead.Facebook's advertising volumeInvestorsweren't thrilledwith social media giant Facebook's last quarterly report. Its   operating results showed rock-solid growth, though, with revenue   spiking 56% due to an almost-60% jump in advertising sales. Its   massive base of daily active users also rose 17% to 1.18 billion   as average revenue per user crossed the $4 mark worldwide.Yet the stock declined as Wall Street fretted about an   upcoming slowdown. ""Expect to see ad revenue growth rates come   down meaningfully,"" executives warned in early November. That's   no surprise, given that advertising has jumped at a 50% pace over   the past few years.The company doesn't have much more room to increase the volume   of ads that it drops into users' timelines, though, and so   further gains will likely come from things like increased   engagement, which don't pack the same punch as scaled-up   delivery. That's why this week's focus will likely be on how   management sees its advertising trends changing as the segment   matures.Under Armour needs a winThere's a disconnect between Under Armour's business and its   stock price heading into Tuesday's report. Its awesome expansion   streak makes it one of the fastest-growing companies in the   S&P 500, and yet it was among the worst-performing stocks in   the index last year.The sports-apparel specialist could resolve that tension by   posting accelerating sales gains along with firmer profitability   this week. However, CEO Kevin Plank and his executive team aren't   predicting a rebound in either area.Image source: Getty Images.In fact, sales growth is likely to stay at just above 20% this   quarter and for the foreseeable future, marking a slowdown from   the 30% pace it enjoyed as recently as the first quarter of 2016.   A surprise slowdown in the U.S. market is offsetting gains   internationally to keep Under Armour's growth pace about even   with executives' goals.What's really unnerved investors is the fact that   profitability has declined to itslowest level on recordas the company drives deeper into athletic shoe sales and spends   aggressively to defend market share in the U.S. Those shifts   convinced management to lower their earnings outlook through 2018   while preserving their long-term bullishness on the industry.   This week's report might produce a large stock price swing if it   alters those broad expectations in either direction.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

How Skyworks Solutions Inc Is Growing Beyond Apple;January 29, 2017, 01:45:00 PM EDT;"Image source: Skyworks Solutions.Skyworks Solutions(NASDAQ: SWKS) investors couldn't have asked for a better start   to its fiscal 2017. A first quarterearnings beatand a stronger outlook for the ongoing quarter sent its stock   soaring to new 52-week highs, as it rose over 13% in a single   day.makeArticleAd();For the fiscal second quarter, Skyworks believes that its   revenue will grow 8% year-over-year to $840 million, exceeding   the consensus forecast of $818 million, while earnings of $1.40   per share should significantly outpace analyst estimates of $1.24   per share.Skyworks also delivered some solid long-term takeaways in its   latest quarter. The company is now boasting of design wins at   high-volume smartphone companies in China, as it is growing its   revenue outside ofApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) . Still, Apple reportedly contributed 40% of   Skyworks' top line in fiscal 2016.However, the company has been gradually working toward winning   more business from other clients, and it has found some   success.Growing beyond AppleSkyworks' business outside of Apple increased 8% in the last   fiscal year, as Vivek Arya of Merrill Lynch pointed out on the   latest conference call. Though this might not seem really big   right now, the fact that overall revenue fell 1.3% year-over-year   in the first quarter makes the growth beyond Apple a crucial   factor for long-term success.In fiscal 2015, Apple wasreportedly44% of Skyworks' business. Thus, it can be assumed that of   Skyworks' total revenue of $927 million in the first quarter of   2016, Apple contributed about $408 million of that. By   comparison, the smartphone giant should have contributed $366   million to Skyworks' revenue (40% of $914 million) in the most   recently reported quarter. This indicates that revenue from Apple   fell about 10% year-over-year.That indicates Skyworks' growth from other clients powered its   revenue and earnings beat last quarter. This is why Skyworks   needs to aggressively pursue client diversification if it wants   to mitigate the slowdown in business with Apple.Diversifying in the right areasSkyworks Solutions is building an army of clients in China.   One of the most prominent names is Huawei. The company has been   supplying its SkyBlue technology to the Chinese smartphone maker   for its flagship Mate 9 smartphone. In fact, according to   Skyworks CEO Liam Griffin, Huawei is now the company's second   biggest client.This is a big deal for Skyworks since Huawei is now a   formidable name in the smartphone industry. According to the   latest data available from IDC, Huawei's smartphone market share   stood at 9.3%, trailingSamsung's 21% share and Apple's 12.5% share in the third quarter of   2016. More importantly, the Chinese smartphone giant has been   selling more of its high and mid-range phones, which account for   57% of its total shipments.With a higher share of Huawei's sales being driven by premium   and mid-range devices, it has been able to increase the average   selling price of its phones. When the company had released its   2015 results, its average selling price of smartphones was up 17%   to $204 per unit. Though the company has not released 2016   numbers yet, Huawei is capable of increasing its selling prices   once again as it has been introducing its flagship phones in   global markets.The higher average selling price, along with higher volumes,   is good news for Skyworks since it will be able to enhance its   dollar content in Huawei devices, which are in turn enjoying   higher selling prices. Market research firm TrendForce   points out that smartphone production will increase 4.5% this   year to 1.4 billion units. Chinese smartphone companies will   account for 634 million units of this production, with Oppo,   Vivo, and Huawei being the biggest names. As Skyworks counts all   three of them as clients, it will witness a rise in chip sales   this year as the top Chinese smartphone companies are expected to   sell 39% more phones in 2017 as compared to 2016.Therefore, higher component demand by Chinese companies to   make more smartphones will push up Skyworks' average selling   prices, since it should be able to charge a premium in the wake   of tight supply. Skyworks can also make up for the volumes that   it is losing due to Apple's slowing iPhone sales, as it can now   sell more components to Chinese smartphone makers.Moving beyond mobileSkyworks' opportunities beyond mobile. Image Source:     Skyworks Solutions.The great thing about Skyworks is that it is pursuing   opportunities beyond mobile as well. The Internet of Things, or   IoT, is one such opportunity where the company is aggressively   enhancing its presence by launching new offerings.Skyworks released new front-end connectivity modules for   machine-to-machine connectivity and IoT operations a few weeks   ago. With its latest IoT product, Skyworks should be able to   accelerate the deployment of IoT applications by encouraging   migration from 2G networks due to its low cost and compact   packaging.This product development move by Skyworks is a smart one,   since the number of cellular devices communicating with each   other will rise from 300 million at present to around two billion   by 2020, according to GSMA. As the number of machine-to-machine   connections increases, Skyworks' connectivity modules that enable   the IoT will gain more traction and lead to higher shipment   volumes.However, the company does not single out its revenue or   shipments from the IoT segment, or any segment for that matter.   But the sheer growth in the size of this market, coupled with the   company's product development efforts, should prove to be a   tailwind in the long run.The Foolish takeawaySkyworks revenue is expected to increase 8.7% in the current   fiscal year, followed by stronger growth of 10.5% next year. It   appears to be pulling the right strings to diversify its revenue   away from heavily concentrated clients such as Apple, which seems   to have hit its ownroadblocks. As a result, Skyworks is well-positioned for long-term success   as it focuses on markets that have significant room for growth   versus areas approaching saturation.10 stocks we like better than Skyworks     SolutionsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Apple Stock Has a Lot to Prove on Tuesday;January 29, 2017, 10:07:00 AM EDT;"Image source: The Motley Fool.One of the biggest earnings reports this week will beApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) . The world's most valuable consumer tech company   will be reporting its fiscal first quarter results after the   market close on Tuesday, and it wouldn't be a surprise if the   numbers move bothApple stockand the market in general.makeArticleAd();Apple stock hit a fresh 52-week high on Thursday, and with the   shares trading 36% off their springtime lows, it's easy to see   how proving mortal can trigger a sell-off. The silver lining here   is that just a sliver of its gains have come in the past three   months. Apple shares have risen a mere 3% since its last   quarterly report.Wall Street pros aren't holding out for much. They see $77.38   billion in revenue for the holiday quarter, just 2% more than   what Apple scored during the prior year's holiday quarter.   Analysts are also forecasting a profit of $3.22 a share, just   below the $3.28 Apple delivered a year earlier.Grate expectationsIf a 2% uptick in revenue and a 2% dip in earnings per share   seem uninspiring, keep in mind that three months ago we saw   revenue and earnings slide 9% and 15%, respectively, during   Apple's fiscal fourth quarter. A huge decline in China and a   modest slide in the Americas couldn't be overcome by smaller   gains in Europe and Japan. Apple's 24% surge in services revenue   was the lone bright spot, and no match for selling fewer iPhones,   iPads, and Macs.Bulls will argue that Tuesday's report will feature the first   full quarter of availability for the iPhone 7 and Apple Watch   Series 2 after their September debuts, but it was also when the   iPhone 6s came out a year earlier. The prior year was also the   first holiday season of Apple Watch availability.Unfortunately for Apple, Wall Street's gotten better at   forecasting its financial performances. Apple used to routinely   blast through analyst profit targets with ease when the iPad was   new and the iPhone was all the rage during the early years of the   mobile revolution. They're getting closer to the truth these   days. Apple hasn't topped Wall Street profit estimates by more   than 3% over the past year, and that's with the benefit of   aggressive share buybacks propping up profitability on a   per-share basis. Apple's outstanding share count has declined in   each of the past four years.Analysts who have chimed in with updates in the days leading   up to Tuesday's report have been mixed. Mark Moskowitz at   Barclays downgraded Apple from ""overweight"" to ""equal weight,""   concerned about the upside for all of 2017. He lowered his price   target from $119 to $117, below where the stock is at now.Credit Suisseanalyst Kulbinder Garcha checked in a day later with a more   upbeat take, but his ""outperform"" rating and $150 price goal is   based more on the potential of the hyped-up iPhone 8 that should   be released later this year than anything that we will see in   Tuesday's report.One can argue that the scene is set for Apple to shine.   Analysts are looking beyond the fiscal first quarter, and the   stock hasn't kept up with the market since its last quarterly   report. After three quarters of year-over-year revenue declines,   even a token increase could give investors a chance to exhale.   The continuing growth of services revenue could ultimately get   net margins moving in the right direction again. We won't have to   wait long to see what Mr. Market thinks.

Will Lawsuits Force Apple, Inc. To Prevent Texting And Driving?;January 29, 2017, 10:00:00 AM EDT;"Distracted driving is a big and growing problem. In 2014,   3,179 Americans were killed in traffic accidents involving   drivers diverting their attention to activities like eating,   talking on their phone, or texting. It's the third most deadly   factor in modern car accidents, behind only drunk driving and   speeding.You'll be delighted to hear that iPhone makerApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) has patented a way to reduce this menace. But the   patented solution is not yet implemented on any of Apple's   devices.What gives? Let's have a look.makeArticleAd();What's new?Last week, a survivor of a distracted-driving incident filed a   class action lawsuit against Apple. The suit is not seeking a big   payout from Cupertino. Instead, it calls for an injunction   against sales of Apple devices in California until the company   implements its patented prevention method against texting and   driving on devices both new and already sold.""If texting and driving is a vessel of trouble, Apple is the   captain of the ship,"" the court filing states. ""The company   enjoys 40 percent of the smartphone market share -- far more than   the nearest competitor. And its profits are enormous. Fortune   Magazine reports that in the third quarter of 2016, Apple   generated 91% of the smartphone market's profits, equating to a   cool $8.5 billion in net profit -- or about $95 million in profit   per day.""So the suit argues that Apple plays a significant part in the   distracted driving problem, and has both a responsibility and the   financial wherewithal to do something about it. Indeed, there is   a tool on the table. The filing cites an Applepatentfor disabling a mobile device when its motion sensors and other   systems detect patterns consistent with driving a car. Filed in   2008, when the ancientiPhone 3Gwas brand new, and approved by the Patent Office in 2014, Apple   has had an eye on this issue since the very beginning of its   smartphone exploits.But again, nearly three years after that patent got an   official approval, the technology remains unused.This lawsuit is not the first legal challenge to cite Apple's   anti-distraction patent. It's just the first one that primarily   wants to force Apple's hand into doing something with this   allegedly life-saving technology. Others have been more concerned   with cash payments for damage done by iPhone-wielding   drivers.Image source: US Patent and Trademark Office.Why isn't Apple using this patent yet?Many fully granted patents never see the light of day in a   real-world implementation. This particular one could be among   those for a variety of good reasons. For example:Apple could be working on a better solution than the one     described in the '143 patent, but the new and improved solution     isn't ready for a date with the Patent Office yet.The company might have found flaws in its original     technology, which was developed and filed at a time when     smartphones were a poorly understood novelty. Real-world     experience and deeper research could have changed Apple's     design requirements in a hurry.Other companies may have unveiled better solutions for the     dangers of distracted driving, perhaps as part of efforts to     come up with fully automated driving platforms. Nearly every     major auto maker is on board with theautonomous drivingtrend now, alongside plenty of technology experts. I'd be     surprised to learn that Apple's efforts from way back in 2008     provided a better solution than what all of Detroit and Silicon     Valley could whip up nearly a decade later.That's just scratching the surface of about a zillion reasons   not to take a patented technology to market. I'm sure that Apple   will come up with many more if the lawsuit ever hits a   courtroom.Image source: Apple.What's next?No, I don't think that Apple will ever actually implement this   particular deterrent to texting and driving. Lawsuits won't   change that. Halting iPhone sales in California would be a   powerful incentive, but Apple's top-shelf legal eagles can surely   head that threat off at the pass. However, the fact that   consumers are standing up to ask Apple for help with this   conundrum could accelerate Apple's arrival at a more complete   solution.The company must balance the benefits of a life-saving safety   feature against the risk that users might find the new   restrictions too overbearing. If your phone came with opt-in   restrictions on how you can use it in the driver's seat of a car,   would you enable them? If not, you'd be part of the problem.   Therefore, this is the kind of feature that needs to be forced on   the user with no obvious way to turn it off. Otherwise, the   change is not likely to make a difference.Apple obviously doesn't want to push any of its loyal users   over to Android and other platforms, where they can continue   their risky behavior unfettered. Ideally, the smartphone industry   would come together and push out protection against texting and   driving. No fuss, no muss, and thousands of lives potentially   saved. Top-down regulations would also do the trick, but that   solution would also elicit pained groans of heavy-handed rules   from every company in the mobile industry.There may not be a real solution to the distracted driving   problem until self-driving cars go mainstream. Until then,   lawsuits and concerned users can only hope to turn Apple's   smartphone designs in a safer direction.Don't hold your breath.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Better Buy: Skyworks Solutions Inc. vs. Infinera;January 28, 2017, 03:46:00 PM EDT;"Investing in the tech sector can be tricky. Competition     tends to be fierce, which makes it difficult to stay one step     ahead. Two companies that have a strong history of maintaining     their edge areSkyworks Solutions(NASDAQ: SWKS)  andInfinera(NASDAQ: INFN) . Both of these businesses have been taking     market share in their industries for years, which is     impressive. But which of these two tech companies is the better     investment today? Let's review the bull thesis for each company     so we can make an informed decision.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();The case for Skyworks SolutionsSkyworks designs and builds chips that allow devices to   connect to each other. The company's semiconductors are found in   a wide range of products such as routers, tablets, cars, and   smartphones.While this industry is quite competitive, Skyworks' unique   ability to create custom and complex solutions for its customers   has given it a big edge over rivals. In fact, Skyworks chips can   currently be found in nearly all of the top-selling smartphones   in the world, including those made bySamsung, Xiaomi, andApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) .The massive boom in smartphone sales over the last few   years has been a godsend for Skyworks. The company's revenue,   margins, and profits have all soared, which has taken long-term   investors on a lucrative ride.SWKSdata byYChartsWith the Internet of Things ramping up and 5G technology set   to deploy, Skyworks looks well positioned to continue delivering   for investors from here. However, Skyworks does have   an Achilles heel that investors should be aware of.   Apple is responsible for more than 40% of Skyworks' total   revenue, which is a blessing and a curse. When iPhone sales are   booming, Skyworks' results soar. However, when the Mac maker   decides to reduce its channel inventory, Skyworks reallyfeels the pain.While Skyworks has been signing deals in recent years to help   reduce its customer concentration, Apple is such a huge component   of Skyworks revenue that these two companies will remain attached   at the hip -- for better or worse -- for the foreseeable   future.The case for InfineraInfinera is a fast growing player in the   optical networking equipment market. The company's products   make internet providers lives easier by allowing them to easily   (and cheaply) move vast quantities of data around the globe.Like Skyworks, Infinera has also benefited from a number of   tech trends. The rise of cloud computing and streaming high-def   video is making it difficult for providers to keep up with   demand. That's forcing them to invest huge sums of money to   expand their networks, which has been a boon to Infinera's   business.Image source: Getty Images.That's a wonderful backdrop, but Infinera hasstruggledover the last few quarters to translate that bandwidth   demand growth into financial success. While there are several   factors to blame, one of the biggest problems is   competition.Ciena-- a much larger rival -- has caught up to Infinera's   technological edge and has been eating the company's lunch as of   late. While Infinera's management is aware of the problem and is   investing heavily to recapture its edge, it might be a long-haul   until the company returns to top-line growth.Of course, those worries have now beenpriced into the company's stock, so investors could be in a position to win big if the company   can grow faster than market watchers expect.The better buyWhile I'm hopeful that Infinera can right its ship, there are   never any guarantees of success. For that reason, I think that   the better choice for investors today is Skyworks. Not only does   Skyworks promise high growth rates ahead, but it is already so   profitable that it pays out a fast-growing dividend and still   has enough cash left over tobuy back boatloads of stock. As long as the company can continue to make progress at fixing   its customer concentration issues, then its future is looking   quite bright.10 stocks we like better than Skyworks     SolutionsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

The Chronological History of How Qualcomm Became the Most Powerful Apple Supplier Ever;January 28, 2017, 12:00:00 PM EDT;"Image source: Apple.If you read throughApple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) blockbuster lawsuit againstQualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM) , there's quite a bit of animosity toward how   Qualcomm conducted its business with Apple over the years. This   was not a pleasant relationship -- at least according to   Apple.makeArticleAd();Instead, this relationship was skewed significantly in favor   of Qualcomm, and there wasn't a whole lot that Apple could do   since the iPhone fundamentally relies on cellular connectivity.   This is easily the only time that Apple has not had the upper   hand with a supplier relationship. Look no further than Apple's   ownnegotiating tacticswith now-defunct GT Advanced to see how hard Apple could squeeze   its suppliers. Yet Qualcomm was able to become the most powerful   Apple supplier ever.This story has at least a decade of history that you need to   know to fully appreciate why Apple felt desperate enough to sue.   ""I've always hated litigation and I continue to hate it,"" said   CEO Tim Cook in 2014, so we know Apple isn't trigger-happy when   it comes to suing. The Mac maker simply had enough. Note that   what follows is largely Apple's side, as laid out in the   complaint. Qualcomm will of course offer a different   perspective.That being said, let's start from the beginning.2007: Apple introduces the original iPhoneMuch of Qualcomm's patent portfolio is considered essential to   cellular standards that enable modern mobile devices to connect   to cellular networks, which is the foundation of its licensing   business. Standards-essential patents (SEPs) must be licensed to   anyone, including competitors, at fair, reasonable, and   non-discriminatory (FRAND) rates.Apple initially sourced baseband modems from Infineon, which   was subsequently acquired byIntel, for the first four years. Even before Apple ever bought its   first Qualcomm baseband, it had to pay licensing fees indirectly   through its contract manufacturers. Apple attempted to negotiate   a direct license with Qualcomm, but was unable to, according to   its complaint:Apple has been indirectly paying Qualcomm licensing fees     since 2007, when it released the iPhone....In 2007, Apple released the first iPhone using Intel (then     Infineon) baseband processor chipsets. Qualcomm required     licensing fees for using these chipsets. Rather than grant     Apple a direct license on FRAND terms, Qualcomm has instead     entered into confidential licenses with specific Apple contract     manufacturers (""CMs""), the third-party manufacturers who make     and assemble Apple products. The CMs pay the exorbitant     royalties Qualcomm demands and pass the costs along to Apple in     full.As a way to get relief on excessive royalties, Apple entered   into a ""Marketing Incentive Agreement"" with Qualcomm in 2007 that   prohibited it from marketing WiMAX devices, an emerging 4G   standard that would compete with LTE -- and which Qualcomm lacks   meaningful patents for. Obviously, if Apple can't market a   device, it won't make said device. While this was before Apple   became a major player in the smartphone market, this agreement   certainly contributed to WiMAX's death.It was around 2007 that Qualcomm allegedly stopped licensing   its SEPs to rivals, and began charging separately for licenses.   This violated thepatent exhaustion doctrineof patent law.Around 2007, Qualcomm's practice of licensing its     FRAND-encumbered cellular SEPs to competitors changed. In 2006,     Qualcomm's 10-K stated that it entered into ""License     Agreements"" with competing chipset manufacturers, and received     royalties thereunder. In Qualcomm's 2007 10-K, the term     ""License Agreements"" was replaced by ""Agreements."" Qualcomm's     2008 10-K provided that in ""every case, these agreements do not     allow such integrated circuit suppliers to pass through rights     under Qualcomm's patents to such suppliers' customers, and such     customers' sales of CDMA-based wireless subscriber device into     which such suppliers' integrated circuits are incorporated are     subject to the payment of royalties to us in accordance     with the customers' separate licensing arrangements with     us.""...Since at least 2007, Qualcomm has engaged in systematic,     continuous conduct to exclude competition in the relevant     chipset markets.2008: Turmoil in the baseband marketIn January,Analog Devicesexited the baseband market by selling its baseband business to   MediaTek for $350 million in cash. MediaTek was one of the few   remaining baseband companies.In October, Freescale announced that it was discontinuing   all mobile chips, including basebands, RF transceivers, and   more.2009: Joint ventures, negotiations, and regulatory   actionsEricssonandSTMicroelectronicsformed a joint venture, ST-Ericsson, in order to target the   mobile market, including basebands, among other chips.Knowing that it wanted to eventually release an iPhone that   could connect to CDMA networks, Apple started to lay the   foundation of procuring baseband chipsets from Qualcomm in the   near future. Incredibly, Apple was unable to get Qualcomm to   commit to its supply requirements, a standard ask of prospective   suppliers. On the contrary, Qualcomm specifically retained the   right to withhold chips as leverage.The 2009 Strategic Terms Agreement (""STA"") addresses the     process by which Qualcomm supplies chipsets and associated     software to Apple. It also restricts Apple's ability to sue     Qualcomm for patent infringement concerning Qualcomm chipsets.     While Apple generally negotiates firm supply commitments with     its component vendors, Qualcomm refused to provide Apple such a     commitment, instead arbitrarily capping its liability for     failure to supply, and reserving for itself the ability to     terminate its obligation to supply chipsets to Apple's CMs.     Qualcomm's unilateral right to terminate supply of chipsets to     Apple's CMs was retained in the Amended and Restated Strategic     Terms Agreement (""ASTA""), effective February 28, 2013.During this year, Qualcomm also found itself subject to   regulatory investigations in both Japan and South Korea over its   shenanigans.The Japan Fair Trade Commission (""JFTC"") has been     investigating Qualcomm since 2006. In September 2009, the JFTC     concluded that Qualcomm violated the Japanese Antimonopoly Act     by forcing licensees to cross-license their patents on a     royalty-free basis and agree to a non-assert provision, and     ordered the company to cease these practices....In July 2009, the KFTC levied the largest fine it had ever     imposed on a company -- $207 million -- on Qualcomm for abusing     its dominant share of the CDMA chipset market.Note that this 2009 Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) fine is   separate from another one that the KFTC just imposed a few weeks   ago.2011: Apple launches the iPhone on Verizon, and Qualcomm's   exclusivity beginsThis was a big one. In many ways, this was the year that Apple   fullygot into bed with Qualcomm, largely becauseVerizon's 3G network uses CDMA instead of GSM. As the largest U.S.   carrier, it was an important strategic move for Apple ahead of   the scheduled end ofAT&Texclusivity. Fully aware of this, Qualcomm flexed its licensing   muscles:Apple became even more reliant on Qualcomm in 2011 due to     Apple's desire to release an iPhone that could connect to CDMA     networks, such as Verizon's....Since 2011, when Apple introduced the first CDMA version of     its products, Qualcomm has charged Apple a monopolistic premium     for access to CDMA chipsets that are in all other respects     identical to chipsets sold to Apple without CDMA functionality     enabled. Qualcomm prices its CDMA chipsets without regard to     competitive alternatives.Qualcomm's exclusivity in supplyingallbaseband chipsets began in 2011. Seeking relief from excessive   royalties, Qualcomm gave Apple rebates that were contingent upon,   among other things, exclusivity. We're talking about billions of   dollars:Specifically, since 2011, Qualcomm has conditioned billions     of dollars in rebates on exclusivity or de facto exclusivity     from Apple.This exclusivity ended just a few months ago, with Intel   coming on board as a second supplier. The timing of this lawsuit   is surely not a coincidence.NVIDIAannounced in May that it is acquiring Icera's baseband and RF   assets for $367 million, with the hopes of both addressing the   baseband market as well as integrating cellular connectivity into   its new Tegra line of mobile chips.2012: Bye, TIAfter deciding to exit the baseband market four years prior,Texas Instrumentscontinued its plannedexit of the mobile chip market. TI discontinued its OMAP applications processors, and kept   ratcheting down its baseband business. TI had still been   making baseband for a few prominent customers, but now planned to   wind them down completely by year's end.2013: Another agreement, another exit, and another regulatory   investigationApple kicked off 2013 with a new Business Cooperation and   Patent Agreement (BCPA) that took effect on the first day of the   year. This was simply an agreement intended in part to provide   royalty relief. This BCPA also had the provision that Apple could   not instigate or induce any regulatory investigations, although   Apple was allowed to cooperate if approached.In general, the BCPA, effective January 1, 2013, provided certain incentives to Apple in exchange for     specifically defined business     cooperation, and provided Qualcomm certain rights to Apple     s patents. The BCPA expired     on December 31, 2016, and is attached hereto as     Exhibit A....From 2013 through mid-2016, Apple received quarterly rebates     from Qualcomm, including the rebates required under the BCPA,     called BCP Payments.In other words, Apple didn't even wait a full month following   the BCPA's expiration to file suit.Ericsson and STMicroelectronics decided to dissolve the   ST-Ericsson joint venture, with Ericsson taking over baseband   modem products. It would exit soon.Broadcomagreed in September to acquire the 4G LTE assets from   Japan-based Renesas for $164 million.China's National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC)   began its anti-monopoly investigation in November.2014: Even more regulatory investigationsBroadcom announced in June that it wouldformally exitthe baseband market, and would attempt to sell its baseband   assets. The company expected to save $700 million in annual   operating expenses as a result. CEO Scott McGregor would later   say that Broadcom was losing $2 millionper dayby trying to compete in the baseband market. Of the initial 2,500   estimated layoffs, McGregor said 500 employees were able to find   other positions at Broadcom, but 2,000 workers were let go.No wonder companies kept exiting the baseband modem market.     Image source: Intel Investor Meeting 2014.Both the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and the European   Commission opened their own investigations, commencing in   September and October, respectively.Apple attempted yet again to negotiate a direct license,   knowing that several agreements would expire in less than two   years. It was unsuccessful.Discussions dating back to at least     November 2014 between Apple and Qualcomm about a     direct license for certain patents were conducted with     the knowledge that certain of the agreements governing the     parties' commercial relationship, such as the TA and BCPA,     were set to expire at the end of 2016.Roughly a year and a half after ST-Ericsson's dissolution,   Ericsson also bailed on basebands, cutting 1,000 jobs in the   process.2015: Qualcomm makes peace with China, attempts to with   AppleIn February, Qualcomm settled with China's NDRC and negotiated   a rectification plan. The company paid the $975 million fine in   full and agreed to modify its business practices in the Middle   Kingdom. Qualcomm began charging royalty rates of 5% for 3G CDMA   and WCDMA devices, including multimode devices that use both 3G   and 4G. 4G devices that do not use CDMA fetch 3.5%. In both   cases, that percentage is levied on a royalty base of 65% of the   device's net selling price. Qualcomm offered these terms to   Apple, but Apple rejected them, not believing that the offer was   consistent with FRAND.Four years after acquiring Icera's baseband assets, NVIDIA   announced in May that it would wind down its Icera baseband   operations, conceding defeat to Qualcomm.Marvellannounced a ""significant restructuring"" of its mobile platform,   alsobailing on mobile chipslike basebands and applications processors. Annualized operating   expense savings were estimated at $170 million to $220 million;   Marvell laid off 17% of its employees.The European Commission sent Qualcomm two formal   Statements of Objection in December based on its preliminary   conclusions that ""the company may have illegally paid a major   customer for exclusively using its chipsets and sold chipsets   below cost with the aim of forcing a competitor out of the   market."" Well, now we know who that major customer is, although   Apple wasn't named at the time.2016: The end of exclusivityApple approached Qualcomm once again in February looking for a   direct license. During discussions, Qualcomm disagreed on which   patents may or may not be in fact essential, and the company   removed a public list of its patents from its website.On February 5, 2016, Apple reiterated its interest in     exploring a direct license to certain patents in Qualcomm's     patent portfolio....Apple rejected Qualcomm's attempt to shirk its burden to     prove the merits of its claims. Qualcomm thereafter removed     from its website its public list of U.S. patents disclosed to     [European Telecommunications Standards Institute] and precluded     archive searching of that list. Consistent with Qualcomm's     other hide-the-ball behavior, this action makes it harder for a     licensee to determine which patents Qualcomm has declared to be     essential to cellular standards.Qualcomm's exclusivity as Apple's baseband supplier ended in   the spring.The KFTC requested information from Apple, and Apple testified   to the KFTC in August. Less than a month later, Qualcomm   retaliated by withholding the quarterly Q2 rebate payment   outlined by the BCPA that Apple had earned as of June 30 but   wasn't due to be paid until September. Qualcomm hasn't paid the   subsequent two quarterly payments, either. The $1 billion that   Apple is seeking comprises three quarterly payments.2017: Back to the futureThat more or less brings us up to speed with how Qualcomm   extracted exclusivity from Apple, which was a key factor in   pushing out rivals. Apple is by far the largest purchaser of   stand-alone modems, and missing out on that business was utterly   fatal for rivals' baseband ambitions. In Apple's words:This conduct has foreclosed Qualcomm's competitors from     dealing with Apple, a key purchaser of chipsets, leading to the     marginalization and exit of many of those competitors, and to     the acquisition and maintenance by Qualcomm of monopoly power.     But-for Qualcomm's conduct as alleged herein, rival chipset     manufacturers would have become stronger competitors to     Qualcomm.No other Apple supplier in history has been able to wield such   power over the Cupertino company. The key differentiator was   Qualcomm's massive patent portfolio, combined with its   willingness to disregard industry norms as well as its own FRAND   licensing commitments. Perhaps more importantly for Apple going   forward, there will probably never be another supplier with this   much power ever again.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

This Week in Solar;January 28, 2017, 08:15:00 AM EDT;"There's a lot to get to this week in solar, so let's dive   right in.The fast and furious progress of solar energyIn 2011, then Secretary of the U.S. Department of Energy   Steven Chu launched the SunShot initiative with a goal of cutting   the cost of installing a utility-scale solar system for $1 per   watt by 2020. At the time, I called the 74% reduction in the cost   of solar in a decade ""an audacious goal.""Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();Less than six years later and three years ahead of schedule,   I'm here to say that I underestimated the solar industry.   Projects are being built for less than $1 per watt today, and   cost reductions continue to amaze even the most bullish   observers. Everything from solar panels to inverters to   permitting costs have come down in the last six years with the   SunShot program helping with the reductions. And $1 per-watt   solar will lead to a whole new surge in demand, which is very   bullish for solar companies around the world.Apple and NV Energy find common groundBerkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK-A) (NYSE: BRK-B) subsidiary NV Energy has taken its   share of lumps from the renewable energy industry over the last   few years. Solar advocates helped drive a ballot measure in   November that will give customers more choice than buying energy   from the monopoly. And casino companies, which are its largest   customers, are starting tocut their ties to the utilityand buy energy elsewhere.NV Energy may be learning that it can't take such an   adversarial approach to renewable energy and customers' desires   to buy renewables after agreeing to help Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL)   build a 200 MW solar power plant by early 2019. The utility will   buy energy from the solar plant and sell the energy to Apple for   a data center in Reno, continuing Apple's growth in solar   adoption.Corporate customers will likely be big drivers of renewable   energy in 2017, demanding clean energy to power their businesses   around the country. Maybe utilities are finally learning that   it's better to go along with the renewable-energy revolution than   fight it and lose their customers to someone else.Don't freak out about the ITC... yetThe solar industry is abuzz with speculation about the solar   investment tax credit (ITC), which helps fund every solar project   in the country today. The subsidy was extended at the end of 2015   and is currently set to startstepping down from 30% in 2019to a permanent 10% from commercial projects, and 0% for   residential projects, starting in 2022.It's no secret that most of the new Trump Administration is   less in favor of renewable energy than the past administration,   so there's concern the ITC could be in trouble. But comments from   Treasury Secretary nominee Steve Mnuchin in support of wind   subsidies, and Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson in   relation to climate change, have eased some of those   tensions.Keep in mind that the ITC stepdown is current law and would   require an act of Congress, including 60 votes in the Senate, to   be repealed. I think that's unlikely to happen, especially when   you consider the 200,000+ jobs in solar and extreme popularity of   the energy source. The ITC seems safe, despite the likelihood   that it's unpopular inside the White House. Unless something   changes, solar investors can breathe a sigh of relief.News and notesHere are the other notable items of the week that investors   shouldn't lose sight of.Eos Energy Storage andSiemens(NASDAQOTH: SIEGY)announced a partnershipto integrate, install, and service utility-scale energy-storage   solutions. It's hard to state how big it is that a giant in   electricity-distribution equipment is taking a role in energy   storage, which will help solar provide more value to the grid. We   don't know exactly what will happen with the partnership in terms   of costs or demand for utility-scale storage, but the fact that   it's on the radar of giants of the industry is big for renewable   energy.Pattern Energy Group(NASDAQ: PEGI) announced the closing of $350 million in senior   notes due 2024 with a 5.875% interest rate. The financing will   help the company pay down short-term debt and acquire more   renewable-energy projects. If this is a sign that yieldco   financing is opening up, it would be good for the entire   industry.Canadian Solar(NASDAQ: CSIQ) signed a contract earlier this week with the   Sacramento Municipal Utility District to sell energy from a 60 MW   solar farm over the course of 20 years starting in mid-2017.   There haven't been a lot of big contract signings in the U.S.   over the past year, so any movement in the space is notable, even   if 60 MW is only about 1% of Canadian Solar's annual   manufacturing capacity.10 stocks we like better than Wal-MartWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock     tip, it can pay to listen.

Microsoft's Surface Lineup Is Now a $4.3 Billion Business;January 27, 2017, 04:10:00 PM EDT;"Surface lineup. Image source: Microsoft.WhenMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) first launched itsSurface lineup in 2012, I had my doubts as to whether or not the company could   successfully jump into hardware. The company has had its fair   share of missteps for the Surface, but it's safe to say at this   point that Microsoft has exceeded most early expectations for its   first-party devices. Microsoft has adapted quickly to flops like   Surface RT, which resulted in a $900 million writedown back in   2013, and pushed forward with expanding the portfolio, most   recently with Surface Studio.makeArticleAd();Surface revenue during the fourth quarter came in at $1.3   billion, representing a sequential increase of over 40% for the   busy holiday shopping season. That's enough to bring full-year   2016 Surface revenue to an impressive $4.3 billion.Data source: Microsoft. Chart by author. Calendar years     shown.It also probably helps that CEO Satya Nadella is a stronger   leader than his predecessor, even though the Surface strategy was   conceived under Steve Ballmer. The push with Surface hardware   created a rift between Ballmer and Bill Gates, and may have also   contributed to Ballmer's ouster.Out with the old, in with the newDuring the earnings call, Nadella noted that Surface has   enjoyed three consecutive quarters of 25%-plus growth. Sales mix   is transitioning toward the newer products like Surface Pro 4 and   Surface Book, and Surface 3 sales are expected to continue   winding down.The customer reception for Surface Studio in particular has   been strong, which is especially impressive for two reasons:   Surface Studio was not widely available during the fourth   quarter, and it's extremely expensive, starting at $3,000.   Inventories for the new all-in-one should start improving this   quarter as production ramps up.Taking a bite out of AppleMore broadly, Surface is but part of a bigger push among the   Windows PC crowd to take a bite out ofApple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) turf: the premium PC market. Surface is doing   well, but it was never expected to comprise a large chunk of the   Windows ecosystem; that's what original equipment manufacturers   (OEMs) are for.CFO Amy Hood said that Microsoft's ""OEM non-pro performance   should grow ahead of the market, due to strength in the premium   device category."" In other words, high-end consumer-oriented PCs   made by Microsoft's partners are gaining traction in the market,   at a time when Apple lost PC market share for thefirst three quartersof 2016 (Apple reports fourth-quarter results next week). OEM   non-pro revenue grew 5% last quarter, outpacing the broader PC   market.Surface is profitable, tooIt's also worth pointing out that Surface is now profitable on   a gross margin basis (up 6% last quarter in dollar terms), so   those revenue gains are starting to enjoy some operating   leverage.Unfortunately, currency headwinds are adversely impacting   profitability, as Surface gross margin was up 17% on a constant   currency basis in dollar terms. There's a big discrepancy between   the currency impacts on revenue (2 percentage points) compared to   gross margin (11 percentage points), which is due to the fact   that Surface devices are manufactured in Asia and the Surface   cost structure is more vulnerable to currency fluctuations.Still, you have to give Nadella credit for being able to take   a struggling segment conceived under Ballmer and turn it into a   profitable $4.3 billion business within just a couple of   years.10 stocks we like better than MicrosoftWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

10 Stocks to Buy That Already Make America Great;January 27, 2017, 03:07:22 PM EDT;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAmidst the bombast, braggadocio and fact-free claims of the 2016 presidential campaign, perhaps the most effective was the subtext contained in President Trump's incessantly cited mantra, ""Make America Great Again.""makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockThe implication of this successful sonnet of sloganism is that America is not great, at least not in its current iteration. And while certainly an effectual rhetorical rallying point for the most disaffected voters, the claim fails to hold up to scrutiny when one takes a more lucid view of the corporate and investing landscape.Indeed, there are scores of companies, and scores of stocks to own, that already make America great. These are the companies that make the products and services that Americans organize their lives around. Creators of communication devices, social media networks and information retrieval services are just a few of the brilliant achievements of entrepreneurial Americans that have made the country great through the genius of their ideas.7 Stocks to Buy That Could Double by 2018They're also among the top companies, and the top stocks, that make our nation great for investors. If you want to feel good about the country, and about the prospects for long-term portfolio performance, here are 10 stocks to own thatalreadymake America great.Stocks to Buy: Boeing (BA)Source:Phillip Capper via FlickrPremier American aircraft manufacturerBoeing Co(NYSE:BA) also is one of the largest defense contractors in the U.S. The company supplies Western military forces with the F-15 and F-18 fighter jets, which also are capable of precision strategic bombing runs crucial to defeating enemies such as the Islamic State.Just check out this footage of an F-18 delivering ISIS fighters a dead-on strike with a500-lb laser guided bomb[Graphic content warning] and you'll be convinced of the efficacy of its fighter jets in the effort against a determined, well-funded and ideologically inspired army.Yet Boeing is far more than just a builder of military hardware. The company's iconic ""7 Series"" passenger jets - the 747, 737, 777 and 787 - have allowed not just Americans, but travelers worldwide to speed off to their destinations safely, and in style. If you want evidence of American corporate greatness, just look to the sky near any major metropolitan airport. You're sure to spot the greatness of Boeing in flight.Stocks to Buy:Amazon.com (AMZN)Source: ShutterstockOnline seller of everythingAmazon.com(NASDAQ:AMZN) has been making America great for nearly 23 years. The brainchild of CEO Jeff Bezos began life as a hub where avid readers could get the latest novels, and discover both new and old works that would appeal to their tastes.That formula worked not only for literature, but for everything from music, film, video games, electronics, clothing, toys, toothpaste  and just about anything else one can require or desire.Amazon.com's relatively recent foray into the cloud computing business has been an unequivocal success, with the company raking in some $3.2 billion in cloud computing revenue in the third quarter of 2016.3 Fast-Food Stocks That Are Sweating Bullets Thanks to McDonald'sThat figure was up 55% from the same quarter the year prior. Amazon's web services business proves that not only does the company make America great by delivering the products we want right to our door, it also makes possible many of the e-commerce sites the American - and global - economy relies on to function smoothly.Stocks to Buy:Apple (AAPL)Source:Yuanbin Du Via FlickrPersonal technology giantApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) is not only one of the most profitable companies in history, it's alsothe most admired. And why shouldn't it be?The ubiquity, efficacy, ease of operation, quality, sophisticated industrial design and just outright aesthetic beauty of the company's products is a feat of entrepreneurial genius that on its own can be cited as a ""drop-the-mic"" reason why America already deserves the greatness title.The company's iconic products - the Mac, iPod, iPad and iPhone - all have transformed the way not only Americans live, but also the way most of the developed and developing nations live. AAPL stock ran into a slowdown for much of 2016, but since Election Day, Wall Street has made Apple shares great again, with a surge of more than 10%.Investors are clearly betting on the continued upside likely to come with the release of the company's 10th-anniversary iPhone. If you want proof America is already great, just check your iMessages.Stocks to Buy:Facebook (FB)Source: ShutterstockSocial media pioneerFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) is a relatively recent entry into the ranks of companies making America great, and it's done so by the sheer disruptive power of its product.The creation of CEO Mark Zuckerberg is the kind of game-changing invention that comes along infrequently, but when it does it's hard to see how we ever got along without it.From connecting with old friends to staying in contact with relatives; and from discovering new interests, nurturing hobbies and networking with others who share similar worldviews, Facebook has become an essential part of the American (and global) experience.Ironically, Facebook's flap with ""fake news"" and its ranking of certain news stories was an issue in the presidential campaign. Yet Facebook also was cited by President Trump as a key to his victory, as he told CBS'60 Minutesthat thepower of his following on the social media gianthelped him win key races where he was outspent by his opponent.The 3 Best Sector ETFs to Buy for a Profitable 2017So, Facebook not only already makes America great, it also made President Trump's campaign a winner.Stocks to Buy:Goldman Sachs (GS)Source:Erik DrostIf you were asked to compile a list of the ""Big Banks"" that have financed America's growth, as well as her ascension to greatness, it's hard not to start withGoldman Sachs Group Inc(NYSE:GS).The premier investment bank has been at the center of the financial world since the reparative, post-Civil War years, when it helped finance America's rebirth beginning in 1869.Since then the company has had a storied history of providing the capital, as well as the financial framework, that's nurtured the rise of the greatest capitalist experiment in history.In another example ofTrumpianirony, the president criticized the banks - and specifically Goldman Sachs - for transgressions that caused the near-collapse of the financial system in 2008. Yet who did Trump turn to for key positions in his campaign and in his cabinet? You guessed it,numerous Goldman Sachs alumni.The moral of the story here is that when you want your own administration to be great, you turn to those who have done great things at one of the greatest American financial institutions.Stocks to Buy:Alphabet (GOOGL)Source: ShutterstockPerhaps the only thing not great aboutAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), better known as Google, is its ghastly choice of new moniker. Yet despite its ill-fitting name, Alphabet's core product - the Google search engine - has already made information-seeking America great.Founded by then-Ph.D. students Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were at Stanford University, the tech entrepreneurs leveraged the PC and internet explosion and created the go-to source for information on just about anything imaginable.Its corporate mission, to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful, has long been accomplished. And though Google has only been in existence for less than 20 years, like Facebook, it also has become an essential part of the American and the international experience.10 High-Yield Dividend Stocks That Are SOMEHOW Still BargainsJust try to go more than a few days without using Google. It's nearly impossible, especially if you are someone who loves knowing things.Stocks to Buy:Disney (DIS)Source: ShutterstockAnyone who has grown up in America since the 1940s, or who has reared children or grandchildren over the past five decades, knows all-too-well the draw that is theWalt Disney Co(NYSE:DIS).Purveyors of iconic American characters such as Mickey and Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck, Goofy, Snow White and so many others, the company has built a media and entertainment empire by knowing what Americans (and the world) want to see.Disney's relatively recent acquisition of the Star Wars franchise is proof of the company's commitment to remaining the leader in providing entertainment with the broadest appeal.Founded on the genius of Walt Disney the man, the Disney Company was set up to be a dream factory capable of igniting children's imaginations all over the world. It's safe to say that it has done just that, and that it will remain great long after President Trump has completed his tenure in the Oval Office.Stocks to Buy:American Express (AXP)Source:Marcus Quigmire Via FlickrWhen ""American"" is part of your name, it's easy to make the short hop of logic needed to proclaimAmerican Express Company(NYSE:AXP) a company that's already making America great. Indeed, the credit card issuer, andDow Jonescomponent, offers what is arguably the best customer service in the financial services industry.Moreover, it's an aspirational brand that pulls at the capitalist heart strings of nearly every American set on achieving financial prowess. For those who've experienced it, how can you forget being approved for your first American Express card? That grant signifies an arrival of sorts into an honored clubhouse of the financially fit.Here, too, irony and the Trump administration once again collide. If President Trump and the Republican Congress can get personal tax reform passed, American Express shares may be the biggest beneficiary. The reason why is because higher income and higher net worth consumers tend to use American Express more than rival credit cards.3 Dividend Aristocrats to Buy for Income and GrowthAs such, a reduction in marginal tax rates for the nation's top earners would likely translate into increased spending via AmEx - which would funnel down directly to AXP shares.Stocks to Buy:Caterpillar (CAT)Source:Anthony via FlickrThe makers of earth-shaping equipment have literally transformed the American landscape into man's image, a feat that on its own qualifiesCaterpillar Inc.(NYSE:CAT) for a spot on the 10 stocks that already make America great.The unmistakable CAT brand is responsible for helping more builders erect more homes, shopping centers, office buildings, roads, bridges and dams than any government infrastructure project could ever do.In fact, any effort to make America's infrastructure great again would likely start with a whole lot of equipment from Caterpillar, as its heavy machinery is an integral part of massive build outs here at home, and worldwide.The CAT brand also is seen as a sort of badge of honor in the developing world, as developing nations seek to build their infrastructure in the image of the American landscape. To the rest of the world, America is already great  and they often use Caterpillar equipment to help their own nations look like us.Stocks to Buy:Tesla Motors (TSLA)Source: ShutterstockAmerica is a car culture country, and many of her most iconic brands -General Motors Company(NYSE:GM) andFord Motor Company(NYSE:F) - represent the best of American industrial prowess.While these storied brands could themselves be on any list of stocks that already make America great, one new car company embodies all of the entrepreneurial and innovative genius that's at the heart of what makes America special. That company isTesla Motors Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA).The brainchild of the ceaselessly creative Elon Musk, Tesla has proven that luxury, performance and the lack of an internal combustion engine can be a splendid marriage; one never lacking in operator excitement. In fact, the experience of driving the posh, powerful and eminently smooth Model S through traffic is akin to what it must be like piloting a modern fighter jet through a formation of P-51 Mustangs.5 Blue-Chip Stocks to Sell in FebruaryAnd while the World War II fighter helped make America great by vanquishing her enemies in aerial combat, Tesla's Model S, Model X and Model 3 are clearing a new path for automotive technology - technology that could be the American and global standard in decades to come.As of this writing, Jim Woods was long AMZN, FB, GS and TSLA stock.The post10 Stocks to Buy That Already Make America Greatappeared first onInvestorPlace."
The Cloud Drives Technology Stocks This Quarter;January 27, 2017, 02:59:00 PM EDT;"Analysts and experts have talked at length about the importance of cloud computing and how it would transform the technology sector. But the sense of waiting that underpinned such discussions is now giving way to a sense of arrival.Several factors are making cloud computing a reality today, the most important of which are an awareness of the resultant cost reductions, awareness of the economic value of processing ever-increasing volumes of data, and recognition of the advantages of sharing resources and having anytime anywhere access to data and information.Of course, along with all these advantages comes concerns related to privacy and security, which have been further exacerbated by government snooping, gag orders and orders to turn over data in private individual devices or in servers on foreign soil that have in turn made individuals and corporations wary about adopting the cloud.But technology companies are fighting it out. MicrosoftMSFTfor one has strongly resisted government demands as have AppleAAPLand AmazonAMZN. Alphabet'sGOOGLGoogle has also been vocal in its opposition. It makes perfect sense when you consider that these are some of the biggest cloud computing stocks that also offer computing and other devices. So they have vested interests at both ends of the networks.Other players with similar interests are chip makers like IntelINTC, NVIDIANVDA, Qualcomm and Advanced Micro DevicesAMD; networking companies like Cisco and Juniper; and software/service companies like IBM and Oracle.Here's a brief glimpse of three cloud companies that just reported December quarter results:IntelIntel's results this quarter were driven by both the PC and data center businesses. The PC strength was seasonal and unlikely to be sustained.Although non-volatile memory had the strongest growth rate of 24.8% and will grow even stronger this year, it currently contributes a lower share of revenue, which equates to fewer incremental dollars. Also, the business is poised to benefit from Intel's strength in the server market.Data center revenue growth of 8% year over year was helped by platform volume growth of 3% and platform price increase of 4%. Intel has new products in the pipeline and will also be integrating some technology it acquired through Altera, so this year may be less disappointing than the last when enterprise softness skewed expectations.MicrosoftMicrosoft has become a cloud-focused company, impressing analysts and investors alike. The company is making the most of legacy workloads that use its software and its all-new Windows OS, while leveraging Office productivity software and enterprise relationships to post record growth in cloud revenue.The company reported solid cloud results, with Azure revenue growing 93% (95% in constant currency) and compute usage doubling year over year. Its cloud productivity business also saw strong growth: Office 365 commercial revenue grew 47% (49% in constant currency) with seat growth of 37% and monthly active iOS and Android devices more than doubling to 65 million, Office 365 consumer revenue grew 22% (21% in constant currency) with seat growth of 20.9%.Dynamics 365 paid seats also more than doubled. Nadella promised commercial cloud annualized revenue runrate of $20.0 billion in 2018 and last quarter's $14.0 billion means that Microsoft is definitely on track to beat or exceed the target.AlphabetAlphabet doesn't break out its cloud revenue separately although independent market research data indicates that it is well behind market leader Amazon and even runners up Microsoft. In fact after the December quarter results some analysts have started saying that Microsoft has also started pulling away from the pack in its chase of Amazon.Alphabet's growth should not be discounted however because while cloud and hardware are lumped together right now, its common knowledge that most of its new hardware has been unavailable for a lot of the time. So the 62% growth in this segment seems to be less on account of hardware sales and more of an indication of strength it is seeing in the cloud.CFO Ruth Porat has said that cloud, hardware and YouTube subscriptions will be ""major revenue drivers for Google in the next several years."" This will of course require capital investment, something the company can afford given the way the search business continues to rake in cash. Capex was around $3.08 billion last quarter, that's nearly up by a billion dollars and will mostly be spent on data centers to support its cloud business.Now See Our Private Investment IdeasWhile the above ideas are being shared with the public, other trades are hidden from everyone but selected members.

Fitbit Inc (FIT) Stock Has Quite a Wall to Climb;January 27, 2017, 11:48:32 AM EDT;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhenever high-flying stocks get their wings clipped, they are never the same on the markets.Fitbit Inc(NYSE:FIT) ended its recovery of the summer of 2016 when it warned on Nov. 2, 2016, that fourth-quarter estimates would miss estimates. Bears are all over the stock: short float stands at 43.5%. And when the company reports results in February, bulls still hope the company's wearables devices sold like hot cakes.makeArticleAd();Source:Via FitbitExpectations Lowered for FIT StockIn its third-quarter report, the company cut the current quarter's estimatessharply:""The company expects revenue between $725 million and $750 million, representing growth of 2%-5%, with non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the range of $0.14 to $0.18, and a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 33%.""At a full-year earnings per share of between 55 cents and 59 cents, FIT trades at a forward P/E of up to 13.5 times (Based on Thursday's closing price of $7.41). Investors clearly have low expectations for the company. Trailing quarterly sales grew by 23.1%. Shorts are winning the bearish bet because they understand a company with good products is not necessarily a good stock.Competition Heating UpDespite a record low valuation, low expectations for the quarter and potential growth in Europe and Asia, FIT stock has one big problem: competition. During the holiday season, consumers had the choice of buying many cheaper alternatives at a fraction of a FIT device. In Asia,Xiaomisells similar wearables for a fraction of FIT's price.On the high end, FIT competes with theGarmin Ltd.(NASDAQ:GRMN) Vivosmart HR, which costs the same as Fitbit's Charge 2 (both cost around $149.95) andApple Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AAPL) Apple Watch 1 and 2.If FIT's stock collapses post-earnings, it will be among a long list of fallen fad stocks. This includesGoPro Inc(NASDAQ:GPRO), whose action camera is losing popularity andEtsy Inc(NASDAQ:ETSY), whose handmade products compete withAmazon.com, Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AMZN) homemadestore.Fitbit's next phase of growth depends on expanding internationally. Executing on this requires good management. When management said it mishandled the Flex 2 supply chain, few investors should have any confidence on management.On Jan. 12, news broke out that Fitbit may havewantedto acquireJawbonelate last year. This is another example that suggests investors should worry about FIT's management capability.Whole Foods Market, Inc. (WFM) in the Fresh Food WarsThe company needs to preserve its cash, instead of spending it on supply chain managementBottom Line on FitbitFitbit knows that competition will worsen over time. Its (rumored) attempts to buy Jawbone would have eliminated that threat, positioning the company as a stronger foe against Apple, Garmin and the cheap wearable device makers.The stock is still a ""show me"" investment though, especially if holiday sales are underwhelming.As of this writing, Chris Lau had no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

The designer created a sleek looking concept for the iPhone 8 that has a curved display. It's a slim device that has a sleek look to it. One interesting idea that can be seen in the concept is the change for the camera. The concept puts the camera for the iPhone 8 inside of the AAPL logo. It's an interesting idea, but not likely one the tech company will adopt.iPad Anniversary:Today is the 7-year anniversary for the iPad,MacRumorsnotes. Apple founder Steve Jobs introduced the iPad to audiences at a media event in 2010. He called it AAPL's ""most advanced technology in a magical and revolutionary device at an unbelievable price."" The original iPad had a 9.7-inch display with a resolution of 1024 x 768. It came in 16GB, 32GB and 64GB models. The tablet was powered by the tech company's A4 processor.Apple Watch Music:Owners of the Apple Watch have the ability to take music with them on the go without their iPhone, reports9to5Mac. The smartwatch has the ability to store up to 2GB of music. It all has to be in a single playlist first. It also requires an iPhone to get the music on there in the first place. The smartwatch can also be paired with wireless headphones so users can listen to the music through them.

Samsung (SSNLF) Expected to Launch Galaxy S8 on March 29;January 27, 2017, 11:30:57 AM EDT;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWith the official Galaxy Note 7 battery review out of the way, everyone has been waiting forSamsung Electronics Co Ltd(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) to release the new Galaxy S8. Samsung still isn't saying anything, but clues have been building that it will be later than normal. NowVentureBeatsays it has the first photos of the elusive smartphone as well as an exact Galaxy S8 launch date.makeArticleAd();Source: SamsungSamsung's well-publicized disaster with the Galaxy Note 7 had a big ripple effect on the Galaxy S8.First, the company had to identify - without question - what had caused Galaxy Note 7 batteries to burst into flames. Then it had to pinpoint a fail-safe solution to the problem. After that, it had to hold an event where it publicly reviewed its findings and outlined the steps it had taken to ensure it never happens again. Thatevent took place last week.Galaxy S8 Launch Pushed Back by Battery ConcernsAs part of the battery investigation, Samsung also had to take measures to ensure the Galaxy S8 would not have similar problems, and that would have involved delayed finalization of the battery and related components. And you can bet the company has taken testing of the battery on its new flagship smartphone to new levels.As a result, it seemed likely the Galaxy S8 launch date would be pushed from it's traditional Mobile World Congress unveiling in February. Samsung confirmed this during last week's event.7 Stocks to Buy That Could Double by 2018The Guardian, citing anonymous sources close to Samsung, pointed to alate March release date. Yesterday,VentureBeat'sEvan Blassclaimed to have specifics, saying the Galaxy S8 launch will take place at a Samsung Unpacked event in New York City on March 29.Galaxy S8 DetailsTheVentureBeatreport also includes many technical details about SSNLF's new flagship handset(s), including photos.As has been speculated, it appears that this year both Galaxy S8 smartphones will feature a curved ""Edge"" Super AMOLED display, but both will also lose the Home button so nearly the entire front is display - the camera remains at top. As a result, even though the overall dimensions stay roughly the same, both new smartphones will have larger displays than the Galaxy Note 7: 5.8-inches and 6.2-inches.The fingerprint sensor has been moved to the back, and high tech biometrics are supplemented by an iris scanner. The charge port is the new USB-C standard, base storage moves to 64GB (with SD card expansion still offered) and unlikeApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL), Samsung will reportedly keep the headphone jack.By connecting to an optional dock, the Galaxy S8 will be able to be used as an Android computer. And it will feature Bixby, theadvanced AI personal assistantSamsung gained when it purchased Viv in October.Apple Inc. New iPads Might Be Late to the Party (AAPL)Interestingly,VentureBeatsays the price of both models - which it says will go on sale April 21 - will be 100 (roughly $100) more than last year's models.The Importance of the Galaxy S8 LaunchIt can't be understated how critical this release is to SSNLF. After recalling 3 million Galaxy Note 7s', its reputation took a serious blow. Apple will be pulling out all the stops with the iPhone 8 later this year, as it celebrates the iPhone's 10th anniversary and mounts a major campaign to convince upgraders.Alphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) released its first Google-branded smartphone in the Pixel Phone at the height of the Galaxy Note 7 debacle, and a follow-up is expected this year.Both rivals will be gunning to boost sales at Samsung's expense.In the last quarterly sales report (from the end of October), Samsung's smartphone sales marketshare haddropped 13.5%compared to the previous year. The next quarter's numbers could be even worse. If the Galaxy S8 launch flops, Samsung's time at the top of the smartphone sales charts would likely be over.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace3 Things Apple Inc.

Can Apple Inc. (AAPL) Afford a War With Qualcomm, Inc. (QCOM)?;January 27, 2017, 11:26:42 AM EDT;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsPatent wars are harmful to corporations and other growing things.makeArticleAd();Source:iphonedigital via FlickrApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) has now gone to patent war withQualcomm, Inc.(NASDAQ:QCOM), knocking 13% off the modem chip maker's market cap in less than a week.The warhas now extended to China, where two Apple suits are seeking $145 million in damages (about 1 billion Yuan) over how Qualcomm licenses patents there.This being early in the war, the response of Qualcomm CEO Steve Mollenkopf is""bring it on.""But, he hasn't seen the legal bills, yet. Shareholders, however, seem to have a clue about what they might be, and apparently feel they will be huge.Apple has yet to be hurt by any of this. AAPL stock price is up about 1.7% since the court papers were filed. But, the march to its record high of $132.54 per share, achieved in May 2015, may now be disrupted.3 Grossly Overpriced Tech Stocks That Could CollapseWhat the War Is AboutQualcomm controls standards essential patents (SEPs), including those for the Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) system used by carriers such asVerizon Communications Inc.(NYSE:VZ). This means that every CDMA phone chip maker, and CDMA base station maker, is paying license fees to Qualcomm for using those patents. Apple began doing so in 2011when it opened the iPhone to Verizon's network.Qualcomm used its CDMA patents to become the sole supplier of modem chips for the iPhone. It liked this position and refused to join industry-wide agreements covering Fair, Reasonable and Non-Discriminatory (FRAND) access to its patents, giving QCOM the power to constrict Apple's supply of modem chips.Apple eventually foundanother supplier for the chips,Intel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC), while still paying license fees to Qualcomm.Qualcomm, meanwhile,won an expensive fight with China over its patent rights, and is fighting with South Korea after gettingSamsung Electronics(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) to back down and use Qualcomm gear in its phones.The short version is that Qualcomm uses its patents to control the global phone market and Apple doesn't like that.The Risk to AppleWhile the market has discounted the risks in these fights to Qualcomm, it has not considered the potential impact on Apple. Credit the $642 billion market cap of Apple, against Qualcomm's $76 billion.There is also a whisper number on Apple earnings, due out January 31, of$77.04 billion in revenue and profit of $3.23 per share. Combine that with over $200 billion in cash and the market may be anticipating a raise in the Apple dividend, currently 57 cents per share. AAPL stock price is still floating on Christmas.But, the risks in a patent war are real. Intel had to turn itself inside-out to make those iPhone modem chips. Another generation of phones and networks is coming, and Qualcomm will have patents to fight with there, too.Apple has already suffered, the company claimed in court, losing a $1 billion rebate it says Qualcomm owed it after AAPL helpeda South Korean investigationinto Qualcomm's business practices, one that resulted in South Korea imposing$864 million in fines.So far, Qualcomm has won in China and it has won against Samsung, and Apple's legal arguments don't scare it. If Korea can get Qualcomm to pay the fine, Samsung may feel emboldened, but SSNLF isin disarrayand may not be in a position to fight Qualcomm any time soon. Apple has taken up its sword.Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Steals AI Expert Back From Apple Inc. (AAPL)Given Apple's market size, the cost of lawyers to fight Qualcomm business practices may appear to be a rounding error, but this is going to be a nasty and costly fight. Apple's autonomy in its supply decisions is at stake, as is Qualcomm's control over the market.The market has yet to discount Apple stock over the costs of this war, but I suspect that will happen soon.

Asia Will Take Over the World, and Facebook Inc (FB) Wants In;January 27, 2017, 10:10:22 AM EDT;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIt's an awkward topic for rogue, extreme-right wing elements in our country. Heck,I'mnot even sure how I really feel about it. But there's a point where it's no longer useful to continuously ignore the giant pink elephant in the room. So here goes it - Asia will take over the world. There's not a darn thing anyone can do to stop the train. AndFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) will have it no other way.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockIn fact, Facebook is probably one of the few companies that recognize this demographic reality. Subsequently, FB stock is a very real challenger to the near-hegemonic dominance ofAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL).Honestly, the social media network is well on its way to becoming whatApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) once was before copycat competitors entered the fray: a completely unique experience and solution with no natural predators.Interestingly, much of society is turning their back towards the demographic goldmine that Facebook stock is sitting on. The NFL celebrates ""Hispanic Heritage Month,"" and Mexico Cityhosteda regular-season game last year. After activists blasted the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences with the hashtag #OscarsSoWhite, the film industry made dramatic changes. According to NBC News, the ""'African-American Film Critics Association declared 2016 the best year forblacks in cinema'ever'.""While these are profound steps towards diversity and inclusion, there's a glaring omission. According to researchers at theUniversity of Southern California, ""'at least half or more of all cinematic, television, or streaming stories"" didn't portray a single Asian or Asian-American on screen.'""This ""yellow-out"" may be swept under the rug now, but mark my words, FB stock will change everything.Asian Markets Too Bigly for FB Stock to IgnoreAs InvestorPlace contributor Craig Adeyanju notes, the Facebook stock price is all about the numbers, and the numbers look amazing! Adeyanju writes that with ""Facebook on course to reach 2 billion users this year without China, the opportunities become bigger once China allows FB in its country again. Keep in mind that China currently has thelargest numberof internet users globally.""7 Stocks to Buy That Could Double by 2018He is so right - the number of China'sinternet usersexceed that of the U.S. by a more than 150% margin. Those are bigly consumers that FB stock desperately wants to tap into. But they're notthatdesperate. China is often overused as a justification for buying Facebook stock or any number of investments. However, just scale up the picture a bit and you'll see why Mark Zuckerberg is so excited.Themajorityof Earth's human population is Asian, period. Even if you were to open a ""heritage month"" for every race, color and creed in America, you would at most affect less than 5% of the world. Adding in the entire Latin American population would help, but the leverage would be less than Africa, and slightly more than Europe.An investment in Facebook stock is simply a recognition of a changing world. Unfortunately, few have this ability. For example,Princeton Universitydetailed evidence ofdiscrimination in academiadesigned to ""cull"" Asian student populations. In contrast, from the perspective of FB stock, these demographic trends are to be embraced, celebrated and ultimately, profited.Untapped Riches Still Available for Facebook StockI mentioned before that China is an overused argument. But when you drill deeper into the statistics, there's still a lot of gold for FB stock to mine. The perennial Asian powerhouse's internet penetration is just slightly above half the population. In contrast, the U.S. internet penetration is nearly 89%. That's the raw, low-hanging fruit from which Facebook stock can benefit.3 Reasons Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Will Keep Delivering in 2017But even in a place like Japan, where the internet penetration is more than 91%, there's still a viable opportunity for FB. As of the midway point of last year, there were26 million JapaneseFacebook subscribers. That's less than a 21% penetration rate for the company. Japan is actually an unheralded market: it has an incredibly educated, tech savvy population.In many ways, that's a better prospect for FB stock rather than activating developing or frontier markets because of the existing infrastructure.Click to EnlargeBut the really exciting potential is that when developing countries reach the next stage, FB can spark a global revolution. Asia's total Facebook penetration rate is less than 14% - just marginally better than Africa. That means that the company's future is in Asian hands.The North American market is near realistic capacity at 62%, while Latin America is not that far behind at 52%. Given the enormous economic growth in Asia, that's not a bad gig for FB stock.While the rest of the world is focused on the transition of power at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, Facebook has been looking at a trend decades in the making. Indeed, the movement is inevitable and will have far-reaching consequences well outside our lifetimes. They only thing any company can do is to prepare for it, and FB has a substantial lead.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 High-Yield Dividend Stocks That Are SOMEHOW Still Bargains10 Stocks to Buy to Survive a ""Trumpsy-Turvy"" 2017The postAsia Will Take Over the World, and Facebook Inc (FB) Wants Inappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Videogame Stock Roundup: Microsoft Reports Q2 Earnings, Nintendo Launches Pokemon Go in South Korea;January 27, 2017, 09:16:00 AM EDT;"Among the top stories this week, Microsoft Corp.MSFTreported second-quarter fiscal 2017 results. In a separate development, after almost a six-month delay, South Korean gamers can now enjoy Pokmon Go as NintendoNTDOYlaunched the game officially in the country.Meanwhile, Facebook IncFBzeroed in on Hugo Barra, an ex-Xiaomi executive to spearhead its VR initiatives.Recap of the Developments1. Microsoft's second-quarter fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings of 83 cents and revenues $26.07 billion easily beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Though gaming is a very small part of the company's business, Xbox is an important aspect of the overall video game industry. Microsoft's gaming revenues fell 3% (1% in constant currency). Xbox Live monthly active users were up 17% to 55 million. The company witnessed more than 26 billion hours of gameplay on Windows 10 PCs and tablets.The company's shares have surged 26% compared with the ZacksComputer-Softwareindustry's gain of 24.31% in the last one year.At present, Microsoft carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy)   stocks here.2. After a six-month delay, Nintendo has now officiallylaunchedits blockbuster hit game, Pokmon Go in South Korea, on both Alphabet'sGOOGLPlay Store and Apple Inc.'sAAPLiOS store. Per media reports, Nintendo's Pokmon Go works with Google Maps, which has ""limited access"" in South Korea. Niantic had earlier sought permission from the South Korean government for access to Korean maps, which was flatly refused. Google had not agreed to South Korean government's demand to ""blur"" sensitive locations like government buildings on Maps.Reportedly, the denial stemmed from the fact that South Korea remains concerned about its national security. It doesn't share warm ties with its neighbor, North Korea. The simmering border tension between the two nations has led the South Korean government to disallow storage of detailed maps of the country on any other servers except those in South Korea, add media reports.It remains unknown how Niantic, the firm which developed Pokmon Go, bypassed the Maps issue, add media reports. Niantic chose to remain silent on this issue during the press conference it held in Seoul on Jan 23, 2017.Nintendo carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The success of Pokmon Go helped the company's share price. Over the past one year, its shares are up 55.86% compared with ZacksToys/Games/ Hobby/Productsindustry's gain of 18.42%.3. Meanwhile, Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg in a post announced that ex-Xiaomi vice president, Hugo Barra will spearhead all the company's VR initiatives as well as the Oculus unit. Zuckerberg further added ""Hugo shares my belief that virtual and augmented reality will be the next major computing platform. They'll enable us to experience completely new things and be more creative than ever before. Hugo is going to help build that future, and I'm looking forward to having him on our team.""Facebook had acquired Oculus for $2 billion in 2014. With Oculus, the company is trying to fuel its ambitious AR/VR efforts. Zuckerberg has time and again mentioned that VR is the next big business opportunity. Facebook has been pumping ample resources to boost its VR efforts. A few days back, Zuckerberg said that Facebook was going to spend over $3 billion over the next 10 years.However, Oculus has beenslappedwith a $2 billion lawsuit filed by video game company, ZeniMax. Zuckerberg appeared in a Dallas courtroom to testify against the allegations. Apparently, Zuckerberg has denied all allegations and stressed that ""The idea that Oculus technology is based on someone else's is just wrong.""At present, Facebook has a Zacks Rank #2.  In the past one year, Facebook's shares have generated a return of 39.92%, compared with the ZacksInternet Servicesindustry's gain of 19.39%.PerformanceThe following table shows the price movement of the major video game companies over both the past five trading days as well as the last six months:CompanyLast 5 DaysLast 6 MonthsATVI1.34%-5.03%EA1.68%6.32%GLUU6.98%-3.77%MSFT2.50%13.23%NTES6.00%23.20%TTWO4.15%33.77%ZNGA-2.65%-10.76%Over the last five trading sessions, Glu Mobile IncGLUUwas up 6.98% whereas Zynga IncZNGAwas down 2.65%.Over the last six-month period, Take Two InteractiveTTWOsurged the most (33.77%).

How Intel Corporation Can Strengthen Its Relationship With Apple Inc.;January 27, 2017, 08:21:00 AM EDT;"With theApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) iPhone 7, microprocessor giantIntel(NASDAQ: INTC) scored a lucky break, winning a significant   portion of the cellular modem orders for Apple's latest handsets   -- arguably the highest-profile smartphone win that Intel has   ever enjoyed.Image source: Apple.makeArticleAd();Intel cellular modem chips, branded the XMM 7360, are found   inside versions of the iPhone 7 devices used on networks that   don't implement the CDMA cellular standard. Chips from rivalQualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM) are found in the iPhone models used on CDMA   networks, as Intel's chips currently don't implement CDMA.Back in late 2015, Intel purchased the CDMA chipset assets   from a company called VIA Telecom,  presumably in a bid to   allow the former to build chips that could address the entirety   of Apple's cellular modem needs.Though Qualcomm is widely believed to build superior modems to   what Intel produces, Apple recently filed a lawsuit against   Qualcomm alleging, among other things, that ""Qualcomm has charged   Apple a monopolistic premium for access to CDMA chipsets that are   in all other aspects identical to chipsets sold to Apple without   CDMA functionality enabled. ... Qualcomm has used its monopoly   power in CDMA chipsets to obtain anticompetitive license and   chipset supply terms,"" the complaint filed on Jan. 20 read.I'll be writing more on the lawsuit in the coming days and   today there is an observation I would like to share regarding   Apple, Intel, Qualcomm, and CDMA iPhones.Apple's component costs could come down if Intel     succeeds in implementing CDMABased on this complaint, we now know that Qualcomm charges   Apple more for the same exact cellular modems with CDMA enabled   compared to versions without CDMA enabled. This isn't an unusual   practice in the semiconductor industry; companies like Intel   routinely charge more for identical chips but with certain   features enabled, compared with variants without those features   enabled. This is plain old product segmentation at work.Image source: Qualcomm.What's interesting is that Apple is complaining that, because   Qualcomm essentially has no viable competition for its   CDMA-enabled modems, it is charging a ""monopolistic premium.""The magnitude of this premium isn't clear, but it's clear that   Apple isn't happy about having to pay it, and therein lies the   opportunity for Intel.If Intel can develop a commercially viable LTE modem that also   supports CDMA (and is certified on all of the major CDMA   networks) using those VIA Telecom assets, then this would open   the door to a couple of possibilities:Intel could win more than just the non-CDMA iPhones. It     could be a true ""second source"" for all the iPhones that Apple     ships. This could potentially boost Intel's share at Apple, to     Intel's benefit (and to Qualcomm's detriment).Apple could be able to get cheaper CDMA modems from     Qualcomm. Even if Apple doesn't increase the proportion of     total modems that it purchases from Intel, the fact that Intel     and Qualcomm parts would be viable for all iPhone models could     help reduce the average price that Apple pays per cellular     modem.Net-net, Intel's becoming a stronger cellular modem provider   would mean that Apple should, in general, pay less for modems.   This could help modestly improve Apple's gross profit margin and,   ultimately, net profit.To put this into perspective, in the complaint, Apple says   that LTE modems sell for between $10 and $20. Let's suppose that   Apple must pay $15 for the non-CDMA Qualcomm chips and then $20   for the CDMA-capable Qualcomm chips -- though with the iPhone 7,   Apple doesn't appear to be buying any non-CDMA Qualcomm chips;   the non-CDMA iPhones now use Intel.If Apple can get that $20 figure down to $15 in the presence   of a viable alternative from Intel, then that's $5 saved across   potentially 100 million or more iPhone models sold in a year.   That $5 figure is for illustrative purposes only, as I have no   clue what the actual delta is, but multiplied across the volumes   that Apple sells, the savings Apple could potentially realize are   significant.Intel needs to executeThe key to all of this is for Intel to execute to building   increasingly competitive cellular modems. If Intel can, then   that's obviously a positive for Intel, as an opportunity to sell   more modems, and an opportunity for Apple, in the form of cheaper   modems.The loser, if Intel can supply more of Apple's volume --   whether or not it actually does -- would be Qualcomm, as at the   very least it could see the premium that it enjoys from the sale   of CDMA-capable LTE modems evaporate.In the scheme of things, though, losing a bit more Apple chip   business probably isn't going to sting Qualcommthatmuch. After all, Intel grabbed a bunch of iPhone share this   cycle, yet Qualcomm's chip business appears to be on theright track.10 stocks we like better than Wal-MartWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock   tip, it can pay to listen.

Should You Sell Qualcomm After Apple's $1 Billion Lawsuit?;January 26, 2017, 08:52:00 PM EDT;"Shares ofQualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM) plunged 13% on Jan. 23 after the chipmaker was   sued for $1 billion by one of its biggest customers,Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) . The lawsuit is related to the FTC's   separatelawsuit against Qualcomm, which alleges that the chipmaker leveraged its portfolio of   critical wireless patents to force its baseband competitors out   of the market. Let's take a closer look at this tangled   mess, and see if Qualcomm shareholders should sell their   shares.Image source: Apple.makeArticleAd();Why is Apple suing Qualcomm?Back in 2008,Sprintdeployed its first WiMax network, a 4G standard which wasn't   heavily dependent on Qualcomm's patent portfolio.Intel(NASDAQ: INTC) championed the use of WiMax chips, but   Qualcomm opposed WiMax in favor of its upcoming LTE standard --   which it could generate more licensing fees from.At the time, Apple considered launching an iPhone for WiMax   networks. Realizing that the move could hurt its LTE ambitions,   Qualcomm agreed to pay Apple ""rebates"" for sticking with its   baseband modems and waiting for its LTE standard instead. Those   rebate payments were dependent on Apple doing two things --exclusivelyusing Qualcomm's chips (from 2011 to 2016), and notinstigatingany litigation which accused the chipmaker of unfair   licensing practices. The FTC claims that Qualcomm essentially   ""bribed"" Apple with those rebates to prevent it from switching to   competing chipsets.Over the past two years, Qualcomm was hit with antitrust   probes worldwide, which all allege that it charges unfair   licensing fees for its 3G/4G technologies. It was fined $975   million in China, another $854 million in South Korea, and could   face up to $3 billion in additional fines in Europe and   Taiwan. Apple claims that because it cooperated with   authorities in Korea during the investigation, Qualcomm   retaliated by withholding $1 billion in rebate payments -- which   it's now suing to recover.The outcome is anyone's guess...The battle between Qualcomm and Apple will be a long and nasty   one, since it's dependent on many shifting variables. First, the   FTC lawsuit could be dropped if commissioner Maureen K.   Ohlhausen, a Republican who voted against charging Qualcomm that   was just appointed the acting chairwoman by the Trump   Administration, chooses not to follow through. If the case is   dropped, the rebates should remain a valid business arrangement;   but if it isn't, the rebates could be invalidated as ""bribes"" --   which may hurt both companies.Regardless of what happens with the FTC case, Apple   needs to prove that it didn't violate the two main conditions of   its rebate agreement by using Intel modems or aiding the Korean   FTC during its investigation. Apple doesn't deny aiding the KFTC   at all -- it recently told CNN that it was merely   ""responding truthfully to law enforcement agencies"" instead of   ""instigating"" litigation against Qualcomm.Meanwhile, Qualcomm must justify many of its opaque licensing   practices. Qualcomm charges royalties based on a device's   entire value, instead of just the chips in the device -- a   practice that was already blocked by Chinese regulators. It also   charges licensing fees on 3G/4G handsets which don't use any of   its chips, since  those devices still rely on its wireless   technologies -- although Apple argues that some of Qualcomm's   licensed patents don't actually cover those core technologies.   This means that Apple still pays Qualcomm fees on iPhones using   Intel modems (and also the Infineon modems it used in the past),   and that those fees are likely higher due to the lack of   rebates.Understanding the risks to QualcommIf Qualcomm loses its cases against Apple and other   regulators, it could be forced to change its entire licensing   model. That move would cause the QTL (licensing) business'   margins to wither and crush its earnings since the business   generates the lion's share of its profits.It could also jeopardize Qualcomm'splanned acquisitionofNXP Semiconductors(NASDAQ: NXPI) , which would make it the largest automotive   chipmaker in the world while expanding its patent portfolio. If   Qualcomm doesn't close that deal this year, its top line will   remain heavily exposed to the commoditization of the smartphone   market and seemingly endless challenges against its licensing   business.But should you sell Qualcomm?Qualcomm faces plenty of legal headwinds, but I believe that   the sell-off is a knee jerk reaction that has knocked the stock   down to irrational levels. Qualcomm now trades at 14 times   earnings, as opposed to the industry average of 22. It also pays   a forward yield of 3.4%, which is easily supported by a payout   ratio of 53%.As a Qualcomm shareholder, I'm certainly disappointed with   recent developments. But I don't plan to sell my shares unless   the litigation either derails the NXP deal or forces Qualcomm to   dramatically reduce its licensing fees. Until then, I'll still   consider Qualcomm a cheap (albeit riskier) dividend play with   solid growth prospects inadjacent marketslike connected cars, drones, and Internet of Things gadgets.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Qualcomm's Earnings Call Dominated By Apple Lawsuit;January 26, 2017, 05:49:00 PM EDT;"CEO Steve Mollenkopf. Image source: Qualcomm.Mobile chip giantQualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM) reported fiscal first-quarter results last night.   While the results as well as guidance mostly topped analyst   expectations,Apple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) recent lawsuit against the company expectedly   dominated the subsequent earnings call (""Apple"" was mentioned 74   times). For good reason, too, since Apple is widely considered   Qualcomm's largest customer, combined with the fact that the   lawsuit threatens Qualcomm's licensing model.makeArticleAd();Beyond a few brief statements, this is the first time that   Qualcomm has commented publicly and in granular detail regarding   the suit. Here's what management had to say.Prepared remarksCEO Steve Mollenkopf first noted that the two companies have   historically had a strong relationship, and Qualcomm intends to   ""remain a good supplier"" despite the legal complaint. The company   would naturally have preferred to settle its dispute with Apple   in private negotiations instead of litigation, but it remains   confident that it can defend itself in court. Mollenkopf summed   it up: ""Apple's complaint contains a lot of assertions, but in   the end, this is a commercial dispute over the price of   intellectual property. They want to pay less for the fair value   that Qualcomm has established in the marketplace for our   technology, even though Apple has generated billions in profits   from using that technology.""President Derek Aberle continued:Touching briefly on Apple's complaints filed in San Diego     and China, it claims that Qualcomm should be required to     license its cellular standard essential patents, or SEPs, to     modem suppliers. That even when licensing those patents at the     device level, Qualcomm should only be able to charge royalties     on the price of the cellular modem chip inside the device.These positions, however, are inconsistent with     long-standing industry practice, the [intellectual property     rights] policies of the relevant standard-setting bodies, the     realities of licensing large portfolios of patents, and basic     notions of efficiency, fairness in economics.Aberle points out that device-level licensing is utilized   throughout the industry by many major patent holders beyond   Qualcomm. (Apple is seeking chip-level licensing.) Qualcomm says   its patents also contribute to many other features in modern   smartphones beyond cellular connectivity, further justifying   device-level royalties. Shifting to chip-level royalties would   then introduce different layers of licensing for all the various   chips that Qualcomm enables or sells itself, so it licenses the   entire portfolio for the sake of efficiency.Apple says that there is no limit to the royalty rates, which   is why it seeks per-unit royalty relief in the form of ""rebate""   payments. Aberle says this is untrue:In addition, it is well known that Qualcomm has per-unit     running royalty caps as part of its licensing program. This     effectively results in licensees not paying running royalties     as a percentage of the device price above a certain net selling     price of any given device. Apple's claim that royalties are     uncapped is simply incorrect.Aberle also reiterated that Qualcomm believes Apple is   instigating these regulatory attacks as well as providing   inaccurate information:Apple claims that Qualcomm retaliated because Apple     cooperated with government investigations. To be clear, we did     no such thing. We simply objected to Apple making false and     misleading statements and withholding information to motivate     attacks against Qualcomm. We welcome the opportunity to have     Apple's claims heard in court, where we will be entitled to     full discovery of Apple's practices and a robust examination of     the merits. We will prove that Apple's irresponsible claims of     extortion are false.There should be no immediate impact to sales from the lawsuit,   either. Apple still needs modems, and Qualcomm will still supply   them. CFO George Davis said, ""We are not forecasting any impact   to revenues related to the dispute with Apple, as we are   continuing to meet their supply needs in good faith and expect   Apple will continue to meet its obligations.""Questions and answersAs usual, the analyst Q&A often provides more color.   Qualcomm affirmed that Apple does not have a direct license, but   rather an indirect license through its contract manufacturers.   Qualcomm isn't worried about collecting, said Aberle:Apple does not have a direct license with Qualcomm today.     And so the royalties on Apple products that get paid to     Qualcomm are reported and paid by their contract manufacturers.     So although we do have a dispute now with Apple and they are     challenging some of the offers and some of our licensing terms,     the contracts that we have in place with their suppliers remain     valid and enforceable. And we would expect that our licensees     will continue to comply with the terms of their agreements. And     we would also hope and expect that Apple would not interfere     with the terms of those agreements. But of course, we can't     fully control those actions.When asked about the exclusivity and monopoly power   allegations, general counsel Don Rosenberg (who incidentally used   to work for Apple a decade ago), downplayed the idea that   Qualcomm wields monopoly power:With regard to your question about so-called exclusivity     deal, first of all, we -- I think you called this monopoly     power or had monopoly power. We don't believe we have monopoly     power in the chip market or any other market. And nor do we     have an exclusivity arrangement. We have never prevented Apple     or anybody else from buying from competitive chipmakers. And in     the Apple case, it's pretty clear since, as you know, they have     been buying fromIntelfairly recently. So it's a mischaracterization to call it an     exclusive dealing arrangement.This is a little murky, since Applehadbeen exclusively buying basebands from Qualcomm for five years,   and only started buying from Intel after the alleged exclusivity   ended.Overall, Qualcomm thinks Apple is simply trying to finagle   lower payments -- lower being beneath fair value as established   by its hundreds of other licensing deals with many companies over   the years. That risks somewhat oversimplifying Apple's complaint,   because Apple is also accusing Qualcomm of various forms of   anticompetitive behavior. Whether or not those allegations stand   up in court remains to be seen.10 stocks we like better than QualcommWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

BlackBerry Ltd (BBRY) DTEK70: Game-Changer or Non-Event?;January 26, 2017, 12:39:33 PM EDT;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe rumor mill is spinning again withBlackBerry Ltd(NASDAQ:BBRY). Code-named ""Mercury,"" the next BlackBerry device, DTEK70, will reportedly get a Feb. 25 launch date. And BBRY stock holders probably do not care at this point.makeArticleAd();Source:WEi WEi via FlickrBlackBerry is rebranding itself as a software company, but its stock is up a mere 4.3% in the last year. By comparison,Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) is up nearly 25% in the last year whileNokia Corp (ADR)(NYSE:NOK), which exited the Windows Phone market and focused on networking, fell 33%.Still, the DTEK70 release is important for BBRY.BlackBerry and TCL PartnershipBlackBerry outsourced its entire hardware development and manufacturing withTCL. Early signs are positive that ""Mercury"" will win customers, especially in the business space. BlackBerry said that it is 100% indevelopingsoftware solutions. TCL's ""Mercury"" build offers a secure Android operating system and has a physical keyboard. The company earns IP and royalty revenue for each device TCL sells.On its conference call in December, BlackBerrydescribedthe TCL deal:This licensing model allows BlackBerry to generate ongoing high margin royalty revenue from a device software based on the number of units sold. We have a pipeline of additional opportunities that are focusing on, including a late discussion in India that are ongoing.""Decent Price to PerformanceBlackBerry priced the budget DTEK50 in the right range but did not win the mainstream market. DTEK60 demonstrated the company's ability to make a solid, high-performance phone at mainstream prices. DTEK70 is even more practical for business users.Rumoredto run on aQualcomm, Inc.(NASDAQ:QCOM) Snapdragon 635 or Snapdragon 821, the device will have just 4.5 inches of screen real estate.5 Blue-Chip Stocks to Sell in FebruaryThis is the magic number for DTEK70: The device may sell for around just $350. At that price and size, business users who crave for higher productivity will snap up this phone when it is launched.Profit MarginBlackBerry CEO John Chen will not allow the company to sell devices at a loss. Assume profit margins in the range of 25%-50% for TCL. When the costs of software development are included, the profit margin for BBRY may run above 50%-60%.Launch DateOn its blog, BlackBerry said it will give more details about the smartphone at the Mobile World Congress show. The event runs from Feb. 27 to March 3.Interest in ""Mercury""+ ""BlackBerry"" jumped:Click to EnlargeSource:tickertags.comGame Changer or More of the Same?Past BlackBerry Android devices did not give the company much revenue growth. In the third quarter, the $172 million in software services revenue accounted for 57% of the company's revenue.The TCL licensing deal, though, is a game-changer for the software company. DTEK70's development costs are all shouldered by its partner. BlackBerry gets a cut in the sales through the software licensing. High profit margins from software sales will translate to more profits for the company.The one big catch is that BBRY and TCL must advertise and promote this upcoming device. BlackBerry made $12 million in operating income in the third quarter.Profit Model for DTEK 70Assuming TCL pays a 10% royalty on the profits of the $350 device, or $20 per device, BlackBerry could earn the following:Units Sold per quarterProfit100,000  $   2,000,000250,000$ 5,000,000 500,000  $ 10,000,000Selling 500,000 units a quarter would match the company's third-quarter operating income.3 Reasons to Buy Ford Motor Company (F) Stock on This DipBottom Line on BBRY StockThe smartphone market is still wide-open for small players like BlackBerry. Previously released Android devices demonstrated the company could deliver on supplying a highly secure, bug-free operating system. The inexpensive DTEK70 targets the business user.With the rumored price and phone specifications, BlackBerry may have an unexpected winner.As of this writing, Chris Lau was long BBRY.

Should You Buy Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock? 3 Pros, 3 Cons;January 26, 2017, 12:27:55 PM EDT;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIf you bought and held stock inMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) at the height of the dot-com run, it's been an unpleasant 16 years. However, after a long wait, MSFT stock finally reached a new all-time high last month. Despite the tech world changing drastically in the ensuing years, Microsoft's PC dominance lives on, minting money for the company.makeArticleAd();Source:Mike Mozart Via FlickrThe company's various new efforts over the years have mostly been flops. There's a reason Microsoft stock has performed poorly; efforts such as Windows phones simply haven't panned out. However, it seems Microsoft has finally turned the corner.It is making real headway in several promising areas, including its cloud offering. And investors have cheered, sending Microsoft's stock up sharply since 2013. Can the good times continue, or will buyers up at these levels be in for another long decade?MSFT Stock ConsHuge Stock Run-Up: Since 2013, MSFT stock has more than doubled. At first glance, that seems fine, the market has performed strongly in recent years after all. However, Microsoft is so large, that it becomes hard to achieve further such doublings. With a market cap just under $500 billion today, even one more double takes Microsoft to a trillion dollar market cap. It's worth asking what the company has going from a growth perspective that could justify such a lofty figure.Sure, the company has some growth initiatives under way. The cloud offering is going well. And the LinkedIn acquisition may start to bear more fruit. But after watching the stock run from under 30 in recent years to over 60 today, you have to ask how much more upside really makes sense, particularly since the company has had near non-existent revenue growth lately.10 High-Yield Dividend Stocks That Are SOMEHOW Still BargainsHigh Valuation:First things first, MSFT stock isn't really trading at a 30 price-earnings ratio. I know that's what financial websites report. However, that's based on GAAP figures that include one-off losses related to restructuring. On an adjusted basis, Microsoft is trading in the mid-20s, and at 21 times forward earnings. However, even that doesn't paint a flattering picture for the company. Microsoft traded at 12 times earnings or less over much of the past decade. Is Microsoft worth paying twice as much for now?Sure, the PC market has stabilized, but it isn't likely to ever be a meaningful growth driver again. And the newer initiatives such as cloud seem likely to take years to reach strong profitability. At 21 times forward earnings, MSFT stock is pricing in some serious growth prospects that may well not materialize.Questionable Deal-Making:Microsoft has a reputation for making some head-scratching M&A moves. The less said of the aQuantive purchase and the Nokia buy, the better. Those two alone resulted in almost $14 billion of write-offs. And the recent LinkedIn deal raises questions. Microsoft paid $26 billion for LinkedIn, and offered a massive premium to where shares where trading previously. At the price Microsoft paid, it offered around 30x free cash flow for LinkedIn. On an earnings basis, LinkedIn was still losing money.Sure, Microsoft can cut some costs there, particularly for stock-based compensation, but it's still a massive price tag. And with Microsoft having such a huge war chest on its balance sheet, the temptation will surely be there for the company to make other huge value-destructive deals.MSFT Stock ProsPC Market Stabilizing:For quite a few years now, the traditional PC market appeared to be in serious decline. Sales peaked in 2011, with364 million unitssold that year globally. Since then, sales have plunged. By 2015, sales dropped 24% from that peak year, falling to just 275 million units. And 2016 showed another solid decline, with sales reaching just 260 million units. However, the worst may now have passed. 2020 projections are for 250 million units sold, only a fractional decline from current levels.And themost recent datasupports this further moderation: sales slipped just 1.5% versus the same period last year. And in several areas globally, including Canada and Japan, PC sales are actually increasing again. One possible reason, the rate of forward technological progress has slowed for both tablets and smartphones, reducing pressure on consumers to switch to smaller screens. A stable market would be great news for MSFT stock.Partnership With Qualcomm:Microsoft has partnered withQualcomm, Inc.(NASDAQ:QCOM) for their Internet of Things efforts. Qualcomm has entered conflict withIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) at first over the IoT market. In the longer-run, Qualcomm may use its chips to even forcefully attack Intel's long-held dominance in the PC market. In any case, Microsoft benefits nicely from partnering up with Qualcomm.The IoT offerings born from this venture will help spread Windows 10 outside of just the traditional PC market. And given the shellacking that QCOM stock took earlier this week followingApple Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AAPL) lawsuit against the firm, Qualcomm has reason to deepen ties with friendly partners. As an industry outcast, Qualcomm needs whatever help it can get, and if Microsoft can use that to expand Windows as a broader OS, all the better.Solid Dividend Option:Microsoft has quietly turned into a nice yield choice for more conservative investors. The company has tripled its dividend since 2008. In total, it's posted 16%, 18% and 16% dividend growth rates over the past three, five and ten years. While the payout ratio currently looks a little high, that's based on abnormally soft recent earnings. Make no mistake, there is plenty of room left here for more dividend increases. The company has an astounding $137 billion in cash on its balance sheet. Even after subtracting out debt, the company has a net cash position of $62 billion, leaving plenty of firepower for increased dividends, share buybacks or acquisitions.VerdictMSFT stock is a decent selection if you're purely concerned with its yield and safety. The company's main PC business is looking healthier than it has in quite awhile. The balance sheet is tremendous. The dividend is significant at today's level, and is bound to keep rising quickly.Here's Why Chevron Corporation (CVX) Stock Is the Best Play in OilHowever, there's little to recommend Microsoft on valuation. The stock is expensive, even when you look closely. Microsoft has plenty of growth initiatives in the works, but actual operating results recently have only been so-so. When buying stocks at all-time highs, you want to see a business with more operating momentum.At the time of this writing, Ian Bezek held INTC and QCOM stock. He had no position in Microsoft.

"Can Apple's (AAPL) ""Find my Airpod"" Feature Really Help?";January 26, 2017, 10:25:00 AM EDT;"On TuesdayApple Inc. (AAPL)announced its iOS 10.3 update with a special feature, apparently called ""Find my Airpods"", that will help to track misplaced Airpods.Powered by a new W1 chip, the Airpods are in line with Apple's vision of wireless future. Apparently, its best feature seems to be the use of sensors to detect if the plugs have been inserted in both the ears. However, since its launch, Airpod has been a hot topic of discussion on FacebookFBand TwitterTWTRgiven the chances of it being misplaced easily due to its size.Per media reports, Apple's announcement can be seen as an answer to users' request to make a feature that will help them find these small AirPods. Due to its small size, the Airpod cannot accommodate a built-in GPS system. Therefore, the latest feature is tailored to locate misplaced Airpods that are within the Bluetooth range of an iPhone or iPad.Then again, the problem remains that the exact location of the Airpod cannot be determined with the feature and only the last connected location will show up on the connected iOS device, add further media reports. Additionally, the feature is capable of activating a sound from the Airpod to indicate its location. However, these features are useless once the Airpod's battery is exhausted.Apple Inc. Price and ConsensusApple Inc. Price and Consensus|Apple Inc. QuoteApple's fortunes have been tied to its most important offering, the iPhone, which alone contributed about 60% of its total revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016.However, since the last two quarters, the demand for this device has been soft owing to global macroeconomic weakness, especially due to currency volatility and declining commodity prices in some key regions across the globe (about 60% of Apple revenues come from International markets).The Airpod had been one of the key attractions of the iPhone 7 series. Reportedly, since the launch of Airpods in December, Apple has been on the top of the headphone market that boasts names likes SonySNE, Bose, JBL and others. Although Apple has refrained from posting its official sales figures, the market reports indicate positive impact of Airpod sales on first quarter results.In the past one year, Apple's shares are up 19.98%, compared with the ZacksComputer Miniindustry's increase of 21.41%, as of Jan 24.Zacks' Best Private Investment IdeasIn addition to the recommendations that are available to the public on our website, how would you like to follow all Zacks' private buys and sells in real time?Our experts cover all kinds of trades from value to momentum . . . from stocks under $10 to ETF and option moves . . . from stocks that corporate insiders are buying up to companies that are about to report positive earnings surprises.

Broadcom, Valeant Pharmaceuticals, Apple, Amazon and Netflix highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day Broadcom, Valeant Pharmaceuticals, Apple, Amazon and Netflix highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day;January 26, 2017, 09:30:00 AM EDT;"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL - January 26, 2017-Zacks Equity ResearchhighlightsBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO-Free Report)as the Bull of the Day andValeant Pharmaceuticals (NYSE:VRX-Free Report)as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis onApple (NASDAQ:AAPL-Free Report),Amazon(NASDAQ:AMZN-Free Report) andNetflix(NASDAQ:NFLX-Free Report).Here is a synopsis of all four stocks:Bull of the Day:Seems it was only a month ago I writing aboutBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO-Free Report)as the Bull of the Day and explaining why I've been strongly recommending and trading the stock since 2014 from $70.makeArticleAd();And it's true. I did choose AVGO on December 22 when it was trading around $180. Here's how I described this powerhouse technology company in that report...3 Key SegmentsThough Broadcom is generally classified as a semiconductor designer and developer, its solutions serve telecom and enterprise networking customers in the build-out of data centers and high-speed, broadband communications. I can't say for sure ifAT&T,CiscoorAlphabetare customers, but I would be surprised if they weren't.Thus about half of Broadcom's sales come from the Wired Infrastructure segment which has been seeing steady double-digit growth as these big customers transition to the 100 Gigabit Ethernet protocol.Approximately 30% of Broadcom's revenues come from its Wireless Communications division which serves top-end mobile smart-device makers likeApplewith radio frequency (RF) chips, amplifiers, and FBAR technology filters. Broadcom FBAR (Film Bulk Acoustic Resonator) filters are a form of bulk acoustic wave (BAW) filter that have superior performance with steeper rejection curves compared to surface acoustic wave (SAW) filters.The third major segment at Broadcom is Enterprise Storage, which connects back with many customers from the Wired division and supplies just under 20% of revenues. The company's products enable the high-speed movement of digital data with a secure connection among multiple PCs, servers and storage devices such as hard disk drives and solid state drives.While AVGO's Wireless business is ""dependent"" on Apple, that's not exactly a bad problem to have. The coming next wave of 5G technology will keep both companies rolling in sales growth.And Broadcom's largest business, the Wired segment, is very busy meeting the demand of companies building high-speed, broadband networks, especially with the data-hogging loads of video and the storage requirements of the Internet of Things.Bear of the Day:I don't enjoy kicking this once-beloved company when it's down, butValeant Pharmaceuticals (NYSE:VRX-Free Report)has it coming (again) as earnings estimates slip.In the past week, another investment bank revised lower their EPS projection for this year, knocking the the Zacks Consensus down to $5.17 from $5.30.And in the past 90 days, the profit outlook has fallen from $7.70. This puts annual growth at -5.6% after a 2016 that could end up at over -30% ""growth.""This is why VRX shares are in the cellar of the Zacks Rank again.But it doesn't mean you should run out and sell yours only $1 from multi-year lows. The company is still projected to deliver nearly $9.2 billion in sales this year with hundreds of products and steady earners like Jublia and Wellbutrin.The unknown risks are what happens with any legal investigations or the company's massive debt load. The current debt-to-equity ratio is over 7X for this $4.7 billion company and the debt-to-capital ratio may be over 87X.Analysts Weigh In On the Debt IssueOn January 11, Canaccord Genuity analyst Neil Maruoka was encouraged by Valeant's recent moves to address the leverage...""Valeant has taken its first significant steps towards de-levering its balance sheet, announcing the divestiture of Dendreon and several dermatology brands (including CereVe) for combined cash consideration of ~$2.1 billion.""The analyst noted that the downside of this move is that the company may be forced to sell more quality drug franchises like CereVe, thus hurting sales and operating cash flow. ""Following these divestitures, we estimate that Valeant will have total debt of $28.3 billion remaining, representing a leverage ratio of 6.9x forward EBITDA (down from 7.1x previously).""On January 20, Deutsche Bank reiterated their Hold rating on VRX shares and dropped their price target from $24 to $20. Analyst Gregg Gilbert talked about the company's challenges...""We expect VRX to provide its 2017 outlook sometime between now and when it reports 4Q results (date not yet set). Recall that management provided 'hand signals' on its 3Q call in November that revenue and EBITDA would be down in 2017 vs. 2016. In anticipation of this event, we have updated our model to reflect recent developments and management commentary. The key elements of our changes relate to recently-announced divestitures, loss of exclusivity (LOE) for several products in 2016/17, and FX headwinds.""Additional content:Apple 'Hopeful' About Future iPhone Manufacturing in     IndiaOn Wednesday,Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL-Free Report)executives met with government officials of India to discuss plans about manufacturing iPhones in the country.Like many tech corporations-think Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN-Free Report) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX-Free Report) - Apple is eager to begin assembling its iPhone in India, which has become one of the world's fastest growing smartphone markets in recent years. Apple currently only has a tiny market share in the country, and is ready to start bolstering its stagnate global sales. The company even applied to open retail stores in India last year.""We've been working hard to develop our operations in India,"" Apple said in a brief statement. ""We appreciate the constructive and open dialogue we've had with government about further expanding our local operations.""The tech giant's plans to set up an iPhone production plant was initially reported on byTimes of India. The newspaper reported that the factory would be built in partnership with Taiwan-based manufacturer Wistron.According toCNNMoney, India has over 300 million smartphone users, or 18% more than last year. Apple, then, has much to gain if it can build a successful iPhone production plant in the country.

Facebook Inc (FB) Hires Former Google Exec to Lead Oculus;January 26, 2017, 09:23:25 AM EDT;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFacebook Inc's(NASDAQ:FB) virtual reality division Oculus has had a rough six months, but it looks as though the company is ready to to push VR in 2017 and turn things around. CEO Mark Zuckerberg took to Facebook last night to announce thatHugo Barra will be joining FB to lead VR efforts, including Oculus. If the name sounds familiar it should. Barra is very well known in the technology industry.makeArticleAd();Source: FacebookSo who is Hugo Barra? He was in the news just last week when it was revealed he was leaving Chinese consumer technology giantXiaomi.He was hired in 2013 to lead that company's efforts to polish its image in western markets and help push its products into the U.S. market. At the time Barra said he was returning to his Silicon Valley roots, but gave no details.What Does Hugo Barra Bring to FB?Prior to Xiaomi, he served asAlphabet Inc's(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google vice president of Android product management.In his announcement of Barra's hire, Zuckerberg wrote:""I'm excited that Hugo Barra is joining Facebook to lead all of our virtual reality efforts, including our Oculus team. Hugo's in China right now, so here we are together in VR. It seems fitting.I've known Hugo for a long time, starting when he helped develop the Android operating system, to the last few years he's worked at Xiaomi in Beijing bringing innovative devices to millions of people. Hugo shares my belief that virtual and augmented reality will be the next major computing platform.""FB's Oculus ChallengesWhen Facebook bought Oculus for $2 billion in 2014, the prospects for its new virtual reality division seemed limitless. But for the last six months, the division has been struggling.10 Stocks to Buy to Survive a ""Trumpsy-Turvy"" 2017Founder Palmer Luckey was bringing inbad press over his political views, complaints over the highprices for its Oculus Rift headsetand the new Touch Controllers continued, andSony Corp (ADR)(NYSE:SNE) unexpectedly began to gain traction with both consumers and game developers with its much more affordable Playstation VR. In December, Oculus CEO Brendan Iribe stepped down. Now, FB and Luckey aretied up in a lawsuitclaiming the Oculus founder stole trade secrets and violated copyrights in order to develop his Oculus Rift VR headset.On top of all this, the hype over virtual reality is beginning to fade. After being a major part of past Consumer Electronics shows, there was a feeling thatVR wasn't particularly compelling at CES 2017.In short, it's understandable why FB wants to kickstart Oculus. An industry veteran like Hugo Barra -someone who is experienced in leading a critical division in a technology giant and skilled at promotion - may well be the answer.Kickstarting OculusWhen Barra takes over at Oculus, there are a few immediate challenges to take on. The lawsuit will have to be dealt with, but FB lawyers will be able to manage most of that.The bigger issue in terms of getting consumers to buy into the Oculus rift is pricing. The Oculus Rift already has mindshare as the VR headset people think of. But where the Oculus Rift was once pretty much the only game in town, every major consumer technology company - exceptApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) - is offering virtual reality gear, and it's almost always cheaper.Apple Inc. New iPads Might Be Late to the Party (AAPL)That wouldn't be such a big deal if you were looking at $100 versus $75. But an Oculus Rift plus Touch Controllers goes for $798. Then you need a reasonably powerful PC (many computer owners would have to upgrade), which is at least another $1,000. In comparison, a complete Sony Playstation VR system (including the PS4) can be had for about $800. However, the Playstation VR headset is compatible with the original PS4 - which many gamers already own, so that brings their investment to just $500.Largely as a result of those cost differences, it'sestimated Sony will have sold over 745,000 Playstation VR systems in 2016, while projections are for the Oculus Rift to hit just 355,000.The hire of Hugo Barra sets the stage for FB to aggressively promote the technical superiority of its Oculus virtual reality technology over that used by competitors like Sony. It's also a good move in promoting developer relations in an effort to boost the Oculus' lead in compelling VR content. And if he can find some wiggle room to get Oculus Rift pricing down a bit, Barra stands a good chance of turning things around for Facebook's virtual reality division in 2017.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace3 Things Apple Inc.

Apple (AAPL) Q1 Earnings: What's in the Cards this Time?;January 26, 2017, 07:44:00 AM EDT;"Apple, Inc.AAPLis set to report its first-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Jan 31. Last quarter, it posted a 0.60% positive earnings surprise. The company has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 0.11%.Let's see how things are shaping up prior to the announcement.Factors to ConsiderInvestors will be looking forward to sales numbers for iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. iPhone continues to the primary revenue contributor for Apple. Slowdown in the demand for iPhone has emerged as a big concern for Apple. Over the past one year, sales have dipped given overall weakness in the smartphone market, observe analysts. Per analysts, waning demand from markets like China and U.S., which are Apple's biggest markets, has been widely reflected on iPhone sales numbers.Also, competition from local players has been hindering iPhone growth in China. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, Apple iPhone unit sales came in at about 45.5 million, down 5% year over year. Revenues from iPhone also declined 13% from the year-ago quarter to $28.2 billion (60% of total revenue).Plus analysts also observe that the hype surrounding iPhone 8 will also dent sales. iPhone 8 is set to be launched later this year, marking the tenth anniversary of the revolutionary iPhone. It reportedly has amazing features like a glass body, a dual curved edge-to-edge OLED display with a built-in Touch ID sensor and wireless charging. What is more exciting is that Apple is rumored to launch three iPhones (instead of two) including a new 5.8 inch model. All this is likely to put consumers on hold for some more time. iPhone 8 is already dubbed as a ""super cycle"".However, given the troubles in iPhone, Apple has been focused on other drivers like Services, Music and App store to boost revenues. A few days back, Apple announced that its App Store generated sales of more than $20 billion for developers in 2016, up 40% from 2015.  Apple keeps 30% of all App Store sales. Apple stated that its top grossing markets were the U.S., China, Japan. China witnessed growth of over 90% year over year.Apple also announced that Apple Music has crossed 20 million paid users. Apple's Services business is also expected to remain strong as it is mostly dependent on the already installed Apple devices.Plus, it continues to increase focus on emerging markets to boost iPhone sales. In the last few months, Apple has increased its focus on India, which is expected to become the second largest smartphone market in the world. In fiscal 2016, Apple sales in India grew approximately 50% over the prior fiscal. Also, a robust cash position and shareholder friendly policies are long-term positives.For the first quarter of fiscal 2017, Apple forecasts revenues in a range of $76 billion to $78 billion.Gross margin is expected within 38% to 38.5%, while operating expenses are projected within $6.9 billion to $7 billion. Other income/ (expense) is likely to be $400 million, while tax rate is expected to be 26%.Apple Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseApple Inc. Price and EPS Surprise|Apple Inc. QuoteEarnings Whispers?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Apple will beat earnings estimates this season. This is because a stock needs to have both a positiveEarnings ESPand a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Apple has an Earnings ESP of -0.93% as the Most Accurate Estimate is $3.19 while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged higher at $3.22. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with ourEarnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank:Apple's Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or # 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a couple of stocks worth considering that, as per our model, have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Western Digital CorporationWDCwith an Earnings ESP of +12.73% and a Zacks Rank #1.

"Western Digital (WDC) Beats Q2 Earnings; '17 View Positive";January 26, 2017, 07:26:00 AM EDT;"Western Digital Corp.WDCreported second-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of $2.30 per share, which increased 33.7% from the year-ago quarter. Earnings were much better than management's revised guided range of $2.10-$2.15 per share.makeArticleAd();Moreover, including stock-based compensation, earnings were $1.98 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 33 cents. Further, revenues of almost $4.89 billion surged 47.4% year over year and comfortably surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.75 billion.Western Digital witnessed strong demand for both hard drive and NAND-based products from all categories of customers, largely driven by cloud and mobility based applications, as well as better than expected PC demand in the reported quarter.Western Digital Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS     SurpriseWestern Digital Corporation Price, Consensus and   EPS Surprise|Western Digital Corporation QuoteSegment Revenue DetailsClient devices (49.5% of total revenue) surged 52.9% year over year to $2.42 billion. The revenue synergies from SanDisk acquisition benefitted results in the quarter. Management noted that increasing storage capacities in mobile phones and market preference for client SSDs are long-term tailwinds for this business.Client solutions (22% of total revenue) increased a whopping 134.4% to $1.08 billion. Robust holiday season sales drove results. The company noted that the combined revenue contribution from new products such as iXpand and dual USB drives also grew in the quarter.During the quarter, Western Digital announced new retail products including the four terabyte My Passport, eight terabyte My Book for the PC and a new four terabyte hard drive for Apple'sAAPLMacintosh. During the quarter, Western Digital commenced retail shipments and OEM sampling of its 64-layer product.Data center devices and solutions (28.5% of total revenue) increased 9.2% to $1.39 billion on the back of strong demand for high capacity storage devices. Petabyte growth of almost 40% year over year for capacity optimized hard drive was in line with management expectations. Solid adoption of 10 Terabyte third generation Helium drive was also noted in the quarter.During the quarter, Western Digital shipped 44.8 million HDDs at an average selling price (ASP) of $62, up from $61 reported in the year-ago quarter. However, reported shipments of 44.762 million were down from 49.688 million in the year-ago quarter.Western Digital's market share in the total addressable market (TAM) came in at 39.9% compared with 43.2% in the year-ago quarter.Operating DetailsAdjusted gross margin expanded 810 basis points (bps) year over year to 36.4%. The figure was better than management's guidance of 35%. The expansion was driven by lower product cost and pricing improvement.Reported operating expenses, as percentage of revenues climbed 50 bps to 20.2%, owing to 20 bps increase in research and development (R&D) expense and 10 bps growth in selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense.As a result, adjusted operating margin expanded 590 bps to 17.6% in the reported quarter.Interest expense was $224 million a massive increase from $7 million reported in the year-ago quarter.Acquisition SynergiesWestern Digital stated that it is on track to achieve the $800 million of annualized savings from the HGST integration by the end of calendar 2017. The company achieved $175 million of cost of revenue synergies and $300 million of operating expense synergies each on an annual run rate basis at the end of the reported quarter.In terms of SanDisk integration, at the end of second quarter the company realized synergies of approximately $135 million on an annual run-rate basis. This is in line with the company's 18-month target of achieving $500 million of total run rate synergies on an annualized basis.Balance Sheet/Cash FlowAs of Dec 30, 2016, cash and cash equivalents were $4.94 billion up from $4.33 billion as of Sep 30. Long-term debt during the quarter was $12.94 billion down from $13.06 billion at the end of previous quarter.During the quarter, Western Digital generated $1.06 billion in cash from operations compared with $440 million in the previous quarter.GuidanceFor third-quarter fiscal 2017, revenues are expected to remain flat on a sequential basis.Adjusted gross margin is expected to be 38% backed by continued favorable pricing and product mix across the company's businesses. Total operating expenses are expected to be approximately $800 million.Interest expense is anticipated to be almost $205 million.Management expects adjusted earnings to be in the range of $2.00-$2.10 per share for the third quarter.Our TakeWe believe that the shift toward non-PC applications, secular growth of digital data and growing exposure to the small and medium business space are the long-term positives for Western Digital. The company's growing footprint in the automotive as well as the connected home and industrial categories is significantly positive, in our view.We remain encouraged by the company's launch of a string of storage devices under the mobile and cloud segment. Continued investments in product innovation could result in flattish margins in the near term.Further, Western Digital's entry into the wireless devices market comes at a time when storage services related to smartphones and tablets are witnessing large-scale adoption. These factors are anticipated to be growth catalysts, going forward.Moreover, the SanDisk acquisition not only expands Western Digital's offerings in the SSD segment but also provides a competitive edge against peers such as Seagate TechnologySTX.We note that Western Digital shares have outperformed the ZacksComputer Storage Devicesindustry in the past one-year. While shares gained 80.9%, the industry advanced 22.4% in the same period. We expect the momentum to persist given the impressive result and positive guidance in the rest of fiscal 2017.Zacks Rank & Key PicksWestern Digital currently has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Bull of the Day: Broadcom (AVGO);January 26, 2017, 07:00:00 AM EDT;"makeZacksArticleAd();Seems it was only a month ago I writing aboutBroadcom (AVGO)as the Bull of the Day and explaining why I've been strongly recommending and trading the stock since 2014 from $70.And it's true. I did choose AVGO on December 22 when it was trading around $180. Here's how I described this powerhouse technology company in that report...3 Key SegmentsThough Broadcom is generally classified as a semiconductor designer and developer, its solutions serve telecom and enterprise networking customers in the build-out of data centers and high-speed, broadband communications. I can't say for sure ifAT&T(T),Cisco(CSCO), orAlphabet(GOOGL) are customers, but I would be surprised if they weren't.Thus about half of Broadcom's sales come from the Wired Infrastructure segment which has been seeing steady double-digit growth as these big customers transition to the 100 Gigabit Ethernet protocol.Approximately 30% of Broadcom's revenues come from its Wireless Communications division which serves top-end mobile smart-device makers likeApple (AAPL)with radio frequency (RF) chips, amplifiers, and FBAR technology filters. Broadcom FBAR (Film Bulk Acoustic Resonator) filters are a form of bulk acoustic wave (BAW) filter that have superior performance with steeper rejection curves compared to surface acoustic wave (SAW) filters.The third major segment at Broadcom is Enterprise Storage, which connects back with many customers from the Wired division and supplies just under 20% of revenues. The company's products enable the high-speed movement of digital data with a secure connection among multiple PCs, servers and storage devices such as hard disk drives and solid state drives.While AVGO's Wireless business is ""dependent"" on Apple, that's not exactly a bad problem to have. The coming next wave of 5G technology will keep both companies rolling in sales growth.And Broadcom's largest business, the Wired segment, is very busy meeting the demand of companies building high-speed, broadband networks, especially with the data-hogging loads of video and the storage requirements of the Internet of Things.I Have $250... Do I Hear $300?So what has changed in a month to make Broadcom the Bull of the Day again?Simply this: the stock took off over 10% to new highs in the past six sessions as a couple of analysts bolstered their view of this must-own tech ""arms dealer."" While I've been following fund managers into AVGO for nearly 3 years, the growth story is not over.On January 18, RBC Capital analyst Amit Daryanani reiterated his Top Pick rating on AVGO shares and raised his view of the company's long term earnings potential to $17 EPS on the heels of the acquisition of Brocade (BRCD). Here's what he had to say...""Our analysis suggests the underlying EPS power of AVGO increases materially post BRCD (especially assuming they raise $1.5-2.0B from networking & real estate sales). We think AVGO could achieve >$17.00 of EPS by FY19 (prior $16) and the stock should work in an upside scenario to $250+.""Oddly, the analyst did not raise his existing price target from $200.So we'll leave that to a bolder fan of the company...On January 24, Morgan Stanley analyst Craig Hettenback raised his price target on Broadcom to $240 from $210, and obviously reiterated his Overweight rating. Here's the MS view...""Increasing our PT to $240 from $210 and highlighting a bull case valuation of $300. Our PT is based on a 15X P/E on CY18 EPS, representing a turn increase from the current multiple but still a conservative 20% discount to the high end Semiconductor peers and 15% below the market. AVGO's multiple has been flat (100% of stock appreciation has been driven by growth in EPS) compared to a roughly 2x turn increase in semiconductor stocks, with investors unwilling to pay up for acquired growth.""However, we now have increased conviction that clearer focus on its outperforming core business, materially higher cash returns and ongoing margin expansion will drive a re-rating over the next 6-12 months.""The combination of Avago and Broadcom is unmatched in Networking (40% sales) in our view, which has positive implications for both growth (share gains) and profitability. We also think the company remains well positioned in RF to exploit the next growth driver of carrier aggregation, leveraging its leadership in premium filters and multiplexers.""The AVGO CampaignAnd there you have an update on the continuing saga that I call ""The AVGO Campaign."" It tells you what works and makes you money in a bull market: finding earnings momentum winners that you know institutions will continue to buy until the cycle ends.Consider AVGO your ""playbook stock"" for how to use the Zacks Rank to swing trade fundamentally-strong companies quarter after quarter.You can find out more by following me in myTAZR Traderservice.Zacks' best stocks under $10As a Zacks Rank #1 Strong Buy, today's Bull of the Day has a short-term 1 to 3-month profit zone.

With market capitalizations in the hundreds of billions   of dollars, investors all over the world will be watching   closely. Ahead of their earnings releases, here's a brief   overview of some keys areas to watch.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();Alphabet: How about that new Google-branded     hardware?With its fourth quarter including the launch of some important   new Google-branded hardware, investors should look for an update   from management on how the products performed during the quarter.   In October, Alphabet launched its Google Pixel smartphone and a   Google Home voice-activated smart speaker. Yes, the bulk of the   company's revenue will still come from its search and advertising   business, but a high-performing hardware could signal growth   potential.On average, analysts are expecting Alphabet to report   fourth-quarter revenue and non-GAAP EPS of $25.18 billion and   9.64, respectively. These results would be up 18% and 11%   compared to the year-ago quarter.Alphabet reports results after market close on Thursday, Jan.   26.Beyond looking to Alphabet's Google-branded hardware and the   company's financial results, investors may want to take the time   to look atthe trajectory of the company's paid clicks and   cost per click-- two important metrics for Alphabet's core search business.iPhone 7. Image source: Apple.Apple: Will guidance point to growth or     decline?When Apple reports results for its first fiscal quarter of   2017 (or the fourth calendar quarter of 2016), one key area to   watch will be the company's guidance. While Apple is expecting   its first-quarter revenue to be slightly higher than in the   year-ago quarter, ending an unfortunate streak of three quarters   of year-over-year declines, it's not clear whether the company   can sustain growth throughout fiscal 2017.Analysts are expecting Apple to report first-quarter revenue   and EPS of $77.4 billion and $3.22. This compares to revenue and   EPS of $75.9 billion and $3.28 in the year-ago quarter.Apple reports its financial results after market close on   Tuesday, Jan. 31.To get a closer look at the metrics that will matter when   Apple reports first-quarter results, here's a more comprehensiveearnings preview.Facebook: Is revenue growth about to slow?The key thing for Facebook investors to watch when the world's   largest social network reports fourth-quarter results will be the   degree to which revenue growth decelerates. Facebook CFO David   Wehner has been warning that revenue growth rates are going to   begin coming down. Of course, with revenue increasing a whopping   56% year over year in Facebook's third quarter, even a meaningful   deceleration in its fourth quarter will still likely represent   big growth for the company.Image source: The Motley Fool.Analysts are looking for Facebook to report revenue and   non-GAAP EPS of about $8.49 billion and $1.31, up about 45% and   66%, respectively. Therefore, analysts do expect Facebook's   business growth to decelerate, but not too significantly.Facebook reports fourth-quarter results after market close on   Wednesday, Feb. 1.For a more in-depth overview of what to expect from Facebook's   earnings report, check out thisearnings preview.Stay tuned at The Motley Fool for more coverage of these   companies throughout earnings season.Find out why Facebookis one of the 10 best stocks to buy nowMotley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more   than a decade beating the market.

Qualcomm (QCOM) Earnings: Why QCOM Stock Is A Buy;January 25, 2017, 05:19:42 PM EDT;"Shares of Qualcomm (QCOM) are edging lower in the after-market session Wednesday, down about 1.3% even though the wireless chip giant reported fiscal first quarter earnings beat Wall Street estimates. Despite the bottom-line miss, its tough to ignore the potential value QCOM stock presents.Indeed, Qualcomm is facing some battles. Still, I would place a bet here on QCOM shares, which are priced at just 12 times fiscal 2017 estimates of $4.74 per share. Trading in the after-hour session at around $55, QCOM stock should reach $62 to $65 in the next 12 to 18 months delivering 18% returns. And the gains could go higher assuming its legal battle with Apple (AAPL) gets resolved, as I expect it will.The companys guidance, for instance, underscores the extent to which the management remains focus on execution. For the second quarter, Qualcomm is forecasting adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $1.15 to $1.25. This compares favorably toThomson Reuters forecast of about $1.20 a share. This make Qualcomm  from a valuation perspective  easy to like at current levels. Ill get back to that in a moment. Lets go through he numbers.makeArticleAd();Forthe quarter that ended December, the San Diego-based company reported a net income of $700 million, or 46 cents a share, down from $1.5 billion, or 99 cents a share, a year earlier. On an adjusted basis, when taking out one-time gains and costs, the company would have earned $1.19 a share, which beat analysts estimates by a penny. First quarter revenue rose 4% year over year to $6 billion, but fell shy on estimates of $6.12 billion.We are pleased with the strong start to our fiscal year and the year-over-year earnings growth across both our semiconductor and licensing businesses, said CEO Steve Mollenkopf in a staement. Looking ahead, the pending NXP acquisition accelerates our strategic transformation in the high growth areas of automotive, IoT, security and networking. We are very well positioned to lead as the semiconductor engine for the intelligent, connected world.Revenue in the licensing business (Qualcomm Technology Licensing (QTL)), which sells sells applications processors and cellular baseband devices, grew 13% year over year to $1.8 billion, while QCT revenue, which exists to monetize Qualcomm immense IP portfolio, came in at $4.1 billion. These gains offset revenue in Mobile station modem (MSM) chip shipments, which includes the Snapdragon LTE modem, which declined 10% year over year $217 million.Ahead of the quarter, analysts were also looking to see if the company discusses its $38 billion purchase of Dutch chipmaker NXP Semiconductor (NXPI). Qualcomm said it expects the transaction  subject to regulatory approval  to close by the end of 2017. Whats more, the company said during the quarter,  $1.2 billion was returned to shareholders through a combination of buybacks and dividends."
Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Q2 Earnings Preview;January 25, 2017, 04:29:30 PM EDT;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) stock has had an impressive run over the past few years. Heading into Thursday's fiscal second quarter earnings report, MSFT stock is right near an all-time high, having increased about 150% over the past few years.Source:Via MicrosoftWhat's interesting about the gains for such a large stock - MSFT is the third-most valuable company on U.S. markets, behind onlyApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) andAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL) - is that they haven't been based on Microsoft earnings. Microsoft's EPS was $2.73 in fiscal 2012, and $2.79 in fiscal 2016.makeArticleAd();Rather, the multiple investors assign to MSFT stock has expanded. It has more than doubled, in fact.That multiple expansion has come from increasing confidence toward Microsoft'sfutureearnings potential, most notably in mobile and cloud. Where investors four to five years ago saw a fading giant whose earnings were likely to decline, Microsoft now looks like a sleeping giant. And investors clearly believe the company's self-described ""mobile first, cloud first"" strategy is going to push Microsoft earnings up - at some point.It's in that context that the market will analyze the Microsoft earnings report due on Thursday.Microsoft's Growth Isn't ThereYetIt's always dangerous for an investor to believe that the numbers don't matter, but in the case of MSFT stock, the numbers really aren't the most important thing right now.10 Stocks to Buy to Survive a ""Trumpsy-Turvy""     2017Analyst consensus - informed in large part by Microsoft earnings guidance - doesn't predict a particularly impressive second quarter earnings report. The Street expects EPS to rise just a penny year-over-year, which given share repurchases, implies that Microsoft's total net profits actually will be lower in Q2 FY17 than they were ago.  Revenue is estimated to fall almost 2% year-over-year.Microsoft's guidance projects growth in its Productivity & Business and Intelligent Cloud segments, but a sharp decline in More Personal Computing.That shouldn't be surprising. Office 365 growth has helped business revenue, and the Azure platform continues to be a worthy, if still much smaller, competitor to Amazon Web Services in cloud. It's the potential for success in those products that has offset fears about continuing pressure on revenue from Windows, as PC sales decline and mobile usage increases.Indeed, the gain in MSFT stock from $27 to $63 has come mostly from the transition.The fears of Windows losses that led MSFT stock to be valued around 10x EPS in 2013 have turned to optimism toward growth in Azure, Office 365, Enterprise Mobility and other areas. That optimism has pushed the same stock to be valued at about 21x FY17 earnings.So it seems unlikely that investors will focus on the major headline numbers coming out of the Microsoft earnings report. A beat or miss of a penny or two on earnings likely isn't going to drive the market's reaction to the report - particularly if that weakness comes from Windows. Rather, the focus is going to be on the growing, smaller, businesses, most notably Azure.There's a reason Microsoft has steadily expanded its disclosure around Azure and cloud growth: That's where investor attention has been. And it seems likely that's where investor attention will stay coming out of the Q2 Microsoft earnings report.What to Watch For in Microsoft EarningsInvestors seem likely to have some patience with a modest miss in the Microsoft earnings report, as expectations remain relatively low. The company still is getting out from under its deal withNokia Corp (ADR)(NYSE:NOK), and layoffs this year should provide a boost to margins over the next few quarters. Wall Street in particular isn't expecting growth to pick up until fiscal 2018, where sales are projected to grow more than 6% against a rate under 2% in fiscal 2017.So what seems to be important in the Q2 Microsoft earnings report is whether the base of that growth is intact.While Azure is estimated to generate just 3% of total revenue,accordingto analyst firm MKM Partners, its growth rate certainly will be watched closely. After a 140% increase in Q2 FY16, and 116% last quarter, any slowdown seems likely to hurt the stock. But another 100%-plus figure would give further evidence that Azure is a worthy competitor to AWS, and support the current MSFT stock price.The cloud business as a whole - including Office 365 and Dynamics, which is trying to take share fromSalesforce.com, Inc.(NYSE:CRM) - will be another area of post-earnings analysis.Here's Why Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock     Will Hit $75What does that mean for Microsoft stock coming out of the Microsoft earnings report?Overall, it means that the quarter seems likely to be judged more on ""feel"" than on the hard numbers. Even though cloud and mobile still aren't the majority of MSFT revenue or earnings, they are the cornerstones of the Microsoft strategy going forward. And for now, it's relatively clear that the market is content to wait for those sales and profits - as long as it continues to trust in that strategy.If Microsoft can deliver another earnings report that shows growth is on the horizon, MSFT stock likely will rise - even if the headline numbers aren't perfect. But if there's any sort of stumble in either cloud or mobile, that investor patience could reverse - quickly.As of this writing, Vince Martin did not hold a position in   any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 High-Yield Dividend Stocks That Are SOMEHOW     Still Bargains7 Straight-A Stocks to Build Your Portfolio     AroundMicrosoft Corporation (MSFT) Is Building an AI     MonsterThe postMicrosoft Corporation (MSFT) Q2 Earnings Previewappeared first onInvestorPlace."
3 ETF Myths And 4 Trading Tips From The Man Who Helped Launch SPY;January 25, 2017, 04:25:07 PM EDT;"Why is SPDR S&P 500 (SPY), beloved of so many investors in exchange traded funds, like an   Apple (AAPL) iPhone? In both cases, the teams who helped launch the products   did not anticipate they would revolutionize an industry.""When we designed SPY, we had no idea how flexible the ETF   vehicle would turn out to be,"" Jim Ross, chairman of the global   SPDR business at State Street Global Advisors, said Tuesday at   the 10th annual Inside ETFs conference in Hollywood, Fla. ""We   could not have imagined all the innovative ways ETFs are being   used today.""Ross, who was part of the team that launched SPY 24 years ago,   made that point as he drew a parallel between the iPhone's impact   on the technology industry and ETFs' transformation of the   investment landscape.makeArticleAd();As U.S. ETFs enter their 25th year, the ETF industry is   cheering both the fact that this investment vehicle holds a total   of more than $2 trillion in assets and that ETFs represent less   than 5% of the investable market - meaning, there's still plenty   of room to grow.ETFs certainly continue to be on a hot growth streak. ""ETF   assets have roughly doubled every three years over the past   decade,"" Ross said at a conference session titled ""The ETF   Revolution And What's Next For ETFs."" He said that there is no   reason why global ETF assets cannot cross $16 trillion by 2025 at   the continued annual growth rate of 19%.Driving demand for, and innovative use of, ETFs are a host of   insurance companies, ETF strategists, sovereign wealth funds,   wealth management firms and even mutual funds, he added.But Ross also pointed out that risks tied toETF   investinginclude a persistent lack of understanding about these   investment vehicles. In his afternoon address, he sought to   debunk common myths about ETFs and offered some tips for trading   ETFs.Myth 1:""ETF liquidity (issues) could blow up the fixed-income   market."" Despite this common perception, ETFs comprise less than   1% of the total fixed-income market, Ross said. That makes it   unlikely they will ""blow up"" an entire market.In fact, Ross believes fixed-income ETFs can be more efficient   than other fixed-income products, as assets in them have   continued to increase to more than $400 billion today. And   although the underlying fixed-income market can be opaque,   fixed-income ETFs offer transparency in terms of trading costs   and portfolio holdings, he added.Myth 2:""ETFs gone wild."" Referring to the belief that the   proliferation of ETFs can harm investors, Ross said he believes   ETF issuers like his own company are diligent about making sure   new launches meet existing needs. Even a crudely constructed ETF,   he added, displays the American value of ""take an idea to market   and test it out.""The lesson here, Ross said, is that ""all ETF investors need to   understand what they are buying, when they are buying.""Myth 3:""ETFs fail to track intrinsic value in volatile markets.""   According to Ross, ETFs have in some cases helped the process of   price discovery in challenging markets.""That happened on Aug. 24 (2015),"" he said. ""SPY traded   efficiently throughout the day"" despite the extreme volatility inthe stock marketthat day.Ross noted, too, that following that day's tradingdisruptions in some stocks and ETFs, an ETF industry coalition took action to harmonize exchange   rules to address the issue.The lesson here, Ross added, is to understand ETF trading   basics:1. If you don't have to trade in volatile markets, don't.2. Don't trade near the market open. Volatility tends to be   high as the markets price in the news.3. Use limit orders. These are generally seen to have   advantages over market orders in terms of price control and   protection.4. Reconsider the use of stop orders. As many ETF investors   unhappily discovered on Aug. 24, stop orders become market orders   once the price is hit. And they run the risk of selling for much   below their intended price in serious market disruptions.A stop order is an order to buy or sell a stock once the price   of the stock reaches a specified price. A limit order is an order   to buy or sell a stock at a specified price or better.Introducing Ross to the audience, Inside ETFs CEO Matt Hougan   made note of Ross' leadership role in the industry for more than   two decades.""There's a reason everyone loves him,"" Hougan said. ""He's the   chairman of the ICI (Investment Company Institute) ETF committee.   He does education everywhere he can.""The Inside ETFs conferenceconcludes Wednesday.RELATED:The 'Trump ETFs' Spotlighted As 6 Best     Investment Ideas For 2017"
Tech Stock Roundup: AAPL-QCOM Deal, FB's Zuckerberg Testifies;January 25, 2017, 04:17:00 PM EDT;"With the 45thPresident of the United States vowing to bring back jobs to the country, teach China a lesson and institute large-scale tax reform, there has been a great deal of uncertainty surrounding technology stocks. To make matters worse, President Trump has an axe to grind with AmazonAMZNand AppleAAPLwhile most AlphabetGOOGLexecutives have openly supported the democrats going into the elections.So companies are now making nice with the President like Tesla's Elon Musk, who has changed tunes and is now tweeting his support. It's been reported that Google's Schmidt has also found reasons to visit the President. Executives that have supported Trump from the start are better off: some speculate that Zuckerberg is considering politics while ex-MicrosoftMSFTand GM employee Chris Liddell is moving to the White House as assistant to the President and director of strategic initiatives. Oracle CEO Safra Catz joined the executive committee of Trump's presidential transition team in December.Then there's Cramer, promising us that the post inauguration sell-off won't last and that it's actually an opportunity to buy stocks.Amidst all the excitement surrounding the swearing in, the FTC sued QualcommQCOMfor anti-competitive practices while Mark Zuckerberg took the stand to defend Facebook'sFBpurchase of Oculus. So let's dig in.Apple Forced to Use Qualcomm ChipsFollowing similar lawsuits, huge fines ($1 billion in China and $890 million in Korea) and anticompetitive investigations in Taiwan and the EU, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has sued Qualcomm for ""de facto exclusive deals that were as effective as express purchase requirements and that effectively foreclosed Qualcomm's competitors from gaining processor business at Apple.""The FTC alleges that Qualcomm allowed Apple billions in discounts for exclusively using its chips and not using the competing 4G Wi-Max standard that Intel was pushing. This agreement, running from 2011 to 2016, ultimately killed WiMax. Apple wasted no time in sourcing from Intel after the expiry of the agreement in Sep 2016.Another point in contention is Qualcomm's practice of limiting access to its cellular chips and then hiking royalty payments, amounting to ""a tax on the manufacturers' use of baseband processors manufactured by Qualcomm's competitors."" The FTC filed the lawsuit after a 2-1 vote. Qualcomm has of course denied the charges while Apple chose not to comment.Following the FTC lawsuit, Apple filed one of its own against Qualcomm for a billion dollars. The amount is what Apple alleges that Qualcomm is witholding for rebates. Like the FTC says, the deal was to keep Qualcomm chips in Apple products and is a fair indication that Qualcomm finally has some real competition.Mark Zuckerberg TestifiesFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg took the stand last week to deny charges that Facebook was aware of the violation of any employee agreement between Occulus head John Carmack and its former employer id Software, a unit of ZeniMax, the plaintiff in this case. He also denied that the technology developed by the startup Occulus and its founder Palmer Luckey was based on copyrighted technology belonging to ZeniMax.Carmack previously testified that he copied files from ZeniMax before moving to Occulus but did not use the information in Occulus and the terms of his employment allowed him to get involved with Occulus even while in ZeniMax employ. But the thing that could cost Facebook at this point is ZeniMax lawyer Toni Sammi's question: ""So your plan for a $2-point-something billion deal was to begin legal diligence on Friday, and sign the deal on Monday, over a weekend, right?"" to which Zuckerberg said, ""Yeah.""CompanyLast WeekLast  6 MonthsAAPL+2.09%+21.62%FB+0.33%+6.42%YHOO-0.14%+10.80%GOOGL-0.16%+9.94%MSFT+0.21%+16.26%INTC+0.63%+5.38%CSCO+0.20%+0.64%AMZN-0.65%+9.82%Other stories you might have missed-CorporateIndia Considering Apple Case: It's hard to tell just how badly India wants Apple to manufacture in the country. But if government officials agree to Apple's demands, it would indicate that they want it bad. Because Apple has asked for just about every concession possible, ranging from reduction in import duties on smartphones, customs duty exemption on manufacturing equipment and raw materials, a ""less-intrusive"" customs procedure to be completed in 30 minutes, the right to import and refurbish iPhones that are more than 3 years old so they can be exported, and so forth.Apple is trying to convince government officials that Indian made iPhones won't be competitive unless they give in to these demands even as its manufacturing costs in China are on the rise. But Asian phone makers are already manufacturing in the country with no such concessions, so the regulations themselves may need to be altered and relaxed to accommodate not just Apple but also other manufacturers. This could take time.On a positive note, Reuters reports that Information Technology Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad has mentioned the setting up of a government panel headed by the cabinet secretary that would now clear investment proposals in the electronics sector above $1 billion, instead of them going through multiple government departments.Microsoft Executive Joins Baidu: Baidu has appointed Qi Lu as its Chief Operating Officer and Group Head as it turns focus to artificial intelligence as the next growth driver. The company was mixed up in a scandal involving medical ads that led to stricter government regulations and consequently hit its revenues.Lu left Microsoft last year on health concerns but was in charge of its search business and also part of the team involved in architecting its artificial intelligence and bots technology. He holds more than 40 U.S. patents.Google Ad Auctions Are Suspect: The Wall Street Journal has independently confirmed that ads for Google products and the products of its sister companies usually find the top spot on the search engine results page. On checking 25K search results, it found that Google products occupied the top spot 91% of the time and the top two spots 43% of the time.Google has said that this is because it is also a buyer of ads, so its position comes from paying a higher price. It also says that this doesn't raise prices because when others bid for the price, it's as if Google isn't bidding. Bottom line: other advertisers lose the top spot no matter what they bid for it. Google reportedly removed its ads in a number of cases when confronted with the data last December.Amazon, Apple End Audiobook Exclusivity Deal: Apple and Amazon have decided to end the deal initiated back in 2008, according to which Amazon subsidiary Audible became the exclusive supplier of audiobooks to Apple and was barred from selling to any other party. The agreement was actually serving no one because the market for audiobooks has advanced since then and it's now in the interest of both parties to be able to source from others and in Audible's case, to also be able to sell on other platforms. Nonetheless, it was preceded by regulatory scrutiny of the deal by German and EU competition authorities that felt it was inflating prices.Pandora Shares Gain: Pandora preannounced fourth-quarter results that it said exceeded its revenue and EBITDA targets. This came as a relief because it has been lowering expectations the last two quarters indicating continuing bad news. Moreover, Pandora also said that the $5-a-month Pandora Plus garnered 365K new subscribers in the quarter and the Pandora Premium service remained on track to launch later this quarter. It also expects to lay off around 7% of the U.S. workforce, which will further boost margins.Legal/RegulatoryCisco-Arista Developments: The U.S. Customs and Border Patrol agency has expressed concern that its earlier decision to lift the ban on Arista switches may have been incorrect. Following conversations with CiscoCSCO, the CBP therefore intends to reinstate the ban. Arista has said that it will respond to Cisco points and re-engage with the CBP.In the meantime, U.S.-manufactured switches will have to make do, which can result in supply glitches and pressure on its gross margin. On Dec 2, the ITC judge ruled that Arista patents infringe on Cisco's and Arista has subsequently produced workaround while denying the charges. A full commission review of the judge's decision will be completed by Apr 9.New Technology/ProductsGoogle to Launch Android One Phones In U.S.: Google's high-end Pixel phones are mostly unavailable, but it's already gearing up to launch the low-end ($200-$300) Android One devices in the country by the middle of the year. The goal seems to be to build brand value and familiarize people with the Android ecosystem.Android One was first launched in India and later in other countries including Japan and then Europe. It is a system under which Google agrees beforehand with handset manufacturers to push out Android updates as soon as they are available so the experience is true to the latest iteration of the software.M&A and CollaborationsHPE Buying Simplivity: Hewlett Packard Enterprise is dishing out $650 million to buy SimpliVity, the second largest provider of hyperconvergence software (after Nutanix which has over 50% market share). The company describes a hyperconverged system as one that integrates compute, storage and networking into a pre-configured system, managed by a user-friendly software platform that doesn't require extensive IT staff for set up and management.Within a couple of months after the deal closes, HPE will offer a range of integrated HPE SimpliVity hyperconverged systems based on HPE ProLiant Servers. The acquisition significantly strengthens its position in the space where competitors like Cisco and Dell/EMC base their hyperconvergence solutions on market leader Nutanix or Simplivity software. HPE will initially support current SimpliVity customers.Cisco, Ericsson Join Forces in Australia: The collaboration between Ericsson and Cisco on telecom cloud infrastructure has yielded a major customer in Vodafone Hutchison Australia (VHA). The companies will virtualize Vodafone's infrastructure, enabling it to improve customer service and user experience while increasing network agility, reducing opex and capex, and speeding up the deployment of services. The partnership has reportedly generated 60 new deals and is expected to generate revenue of a billion dollars to each partner by 2018.Microsoft Acquires Simplygon: Microsoft has acquired 3D data optimization specialist Simplygon of Sweden for an undisclosed sum. This is intended to play an important role in developing its 3D For Everyone strategy, which is part of the Windows 10 Creators Update. 3D optimization is used by game developers and others to facilitate 3D content creation.Simplygon also does more than this: it has already started optimizing content for AR and VR technology, including for Microsoft's Hololens. Microsoft believes that by making the technology a part of its creators update, users will be empowered to capture, create and share 3D content thus augmenting their productivity, collaboration and creativity.Google Buys Twitter Developers Platform: Google has acquired Fabric, which is based on Crashlytics technology (crash analytics, app feedback and real-time analytics) that Twitter acquired back in 2013. Google hasn't said how much it's paying for Fabric, but has said that it will be a part of its cloud based mobile software effort called Firebase that was itself acquired in 2014. Firebase offers mobile app developers tools to build and monitor their apps, so any attempt to build its capabilities should help the company attract developers.Alibaba Has Long-term Digital Deal: Alibaba and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) signed a deal, according to which Alibaba will be responsible for the IOC's digital presence through its cloud platform. The deal makes Alibaba the digital sponsor of the Olympics in cloud services, e-commerce and television for a period running through 2028. While immediate returns may not there, this lends credibility to the service and should help Alibaba win big customer accounts.WDC Considering Toshiba Stake: Nikkei Asian Review has reported that Toshiba is looking to spin off or sell off a 20% stake in its chip business in which case Western Digital might be the one picking it up. Toshiba is in trouble right now as it has to deal with an unprofitable nuclear business and accounting scandal that requires it to cough up some cash. Selling off a share to its longtime partner Western Digital (the two operate a flash memory fab in Japan) might be just the answer it needs.Some NumbersUK App Store Prices Up: As a result of the pound's continued declines, Apple has been compelled to raise App store prices by as much as 25%.Intel Invests in Retail Tech: At the National Retail Federation's annual conference in New York, Intel said that it intended to invest $100 million in retail technology over the next five years. It also announced the Intel Responsive Retail Platform, which uses a combination of sensors, software kits and other hardware solutions to provide ""in-the-moment information about what customers are buying, what they want and how to manage inventory so it arrives just in time for customers to take it home"".Companies That Reported Results Last Week: CHKP, NFLX, PLXS, IBM, SWKSSome Companies Reporting This Week: CA, XLNX, FFIV, DST, AVT, YHOO, TXN, BABA, EBAY, LRCX, TER, GOOGL, KLAC, PYPL, IBM, SWKS, SIMO, GLW, STX, WDC, INTC, MSFT, JNPR, AMCC, VMW, SYNAZacks' Best Investment Ideas for Long-Term   ProfitToday you can gain access to long-term trades with double and triple-digit profit potential rarely available to the public.

Qualcomm Messed With the Wrong Customer;January 25, 2017, 03:41:00 PM EDT;"Image source: Apple.""Let me get this straight. You think that your client, one     of the wealthiest, most powerful men in the world, is secretly     a vigilante who spends his nights beating criminals to a pulp     with his bare hands. And your plan is to blackmail this     person?""makeArticleAd();-- Lucius Fox,The Dark KnightIn Christopher Nolan'sThe Dark Knight(2008), an accountant discovers Batman's true identity by   uncovering some accounting irregularities at Wayne Enterprises,   but imaginary CEO Lucius Fox quickly puts an end to the   blackmailer's plan by pointing out how absurd it is.Qualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM) may not have been blackmailingApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) all these years, but Apple thinks Qualcomm is   guilty of a similar crime: extortion. In itsU.S. lawsuitfiled last week, Apple alleges that Qualcomm ""attempted to extort   Apple"" into changing how it responded to a regulatory antitrust   investigation in South Korea. The iPhone maker also argues that   it has been paying ""extortion-level royalties"" for years, due to   Qualcomm's ""no license, no chips"" policy where Qualcomm would only sell chips to customers that   agreed to onerous licensing terms.It seems as if Qualcomm has been getting away with this for   years, which is why its market power has grown so dramatically as   rivals fell by the wayside and exited the baseband processor   market. Most customers lack the operating scale, legal resources,   and financial incentive to effectively stand up to Qualcomm   through protracted litigation. Apple doesn't.Apple bites backSo let me get this straight, Qualcomm: You think that your   biggest customer, one of the wealthiest, most powerful   corporations in the world that also has a reputation forsqueezing its supplierswould quietly accept your oppressive contract terms and   never fight back. And your plan is to extort this company?In no uncertain terms, it worked for many years, and   Qualcomm's revenue skyrocketed over the past decade.QCOM Revenue (Quarterly)data byYCharts.Broader smartphone adoption was the main factor, but the   iPhone pulled an awful lot of that weight, too -- both directly   and indirectly (Android was created largely in response to the   iPhone). More specifically, from 2011 to late 2016, Qualcomm had   extracted both exclusivity in supplying Apple with cellular   baseband modems as well as its silence. You may note in the chart   above how much sales increased during this time period. Apple was   restricted from actively complaining to law enforcement and   regulators, although it was allowed to respond if asked. So long   as Qualcomm maintained its lock on baseband chipsets, it had   incredible leverage and there wasn't a whole lot Apple could   do.EnterIntel(NASDAQ: INTC) . Intel had been trying to crack the baseband   market for years with little to no success. Even today, Intel's   modems are technologically inferior to Qualcomm's, but they're   good enough and much cheaper, and Intel expects to catch up   within a few generations. The combination of Qualcomm's   exclusivity ending combined with Intel's ability to supply a   sufficiently competitive modem is the perfect storm for Apple to   unleash its pent-up discontent in court. The $1 billion that   Qualcomm is withholding was just the final straw.Now that Apple has a path to an alternative supplier (even   though the majority of its basebands still come from Qualcomm)   and is no longer contractually obligated to keep quiet, Apple is   bringing a brutal suit against Qualcomm thatthreatens Qualcomm's very business model. You know it's serious when Apple is litigating, givenCEO Tim Cook's hatred of litigation. Did Qualcomm really think that Apple would never retaliate?The moral of the story: Don't extort Apple, and don't   blackmail Batman.10 stocks we like better than QualcommWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Intel Corporation Thinks It Can Catch Up to Qualcomm, Inc. in Modems;January 25, 2017, 02:58:00 PM EDT;"The launch of theApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) iPhone 7-series smartphones market what was,   arguably, the most significant design win that microprocessor   giantIntel(NASDAQ: INTC) had ever scored in smartphones.Image source: Intel.makeArticleAd();A large portion of Apple's iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus   smartphones include Intel's XMM 7360 cellular modem, and the   chipmaker seems to be working hard to ensure that it builds   compelling enough products to continue to win future iPhone   business.At a recent investor conference, the head of Intel's Client   Computing Group, Navin Shenoy, spent some time talking about the   company's investments in and strategies related to cellular   modems. In this column, I'd like to go over the salient points of   that discussion.A ""strategic investment""Shenoy began by saying that cellular modems represent a   ""strategic investment"" for the chipmaker.""We do think that as the world gets more smart and connected,   you're going to need modems -- it's going to be a core   intellectual property, much like graphics was 10 years, 15 years   ago,"" for Intel, he explained.Autonomous vehicles stand to benefit from cellular   connectivity. Image source: Intel.Shenoy went on to say that modems are going to be important in   many of the key areas that Intel wants to participate in,   including personal computers, cars, smartphones, and ""other   [Internet of things] applications.""One modem a year keeps Apple interestedThe executive reiterated a commitment that other Intel   executives have made in the past -- Intel intends to release new   cellular modems each year. He also said that the company's next   generation cellular modem, branded the XMM 7480, is scheduled to   go into ""high-volume manufacturing"" during 2017. The 7360 entered   mass production in 2016.Image source: Apple.Considering that Apple is pretty much the only major buyer of   Intel's cellular modems, it's clear that Intel is aiming to   deliver new modems on this schedule so that its chips are ready   to go for when Apple launches new smartphones each fall.Modem manufacturing strategyIt's well known that all the modems that Intel has released   thus far haven't been manufactured by Intel -- they're designed   by Intel and manufactured by third parties.Shenoy declined to comment on where Intel will be   manufacturing the next-generation XMM 7480 -- or, as he was quick   to point out, future modems -- but made it clear that Intel's   manufacturing choices would be made on a ""pragmatic basis"" and   that the company is evaluating both in-house manufacturing as   well as external options for future modems.Catching up with the market leaderQualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM) is known for being the leading manufacturer of   cellular modems, but Shenoy did take the opportunity to brag a   little bit about the company's recently announced 5G modem,   referring to it as the ""world's first global 5G modem.""Image source: Qualcomm.""All I can tell you is the investment in the modem portfolio   -- and the commitment to invest in the modem portfolio -- is very   strong and we think that over time we can be in an absolute   equivalent position to our competitors,"" Shenoy asserted.The executive conceded that the company is ""coming from a   position of being behind and so it's going to take us a few   generations to catch up.""Catching up with the market leaders, particularly Qualcomm, is   going to be a tall order, but if the company can pull it off, I'm   sure that Apple -- which likes to have multiple sources for   critical components -- will be extremely happy.10 stocks we like better than QualcommWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Apple, Inc. Brings Its Fight With Qualcomm to China;January 25, 2017, 02:30:00 PM EDT;"Image source: Apple.Earlier this month,Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) filed ablockbuster lawsuitagainst its most important supplier,Qualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM) , alleging a wide range of transgressions that   were all intended to enhance Qualcomm's monopoly power over the   baseband processor market. That suit came just days after theU.S. Federal Trade Commission fileda similar regulatory antitrust complaint against the mobile chip   giant.makeArticleAd();Apple isn't stopping there; the Mac maker is now taking its   grievances to the Middle Kingdom.There's more where that came fromApple has filed not one, but two suits against Qualcomm in   Beijing,Reutersreports. The first is seeking 1 billion yuan (approximately $145   million) in damages, accusing Qualcomm of abusing its monopoly   power in the baseband market. The second alleges that Qualcomm   has not fulfilled its obligations to license its   standards-essential patents under fair, reasonable, and   non-discriminatory (FRAND) levels.The fact that Apple is suing Qualcomm in China is notable for   a few reasons, the most obvious being that the scope of Apple's   complaints reaches beyond just the U.S. itself. Apple's lawsuit   in the U.S. was filed in the U.S. District Court of Southern   California. China also doesn't have a particularly good   reputation for enforcing intellectual property (IP) laws,   although the country has been making progress on improving its   legal frameworks. The discrepancy in IP enforcement is one reason   why many Chinese smartphone manufacturers, most notably Xiaomi,   are unable to expand operations into countries with stricter   enforcement.China is also where the vast majority of Apple's contract   manufacturers are located, including its most prolific iPhone   assembler, Foxconn. These contract manufacturers are partially   responsible for Apple's predicament with Qualcomm. As noted inApple's U.S. complaint, Qualcomm refuses to license its IP directly to Apple, instead   preferring to ink deals with Apple contract manufacturers that   pass along both the IP rights indirectly as well as the royalty   costs in full. Apple's manufacturing partners simply accept   Qualcomm's terms and do not negotiate, leaving Apple with massive   royalty bills.Apple has long attempted to review the agreements between   Qualcomm and its contract manufacturers, but Qualcomm must   consent -- and it won't. I'm neither an American or Chinese   lawyer, but it seems possible that Apple is seeking legal   assistance in China so that it may gain access or somehow   restructure these agreements, although legal discovery in China   is significantly more restricted than here in the U.S. Even if   that's not the goal, it wouldn't hurt to collect more in monetary   damages by filing suit in multiple relevant jurisdictions, as   Apple says it's been overcharged by billions of dollars over the   past five years.This serves as additional evidence that Apple has absolutelyno intention of settlingwith Qualcomm. The company feels as if it has been wronged all   these years, being coerced into quietly overpaying Qualcomm for   half a decade. And now that Qualcomm's exclusivity has ended, the   time for reckoning has come.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Starbucks Corporation (SBUX) Stock Hinges on Same-Store Sales Numbers;January 25, 2017, 02:24:34 PM EDT;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIt's no secret that the retail sector and restaurant stocks are both suffering. Living in the world between the two, venerable slinger of legal stimulantsStarbucks Corporation(NASDAQ:SBUX) is caught in the crosshairs of lower consumer spending. With its focus on both beverages and gifts, its earnings report is a critical one for SBUX. Even more so, since it has now started to refrain from providing forward guidance figures.Source:Javier Gonzlez Via FlickrThe name of the game for SBUX will be same-store sales and whether or not its loyalty program is indeed paying benefits in the consumer slowdown.makeArticleAd();For investors, this Starbucks earnings report is very much one to watch.A Focus on Consumer Growth at SBUXThe so-called restaurant recession has even started to have its way with mighty Starbucks. Over the last few quarters, SBUX has seen its global traffic start to slip. Much of that slippage has come from the United States. Just askMcDonald's Corporation(NYSE:MCD) about its recent numbers coming from the U.S. The restaurant recession is real, and consumers are clamping down on the amount they are spending out to eat.SBUX was considered more immune to the effects, but it looks like the coffee purveyor could get hit by the slowdown after all.10 High-Yield Dividend Stocks That Are SOMEHOW     Still BargainsDuring thepreviously reported quarter,SBUX posted just a 1% increase in global consumer traffic for the last 12 months. During the prior quarter, Starbucks posted a 3% jump. Just in the U.S., Starbucks actually reported a 1%declinein traffic. This dwindling of traffic resulted in same-store sales growth dropping to just a 5% increase vs. a 6% in each of the previous four fiscal years.That drop can be a tad bit worrisome for SBUX stock owners. And considering that it has proved no guidance on what to expect, analysts don't exactly agree on what the jump - if any - will be.But one thing they all agree on is that its revamped loyalty program and recent tech initiatives will be its saving grace.SBUX changed the way it calculated rewards and free drinks a few quarters ago. The new system is proving to be a huge win for consumers and Starbucks itself.This ""digital ecosystem"" that links Starbucks Cards, apps, and various corporate partnerships with companies such asApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) and theNew York Times Co(NYSE:NYT) is continuing to drive sales at the firm and overcome potentially worse dips. Last quarter, payment via mobile means represented 6% of their total and saw a big increase. Traditional Starbucks card orders/payments also rose considerably.With new plug-ins for its mobile app/loyalty rewards members, the hope is that SBUX stock can turn around the recent drop in sales/foot traffic.Other efforts such as its continued focus on food should also help. SBUX is quickly turning into a lunch and mid-day destination, rather than just a place to get your morning cup of joe. However, even here, it has seen some adverse effects.Its recent stoppageof late-night beer and wine sales highlights the challenging restaurant environment.Even with the declines, it is still expected to see a rise in total revenues for the quarter.According to FactSet, Starbucks is expected to report earnings per share of 52 cents. That's up from up from 46 cents reported for the same period last year. Revenues should clock in at $5.85 billion - up from $5.37 billion last year.In the end, the focus will be 100% on the trend/pace of sales and store foot traffic. Investors will be looking to see if SBUX can stop the bleeding of foot traffic and reverse the trend.SBUX Still a Profit MachineFor SBUX, the tale isn't about profits. It has those. The focus will come down to whether or not the giant can really overcome the new operating environment that all eateries and retailers are facing. It's tough out there - the recent decline in same-store sales highlight justhowtough.Intel Corporation (INTC) Q4 Earnings     PreviewHowever, don't forget that SBUX has more arrows in its quiver than the average retailer/restaurant stock.This quarter will be all about how it uses those arrows and whether it can hit the bullseye. If it falters even a tad, investors could sell down SBUX shares.As of this writing, Aaron Levitt did not hold a position in   any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace7 Straight-A Stocks to Build Your Portfolio     AroundThe 7 Best High-Yield Investments for     RetirementThe postStarbucks Corporation (SBUX) Stock Hinges on Same-Store Sales Numbersappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Image source: Pixabay.There's more going on under the hoodSiri got its first major overhaul in mid-2014 when its voice   recognition was shifted to a neural network. This AI model,   designed to simulate the human brain, is a combination of   software and algorithms that improves over time by learning from   its experience. This was the first of many such upgrades to Siri,   all without much fanfare.Apple has been using AI to improve a number of its native   apps. The Maps app will automatically identify traffic problems   and route you around them. It will also help you find your car in   the parking lot. The Photos app will identify the people in your   photos and can group them together. The Memories app will collect   images from your phone to create an event video, memorializing a   recent outing or vacation. iMessage will automatically translate   text to emojis.Siri can interact with third-party apps to order pizza,   schedule an Uber or Lyft, or start a workout. It will integrate   with other popular apps such as WhatsApp, Skype, WeChat, and   Pinterest.Apple isn't stopping there. Siri is available on Apple Watches   and TVs, and with the macOS Sierra update, it will even work   on laptops and Macintosh computers. It will now search for   documents on your computer and narrow those searches even further   using keywords.Better selfies and a secret...Improved images using AI technology. Image source:     Apple.Apple used AI to strengthen the capabilities of the camera on   its iPhone 7. It claims this is not only the best camera in any   smartphone, but thanks to the company's software, the iPhone 7   can produce images that once required an expensive camera and   professional photographer. Using AI and algorithms, it can   distinguish between the subject of the photo and the background,   which simply wasn't possible with previous smartphone cameras due   to the size of the aperture. This latest upgrade can also   determine depth with the introduction of two lenses.There is intriguing evidence that more powerful AI may be   coming with the recent discovery ofa specialized chipwithin the iPhone. Thefield-programmable gate array processor   inside the latest iPhone can be re-purposed after installation,   and has historically been used to accelerate machine learning.   Apple has repeatedly said that it would protect user privacy, and   does so by keeping the most sensitive user data stored locally on   the device. This latest revelation would be in keeping with that   philosophy by enabling more sophisticated machine learning   capabilities directly on the phone.While other companies are uploading data to the cloud to   achieve advances in AI, Apple says it can make the same gains,   all while protecting your privacy. It's tapping the concept of   differential privacy, which seeks to identify trends without   sacrificing personal data. In this technology, electronic ""noise""   is added to information on the phone, protecting the raw data and   transmitting only the trends. This approach keeps user data at   the local phone level while allowing Apple to continue its   advances in AI.In a recent interview, Tim Cook said:Look at the (technologies) that will be dominant in     smartphones of the future -- like AI. AI will make this product     even more essential to you. It will become even a better     assistant than it is today. So where you probably aren't     leaving home without it today -- you're really going to be     connected to it in the future...we do all of that while     protecting your privacy. Instead of passing all that     information to the cloud, where we're maintaining it all, we do     a lot of it on the device itself. So you're in control of your     own data.Foolish final wordAs the use of AI becomes more prolific, justifiable concerns     regarding protecting individual information may become more     prevalent. If Apple succeeds in gathering the data it needs     while still protecting the data of its users, this may force     other companies to follow suit. Apple has always demonstrated a     concern for protecting customer data. In a recent extreme     example, it stood against the FBI in early 2016, rejecting a     request to unlock the iPhone of the terrorist behind theSan     Bernardino mass shooting , citing privacy concerns.Putting user privacy first gives Apple a continuing     competitive advantage, even as other companies garner headlines     around their AI breakthroughs.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock       tip, it can pay to listen.

Is Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Ending the Age of Intel (INTC)?;January 25, 2017, 11:18:34 AM EDT;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFor decades,Intel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) was at the heart of the technology industry. As the company whose CPUs dominated the PC era, it was second to none. But Intel missed out on the mobile revolution and with PCs losing relevance every year, its leadership position has weakened. Nudging itself into Intel's place?NvidiaCorporation(NASDAQ:NVDA).makeArticleAd();Click to EnlargeSource: NVIDIANvidia started as a PC graphics card manufacturer, but now, NVDA stock is riding a wave of virtual reality gaming, artificial intelligence, deep data analysis, cloud computing and self-driving cars.As its GPU-accelerated products take over processor-intensive computing, is Nvidia set to dethrone Intel?GPUs Make the Leap From Graphics to Raw Processing PowerIn the old days of computing, graphics processing units (GPUs) played second fiddle to central processing units (CPUs).Intel's processors were literally at the heart of almost every computer sold. The CPU was responsible for running the computer, including its operating system. When a GPU was installed, the CPU was still primary, but it farmed off graphics-intensive tasks to the GPU. Most PCs used integrated graphics that were built into their Intel CPU. Graphics cards from companies like Nvidia - with a standalone GPU - were primarily used in specialized gaming PCs.It helps to think of the CPU as a generalist, while the GPU does one thing over and over. This difference began really turning to the advantage of NVDA about a decade ago.10 Companies That Are Bringing Jobs Back to AmericaDesktop PC CPUs from Intel might have four cores, letting the CPU manage a handful of different tasks simultaneously. GPUs were equipped with hundreds of cores, and software developers realized they could take advantage of this raw parallel processing power for much more than just graphics. The GPU could be used to greatly accelerate software performance when repetitive tasks are being performed - encoding video, for example, or data analysis.GPU acceleration can make some tasks 100 times fasterthan a CPU alone.Because the GPU is designed for one primary purpose - everything including computer graphics boils down to crunching numbers - NVDA is able to produce them at far lower cost than a CPU at an equivalent performance level, while producing less heat and using less power.Why GPUs Are in Higher Demand Than CPUsWhy the demand for GPUs?Think of how the demand for processor-intensive computing power has increased over the past decade. One early example was Bitcoin. The virtual currency could be purchased, but it could also be ""mined"" by using a PC to run a complex algorithm in search of Bitcoins. Miners soon discovered that a GPU - with its parallel number-crunching capability - was far more effective than a CPU at mining Bitcoins.Anywhere from 50 to 100 times faster. Soon miners were running rigs consisting of multiple GPUs connected together.Meantime, GPUs have rapidly become more powerful, with more cores and faster clock rates, even as CPU development has become relatively incremental.Intel's new seventh-generation Kaby Lake Core i7 CPU for desktop computers still has four cores. In comparison, Nvidia's latestTitan X graphics cardhas 3,584 processing cores on tap. The Intel CPU costs less than a third of the Titan X's $1200 MSRP, but when used in number-crunching applications, the Nvidia card's price is a steal.The technology that has the big potential for future growth involvesextremenumber crunching. Think virtual reality, the hottest trend in gaming. Cloud services - which are often a single, processor-intensive task like image recognition offloaded to the web. Artificial intelligence, machine learning, data mining and deep data - these all require incredible processing power. Computers running INTC CPUs are too expensive and too general purpose to be running these tasks. Instead, you're more likely to find server farms powered by GPUs.NVDA has also integrated its powerful GPUs into the forefront of one of the technology holy grails: self-driving cars.Nvidia Drive PX2is the company's AI car computing platform. With two GPUs providing the horsepower, NVDA says it is capable of 34 trillion deep learning operations per second. Additional units can be run in parallel for fully autonomous driving. Nvidia has alreadypartnered with multiple high-profile automakersto equip their self-driving cars with its technology, includingBMW,VolvoandTesla Motors Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA)Growing Importance of the GPU Reflected in NVDA StockYou can track the relative trajectories in INTC and NVDA by comparing their stock prices. Over the past five years, Intel has grown in value by a little more than 40%. That's not bad, but doesn't look quite so good when you compare it to the height of PC popularity. Since 2000, when PC sales were notching14.5% annual sales growth, Intel stock has actually dropped by 10%.3 Internet of Things (IoT) Stocks to Buy Now (NVDA, ISIL, STM)In comparison, Nvidia stock is up by a whopping 650% in the past five years, and nearly 2,600% since 2000.Intel Isn't Going Anywhere, But the Age of NVIDIA Has ArrivedComputer sales continue their slow slide,down another 5.7% in 2016. Much of Intel's revenue is tied to the PC market. Nvidia is not immune to the effect of declining PC sales, either.But while INTC is trying to tie its future to technology like the Internet of Things (which is struggling with security issues and competing standards), NVDA has leveraged the massive parallel processing power of its GPUs to be a leader in multiple cutting-edge areas like AI, deep data, virtual reality and autonomous vehicles.Increasingly, it's looking like we're entering the age of Nvidia. NVDA stock reflects that reality.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 Stocks to Buy to Survive a ""Trumpsy-Turvy"" 20173 Things Apple Inc.

Apple 'Hopeful' About Future iPhone Manufacturing in India;January 25, 2017, 11:01:00 AM EDT;"On Wednesday,AppleAAPLexecutives met with government officials of India to discuss plans about manufacturing iPhones in the country.Like many tech corporations-think AmazonAMZNand NetflixNFLX-Apple is eager to begin assembling its iPhone in India, which has become one of the world's fastest growing smartphone markets in recent years. Apple currently only has a tiny market share in the country, and is ready to start bolstering its stagnate global sales. The company even applied to open retail stores in India last year.""We've been working hard to develop our operations in India,"" Apple said in a brief statement. ""We appreciate the constructive and open dialogue we've had with government about further expanding our local operations.""The tech giant's plans to set up an iPhone production plant was initially reported on byTimes of India. The newspaper reported that the factory would be built in partnership with Taiwan-based manufacturer Wistron.According toCNNMoney, India has over 300 million smartphone users, or 18% more than last year. Apple, then, has much to gain if it can build a successful iPhone production plant in the country. However, Apple's products are not cheap, and most of India's 1.3 billion people have an average annual income of $1,500.Zacks' Top 10 Stocks for 2017In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest tickers for the entirety of 2017?Who wouldn't?

And thatbodes wellfor MSFT stock.The Nadella EffectNew CEO Satya Nadella deserves much of the credit for the turnaround in Microsoft and MSFT stock. Since Nadella was was appointed as CEO on Feb. 4, 2014, Microsoft shares have skyrocketed as much as 75%, when factoring its 52-week high of $64.10 reached on Dec. 23.That comes out to 25% annual returns. And for a number of catalysts currently in play, MSFT stock is poised to reach $75 in the next 12 to 18 months, delivering some 25% returns.Not only has the market rewarded Nadella for moving Microsoft toward high-growth areas such as the cloud with Office 365 and the company's dominant Azure platform, Nadella has - in the process - made investors forget Microsoft's failures under former CEO Steve Ballmer. Notably, missing out on mobile and being surpassed by the likes ofApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) andSamsung Electronics(OTCMKTS:SSNLF).10 High-Yield Dividend Stocks That Are SOMEHOW Still BargainsBut thanks to Nadella's strong pulse on the company, Microsoft won't miss out on anymore opportunities.The M&A EffectTake, for example, last week'sacquisition of Simplygon, a company that develops 3D-optimization solutions for video game developers and other industries that need to visualize 3D data. Microsoft didn't reveal how much it paid for Simplygon, not that its price is important. What matters is the extent to which this deal can help Microsoft leverage its existing ""3D to everyone"" initiative, which makes it easy to capture, create and share in 3D images.The deal for Simplygon follows last Friday's deal for artificial intelligence (AI) startupMaluuba, which specializes in deep learning and reinforcement learning. And to say nothing about its $26.2 billion blockbuster deal for LinkedIn Corp, which closed in December.With almost $140 billion in cash on its balance sheet, there's not much Microsoft can't afford. And Satya seems determined to deploy the company's cash to ensure Microsoft's growth never peaks.Bottom Line on MSFT StockMicrosoft stock - currently priced at a forward price-earnings ratio of just 19 - deserves a higher multiple. With growth opportunities emerging in the realm of Internet of Things, smart homes, the cloud and now 3D and AI, MSFT stock - despite trading near all-time highs - still looks attractive.The LinkedIn deal, which exposes Microsoft to a new set of growth areas such as advertising, putting it in the realm ofFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB), deserves an additional three to four points above Microsoft's current P/E.Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Q4 Earnings PreviewLooking out to the next 12 to 18 months, MSFT stock is poised to reach $75, when assigning a P/E of 23 (compared to Facebook's 24) to fiscal 2017 estimates of the $3.27 per share.Aside from delivering 10% earnings growth in 2017, MSFT stock pays a 2.5% dividend yield, making it one of the better bargains in tech.As of this writing, Richard Saintvilus did not hold any a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceCan the Shark Tank Make These 3 Canadian Stocks Great Again?The 3 Best Under-the-Radar Trump Stocks to BuyThe postHere's Why Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock Will Hit $75appeared first onInvestorPlace."
Why Apple Inc. Stock (AAPL) Was Downgraded Ahead Of Earnings;January 25, 2017, 10:45:01 AM EDT;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsApple Inc.(AAPL) stock was little changed in early trading on Tuesday before rallying in Wednesday morning trading following a rare downgrade from analysts atBarclays.makeArticleAd();The iPhone maker is scheduled to release its next earnings report on Jan. 31, and the story on Wall Street is weak iPhone 7 sales.Still, some are finding cause to remain positive as consumers seem to be favoring the more expensive iPhone 7 Plus, which of course is a good thing for the average selling price. Barclays' downgrade follows aprice target increaselast week.Apple Stock DowngradedIn a research note Tuesday morning, Barclays analyst Mark Moskowitz went so far as to say that he doesn't see any big catalysts for Apple stock for the next 12 months. This implies that he's not even sure that the iPhone 8 will move the needle on sales enough to boost investor confidence, at least in the early days. Twelve months will bring us past the launch of this year's iPhone models.The analyst downgraded Apple stock from ""Overweight""to ""Equal-weight""and trimmed his price target by $2 to $117 per share.Part of Moskowitz's newfound bearishness on Apple stock is less company-specific and more about the decelerating smartphone sales being felt across the industry.10 Stocks to Buy for Donald Trump's Second WindLooking out to the long term, however, he feels that the stickiness of the iPhone maker's ecosystem, big cash stash and tenth anniversary iPhone (widely expected to bethe iPhone 8) will serve as a support for investors.Here's how two additional analysts view the future prospects for AAPL stockBuy AAPL On a PullbackPacific Crestanalyst Andy Hargreaves said on Monday that investors should think about buying Apple stock on a ""meaningful pullback."" Although he thinks December quarter sales might be in line with consensus, he warned that March quarter sales could decline on the back of the iPhone's weakest sell-through data ever.However, he maintained his ""Overweight""rating and $127 price target on Apple stock.UBSanalyst Steven Milunovich also has $127 price target paired with a Buy rating on Apple stock, and he said in a note dated Jan. 24 that the CIRP survey suggests a mix shift toward the iPhone 7 Plus and models with more storage in the U.S., both of which are good for the average selling price.The survey indicated that 42% of iPhone sales were the Plus models, a much greater percentage than last year's 26%. Sixty-two percent of buyers favored the $100 or $200 step-ups in storage, and Android switchers remained stable even as the upgrade rate was strong.Milunovich is concerned about China and currency headwinds even though he still looks for iPhone growth in the double digits for fiscal 2018. He expects continued declines in China.Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Q4 Earnings PreviewFurther, the higher bill of materials for the iPhone 7 lineup could offset the mix shift toward more expensive models, pressuring the gross margin.The UBS analyst is roughly in line with consensus on Apple'sDecember quarter earnings. He's looking for $77.8 billion in sales, compared to the consensus of $77.4 billion and toward the high end of the company's outlook of $76 billion to 78 billion.He pegs the iPhone maker's earnings per share at $3.24 and its iPhone units at 76 million, compared to the Street's estimate of 78 million.

Alternative Facts? Apple, Inc. Gets a Strange Downgrade;January 25, 2017, 10:40:00 AM EDT;"Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) shares sat out of the stock market rally on   Tuesday, largely because of a downgrade fromBarclays. Analyst Mark Moskowitz expects the smartphone market to   stagnate this year. Moreover, unlike many other analysts, he   doesn't see the upcoming 10th anniversary iPhone as a major   growth catalyst.Indeed, Moskowitz asserts that iPhone buyers are increasingly   opting to buy older models like the iPhone 6s in order to save   $100, rather than paying up for Apple's latest and greatest   designs. If consumers are becoming more focused on price than   design, they might not care that much about the major design   changes expected in the next-generation iPhone.makeArticleAd();Are consumers still willing to pay up for the priciest iPhones   or are they trading down? Image source: Apple.However, there is very little evidence that iPhone buyers are   actually trading down. As a result, investors shouldn't pay much   attention to Moskowitz's bearish prognostications.Customers haven't been trading downiPhone users weren't trading down in a meaningful way during   the first half of fiscal 2016. In Q1 -- the all-important holiday   quarter -- Apple's average selling price (ASP) for the iPhone   rose slightly year over year, despite a 6% to 7% headwind from   the strengthening dollar. The increase in ASPs was boosted by a   growing preference for pricier iPhones with larger screens and   more storage. Still, the data aren't consistent with a big shift   toward buying older models.During Q2, the iPhone ASP slipped about 2.5% year over year,   but it still likely rose on a currency-neutral basis.   Furthermore, Apple faced a tough comparison that quarter because   it had been catching up from an iPhone 6 Plus supply shortage a   year earlier.The iPhone 6s sold quite well considering that it was only a     minor upgrade of the iPhone 6. Image source: Apple.The iPhone ASP did fall 10% and 8% on a year-over-year basis   in the third and fourth quarters, respectively. That provides   some evidence of customers trading down. However, much of the   decline was again caused by the strong dollar. Furthermore, the   budget-priced iPhone SE launched early in Q3 last year. Thus, for   most of the second half of fiscal 2016, Apple's newest iPhone was   also its cheapest iPhone. This obviously weighed on ASPs.iPhone unit sales did decline last year, perhaps due to   perceptions that the iPhone 6s wasn't a big upgrade over the   iPhone 6. Nevertheless, considering all of the evidence, it   appears that those consumers who did buy an iPhone during Apple's   fiscal 2016 continued to favor the newest models.Apple's iPhone mix probably improved last quarterWe won't know for sure whether the iPhone ASP increased or   decreased last quarter until Apple reports its Q1 earnings next   week. However, the preliminary evidence derived from iPhone usage   data points toward a solid increase.First, the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus currently account for   about 14.5% of total iPhone usage,according to Fiksu. That's exactly in line with the usage share of the iPhone 6s   and iPhone 6s Plus a year ago. Given that the iPhone user base is   probably still expanding at a double-digit annual rate, an equal   usage share implies higher unit sales.Mixpanel, another company that tracks iPhone usage -- but with   more U.S.-centric data -- shows an even bigger sales uptick for   the latest iPhones compared to last year's models.Second, the popularity of the pricier ""Plus"" models continues   to grow, even after Apple hiked its prices for the iPhone 7 Plus   lineup by $20. (Demand was so strong that the iPhone 7 Plus was   inshort supplyfor most of last quarter.) The iPhone 7 Plus had a usage share of   4.4% at the end of Q1, compared to 3.4% for the iPhone 6s Plus a   year earlier.Demand for the iPhone 7 Plus has been red-hot. Image source:   Apple.Partially offsetting this, the dollar has continued to rise   against some key foreign currencies (mainly the British pound and   Chinese yuan). But that just means that even a small ASP increase   would indicate significant year-over-year improvement in the   iPhone product mix.Are expectations too low?Since bottoming out around $90 in May, Apple's stock price has   shot up by 34%. This suggests that investors are starting to   become more optimistic about the company's prospects.Nevertheless, many Wall Street analysts still have very low   expectations. In fact, analysts expect Apple to report a   year-over-year EPS decline next week, despite the positive iPhone   usage data and strong growth in Apple's services business.If Apple is able to beat the estimates by reporting modest   earnings growth for Q1 and offering a solid outlook for Q2,   shares of the tech giant could begin 2017 with another rally.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Will Q4 Earnings Strengthen Tech ETFs Further?;January 25, 2017, 09:52:00 AM EDT;"After earnings releases from most of the major financial companies, the tech sector is now taking center stage. Most of the ace tech players are lined up to report this and next week. Investors should note that a rising rate environment, improving industry fundamentals, ongoing consolidations, and emerging technologies such as cloud computing, Internet of Things (IoT) and autonomous cars are benefiting the sector, pushing the stocks and ETFs to record highs this year.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');In fact, four popular ETFs -Select Sector SPDR Technology ETFXLK,Vanguard Information Technology ETFVGT,iShares Dow Jones US Technology ETFIYWandMSCI Information Technology Index ETFFTEC- are up more than 3% each so far this year. These funds have the largest allocation to the four tech giants - AppleAAPL, MicrosoftMSFT, AlphabetGOOGLand FacebookFB. IYW has the largest concentration in these firms with a combined share of 42.4%, followed by 38.7% for VGT, 36.1% for XLK and 34% for FTEC (read:5 ETF Investment Ideas for 2017).Let's dig deeper into the earnings picture of these companies that would drive the performance of the above-mentioned funds in the coming days:Inside Our Surprise PredictionApple is slated to release earnings after market close on January 31. The stock has seen positive earnings estimate revision of eight cents over the past 90 days for the to-be-reported quarter. It has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and anEarnings ESPof -0.31%, indicating lower chances of beating estimates this quarter. However, the iPhone maker delivered positive earnings surprises in three of the last four quarters, with an average beat of 0.11%. The stock has an unimpressive VGM Style Score of D.Microsoft has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and an Earnings ESP of +1.28%, indicating higher chances of beating estimates this quarter. It delivered positive earnings surprises in three of the last four quarters, with an average beat of 10.55%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter 2016 increased by a penny to 78 cents over the past three months. The stock has a top VGM Style Score of A. The company is expected to report after the closing bell on January 26 (read:Top-Ranked Sector ETFs & Stocks to Buy for 2017).Alphabet has a Zacks Rank #2 and an Earnings ESP of -0.26%, indicating lower chances of beating estimates this quarter. Though the earnings surprise track over the past four quarters is good with an average beat of 4.55%, Alphabet witnessed a negative earnings estimate revision of eight cents over the past 90 days for the to-be-reported quarter. The stock has a top VGM Style Score of A. The company will report after the closing bell on January 26.Facebook is expected to release its earnings report on February 1 after market close. It has a Zacks Rank #3 with an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, which makes surprise prediction difficult. Facebook delivered positive earnings surprises the last four quarters, with an average beat of 21.11% and saw positive earnings estimates revision of nine cents over the past three months for the to-be-reported quarter. The stock has a solid VGM Style Score of B.Summing UpOverall, the tech sector is expected to post earnings growth of 3.6% in the fourth quarter compared with 5.2% growth in the third. Additionally, it has a solidrankin the top 31%, suggesting some outperformance in the weeks ahead (see:all the Technology ETFs here).Given the favorable Zacks Rank and positive earnings outlook, surprises might be in the cards. This could give a further boost to the strength in the tech ETFs.

Apple Earnings Strategy: When To Buy AAPL Shares;January 25, 2017, 09:42:45 AM EDT;"Apple will release earnings soon (Shutterstock photo)Apple (AAPL) will release their earnings for the fourth quarter of 2017 next Tuesday, and the guessing game has begun. It used to be that analysts would wait until they had seen the numbers before opining or changing any rating on Apple stock. In part that was because up until last year, the company continually made those analysts look foolish by beating every quarters estimates by huge margins.That meant that investors who bought the stock in the run up to earnings invariably benefited, and analysts would rush to upgrade forecasts once the extent of the beat was known. However, the recent slowdown in growth has changed the dynamic somewhat.makeArticleAd();Now it seems that the competition among those that cover AAPL is to see who can come out with the gloomiest earnings prediction, and who can downgrade the earliest. Over the past week two big names, Barclays and Stifel have downgraded AAPL in front of earnings, both citing worries about i-Phone 7 sales.This kind of focus on potential and actual negatives surrounding Apples earnings has changed the way retail investors should approach the release too. With such negativity abounding the stock is likely to lose ground as earnings approach, and/or to react to anything but a spectacular report in a negative, or at best muted, manner.Far from buying in front of the release, then, waiting until afterwards makes sense this time around. That assumes that buying AAPL at all would be a good idea; an assumption not everybody will be comfortable with. The negative slant to coverage that makes it likely that you will be able to pick up AAPL cheap next week will also put off some people, but a look at the facts and prospects should reassure you.First, lets look at the stocks actual performance. If you listen to the naysayers they would have you believe that AAPL has underperformed recently. The reality, though, as demonstrated by the chart below comparing AAPL to the Nasdaq tracking ETF,QQQover the last six months, is completely different. During that time AAPL has outperformed its benchmark by a factor of 3, gaining 24% compared to the indexs 8%.Appreciation in AAPL though, as with any stock, is about what will happen in the future rather than what has happened in the past, but there are a few reasons to be optimistic on that front too. As I wrotea few weeks ago, my personal experience suggests that demand for the Apple Watch series 2 is greater than anybody expected, with a fair amount of pent up demand resulting from widespread shortages of the product in the holiday buying season.In addition, even those anticipating lower than expected iPhone sales have noted that the higher priced 7 Plus has proven more popular than expected, which should benefit the bottom line.All of that is positive, but what investors are really looking for is for Apple to do something spectacular again in order to re-invigorate the whole ecosystem. Their recent decision to start commissioning original content for Apple TV offers the possibility of that. Content production is, of course, a very crowded field right now, and a difficult business at the best of times, but Apple has a huge advantage over others that might try to break into the market: over $200 billion in cash.As Netflix (NFLX) and Amazon (AMZN) have shown, it only takes one or two hits to be successful in this area and with the ability to absorb a few failures, betting against Apple succeeding would seem to be foolish.Add in a decent and growing dividend and buying or adding to holdings of AAPL is a good idea. With that said, though, the fact that the conventional wisdom seems to be that this will be a disappointing earnings release for the company makes patience in this case a virtue, and waiting until after next Tuesdays report is a risk that should pay off."
If I Could Buy Only 1 Stock, This Would Be It;January 25, 2017, 09:40:00 AM EDT;"Image source: Apple.makeArticleAd();If I could only buy one stock right now, then there are a few   boxes that stock needs to check. I'd like the holding to be   relatively safe in a tumultuous time but still look likely to   generate modest short-term growth, while having the potential for   exceptional long-term growth. I also want the stock to have a   robust balance sheet and be relatively cheap in this expensive   market -- and is a little dividend too much to ask?For all of that, look no further thanApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) .Short-term growth prospects look goodApple's finances are massive in almost every way, with sales   in the fiscal Q4 ended Sept. 24 of $47 billion. Sales and   earnings actually slowed during the during quarter, down 9% and   19%, respectively, but the company has guided for a return to   sales growth in fiscal Q1.Some Apple bears have pointed to the company's reliance on its   iPhone -- which made up about two-thirds of sales in the most   recent quarter -- and that those sales are starting to slow as   the phone seems to be saturating the addressable market. The   average selling price (ASP) of the iPhone segment has fallen   slightly year over year.However, the iPhone could have plenty of growth left. The new   iPhone 7 launched in late 2016 seems to be performing very well   already and should help to boost ASP once again. Additionally,   the issues with the explodingSamsungGalaxy Note 7, which has even been banned on all U.S.   aircraft, could help to make 2017 iPhone sales the highest   yet.Image source: Apple.The bears also point to nascent growth in most of Apple's   other products, such as its personal computers, iPads, and the   Apple Watch. One other area that's growing impressively is the   services segment, which includes revenue from services such as   iTunes, iCloud, and Apple Pay. This segment's revenue grew 24%   year over year to $6.3 billion in the fiscal year, making up 13%   of total revenue as Apple's second largest segment by sales   behind the iPhone segment. Services are increasingly important,   as the total number of Apple products in use continues to grow   each quarter, meaning more devices that are likely linked to an   Apple account and could help services revenue to continue growing   nicely.Apple's robust financial positionWhile Apple's sales and earnings have come under pressure, its   cash growth has not. Apple's operating cash flow in the most   recent quarter surged to $16 billion, a new company record for   that time period. With so much excess cash flow, the company   has grown its total cash and investments to $238 billion, more   than a third of its market cap, and aboutdouble the next wealthiest company in the United   States.Unfortunately for Apple's capital expenditure advocates, about   90% of that money is stored out of the U.S., as the company has   resisted paying heavy repatriation taxes to bring it back home.   However, President Trump has signaled that he'd like to offer a   much lower tax rate, maybe as low as 10%, for companies in   Apple's position that are seeking to send huge chunks of money   home. There are certainly other risks for Apple in some of   Trump's proposed tax ideas, such as potential import tariffs on   goods manufactured overseas, but this one point is important for   what it could mean for Apple's cash available for immediate   use.Long-term growth potentialApple's new wireless headphones, called ""air pods."" Image     source: Apple.Apple's modest short-term growth on continued incremental   innovations and execution is encouraging, but it's much more fun   to consider Apple's moonshot long-term growth possibilities.   Apple increased its research and development spend by about 25%   to $10 billion in fiscal 2016.Speaking of the company's huge cash position, there are a few   fun reckless predictions we can make about what the company might   spend that money on developing. Self-driving cars, virtual   and augmented reality, and more recently original content for   iTunes are all areas of growth that tech industry analysts are   looking for from Apple.My favorite reckless prediction is that Apple will begin   competing more heavily in artificial intelligence. Apple's Siri   was one of the first voice-based search tools beforeAmazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) andGoogle(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) entered the space with their smart   home voice-activated devices.Amazon and Google beat Apple to market with their home   assistant devices, but Apple isn't known for being an early   market mover -- rather, Apple has a knack for swooping in with   amazing products that in turn dominate the market that's already   there. Let's not forget that Amazon and Google have ventured into   Apple's world with their consumer electronics much more than   Apple would be venturing into theirs with its own artificial   intelligence assistant.WhyApple stockstill looks like a great buyFinally, in terms of valuation, Apple still looks cheap. Even   though the stock is up 20% over the past six months, it's still   trading at just 14 times earnings. Compare that with around 25   times earnings on average for the S&P 500, Google at 30, and   Amazon at 185. Also, Apple stock has run up quickly lately, but   it's still down from its high of around $135 in mid-2015, so its   recent run doesn't look unreasonable.Add to that a relatively cheap valuation, as well as all of   the points covered here, that Apple stock also pays a 2% dividend   yield, which could very well rise as Apple deploys more of its   huge cash load in 2017. The best investment strategy is one   that's well diversified, but for all of those points -- if I   could only buy one stock, Apple continues to look like a great   stock to buy and hold as a core long-term position.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

3 Stocks to Watch on Wednesday: Alcoa Corp (AA), Cree, Inc. (CREE) and Seagate Technology PLC (STX);January 25, 2017, 09:33:18 AM EDT;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading     TipsU.S. stocks surged ahead on Tuesday led by big gains in   materials, which were up 2.5% as a group. As far as the major   indices went, theS&P 500 Indexfinished 0.7% higher, theDow Jones Industrial Averagegained 0.6% and theNasdaq Compositeimproved by 0.9%.Earnings season is speeding up in a hurry, with a number of   companies reporting their latest financial results. Among some of   the movers this morning areAlcoa Corp(NYSE:AA),Cree, Inc.(NASDAQ:CREE),Seagate Technology PLC(NASDAQ:STX)makeArticleAd();Here's what investors need to know heading into   today:Alcoa Corp (AA)AA shares were on the rise Wednesday morning despite an   earnings miss for its first report as a split company.Alcoa lost $125 million in the first quarter, or 68 cents per   share. On an adjusted basis, a profit of 14 cents per share was   well off expectations for 22 cents. That backed out items related   to properties in Suriname and western Australia.However, revenues of $2.54 billion were enough to beat   estimates for $2.54 billion. That was driven largely by higher   rolled products volume and aluminum pricing.In November, Alcoa spun off its smelting and refining   divisions as a new company, which kept the Alcoa name. The   rest of the business - specifically aerospace and automotive   products - was renamedArconic Inc(NYSE:ARNC).10 High-Yield Dividend Stocks That Are       SOMEHOW Still BargainsAA shares were up more than 2% before Wednesday's bell.Cree, Inc. (CREE)CREE shares also are up following its fiscal second-quarter   report.The light emitting diode (LED) product specialisttopped expectationson both the top and bottom lines.Profits of $6 million, or 6 cents per share, were less than   half the year-ago period's earnings.

What's more, theDow Jones Industrial Averagecould be poised to challenge the 20,000 level today, especially   if earnings from blue-chip membersUnited Technologies Corporation(NYSE:UTX) andBoeing Co(NYSE:BA) come in strong this morning.Against this backdrop, futures on theDow Jones Industrial Averagehave added 0.33%, withS&P 500futures up 0.32% andNasdaq-100futures rallying 0.43%.makeArticleAd();On the options front, Tuesday's volume came back strong from   Monday's lackluster performance. Overall, the roughly 17.5   million calls and 14.8 million puts traded put a bullish spin on   the day's activity. Bullish activity wasn't quite as pronounced   on the CBOE, however, as the single-session equity put/call   volume ratio dipped slightly to 0.65. The 10-day moving average   banked its fifth session in a row at 0.65.Turning to Tuesday's volume leaders,Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) remained pinned to the $120 region after Barclays downgraded   the shares on excessive hype surrounding the iPhone 8   ""supercycle."" Meanwhile,Facebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) continues to see call volume come in light heading into next   week's earnings report, andFreeport-McMoRan Inc(NYSE:FCX) and other miners attracted a sizable bullish bid after   President Trump signed several executive orders to help increase   infrastructure spending.Apple Inc. (AAPL)In a note to clients on Tuesday,Barclays saidthat it does not see any ""meaningful upside potential"" for AAPL   stock. The brokerage firm also downgraded Apple to ""overweight""   from ""equal weight"" and cut its price target to $117 from   $119.10 High-Yield Dividend Stocks That Are       SOMEHOW Still BargainsBarclays noted that the so-called ""supercycle"" - where iPhone   6 and 7 users upgrade to the supposedly much improved iPhone 8 -   has been overplayed and will not deliver the results many   investors are hoping for as customers increasingly mix down to   the iPhone 6S and 7S models.AAPL options activity took a noticeable hit on Tuesday   following the downgrade. Call option volume had been trending in   the 66th to 67th percentile of daily total volume, but managed to   only garner 60% of the more than 498,000 contracts traded   yesterday.Still, this one blip hasn't been enough to shake overall   sentiment on AAPL, with the 3 Feb put/call open interest ratio   falling over the past couple of weeks to rest at 0.76. The   current upside earnings target in the 3 Feb series remains $120   with 19,000 contracts, though the $125 has amassed more than   10,000 contracts, and OI is rising.Facebook Inc (FB)FB stock is also garnering quite the earnings bid from   speculative options traders. Facebook stock saw option volume   jump to 484,000 contracts on Tuesday, with calls making up a   below-average 58% of the day's take. Surprisingly, puts are in   considerable demand for FB stock ahead of earnings, with the 3   Feb put/call OI ratio rising in recent weeks to 0.93 - placing   puts and calls in near parity.On the upside, FB stock options traders are eyeballing the   $130 strike (6,500 contracts), though peak call OI for the series   totals nearly 10,000 contracts at the in-the-money $123 strike.   Implieds are pricing in a post-earnings move of about 5% for FB   stock.By the numbers, Wall Street is expecting a profit of $1.30 per   share on revenue of $8.4 billion, thoughEarningsWhispers.complaces the whisper number at $1.37 per share, hinting at elevated   expectations that may be giving options traders pause.Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (FCX)FCX stock and a bevy of other mining concerns took off on   Tuesday afterPresident Donald Trump signed several executive   ordersdesigned to increase spending on infrastructure, including orders   to streamline the permitting process and regulatory burden for   domestic manufacturers. Mining stocks have been a hot topic for   investors recently, and with Trump showing that he intends to   follow through on his infrastructure promises, investors appear   to finally be diving in.Monsanto Company (MON) Stock Should Break Out       Even HigherAs for FCX, the stock saw heavy call volume on Tuesday, with   these typically bullish bets snapping up 66% of the more than   463,000 contracts traded yesterday. Options traders were already   heavily bullish on FCX, with the stock's Feb put/call OI ratio   arriving at 0.48, indicating that calls more than double puts   among options set to expire within the next month.That said, FCX stock is selling off premarket this morning -   down nearly 3% at last check - after the company missed   fourth-quarter earnings expectations, posting a profit of 25   cents per share on revenue of $4.37 billion, versus the consensus   of 32 cents per share on revenue of $4.44 billion.As of this writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a position     in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 Stocks to Buy to Survive a ""Trumpsy-Turvy""       20177 Straight-A Stocks to Build Your Portfolio       AroundThe postWednesday's Vital Data: Apple Inc.

Apple Inc. (AAPL) iPhone Takes a Hit From  Netflix, Inc.? (NFLX);January 25, 2017, 08:39:17 AM EDT;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhenApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) designed the iPhone and iOS mobile operating system, the company chose to exclude support for external storage. On the other hand, many smartphones runningAlphabet Inc's(NASDAQ:GOOGL) Android operating system included the ability to supplement onboard storage using inexpensive SD memory cards. Not a game-changer, clearly.Source: TwitterButNetflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX) just made the difference a little more important, by adding support for Netflix downloads to SD cards on Android.makeArticleAd();To SD or Not to SDFrom the start, AAPL spurned the idea of giving iPhone (or iPad) users access to external storage. The company designed iOS to hide file directories from the user level - keeping the user interface extremely simple - and that meant not being able to choose whether to save a file in built-in storage, or in external storage.Besides keeping the user interface clean and easier to support, the move also was a financial windfall for Apple. Without any option to boost storage, users who wanted more than the bare minimum would be forced to pay for the next tier in iPhones. So that $649 base model became $749.AAPL's profit margin on that extra $100 was considerable, since the flash memory used for storage is inexpensive.For point of comparison, going from 32GB to 128GB on the iPhone 7 is an extra $100, while a 128GB microSD card can be had for $50. And that's paying retail prices, which AAPL most certainly does not.Google, on the other hand, supported the use of SD cards for external storage. It was limited at first, but by Android Marshmallow, Android users could use that extra storage for virtually anything, including apps. They could buy cheap, lower-capacity micro SD cards and swap them out at will.10 Companies That Are Bringing Jobs Back to     AmericaThis was a very popular feature, asSamsung Electronics Co Ltd(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) discovered when it ditched the feature on the Galaxy S6. After the outcry, the capabilityreturned with the Galaxy S7.Netflix Downloads Makes SD Card Support a Bigger DealThe announcement of Netflix downloads for iOS and Android was a very popular move. Watching video on a smartphone is popular, but cellular data isn't cheap. The new feature meant you could watch Netflix on iPhone or Android devices while commuting, traveling of just hanging around - without worrying about a big data bill.Yesterday, Netflix downloads gainedSD card support on Android. Suddenly, those cheap storage cards - that the iPhone cannot use - became a bigger deal. One hour of HD video downloaded to a mobile device from Netflixuses about 440MB of storage space.With movies approaching 1GB each, you can see how this could add up quickly.For travelers using Netflix on iPhone, the downloads could turn into an exercise in strategic file management. For someone with a Galaxy S7, a $50 card they can pop in their phone would hold 100 movies or more.Netflix just may have become the killer app that makes SD cards on smartphones a serious advantage.Just Another Challenge for the iPhone 8When Apple releases the iPhone 8 in the fall, it's going to be going up against intense competition. Google is expected to release the second generation of itspopularPixel Phone. More importantly, Samsung appears to be throwing everything it has at the Galaxy S8. The company hasput the Galaxy Note 7 debacle behind itand is reassuring consumers the Galaxy S8 battery is practically bulletproof.Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Steals AI Expert Back From     Apple Inc. (AAPL)In addition, theGalaxy S8 is rumoredto have a curved, bezel-free display, a larger screen (in the same size form factor), iris scanner and an optional dock that turns it into an Android-running desktop PC.Netflix downloads supporting SD cards on Android smartphones won't derail the iPhone 8. However, now that support for SD cards has a killer app, it's one more feature - or lack thereof - the competition can hammer on when AAPL releases its all-important 10th anniversary iPhone.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in   any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceApple Inc.

The Tech Battle for the Classroom Is Heating Up;January 24, 2017, 09:39:00 PM EDT;"Image source: Getty Images.Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) has been making steady gains in   the classroom, thanks to the Chromebook. The search giant is   looking to maintain that momentum and has just announced two new   Chromebooks that are specifically designed for the educational   market. Google is also taking the opportunity to share a few data   points. There are now 20 million teachers and students using   Chromebooks and Google Classroom, and over 70 million people now   use G Suite for Education, the company's online productivity   suite that's tailored for educational purposes.makeArticleAd();A tale of two new educational ChromebooksThe two new devices are the Acer Chromebook Spin 11 and the   ASUS Chromebook C213. Google says it collaborated with educators   to include features that would specifically help in the   classroom. Specifically, that includes stylus support for   students to draw and take notes. In order to keep costs down, the   styluses are cheap, don't need to be charged or paired, and are   easily replaced if lost. This move is clearly designed to broaden   appeal by offering something that tablets do.In May 2016, Google said it was bringing Android apps to   Chrome OS. This was part of Google's broader strategy to merge   Chrome OS and Android. Administrators will be able to install   Android apps on educational Chromebooks, which is a big win   considering how much more educational content is available for   Android.Microsoft wants inChromebooks and tablets have largely displaced low-costMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) PCs, but the software giant is fighting back.   Microsoft also just announced Intune for Education. Intune is the   company's mobile device management offering, which has   historically been catered to the enterprise. Intune for Education   will be a cloud-based application for device management, which   will allow administrators to manage a group of Windows 10 devices   in educational settings. Microsoft says this is one of two   critical pieces that it has been missing in the educational   market, with the other being affordable Windows 10 PCs.Video source: Microsoft.Microsoft makes it clear that it's taking a direct shot at   Chromebooks, saying, ""New Windows 10 Devices Offer Great   Alternatives to Chromebooks."" The company is unveiling a slew of   new Windows 10 devices that are targeting education, fromHP, Acer, and Lenovo.Where's Apple?A few years back,Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) tried to position the iPad as the ideal   educational computing device, but for the most part those   aspirations have fallen flat. Chromebooks are able to undercut   iPads by a significant margin, and the presence of an attached   keyboard is important for education and productivity. Many of the   Chromebooks and Windows PCs that are gaining traction in the   educational market are priced at just $150 to $300; the cheapest   iPad is the aging iPad Mini 2 that was launched in 2013 and   currently costs $269.The educational market has long been important to Apple from a   philosophical perspective, if not a financial one. But prices   continue to fall, hindering Apple's ability to compete.   Importantly, 2-in-1 devices are expected to continue growing in   education, and Apple does not offer a full-fledged 2-in-1   product.It looks like Microsoft and Google may end up winning the   battle for the classroom.10 stocks we like better than MicrosoftWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

The Problem With Apple's TV Ambitions;January 24, 2017, 07:49:00 PM EDT;"Image Source: Motley Fool.Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) has toyed with the idea of entering the television   industry for what seems like ages now. Since it unveiled the   original Apple TV in 2007, the company has considered   manufacturing its own television set, putting together a ""skinny   bundle,"" and even, according to pundits, making an offer for a   company likeNetflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) .makeArticleAd();Apple has long had a foothold in music ever since it launched   iTunes, and television could bring the same complementary   benefits to its ecosystem. Apple already sells many of the   devices used to consume streaming video, and technology has   tipped the entertainment scales toward tech companies rather than   traditional media players. After Netflix, e-commerce giantAmazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) has made the biggest splash in streaming.Now Apple wants to join the herd, producing its own original   shows. According toTheWall Street Journal, the company has been in talks with producers to make its own   programming, which would be available to subscribers of its   $10/month music-streaming service. The company hopes to launch   such programming by the end of 2017.However, while it seems natural for Apple to have ambitions in   TV, diving straight into original programming could present a   number of challenges for the company.1. Profits are thinAfter years of breakneck international expansion, Netflix is   finally set to deliver its first year of ""material profits"" since   2011, when it split its streaming service from its DVD-by-mail   business after years of operating at breakeven. Amazon,   meanwhile, doesn't break out figures for its streaming service,   and essentially gives it away to its Prime members, using its   content as a carrot to entice more people to shop on its   website.The point is that video streaming is no one's idea of a cash   cow at this point. The services are so cheap, at about $10/month,   that a company needs to generate a substantial base before hoping   to make a profit. Netflix, for example, is set to top 100 million   subscribers this year, but it took the company years to get to   that point. Apple could operate the service at a loss, but that   seems contrary to the company's high-margin business model. With   more than $45 billion in net income in its last fiscal year, it's   going to take more than a small video streaming service to move   the needle.2. Where's the expertise?Apple is a device-maker. Its brand and its profits come from   making hardware like the iPhone, iPad, and the Mac. Developing   and shopping for TV shows is outside of its core competencies,   and because iTunes has languished over the years, it lacks the   detailed data that competitors like Netflix have on customer   preferences.Analysts dismissed Netflix's initial ambitions in original   programming, but the company's vast database guided it when it   chose to remake the British seriesHouse of Cards, as it recognized that its subscribers had a penchant for   political dramas and actor Kevin Spacey. That show would be the   first of several hit series for Netflix.Amazon may have had to start more from scratch, though it had   its own a la carte streaming service before getting into   originals. That company's culture also prizes innovation,   risk-taking, and failure, and it launched its original   programming in 2013, giving it a significant head start over   Apple. Thanks to its Prime subscriber base, the company quickly   found an audience for its shows. In comparison, Apple under Tim   Cook seems more content to leverage its current assets and   products into new revenue streams rather than build fresh   ones.If Apple wishes to give away original programming to its Apple   Music subscribers, it may be able to build viewership like Amazon   did. But Apple doesn't have the same interest in adding perks to   Apple Music the way Amazon does with Prime. Ultimately, the   company needs to find a way to grow profits, and original TV   seems unlikely to do that either directly or indirectly as its   impact on hardware sales would probably be limited.Apple's track record in television so far also bodes poorly   for its ambitions, as the company seems unclear of its ultimate   goal and is unable to successfully negotiate with media partners.   With its hardware sales stalling, Apple has increasingly turned   to services like Apple Music or Apple Pay, but the relationship   between its devices and TV seems tenuous at best. Rather than   entering the increasingly competitive media environment, the   company would be better off leading with its strength, directly   investing in research and development that would advance hardware   sales or develop its next blockbuster product..10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Bad News for Apple: Plenty of People Think the iPhone 6s Is Good Enough;January 24, 2017, 06:48:00 PM EDT;"The iPhone 7 didn't have a killer feature (no headphone jack   doesn't count). Image source: Apple.It goes without saying thatApple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) singular goal with every year's iPhone upgrade   cycle is to provide just enough new features to coax legions of   its loyal fans into upgrading to the latest and greatest model --   ideally every single year. It's also clear that this has proven   increasingly difficult, as smartphones these days are so good   that it's hard to imagine the company releasing groundbreaking or   revolutionary features anymore.makeArticleAd();Unfortunately, that may also be true of the most recent iPhone   7. Even personally, 2016 was thefirst time in eight yearsthat I didn't upgrade to the newest model.Word on the StreetBarclaysanalyst Mark Moskowitz has just put out a research note (viaTech Trader Daily), downgrading shares from overweight to equal weight, which is   the equivalent of dropping his rating from buy to hold. The   analyst also reduced his price target by $2 to $117, which is   notably slightly below current prices.Investors have seen plenty of signs that the smartphone market   has been weakening for a year or two, a trend that's not letting   up anytime soon. Moskowitz's research suggests that many   smartphone customers are increasingly picking 2015's iPhone 6s   instead of 2016's iPhone 7, the former of which costs $100 less.   Lacking any killer, must-have features, the new model simply   doesn't justify the $100 premium in many consumers' minds.That's largely why Moskowitz has reduced his average selling   price (ASP) estimate from $650 to $648. That $2 difference may   not sound like a lot, but keep in mind we're talking about   roughly 220 million iPhone units that the analyst expects the   company to sell in 2017. A $2 difference in ASP translates into   $440 million less in revenue. For reference, Apple sold 211.9   million iPhones last fiscal year (which ended in September),   generating $136.7 billion in revenue, which translates into an   ASP of $645.Smartphones are also seeing upgrade cycles elongate, as the   product category matures and people are keeping their phones for   longer and longer. Currently, most consumers keep their phones   from two to three years on average, but this could stretch to   three to four years, in Moskowitz's view. This same thing   happened remarkably fast in tablets, which is partially why the   iPad hit a speed bump a few years back that it has yet to recover   from, but now it's happening in Apple's most important   business.Will 8 be great?Whether or not Apple has some game-changing innovation up its   sleeve for the iPhone 8 remains to be seen, but judging from the   leaks we've seen thus far, the presumed ""iPhone 8"" is unlikely to   have some type of revolutionary feature. Things like an OLED   display, wireless charging, or edge-to-edge display are welcome   improvements, but may not be able to spur the ""super cycle"" that many analysts are expecting.Shareholders (myself included) should set their 2017   expectations to ""meh.""10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

The Top 5 Brands Millennials Love to Love;January 24, 2017, 05:08:00 PM EDT;"Market research firmMBLMhas released its latest Brand Intimacy Report, which measures the   emotional attachment consumers have to various brands. The study   reveals that a strong connection is a key ingredient to a better   relationship with customers. This translates to better results   for the company over the long term, and likely will have a   positive effect on its stock price.There's additional evidence that these customers are willing   to pay a premium for those preferred brands. Let's look at the   brands that have the strongest attachments for millennials and   why.makeArticleAd();Total Return Pricedata byYCharts.Nintendo enjoys a resurgence. Image source:Pixabay.5. Nintendo(NASDAQOTH: NTDOY) . Having grown up with Nintendo, millennials   have an emotional attachment to the company and its games. The   first of the millennials were just old enough to begin playingSuper Mario Brotherswhen it launched in late 1985, and continued with fan favorites   likeZelda,Final Fantasy,Tetris, andPokemon. Nintendo acknowledged those ties last year in a Father's Day   press release, saying, ""For dads today, especially the   millennials, Nintendo was a big part of their childhood.""Not content to rest on its laurels, the company is enjoying a   resurgence with the popularity ofPokemon Go, its mobile augmented-reality game, which sends users on a   virtual scavenger hunt for its characters. In its most recent   quarter, Nintendo reported hardware sales that rose 19% over the   previous year, and reports indicate that the release of the   next-generation game is imminent.Millennials just want their technology to work. Image     source: Author.4. Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) . Most millennials would have just been entering   their earning years with the release of the iPhone in 2007. The   introduction of the iPod six years earlier and it's 80% market   share provided a perfect transition.Research shows that, as a group, millennials are the most   dependent on their phones. Over 78% of millennials use their   phones more than two hours per day, 80% reach for their phones   first thing, and 87% report that their phones never leave their   sides.Millennials have grown up with technology and expect it to   work, so dependability is important to them.Reader's Digestcalled iPhones the most trusted mobile phone brand for 2016. That   level of familiarity, coupled with reliability, breeds a certain   attachment.Netflix and chill. Image source: Netflix.3. Netflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) . Netflix is becoming the new normal, and nowhere   is that more apparent than among millennials. As a group, this   demographic was born in the information age and is more tech   savvy than previous generations, so streaming Netflix is a   natural.In the decade since Netflix began streaming, it has been   embraced by the generation that now outnumbers baby boomers.   MBLM's Managing Partner Mario Natarelli said, ""We found that   escapist brands performed especially well -- mostly in the media   and entertainment industry -- due to...the need for distraction,   control and enjoyment."" Netflix and chill, baby. Netflix and   chill.Placing web orders is a cinch. Image source: Amazon.2. Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) . Millennials grew up watching their parents order   items in the little smiley boxes, and now embrace it themselves.   Placing orders from a website, or on a mobile app, is a cinch for   this tech-comfortable bunch. Previous studies have shown   millennials view Amazon as their most relevant brand, as   well. It applies as an escapist play in the same manner as   Netflix, via its Prime streaming service.Millennials' social networking proclivities play a part, as   they share their product opinions, and solicit the views of   others. This plays directly to Amazon's DNA of customer reviews.   As consumers, millennials also collaborate with the brands they   connect with, and according to studies, they believe that   Amazon has the best customer service.The Happiest Place on Earth! Image source: Author.1. Disney(NYSE: DIS) . As much as any other company on the list, Disney   taps into the nostalgia of millennials, while remaining a part of   their present. From the young stars on the Disney channel to some   of millenials' comic book favorites coming to life on the big   screen, Disney has always been there.According to Mario Natarelli, MBLM's managing partner, ""Disney   resonates with this age group because they grew up with the   brand. It has kept up with their changing interests and now   includes popular franchises likeStar Warsand Marvel... Disney is also a mainstay for young families.""Millennials, as a group, feel strongly about their values, as   well as the companies they interact with. Walt Disney was known   for his strong sense of family values, and that affinity toward   his customers still permeates the company he founded.Each of these companies has succeeded at creating an emotional   connection with its customers, in general, and the millennial   generation, in particular. This research shows that strong   positive feelings from consumers can be one factor supporting   strong company results and better stock performance. This   provides investors with another criteria for choosing a winning   investment.Can you feel the love?10 stocks we like better than Walt DisneyWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Is Customer Satisfaction the Hidden Key to Stock Outperformance?;January 24, 2017, 04:12:00 PM EDT;"As consumers, we have all been frustrated by companies which did not meet our expectations. Either poor service or a low quality product, the end result was always the desire to do less business with the given company.However, on the other side of the coin, there are those companies out there that go above and beyond, time and time again. Those are the companies I like to frequent, and I have always wondered if these types of firms-which have a long history of satisfying their customers-end up making better investments too.Well, in this edition ofthe Dutram Report, I talk to Kevin Quigg, chief strategist of ACSI Funds, for some insights into this topic and if this idea works as an investment.Inside ACSIKevin is an expert in the American Customer Satisfaction Index, a benchmark that exists to find companies that customers either like, or would rather avoid. This is done by looking at a few key areas of the customer satisfaction process, including customer expectations, perceived value, and perceived quality.This data has proven to be extremely popular with companies, as it helps them to keep tabs on the competition and to see their relative standing among their peers too. But the data can also be used to shape the outlook for companies and to see how they are trending in terms of customer satisfaction, which can help to show which companies are moving in the right direction.ACSI's idea is that customer satisfaction leads to customer loyalty, which leads to additional consumer spending which ultimately leads to long-term stock appreciation. This intuitively makes sense, and now there is a way to use this strategy in ETF form.The ETFThis is via ACSI Funds' American Customer Satisfaction Core Alpha ETF (ACSI). This product holds securities that have high ACSI customer satisfaction scores, with the theory being that these will outperform their low-satisfaction peers.Current holdings include well-respected names like Apple (AAPL), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Alphabet (GOOG) just to name a few, though there are dozens of names in the portfolio. And if you are wondering what is done for sectors where customer satisfaction levels aren't as readily available, such as energy or materials, big ETFs-such as XLE or XLB-are utilized in order to give more market-like exposure.Bottom LineFor a more in-depth look at this index as well as its investable counterpart, make sure to listen to the podcast for additional information. We highlight some of the strengths and potential pitfalls when it comes to this strategy, and how it might fit into a portfolio too.So, make sure to listen to this edition ofthe Dutram Reportfor a closer look at this novel segment of the equity world for some one-of-a-kind insights into this market, and the potential for investors to exploit this simple idea for their portfolios.

Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) Q4 Earnings Preview: Pixel & Home Could Fuel Growth;January 24, 2017, 04:05:00 PM EDT;"As per usual, all eyes will be on the company formerly known as Google, Alphabet Inc.GOOGL, as the tech giant prepares to release its fourth-quarter earnings report on Thursday. The company rolled out its new Google Pixel phone and ushered in a new era of hardware-software interaction during the quarter, making this week's announcement even more important than usual.In fact, the Google Pixel will most likely be the most compelling aspect of Alphabet's latest report, and investors will be clamoring to know how the device sold. It will also be interesting to see what the company says about its Google Home Controller, which also launched in the U.S. this quarter.The Google Pixel is important because it is Alphabet's first high-end smartphone entirely produced in-house and represents a significant challenge to Apple'sAAPLiPhone line. The Google Home tells another story of competition; the ""Internet of Things"" in-home hub is one of the only competitors to Amazon'sAMZNEcho speaker.More importantly, both of these products underscore Alphabet's efforts to usher in its intelligent personal assistant software, Google Assistant. With similar functions to Apple's Siri and Microsoft'sMSFTCortana, Google Assistant is the backbone of the Pixel and Home devices and promises to be the foundation for all of Google's original products heading forward.Also, investors should not forget about the other products that Google launched in the quarter, all of which were officially unveiled at the same event in October. The company debuted its stylish headset for the Daydream VR platform, the ""Daydream View,"" as well as its first router, ""Google Wifi,"" and a Chromecast update, ""Chromecast Ultra.""All of these products are important pieces of Google's effort to create a complete line of products that work together and with the new Google Assistant software. This is just the first quarter of sales, but it is also the holiday quarter and should give us a good idea of whether or not these products are resonating with shoppers.Heading into the report, Alphabet Inc. has seen one positive estimate revision over the past week. Our current consensus estimates indicate EPS growth of 8.40% and sales growth of 18.75%, and this has helped earn the company an ""A"" grade for growth. This is especially noteworthy given the relative size and status of Alphabet already. Overall, the stock has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), and that's always a good sign heading into an earnings announcement.Nevertheless, Alphabet currently has an Earnings ESP of -0.26%, which makes surprise prediction a bit more difficult.Zacks' Top 10 Stocks for 2017In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest tickers for the entirety of 2017?Who wouldn't?

Why 2017 Will Be the Year of the Virtual Assistant;January 24, 2017, 03:32:00 PM EDT;"In its annual mobile apps survey, Research firm Gartner   predicted that by 2019 virtual assistants will account for20% of all smartphone interactions. With that level of user engagement,  predictably all of   the largest technology companies are invested in the segment and   each brings a different strength to the field.Will 2017 be the year of the virtual assistant?  Image   source: Pixabay.makeArticleAd();Amazon Echo powered by Alexa. Image source: Amazon.com.AmazonMany media reports  are callingAmazon's(NASDAQ: AMZN) Alexa the hit of the Consumer Electronics Show.    In 2015, Amazon made a skills kit available to developers   that allowed partners to incorporate voice commands. Fast forward   to 2017 and Alexa can integrate with an estimated 5,000   third-party apps,  from refrigerators to TV's, from cars to   vacuums, and lest we forget, the Echo smart home speaker.    The novelty of this device made it among the top selling   items on Amazon's website during the holidays. This was a   brilliant strategic move by a company without a smartphone as an   installed base. Amazon does, however, have a roster of well-known   companies in its corner including Ford, Samsung and LG to name a   few. In addition to product integration, Alexa can be found in a   dizzying number of bots that can order a pizza from Domino's,   schedule an Uber, or check your Capital One balance. This gives   Amazon the early lead in terms of reach and momentum, but the   lack of a mobile device means that challenges remain.Apple's Siri. Image source: Apple.AppleApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) , represented in the category by Siri, hasn't seen   much love. Her earliest incarnation could only answer correctly   about 65% of the time,  and users complained that far too   often she defaulted to Google rather than answering the question.   Consumers tend to remember those early first experiences, and   Siri still has a bad reputation. She shouldn't be counted out   yet, though. Apple has been taking steps to improve Siri's   understanding. In mid-2014, Siri's brain was replaced by an   artificial intelligence (AI) based neural network and Apple   claims that Siri now has a less than 5% error rate. Apple argues   that it isn't necessary to upload all of your data to the cloud   in order for Siri to improve. It uses a technique called   differential privacy, which keeps individual information at the   local phone level and protects user privacy.  Though it   currently doesn't have a, Echo-like voice-activated speaker,reports indicatethat a prototype is currently in the testing stage.Google Home powered by Google Assistant. Image source:     Google.AlphabetAlphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google has introduced Google   Assistant, which expands on the capabilities of Google Now and OK   Google. This assistant is currently available on its Pixel phones   and can be accessed on other smartphones via the Google Allo app.   This virtual helper is more conversational and has produced   impressive early results due to experiences gained from its   predecessors. It was found to rival and in many cases surpass its   nearest competitors. Assistant's greatest strength may be the   ability to answer follow-up questions, a feature many of its   rivals lack. Integration with Google Home smart speaker puts it   squarely in competition with Amazon's Echo. Its strengths include   entire home synchronized audio and grouping of smart-home   commands.Some researchersbelieve that Alexa will cede its early lead in the category to   Google Assistant by 2020.Microsoft Cortana. Image source: Microsoft.MicrosoftMicrosoft's(NASDAQ: MSFT) Cortana is available across its Windows 10-based   devices including phones, tablets and PC's. It has many competing   features, but has exhibited difficulties responding to requests,   reminiscent of Siri's early days. Microsoft announced late last   year that it would open Cortana to third party integration, so   expect a number of hardware integrations on the horizon. It has   yet to introduce an interactive speaker, but its first hardware   partner is Harman Kardon and one is expected sometime this year.    In a shrewd move, the kit used by developers is remarkably   similar to that of Alexa, allowing them to piggyback off the work   they have already done. This will accelerate the process of   producing hardware that will integrate Cortana.Near-ubiquitous technologyThose interested in a task-based comparison between the four   might findthis articlebyBusiness Insiderof interest. Despite the varying capabilities among these   entries, one thing is clear: nearly every person with a computer,   tablet, smartphone, or home speaker system will have access to a   virtual personal assistant in the coming year. With this level of   exposure, consumers will begin to adopt these virtual assistants,   and as the technology becomes more advanced, providers will find   new, more innovative ways to incorporate them into our everyday   lives. Society is still in the early stages of the adoption cycle   for these digital helpers, but it appears that this year is the   tipping point.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock       tip, it can pay to listen.

Reviewing Samsung's Q4 2016 Figures And What Lies Ahead;January 24, 2017, 02:06:56 PM EDT;"Samsung Electronics (SSNLF) published its Q4 2016 results on Tuesday, posting its highest operating profit in over three years, as a strong market for semiconductor products and the depreciation of the Korean Won helped the company overcome some setbacks faced by its smartphone division, following the discontinuation of its fire-prone Note 7 smartphones in Q3. While overall revenues remained almost flat at53.33 trillion won ($45.8 billion), operating profits expanded by about 50% to 9.22 trillion won ($7.9 billion). Samsung expects earnings to improve in 2017, as the company takes advantage of strong semiconductor pricing and stable demand, although the smartphone unit could face some challenges, amid higher marketing costs, slowing global smartphone shipment growth and mounting competition. Below we take a look at some of the key factors that drove Samsung's performance over the last quarter and what to expect in 2017.We have a$1,340 price estimate for Samsung Electronics, which is slightly ahead of the current market price.See our complete analysis for SamsungmakeArticleAd();SemiconductorUnit Outperforms On Tight Supply And Samsung's High-End FocusSamsung's semiconductor business had a solid quarter, with revenues rising by 12.5% to 14.86 trillion won ($12.74 billion), and operating profits growing by about 77% to a record 4.95 trillion won ($4.24 billion), driven largely by the memory business. Supply-demand conditions in the memory market have been tight, with mobile OEMs increasing memory content on devices, effectively bolstering demand for NAND modules, while PC DRAM is seeing some under-supply, as major vendors have been reducing their production mix in favor of mobile DRAM, boosting prices. While Samsung has been benefiting from the broader market tailwinds, the company's technology edge and its focus on higher value products also appear to be paying off.For instance, Samsung is focusing on high density/performance DRAM over commodity DRAM, while expanding process migration to the 48-layer 3D V-NAND. Samsung is looking improve its process technologies further in 2017, migrating to to 1x-nm DRAM and 64-layer V-NAND, driving down costs. The company's system LSI business, which manufactures processors, also aided Q4 earnings, driven by strong demand for mid-to-low end app processors. 2017 is expected to be an important year for the LSI division, as Samsung looks to ramp-up production of the next generation 10-nm products from its foundry operations. These chips, which could be a fixture of high-end smartphones in 2017, are touted to be more battery efficient, while offering better performance and a smaller form factor.Smartphone Business Largely Shrugs Off Note 7 ImpactSamsung's smartphone division fared reasonably well, despite the Note 7 recall which occurred in late Q3. Although segment revenues declined by about 5.5% year-over-year to 23.61 trillion won ($20.27 billion), operating profits rose by about 12% to 2.5 trillion won ($2.15 billion). Profitability for the quarter was aided by strong sales of the company's flagship Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge, which have higher margins, as well as sales of its mid-range smartphones such as the A and J series. That said, things are likely to remain subdued over Q1 2017, as Samsung is increasing its marketing spending in order to rebuild its brand following the Note 7 crisis.  Moreover, the company's upcoming Galaxy S8 flagship is likely to launch in Q2, moving away from the March launch cycle that the company adopted with the S7. The upcoming device will be crucial to Samsung, as the company looks to restore its image as a vendor of cutting-edge smartphones, while contending with increasing competition in the high-end of the smartphone market as Apple preps to launch a completely redesigned iPhone later this year, while Google ramps up sales and distribution of its critically acclaimed Pixel devices.

CVX Stock: How to Trade Chevron Corporation Q4 Earnings;January 24, 2017, 12:44:33 PM EDT;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsEnergy giant andDow Jones Industrial AverageconstituentChevron Corporation(NYSE:CVX) reports earnings Friday morning. In the days leading up to the event, traders and investors alike are both asking themselves whether Chevron will trump fourth-quarter earnings expectations, or whether the corporate confessional will cause a spill in CVX stock.Source:swong95765 via Flickr (Modified)Let's take a look at recent announcements for Chevron, analyze the CVX stock chart and determine what (if anything) the options market is suggesting will come Friday.makeArticleAd();Then, we'll set up a trade to help you capture profits from the announcement.Chevron Earnings Picture and Analyst   SentimentAhead of Chevron's Friday morning Q4 earnings release, analysts are forecasting profits of 66 cents per share. Actual estimates encompass a very wide range from 35 cents to $1.15.The mean Street expectation implies a whopping 154% earnings growth year-over-year, as Chevron reported a mere 26 cents in profit in 2016. That result came up short of views by more than 50%. We're not holding our breath, but if Wall Street is on the money this time, the 66-cent profit would represent a sequential decline of 8.3% from Q3, which surprised by 31.5% to the upside.Revenues are estimated to grow by 26% to $36.7 billion compared to 2015's sales of $29.2 billion. Here too, range views are volatile, with a low forecast of $27.2 billion compared to a Street high of $62 billion. Sequentially, CVX's revenues are forecast to jump by 22%.10 Stocks to Buy to Survive a ""Trumpsy-Turvy""     2017The Wall Street community is split on Chevron stock. Eighteen rate the stock a buy, while 10 maintain hold ratings. Price targets on CVX range from a low of $95 to $145 with a median estimate of $125.50 over the year.CVX Stock Short-Term Trading RecordIf it isn't obvious yet, Chevron has established a mixed record compared to actual Street profit views. Over the past couple years, CVX has beaten forecasts 58% of the time, while missing 42%.Investor reaction has proven a bit more consistent, with gains in four of the past six announcements immediately following earnings.Working backwards, CVX stock has moved 3.91%, 0.68%, -0.21%, 0.63%, 1.10% and -4.89% on a close-to-close basis. The net reaction in Chevron has produced an average gain of 0.2% in the first full session of trading. Variability of 2.86% based on a one standard deviation reading yields an estimated range of -2.66% to 3.06%.In other words, Chevron doesn't often move that much.CVX's seven-day performance has also allowed for a fairly benign average result, with shares falling marginally by 0.23%. However, the longer period has been accompanied by a much larger standard deviation of 5.14% and bumpier forecast range of -5.37% to 4.91%.CVX Stock Weekly ChartClick to EnlargeShares of Chevron are in an uptrend and providing a nice, lower-risk pullback entry point. The provided weekly view shows a corrective move of nearly 49% followed by a bullish uptrend, which began back in late 2014.Currently, CVX stock is in the process of establishing a minor counter-move of several weeks. The overall shape of the pattern resembles a bullish weekly cup-and-handle.With the handle or pullback situated above the 62% retracement level and longer-term weekly moving averages, bullish traders are provided plenty of technical support. That said, these supports comprise a fairly wide price range in CVX stock.Testing of the penetrated 50% level and 50-week simple moving average near $102.50-$104 is roughly 10% to 11% below the current share price in CVX. Such a price drop wouldn't invalidate the uptrend, but the allowance for the current handle would certainly be compromised.How to Trade CVX StockThe spread between implied and underlying volatility in CVX has widened over the past month. Not only is 30-day implied volatility mostly flat, but it continues to trade in a very narrow price band - from about 15% to just above 20% over the past few months.At the same time, statistical volatility of CVX stock has fallen to around 12% and fresh two-year lows.Sell GoPro Inc Stock on This Pointless Karma     Rally (GPRO)The at-the-money 27 Jan $116 straddle market points to a 68% chance BAC will remain within an approximate price range of $113.40 to $118.60 into Friday's expiration. The math behind the calculated range is based on implied volatility of 25%, three trading sessions and shares of Chevron at $116.The purest play on the earnings event is the weekly contract. Even during quiet periods like the one CVX stock is witnessing now, those premiums reflect what traders collectively expect to happen in the stock in the immediate aftermath of earnings.The dollar move up or down works out to wiggle room of about 2.26% by Friday's close - a fairly quiet and typical event.Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do   not currently own positions in any of the securities or their   derivatives mentioned in this article.

Better Buy: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. vs. NXP Semiconductors;January 24, 2017, 11:30:00 AM EDT;"NXP Semiconductors(NASDAQ: NXPI) andAdvanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD) both operate in the semiconductor industry. That's   about as far as their similarity goes. One is a rising star in   embedded solutions and automotive computing, heading into a $47   billion merger with sector giantQualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM) . The other is an eternal underdog in the PC   market that's working on a dramatic turnaround right now.Which chip stock is a better fit for your portfolio? Let's   find out.The heart of the matterThe choice between AMD and NXP boils down to two simple   questions:makeArticleAd();Do you expect Qualcomm's buyout of NXP to run into any     issues in the regulatory review phase? If so, NXP shares should     fall when the merger is deep-sixed and AMD should be the     obvious investment pick.Otherwise, NXP becomes a simple ticket to 14% returns by     the end of 2017. Can AMD beat that 11-month payoff?Is NXP's deal safe?I have often said that the Qualcomm-NXP combinationlooks like a lock. The two companies share very few customers and end markets, so   this merger is not likely to create any sort of monopoly.   Regulatory roadblocks would have to focus on the sheer scale of   the buyout. Moreover, President Donald Trump is paving the way to   easier megamergers by nominating anti-regulation candidates to   many key government roles. So, this buyout should be a   cakewalk.Unfortunately, that high-odds risk has suddenly become more   likely.Last week,Qualcomm was served a lawsuitfrom major customerApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) , wherein the iPhone maker claims that the   chipmaker has been playing extortion games with its component   supply chain.Qualcomm shares fell as much as 14% on the news, and some   analysts expect the lawsuit to delay the NXP deal. Renewed   scrutiny of Qualcomm's business practices could block   rubber-stamp deal approvals in important territories such as   China, Taiwan, and South Korea.The Apple charge will also divert management attention and   other assets from the NXP process. If nothing else, the final   approval might be pushed into 2018 or beyond.This is a real risk for the NXP merger, but I still expect the   final signatures to be delivered by the end of the year. This   business combination is too important to let it slide out of   view. And don't forget that regulatory intervention would lead to   Qualcomm sending a $1.25 billion breakup fee NXP's way.Your mileage may vary, which is fine. But if you agree with my   analysis, NXP remains a near-certain 14% return from here, and   AMD needs to show a stronger hand than that.Image source: Getty Images.What can AMD do?Let's cut to the chase: AMD shares could go absolutely   anywhere in 2017. That's enough to keep my finger away from the   buy button.The chipmaker had a fantastic year in 2016. AMD introduced a   new graphics chip architecture to rave reviews, promised an   equally game-changing update to its CPU portfolio in 2017, andsaw share prices quadruple. AMD's chart has cooled down a bit in January, falling back 12%   as the company prepares for a fourth-quarter report next week.   But that's still a lot of market momentum. Share prices could   keep skyrocketing in 2017 if the company continues to deliver on   its next-generation technology promises.That's a bigif, though. AMD does not have a great track record when it comes to   dependable execution, and often falls far short of ambitious   goals. Recently appointed CEO Lisa Su has been a breath of fresh   air so far, but she is battling the fallout from nearly a   decade's worth of less-successful predecessors.If AMD's momentum runs out, the stock has a long way to fall.   AMD's trailing earnings and EBITDA profits are negative, and free   cash flows stand at a razor-thin $148 million. Lacking the   support of traditional valuation builders, the stock chart would   take a dramatic nosedive in a hurry on the slightest of   errors.AMD owners can win big or lose big here. That's a poker chip,   not an investment thesis.By contrast, NXP offers a near-guaranteed 14% return. Even if   the Qualcomm deal falls apart, there's a quick $1.25 billion cash   payment in it for NXP investors.This one isn't a close call. I would take NXP over AMD in a   heartbeat.10 stocks we like better than Advanced Micro     DevicesWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Earnings Preview: Can Apple, Inc. Return to Growth?;January 24, 2017, 10:36:00 AM EDT;"Scheduled to report results for its first fiscal quarter of   2017 on Tuesday, Jan. 31,Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL)  will show whether it has returned to revenue   growth. With trailing-12-month revenue down 8%, even a small   year-over-year increase in Apple's first-quarter revenue would be   a nice change.Here's a preview of the earnings report as well as some   background on a few key areas worth checking in on when the tech   giant reports results.makeArticleAd();Image source: Apple.The numbersMetricQ1 2017 Guidance*Q1 2016Year-Over-Year ChangeRevenue$77 billion$75.9 million1.4%Earnings per share$3.17$3.28(3.4%)Gross profit margin38.25%40.1%(185 basis points)Fiscal quarters shown. Asterisk indicates figures are based on   midpoint of guidance ranges provided for management. Data for   chart retrieved from Apple's quarterly earnings releases. Table   by author.After reporting three quarters straight of year-over-year   declines in revenue, Apple expects about a 1.4% year-over-year   increase in revenue in its first quarter. But despite   expectations for higher revenue, management anticipates a 3.4%   earnings decline as its profit margin is negatively impacted by   currency headwinds, higher cost structures for new products, and   an unfavorable comparison due to a $548 million award from a   patent infringement in the year-ago quarter.3 key areas to watchBeyond Apple's first-quarter revenue, EPS, and gross profit   margin, investors should look at iPhone sales, guidance for   Apple's second quarter, and services revenue growth.1. iPhone sales:Accounting for 63% of Apple's trailing-12-month revenue,   the iPhone segment is undoubtedly the company's most important   business. The segment dwarfs its other segments, which represent   11% or less of trailing-12-month sales.iPhone 7. Image source: Apple.So, what can investors expect from iPhone sales? Given Apple's   guidance for its overall results and the influence of the iPhone   segment on total results, investors should expect similar iPhone   revenue and unit sales this year since Apple is only guiding for   a 1.4% increase in total revenue. In the year-ago quarter, iPhone   revenue was $51.6 billion and iPhone unit sales were 74.8   million.2. Guidance:One of the quarter's most insightful metrics will be the   guidance Apple provides for its second quarter. With this figure,   investors will get to see whether management expects more revenue   growth.Given that the iPhone 7 didn't stick to Apple's usual biannual   schedule for form factor overhauls, it's possible the company   could return to year-over-year declines in the second quarter.   But until it provides guidance, there isn't any clear indication   of what investors should expect for the trajectory of revenue   beyond its first quarter.3. Services revenue growth:One segment that could help drive surprising growth is the   services segment, which includes sales from the App Store,   iTunes, Apple Music, iCloud, Apple Pay, licensing, and other   services. In the most recent quarter, services revenue was up an   impressive 24%, hitting a record $6.3 billion. Growing to   13% of Apple's revenue in the quarter, services is now its   second-largest segment. If the segment benefited from a   significant holiday boost in the first quarter, the growing   segment may play a key role in helping Apple's overall revenue   this year -- possibly even serving as the key factor for   preventing further declines in total revenue.In its most recent quarter, year-over-year services revenue   growth accelerated from 19% in the third quarter of fiscal 2016   to 24% in its fourth quarter. Look to see if Apple can maintain   this higher growth rate achieved in its fourth quarter.In addition to the first-quarter report after market close on   Jan. 31, management will host a live conference call to discuss   results at 2:00 p.m. PST.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Stock Market News for January 24, 2017;January 24, 2017, 10:10:00 AM EDT;"All the key U.S. indexes fell on Monday following rising uncertainties regarding Trump's economic policies. However, benchmarks pared some of yesterday's losses after the President announced to reduce financial regulations and corporate taxes. Separately, record rise in U.S. rig counts weighed onoil prices, which in turn dragged energy stocks. Additionally, investors swallowed mixed bag of earnings results.For a look at the issues currently facing the markets, make sure to read today'sAhead of Wall Streetarticle.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) decreased 0.1%, to close at 19,799.85. The S&P 500 fell 0.3% to close at 2,265.20. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 5,552.94, losing 2.39 points. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) advanced 2% to settle at 11.77. A total of around 6.15 billion shares were traded on Monday, in line with the last 20-session average. Advancers outpaced declining stocks on the NYSE. For 52% stocks that advanced, 44% declined.What Weighed On the Benchmarks?The 45thU.S. President announced that the U.S. has formally exited from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade deal with eleven other Pacific Rim nations. Moreover, during the weekend Trump announced that he will meet with his Mexican counterpart Pena Nieto and the Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Trump's ""protectionist"" approach raised uncertainty among investors over his policies.This in turn had a broad-based negative impact on key U.S. indexes. However, Trump stated that his administration may slash regulations by 75 percent or ""maybe more,"" which helped markets trim some of the losses.Separately, oil prices fell on Friday after Baker Hughes Incorporated (BHI) reported that U.S. oil and gas rig counts rose by 35 to 694 rigs last week, its biggest increase in almost six years. The U.S. oil rig count also increased by 29 rigs to 551, its biggest increase in less than four years. Both WTI and Brent crude fell 0.9% and 0.5% to $52.75 per barrel and $55.32 a barrel, respectively.Additionally, shares of Halliburton Company (HAL) fell 2.9% after its fourth-quarter revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, the world's No. 2 oilfield-services company posted better-than-expected quarterly earnings. (Read More)Decline in oil prices and fall in Halliburton led the Energy Select Sector SPDR (XLE) to fall 1.1% and was the worst performing sector in the S&P 500. Key stocks from the sector including Transocean Ltd. (RIG) and Schlumberger Limited (SLB) fell 3.6% and 2.6%, respectively. Both the companies possess a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Should You Buy Valeant Pharmaceuticals Intl Inc (VRX) Stock? 3 Pros, 3 Cons;January 24, 2017, 09:52:23 AM EDT;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsValeant Pharmaceuticals Intl Inc(NYSE:VRX) has imploded over the past 18 months. VRX stock is down nearly 95% since it peaked in 2015. The company has made a fool of many famous investors, including famed activist Bill Ackman. What was once one of Canada's most exciting growth companies now sits at death's doorstep.Source:Wikimedia (Modified)With its market cap down to below $5 billion now, the question has become existential. Can Valeant survive? Or will it end up in bankruptcy court?makeArticleAd();For investors in VRX stock, it's a matter of handicapping. Valeantcouldbe a multi-bagger if it survives. However, there's a good chance the stock ends up at zero. Thus, what's an investor to do?Let's look at the pros and the cons for VRX stock to decide.VRX Stock ConsImploded Business Model:Ackman famously loaded up his huge position in VRX stock on the basis of ""platform value."" This was the idea that Valeant was worth a great deal due to its ability to keep acquiring new drugs. Once Valeant acquired a new drug company, it typically would raise prices for the acquired drugs while slashing R&D spending and other overhead. This made for fantastic margins.Valeant borrowed heavily to make these acquisitions using the assumption that drug prices could continue rising indefinitely. This assumption, however, proved false following increasing scrutiny toward the sector from 2015 onward. VRX also engaged in some questionable business behavior, including using gray-area specialty pharma operations to push drugs at high prices. This window of opportunity has shut. Valeant has greatly limited capacity to raise drug prices going forward, and it doesn't have financial capacity to make further acquisitions.10 Blue-Chip Stocks That Could Be Holding You     BackNeed to Sell Assets:In fact, the opposite is true. Valeant is having todumpassets. And a forced seller rarely gets top dollar for their goods. For a year now, Valeant management has talked up imminent asset sales. Rumors of aSalixsale for as much as $10 billion sent VRX stock flying.But that rumor, as with most such Valeant rumors, amounted to nothing. Valeant did manage to sell two smaller non-core businesses early in January, leading to a smaller pop in VRX stock. But that quickly gave way. The EBITDA multiples, particularly for theDendreonunit, received on the asset sales do not appear high enough to justify the company's current valuation. Valeant likely has to sell more assets to avoid breaching debt covenants. And based on the past year's efforts, it could be difficult to sell more properties at acceptable prices.Huge Debt Load:Valeant sports about $30 billion in debt, against a minimal cash position. And virtually all of this debt is due no later than 2022. A sizable chunk matures in 2018.Thus, Valeant is racing against the clock to come up with cash before it has to make good on its debt obligations. If lenders are generous, the company may be able to roll some of its debt over, though the interest rate would probably be unfavorable. Otherwise, it will have to sell yet more assets to stay liquid in the short-term.VRX Stock ProsAsset Sales a Step in the Right Direction:While there is much more work to be done, Valeant's asset sales earlier this month are a clear positive. The company likely will have enough cash to make it through to 2018. Many prominent bears were suggesting that Valeant would go bankrupt in 2017. That looks significantly less likely now.While VRX has much more to do, $2.1 billion is certainly a step in the right direction. The Dendreon business they sold was of low quality, and they appear to have gotten a decent price for it, all things considered. And the business they sold toL'oreal SA (ADR)(OTCMKTS:LRLCY) went at a solid price, though it was one of Valeant's highest-quality assets.Heavy Bearish Involvement: Valeant has attracted numerous short sellers. As of data from December 31st, there are 29 million shares of VRX stock that have been sold short. That constitutes more than 11% of the total float. Since at least August, short sellers have maintained a short position in excess of 25 million Valeant shares.Numerous big-name short sellers, such as Citron Research and John Hempton of Bronte Capital, have devoted numerous time to blasting the company. Hempton tends tomake commentssuch as: ""Valeant deserves to go bankrupt - and will go bankrupt unless the goodwill of bond holders and pharmaceutical payers is forthcoming.""7 Stocks to Sell Before They ImplodeThese are talented market operators, and there's a decent chance they'll be proven right. But if not, bears may find themselves stuck in a position that changes character on them. Bill Ackman isn't the only pro to ride a position for too long on occasion.Better Drug Market Optics?President-elect Donald Trump will take office shortly. He's made some prickly remarks about the drug industry over the past few months, notably saying that pharma is ""getting away with murder."" That sounds bad. However, so far at least, he still appears more moderate on the issue. Hillary Clinton took to Twitter on various occasions to call out individual pharma companies and/or their executives.Trump's repeal-and-replace rhetoric is a question mark for the healthcare industry. But it's an improvement from what would almost certainly have been a painful four years for pharma stocks had the alternative occurred. Healthcare performed worst of the S&P 500's 10 sectors last year. Unless Trump's words turn into concrete action against the drug companies, there is a good chance that sentiment picks up later this year in the sector.VerdictVRX stock seems appealing as a sort of high-risk high-reward play on the surface. Shares are way down off the peak. The company seems to have put the worst behind it, and is starting to make the right moves on asset sales and new management direction. But oh what a hole they had dug for themselves.Valeant is in a race against the clock, and they need a lot of things to go correctly to avoid bankruptcy. There is too high a chance of the company failing before the cycle turns for me to consider this as anything more than a long-shot speculation.As of this writing, Ian Bezek did not hold a position in any   of the aforementioned securities.

Additionally, traders are also taking a   wait-and-see approach to President Donald Trump's first 100 days   in office, as protectionist policies are beginning to take shape.   Finally, today's economic data includes the January Markit   manufacturing report and December data on existing-home   sales.Heading into the open, futures on theDow Jones Industrial Averageare up 0.02%, whileS&P 500futures are off 0.01% andNasdaq-100futures have edged 0.05% higher.makeArticleAd();On the options front, Monday's volume fell precipitously from   Friday's expiration driven free-for-all. On the day, only about   14.8 million calls and 13.4 million puts crossed the tape. Over   on the CBOE, the single-session equity put/call volume ratio hit   a one-month high of 0.72, while the 10-day moving average   continued to hold at 0.65.Turning to Monday's volume leaders,Alibaba Group Holding Ltd(NYSE:BABA) attracted a flood of call options ahead of this morning's   third-quarter report, which saw revenue spike 54% year-over-year.   Meanwhile,Qualcomm, Inc.(NASDAQ:QCOM) was hit with anApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) lawsuit and an analyst downgrade. Finally,Intel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) also saw a spike in call volume ahead of Thursday's quarterly   earnings report.Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA)Thanks toa surge in sales on Singles Day- the largest Chinese shopping day of the year - Alibaba's   third-quarter results blew past Wall Street's expectations.10 Stocks to Buy to Survive a ""Trumpsy-Turvy""       2017For the quarter Alibaba said it earned $1.30 per share on   revenue of $7.7 billion, up 55% year-over-year. What's more,   mobile monthly active users rose 25% to 493 million, bolstering   mobile revenue to a 73% year-over-year rise.In premarket trading, BABA shares were last seen up nearly 5%   at $103.30.Heading into the report, BABA options traders were betting on   a bull run. Total volume swelled to over 572,000 contracts, with   calls snapping up 68% of the day's take. If the shares' premarket   gains carry over into the open, Alibaba will eclipse peak 27 Jan   open interest of nearly 17,000 contracts at the $100 call   strike.What's more, there is little in the way of additional call OI   north of this strike, by comparison, creating less potential   friction for follow-through buying heading into February. The   next potential technical hurdle for BABA lies at $105.Qualcomm, Inc. (QCOM)QCOM stock was hit with adouble-whammy yesterdayafter Apple filed a lawsuit and Nomura downgraded the stock from   ""buy"" to ""neutral."" Apple is seeking $1 billion for unfair   royalty charges from Qualcomm, while Nomura issued the downgrade   on licensing concerns regarding the company's acquisition ofNXP Semiconductors. Qualcomm derives 80% of its revenue from licensing.QCOM stock is up roughly 1.2% in pre-market activity, but   plunged nearly 13% in Monday's session.Options traders were shaken by the pair of reports, with puts   making up nearly half of the 482,000 contracts traded on QCOM   yesterday. After the plunge, Qualcomm dipped below peak 27 Jan   call and put OI at the $55 strike, but the shares are looking to   reclaim that perch this morning. Looking ahead of Feb. options   reveals a wealth of deep out-of-the-money call OI north of   $70.In other words, QCOM options traders may take a while to   readjust their expectations in light of Monday's news.Intel Corporation (INTC)INTC stock is fresh off a nearly 9% run from its December   lows, but the shares have begun to stall out in the $37 region.   But that hasn't stopped INTC options traders from speculating on   a resumption of that run ahead of Thursday's earnings.For the record, Intel is expected to post a profit of 75 cents   per share on revenue of $15.74 billion. The whisper number,   according toEarningsWhipsers.com, rests at 78 cents per share.How to Trade Microsoft Corporation (MSFT)       Stock After EarningsVolume came in at roughly 222,000 contracts for INTC on   Monday, as calls made up 68% of the day's take. Looking at   expectations for Thursday's report, options traders have their   sights set on $37. In fact, the 27 Jan $36.50/$37 bull call   spread appears to be quite popular, with 7,300 contracts at the   lower strike and more than 7,800 contract at the higher   strike.This spread can be had for 28 cents, or $28 per pair of   contracts, right now, though the maximum return rests at a paltry   22 cents, or $22 per pair of contracts.As of this writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a position     in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 Companies That Should Be in the Dow       Jones7 Straight-A Stocks to Build Your Portfolio       AroundThe postTuesday's Vital Data: Alibaba Group Holding Ltd   (BABA), Qualcomm, Inc.

Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA) Stock Will Hit All-Time Highs Soon;January 24, 2017, 09:44:42 AM EDT;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSome of the reports covering the record-breaking quarter ofAlibaba Group Holding Ltd.(NYSE:BABA), announced before the market opened on Jan. 24, were just a bit misleading. Luckily, those trading BABA stock weren't fooled.Source: ShutterstockA 26% fall in earnings? Maybe, if you squint right, and you're looking for something to criticize, you can argue that earnings fell short.makeArticleAd();But that was entirely due to investments made in digital media that will come back over time. And the growth in digital media sales, 273%, was a star of the earnings show. Entertainment even grew faster than the company's cloud computing operations, and total revenue was up 54%.If this is miss, I'll take it.Investors agree. Pre-market trading had BABA stock up to almost $102 per share, or about 4% higher. It's still short of 2016's high of $107 per share, and well short of the $115 per share achieved in early 2015.But right now those records look due to fall.Several Moving PiecesAlibaba has several moving pieces, anda detailed earnings releaseoffered real insight into them.The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for 2017: The     Experts' PicksWhat the release reveals is that if you're thinking of Alibaba as strictly a play on China, you're thinking wrong. The fastest-growing segment of the business is ""international commerce,"" cross-border trade, mostly between China and other countries in East Asia, which was up 288% year-over-year, to $353 million, 4% of total revenue. That's even faster than digital entertainment grew.Chinese commerce still represents 80% of revenue, but that's down from 86% a year earlier, even though retail sales were up 42% and wholesale sales were up 30%. It's that wholesale number that is the heart of the original company. Alibaba, unlikeAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN), with which it is so often compared, was founded to enable business-to-business commerce, opening up global markets for small Chinese producers.Taken together, Alibaba had GAAP net income of $2.471 billion ($1 per share) and revenue of $7.669 billion. Just as Amazon remains a fraction of the size ofWal-Mart Stores, Inc.(NYSE:WMT), in other words, Alibaba is a fraction of the size of Amazon.But BABA is growing faster.Where Does BABA Stock Grow From Here?While Alibaba does seek to replicate most of what Amazon does, including its movies and cloud operations, at the heart of the growth story lies trading.Trading is profitable. You don't have to buy what someone else is trading, just handle the logistics - the online elements, the transaction elements, the movement and warehousing. Thus, Alibaba has been able to deliver regular profits at a stage where Amazon could not, and this remains the case.Non-GAAP earnings of $1.30 per share easily beat the analyst estimates of $1.13, and even the whisper number of $1.16. The big numbers remain in consumer commerce within China, dominated this quarter by a record-setting ""Singles Day,"" but the big growth is in other areas.That growth is spectacular. With its latest quarter, Alibaba raised its own growth estimates for the year, from 48% to 54%.Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Steals AI Expert Back From     Apple Inc. (AAPL)Combine Alibaba's bulk in commerce with its growth in international trade, entertainment and cloud, then add in executive chairman Jack Ma's unique ability to straddle the fence between Chinese President Xi Jinping and Donald Trump, and you get an investment story that's hard to beat. Yes, the price-to-earnings multiple of 52 looks rich, and it's going up on these numbers, but that's the way it is with a growth stock.And we haven't even mentioned Alibaba's pending takeover of China's large private shopping mall operator, Intime, or its work on artificial intelligence.If you want a piece of that, the time to buy is now.Dana   Blankenhornis a financial and technology journalist.

Apple's Supplier Foxconn to Set Up Manufacturing in U.S?;January 24, 2017, 09:25:00 AM EDT;"Per media reports, one ofApple Inc.'sAAPLbiggest suppliers, Foxconn Technology Group is thinking of setting up a manufacturing plant in the United States. Though the exact details aren't available, Foxconn is interested in investing over $7 billion in setting up such facilities in the U.S.Analysts note that that tech companies usually do not have manufacturing operations in the U.S because of higher labor costs involved than other regions like South East Asia. Apple has been subject to intense focus of President Donald Trump regarding this issue.Throughout his campaign, Trump opposed Apple's decision to manufacture goods overseas and even promised that he will urge Apple to bring manufacturing jobs back to the country. Trump was quoted speaking to The New York Times in Nov 2016, ""One of the things that will be a real achievement for me is when I get Apple to build a big plant in the United States, or many big plants in the United States, where instead of going to China, and going to Vietnam, and going to the places that you go to, you're making your product right here.""Apple Inc. PriceApple Inc. Price|Apple Inc. QuoteIn fact, to alleviate Apple's concern of increased prices of finished products, Trump told the company's CEO Tim Cook that he will provide tech companies huge tax cuts.These promised incentives seem to have succeeded in attracting manufactures. Foxconn CEO Terry Gou was quoted saying ""If US state governments are willing to provide these terms, and we calculate and it is cheaper than shipping from China or Japan, then why wouldn't Sharp build a factory in the US?"". Foxconn bought the majority stake in Sharp Technologies, which supplies display panels for many major smartphone brands, last year for $3.5 billion.Per Verge, this new facility could be in collaboration between Apple and Foxconn as Gou said that Apple, too, needs the display panels. The facilities could create 30 to 50K jobs in the U.S, something which Trump has been so focused on. However, Verge quoted Gou saying that manufacturing in the U.S will make prices go up as much as $500. So will consumers be happy about it?Moreover, analyst also remain wary as it could mean taking China head on. Setting up manufacturing in the U.S. will deprive China of many million manufacturing jobs and surely the Chinese government won't be very happy about it. Foxconn has over 12 factories in China and Chinese workers form a majority of its 1.5 million strong workforce.Gou stressed that these plans are not ""promise"" but a ""wish"" and there is also a possibility that it might not work out at all. Apple made no comment on the development.Apparently, Apple is mulling to bring back manufacturing jobs to U.S. A few days back it was reported that Apple requested the government to allow it to use its Mesa, AZ facility to conduct ""high-tech manufacturing"". Apple had asked Foreign Trade Zones Board to allow it to manufacture ""finished products and foreign status materials/components"". This is because ""production under FTZ procedures could exempt Apple from customs duty payments on the foreign-status materials/components used in export production.""Per a Business Insider report, citing sources familiar with the matter, Apple will be using the Mesa facility to ""build and configure servers"" and then send it to other data center sites in the U.S. like Oregon and North Carolina. The Mesa manufacturing facility was set up by Apple in 2013 and was leased to a supplier to manufacture sapphire screen covers. However, after the supplier went bankrupt, Apple pumped additional capital of $2 billion to convert the facility into to a Global Command Center, powered entirely by green energy, to store data from iTunes and iCloud, adds the report.At present, Apple has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Apple's shares have underperformed the broader market over the past one year.

Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Steals AI Expert Back From Apple Inc. (AAPL);January 24, 2017, 09:14:30 AM EDT;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe smart home market continues to heat up, andAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL) is determined to stay in the race. After releasing the Google Home AI-powered smart speaker and Google WiFi mesh router system, the company is now turning its attention toNest.Source: NestIn an effort to reboot its pioneering smart home products division, Alphabet has hired back Yoky Matsuoka, an AI and robotics expert who had been working for rivalApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL).makeArticleAd();The former Nest vice president will return as the new Nest CTO.Rebooting the Nest MessNest has had a pioneering role in the smart home. Before being acquired by Google in 2014 for $3.2 billion, the company had helped kick off an entire industry with theNest Learning Thermostat.The smart thermostat delivered on a promise to automate home temperatures, learn homeowners' preferences for different times of the day and to save money on heating and cooling. It did this while being user-friendly; you didn't need to be an engineer or an electrician to install and set it up. It also introduced a chic new look to the lowly thermostat. Nest went on to branch out into smart smoke and CO detectors before being acquired by Google.Things atNest began to go sideways under Google's ownership. TheDropcampurchase involved drama around canceled products and employees quitting over cultural clashes.10 Companies That Are Bringing Jobs Back to     AmericaNest failed to deliver the home security system Google was anxiously awaiting - in fact, the division has failed to releaseanynew products since being acquired (just revisions of existing gear plus those Dropcam cameras). It got mired in a PR disaster after buying theRevolvsmart hub, then shutting it down, effectively bricking devices that had already been bought. The division fell short of Alphabet's revenue targets.The situation culminated with the departure of Nest founder and CEO Tony Fadell.New Nest CTO Is a Familiar FaceNest has been operating under a new CEO since last summer, but Alphabet is clearly trying to kick-start the division. The threat posed byAmazon.com Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AMZN) Alexa-powered Echo smart speaker is very real. Despite being late to the game and lacking a smartphone platform,Amazon has vaulted into a smart home leadership positionwith Alexa able to interact with thousands of products and services.That smart home market is projected to be worth over $121 billion by 2022, so being top dog is a very big deal.Bloomberg is reporting thatAlphabet has hired a key executiveto take on the crucial CTO role at Nest. An AI and robotics expert, Yoky Matsuoka was a co-founder of Google's X research division. She left Google to become a VP with Nest and is credited for the Nest Learning Thermostat's adoptive technology.She jumped ship from Nest after the Google acquisition and last year landed at Apple, where she led teams working on the HealthKit, CareKit and ResearchKit medical health initiatives. Sheleft Apple for unknown reasons in December, but now, the new gig at Google looks like the most probable culprit.According to Bloomberg, Matsuoka becomes Nest's new CTO. Her responsibilities include:Defining a long-term technology roadmap for Nest   products.Identifying advanced technology such as new sensors that   could be incorporated into Nest products.Identifying opportunities for collaboration within   Alphabet.Pursuing partnerships with third-party companies.In other words, Matsuoka will find out where Nest is going, how it can leapfrog the competition, ensuring Nest products integrate with the goals and capabilities of other Alphabet products, and extending Nest's reach as a smart home platform.Apple Inc. (AAPL) Suit Against Qualcomm, Inc.     (QCOM) Is the Real DealWill the new CTO be able to help whip Nest back into shape and get new products out the door? Will she be able to take the spotlight away from Amazon's Echo and Alexa, returning Nest to a position of smart home leadership?She has the credentials, and Alphabet certainly seems to think so.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in   any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace3 Stocks to Watch on Tuesday: Apple Inc.

How Microsoft Has Changed in the Past 3 Years;January 24, 2017, 08:40:00 AM EDT;"Satya Nadella became CEO ofMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) about three years ago, with his formal appointment   coming on Feb. 4, 2014. It was an inspired pick that also   represented a change in tone from previous boss Steve Ballmer.   What wasn't known at the time is just how radically Nadella would   divert from the strategies of his predecessor and founder/CEO   Bill Gates before him.Nadella wasn't another member of the old guard taking over. He   wasn't a Gates disciple who'd been around since the early days of   the company in the mid-1970s, but having started in 1992. He did   have a strong base of knowledge about where the company was and   where it needed to go. When he took over, he made it very clear   that changes were coming and they were going to come quickly.""Microsoft is one of those rare companies to have truly   revolutionized the world through technology, and I couldn't be   more honored to have been chosen to lead the company,"" Nadella   said in apress releaseat the time. ""The opportunity ahead for Microsoft is vast, but to   seize it, we must focus clearly, move faster, and continue to   transform. A big part of my job is to accelerate our ability to   bring innovative products to our customers more quickly.""makeArticleAd();Those remarks would prove prescient, as it's fair to say   Nadella quickly changed how Microsoft does business. It was a   radical remake that turned a still-successful tech dinosaur into   a company built for the future as well as the present.Microsoft has changed dramatically in three years under   Nadella. Image source: Microsoft.How has Microsoft changed?Under Gates and Ballmer, Microsoft operated in a closed   ecosystem. The company wanted people to buy Windows computers, so   it generally kept its products inside that system. There wereApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Mac versions of Office, but even those weren't   updated nearly as often as the Windows versions -- and they only   succeeded because so few options existed.Trying to keep everything in the Windows world backfired on   Microsoft when iOS and Android phones and tablets exploded. Not   having key products such as the various Office programs in the   two major app stores started teaching a generation of younger   folks that there were alternatives.Nadella quickly changed that. In November 2014, he brought the   signature productivity suite to Apple iOS and Android devices. In   addition, the company offered up free versions of programs   including Word, Excel, and PowerPoint that allowed for viewing   documents, as well as some limited editing.These moves, which the new CEO pushed through, also helped   Microsoft change its business model for these programs. Rather   than pushing Office as a one-time sale, the company moved users   toward subscriptions. That was made much easier by Microsoft's   newfound willingness to allow consumers to use Office on whatever   device they wanted, instead of just Windows machines.A different companyIf Microsoft had kept the walls up, it probably would have had   a long future as a steadily shrinking business selling to a core   group of business users. With its new strategy, the company has   been able to introduce Office, Skype, and even Windows to a new   generation while creating a steady flow of subscription revenue.   For example, revenue for Office 365, the name for the   subscription plan, was up nearly 70% in Q2 2016.In addition to opening up the company's products to Apple and   Android products, Nadella has also been a decisive leader. He   made the bold decision to scrap Windows 8 and distance the   company from it by moving right to Windows 10 -- a revamp that   brought back many well-liked features. He was also quick to back   away from the Windows Phone, even if that meant admitting that   the company largely wasted $7.6 billion buyingNokia's devices division.Nadella has also been a strong champion of innovation at his   company. He supported the struggling Surface hybrid, which has   slowly become a strength for Microsoft. In addition, the CEO has   backed HoloLens, a future-looking platform that could help bring   virtual and augmented reality into the mainstream.Microsoft is hip nowCompared with Apple, Microsoft was always square. That's why   the old ""I'm a Mac/I'm a PC"" commercials worked. Now, under   Nadella, Microsoft no longer feels the same. It still may not be   quite as hip as Apple, but the Windows maker has gained some   ground, and its media events now also contain surprises, like the   SurfaceBook laptop.In three years, the new CEO has taken his company from one in   decline to one that has a bright future. Some moves, such as   Microsoft's growing cloud business, can also be credited to   Ballmer, but opening up the company's products to all platforms   has changed the company's trajectory by exponentially opening up   its potential audience.10 stocks we like better than MicrosoftWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Nintendo's Pokemon Go Makes a Late Entry in South Korea;January 24, 2017, 08:25:00 AM EDT;"makeZacksArticleAd();After a six month delay,Nintendo Co LtdNTDOYhas now officially launched its blockbuster hit game, Pokmon Go in South Korea, on both Alphabet'sGOOGLPlay Store and Apple Inc.'sAAPLiOS store.Per media reports, Nintendo's Pokmon Go works with Google Maps, which has ""limited access"" in South Korea. Niantic had earlier sought permission from the South Korean government for access to Korean maps, which was flatly refused. Google had not agreed to South Korean government's demand to ""blur"" sensitive locations like government buildings on Maps.Reportedly, the denial stems from the fact that South Korea remains concerned about its national security. It doesn't share warm ties with its neighbor, North Korea. The simmering border tension between the two nations has led the South Korean government to disallow storage of detailed maps of the country to be stored on any other servers except those in South Korea, add media reports.It remains unknown how Niantic, the firm which developed Pokmon Go, bypassed the Maps issue, add further media reports. Niantic chose to remain silent on this issue during the press conference it held in Seoul on Jan 23, 2017.Nintendo Co. PriceNintendo Co. Price|Nintendo Co. QuoteDennis Hwang, Niantic's design director was quoted saying ""Niantic is a young startup run by a small team. We had not expected that 'Pokemon Go' would receive such explosive popularity worldwide, and needed time to 'take a breath. For a team of our size, it took a lot of time for us to prepare and localize the game for the Korean market, including translating the game's contents into Korean and such.""Developed by Niantic in association with The Pokmon Go company, a subsidiary of Nintendo, Pokmon Go has been a monster hit. Though the success of the game didn't directly benefit Nintendo's financials, we believe that it has strengthened the Japanese video game publisher's position in the lucrative mobile games space. It was created by Niantic in association with Nintendo. Consequently, most of the benefit was netted by Niantic.Over the past one year, the success of Pokmon Go has cushioned its share price, which is up 56.63% compared with the Zacks Toys/Games/ Hobby/Products industry's gain of 14.86%. However, the last few months haven't been pretty good for Nintendo. The launch details of its anticipated console, Switch caused share price to plummet. Even the revival of NES classic, despite a warm reception, suffered a massive inventory problem. Reportedly, Nintendo hasn't been able to supply NES units, which makes it a very hard find, thereby affecting its sales prospects.Over the last three months, Nintendo's shares price has fallen 12.20% compared with the broader industry's decline of 6.82%.At present, Nintendo carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).A better-ranked stock in the wider technology space is Veeva Systems Inc.VEEVwhich sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Intercept Pharmaceuticals Inc (ICPT) Stock Could Be Biotechs Grand Slam;January 24, 2017, 05:44:43 AM EDT;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading     TipsThe market has begun 2017 trading sideways, but don't let that   fool you into thinking there aren't opportunities out there,   especially in biotech. We're in a period of a consolidation,   which means as profits are being taken and forcing stocks lower   in some parts of the market, cash is coming off the sidelines to   buy the dips. Eventually, it will spark the next move higher.As many of you may know by now, I like to make sure my   portfolio is well positioned ahead of that move by investing in   only the best companies out there. One such company - which is   trading at a discount right now - isIntercept Pharmaceuticals Inc(NASDAQ:ICPT).makeArticleAd();I'vetalked about ICPTbefore. It's a biopharmaceutical company focused on treating   progressive non-viral liver diseases, and millions of Americans   suffer from fatty liver disease.7 Straight-A Stocks to Build Your Portfolio       AroundThat sort of market opportunity gives this biotech the   potential to be a grand slam, in my opinion. Fatty liver disease   is when fat accounts for more than5% to 10% of the organ's weight. I think it's the American health crisis of the 21st century,   and it's simply the result of Americans becoming fatter.Intercept's lead product is Ocaliva. It wasgranted accelerated approvalby the Food and Drug Administration in May 2016 for the treatment   of primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), and is the first PBC   therapy that targets the farnesoid X receptor (FXR).The company is also currently evaluating Ocaliva - or   obeticholic acid (OCA) - for potential uses across a variety of   additional chronic liver diseases, including nonalcoholic   steatohepatitis (NASH), primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) and   biliary atresia. Intercept owns the worldwide rights to OCA   outside of Japan, China and Korea.Now I will add the caveat that this biotech stock is a   higher-risk idea. It's likely gotten ahead of itself over the   years, but the fact that the shares rallied to $460 in 2014   underscores the ultimate potential here.Apple Inc. (AAPL) Suit Against Qualcomm, Inc.       (QCOM) Is the Real DealSure, there will be competition. And there have definitely   been some execution issues. However, I think the company will   clear those hurdles in time with three applications (PBC, PSC and   NASH) currently in or beyond Phase II and III FDA trials.The stock is currently in a double-bottom formation, and a   bounce through $125 could lift ICPT up toward $175 in the next   year. Over the very long term, and certainly with some bumps   along the way, I still think this could be a $400 stock.Curious what Wall Street insider Charles Payne really       thinks?Get more behind-the-scenes insights, valuable market     research and hands-on guidance including live stock     recommendations from Fox Business's rising star.

Apple, Inc. Had to Get In Bed With Qualcomm Because of Verizon;January 23, 2017, 08:45:00 PM EDT;"Image source: Apple.In the iPhone's early years,Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) bought baseband modems from Infineon, which was   later acquired byIntel. The original iPhone launched as anAT&Texclusive, and AT&T's 3G network is built on GSM. The Mac   maker was still paying licensing fees toQualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM) , as all cellphone makers around the world must,   starting in 2007 with the original iPhone.makeArticleAd();But things got a lot more complicated in 2011, which is when   Apple and Qualcomm really took their relationship to the next   level. It's because ofVerizon(NYSE: VZ) .It all started because of Big RedThat was the year that Applefinally launchedthe iPhone on Big Red's network, ending Ma Bell's exclusivity   that was costing Verizon subscribers; the iPhone was a powerful   exclusive device that compelled many subscribers to switch. From   Apple's perspective, Verizon is the largest carrier in the U.S.,   so of course it wanted access to that subscriber base. Even   though Verizon's 3G network uses CDMA, the cellular technology   that Qualcomm helped pioneer, and CDMA is less common in other   parts of the world, Apple still recognized that it should offer   more variants of the iPhone in order to expand its addressable   markets worldwide.It's worth noting here that China, which became the world's   largest smartphone market the following year in 2012, also uses   CDMA or variants of CDMA for 3G wireless service.Here's an excerpt from Apple's complaint (emphasis added):Apple has been indirectly paying Qualcomm licensing fees     since 2007, when it released the iPhone.Apple became even more reliant on Qualcomm in 2011 due     to Apple's desire to release an iPhone that could connect to     CDMA networks, such as Verizon's.For many years, Qualcomm ensured that it was the only possible     supplier of CDMA chipsets, and it remains so today for the     chipsets used in Apple's flagship iPhone product line. As a     monopoly supplier of an essential input, Qualcomm had the power     to constrict and disrupt chipset supply, which (coupled with     Qualcomm's refusal to enter into industry-standard supply     agreements that would have guaranteed supply to Apple, absent     unusual or unforeseen circumstances) would have been disastrous     to Apple's business.Considering Qualcomm's dominance in CDMA, both in terms of its   patent portfolio as well as baseband chips, Apple had no choice   but to get in bed with the mobile chip giant. For years, it   seemed as if the pair had a strong and mutually beneficial   relationship evidenced by ongoing exclusivity. But what we now   know is that behind the scenes, Apple was incredibly unhappy but   also contractually obligated to keep quiet. The Mac maker now   says that it was continuously forced into ""undesirable,   one-sided, and unreasonable contract terms.""Ultimately, it was still probably worth it, considering the   iPhone's multiyear growth run that only just ended in 2016. That   growth was fueled by both tapping the largest U.S. carrier as   well as expanding internationally, including in China.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

The 3 Stocks Most Hedge Funds Own;January 23, 2017, 07:07:00 PM EDT;"Many hedge funds delivered disappointing returns last year.   The Eurekahedge Hedge Fund Index, which tracks the top hedge   funds in the market, rose just 4.4% in 2016 -- underperforming   the  S&P 500's 11.2% gain.The performance of individual funds varied greatly, but top   investors likeWarren Buffettnoted that the market was saturated with too many hedge funds,   and that their high fees made them poorer investments   than basic index funds.makeArticleAd();Image source: Getty Images.Nonetheless, investors still like to see what the ""big boys""   own, and  BarclayHedge's third quarter report on hedge fund   holdings reveals three well-known tech stocks are at the top of   their shopping lists --Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) ,Facebook(NASDAQ: FB) , andAmazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) .AppleForty-five of the top hedge funds owned Apple during the third   quarter. That might seem surprising since the tech giant's   iPhone, iPad, and Mac sales all  declined annually last   quarter, and analysts expect its revenue and earnings to   respectively rise just 6% and 8% this year.But despite those speed bumps, Apple still generated $52.3   billion in free cash flow over the past 12 months, held $20.5   billion in domestic cash at the end of 2016, and stashes over   $200 billion overseas. This means that Apple could easily   diversify away from its core hardware products by buying up more   companies or investing in new projects.Over the past 12 months, Apple repurchased $29.2 billion in   shares and paid out $12.2 billion in dividends. That equals a   yield of just 1.9%, but its payout ratio of 26% means that it   could boost that payout to attract income investors. Apple's P/E   of 14, which is lower than the industry average of 17, also makes   it a safe value play in a volatile market.FacebookForty-three of the top hedge funds owned Facebook during the   quarter. Facebook is a great growth play because it's the   800-pound gorilla of the social networking market and is   disruptingAlphabet's business of traditional display ads.Last quarter, Facebook's monthly active users (MAUs) rose    16% annually to 1.79 billion and its revenue surged 56% to   $7.01 billion. Advertising accounted for 97% of its top line, and   84% of that came from mobile platforms. Its net income also   surged 166% to $2.38 billion. With those robust growth figures in   mind, Facebook's trailing P/E of 61 -- which is higher than the   industry average of 50 -- doesn't look terribly expensive.   Looking ahead, analysts expect its revenue and earnings to   respectively rise another 52% and 80% this year.Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Image source: Facebook.But Facebook isn't resting on its laurels. It's still   expanding into adjacent markets like virtual reality with Oculus   and 360-degree videos, machine learning with a dedicated AI unit   (FAIR), and even solar-powered drones for beaming internet   connections to rural and low income regions. Those moves could   all help Facebook grow beyond its core social networking and   advertising business.Amazon.comForty-one of the top hedge funds owned Amazon, which dominates   the e-commerce and cloud infrastructure markets. Over the past   few years, Amazon expanded its e-commerce ecosystem with Prime,   which locks in customers with free shipping, discounts, and   digital perks. It's further expanded that ecosystem into homes   with devices like the Kindle, Fire TV, Echo, Dash, andDRS-enabled appliances.That's a low-margin business, but the higher profitability of   AWS (Amazon Web Services) -- the biggest cloud platform in the   world -- offsets those losses. Last quarter, AWS' operating   income more than doubled annually to  $861 million, which   offset an operating loss at its international marketplace unit   and boosted its total net income by 219% to $252 million.   Analysts expect Amazon's earnings to grow 282% this year and 85%   next year.That's why analysts currently expect Amazon's revenue and   earnings to respectively grow 28% and 282% this year. Based on   those growth estimates, Amazon's trailing P/E of 185 and forward   P/E of 93 don't look that pricey.The key takeawayHedge funds often buy the same stocks because they're safe   picks. They're more likely to buy Apple, Facebook, and Amazon   instead of lesser-known small cap stocks with higher growth   potential. That herd-like mentality is common on Wall Street, but   I believe that these three stocks are still solid core holdings   for any tech investor.Find out why Amazon.comis one of the 10 best stocks to buy nowMotley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent     more than a decade beating the market.

Welcome Back, Apple TV Speculation;January 23, 2017, 05:09:00 PM EDT;"Not this Apple TV. Image source: Apple.Hello there, old friend. Gosh, how long has it been? It must   bealmost two yearsby now.makeArticleAd();Speculating onApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) building a TV set used to be a favorite pastime   among investors and analysts. Sadly, the company reportedly   abandoned those plans a few years ago, after spending nearly a   decade contemplating and researching the idea. Well, the   speculation is back with a vengeance. TheWall Street JournalandNikkei Asian Revieware reporting that Apple's dominant manufacturing partner   Foxconn is thinking about investing in a massive $7 billion U.S.   factory that would create some 30,000 to 50,000 domestic   jobs.What's sparking the speculation is that Foxconn Chairman Terry   Gou told reporters yesterday that the facility would be producing   ""larger display panels."" Apple would be investing jointly in the   facility. The logistics costs for shipping large display panels   is much higher, so it makes a little bit more sense to   manufacture them in the U.S. It's not clear how large of panels   we're talking about.Cue the rumor mongersApple has already confirmed that it is exiting the standalone   display market. The company finally discontinued the aging   Thunderbolt Display last year, and instead of updating or   launching a new model Apple chose to collaborate withLG Electronicsto design a couple 4K and 5K UltraFine displays that complement   the new MacBook Pros.Beyond MacBooks, the only other Apple products that have   relatively large displays are iMacs, which come in 21.5-inch 4K   and 27-inch 5K display sizes. Back in 2012, Apple made a push   with U.S. manufacturing for both the iMac and Mac Pro. A portion   of iMac production was relocated to the U.S. at the time. In the   years since, it's unclear if Apple has continued domestic   production of its flagship all-in-one; it's possible that the   company quietly shifted iMac manufacturing back to China. The Mac   Pro is still assembled stateside in Austin, Texas, although Apple   wouldprefer to shiftthat manufacturing back abroad too if it weren't for the current   political climate.The point here is that there are no other Apple products that   would need a domestic supply of large panel displays, so the   market, as it likes to do, has starting dreaming.Two years later, it still doesn't make senseHere's the thing: Apple can accomplish most of its TV   ambitions without making a full TV set. That's essentially why   Apple chose not to pursue a TV set a couple years ago, since the   TV business is not a particularly attractive business in general;   margins are razor-thin, commoditization occurs rapidly, inventory   risk is significant, and pricing power is virtually nonexistent   (a function of commoditization).There's little upside or potential for differentiation that   can be realized through deeper integration with TV hardware,   mostly since Apple can still innovate on the interface level with   software through its existing set-top box Apple TV. It can -- and   reportedly has tried -- also try to introduce TV services like   slimmer over-the-top cable packages without getting too involved   on the hardware side.I don't know what Apple's up to, but I doubt that it's   resurrecting its TV ambitions.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Energous Corp (WATT) Stock Bombs After Brutal Report;January 23, 2017, 04:41:15 PM EDT;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading     TipsEnergous Corp(NASDAQ:WATT) stock is only for the crazy ones, as it continues a   roller-coaster movement that has seen the stock edge out a gain   of 5.1% this year. Today, WATT stock is getting hammered, albeit   gently, for a stock that traders usually swing violently by the   hind legs.Shares of Energous were chugging along with the rest of the   broader market, when suddenly WATT stock took a turn for the   worst, dropping more than 5% in the span of minutes. The unlikely   culprit? A report published onSeeking Alphaentitled""Energous Corporation: Game Over.""makeArticleAd();Certainly, opinionated news like that can't budge a behemoth   likeApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL), but for the $338 million Energous, any news is a vine for   stock traders to swing on.But Seeking Alpha's report is a doozy, alleging that Energous   is in way over its head and WATT stockholders are equally   clueless:""Nonetheless, logic and facts have thus far failed to   influence a retail investor base suffering from the most extreme   cognitive dissonance we have witnessed since Uni-Pixel or OCZ   Technology Group. The WATT bull case has eschewed substance, and   instead focused on the ""tea leaves"" of an Apple iPhone 8 wireless   charging design win.""It wasn't long ago that WATT stock saw a huge surge based on a   speculated partnership with Apple Inc., which SA believes to be   the only bull case for Energous - ""an iPhone 8 wireless charging   design win.""10 Stocks to Buy to Survive a ""Trumpsy-Turvy""       2017However, Apple's latest patent filing are at odds with this.   In its more than 16 patent applications for wireless charging, SA   notes that Apple is focused on inductive charging, not the   RF-based technology used by Energous:""This novel approach would eliminate today's wireless charging   pads that require devices maintain specific points of contact and   orientation. Apple diagrams clearly illustrate how iPhones and   iPads will elegantly turn an entire surface into an inductive   charging platform.""Energous' charging is slightly different, allowing for   wire-free charging through the air on any number of devices in   the room. The tech in question is also a regulatory hurdle that   WATT has yet to pass, as it hasn't been shown to not be a health   detriment.At any rate, SA's report rightly concludes that Apple is   rarely a first-mover, and that its inductive tech, while in the   works for some time, is likely to be revealed alongside the   iPhone 8.IDTI,a supplier of inductive wireless charging chips for Apple's   Watch andSamsung Electronics(OTCMKTS:SSNLF), has previously mentioned Apple's intent to use its own tech   for iPhone wireless charging.The harshest reality, however, is Apple's dismissal of WATT's   technology as ""inefficient"" and a health hazard (due to radiation   no less) in a 2013 patent application for desktop wireless   charging.Free Profits in Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock       After EarningsEnergous stock was down 4.01% as of the close  but I'd   expect the WATT stock bulls to continue undeterred for the most   part.$WATTtook this pic a few years ago, how I feel today haha.

Apple, Inc.'s Lawsuit Is a Fundamental Threat to Qualcomm's Entire Business Model;January 23, 2017, 02:13:00 PM EDT;"Image source: Apple.There's really no way to overstate how importantApple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) unprecedented lawsuit againstQualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM) is. It's not an exaggeration to say that the   complaint, which was filed last Friday evening, represents a   fundamental threat to Qualcomm's entire business model. It makes   sense then that Qualcomm shares have gotten absolutely crushed   today, down by as much as 14% in the morning.makeArticleAd();For starters,Apple's suit has more teeththan the regulators'. Qualcomm has been able to negotiate and   settle other antitrust complaints from regulatory agencies all   around the world, mostly behind closed doors. This usually   entails paying a fine and/or agreeing to reform some of its   business practices. On the other hand, Apple is unlikely to go   away so quietly, especially as the Mac maker feels as if it has   been coerced into silence all these years while paying what it   considers to be ""extortion-level"" royalties. While possible, I   don't think Apple has any interest in settling this suit quietly,   and the outcome of the case will affect Qualcomm's other   customers.This is why Apple's case is so much bigger, despite the fact   that the immediate financial implications are comparable. Apple   is initially seeking $1 billion that it is already owed, which   isn't too much larger than the regulatory fines that Qualcomm has   been paying. Qualcomm paid $975 million in 2015 to settle with   China's National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), and   South Korea's Fair Trade Commission fined Qualcomm $853 million   just a few weeks ago.Combined with Samsung, Apple and its suppliers represented 40%   of all of Qualcomm's revenue last fiscal year. That's actually   down from the 49% of sales that the companies collectively   represented in fiscal 2014.Data source: SEC filings. Chart by author. Fiscal years   shown.Being sued by your biggest customer is never a good thing, but   having your biggest customer allege that your entire business   model is flawed is about as bad as it gets.""Double-dipping""Qualcomm sells chips while also simultaneously licensing its   patent portfolio and collecting royalty revenue. Apple believes   that this is an illegal form of ""double-dipping"" where Qualcomm   is able to get paid twice. In patent law, the ""patent exhaustion""   doctrine, which is also known as the ""first sale"" doctrine,   states that a purchaser of a product that uses patented   technology automatically receives a license to use or   subsequently resell that product, and the patent holder should   not be able to pursue downstream customers or companies for   additional royalties, since they've already been paid based on   the first sale.Yet this is precisely what Qualcomm does: It sells chips to   Apple contract manufacturers that are used in iPhones, while   separately requiring licensing deals from those same suppliers.   Qualcomm gets paid twice, even though when it sells chips it   should be automatically conferring the rights automatically. The   licensing business isincredibly profitable, with an earnings-before-tax (EBT) margin of 85%. The chip   business has an EBT margin of just 12%. If the court agrees with   Apple, Qualcomm's licensing business has a lot of potential   downside.But at what cost?The royalties that Qualcomm charges are also based as a   percentage of the final sales price, another practice that Apple   argues is inappropriate. Another concept in patent law is that   royalties should be based upon the ""smallest salable unit,""   instead of based on the entire product's value. As Apple points   out in its suit, modern smartphones have become increasingly   advanced over the years with more and more features. The cellular   connectivity that Qualcomm's patents facilitate are a shrinking   portion of the total product's value. It makes no sense that   Qualcomm should collect more when customers pay extra for a   larger display or more storage, but that's exactly what Qualcomm   does even though those functions are entirely unrelated to   cellular connectivity.Simply put, Apple wants to pay royalties based on the chips it   buys, which it argues are the ""smallest salable unit."" Apple pays   about $10 to $20 per baseband processor. The percentages that   Qualcomm charges are rather high, too. While the company   typically negotiates each licensing deal separately, its 2015   agreement with the NDRC sheds some light. From the most recent   10-K (emphasis added):In February 2015, we reached a resolution with the National     Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) in China regarding its     investigation and agreed to implement a rectification plan that     modifies certain of our business practices in China. The     rectification plan provides, among other things, that for     licenses of only our 3G and 4G essential Chinese patents for     branded devices sold for use in China starting on January 1,     2015 (and reported to us in the third quarter of fiscal 2015),we will charge running royalties at royalty rates of 5%     for 3G CDMA or WCDMA devices (including multimode 3G/4G     devices) and 3.5% for 4G devices that do not implement CDMA or     WCDMA (including 3-mode LTE-TDD devices), in each case using a     royalty base of 65% of the net selling price.Analysts estimate that Apple has been paying Qualcomm roughly   $15 per iPhone in royalties, probably net of the ""rebates"" that   Qualcomm provides in exchange for exclusivity. Using the terms of   the NDRC agreement would imply a royalty about $21 on a $650   iPhone (which is a multimode 3G/4G device). Qualcomm actually   offered Apple comparable terms. But Apple, beingno stranger to patent litigationand licensing, balked at the terms. From Apple's complaint   (emphasis added):In 2015, Qualcomm made an ""offer"" to Apple to license     Qualcomm's Chinese 3G/4G declared-essential patents on terms     purportedly ""consistent"" with those that resolved an inquiry by     Chinese regulators into Qualcomm's licensing practices,     called the ""National Development and Reform Commission     resolution"" (""NDRC resolution"" or ""rectification plan"" for     short).Apple immediately rejected the proposalbecause it was not [fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory],     was excessive as compared to other licenses to cellular     [standard-essential patents] Apple negotiated at arm's length,     and was of limited value to resolving the parties' worldwide     licensing dispute.Since Qualcomm has also been allegedly been tying chip sales   to licensing deals, while also pricing chips above competitive   prices, the chip business is also threatened by all of this. In   no uncertain terms, this lawsuit is a massive deal with major   implications on Qualcomm's business.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Qualcomm Stock Tumbles Following Apple Lawsuit;January 23, 2017, 12:38:00 PM EDT;"Image source: Getty Images.What happenedShares of mobile chip giantQualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM) fell sharply on Monday as analysts downgraded the   stock following news thatApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) was suing the company. This lawsuit came just a   few days after the Federal Trade Commission formally charged   Qualcomm over anti-competitive behavior. Qualcomm stock was down   about 13% at 11:15 a.m. EST.So whatOn Friday of last week, Apple accused Qualcomm of unfairly   charging excessive royalties for its technology. Furthermore,   Apple alleged that Qualcomm withheld $1 billion in payments as   retaliation for Apple's cooperation with agencies investigating   the company.makeArticleAd();Just a few days earlier, the FTC filed a complaint in federal   district court charging Qualcomm with ""using anti-competitive   tactics to maintain its monopoly in the supply of a key   semiconductor device used in cellphones and other consumer   products."" Specifically, the FTC alleges that Qualcomm uses a ""no   license, no chips"" policy, refuses to license standard-essential   patents to competitors, and extracted exclusivity from Apple in   exchange for reduced patent royalties in an effort to prevent   Apple from working with its competitors.Two analyst downgrades came on Monday following these   developments. Nomura analyst Romit Shah downgraded Qualcomm stock   to ""neutral"" due to the unexpected breadth of the lawsuits and   the subsequent uncertainty surrounding Qualcomm's acquisition ofNXP Semiconductors. CLSA also downgraded the stock to ""underperform.""Now whatQualcomm derives the bulk of its profits from its licensing   business, which makes these two lawsuits particularly dangerous   for the company. Both are an attack on Qualcomm's extremely   lucrative business model, which could be upended in the   worst-case scenario.Qualcomm has disputed the FTC complaint, saying that it's   based on a flawed legal theory, a lack of economic support, and   significant misconceptions about the mobile technology industry.   Qualcomm also dismissed the claims in Apple's lawsuit as   baseless. These lawsuits will take time to play out, and changes   to the FTC under the Trump administration could complicate things   further. Investors are taking the threats seriously, though,   erasing the gains made by shares of Qualcomm during the second   half of 2016.10 stocks we like better than QualcommWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

The Pain Is Only the Beginning for Qualcomm, Inc. (QCOM) Stock;January 23, 2017, 12:20:45 PM EDT;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsQualcomm, Inc.(NASDAQ:QCOM) fell 13% in early trade on Monday afterApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL), its largest customer, dropped a large legal bomb on it this past Friday.Source: ShutterstockThe lawsuit, filed in southern California late on Jan. 20, alleges that Qualcomm withheld $1 billion in rebates in retaliation for Apple cooperating with Korean efforts to openthe radio chip market.makeArticleAd();The lawsuit follows a Federal Trade Commission (FTC) suit charging Qualcomm with cutting its prices to Apple in exchange for exclusivity, thenusing that dealagainst other cell phone companies.The suits are direct assaults on Qualcomm's business model, which is to license patents essential for getting into the mobile phone business and use those agreements to create a virtual monopoly in the chips needed for the phones to work.Governments Weigh InIn December, for instance, Korean regulatorsfined Qualcomm $864 millionover its patent licensing practices.Korea acted afterSamsung Electronics Co. Ltd.(OTCMKTS:SSNLF), a major chip supplier, backed down in its ongoing dispute with Qualcomm, which has tied its patent rights to its production of chips for decades. Samsung returned to Qualcomm as a supplier of modem chips for the Galaxy 7 after making its own chips for the Galaxy 6.3 Bullish Stock Charts That Scream ""Buy     Me!""Earlier, China had gotten Qualcomm to accept a$975 million fineand to adjust business practices after a multi-year dispute concerning its licensing practices.At the time, investors took this to be an all-clear concerning Qualcomm's business practices, with the stock rising almost 20% in a month and hitting a high of $70 in November, when Qualcomm announced net income of $1.6 billion on revenues of $6.184 billion, meaning $1 in each $4 brought into the company was reaching the net income line. Those margins had been under pressure in 2015, during the worst of the company's fight with China.Early this month it seemed the China deal was opening up vast new markets for Qualcomm, after it signedpatent deals with other Chinese cellphone makers, most recently withMeizu and Gionee.Now it would seem that the China agreement meant Qualcomm's legal problems were just starting, which is why QCOM stock is under pressure.Monopoly Rights ThreatenedIn addition to the Apple and Korean actions, European regulators have their own charges pending, claiming that Qualcomm is using patents essential to industry standards to maintain an illegal monopoly over the production and sale of the required chips.Those charges couldimperilQualcomm'spending purchaseofNXP Semiconductors NV(NASDAQ:NXPI), a Dutch company, announced in late October at a price then described as being $110/share. As of today, NXPI was trading at $96.31/share.What's of greatest concern in the Apple suit is that Qualcomm was Apple's sole chip supplier until last year, whenIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) got contracts to supply half those needed for the iPhone 7. It was after that action that, Apple alleges, Qualcomm took actions against it; actions it now says were illegal.While Qualcomm does make substantial profits from making and selling its Snapdragon line of modem chips, most of its profits come from licensing basic technologies essential to entry into the business, such as 3G and 4G, to phone makers.Standards Essential Patents (SEPs), patents that are essential to a market operating are supposed to be licensed under what are calledFair, Reasonable and Non-Discriminatoryterms (FRAND). But what is fair, what is reasonable and what is non-discriminatory can be subject to dispute, and that's what the war with Qualcomm is about.United Continental Holdings Inc (UAL) Stock     Could Fake Us All OutWith governments weighing-in alongside its biggest customer, a deal that Qualcomm thought meant the end of its legal troubles may turn out to have been just the beginning of them. Thus, the stock is falling. Qualcomm's existence as a major supplier is not threatened, but its monopoly profits may be.Dana   Blankenhornis a financial and technology journalist.

The $1 Billion Question: Did Apple, Inc. Rat Out Qualcomm to the Feds?;January 23, 2017, 12:00:00 PM EDT;"Image source: Apple.There's a lot going on inApple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) lawsuit againstQualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM) . One of the main things that Apple is seeking is   nearly $1 billion that it says Qualcomm owes. Apple has been   paying what it considers inflated royalties for years, which are   passed along in full from its contract manufacturers that have   inked licensing deals with Qualcomm. Qualcomm is supposed to   license its patents at fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory   (FRAND) rates.makeArticleAd();The two companies had previously reached a Business   Cooperation and Patent Agreement (BCPA), which includes quarterly   payments to Apple in exchange for other concessions, the most   important being exclusivity in supplying baseband processors to   Apple. But these payments are also contingent on Apple mostly   keeping quiet about the two companies' business arrangements, a   provision that Apple believes is intended to hide Qualcomm's   alleged anticompetitive behavior. However, the terms of the BCPA   were never meant to preclude Apple from cooperating with   government regulators if asked. At the heart of the issue is   whether or not regulators approached Apple first, or if Apple   voluntarily ratted Qualcomm out to the Feds.Apple said, Qualcomm saidIn Apple's complaint, it argues that Qualcomm intentionally   tries to hide its behavior from regulators (emphasis in second   paragraph added):Preventing Apple from bringing its concerns to law       enforcement.As a condition of even partial relief from its non-FRAND     royalties, Qualcomm sought to gag Apple and prevent     it from bringing its concerns to law enforcement     or challenging Qualcomm's compliance with FRAND     commitments.As described above, through the second paragraph of Section     7 of the BCPA, Qualcomm conditioned royalty relief on a     provision thatrestricted Apple from initiating or inducing     certain legal actionsin three particular identified areas: (a) assertion of     patents against Qualcomm; (b) claims that Qualcomm failed to     offer a license to its [standards-essential patents] on     FRAND terms; and (c) claims that Qualcomm's patent rights     were exhausted....The BCPA carved out, as it must, an acknowledgment that     Apple has a responsibility to respond to enforcement     agencies' requests for information. But in restraining Apple     from initiating action or bringing concerns to law     enforcement, Qualcomm conditioned billions of dollars on     Apple's silence before courts and regulators about Qualcomm's     business practices.That bit on ""initiating or inducing"" is a key piece here. If   Apple was the one initiating the regulatory investigation, then   it could be in breach of the BCPA terms, and as such Qualcomm   would be able to withhold payment. But Apple maintains that it   did no such thing:Apple has provided information and presentations only     at the requests of the agencies. Apple has not ""induced""     any agency or any other third party to take action against     Qualcomm on grounds that Qualcomm's licensing practices     violated the FRAND promise or that Qualcomm's patents were     exhausted.Apple has complied with all other conditions and     requirements of the BCPA.Naturally, Qualcomm's perspective is different. The mobile   chip giant issued a briefpress releaseto comment on Apple's complaint last week. Here's what Qualcomm   general counsel Don Rosenberg had to say (emphasis added):Apple has intentionally mischaracterized our agreements and     negotiations, as well as the enormity and value of the     technology we have invented, contributed and shared with all     mobile device makers through our licensing program.Apple has been actively encouraging regulatory     attackson Qualcomm's business in various jurisdictions around the     world, as reflected in the recent [Korea Fair Trade Commission]     decision and FTC complaint, by misrepresenting facts and     withholding information.Qualcomm's response suggests that Apple has been more active   in ""inducing"" regulatory actions against Qualcomm. Furthermore,   Qualcomm thinks Apple is misrepresenting the pair's relationship   and business dealings. The Mac maker is looking for a wide range   of concessions, but that $1 billion seems to be hanging in the   balance of whether or not Apple instigated regulatory action, or   if it was merely cooperating with regulators as required by   law.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

3 Big Stock Charts for Monday: Qualcomm, Inc. (QCOM), Walt Disney Co (DIS) and Adobe Systems Incorporated (ADBE);January 23, 2017, 11:04:43 AM EDT;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading     TipsToday's three big stock charts look at names that are   making big moves on their charts. Shares ofWalt Disney Co(NYSE:DIS) make the list for their recent rally that has left the market   behind, whileAdobe Systems Incorporated(NASDAQ:ADBE) is finally back to breaking into new relative high territory.   Finally, in the news of the day category, shares ofQualcomm, Inc.(NASDAQ:QCOM) are trading more than 14% lower and taking out all kinds   of chart support worthy of reviewing.Walt Disney Co (DIS)makeArticleAd();Disney shares appear to be reloading for another rally as the   stock has consolidated once again to its short-term 20-day moving   average. This is the third time that DIS stock has seen this   type of action since the rally started in December. Now, more   than 16% higher, momentum is suggesting that the short-term   pullback in Disney is likely just another buying opportunity.Momentum on DIS shares has been building with   intermediate-term support underneath the rally, suggesting that   if the selling were to increase, it would be contained at two   important levels.First, the stock's 50-day moving average, which is trending   higher and currently at the $102.50-level.  Second, this is   the same area that Disney's lower Bollinger Band resides,   suggesting that we would see more buyers some into the market   around this price point.10 Blue-Chip Stocks That Could Be Holding You       BackSignificant chart support builds in this area starting at   $103, telling us that this intermediate-term bull likely has a   long road to run as soon as this consolidation is finished.Adobe Systems Incorporated (ADBE)Here goes Adobe again! The software provider took a break from   its rally to consolidate at the $108-level and get traction to   make its newest run to break above $111. ADBE shares are   opening trading this morning in this new high territory and will   grab the attention of traders in doing so.The catch, Adobe's RSI reading is now hitting an overbought   indication that could have some profit takers enter the market   and begin to sell, but there is something we like about the   timing of this signal.ADBE will not drop their latest earnings news on the market   until March 16, much later in the season than most of the   technical companies. This offers the opportunity for Adobe stock   to benefit from what has been a positive season so far, while   trading with less volatility.For now, we expect to see a small pullback after the break   above $111; however, this should be met by fast and aggressive   buying as the 50-day moving average for ADBE has just turned back   into a bullish trend, which suggests that higher prices are   likely as this trend grows stronger.Qualcomm, Inc. (QCOM)Qualcomm shares are trading more than 14% lower this morning   after news that the company is being sued byApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) and several downgrades have traders running to the hills.   QCOM stock has sliced throughallof its short-term trading support trendlines and is already   breaking into a bear market trading pattern with the move below   more significant support.3 Reasons Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Will Keep       Delivering in 2017The significant support comes in the form of Qualcomm shares'   20-month moving average, a trendline that is currently positioned   at the $57.50-level. The long-term traders will be eyeing this   number over the next week or so, as a break below this on a   closing basis will draw even more QCOM sellers into the   group.As if the company needed more pressure. All but one of the   analysts covering Qualcomm stock have it ranked a buy or strong   buy. This tells us that there are likely to be a lot more   downgrades coming forward on QCOM stock over the near-term, which   will add yet more selling pressure to the stock.For now, the stock remains a sell and not worthy of losing a   finger by trying to catch this falling knife.As of this writing, Johnson Research Group did not hold a     position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 Stocks to Buy for Donald Trump's Second       Wind10 Dividend Growth Stocks That Simply Print       MoneyThe post3 Big Stock Charts for Monday: Qualcomm, Inc.

Why Apple's Lawsuit Against Qualcomm Has More Teeth Than the FTC's;January 23, 2017, 11:00:00 AM EDT;"Last week, mobile chip giantQualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM) found itself on the receiving end of not one, but   two antitrust complaints:one from the Federal Trade Commission(FTC), followed shortly thereafter by one fromApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) . That sounds like a powerful double whammy of   litigation, but the FTC's complaint may not actually have all   that much staying power due to the recent presidential   administration change.Apple's complaint, on the other hand, carries no such   concerns.The Trump factorThe FTC's complaint was initiated following a 2-1 vote. There   are typically five commissioners that are nominated by the   president and must be confirmed by the Senate. They serve   staggered terms that last seven years, and there can not be more   than three commissioners from the same political party. There are   currently two vacancies, but there are about to be three.   Chairwoman Edith Ramirez, a Democrat that was appointed by   President Obama in 2010, has announced her resignation effective   next month.makeArticleAd();FTC Chairwoman Edith Ramirez resigns next month. Image     source: FTC.gov.Of the two remaining commissioners, Maureen Ohlhausen   (Republican) and Terrell McSweeny (Democrat), Ohlhausen was the   dissenting opinion that voted against the suit. Ohlhausen even   took the rare move of issuing adissenting statement(link opens PDF), believing that ""the complaint fails to allege   that Qualcomm charges more than a reasonable royalty."" The   commissioner says that she has ""been presented with no robust   economic evidence of exclusion and anticompetitive effects.""President Trump has tapped former FTC commissioner Joshua   Wright to advise on the FTC transition, and Trump is expected to   bring back a Republican majority to the FTC for the first time in   nearly a decade, along with a lighter regulatory stance. Despite   Trump's anti-establishment rhetoric throughout the campaign,   which at face value would suggest that he'd nominate outsiders,   Trump's recent nominations for other agency positions are   decidedly from the Republican establishment (including   Wright).The new commissioners will be inheriting a complaint that they   are unlikely to feel strongly about. As such, it's quite possible   that Qualcomm can settle the lawsuit relatively quickly and on   more favorable terms.Apple is done being quietIn contrast, Apple's suit is unaffected by such political   matters. This lawsuit isn't likely to go away anytime soon, and   the new administration has no direct bearing on the damages that   Apple is seeking. Unlike regulatory suits, which often end in   fines and other types of negotiated concessions, Apple is seeking   nearly $1 billion that it says it is owed from Qualcomm, which   Qualcomm has been withholding in retaliation for the Mac maker   cooperating with South Korean antitrust regulators.Image source: Apple.Apple also wants the court to help it obtain a direct license   for Qualcomm's patents at more favorable terms. Apple is seeking   disgorged royalties that it says have been ""extortion-level,"" and   wants to legally prohibit Qualcomm from voluntarily interrupting   Apple's supply of baseband processors. More broadly, Apple is   effectively asking for help in restructuring the royalties that   it has to pay, arguing that Qualcomm's current practice of   setting royalty rates as a percentage of the final product's   sales price is inappropriate.Simply put, Apple's case has more teeth than the FTC's because   it's here to stay, and the outcome has the potential to   significantly alter how Qualcomm does business with smartphone   makers and competing baseband suppliers alike, especially if this   all plays out publicly. It sounds like Apple's relationship with   Qualcomm has been deteriorating for years, and considering the   extent of what Apple is seeking in the way of damages, it seems   unlikely that Apple and Qualcomm will simply kiss and make   up.It's still possible that it will get settled behind closed   doors, and we're all familiar with Apple's penchant for secrecy.   But Apple's rare move of suing one of its most important   suppliers was intended to bring some of these practices to light,   practices that Qualcomm has allegedly obfuscated for a decade   with a sprawling web of confidentiality agreements.Apple feels like it has been forcefully silenced all these   years from speaking out against alleged anticompetitive behavior   -- this suit seems predicated partially on principle. Apple has   been quietly fighting Qualcomm for years, and it wants to be loud   now. Settling wouldn't just feel like a financial compromise, but   a moral one, too.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Apple Inc. (AAPL) Suit Against Qualcomm, Inc. (QCOM) Is the Real Deal;January 23, 2017, 10:58:12 AM EDT;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) dropped a bombshell on one of its biggest partners,Qualcomm, Inc.(NASDAQ:QCOM) last Friday. Apple filed a complaint in U.S. District Court seeking $1 billion for monopolistic behavior. AAPL stock holders likely won't be impressed with the flimsy amount - after all, Apple brought in more than $215 billion in revenues last year.Source: ShutterstockBut the litigation could have a material impact on Apple stock over the long haul.makeArticleAd();At the heart of the suit is Qualcomm's baseband chips, which allow smartphones to connect to mobile networks. Without this core technology, you actually wouldn't be able to do much with your device. QCOM has protected this technology with an extensive set of patents, and has established global standards for the mobile industry.While AAPL stock saw little initial reaction - it was up less than 1% on the news. But QCOM saw action, with shares down a grueling 10%.Qualcomm is the target of various governmental lawsuits regarding anti-competitive behavior and unreasonable royalties. Justlast week, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission filed a suit (though this may ultimately be undone by the Trump administration). Then there was a similar action brought by the European Union, as well as a fine of $975 million from the Chinese government.7 Straight-A Stocks to Build Your Portfolio     AroundBut the suit that has gotten most of the attention - and that's at the heart of Apple's own actions - is from the Korea Fair Trade Commission, which has levied a penalty of $865 million. QCOM is vigorously pushing back, claiming that its technologies are top-notch and the financial terms are within industry norms.AAPL thinks this is laughable.Apple says that Qualcomm is withholding rebates withholding rebates because of its cooperation with Korean authorities. AAPL also is alleging that it was coerced into buying QCOM chips, on an exclusive basis, to get relief on some royalties. This arrangement lasted from 2011 to 2016.But for the most part, the real issue for Apple is that Qualcomm's royalties are steep, coming to as much as 5% of the average price of an iPhone. By comparison, typical chip operators likeTexas Instruments Incorporated(NASDAQ:TXN) andBroadcom Ltd(NASDAQ:AVGO) generally charge pennies per unit because of the large volumes.Is it any wonder that QCOM is so profitable? During the past five years, the company generated a whopping$32 billionin pretax profits.According to areportfrom RBC's Amit Daryanani:""It would be more material if AAPL gets a lower price on IP licensing vs. what they currently pay to QCOM (QTL portion of the revenues). Furthermore, in theory AAPL could procure basebands from INTC at perhaps lower ASP's and that could be another tailwind to AAPL's gross-margins (QCOM's QCT revenue).""Then there is this from Bernstein Research analystStacy Rasgon:""Rather, AAPL is attempting a direct assault on Qualcomm's basic licensing business model, attacking the 'essential' nature of their IP, and directly targeting QCOM's device-level royalty model. The suit doesn't read well for the future of the chipset relationship either.""Bottom Line On AAPL StockNaturally, there's plenty of daylight between now and any sort of decision, let alone any impact of Apple shares. Litigation is time-consuming and far from predictable.Why Sprint Corp (S) Stock Could Blow Up in Your     FaceIn the meantime, the key for Apple is the upcoming iPhone 8. And there are encouraging signs that this could be the turnaround spark AAPL stock needs. The buzz is that there will be whiz-bang features like gesture and facial recognition, as well as wireless charging and OLED (organic light-emitting diode) screens, which will be thinner and perhaps even allow for bending.What's more, the valuation on Apple stock remains attractive, with a forward price-to-earnings multiple of just 12X. This is at a discount to other mega-tech operators, such asMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) at 19X andOracle Corporation(NYSE:ORCL) at 14 - and they certainly don't have the kinds of products that will gin up anywhere near the excitement (or potential growth) of a new iPhone.Tom Taulli runs the InvestorPlace blogIPO Playbookand also is the developer of aniOS app for taxes.Follow him on Twitter at@ttaulli.

Samsung (SSNLF): TWO Different Battery Failures on Galaxy Note 7;January 23, 2017, 09:49:52 AM EDT;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSamsung Electronic(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) held a press conference this weekend that was buried by coverage of the U.S. presidential inauguration and the Women's March on Washington. The company announced the final results of its Galaxy Note 7 investigation, and according to Samsung, there was not one buttwoseparate Galaxy Note 7 battery flaws to blame.Source:Sylwia Bartyzel Via UnsplashThe second was introduced in the replacement battery after the initial issue was discovered.makeArticleAd();Samsung's Galaxy Note 7 Testing MarathonIt was pretty obvious once Galaxy Note 7s started bursting into flames that the battery was involved. But when the problems continued with replacement smartphones using a new battery from a different supplier, suddenly the root cause got murkier.At thepress conference, Samsung explained just how deeply it investigated the Galaxy Note 7.10 Blue-Chip Stocks That Could Be Holding You     BackEverything from the new USB-C port, to wireless charging and even software overload was closely studied and eliminated as a factor. So was Samsung's manufacturing process. The company built four test facilities (one at each site where it assembled the doomed smartphone) and put 700 engineers to work testing 200,000 Galaxy Note 7s plus 30,000 Galaxy Note 7 battery packs on their own. External testers from three different firms were also added to the teams.Exploding Galaxy Note 7 Battery Cause: Almost UnbelievableThe result?It turns out that SSNLF got hit by an almost unbelievable coincidence.In its rush to take advantage of the expected low-keyApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone 7 launch, it used a battery sourced from an unnamed supplier, that had a hidden design flaw. The battery lacked sufficient space to expand and contract - as batteries do - when charging and discharging. As a result, the battery's electrodes could touch, then short circuit. This issue was not caught by the battery manufacturer.Samsung pointed out that for its own quality assurance team to have noticed the problem, they would have had to X-Ray the batteries.Batteries from a second supplier (also un-named) used in some Galaxy Note 7s were fine. They became the go-to replacement batteries once the first wave of trouble began. However, Samsung then pushed that second supplier to dramatically increase its Galaxy Note 7 battery production volume.The demand to quickly churn out 10 million batteries overwhelmed that company's production capability and manufacturing defects crept in. A faulty internal weld could cause these replacement batteries to also short circuit and again, the defect was not visible.Samsung's Safety Pledge and the Galaxy S8Samsung took full responsibility for the Galaxy Note 7 battery fiasco, admitting that it had pushed suppliers and the limits of the manufacturing process.Going forward, the company is implementing an8-point battery safety checkthat includes accelerated usage testing, durability tests, X-Ray examination and physically disassembling the batteries.In recognition that lithium-ion batteries can be extremely volatile, Samsung has also committed to leaving more space around the battery packs in its smartphones going forward. While this runs contrary to the ""thinner at all cost"" mentality that Samsung and Apple have been pursuing, additional buffer space will protect the battery from impacts.In aninterview with Recode, Samsung's mobile division head said: ""I wish [that] this serves as an opportunity to improve safety of lithium-ion not only for Samsung but for the entire industry.""Samsung also made it clear that the Galaxy S8 - due for release this spring - will be covered by the enhanced battery safety procedures.Bank of America Corp's (BAC) Irrational     Exuberance Will EndThat Galaxy S8 launch will be the critical test of whether SSNLF truly recovers from the Galaxy Note 7 battery fiasco. The chapter is estimated to havecost the company $10 billion, Samsung stock took a hit (although strong performance by its chips division more than made up for that) and its brand was damaged.If consumers accept Samsung's findings, apology and pledge to prevent this from happening in the future, the Galaxy S8 could see a sales rebound. If the Galaxy Note 7 battery episode still surrounds the company, Apple's iPhone 8 stands a chance of clawing back share from Android when it launches in the fall and the Samsung's place on top of the Android pyramid could ultimately be in doubt.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in   any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceApple Inc.

Synaptics (SYNA) Q2 Earnings: What to Expect this Time?;January 23, 2017, 09:41:00 AM EDT;"Synaptics Inc.SYNAis set to report second-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Jan 26. Last quarter, the company posted a negative earnings surprise of 8.82%. In the trailing four quarters, the company has posted a positive average earnings surprise of 33.27%.Moreover, in the past year Synaptics' shares have generated a negative return of 21.51% compared with the ZacksElectronics Semi-conductorsIndustry's gain of 77.91%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this quarter.Factors to ConsiderSynaptics is primarily engaged in developing human interface solutions for a wide array of mobile computing and communications devices and is one of the leading suppliers of TouchPads to the notebook computer market. The company's clientele includes Apple Inc.AAPL, Xiaomi, Samsung, Huawei and Lenovo among others.The company remains focused on enhancing its Automotive Solutions and Touch and Display Driver Integration (TDDI) and fingerprint portfolio. We expect the company to continue gaining from improved margins of each of its product lines. Moreover, strong shareholder repurchase plan will continue to cushion the company's earnings.Its partnership with Huawei has greatly expanded its offerings. However, intensifying competition and ongoing troubles with the flagship smartphones of Apple and Samsung especially in China can prove to be a headwind for the company as it derives a significant portion of its revenues from these companies.For second-quarter 2017, the company expects revenues in a range of $430 million to $470 million.

Here Are the Most Damning Parts of Apple's Blockbuster Lawsuit Against Qualcomm;January 23, 2017, 09:40:00 AM EDT;"After years of ""forced"" exclusivity, Apple finally added   another baseband supplier in the iPhone 7. Image source:   Apple.Just days after the Federal Trade Commission suedQualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM) for antitrust concerns,Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) took an unprecedented step of similarly filling   suit against one of its most important suppliers. The complaints   are largely the same, but Apple felt compelled to file its own   lawsuit in part to get nearly $1 billion that it says it is owed.   According to the complaint, Qualcomm gives Apple rebates that   effectively serve as royalty relief, but in exchange Apple has   agreed to buy baseband processors exclusively from the company   for the past five years. It's these rebates that Qualcomm is now   withholding since Apple has cooperated with antitrust regulators   around the world.makeArticleAd();AppleInsider's Mikey Campbell unearthed the entire 104-page   complaint and posted it onScribd. I'd encourage Apple investors to give it a look, but for those   that aren't inclined to spend their weekends reading legal   complaints, I've read through it in full and here are the most   damning things that Qualcomm is being accused of. (All bold   emphasis added by me.)Qualcomm tried to get Apple to change its testimonyThe Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) fined Qualcomm $853   million just last month, based in part on Apple's testimony to   the KFTC. When Qualcomm learned that Apple would be cooperating   with the investigation, it tried to use the royalty rebates as   leverage:Qualcomm claims that Apple has forfeited those amounts by     responding to requests in the course of an investigation by the     Korea Fair Trade Commission (""KFTC""), which recently levied the     largest fine in its history against Qualcomm. Qualcomm has     withheld the required contractual payments from Apple even     though the agreement clearly permits Apple to respond to the     KFTC's lawful investigation and requests for information.If that were not enough, Qualcomm then attempted to     extort Apple into changing its responses and providing     false information to the KFTC in exchange for Qualcomm's     release of those payments to Apple. Apple refused.There's little enforcement of whether patents are actually   essentialWhen patents are deemed standards-essential by   standard-setting organizations (SSOs), they become incredibly   powerful. But companies are able to declare their patents as   essential, and SSOs do not validate these claims:Patent owners, like Qualcomm, can claim that their patents     are SEPs without having to prove that they are essential. Many     SSOs expressly declare that they do not test declarations of     essentiality or validity for accuracy. For example, one widely     recognized SSO, the European Telecommunications Standards     Institute (""ETSI""), affirmatively states that it has ""No     involvement"" in ""the assessment of the validity and     essentiality of patents declared as SEPs.""Apple is challenging the validity of some of Qualcomm's   standards-essential patents (SEPs).Qualcomm has violated its FRAND commitmentsCompanies that have SEP portfolios are required to license   those patents to rivals at fair, reasonable, and   non-discriminatory (FRAND) rates. Qualcomm is egregiously   refusing to offer FRAND licensing:Violation of the FRAND bargain can take several forms,     including demanding unreasonable royalties; applying royalties     discriminatorily (for example, charging different licensees     different amounts or imposing differing conditions on different     licensees, or conditioning royalties on licensees' agreement to     advantage the patent owner's products); and asserting that     patents are essential to the standard when in fact they are     not.Qualcomm is guilty of all three.Rivals never had a chanceMany companies have exited the baseband processor market over   the past decade. It wasn't just intense competition, either --   they never had a chance because Qualcomm cornered the market by   leveraging its patent portfolio:By refusing to license its SEPs to competing chipset     manufacturers, and by refusing to sell its chipsets to     customers unless they first license Qualcomm's SEPs, Qualcomm     forced purchasers of its chipsets to take a license to its SEPs     at extortion-level royalties. By threatening ""disloyal"" chipset     customers with even less-favorable royalties and license terms     if they purchased chipsets from Qualcomm's competitors,     discriminating between potential licensees by refusing to     license its SEPs to competitors, and offering only ""rebates""     rather than a direct FRAND license, Qualcomm excluded     competition in the chipset market. And by foreclosing     competitors from dealing with Apple, a key purchaser of     chipsets,Qualcomm facilitated the marginalization and exit of     many of those competitors, enhancing its own monopoly     power.Apple's contract manufacturers are partially responsibleApple doesn't license Qualcomm's patents directly, and not for   a lack of trying. Instead, its contract manufacturers ink   licensing deals, and subsequently pass along the royalty costsin fullto Apple. The contract manufacturers like Foxconn don't bother   negotiating, since Apple foots the bill. These agreements are   confidential, and Qualcomm won't even let Apple see them:Rather than grant Apple a direct license on FRAND terms,     Qualcomm has instead entered into confidential licenses with     specific Apple contract manufacturers (""CMs""), the third-party     manufacturers who make and assemble Apple products. The CMs pay     the exorbitant royalties Qualcomm demands and pass the costs     along to Apple in full.Qualcomm uses these secret licenses to conceal its     anticompetitive licensing practices. Here is how it works:     Qualcomm knows that Apple is shouldering the entire royalty     burden, but by licensing the CMs and not Apple,Qualcomm can demand higher royalties because the CMs     have no incentive to negotiate.In fact, the CMs have agreed to license Qualcomm's SEPs on     non-FRAND terms, locking Apple into outrageous royalties. And     the agreements are confidential; Apple cannot even see or     review them. The CMs have expressed willingness to show Apple     their Qualcomm licenses, subject to Qualcomm's consent, but     Qualcomm has refused to give that consent.Apple pays more for lessQualcomm is but one of many companies that hold SEPs and   contribute to cellular standards. Apple has to pay Qualcomm more   than everyone else combined:Qualcomm's exorbitant royalties are price gouging, plain and     simple: between [REDACTED] per device, [REDACTED]. In 2016,     this was an order of magnitude greater than the royalties that     Apple pays to any other patent holder, and indeed ismore than Apple pays to all other cellular patent     holders combined.Qualcomm used Apple to kill WiMAXOnce upon a time, WiMAX was a competing 4G standard. Apple   never released a WiMAX iPhone, which helped contribute to the   standard's loss to LTE, which has emerged as the dominant 4G   technology:The 2007 Marketing Incentive Agreement (""MIA"") capped     Apple's royalties for UMTS chipsets, payable at that time on     purchases of Infineon's chipsets. In exchange, Apple was     obliged to refrain from marketing wireless devices implementing     a competing wireless communication standard, WiMAX. Qualcomm     forced Apple to renounce WiMAX just as WiMAX was gaining     traction in the marketplace.Qualcomm acted to eliminate the competitive threat     posed by WiMAX by ensuring that Apple would not market wireless     devices with WiMAX technology.This has been going on for nearly a decadeThe iPhone is now10 years old, and as such Apple has been seeking a direct license ever   since.Fornearly ten years, Qualcomm has failed to offer Apple a license for its cellular     SEPs on FRAND terms.Qualcomm makes money when you upgrade storageSince Qualcomm's royalty structure is calculated as a   percentage of the device's price, the company collects more for   more expensive phones:In addition, a royalty base premised on final selling prices     means that Qualcomm charges manufacturers of high-value,     feature-rich smartphones substantially more for a license than     it charges manufacturers of basic cellphones,despite the fact that the embodied wireless     communications functionality in the two products is     similar or identical.This is inconsistent with the FRAND promise.Compared to a $100 Kyocera LTE smartphone, Apple estimates   that its royalty payment for a $400 iPhone SE is ""four to nine   times more than Kyocera's royalty for its smartphone."" That also   means Qualcomm collects more when customers pay as much as $200   more for increased storage capacity, a feature that has nothing   to do with cellular connectivity.Apple has wanted to bring on competing basebands suppliers   for yearsIt goes without saying that Apple considers a wide range of   suppliers for nearly all of its components, considering the   significant benefits of dual-sourcing (reduced supply risk,   increased leverage in pricing negotiations, etc.). But it   couldn't:Given the opportunity, many device manufacturers, including     Apple, would prefer to license Qualcomm's SEPs at FRAND rates,     and to purchase baseband processor chipsets from     Qualcomm's competitors, rather than be forced to purchase from     Qualcomm a bundle comprising a license to Qualcomm's SEPs and     substantial quantities of baseband processor chipsets....Although Apple hasfor many years been ready and able to switcha smaller portion of its baseband processor chipset     purchases (e.g., for non-CDMA iPads) to Qualcomm's rivals,     Qualcomm's imposition of exclusivity has prevented Apple from     switching suppliers on a less than full-line basis, even withnon-Qualcomm chipsets priced substantially lower than     comparable Qualcomm chipsets.There's more where that came fromThese are the most interesting snippets within the filing, but   there is a lot of other information about Apple's contentious   relationship with Qualcomm over the years. This case is going to   be a big storyline for the two companies in 2017, and the legal   process could even potentially drag on for years unless Apple and   Qualcomm settle.If the pair make it to trial, investors can expect even more   juicy details to finally see the light of day.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Traders are beginning to shift away from the U.S. dollar,   with the Japanese yen drawing a safe-haven bid, and oil is also   moving lower. In earnings,Halliburton Company(NYSE:HAL),McDonald's Corporation(NYSE:MCD) andYahoo! Inc.(NASDAQ:YHOO) will be in focus later today.Heading into the open, futures on theDow Jones Industrial Averagehad slipped 0.1%, whileS&P 500andNasdaq-100futures were both lower by 0.19%.makeArticleAd();On the options front, Friday's Jan. 2017 expiration drove   massive volume with more than 21.3 million calls and 18.6 million   puts crossing the tape. Over on the CBOE, the single-session   equity put/call volume ratio whipsawed from a one-month low of   0.59 on Thursday to a two-week high of 0.70. The 10-day moving   average, however, held steady at 0.65.Turning to Friday's volume leaders,Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) saw accelerated bullish bids following report the company is   planning new iPad launches in the first half of 2017. Elsewhere,Rite Aid Corporation(NYSE:RAD) puts gained popularity after the Federal Trade Commission (FTC)   balked atWalgreens Boots Alliance Inc's(NASDAQ:WBA) buyout plan. Finally,International Business Machines Corp.(NYSE:IBM) hit a fresh all-time high following strong fourth-quarter   earnings.Apple Inc. (AAPL)AAPL stock finished Friday pinned at $120, as heavy call and   put accumulations at the expiring Jan. 2017 $120 strike proved   too much for the stock to overcome.10 Blue-Chip Stocks That Could Be Holding You       BackThe shares had plenty of bullish drivers on the session,   including a report that Apple was preparing to launch a slate of   revamped iPads in the first half of 2017.Specifically, apre-publication note in DigiTimessaid that Apple is building a ""9.7-inch iPad with a friendly   price range"" for the first quarter, with an updated 12.9-inch   iPad Pro and a 10.5-inch iPad for the second quarter. However,   the note doesn't call the 12.9-inch iPad a ""Pro"" model.Volume was brisk on AAPL stock Friday, with nearly 1.1 million   contracts traded on the shares. What's more, calls accounted for   a well above average 71% of the day's take. Overall, traders   remain heavily focused on the $120 strike in both the 27 Jan. and   3 Feb. series, with the latter bearing the brunt of speculation   heading into next week's quarterly earnings report.Rite Aid Corporation (RAD)RAD put options were smart money ahead of Friday's selloff. On   Wednesday last week, a trade publication reported expectations   for a WBA deal approval ahead of Trump's inauguration. Instead of   optimism,RAD puts flooded the market.Friday brought a decision on the WBA deal, with the FTC saying   that Walgreens's proposal to sell 865 drugstores toFred's, Inc.(NASDAQ:FRED) wasnot enough to seal the deal. In fact, the FTC worried about Fred's taking over so many   stores.RAD stock plunged more than 13% on the news, with options   traders once again turning to puts in the wake of the report.   Volume for RAD swelled to nearly 950,000 contracts, with puts   snapping up 74% of the day's take. According toTrade-Alert.com, the largest block trade on Friday took place at the Feb. 17 $6   put, where 33,000 contracts traded at the bid of 28 cents,   hinting at expectations that RAD may find a floor before the   selling runs much further.International Business Machines Corp. (IBM)IBM shares vaulted to a fresh 52-week high following Friday's   better-than-expected quarterly report.IBM said it earned$5.01 per share on sales of $21.77 billion, compared to   expectations for $4.88 per share on sales of $21.63 billion. The   company also boosted its 2017 guidance to $13.80 per share versus   the consensus estimate for $13.74 per share.United Continental Holdings Inc (UAL) Stock       Could Fake Us All OutIBM stock rose more than 2% following the report, though   options traders remained rather reserved. Total volume came in at   305,000 contracts, with calls only eking out 54% of the day's   take.Currently, peak Feb. 17 call OI totals nearly 5,700 contracts   at the $170 strike, with another 5,500 open at the $175 strike.

Qualcomm (QCOM) Faces $1B Patent Royalty Suit from Apple;January 23, 2017, 05:51:00 AM EDT;"Qualcomm Inc.QCOM, the largest mobile chipset manufacturer using baseband technology globally, has recently been pressed with a $1 billion lawsuit related to licensing royalty payments by tech giant Apple Inc.AAPL. In the lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California, Apple has accused Qualcomm of overcharging for chips and refusing to pay some $1 billion in promised rebates.Notably, just a couple of days before filing of Apple's lawsuit, Qualcomm had faced an anti-trust lawsuit from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC). The regulator filed a lawsuit with the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California claiming that the company has used anticompetitive measures to maintain a monopoly in baseband chipset market.The FTC said Qualcomm had established an exclusivity agreement with iPhone and iPAD maker Apple from 2011 to 2016. Through this deal the San Diego-based chipmaker provided billions of dollars in license rebates to Apple subject to the condition that Apple would not use chipset of Qualcomm's rival companies. The company recognized that any competitor that won Apple's business would become stronger, and used exclusivity of the deal to prevent the latter from working with and improving the effectiveness of its competitors.However, Qualcomm argued that the FTC's complaint is based on ""flawed legal theory, a lack of economic support and significant misconceptions about the mobile technology industry"". While the chipset maker observes major flaws in the accusations, it is likely get a full hearing. In the last five trading days, the stock price of Qualcomm has declined 5.34% on Nasdaq.The FTC alleged that Qualcomm has barred competitors from getting a foothold in the baseband chipset market by using unfair means to secure business, thereby harming consumer choice. Notably, Intel Corp.INTCand Media Tek are closest competitors of Qualcomm in this field. In addition to iOS, Qualcomm chipsets are vastly used for Alphabet Inc.'sGOOGLGoogle developed Android software and Microsoft Corp.MSFTdeveloped Windows operating system.Qualcomm generates approximately 29% of its total revenue from the licensing business however, this business accounts for almost 77% of the company's net profit. Moreover, the company has a history of facing allegations related to licensing disputes. The US regulator is latest in the line of accusers alleging Qualcomm of abusing its dominant position and imposing unfair licensing terms.In 2015, the Chinese regulatory authority, National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) fined Qualcomm nearly $975 million for abusing China's anti-competitive terms. In Dec 2016, the company was fined nearly $886 million in South Korea for restrictive licensing practices. Moreover, since 2011, Qualcomm has been under investigation for competition violations in the European Union region.In its filing, Apple has accused Qualcomm of pressurizing the company in providing false statement to South Korea's antitrust regulator, the Korea Fair Trade Commission regarding the above mentioned anti-trust case in that country. Apple and Samsung Electronics are the two major customers of Qualcomm's chipsets for modems that connect phones to wireless networks. The two companies together accounted for over 40% of Qualcomm's $23.5 billion in revenue in fiscal 2016 (ended in Sep 2016). Thus, a royalty lawsuit from Apple may harm Qualcomm in big way.Price Performance of QualcommIn the last one year, the stock price of Qualcomm has gained a substantial 32.16% compared with 5.97% loss witnessed by the Zacks categorizedWireless Equipmentindustry. Qualcomm, the undisputed leader in the global wireless baseband chipset market is widening its presence in adjacent opportunities, including automotive, networking, and mobile computing strategies which bode well for long-term growth. Qualcomm's Snapdragon processor is best known for its versatility in IoT applications.However, aggressive competition in the mobile phone chipset market, stringent regulatory norms and anti-competitive charges are some of the major headwinds faced by the company.

Will Samsung Be Able to Repair Its Brand Image?;January 21, 2017, 10:10:07 PM EDT;"Currently,Samsung(SSNLF) andApple(AAPL) are the two foremost players in the worldwide smartphone industry followed by Huawei at the third position. Samsung is the undisputed leader in the smartphone industry, as it holds 21% market share, whereas Apple holds just 12.5% market share.Samsung was off to a great start in 2016, and the company's momentum got a boost soon after the launch of its latest flagship Galaxy S7 models. According to t3.com, before the launch of the Apple iPhone 7 Plus, the Galaxy S7 Edge was the world's best smartphone. Samsung's Galaxy S7 Edge successfully managed to hold the world's best smartphone position for over six months.After the launch of the Galaxy S7 models, Samsung launched its new flagship Galaxy Note 7, which was intended to be a tough competitor for Apple's iPhone 7 models. Everything was moving in the right direction and in favour of Samsung until the Note 7 models started exploding.makeArticleAd();At the end, Samsung was forced to terminate the production of Note 7 models and also announced an official recall of Note 7 devices because of the safety issues. The company reported that some batteries were irregularly sized that resulted in overheating, whereas others had manufacturing defects. The detailed explanation on this topic will be unveiled on Jan. 23.Despite facing a severe problem, Samsung managed to remain in the green in 2016, thanks to the popularity of the Galaxy S7 models. However, the company is trying hard to recover from the damage caused to its brand.For Samsung, a quick comeback is essential for the sake of its reputation. The company's comeback phone could be its next flagship Galaxy S8 model. It is likely that Samsung will unveil its next flagship device next month at its upcoming Galaxy Unpacked event in Barcelona, ahead of MWC.There are several rumours that Galaxy S8 will include a 4K screen, a mini projector, a 30 megapixel camera, 6GB of RAM, a mammoth battery as well as a supercharged processor.Summing upSamsung is well aware of its mistake and trying hard to repair its brand image. Samsung's Galaxy S7 models became very popular in 2016, and same is expected from its upcoming flagship models this year. In comparison to Apple, Samsung brings more innovation in its devices, which make it a better investment candidate.Disclosure:No position in the stocks mentioned in this article.Start a free seven-day trial of Premium Membership to GuruFocus.Premium MembersThis article first appeared onGuruFocus."
Will Apple Raise Its Dividend in 2017?;January 21, 2017, 08:02:00 AM EDT;"The success ofApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) has made many investors rich, and throughout most   of the tech giant's history, dividends played a tiny role.   Recently, though, Apple has embraced dividends, and now, some   income-hungry investors look to the iPhone maker for its   quarterly payouts as well as its potential for stock-price   increases. With tax reform proposals that could unlock some of   Apple's overseas cash stash, Apple might be in a better position   than ever to consider a dividend boost this year. Let's look more   closely to see if Apple is likely to raise its dividend in   2017.Image source: Apple.Dividend stats on AppleCurrent Quarterly Dividend Per SharemakeArticleAd();$0.57Current Yield1.9%Number of Consecutive Years With Dividend             IncreasesFive yearsPayout Ratio27%Last IncreaseMay 2016Data source: Yahoo! Finance. Last increase refers to   ex-dividend date.Apple's dividend history is short but sweetLike many tech stocks, Apple was slow to jump on the dividend   bandwagon. The company paid a small dividend during the late   1980s and early 1990s, but it stopped making those payments in   1995 and left shareholders with a 17-year period during which   they received nothing in dividends from Apple.In 2012,Apple restored its dividend, setting a quarterly payout of about $0.38 per share when you   adjust for the 7-for-1 split the tech company made in 2014. That   worked out to a yield of a bit less than 2% and a payout ratio of   about 30% of Apple's earnings at the time, which was in line with   what many other technology companies had done with their dividend   policies.Since then, Apple has rewarded dividend investors with payout   boosts every year. Increases of 15% and 8% came in 2013 and 2014   respectively, and subsequent increases have been roughly 10% each   year. Along the way, Apple has become one of the biggest payers   of dividends in the stock market, routinely sending more than $10   billion in capital back to shareholders every year through its   quarterly payouts.AAPL Dividenddata byYCharts.Yet not everyone was happy about Apple's emergence as a   dividend giant. Even when the dividend first began in 2012, some   saw the move as a sign that Apple's days as a growth stock had   come to an end. Fears arose that Apple would begin to resemble   worse-performing mature tech stocks, despite the success of its   budding lines of mobile devices.What's ahead for Apple?If nothing else, the fact that Apple has achieved the largest   market capitalization of any stock in the market has reduced its   future growth potential to some extent. Yet the iPhone maker has   continued to increase its free cash flow, securing funding   necessary for its double-digit percentage dividend increases each   year. Some criticize Apple's failure to deliver revolutionary   innovations in recent years, but the company has effectively   taken advantage of still-strong demand for its mobile products   and has sustained customer loyalty with incremental evolutionary   changes to the devices over time.Indeed, even with its dividend hikes over the years, Apple's   payout ratio has fallen slightly, now resting in the mid- to   upper-20s as a percentage of earnings. If Apple were to decide   that its growth potential had in fact slowed, it would be natural   to pay a higher proportion of income to shareholders as   dividends, and that could bring a big jump in yield to the   stock.Finally, the potential for tax reform could prompt a different   approach to dividend policy. Currently, Apple keeps considerable   amounts of cash overseas in order to avoid repatriation taxes.   With the incoming Trump administration considering tax cuts to   encourage businesses like Apple to bring capital back to the   U.S., the Cupertino-based tech giant might take advantage of such   provisions and boost the amount it returns to shareholders.Will Apple raise its dividend in 2017?For now, Apple remains squarely in growth mode, and so a   typical 10% increase would bring the quarterly dividend up to   $0.63 per share. At current prices, that would push the yield   slightly above the 2% mark, keeping pace with recent stock-price   gains. The tech giant has made a habit of announcing its annual   dividend increases in late April, and there's no reason to expect   a departure from that practice in 2017. The only serious question   is whether any future change in tax policy could prompt a   response from Apple in accelerating its dividend growth going   forward.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Hedge Funds See Record High Assets, Value Strategies Beating Growth;January 20, 2017, 06:00:05 PM EDT;"For the first time in years, value-oriented hedge funds are notching results higher than those of growth funds. As return results for 2016 roll in, several prominent funds have reported market-beating gains, but data from Hedge Fund Research Institute on Tuesday confirms that funds categorized as ""value"" beat those focused on ""growth"" on 12-month, three-year and four-year annual bases.In the category of equity hedge funds, the HFRX EH: Fundamental Value Index returned 0.85% in December, 3.64% in the past 12 months, 0.42% in the past three years and 4.12% in the past four years. The HFRX EH: Fundamental Growth Index declined 1.12%, 6.55%, 1.88% and 0.4% for the same periods.The Fundamental Value Index also exceeded the general HFRX Global Hedge Fund Index in all periods except for December. It returned 0.86% for the month, 2.50% in the past 12 months, lost 0.6% in the past three years and gained 2.46% in the past four years.makeArticleAd();A screen shows that the hedge funds tracked by GuruFocus have the greatest consensus on Alphabet (GOOG), Alphabet (GOOGL) Bank of America (BAC), Apple (AAPL) and Facebook (FB), whose value status would be arguable by different managers. Each of the stocks appreciated by double digits over the past year.The gains come against a 20.5% rise in the S&P 500, though, that extended the five-year market rally of 72%.Despite reports of clients fleeing hedge funds due to lackluster returns, HFR released another study Friday saying that total assets under management in the industry rose above $3 trillion for the first time. Total capital increased by $46.8 billion in the fourth quarter, to $3.02 billion at the end of the year.

Qualcomm Faces a Nasty New Lawsuit Regarding Apple;January 20, 2017, 01:43:00 PM EDT;"The U.S. Federal Trade Commission recently filed  an   antitrust lawsuit againstQualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM) , claiming that the mobile chipmaker leveraged its   portfolio of crucial wireless patents to force competitors out of   the market. The Commission claims that Qualcomm charged its   baseband modem competitors higher license fees for its wireless   patents, making it more expensive for smartphone makers to use   rival modems.Image source: Qualcomm.makeArticleAd();At the center of this case isApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) , which once considered launching an iPhone for   the 4G WiMax networks championed byIntel(NASDAQ: INTC) andSprint(NYSE: S) . Qualcomm opposed WiMax, since it generated much lower   royalties from that standard, and supported the LTE standard   instead.The FTC claims that to prevent Apple from launching a WiMax   iPhone after Sprint deployed its first WiMax network in 2008,   Qualcomm ""agreed to rebate to Apple royalties"" received from the   iPhone maker's contract manufacturers ""in excess of a specified   per-handset cap."" In other words, Qualcomm allegedly let Apple   pay lower royalties to secure a long-term spot in the iPhone,   lock rivals out of the baseband market, and deal a fatal blow to   the WiMax standard.The consequences of that dealThat alleged deal certainly helped Qualcomm, which remained   Apple's exclusive supplier of baseband modems until the iPhone 7,   which uses both Qualcomm and Intel modems. Qualcomm's biggest   baseband modem rivals --Texas InstrumentsandBroadcom-- both retreated from the market as Qualcomm's market share   rose. The death of WiMax dealt a devastating blow to Sprint,   which had invested billions in a dying standard and was forced to   invest billions more in LTE networks.The FTC didn't outline any specific penalties against   Qualcomm, but  ordered it ""to cease its anticompetitive   conduct and take actions to restore competitive conditions."" But   with the iPhone 7's modem production already split between   Qualcomm and Intel, Qualcomm could easily argue that ""competitive   conditions"" have been restored.Furthermore, Qualcomm could note that Intel's payment of   ""contra revenues"" (discounted chips, co-marketing agreements, and   financial assistance in redesigning logic boards) to OEMs in   exchange for using its mobile Atom chips was similar to its   rebate agreement with Apple.The sound and fury (probably) signifies     nothingMost importantly, a Republican-led FTC probably won't   prosecute Qualcomm. The FTC voted  2-1 to charge Qualcomm --   with two Democrats supporting the lawsuit and one Republican,   Maureen K. Ohlhausen, voting against it, declaring that there was   ""no robust economic evidence"" of anticompetitive effects from the   deal.One of those Democrats has already resigned, and the other   commissioner's term will expire soon. President-elect Trump is   expected to name Ohlhausen as  the acting chairwoman, and   the new vacancies could be filled with Republicans who will   likely support Ohlhausen's argument. Therefore, Qualcomm could   simply receive a slap on the wrist without any serious fines.But the antitrust drama isn't over yet...Even if the FTC lawsuit fades away, Qualcomm still faces   billions of dollars in overseas fines. Chinese regulators hit   Qualcomm with a $975 million fine and forced it to lower its   licensing fees in 2015, South Korea fined it $854 million at the   end of 2016, and it could face up to $3 billion in additional   fines in Europe and Taiwan -- which are both currently   investigating the company for anticompetitive practices.These lawsuits could all hurt Qualcomm's QTL (licensing)   business, which generates the lion's share of its profits and   offsets the lower margins of its QCT (chipmaking) business. With   margins declining across the heavily commoditized smartphone   market, more OEMs and regulators will likely revolt against   Qualcomm's 3G/4G licensing fees -- which can  equal up to 5%   of a device's wholesale price. That could put tremendous pressure   on Qualcomm's earnings over the next few quarters.Should investors worry about these lawsuits?The lawsuits against Qualcomm reveal how badly the   commoditization of the smartphone market hurts the company. Its   QCT revenues are falling due to fierce competition from cheaper   ARM licensees like MediaTek, but its QTL revenues are also being   weighed down by desperate OEMs which hope lower licensing fees   can help them squeeze out more profits per handset.These antitrust lawsuits won't sink Qualcomm, which is   expected to generate nearly $24 billion in revenues this year.   But they represent a dangerous paradigm shift in the market, and   explains why the chipmaker isaggressively diversifyinginto adjacent markets like connected cars, drones, wearables, and   Internet of Things devices.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Rite Aid Corporation (RAD) Stock Cracks With Walgreens Merger in Doubt;January 20, 2017, 12:12:22 PM EDT;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsRite Aid Corporation(NYSE:RAD) plunged, were halted and remained considerably lower after resuming trading after a Friday report that puts its merger withWalgreens Boots Alliance Inc(NASDAQ:WBA) in serious doubt.makeArticleAd();Source:Mike Mozart via FlickrBloomberg reported on Friday that people familiar with the matter say Walgreens' blueprint for gaining Federal Trade Commission approvalis coming up short in the eyes of FTC lawyers. The biggest concession of the deal is the sale of 865 drugstores toFred's Inc.RAD stock gained more than 20% on the Oct. 27, 2015, report that Walgreens - the country's No. 2 chain by store locations - would buy America's No. 3. Since then, shares have mostly hung around the $8 level, with a few peaks and valleys depending on sentiment about the deal.That said, RAD had accelerated nicely since President Trump's election, not just on the broader market's back but also on increasing optimism that the deal would be approved.Now, however, after more than a year of review, the FTC reportedly still has competition concerns, which means the deal might not go through by a Jan. 27 deadline.7 Stocks to Sell Before They ImplodeWhile some believed the RAD-WBA merger would be approved today, Betsy Lordan, senior public affairs specialist for the Federal Trade Commission, told Drug Store News via email:""[The decision] won't happen [on Inauguration Day]. More generally, however, we do not confirm or comment on merger investigations until/unless we are announcing legal action such as a complaint or (in some cases) a complaint and proposed settlement.""If the deal falls through, Rite Aid would receive either $325 million or $650 million in termination fees.WBA stock also was off about 2% on Friday.

Square Inc (SQ) Stock Needs to Make Some Money;January 20, 2017, 12:11:11 PM EDT;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSquare Inc.(NYSE:SQ) has never been a money-making proposition. Like many tech companies, net income has not been their thing, man.Growthhas been their thing. Revenues rose from $552 million in 2013 to $1.267 billion two years later, and that record will likely be beaten when the company next reports on Jan. 31.makeArticleAd();Source:Chris Harrison via Flickr (Modified)Analysts are expecting$451 million in revenue for the quarter, or $1.307 billion for the year. The whisper on losses, 8 cents per share, would bring total losses for the year to 46 cents. Square survives on hope and cash flow, which was slightly positive in 2015 and the third quarter of 2016. Its growth is slowing noticeably.But what if, just for fun, Square did something wild, crazy, and in-line with what the rest of the payments industry does, and made a little money for shareholders?The stock would take off. It would take off bigly.How Square Stock Might Make MoneySquare is not going to make a net profit as a processor. It's not going to bypass exchange fees. Instead it's going to become profitable as a platform, with a host of financial products attractive to its small business base.The 7 Best High-Yield Investments for RetirementAs our James Brumley wrote this weekthese include Square Capital, whose loans havedoubled over the last year. Square is also offeringpayroll services, inventory management and analyticsto its small business customers.This hope has sent SQ stock up 56% in the last six months, which sounds great until you take the chart out a few months, and see that stock hit another peak in April, 2015, which took it higher than the present price of $14.90. At that point, speculation on brighter days had pushed it to $15.13.Who Wants SQ Stock?Partly for that reason, our Tom Taulli has another reason to buy Square stock.As takeout bait.Square has a powerful brand (at least within its niche), it's big in mobile, and there are a lot of big tech companies that aren't in payments yet but might like a play there, likeMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT).That's interesting, but if SQ stock were going to be taken out, the buyer would not likely come from that quarter. Processing is something a tech company can do for itself, if it's interested in that low-margin business. There are easier ways to make money.It's more likely the buyer would come from the payments mainstream - processors likeFirst Data Corp(NYSE:FDC),PayPal Holdings Inc(NASDAQ:PYPL) andVantiv Inc(NASDAQ:VNTV). These companies understand just how complex processing merchant payments are, and what the capacity is worth. Wait a few years and maybe some banking organizations likeJP Morgan Chase & Co.(NYSE:JPM) orCapital One Financial Corp.(NYSE:COF) might come calling.A move by any of these players could set off a feeding frenzy in the industry, one that would deliver shareholders a premium well over its current $5.3 billion price.That may be why a processor isn't making such a move. SQ stock is already bigger, by market cap, thanNCR Corporation(NYSE:NCR), which has been around since the 19th century.The ancillary businesses may also be unattractive. It's hard enough just processing payments.A winning premium would also make Square unaffordable for a merchant processor outfit like Vantiv, worth $12.3 billion, and make the merchants payment outfit vulnerable to takeover by one of the banks that distribute cards and serve the customer side of the transaction. MaybeIntuit Inc.(NASDAQ:INTU) orAmerican Express Company(NYSE:AXP) might be interested in upsetting the apple cart in that way, but again you're talking about a less-profitable operation and, in the case of Intuit (worth $30.1 billion), a deal that could soak up a lot of its market cap.A SpeculationThere are many companies that could make a move on SQ stock, setting off a frenzy of merger activity in the payments space akin to what everyone keeps expecting will happen in media after Sumner Redstone dies and the sharks come forViacom, Inc.(NASDAQ:VIAB).Is the Groupon Inc (GRPN) Comeback Done for Good?But waiting for such a frenzy, betting on it with your money, is speculation. Square today is still a money-losing proposition in an industry where losing money is uncommon, and a company whose growth is slowing rapidly.Go for it if you wish, but don't hock the silver. This is a mad money play.Dana Blankenhornis a financial and technology journalist. He is the author of the sci-fi novellaInto the Cloud, available at the Amazon Kindle store.

Donald Trump Inauguration: Stocks To Buy, Sell For The Next Four Years;January 20, 2017, 11:29:41 AM EDT;"Donald Trump (Shutterstock photo)Donald Trump has been sworn in as the 45th president of the United States. The President-elect, who pledged to Make America great again, promised plenty of things he would do regarding his first day in office. From repealing and replacing Obamacare to renegotiating NAFTA and beginning the construction of the wall on the Mexican border.We wont know for certain which of Trumps policies will take priority or how they will be enforced. But what we do know is that for Trump to make good on his promises to bring back jobs, grow GDP and strengthen industry, he needs businesses to lead, innovate and hire workers. For that to happen, businesses leaders need to know their government is on their side. To that end, here are some names to own for the next four years (at least) as Trumps policies take shape.makeArticleAd();Lower Corporate TaxesTrumps promise to lower corporate taxes can have a boosting effect on the tech sector, which has an estimated $1.4 trillion stashed in overseas tax havens. These include some America's largest corporations such as Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT), which could face a huge tax hit if they bring that cash home. Not only has Trump promised to lower the business tax rate from 35% to 15%, he pledged to eliminate the corporate alternative minimum tax.Beyond lowering the tax rate, it would hardly shock anyone if Trump  given his pro-business stance  were to enact a tax holiday at some point during his presidency. Companies like Cisco (CSCO), Facebook (FB) and Alphabet (GOOGL) would thrive. They would no longer need to borrow cheap cash to fund their operations. Likewise, a better capitalized Tesla (TSLA) can accelerate the building of its Gigafactory, helping it achieve not only higher profit margins, but also higher vehicle production. In the process, Tesla would ignite the state of Nevada as an innovative hub, while mass-producing producing emission-free vehicles at affordable prices.Repeal and ReplaceThe Affordable Care Act, a.k.a Obamacare was designed to  among other things  insure the un-insurable. Notably, to provide insurance coverage to people with pre-existing conditions who were blocked under the then-existing rules. Depending on what side of the aisle youre on, Obamacare either did its job or was a complete disaster, according to Trump. Still, whether Obamacare is entirely dismantled or parts of it is kept, you dont have to look too far beyond UnitedHealth (UNH) to find a stock can will thrive.UnitedHealth has worked aggressively to exit the Affordable Care exchanges, which reduces its  exposure to any changes Trump might make. Whats more, added from being the nation's largest health insurer, UnitedHealth owns Optum, which provides pharmacy benefit management services. Last week, not only did the company beat top- and bottom-line estimates, UnitedHealth raised its fiscal 2017 financial outlook, suggesting it is ready for whatever Trump decides to do.Not every company will be as lucky. Conversely, companies such HCA Holdings (HCA) and Universal Health Services (UHS) that prospered under Obamacare may suffer. As will government health care providers such as Centene Corporation (CNC) and Molina Healthcare, Inc. (MOH).Scale Back Dodd-FrankCutting down strict regulations imposed on financial institutions has been another policy Trump has proposed. After all, how can he achieve economic growth and strengthen small business if banks aren't lending money  something banks collectively struggled to do under Dodd-Frank. But as evidenced by the strong earnings results released so far from the likes of Bank of America (BAC), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C) and Goldman Sachs (GS), financials are once again the sector to bank on.Written to strengthen consumer protection and create tougher rules on excessive risk-taking, the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act has been cited by bank executives as a prohibiter of growth. ""There's many aspects of it that we've got to kill,"" said Steven Mnuchin, Trump's pick for Treasury secretary. Mnuchin former partner at Goldman Sachs, called Dodd-Frank ""the number one priority on the regulatory side.To that end, I would be surprised if Trump doesnt take to repeal and replace Dodd-Frank in his first 100 days in office. Combined with the prospect of higher interest rates, lower taxes its tough to ignore the potential upside a bank like Morgan Stanley (MS) can provide. Its not just the big banks that will prosper, however. Keep an eye on super regionals like Comerica (CMA), US Bancorp (USB) and PNC Financial (PNC), which Trump has made great again."
