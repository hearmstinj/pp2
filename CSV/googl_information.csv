Alphabet Rides Advertising Strength to New Highs;4/28/2017;"Google parentAlphabet Inc.(NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) released strong first-quarter 2017   results on Thursday after the market closed, highlighted by   continued strength in mobile and YouTube, as well as sustained   momentum for its other bets segment.Let's take a closer look, then, at what drove Alphabet's   business to start this year, and what investors should expect   from the company going forward.IMAGE SOURCE: ALPHABET INC.makeArticleAd();The big pictureQuarterly revenue grew 22.2% year over year (24% at constant   currency), to $24.75 billion, and translated to 23% growth in   operating income, to $6.568 billion. On the bottom line,GAAPnet income increased 29%, to $5.426 billion, and net income per   diluted share climbed 28.4%, to $7.73. Google doesn't   provide specific financial guidance, but both the top and bottom   lines were well ahead of consensus estimates for revenue of   $24.19 billion and earnings of $7.40 per share.""Our excellent results represent a terrific start to 2017,""   added Alphabet CFO Ruth Porat. ""We clearly continue to benefit   from our ongoing investments in product innovation and have great   momentum in our new businesses across Alphabet.""Alphabet breaks its results in to two primary segments: Google   and ""other bets."" Here's how they performed as compared to the   same year-ago period:Metric3 Months Ended March 31, 20163 Months Ended March 31, 2017Year-Over-Year GrowthGoogle segment revenues$20.092 billion$25.802 billion28.4%Google operating income$6.245 billion$7.598 billion21.7%Other bets revenues$165 million$244 million47.9%Other bets operating income (loss)($774 million)($855 million)N/ADATA SOURCE: ALPHABET, INC.On GoogleLet's start with Google, which is obviously Alphabet's   bread-and-butter segment and includes Search, Android, Maps,   Chrome, Google Play, Gmail, and YouTube, as well as Commerce,   Apps, Cloud, and hardware.Advertising comprised the bulk of Google's revenue, as usual,   rising 18.8% year over year, to $21.411 billion. Within that, ad   revenue from Google sites rose 21.5%, to $17.403 billion, with   the largest contributor being healthy growth from mobile search.   Advertising from Google network members' properties grew 8.6%, to   $4.008 billion.Meanwhile, Aggregate paid clicks grew 44% year over year,   including 53% growth in paid clicks on Google sites and a 10%   increase in those on network members' properties. Aggregate   cost per click -- which essentially measures how much Google   makes per ad -- declined 19% year over year, including 21% and   17% declines on Google properties and network member properties,   respectively. For that, investors can partly thank the continued   outperformance of YouTube, where TrueView ads tend to reach   consumers earlier in the purchase funnel and thus monetize at   lower rates than traditional web ads.That said, Alphabet also noted it changed its methodology for   paid clicks and cost per click this quarter ""to include   additional categories of TrueView engagement ads and exclude   non-engagement based trial ad formats."" As a result, the above   metrics reflect ""a modest increase in paid clicks and a modest   decrease in cost-per-click.""Google also kindly offered perspective with updated figures   for several previous quarters using the new methodology. For   example,last quarter, aggregate paid clicks climbed 36% as reported, and cost per   click fell 15%. But using the new method, Q4 2016 aggregate paid   clicks would have reflected higher 39% growth, and the decline in   cost per click would have been closer to 17%.Finally, other (non-advertising) revenue within Google   increased a strong 49.4% year over year, to $3.095 billion,   driven by Play, hardware, and cloud solutions.On other betsNext, Google's other bets segment remained unprofitable,as expected, while continuing to drive solid 47.9% year-over-year   growth in revenue (to $244 million) from its conglomeration of   compelling early-stage businesses. Similar to the past several   quarters since Alphabet shifted to thissegment-based reporting approach, other bets revenue was primarily generated by Nest (connected   home products), Verily (life sciences), and Fiber (high-speed   internet). But its operating loss also includes the costs of   other mostly pre-revenue businesses like Calico (focused on human   longevity), Google Capital (capital investments), and Google X   (""moonshot"" projects).""In Other Bets, we're determining the size and pace of   investment appropriate to each bet given their stage of   development and achievements against milestones,"" Porat   elaborated during this quarter's conference call. ""We expect to   increase near-term investment in certain areas while continuing   to calibrate the pace of investment in others as they move along   a path to commercialization.""Alphabet regularly reminds investors that because these   businesses operate in a number of disparate industries, and in   various stages of growth, their results don't enjoy the same   level of relative predictability as the mature advertising   segment.Looking forwardDuring the call, Porat also discussed the virtuous cycle   created by its core ad business, stating:The strong performance in our advertising business allows us     to take bigger bets within Google to fuel the growth of     additional revenue streams, including those from Cloud,     hardware, and YouTube subscription offerings. Cloud is one of     our most important strategic priorities given the scale of     opportunity in a rapidly evolving sector, and the fact that the     requirements for success align with many of our strengths. We     will continue to invest here for the long-term opportunity.     Similarly, hardware remains an exciting growth opportunity for     us, and you've seen the early indicators again this     quarter.All things considered, it's apparent that Alphabet is firing   on all cylinders, with multiple irons in the fire enabled by its   thriving advertising operations. With shares of Alphabet sitting   near an all-time high today, I think current investors should be   more than pleased with where their company stands.10 stocks we like better than Alphabet (A     shares)When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Google Roundup: Earnings, Android, Home, Earth, Uber Row, Gender Bias, YouTube;4/28/2017;"EarningsAlphabetGOOGLreported solid first-quarter results, wherein earnings of $7.73 blew past the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.24 while ex-TAC revenue of 20.12 billion also topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $19.65 billion. Revenue and earnings continued to grow strong double digits from the year-ago quarter.Since advertising remains its primary business (86% of gross total revenue), the strong report was largely a factor of prices (CPCs were down 19% because of strength in lower-margin mobile and Trueview ads), and paid clicks (that increased 44%). Encouragingly, Other revenue (including Google Play, hardware and Cloud) jumped 49.4% while Other bets (currently Nest, Verily and Fiber) revenues grew 47.9%.Management said that the much-talked-about ad pulling from YouTube didn't have an impact on results.AndroidSettlement with Russian Regulators: Google has reached a settlement with the Federal Anti-Monopoly Service (FAS) in Russia wherein it agreed to pay $7.8 million in fines and not demand exclusive pre-installation of its services on Android phones. This seems to indicate that the Russian authorities have allowed pre-installation of the Google bundle (so it can recover Android costs), but competing services like Yandex search can also be pre-installed, can appear on the first screen and users can choose their default search engine.This is actually not a bad deal at all, especially in the era of intelligent (including voice controlled) personal assistants that fetch you the information you're looking for either on the device or anywhere on the web.Android Overtakes Windows: Mainly because of the smartphone becoming the primary device to access the Internet, the secular decline in traditional PC sales and the emergence of Asia as the biggest market for connected devices, Android is now the most popular OS for connecting to the Internet. StatCounter says that in March 2017, Android garnered a 37.93% share of Internet usage compared to Windows' 37.91%.While Microsoft still dominates the desktop, there's evidence that Google's Chrome is the most popular browser. Google's Android and Chrome strategies remain hazy and with these stats there are now renewed speculations about their merger.Google HomeGoogle Home Assistant Recognizes Voices: The Google Home Assistant can now recognize up to six voices, provided they have been registered with it. The process involves speaking a few sentences that help the Assistant to create a voice profile to which it attaches all the mail, news, music etc that goes with that profile. Thereafter, whenever any of the six registered people ask for assistance, it will recognize the voice and provide the requested information.This is a very convenient feature that Google was the first to provide. But since the feature is only available on Pixels and the very latest Android phones, it will have very limited reach. AmazonAMZNoffers many useful features through Echo and Alexa although not this one, but it has significantly greater reach.Google Tests Voice Ads: ""By the way, Disney's live action Beauty and the Beast opens today,"" the Google Home smart speaker told people after giving them the time, weather and travel update as part of its ""My Day"" feature. Google said it wasn't an ad but speculation is running rife as everyone tries to figure out Google's monetization strategy for Home. ""We're continuing to experiment with new ways to surface unique content for users and we could have done better in this case,"" Google said by way of explanation.Google EarthGoogle Earth recently got a major new update. Searching for any location inside Earth surfaces not just detailed images of that place but also knowledge cards that tell you things about it, like history, points of interest etc.The newly introduced 3D button offers 3D images of 20K places along with their knowledge cards. The imaging is more real because it isn't picked up by a satellite but by hovering planes capturing the data that Google later stitches into 3D images.Most exciting is a feature it calls Voyager ( activated when you click a wheel icon) that takes you on guided tours of places including cities, forests, islands, and so forth. These tours (""stories"") have been created in partnership with scientists, storytellers and non-profits. Google currently has 50 stories available but plans to add more every week.For now, you need a Chrome browser of Android app to launch the app, but Google has promised to add support to other browsers and operating systems soon.Google YouTubeYouTube Top App on Apple App Store: A relaxation of the live streaming requirements apparently helped YouTube to the top position in Apple'sAAPLApp Store, reports Tech Crunch. Previously, users with at least 10,000 subscribers were allowed to live stream but YouTube recently brought down that number to a thousand. YouTube hasn't held this position since Dec 2015, according to App Annie.Ad Controversy: YouTube will host its Brandcast event on May 4, a marketing event at which it shares success stories while helping brands reach their targeted audiences. So any controversy at this time is bad for YouTube, because it can be used by brands to negotiate advantageous deals for themselves. And that's exactly what seems to be happening...Some time back, the UK government discovered that its ads were appearing next to inappropriate content and leading around 250 companies operating in the UK including L'Oreal and McDonald's to withdraw their UK ads from the platform. Although Google apologized and made changes to its ad platform giving more control to advertisers, big Fortune 500 companies like Pepsi,Starbucks,General MotorsGM,Wal-Mart, J&J, JPMorgan Chase, Ford, AT&TTand Verizon pulled their U.S. ads as well. Analysts currently estimate that the revenue hit could be anywhere between $750 million to a billion dollars.The main problem according to Moody's is the extremely high volumes (400 hours of video are uploaded to YouTube every minute) that make it very difficult to police the content. But because ads placed alongside content that doesn't correspond to the brand's positioning hurts the brand, Moody's thinks it's an objection well taken and would be credit negative.However, the agency says that these brands contribute relatively fewer dollars than the vast majority of YouTube advertisers that continue to spend on the platform and the pullback is in any case temporary because of measures taken by Google. Also, while Google's fix will increase costs related to investments in personnel, AI and machine learning to facilitate review of material being uploaded, this won't be significant enough to warrant a change in the current Aa2 investment rating.Bottom line: There are only two really big digital ad-serving platforms (FacebookFBand YouTube) that draw a very large number of users and it's advantageous for brands to be on both of them. Moreover, the controversy is an industrywide phenomenon with the problem not restricted to YouTube. So while YouTube can't take too hard a stand when negotiating with brands, it may not get pushed into a corner either; more so because it can also point to Google Preferred that offers access to the top 5% content on YouTube (at a premium of course).The bottom line impact will likely also be insignificant because Google is anyway investing in artificial intelligence and machine learning to improve and enhance its algorithms and search results.Google Cloud EventAt its Cloud Next conference in California last week, Google demonstrated that it finally has a big growth engine that isn't driven by the search services it is identified with. The cloud strategy has been unfolding over the past few years for both Microsoft and Google. But the companies have taken different approaches based on their existing strengths and weaknesses. In Google's case, its intentions became clear when it hired VMware founder Dianne Greene roughly 16 months ago.Greene has clearly worked to form, bringing in asteady flow of big clientsincluding Walt Disney, Home Depot, Apple and Snap. At the conference, Google announced HSBC, eBayEBAY, Colgate Palmolive and Verizon indicating the growing confidence in its platform.Google also announced a bigcollaboration with SAPthat will bring its enterprise applications to the Google Cloud Platform (GCP). This will benefit customers in many ways, giving them access to real-time insights based on big data and offload more complex tasks to GCP when constrained for memory. Within a couple of months, SAP will make its own cloud run on GCP and soon start offering G Suite products including Gmail and Google Calendar to its own customer base of more than 345,000 companies, including most of the world's top 2,000 firms.There were also some newenterprise-focused Google Drive toolsincluding Team Drives (allowing administrators to create, add and delete team members and assign permissions to them within a shared space that will retain shared files even when members change); Google Vault for Drive (that stores data on Google Drive for companies to export, search, hold and retain as required); Drive File Stream (already available for early adopters, this allows you to work directly with files on Drive using applications like Microsoft Word and Adobe Photoshop, which updates the changes automatically to Drive for access from any of your devices later); and Quick Access with Team Drives (that uses artificial intelligence based on an analysis of activity, interactions between colleagues, and workday patterns to serve the most relevant Google Drive files at any given time.And that's not all: Hangouts also got an enterprise version calledHangouts Chatthat could help with corporate communications.As far as acquisitions are concerned, the company announced a couple: AppBridge, which has a tool of the same name to facilitate migration of data (along with file permissions) from other storage solutions whether it's on-premise devices, cloud services, or hybrid solutions to Google Drive. The second was Kaggle, which hosts data and facilitates machine learning contests.Google-Uber Lawsuit DevelopmentsAlphabet's Waymo added a fourth patent that it says was infringed upon by Uber and furnished further details including the statement of an eye-witness in a fresh filing. The statement is from Pierre-Yves Droz, a former colleague and close confidant of Levandowski's (the ex-Googler who has allegedly run off with Waymo self-driving technology and trade secrets to form self-driving trucking company Otto, which was subsequently bought by Uber for $680 million). The lawsuit specifies the time at which Levandowski met Uber executives in Jan 2016, registering the company that would become Otto the following day. Waymo is seeking an injunction to prevent Uber from using the technology in its self-driving vehicles and seeking damages for any proven infringements.Uber says that since Google has in October, filed for private arbitration against Levandowski for violating confidentiality obligations in his contract to improperly recruit his Waymo colleagues to Otto and Uber, it should also move the allegations of trade-secret theft and unfair competition against Uber into arbitration. The logic is that since both these are related to Levandowski they should be handled similarly. Arbitration proceedings are private and also have different rules related to evidence, which could safeguard Uber's reputation. The company is willing to continue the patent infringement aspect of the case in court.Gender Inequality at GoogleThe U.S. Department of Labor (DoL) has made a sweeping statement that it had ""found systemic compensation disparities against women pretty much across the entire workforce"" and DOL Regional Director Janette Wipper said the agency had received ""compelling evidence of very significant discrimination against women in the most common positions at Google headquarters.In a detailed response to the allegation, Google's VP of people operations, Eileen Naughton said that the claims had been made ""without any supporting data or methodology."" She also explained the salary analysis system Google currently employs:""Each year, we suggest an amount for every employee's new compensation (consisting of base salary, bonus and equity) based on role, job level, job location as well as current and recent performance ratings…The analysts who calculate the suggested amounts do not have access to employees' gender data. An employee's manager has limited discretion to adjust the suggested amount, providing they cite a legitimate adjustment rationale."" The model then measures individual salary calculations against those received by their peers, which is done to eliminate ""statistically significant differences between men's and women's compensation"". Naughton also said that Google's methodology is available to other businesses if they want to test their own compensation practices for equal pay.This has been going on since Sep 2016, after which a case was filed in January, asking for Google's compensation data. Things came to a head after Google failed to comply with a routine audit.Google Wants to Invest In LGSouth Korea's Electronic Times reported that Google has offered to pay LG Display up to $880 million (one trillion KRW) as its contribution toward a production line for flexible OLED panels for use in second-generation Pixel phones. LG is considering the offer. Google's Pixel, which has the appearance and features of a premium device and has been marketed as such, will fall back in the race with Samsung and Apple on features if it doesn't get some OLED screens of its own. So Google's needs are clear. Google would also rather not get into a deal with Samsung, which uses OLED in its own phones and is also in an agreement to supply to Apple. So it's trying to find another supplier.Other NewsGoogle Building Ad Blocker for Chrome: Google could be putting up some real competition to ad blocking companies. It now intends to build an ad blocker into Chrome that would help users shut down pop up, auto play and such other annoying advertisements. What constitutes unacceptable adverts will then be decided by the Coalition for Better Ads (an independent group set up by a consortium of major advertisers and agencies in March to develop standards after ""comprehensive research"" involving more than 25,000 participants).While Google does derive the bulk of its revenue from ads, it has over the years framed guidelines and policies to ensure that ads weren't too intrusive. So if it does go ahead with the ad blocker, it wouldn't be opposed to its own policies. On the other hand, Google would be able to save the money it often has to dish out to ad blocking companies to whitelist ads (nice way of saying unblock). The news was reported by WSJ and is yet to be announced by the company.PayPal, Google Partner on Payments: The partnership allows Android Pay users to make payments using PayPal's app. This extends Android Pay's reach and makes Android Pay more useful. Since PayPal is growing closer to Google (it already uses the Google Cloud), this partnership renewed speculation that Google might acquire PayPal some time in the future.Payments Through Gmail: Google is extending the peer-to-peer payments service for Gmail users to the Gmail app for Android. Clicking on the attachments tab will now also throw up options to send or receive money with the funds then being transferred from one bank account to the other. The service will be directly pitted against PayPal's Venmo (although without its social aspect) and SquareCash.Smart Jackets with Levis: Google's Project Jaquard, which combines thin, metallic alloys with natural and synthetic yarns to create touch-sensitive interactive fabrics is finally inside smart jackets from Levi's. The jackets, which will allow you to skip songs, use Google maps and make phone calls by the brush of your sleeve, will sell for $350 from this fall.Data Highway with Facebook: The highest-capacity Internet link between Asia and the U.S. is about to be constructed by Chinese real estate magnate Wei Junkang's Pacific Light Data Communication Co (60% share), Facebook (20%) and Google (20%). American contractor TE SubCom will lay the 17-millimeter wide, 12,800-kilometer-long cable, which will in all probability be operational by late 2018.Google Fake News Fix: Similar to Facebook's ""disputed"" tag, Google has also decided to create groups called review teams to flag content they deem ""upsetting-offensive"". Some of the criteria Google's using to flag content would make you smile: ""high-quality"" pages could be the home page of a newspaper that has ""won seven Pulitzer Prize awards,"" and ""low-quality"" pages could be articles that include ""many grammar and punctuation errors."" Thankfully, the results will still show up, but with the flag.Google, Facebook Lead in Digital Ads: According to eMarketer, U.S. digital ad spending will increase 16% this year to $83 billion with Google and Facebook claiming the largest share by virtue of their strength in search and display, respectively. Google's overall share of digital ad spending will be 40.7% this year while Facebook's will be over 19%. Facebook is expected to continue growing much faster than Google off a smaller base.Google will dominate in search with a 78% share and Facebook in display with a 39% share. Twitter, which derives 89% of its total ad revenue from mobile, will for the first time see mobile ad revenue shrink, by 5%. Snapchat, which commands just 1.2% of the total U.S. mobile ad market, and just 4% of the total growth in U.S. digital advertising, will grow its ad revenue by 158% to $770 million.Sell These Stocks.

Sales jumped   22% to $24.75 billion and outpaced consensus estimates that were   targeting $24.2 billion. Profits blew past expectations as   earnings soared 28% to $7.73 per share. Wall Street would have   been happy with $7.40 per share of profit.The Google business continues to shine, with operating income   up 22% to $7.6 billion on surging advertising revenue. The   segment benefited from stellar results in a young hardware   segment that now includes the Google Home speaker and the Pixel   smartphone. These newer revenue streams joined the booming growth   in established areas like mobile search and YouTube to send   overall operating margin up a full percentage point to 27% of   sales.The company's Other Bets unit expanded its loss to $855   million from $774 million while boosting revenue by nearly 50% to   $244 million.Executives were happy with the operating trends and   telegraphed more aggressive spending on improving its search   platform while pushing deeper into the hardware business.

The company also managed an uptick in   profitability, with operating margin rising to 17.7% of sales   from 17.3%. As a result, earnings rose at a healthy 15% clip to   $0.45 per share.But Starbucks wasn't immune to the broader retailing slowdown   that's hurting peers across the industry.

Additionally, the company is   ""seeing further acceleration into April,"" Chief Financial Officer   Scott Maw explained in a press release.Those recent trends are giving executives confidence that   growth will speed up over the next two quarters to allow the   beverage giant to meet its long-term annual growth goals despite   industry challenges. Starbucks aims to boost sales by 10%   annually as earnings rise by 15% to 20%, but through the first   half of fiscal 2017, revenue is up just 6% and profit is running   14% higher.Offer from The Motley Fool: The 10 best stocks to buy nowMotley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more   than a decade beating the market.

3 Big Stock Charts for Friday: Alphabet Inc (GOOGL), Intel Corporation (INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD);4/28/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe market got a deluge of earnings reports from technology giants last night. Companies likeAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL),Amazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN),Intel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) andMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) all provided their quarterly results. In general, the numbers were great, but the market's reaction to the numbers haven't been completely consistent.makeArticleAd();Today's three big stock charts takes a look at the reaction toAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL) andIntel Corporation's(NASDAQ:INTC) results while looking forward to Monday's earnings release fromAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMD).Intel Corporation (INTC)Intel gave some good numbers to Wall Street yesterday as the company beat on the top and bottom line. The color on the quarter after the release gave investors a reason to sell as PC demand and a few other metrics weren't up to par.INTC stock is finding itself trading at a strong foundation of technical support that is likely to cause the chart watchers to step in and start buying.The 10 Best Stocks for the Next 1,361 Days of President Donald TrumpOutside of the simple round numbered support provided by $36, there are three major trendlines trading within a few cents of $36. This fortifies this price for Intel as short-term support.The critical 50- and 200-day moving averages are currently sitting at $35.90. The double-barreled support of these two indicators should be considerable as INTC stock works out the post-earnings selling.In addition, the 100-day moving average is just above $36, trading at 36.22. A move back above this trendline will confirm a hold of the 50- and 200-day and strengthen the intermediate-term outlook for the stock, drawing in more technical buyers.Shares of Intel have continued to lag the market; however, the 3% dividend is starting to make it more attractive as the interest rate environment has become hazy. For now, the chart is still friendly for bullish traders.Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD)In a perfect segue, Advanced Micro Devices announces their earnings on Monday after the market's close. AMD is trading 1.5% lower in sympathy to Intel's earnings results, but the stock may actually have more to lose given the chart.Unlike Intel, Advanced Micro Devices shares just got rejected by their 50-day moving average, which is rolling over. This transition alone puts AMD at risk as a the declining 50-day usually results in an increased probability that the stock will continue its decline.Support for AMD shares resides at an even $12 from the initial look at the chart. This is obviously from the round numbered nature of that price, but also a look back shows definite support and resistance from the technical activity over the last year.If $12 were to give way next week, which we are expecting to be the case, then technical traders will begin to eye $10 as the next level of solid support worthy of buying Advanced Micro Devices on a dip.  This price will have the stock deep in oversold territory as well as pressing against the stock's 200-day moving average.The move to this price would represent an incredible 35% decline from its highs for the year, another number that would get the technical traders excited as AMD stock would represent a heavy discount against other peer companies.Alphabet Inc (GOOGL)Alphabet shares are soaring after another great earnings report. Currently the stock is trading 4% higher and is avoiding some of the selling pressure that we are seeing on other companies that beat their numbers last night. This suggests that traders are letting their profits run instead of hitting the sell button on GOOGL.Apple Inc. (AAPL) iPhone Sales Fall Flat, China's Huawei Grabs Market ShareThis morning's move takes Alphabet further into new high territory as the stock breaks above $900 for the first time, which will gather more momentum.The move also breaks GOOGL shares well above their top Bollinger Band by a magnitude not seen in more than two years. This suggests two things. First, we will see some profit-taking within the next few weeks as this combines with an overbought reading on Alphabet stock. Second, and more bullish, is that the stock is likely to continue to see positive volatility movements (upside volatility).For now, the volatility and the trend remain very friendly for GOOGL shares.As of this writing, Johnson Research Group did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace7 Best Chinese Stocks to Buy on Renewed GrowthThe 10 Best Cheap Stocks to Buy for $10 or LessQualcomm, Inc.

Twilio Inc (TWLO) Stock Has More Upside to come;4/28/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTwilio Inc(NYSE:TWLO) took quite the roller coaster ride after its IPO almost ten months ago. TWLO stock, priced at $15, opened at $24, and closed its first day of trading at $29. By the end of September - barely three months after Twilio stock hit the public markets - TWLO traded above $70. The decline was swift, however. Within six weeks, TWLO stock hit $30, nearly completing a round-trip to its first-day closing price.makeArticleAd();Source:Web Summit Via FlickrSince then, TWLO stock has calmed significantly, and traded in a reasonable range. An upgrade from JPMorgan earlier this month has sparked a small rally in Twilio. But the stock still trades below half the highs reached last year.I don't expect TWLO to retake $70 any time soon - but I do see plenty of reason for near-term upside in the stock. With Twilio earnings due in early May, there's a potential upside catalyst ahead. And from a broader perspective, there are other drivers of what remains a strong growth story.Twilio's Performance Is Just FineThe mini-bubble in TWLO in late 2016 colors the perception of the stock. Somehow, because Twilio stock is about 55% off its highs, it seems disappointing.The 10 Best Stocks for the Next 1,361 Days of President Donald TrumpThat's not really the case, however. It's not Twilio's fault that investors bid up a low-float, high-growth issue soon after its IPO. A secondary offering announced in October certainly didn't help - but most of the proceeds went to shareholders, not the company itself. And it's not as if other companies haven't done the same thing: bothAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) andFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB), among many others, executed secondaries soon after their public offerings.If TWLO stock had priced at $15, closed its first day at $23, then risen to $35-$40 before a more modest retreat, TWLO would be considered just another growth stock, not damaged goods. And it's not as if Twilio's performance has driven the decline. The company beat estimates in both Q3 and Q4; and Twilio stock gained as a result.The fact that Twilio stock traded above $70 in October doesn't impact where Twilio stock is headed going forward. That rise and fall aside, Twilio has performed well - and that performance should continue.Twilio's Growth Will ContinueTWLO stock gets almost universal rave reviews from analysts. And it's not just the analysts involved in the IPO. Smaller shops without investment banking services - and thus the incentive to goose Twilio stock higher - have been positive as well. Those are the same type of firms who have expressed steady skepticism about theSnap Inc(NYSE:SNAP) IPO, largely on valuation concerns.Analysts aren't always right, of course. But the backing of the analyst community should help near-term trading, particularly out of earnings reports. Sympathetic analysts get the post-earnings story out the market. And the fact that the Street sees upside for Twilio does matter from a long-term standpoint as well. The average target price for TWLO stock is over $39, representing 20%-plus upside. That's a major gap for such a well-followed stock.Meanwhile, Twilio is growing - and should continue to grow. Revenue increased 60% in Q4, and 66% for the full year. The midpoint of 2017 guidance suggests another 33% increase in 2017. The company's integration withAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) and its Amazon Web Services unit provides a powerful growth driver going forward as well.Twilio isn't profitable, admittedly. The issuance of Twilio stock to employees and executives - some $24 million in 2016 alone - needs to be considered as well. But in 2017, the company should near non-GAAP profitability. And the nature of the SaaS model is that upfront near-term losses are booked in order to create high-margin recurring revenue down the line. As long as Twilio can continue its impressive top-line growth, the numbers will work. And with Amazon as a partner, and real need for the company's CPaaS offerings, that growth should continue.TWLO Stock Isn't Cheap - But It's Not Expensive, EitherEven at half price, Twilio stock is priced dearly, trading at over 6x the midpoint of 2017 revenue guidance on an enterprise basis.Why Starbucks Corporation (SBUX) Stock Is Running Out of AirBut that's not terribly out of place in the current software environment.Veeva Systems Inc(NYSE:VEEV) is at almost 10x forward revenue - despite lower current growth and an eventual limit driven by its focus on the life sciences industry.Splunk Inc(NASDAQ:SPLK) trades at a similar revenue multiple to Twilio stock, despite lower growth.Twilio stock has room to gain even at that high multiple - if revenue growth continues. And, again, there's little reason to see otherwise at the moment. TWLO stock isn't cheap - but investors generally have to pay up for quality. And post-IPO trading aside, this looks like a quality stock.As of this writing, Vince Martin had no positions in any securities mentioned.More From InvestorPlace7 Blue-Chip Stocks Every Investor Should OwnThe 10 Best Stocks to Buy for the Next DecadePlease Don't Act Surprised GoPro Inc (GPRO) Stock Didn't Surge After EarningsThe postTwilio Inc (TWLO) Stock Has More Upside to comeappeared first onInvestorPlace."

It has outperformed both PSI and XLK over the   past 10 years, with an 11% annual average gain.Earnings MomentumThe technology sector of the S&P 500 was expected to   report earnings growth of 16.2% in the first quarter, trailing   only the energy sector and ahead of the S&P 500's overall   9.7% growth, according to S&P Capital IQ consensus estimates   at the start of earnings season.Lindsey Bell, an investment strategist at CFRA Research,   pointed out that while energy is expected to bounce back from a   loss, technology is likely to be a growth leader for the third   quarter in a row.The semiconductor industry will likely drive Q1 tech earnings   with a projected 39.4% growth rate, she added.

The race to quadruple digits is heating up and will no doubt be an obsession for spectators in the coming days.On the technical front, GOOGL is firing on all cylinders. Really, what is there negative to say about a stock perched at all-time highs? The single feather in bears' hats is its overbought status. With this morning's flight, Alphabet shares have now risen about $100 in a little over two weeks.So, sure, we may see some profit-taking strike from weak longs looking to ring the register.

Intel (INTC) Beats on Q1 Earnings, Raises FY17 Guidance;4/28/2017;"Intel CorpINTCreported first-quarter 2017 non-GAAP earnings of 66 cents per share, which surged 22.2% from the year-ago quarter but declined 16.5% sequentially. Earnings per share (EPS) beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny.makeArticleAd();The strong year-over-year earnings growth was driven by 7.2% increase in revenues, which totaled almost $14.80 billion but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $14.81 billion. Revenues decreased 9.6% sequentially.The robust year-over-year revenue growth came on the back of impressive results from the Client Computing, Data Center and Internet-of-Things groups, which contributed to almost 87.4% of total revenue.Intel Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS     SurpriseIntel Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS   Surprise|Intel Corporation QuoteHowever, shares were down 3.55% in after-hour trading following the results. We note that Intel has underperformed the ZacksSemiconductor Generalindustry on a year-to-date basis. While the company's shares lost 0.9%, the industry gained 4.1%.We believe that first-quarter results demonstrated a turnaround in the company's businesses after a long time. The improving PC shipment data - as per Gartner and IDC - is positive for the company. The upcoming launch of Skylake is anticipated to benefit data center results in the second half, which management believes will help to drive high-single digit revenue growth in 2017.Intel revised up 2017 revenue and EPS outlook based on strong average selling price (ASP) in the Client Computing Group (although expected to decline slightly as compared with the first-quarter growth) and growth in the memory business. ASPs are expected to increase in the data center group through the rest of 2017.Further, anticipated improvement in cost structure and lower spending, primarily due to improving operational efficiency will aid in expansion of margins going forward. Additionally, aggressive share buyback will boost the bottom line in 2017.Despite the revenues miss and intensifying competition in most of the markets, we expect that these aforesaid factors will help Intel stock to rebound in the rest of 2017.Segment Revenue DetailsClient Computing Group(53.9% of revenues) - Intel bundles PCs, notebooks, 2-in-1s, tablets and other computing devices under the Client segment, which actually helps comparison with the PC market numbers provided by IDC and Gartner.Revenues increased 5.7% year over year but plunged 12.6% sequentially to almost $7.98 billion. The growth rate was encouraging as it continued to beat PC market trends. In fact, management still expects a mid-single digit percentage decline in the PC unit total addressable market (TAM).On a year-over-year basis, platform volumes decreased 4%, while platform ASP was up 7%. Desktop platform volumes were down 7% and desktop platform ASP was up 2%. Notebook platform volumes were up 1% and notebook platform ASP was up 7%. Sequentially, platform volumes decreased 13%, while platform ASP increased 2%.Data Center Group(28.6% of revenues) - Revenues increased 5.8% year over year but declined 9.3% sequentially to $4.23 billion. Platform volumes decreased 1%, while platform ASP was up 6% on a year-over-year basis. Sequentially, platform volumes decreased 7% and platform ASP fell 3%.Per Intel, the cloud service provider revenues advanced 18%. Enterprise was down 3%, while non-CPU adjacencies grew more than 20% across all of the segments.Management stated that it is on track to launch next-generation Skylake microprocessor, which is expected during mid-summer. The new processor is anticipated to deliver two-times improved performance in floating-point operations per clock over the current generation, which will support high performance computing (HPC) and artificial intelligence (AI) workloads.Notably, the company recently formed Artificial Intelligence Product Group, which comprises all AI hardware and software assets along with AI engineering expertise.We believe that growing demand for server chips that are used in the data centers from the cloud-based service providers like Amazon.comAMZN, AlphabetGOOGLand MicrosoftMSFTis a key catalyst for Intel.Internet of Things Group(4.4% of revenues) - Revenues jumped 10.8% from the year-ago quarter but declined 0.7% quarter over quarter to $721 million. The growth was backed by strength in industrial, video and automotive applications.During the quarter, Intel announced its plan to acquire Israel-based Mobileye, an autonomous vehicle technology provider, for a whopping $15.3 billion in an all-cash deal. The deal will help the company to fast penetrate the $70 billion autonomous driving systems, data and services market. (Read More:Intel Buys Mobileye to Boost Presence in Autonomous Cars)Non-Volatile memory solutions group(5.9% of revenues) - Revenues jumped 55.5% year over year and 6.1% sequentially to $866 million.During the quarter, Intel shipped its first Optane SSDs for the data center. Management stated that Optane memory solution is now available online and will be launched in PC OEM systems later this quarter.Programmable solutions group(2.9% of revenues) - The Altera business is now the Programmable Solutions Group, which increased 18.4% from the year-ago quarter and 1.2% sequentially to $425 million.Intel Security Group(3.6% of revenues) - Revenues dipped 0.6% year over year and 2.9% sequentially to $534 million. In early April, the company completed the divestiture of its majority stake in Intel Security division to alternative asset fund manager TPG. The newly spun-off unit has been renamed McAfee, with TPG holding 51% stake. (Read More:Intel Trims Business, Sells Majority Stake in Security Unit)Intel also has a residual segment, which includes results of operations from New Technology Group and other adjustments. The segment reported revenues of $42 million down 16% from the year-ago quarter and 35.4% on a sequential basis.Operating DetailsThe gross margin for the quarter was 63.2%, which expanded 10 basis points (bps) sequentially and 40 bps year over year, better than guided 63%. The year-over-year expansion resulted from the absence of Altera acquisition-related charges, lower platform unit costs, and higher platform ASP. This was partially offset by higher factory start-up costs (primarily on 10 nm) and unfavorable product mix.The sequential expansion in gross margin can be attributed to lower product warranty and IP charges.Research & development (R&D) and marketing, general & administrative (MG&A) increased 1.1% year over year and remained almost flat sequentially to $5.43 billion, higher than management's guided figure of $5.3 billion. As percentage of revenues, R&D and MG&A declined 220 bps on a year-over-year basis but increased 350 bps sequentially in the quarter.The operating margin was 26.5%, down 340 bps sequentially but up 270 bps year over year. Segment wise,Client Computing groupoperating margin were 38% as compared with 25% in the year-ago quarter. The massive expansion came on the back of lower investments and declining costs (14 nm). However, on a sequential basis, Client Computing group operating margin contracted 60 bps.Data Center groupoperating margin was 35.1%, as compared with 44.1% in the year-ago quarter and 40.3% in the previous quarter, primarily due to higher investments on product development.Internet of Things groupoperating margin was 14.6% as compared with 18.9% in the year-ago quarter and 25.1% in the previous quarter.Intel Security groupoperating margin expanded 200 bps on a year-over-year basis but declined 90 bps sequentially to 18.7%.Non-Volatile memory solutions groupreported loss of $129 million as compared with loss of $95 million in the year-ago quarter and $91 million in the previous quarter.Balance SheetCash, marketable securities and fixed income trading asset balance at quarter end was almost $17.30 billion, up $200 million from the previous quarter.Intel has $20.65 billion in long-term debt now as well as $4.63 billion in short-term debt, which has led to a net debt balance of $8.18 billion.During the reported quarter, Intel spend $2.0 billion on purchasing capital assets, paid dividends worth $1.2 billion and bought back shares worth $1.2 billion.Intel's board of directors approved an increase in its current share buyback program by $10 billion.GuidanceIntel guided second-quarter 2017 revenues of around $14.4 billion (+/-$500 million), almost flat sequentially and up 6% year over year. Excluding Intel Security Group business, revenues are projected to grow 11% on a year-on-year basis. The projected figure is better than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $14.30 billion.The non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be around 63% (+/-2%), flat sequentially. R&D and MG&A expenses are anticipated to come in at around $5.2 billion.Operating income is projected to be approximately $3.9 billion, while EPS is anticipated to be 68 cents (+/- 5 cents), up 15% on a year-over-year basis. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at 64 cents.For full-year 2017, management expects revenues of almost $60 billion, better than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $59.82 billion and up $500 million from previous expectation of flat year-over-year revenue.Gross margin is anticipated to be 63% (+/-2%), which remain unchanged from the previous expectation.R&D and MG&A expenses are anticipated to come in at around $20.5 billion. Intel expects to reduce spending as a percentage of revenues by ""2 points from 2015 to 2017"". Over the long term, the company targets operating expense of 30% of total revenue. Intel expects to reach this target not later than 2020.Operating income is projected to be approximately $17.3 billion (up from $17.1 billion), while EPS is now anticipated to be $2.85 (+/- 5 cents) up from previous guidance of $2.80 and an anticipated increase of 5% over 2016.For the data center group, management expects operating margin to touch the lower end of its long-term guidance range of 40-45% in 2017. The company expects product costs to improve due to the transition from 22 to 14 nm, which is likely boost margins.Moreover, Intel expects the memory segment to report profits by the end of 2018.Full-year capex is now expected to be $12 billion (+/-$500 million) up $2.4 billion from 2016.Zacks RankCurrently, Intel carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy)   stocks here.Zacks' Hidden TradesWhile we share many recommendations and ideas with the public, certain moves are hidden from everyone but selected members of our portfolio services.

Takeaways From Tech Earnings: GOOG, AMZN, MSFT, EXPE, INTC, SBUX;4/28/2017;"Mega tech companies such as Google parent Alphabet (GOOG:GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), and Microsoft (MSFT) all reported earnings for the first quarter of the calendar year 2017, along with Expedia (EXPE), Intel (INTC) and some other, less techy companies such as Starbucks (SBUX). The results taken together had some broad implications, and individually revealed some solid opportunities.From a broad perspective, the earnings numbers, even of the companies that seemed somewhat disappointing, proved a point. A couple of days ago Iwrote herethat while there were signs of problems with some delayed IPOs in the tech sector, the fact that the Nasdaq is above 6k should not be a cause for worry.“This time” I wrote “is different...” and if you had any doubts about that, yesterday afternoon should have removed them completely. What is different now as opposed to the year 2000 is that the record highs are not being driven by speculation or unbounded optimism, but by rapidly increasing profits from companies listed on the exchange.makeArticleAd();In part that change is simply down to maturity. Nasdaq started life as an exchange in 1971 and in 2000 was still the young upstart where the companies of the future, rather than the established firms, listed their stock. A booming Nasdaq index at that time indicated unbounded optimism about the future and a belief that at some point in the future tech would be big business.As we know all too well that was an accurate, if slightly premature prediction, and now those same companies have become money making machines. The record highs in the index simply reflect record profits, with multiples of future earnings that are actually quite conservative given current growth rates.Probably the most impressive report yesterday was from Alphabet, which recorded a beat of expectations on the bottom line (EPS of $7.73 vs. $7.78) and a massive beat in terms of revenues ($24.75 billion vs. $19.78 billion). Those are spectacular numbers, but what really stood out in the release was the fact that, despite some issues with aboycott by advertisersof YouTube, revenue grew around twenty two percent year on year. The signs are that Google are dealing with the advertisers’ issues but even without that revenue, this was a remarkable number.The law of large numbers as it applies to companies should, one would expect, be coming into play here. It is not too hard to increase revenue from say $100 million to $120 million, but once a certain size is reached, improving on the previous year by billions at a time to maintain double digit percentage growth should be virtually impossible. Obviously Google is unaware of just how hard that should be and they continue to do it, and for that reason, if no other, GOOGL still looks like a steal, even at record highs.Another company to report good results was Intel (INTC), but here the market reaction rather than the numbers themselves is what creates the opportunity. The chip maker matched expected revenues, beat expected earnings, raised year end guidance and tripled the size of their share buyback program.Normally that combination would be seen as extremely positive, but due to a high whisper number and therefore significant recent gains in the stock that had left many traders long, INTC dropped around four percent immediately after the release. Those factors, however, are very short term and it is reasonable to expect a rapid recovery in INTL and further appreciation in the coming months.A similar story came out of Microsoft (MSFT)’s earnings, where they reported roughly in line revenue and a beat on the bottom line, but again shares traded lower in the aftermarket yesterday. This too is probably the result of inflated, maybe even unrealistic expectations, and overlooks the most encouraging thing about the report. Sure, sales of hardware products were a bit disappointing but the cloud services division which CEO Satya Nadella has made a priority is showing robust growth. Once again, early weakness looks like an opportunity more than anything.Returning to a broad based overview, one thing is clear from yesterday’s rash of high profile tech earnings. The sector is doing fine and, despite being massive already, continues to grow. The natural caution that results from history and from the impressive size of the sector, however, means that there are still plenty of investing opportunities, and investors should not hesitate to take them."

Amazon's Cloud Business Continues to Overshadow E-Commerce;4/28/2017;"Surprising no one,Amazon.com's (NASDAQ: AMZN) Amazon Web Services (AWS) business continues to   be the main headliner for earnings releases.Revenue in the first quarter came in at $35.7 billion, which   became $1.48 in earnings per share by the time it reached the   bottom line. Both top- and bottom-line results handily beat the   Street's expectations, which called for $35.3 billion in sales   and earnings per share of $1.08. On a trailing-12-month (TTM)   basis, operating cash flow also jumped 53% to $17.6 billion while   free cash flow rose to $10.2 billion. Still, Amazon's financial   results are increasingly all about AWS.Image source: Amazon.makeArticleAd();One of these is not like the othersAWS generated $3.6 billion in sales during the quarter,   bringing in $890 million in operating income. That's more than   Amazon's consolidated operating income, underscoring how   important the cloud infrastructure business remains to the   company's bottom line. This isn't new -- it's really just more of   the same. But for reference, here's each segment's operating   profitability.SegmentQ1 2016 Operating MarginQ1 2017 Operating MarginNorth America (e-commerce)3.5%2.8%International (e-commerce)(1.2%)(4.3%)AWS23.5%24.3%Data source: Amazon.If anything, AWS will only become even more important,   considering the fact that AWS is now starting to enjoy operating   leverage, which you can see by the modest operating margin   expansion. However modest that growth is, at least it's heading   the right direction; the core e-commerce businesses both saw   operating margins decline.Data source: SEC filings. Chart by author.AWS is also growing the fastest, and considering the fact that   those sales are far more profitable, it's a good time to be an   Amazon investor. Sure, revenue growth is decelerating, but that's   a natural function of any growing business coming off a small   base. It's not like shareholders are in a position to complain   about 43% revenue growth for AWS, particularly as Amazon shares   are now at all-time highs.What comes nextMeanwhile, cloud infrastructure is going to get a whole lot   more competitive, as bothAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) andMicrosofthave both placed high priority on their cloud businesses. It's   not insignificant that Google Cloud beat out AWS for themassiveSnapdeal, especially since Snap's embrace of third-party infrastructure   isunique in its scale.AWS will serve as Snap's backup, but you can't help but wonder   what Amazon's competitive response will be given its   characteristic aggression. We do know that Snap has committed to   spending $50 million at AWS this year, although that amount pales   in comparison to the $400 million that Snap has committed to   Google Cloud.For the second quarter, Amazon expects sales in the range of   $35.25 billion to $37.75 billion, which includes a negative   impact of $720 million related to foreign exchange headwinds.   Operating income should be $425 million to $1.1 billion, which at   the midpoint would be down 42% from a year ago as Amazon   continues to invest heavily in future growth.

Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM) Stock Delivers Despite Low Oil Prices;4/28/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIn a world where oil is fighting to hold $50 per barrel, despite production cuts by OPEC,Exxon Mobil Corporation(NYSE:XOM) is a stock you buy for income, not capital appreciation or growth.makeArticleAd();Source:Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified)Still, the quarter ending in March was a pretty good one for Exxon, withearnings of 95 cents per shareon revenue of $63.3 billion. This was well past the earnings estimate of 85 cents, and even beat the ""whisper number"" of93 cents.As a result, the shares were rising in the pre-market, approaching $82.50 per share.The company's board presaged good news by hiking the dividend 2 cents per share,to 77 cents, on Apr 26. This brought the stock's yield up to 3.8%.The dividend had not been sustained by earnings since 2015 but helped keep the stock price from collapse, as the company's revenues have marched straight down,with the price of oil, from $421 billion in 2014 to $218 billion in 2016. Despite the dividend, the shares are down 8% so far in 2017.Good News for XOM Stock!The best news in the release is that the dividend is now fully supported by earnings, a 95 cent per share profit easily beating the 77 cents per share payout.The 10 Best Stocks for the Next 1,361 Days of President Donald TrumpThe language of the press release, however, was that of a company desperate for growth. ""New discovery, strategic acquisitions and key initiatives position company for growth."" If you've got it, you don't have to flaunt it. Exxon is not accustomed to having it.There are some things to brag about in the report. XOM's earnings more than doubled from a year earlier to $4.01 billion from $1.80 billion a year ago. But earnings rose in part because of a big drop in capital spending, to $4.189 billion from $5.127 billion. Lower spending, in other words, representing half the profit gain.Exxon earned more money despite pumping less oil, the equivalent of 4.2 million barrels per day, down 4%, thanks to the fact that crude prices bounced off their early 2016 low of barely $30 per barrel and mostly bounced around $50 per barrel during the quarter.That is unlikely to be the case over the next year. The price may hold $50 per barrel, it may even go up, but it's unlikely to rise by two-thirds as it did.Exxon Opening the WalletIf earnings are to grow, it will be because Exxon Mobil is opening its vaults and spending to increase production. The release highlighted moves to secure new supplies off Guyana, Cyprus, Papua New Guinea and Mozambique, as well as Texas, and said it will be increasing production of high-quality lubricants at its Singapore refinery.Separately it has announced it is building a giant new chemical plant near Corpus Christi, Texas,with Saudi partners. The company is pushing the marketing of its Mobil 1 oils and making small investments in algae-based fuels that can be promoted on TV commercials.The Bottom Line for XOMThe beat on earnings should take Exxon out of the bargain bin, lowering the yield on the new dividend. It is unlikely to renew speculative fever in the stock, which depends on oil prices moving up from their present level.Without higher oil prices, which fuel inflation as well as earnings, there is little reason to own XOM stock beyond income. Despite its extensive operations in refining and selling products, as well as its chemicals production, Exxon earnings remain tied to the price of oil, what it calls its ""upstream"" operations.Apple Inc. (AAPL) iPhone Sales Fall Flat, China's Huawei Grabs Market ShareWhile analyst ratings are subject to change, more were telling customers to sell than buy the stock going into earnings. The fact that earnings now cover the dividend is promising, the rise in the dividend is welcome, and those who held the stock through the downturn now have a reason to believe there are better times ahead.But better times are not boom times.Dana Blankenhornis a financial and technology journalist.

Yet again, Google's parent put out a strong quarterly earnings report rife with growth, and GOOGL is popping Friday morning to extend its double-digit 2017 run.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockIt's simple: The core search engine business is driving user activity, which in turn is attracting online advertisers. We'll get into the details, but right now, that premise alone is driving Alphabet shares ever closer to the $1,000 mark.Alphabet Earnings By the NumbersAlphabet reported first-quarter revenues that shot 22% higher year-over-year to $24.75 billion. Net income climbed 28% to $7.73 per share. Both figures smashed estimates of $24.22 billion and $7.39 per share, respectively.GOOGL generated a 27% operating margin despite jacking up its headcount from 64,115 to 73,992.Google segment, advertising and properties were the three top contributors to revenue, and they more than offset the loss of $855 million in the ""Other Bets"" division. Investors may excuse Alphabet's weakest division by revenue, though - Alphabet's advancements in artificial intelligence, mobile and its internet search moat should ensure continued profit growth.Amazon.com, Inc.

It also lowered cost-per-click.GOOGL Stock Still Is a Reasonable ValueDespite the YouTube ad customer exodus over the quarter, Alphabet's revenues managed to exceed the consensus easily. And looking forward, analysts expect 30% earnings growth, implying a forward P/E of roughly 23.Growth investors should have no problems justifying a buy in GOOGL stock at that kind of P/E. Google is the dominant search engine on desktop and mobile, and advertisers have no choice but to spread budget between it andFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB).While the YouTube division might be hurting right now, a fix to its systems that allows more targeted advertising - away from the hate speech and other questionable content that sent advertisers packing in the first place - will set things right.Business Beyond AdvertisingAlphabet knows that the company faces significant risks if it relies solely on advertising revenue for growth. It is even keeping the online advertising business clean bycutting out poor-quality advertisers.Building an ad-blocker and enabling it by default may hurt Google's business. Yet by weeding out advertisers who push poorly designed ads, everyone benefits. Auto-playing videos consume bandwidth and slows down web page load times. Pop-ups hurt the user-experience.Still, Chrome browser users should not assume Alphabet is completely altruistic. The company may still track user behavior, selling that data to the highest bidder.Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock Slumps After Merely OK Q3 EarningsGoogle's inclusion of the ad blocker also will hurt third-party providers of the same service. This eliminates them from the competition, leaving only Google as the provider of ad-blocking services.Takeaway on AlphabetAlphabet recorded a solid quarter that justifies the 12%-plus gains in GOOGL stock, and apparently a little more, if today's pop is any indication.Investments in its own business and innovating on the advertising algorithm, search and Android, the mobile operating system, are all paying off. If Alphabet continues growing the business at this pace, the stock could easily reach $1,000 per share by the end of this year.Maybe some profit-taking ofApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) shares will help GOOGL reach that landmark first.As of this writing, Chris Lau did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceThe 10 Best Stocks for the Next 1,361 Days of President Donald Trump5 Bargain Stocks to Buy After Others Sell in May and Go Away10 Dividend Stocks That Will Deliver Double-Digit Returns Every YearThe postAlphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Hits All-Time Highs on All-Star Q1appeared first onInvestorPlace."

Sales in the quarter amounted to $23.56 billion, just a smidge higher than the Zacks consensus was looking for.

Amazon (AMZN) Beats Earnings and Revenue Estimates in Q1;4/28/2017;"Amazon.com'sAMZNfourth-quarter 2016 earnings per share (EPS) of $1.48 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.03.Also, revenues of $35.71 billion exceeded the consensus mark of $35.39 billion. The stock was up 1% in response to the higher-than-expected first-quarter earnings. Strong cloud computing sales, higher revenues from advertising and media streaming services also drove results.In the last one year, the stock outperformed the Zacks Electronic Commerce industry. While the stock returned 44.5%, the industry gained 40.7%.Though the North America and international segments were down in the last quarter, they improved from the year-ago quarter. Improvements in AWS were drven by operating efficiencies and increased utilization of assets.RevenuesAmazon reported revenues of $35.71 billion, down 18.4% sequentially but up 22.6% from the year-ago quarter. Quarterly revenues were above the guidance range of $33.25-$33.75 billion.Both product and service sales were down sequentially but up year over year. Service sales grew a lot stronger than product sales from the year-ago quarter (up 40.2% compared with product sales growth of 15.3%). Revenue distribution between the two was 66%/34%.Segment DetailsTheNorth Americasegment accounted for around 59% of sales, representing a sequential decrease of 20% but a year-over-year increase of 23.5%.TheInternational segmentaccounted for 31%, down 20.8% sequentially but up 15.6% year over year.TheAWS segmentwas up 3.5% sequentially and a massive 42.7% year over year with revenue share at nearly 10%. AWS is gaining momentum with customers including McDonald's, Workday, Capital One, Salesforce, GE Oil & Gas, Kellogg's, Brooks Brothers, Ferrara Candy Company, GPT Group, Hoya Corporation, Lionsgate, Macmillan Publishers India, RWE Czech Republic, and Bart & Associates Inc. Amazon remains the cloud infrastructure leader, well ahead of MicrosoftMSFT, International Business Machines CorporationIBMand AlphabetGOOGL.Gross MarginGross margin was up 337 basis points (bps) sequentially and 194 bps year over year to 37.2%.Sequential variations in gross margin were largely mix-related, although increased investments were also a factor. Growth in AWS had a positive impact on margin. Pricing is also an important factor, given the increase in product categories all over the world and Amazon's strategy of heavily discounting products and services while building position in any market. Third party sites did better than retail, which was also a positive.Net income was down 3.3% sequentially but up 41.1% year over year.Operating PerformanceAmazon's operating expenses of $12.3 billion were down 9.3% sequentially but up 33.5% from the year-ago quarter. Amazon's heavy investing activities (headcount, fulfillment centers, content, etc) over the past few quarters have been pushing up its costs.The net result was an operating margin of 2.8%, down 6 bps sequentially and 86 bps from the year-ago quarter. Amazon reported an operating profit of $1 billion compared with $1.3 billion in the previous quarter and $1.1 billion in the year-ago quarter.Net IncomeAmazon generated first-quarter net income of $724 million, or 2% of sales, compared with $749 million, or 1.7% in the previous quarter and $513 million, or 1.8% of sales in the same quarter last year. There were no one-time items in the fourth quarter. Therefore, the GAAP EPS was the same as the pro forma EPS of $1.48 compared with $1.54 in the previous quarter and $1.07 in the year-ago quarter.Balance Sheet and Cash FlowAmazon ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance of $21.53 billion, down $4.45 million from the prior quarter.The company used $1.59 billion of cash from operations, spending $1.86 billion on fixed assets (including internal-use software and website development costs) and $45 million on acquisitions. Principal repayments of capital lease obligations were $832 million in the first quarter.GuidanceManagement provided guidance for the second quarter of 2017. Revenues are expected to include a $720 million or 240 bps negative FX impact and come in around $35.25-37.75 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $36.92 billion. Operating income is expected to come in at approximately $425 million-$1.075 billion.To ConcludeRetail: Amazon's retail business remains very hard to beat on price, choice, convenience, you name it. The company has a solid loyalty system in Prime and its FBA strategy, and content addition continues to add selection to Prime memberships. If Amazon is able to replicate its domestic success internationally, investors could see far more growth. At the moment, international contributes a third of revenues but generates just a fraction of profits.AWS: Amazon Web Services, on the other hand, is the cash cow for Amazon. The business generates higher margins than retail, so it has a positive impact on Amazon's profitability. We remain optimistic about the functionality, partner ecosystem and the experience AWS offers and believe this will lead to continued customer wins.IoT: Amazon has converted the nascent smart home market into a potential area of growth, in a very short time, backed by its Alexa-powered Echo devices. With third-party partnerships, Amazon is making Alexa the central point of connecting IoT devices used in any household. It appears that Echo is well poised to penetrate every stream of business on the back of Amazon's robust performance.The company has accelerated signing on third-party device makers so that these companies integrate Amazon's voice assistant, Alexa, which brings them into the respective eco systems.Currently, Alexa is equipped with thousands of skills and can connect to any stream of business. We believe that Amazon has just started unfolding what it could do with Alexa.Amazon.com, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS     SurpriseAmazon.com, Inc.

Alphabet (GOOGL) Beats Earnings & Revenue Estimates in Q1;4/28/2017;"Alphabet'sGOOGLfirst-quarter earnings of $7.73 exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.24. Also, earnings were up 2.2% sequentially and 28.4% year over year.Following strong first-quarter earnings, share price jumped 4.27% to $929.5 in after-hours trading. Also, a surge in ad click aided growth in the quarter.Coming to the price performance, in the last one year, shares of Alphabet steadily treaded higher. The stock returned 31.8% compared with the Zacks categorizedInternet Servicesindustry's gain of 17.1%.On the Other Bets front, most of the businesses included there are in early stages. However, it is gradually picking up.The main drivers of the Google business haven't changed. Pricing remains under pressure both on account of nagging FX concerns as well as continued strength in mobile and TrueView. However, volumes are encouraging as total paid click growth of 44% remains a reassuring number.Google continues to enjoy strength on the mobile platform. One of the drivers is Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP), which is being accepted by a number of publishers and sites across the world covering more than 700,000 domains. Management is focused on driving mobile experiences and the company is well positioned to pick up strong intent-to-buy signals by studying mobile searches from its huge data base. As a result, direct response marketers continue to show interest in it.Google also mentioned messaging as an important addition to its product line in the form of Allo (mobile messaging) and Duo (video messaging) to further drive user experience. Also, the company said that Google Cloud is generating substantial revenue growth, reflecting the ongoing momentum in the business.The company has greater control on the browser through Android as well as distribution agreements with Apple. However, the upcoming threats should not be ignored. Apple may not renew its agreement; MicrosoftMSFTWindows 10 could steal overall search market share; FacebookFBgraph search and the social network could take away advertising dollars; and AmazonAMZNalready takes care of most product searches.Management said that YouTube remains a strong contributor benefiting from growth in online video consumption. More than a thousand creators are currently engaged with the platform, bringing in a thousand subscribers every day. The company also said that problems such as an advertiser boycott of YouTube did not have much impact on the quarter's results.Finally, Google platforms like Android, Chrome and Daydream continue to help it in drawing more users and selling more ads.The Numbers in DetailRevenuesGross total revenue of $24.8 billion was down 5% sequentially but up 22.2% year over year (up 24% in constant currency or CC). The year over year increase was primarily driven by strength in core advertising business.Google SegmentThe segment includes search, advertising, Play, hardware and Cloud & Apps.Coming to the search business, revenues from Google-owned sites declined 3.1% on a sequential basis, while that from partner sites decreased 9.5%, resulting in a total advertising revenue decline of 4.4%. However, Google-owned sites and partner sites grew 21.5% and 8.6%, respectively, year over year, and brought in 70% and 16% of quarterly revenues.Management said that mobile search continued to benefit from improvements in ad formats and delivery initiated in the third quarter of 2015 as well as remained optimistic about search revenue growth on both tablets and desktops.Other revenue decreased 9.1% sequentially but increased 49.4% year over year to account for 12.5% of first-quarter revenue.Other Bets SegmentAlphabet broke out the segment in the March quarter of 2016. The segment includes Fiber, Verily, Calico, Nest and incubation activities in X Labs. Revenues were down 6.9% sequentially but up 47.9% year over year.Since this segment is a combination of several businesses that are in the pre-revenue stage, operating different models and serving diverse end markets, the results are likely to be soft in any given quarter.Total traffic acquisition cost, or TAC(the portion of revenue shared with Google's partners and amounts paid to distribution partners and others who direct traffic to the Google website) was down 4.5% sequentially and 22.2% year over year.TAC paid out to network partners was down 8.4% sequentially but up 9.8% year over year. Mobile search carries higher TAC so the increase in mobile search revenue is driving related TAC according to management.TAC for distribution arrangements was up 2.2% sequentially and 48.3% year over year.Net advertising revenue, excluding TAC was down 4.4% sequentially but up 17.9% year over year.Revenue net of TAC came in at $20.12 billion, down 5.2% sequentially but up 22.2% year over year. The top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $19.65 billion.MarginsGross margin of 60.4% increased 133 bps sequentially but was down 182 bps from the year-ago quarter.Price declines remained negative in both sequential and year-over-year comparisons as the mix continued to move toward lower-margin business.Cost per click (CPC) was down a respective 4% and 19% from the previous and year-ago quarters. On a sequential basis, CPC was down 3% on Google sites and 9% on network sites. On Google sites, CPCs were down 21% from the year-ago quarter, while network CPC declined 17%.Paid clicks grew 2% sequentially and 44% year over year, driven partly by growing volumes of mobile and TrueView ads on YouTube. Google sites paid clicks grew 1% and 53%, respectively, from the previous and year-ago quarters, while Network paid clicks also increased 6% sequentially and 10% from the year-ago quarter.Operating expenses of $8.39 billion decreased 4.3% sequentially but up 15.4% year over year. The operating margin was 26.5%, up 107 bps sequentially and 17 bps from the year-ago quarter.Alphabet reported net income of $5.43 billion compared with $5.33 billion in the previous quarter and $4.21 billion in the year-ago quarter. GAAP earnings of $7.73 per share were down from $7.56 in the previous quarter but up from $6.02 in the year-ago quarter.Balance SheetAlphabet has a solid balance sheet, with cash and short-term investments of around $92.44 billion, up $6.11 billion from the fourth quarter. The company generated around $9.55 billion ofcash from operations in the first quarter and spent $2.51 billion on capex, netting a free cash flow of $7.04 billion.Alphabet also spent $101 million on acquisitions and $18 million to repay some debt.Alphabet Inc.

Big Tech Q1 Earnings Spigot Opens: AMZN, GOOGL, INTC, MSFT;4/27/2017;"The biggest reporting day of Q1 earnings season so far caps off with four of the biggest big tech players reporting: AmazonAMZN, MicrosoftMSFT, IntelINTCand AlphabetGOOGL. As we've seen in other sectors during this earnings season, positive surprises on the headline numbers continue to abound.makeArticleAd();Internet of Things giant (and one-company wrecking ball of big-box retail) Amazon.com has released an earnings beat directly after the closing bell today to $1.48 per share on quarterly sales of $35.7 billion. These figures favorably compare to the $1.03 per share and $35.39 billion expected in the Zacks consensus estimate. Amazon Web Services (AWS), now the company's most profitable business, brought in $3.6 billion for the quarter, which is in-line with expectations. Amazon shares are up 5% in the post-market to fresh all-time highs.For more, click here.Intel beat earnings estimates by a penny to 66 cents per share on $14.8 billion in Q1 revenues, which is basically in-line with estimates. Demand in high-performance computing is what Intel's top brass is chalking this up to. This marks at least the fifth straight earnings beat for Intel, though by a slimmer margin this time around.Software behemoth Microsoft posted a 4-cent beat for its fiscal Q3 earnings to 73 cents per share. Sales in the quarter amounted to $23.56 billion, just a smidge higher than the Zacks consensus was looking for. Guidance for upcoming quarters and full years will be addressed in the upcoming earnings call. Microsoft is pleased with the gains it has made in the cloud space recently.Search engine king Google's holding company Alphabet posted a big beat on the bottom line: $7.73 per share, where analysts were looking for $7.24.

Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock Is a “Stay Away!” on Q1 Earnings Beat;4/27/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) reported fiscal first-quarter earnings on Thursday after the bell, and based solely on operating metrics, things are going swimmingly. The valuation of AMZN stock is another matter, but I'll get to that later on.makeArticleAd();Source:Atomic Taco Via FlickrFor now, there's a lot to digest.Amazon Q1 EarningsThe headline numbers? Amazon earned $1.48 per share on revenues of $35.71 billion. Both figures beat estimates for $1.13 per share in profits and $35.3 billion in sales.However, the first thing I want to address is what I consider to be the most important metric for AMZN stock: operating cash flow. It went through the roof, up 53% to $17.6 billion for the TTM, from $11.6 billion for the previous TTM.Why is this metric so important? Because there's just no easy way to value AMZN stock. However, Amazon shares many similarities with the businesses owned by John Malone of The Liberty Media Corporation. GAAP accounting is so complex with his many businesses, spin-offs, tracking stocks and complex tax maneuvers that operating cash flow is what really determines the true health of the businesses.The 10 Best Stocks for the Next 1,361 Days of President Donald TrumpI think the same is true for Amazon stock. So when we see a huge increase in operating cash flow, that's great news. It's even better when we see that free cash flow increased to $10.2 billion for the trailing 12 months, compared with $6.7 billion for the previous TTM.If you back out lease principal payments and and assets acquired under capital leases - just so you have a complete picture - FCF still increased to $3.3 billion from $1.9 billion.What this tells us is that AMZN continues to be a cash machine, and it's one reason why the market probably rewards it as it does. Obviously, that cash flow can come from either increased sales, lower expenses, or both. Sales continue to be on fire, up 23% to $35.7 billion compared to $29.1 billion.However, operating income fell 6% to $1 billion in the first quarter. That tells us that Amazon continues to spend a lot of money expanding.Should we be concerned about this?The Growth of AmazonAgain, I think this is where Amazon earnings break the mold, and AMZN itself should be viewed more as a business development company crossed with venture capital crossed with John Malone.If you look at the ""highlights"" section of the press release, you see that Amazon has its hands in everything. I mean, there's now""Echo Look,""which allows Alexa to critique your style choice for the day. You can shop via voice command with Alexa. In fact, Alexa can now accomplish some 12,000 tasks - except it probably can't provide a fair value price for Amazon stock.It continues to expand Amazon Fresh - now in Tokyo, London and 21 other U.S. cities. It now has a private label fashion line. AMZN is taking India by storm, and is now the fastest growing marketplace there. In addition, it's producing tons of Indian content for streaming.Don't even talk to me about Amazon Web Services (AWS), which takes up more than half of the highlights in the press release. More and more large companies are migrating to the service, amidst a dozen other highlights.Should You Buy AMZN Stock?So back to the ultimate question: What do we do about this stock?Net income was $724 million in the first quarter, or $1.48 per share, compared with net income of $513 million, or $1.07 per share. Does that mean we can give AMZN a 40x P/E? As I've said before, net income is not how you value AMZN, and if you did, its P/E ratio is closer to 160.Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock Slumps After Merely OK Q3 EarningsWe talked about cash flow, so the closest metric I can give it EV-to-EBITDA, which is 36. I valueHSN, Inc.(NASDAQ:HSNI) the same way and it's at a ratio of 9. Same withLiberty Interactive Group(NASDAQ:QVCA), also at 9.The Liberty SiriusXM Group(NASDAQ:LSXMA) is at 11.5.Liberty Global PLC(NASDAQ:LBTYA) is also at 9.Now, because Amazon is growing faster than all of these, I would not hesitate to give AMZN stock a ratio of 20, or even 25. But at 36, things seem stretched.Coupled with the fact that this market is insanely overvalued, I say wait until the big correction comes,thendive in.Lawrence Meyers is the CEO of PDL Capital, a specialty lender focusing on consumer finance.

Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock Slumps After Merely OK Q3 Earnings;4/27/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe market clearly felt confident thatMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) was going to (proverbially) deliver the goods in its fiscal Q3 report. MSFT stock rallied more than 35% over the course of the past 12 months, and held on to those gains heading into Thursday evening's announcement.makeArticleAd();Source:Via MicrosoftAll told, analysts were expecting the company to turn $23.44 billion worth of revenue into a profit of 69 cents per share. Both projections were up from the profit of 62 cents per share and $22.08 billion worth of sales posted in the comparable quarter from a year earlier.Those traders weren't entirely wrong to expect good results. Microsoft ended upearning 73 cents per share, topping estimates. Revenue of $23.56 billion came up shy of estimates, though, sending MSFT stock down 2.0% in after-hours trading Thursday afternoon.CEO Satya Nadella commented on the third quarter numbers: ""Our results this quarter reflect the trust customers are placing in the Microsoft Cloud. From large multi-nationals to small and medium businesses to non-profits all over the world, organizations are using Microsoft's cloud platforms to power their digital transformation.""Despite traders' knee-jerk response to the report, Nadella was right about the number of customers Microsoft is garnering with its cloud products.Microsoft Earnings in FocusThe past couple of years haven't been bad ones for the iconic organization. But, they've not been great ones either. Sales continued to grow in 2015, but income slumped on a year-over-year basis. Profits turned for the better last year, though revenue was off.The 10 Best Stocks for the Next 1,361 Days of President Donald TrumpThe inconsistency of the company's results largely marked a transition for Microsoft, away from installed software and hardware-centric services to cloud-based products… largely in response to rivaling services from the likes ofAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) andAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL). Amazon is thecurrent market leader in the cloud computing market, though Google's offering has a respectable following.The paradigm shift prompted a complete redivisioning of the company, to better reflect how Nadella intends for Microsoft to do business going forward. The three primary arms are now Productivity and Business Processes, Intelligent Cloud, and More Personal Computing. Those units reflect, respectively, the company's Office software suite, servers and the Azure interface/platform, and Windows/Xbox.All three divisions saw much-needed growth in the second fiscal quarter of 2017, ending in December. But, it wasn't clear if the company could give MSFT stock holders another step forward.That question was well answered today.Microsoft's Productivity and Business Processes unit - the division that's responsible for integrating LinkedIn with the company's office-productive products - drove a 22% year-over-year increase in revenue, reaching $7.96 billion. LinkedIn contributed $975 million of that figure.Intelligent Cloud revenue of $6.76 billion was up 11%, led by the 93% increase in Azure's business.The only division to lose ground was the More Personal Computing unit, which saw revenue contract 7% to $8.84 billion. That figure must be taken with a grain of salt, though. In that the Windows 10 upgrade was free for consumers using other versions of Windows and computer companies were and still working through their necessary hardware tweaks for the operating system, a year-over-year comparison doesn't mean much.Moreover, Microsoft's abdication of the smarphone market chopped $730 million off this division's top line for the quarter.Regardless, the More Personal Computing arm may be on the verge of heating up again. Earlier this month Microsoft announced it was putting the finishing touches on itsCloudBook that will compete with Google's small-form-factor Chromebooks. This is a sliver of the PC marketGoogle's Chromebooks have been doing well in… perhaps a little too well for Microsoft's comfort. The CloudBook will not only be price-competitive, but desirable in that they will utilize the familiar Windows 10 operating system.That opens the door to further (and easier) integration with other Microsoft platforms and apps.Looking Ahead for MSFT StockPrior to Thursday's report, analysts had projected a profit of 68 cents per share on $24.52 billion in revenue for the quarter currently underway. That bottom line is a penny less than the prior year's fiscal Q3 earnings, though the top line outlook is 8.3% better year-over-year.Nadella Has Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock Purring Like a KittenFor the full year, those same analysts are modeling earnings of $2.98 per share of MSFT stock on sales of $96.61 billion, both of which are stronger than last year's comparable figures.The company will deliver guidance during the Q3 earnings conference call, scheduled for 5:30 p.m. EST Thursday.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 Dividend Stocks That Will Deliver Double-Digit Returns Every YearThe 10 Best Stocks for the Next 1,361 Days of President Donald TrumpAlphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Will Survive Earnings.

Close Update: Nasdaq Sets Record High as Tech Sector Dominates;4/27/2017;"The major market averages closed higher as a record high in the Nasdaq helped the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 climb back into positive territory.

And once again, Alexa is inside.What Is Echo Look?Amazon has built a wireless camera with a built-in microphone array, a speaker and Alexa integration. Like the Amazon Echo, you can ask Alexa to play music, order toilet paper or control you smart home devices using Skills. Oh, it's also a camera.Amazon is positioning it as something that works with your smartphone as a kind of virtual mirror. The command ""Alexa, take a picture"" snaps a full length photo with background blurred. Amazon says this makes your ""outfit pop"" and blurring the background makes your photos more shareable (presumably by hiding all your dirty laundry and unmade bed).5 Tech Stocks to Buy for Growth AND DividendsYou can get a live look at yourself from different angles using the Echo Look app. You can ask Alexa to shoot a video so you can see yourself from every angle. And you can submit photos of yourself to Amazon for AI advice based on input from ""fashion specialists."" You can also create a personal ""lookbook"" in the app, which appears to be a catalog (remember those?) of you modelling all your outfits.Why Would Anyone Want This?People who want to be dressed according to the whims of artificial intelligence? People who haven't figured out mirrors? If you live alone, or don't trust the fashion sense of the people you do live with, Echo Look promises a second opinion on your outfit choices. Albeit, an option from an AI owned by a company that wants to sell you new clothes.With the ongoing addition of Skills that integrate it with other services and devices, it's possible that the the Echo Look could also expand into functionality like a fitness camera (capturing progress photos) or a security camera.So What Could Go Wrong?It goes without saying that Echo Look is going to be used in ways that AMZN had not intended. That's human nature. Put a camera in bedroom that snaps photos or shoots video on voice command, with LED lighting and lenses that blur the background, and it seems inevitable that content shot with Amazon Echo is going to start showing up online.Of course the elephant in the room is the ongoing privacy concerns about smart speakers. People have been freaked out about Alexa always listening. What if Alexa is also always watching? Amazon toldArsTechnica UKthereisa button tophysically disable the camera and microphone.It's a single button, however, so if you turn off the camera, you also shut down Alexa voice command. So people are going to be tempting to simply leave it on so they can continue to ask Alexa the weather forecast.Unless you do get in the habit of physically shutting it down after each use, the potential is there for things to go sideways, Already this year, we've seen Amazon Echo speakers fooled by a TV broadcast withAlexa ordering dollhouses for viewersin the San Diego area. Then there was the commercial that infamously ""hacked"" Google Home tostart reciting hamburger info from Wikipedia.With Echo Look, you have the same basic vulnerabilities at play, but this time there's not just a microphone and a direct connection to your amazon.com account; there's also an internet-connected, voice-controlled camera pointed at you.How to Get an Amazon Echo LookDespite the potential risks involved, there are going to be people who want to buy an Amazon Echo. So how do you get your hands on one? If you have your $199.99 you have torequest an invitation from Amazon.Intel Corporation (INTC) Stock Is a No-Brainer Buy Ahead of EarningsIf selected, AMZN says you'll receive a notification e-mail. Everyone else will have to wait until Amazon decides whether or not to launch the Echo Look to the public before they can say ""Alexa, take a picture.""As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace3 ETF Options to Hedge Against the Next Market CrashThe 7 Top-Paying Dividend Stocks You Need To KnowForget Bank of America Corp (BAC) Stock: Buy These Stocks InsteadThe postAmazon.com, Inc.

Is Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) More Beneficial to Customers Than Investors?;4/27/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsI have to tell you, I want to like retail juggernautAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) as an investment. I really do. I am a committed fan of Amazon as a consumer and happily pay up for its Prime service every year. Like most customers, I find the $99 annual fee a small price to pay for free two-day shipping for the year, access to Prime entertainment (though I rely more heavily onNetflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX) and other perks I am sure I do not use like I should.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockThe success of AMZN stock has been so resounding that it is frequently mentioned as THE reason that bricks-and-mortar retailing is in crisis mode.Arecent retail surveyin the Atlantic details that nine retail bankruptcies have already occurred in 2017, and a multitude of store closures across the current operators. Meanwhile, Amazon's retail sales have grown firm $16 billion to $80 billion since 2010.It's difficult to think of a traditional retailer who is thriving these days. I gave up on investing inRalph Lauren Corp(NYSE:RL) andUrban Outfitters, Inc.(NASDAQ:URBN) some time ago.Sears Holdings Corp(NASDAQ:SHLD) is thought to be close to bankruptcy,Macy's Inc(NYSE:M) is closing stores andStaples, Inc.(NASDAQ:SPLS) may eventually sell office supplies online and through its mail-order services that its business customers prefer.Why Amazon Stock Is KingAMZN stock is benefiting from the convergence of the internet, communicating via mobile devices and cloud computing. Amazon customers shop the internet via mobile phones, and do so while at competing stores. I just did it while at aBarnes & Noble, Inc.(NYSE:BKS) store - a book I purchased was nearly 40% cheaper on Amazon, and I got it shipped to my house the next day.7 Blue-Chip Stocks Every Investor Should OwnAmazon also happens to be one of the biggest operators in the cloud. Its Amazon Web Services reported $3.5 billion in sales during the most recent quarter and operating income that is approaching $1 billion quarterly. That was a high percentage (71%) of total company operating income of $1.3 billion.As you might have guessed, AMZN stock is growing rapidly, and it is expected to continue to do so.  Sales growth is projected just above 20% in each of the next two years and should hit $200 billion by the end of next year. Profits are expected to jump from $7.24 per share to $12.44 per share over this same period.Given the current share price of $918 per share, that is still a pretty rich earnings multiple (187 and 73, respectively).Alphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), parent of Google, is growing nearly as fast, and trades below 30 times earnings projections.This is where the wheels come off for me in terms of investment appeal. I just can't get comfortable with where the current valuation is for AMZN stock. At a 30 times multiple, the share price should be closer to a ballpark between $21 and $36 per share. In my mind, a $100 share price seems a stretch given the current reported earnings levels - even considering hyper growth for the foreseeable future. Nine times that level just seems silly.The cash flow picture calms my nerves only slightly. I was excited to read Amazon's financial slides covering its fourth-quarter 2016 financial results. Page 3 states the following: Long-term goal - optimize free cash flows. The same slide details full year free cash flow (operating cash flow less capital expenditure) jumped 32% year-over-year to $9.6 billion, or close to $20 per share.A 30x multiple off of that cash flow figure (which is also growing briskly) gets me to $600 per share.  However, free cash flow less principal repayments of both capital and finance lease obligations was only $5.7 billion, or less than $12 per share. Now, I'm back to $360 per share - max.These capital lease obligations essentially account for the massive warehouse space Amazon is having to secure to support its growing empire. It is reasonable to include them as an annual cost of doing business, and therefore subtract them from free cash flow. It will likely slow in the future -Wal-Mart Stores Inc's(NYSE:WMT) lease obligations are under $1 billion per year.Don't Be Fooled. Twitter Inc (TWTR) Earnings Sucked.This brings us to one of the key arguments for investing in Amazon stock - it is ambitiously investing for its future. This future should have ample free cash flows for investors that care about an eventual return on their capital. But, at what price?Bottom Line on AMZN StockMy conclusion is that there is too much uncertainty to get comfortable investing in Amazon stock at the current share price. Revenue growth is easily as good as you'll find with such a large company, and the profits are starting to really come in. But much of the profitability is from AWS, which is another fantastic growth avenue, but also fiercely competitive.This means, as it stands currently, Amazon doesn't make much money from its core retail operations.  It also has to spend heavily to expand warehouse space. It's also building out its own fleet of jets to ship goods. Plus, it wants to spend heavily to develop its own entertainment content. Its ambitions are enviable, but also potentially reckless.And the trading multiples for AMZN stock (both based on earnings and free cash flow) are just too high based off of current profit trends. At this price, I would be inclined to gamble on the recovery of a traditional retailer that trades closer to 10 times earnings. Or invest in Alphabet, which is a comparative steal at closer to 30 times earnings (and cash flow). It may turn out that Amazon benefits its customers most, which I am just fine with.As of this writing, Ryan Fuhrmann was long shares of Alphabet.More From InvestorPlaceThe 10 Best Cheap Stocks to Buy for $10 or LessThe 7 Top-Paying Dividend Stocks You Need To Know10 Stocks That Won't Exist in a DecadeThe postIs Amazon.com, Inc.

Interesting GOOGL Put And Call Options For July 21st;4/27/2017;"Investors in Alphabet Inc (Symbol: GOOGL) saw new options become available this week, for the July 21st expiration. One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 85 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. AtStock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the GOOGL options chain for the new July 21st contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $885.00 strike price has a current bid of $25.90. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $885.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $859.10 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of GOOGL, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $890.44/share today.Because the $885.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 55%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under thecontract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 2.93% return on the cash commitment, or 12.57% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this theYieldBoost.makeArticleAd();Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Alphabet Inc, and highlighting in green where the $885.00 strike is located relative to that history:Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $895.00 strike price has a current bid of $28.50. If an investor was to purchase shares of GOOGL stock at the current price level of $890.44/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $895.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 3.71% if the stock gets called away at the July 21st expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if GOOGL shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Alphabet Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing GOOGL's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $895.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $895.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 50%. On our website under thecontract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.20% boost of extra return to the investor, or 13.74% annualized, which we refer to as theYieldBoost.The implied volatility in the put contract example, as well as the call contract example, are both approximately 18%. Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $890.44) to be 15%.

Intel Corporation (INTC) Stock Is a No-Brainer Buy Ahead of Earnings;4/27/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) is set to report first-quarter fiscal 2017 earnings results after the closing bell Thursday. And INTC stock, which has declined 2.5% in three months, is poised for a breakout north of $45 per share in the quarters ahead.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockA Look Inside IntelIntel CEO Brian Krzanich - in his fifth year at the helm - seems intent onputting Intel's cash to use. The company's $15.3 billion acquisition of Israeli self-driving technology companyMobileye NV(NYSE:MBLY) was themost recent example. This deal follows a $16.7 billion acquisition forAlteraback in 2015.All told, Intel is now in the driver's seat with autonomous vehicles, thanks to Mobileye, which will allow it to better compete withTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) and Google parentAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL).What's more, the company is no longer on the outside looking when it comes to smartphones. Aside from winning chip placement inApple Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone 7 and possibly future iPhones, Intel continues its push in the realm of Internet of Things and in the data center market.7 Blue-Chip Stocks Every Investor Should OwnKrzanich, who has found ways to get Intel's top line growing again, has shown to have a good pulse on what the company needs. He's done a solid job managing both Intel's growth and the company's costs. From my vantage point, these factors make INTC stock, which pays a 3% yield, a no-brainer buy (to steal a phrase from billionaire investor Carl Icahn). And the company's earnings results Thursday, combined with solid guidance could be the catalyst to send INTC stock higher.For the quarter that ended March, the Santa Clara, Calif.-based company is expected to earn 65 cents per share on revenue of $14.81 billion. This compares to the year-ago quarter when the company earned 54 cents per share on $13.8 billion in revenue. For the full year, ending in December, EPS is expected to rise 3% year over year to $2.80 per share, while full-year revenue of $59.93 billion would rise 0.8% year over year.Beyond the revenue and EPS numbers, analysts will also focus on the extent to which the Data Center Group (DCG) segment, which contains server/networking, can offset the any pressure Intel might face this quarter in Client Computing Group, which contains its PC and mobile processor business.Bottom Line for INTC StockAhead of Thursday's result, INTC stock has risen just 2% year to date, trailing the 6% rise in theS&P 500index, suggesting there's plenty of pessimism that the company, which has beaten analysts estimates on both the top and bottom lines in two straight quarters, will do so again. But with INTC stock priced at just 13 times fiscal 2017 estimates of the $2.80 per share, compared to a an 18 P/E for the S&P 500 index, these share should reach $45 in the next 12 to 18 months, delivering 22% returns.As of this writing, Richard Saintvilus did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace7 Blue-Chip Stocks Every Investor Should OwnThe 10 Best Stocks to Buy for the Next DecadeApple Inc.

Nadella Has Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock Purring Like a Kitten;4/27/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsJust a little more than a year ago,Microsoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) was anything but a sure thing. It seemed ill-equipped to compete withAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in the cloud. It wasn't clear that therelatively new CEO Satya Nadellawas going to make the company's Office suite a worthy revenue center again. And the software giant was rolling the dice on a Windows 10 operating system that, if a flop, could spell doom for MSFT stock.makeArticleAd();Source:Johannes Marliem Via FlickrWhat a difference a year makes.Not only was Windows 10 well received, Microsoft is just crushing it in the cloud on the back of its Azure product.Still, while Nadella seems to be getting all the company's ducks in a row, Microsoft stock holders have yet to see a particularly decisive quarter that suggests the company is back to its former greatness.Will Thursday's fiscal Q3 report do the job?Microsoft Earnings PreviewAs of the latest look, analysts collectively expect the software giant to turn $23.4 billion worth of revenue into a profit of 69 cents per share for the recently completed quarter. MSFT earned 62 cents per share of on $22.1 billion in sales in the same quarter a year earlier.The outlook, if met, would mark the best revenue growth Microsoft has mustered in two years.The past couple of years haven't been easy ones. Sales continued to grow in 2015, but income took a big hit as then-relatively new CEO Nadella wasn't able to get the organization entirely ready for the rapid rise of cloud computing. Income rebounded but sales fell in 2016, leaving investors unsure as to the sort of growth the company was capable of producing.The 10 Best Cheap Stocks to Buy for $10 or LessSlowly but surely, though, Microsoft has unveiled new initiatives that make its existing services more marketable. The final quarter of last year (June) saw respectable growth, but not convincing growth. Thursday's post-close report of third-quarter results has the potential to prove the company is on the right track.What to WatchThough the top and bottom lines will be the most looked-at measure of the company's third quarter report, there's a select group of details that will ultimately push MSFT stock higher or lower. Three matters stand out above the rest. In no certain order, keep an eye (and ear) on…LinkedIn Impact:The acquisition of LinkedIn wasn't completed until December 8, so Microsoft hasn't yet reported a full quarter with its sales and earnings contribution factored in. That will change on Thursday.We do have a pretty good idea of what to expect, though. Before the buyout was consummated, LinkedIn was doing nearly a billion dollars worth of business a quarter, and had just turned profitable. Microsoft may have stepped in right at the company's inflection point.That being said, MSFT stock owners have only begun to see what the company intends to do with the professional networking site. Only in the past few days has Microsoft explained it wants tointegrate LinkedIn's data with its Dynamics 365 platform. That still only scratches the surface of how LinkedIn could be leveraged, though.CloudBook:While Windows 10 may still be the king of all laptop operating systems, Microsoft doesn't really have much of a presence in the low-end and small form-factor netbook space. That's whereAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL) is really starting to gain traction with its Chromebook lines.That may be about to change, however.Microsoft is prepping a launch of a so-called CloudBook, which will not only be price- and performance-competitive with Chromebooks, but will offer a very familiar and very flexible Windows operating system.Cloud/Azure:For the unfamiliar, Azure is an efficient way for users tointerface with a variety of cloud services. It matters just because Microsoft wouldn't be making any revenue headway in the cloud without it.Last quarter's server and cloud services revenue was up 12% on a year-over-year basis, thanks to Azure's 93% top-line improvement. The company has been adding to Azure's menu in the meantime.Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Is All Grown Up. That's a Problem.Bottom Line for MSFT StockWhile its fiscal third quarter is an important one, don't let a lack of a big earnings beat paint an unnecessarily pessimistic picture of what's to come. Although it's taking a while, Nadella really does seem to have all the parts of the engine synced up quite nicely.As our Chris Lau said on Monday:""Microsoft continues to produce strong revenue growth and profits. Its cloud-computing platform is expanding, and the costs to build it are falling. As more companies migrate apps to cloud services, Microsoft's sales will keep going up. Meanwhile, MSFT stock still has the support of Microsoft's legacy businesses and strong cash return to shareholders via dividends and buybacks.""It's tough to disagree with that assessment. The only concern a newcomer might feel is stepping into MSFT stock after the 35% run-up its dished out following its year-ago earnings report. Meanwhile, shares continue to touching new highs in 2017.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace7 Blue-Chip Stocks Every Investor Should Own10 Dividend Stocks That Will Deliver Double-Digit Returns Every YearThe 10 Best Stocks to Buy for the Next DecadeThe postNadella Has Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock Purring Like a Kittenappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Ford Motor Company (F) Stock Growth Story Recalled for Repair;4/27/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe growth story atFord Motor Company(NYSE:F) suffered a setback during the first quarter as the costs of recalls bit into profits.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockThe company said it had income of $1.6 billion,40 cents per share, on revenue of $39.1 billion, compared with net income of $2.4 billion, 61 cents per share, and revenue of $37.7 billion a year ago.Despite this, the shares rose nearly 2% in premarket trading because the company hadwarned about the number last month, predicting profits would come in at 30 cents to 35 cents per share.The biggest contributor to the shortfall was the cost of repairing cars under warranty,which rose $467 million.The company also spent $253 million more on product launches than a year ago, and $176 million more on commodities.The company issued an optimistic set of estimates for the full year, saying costs should not increase for the rest of the 2017 and the company should earn $9 billion.Ford Car Sales PeakedU.S. car sales peaked in December at 18.7 million units, coming in at just 16.9 million for the month of March.5 Stocks to Sell in MayThe peak came in well short of peaks achieved in previous recoveries, but until March had been within a range of 17 million-18.7 million for two years. The average car on U.S. roads is now11.6 years old, a full year older than it was in 2010, as U.S. automakers have worked to match the quality of foreign cars.Unlike rivalGeneral Motors Company(NYSE:GM), Ford isnot making up for U.S. weakness with strength in China. The company's sales there last month came in at 90,457 units, down 21% from a year earlier, and were down 19% year over year.Changing Chinese tax laws on new auto purchases were blamed. A tax of 10% dropped to 5%, and then rose this year back to 7.5%. Sales of cars not subject to the tax, those with larger engines, were up 21% against a year ago.Our Tom Taulli was recently down on Ford, saying the stock is cheap but""cheap is not enough.""He wrote that Ford has become a niche player, and its niche is light trucks like the F-150. Its vaunted entry into new markets like electric cars and self-driving cars are thus hampered by lack of scale.F Stock a Bargain?Auto stocks have been cheaper than the market throughout this decade. Despite not having taken a bailout in 2009, Ford has languished with the rest, losing one-third of its value since a 2014 peak of nearly $18 per share. It will open for trading on Apr 27 at under $12.This has left it with a price-to-earnings multiple of barely 10, and a dividend rate of 5.2% that has become the best reason to own the stock. The company usually covers this dividend with earnings, and the most recent quarter is no exception. An extraordinary 2016 led to a 20-cent-per-share dividend paid in January, but the rate fell back this month to its regular 15-cent-per-share level.Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) to Battle Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) for Class CrownF stock's balance sheet shows the total debt-to-assets ratio being kept level at about 60%, but half of that consists of current liabilities endemic to the auto business, things like short-term debt and accounts payable. Long-term debt comes in at a little over $90 billion on nearly $240 billion in assets.The bottom line remains what it was before the report. Ford is a great stock to buy for income, but a lousy stock to buy for capital gains. Since it re-launched its dividend in 2012, it has tripled the payout, while the shares have gone nowhere, and it would be wrong to expect that to change.Dana Blankenhornis a financial and technology journalist.

Starbucks Corporation (SBUX) Should Dip After Earnings, And That’s OK;4/27/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsUntil its latest rally,Starbucks Corporation(NASDAQ:SBUX) was flat for about a year. However, a 7% push since April 13 has given SBUX stock a breath of fresh air, and put it on the path to overtaking its 2015 highs.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockStarbucks is currently one of the few fast-casual diners (which it's typically grouped into) that are doing well in the U.S. Same-store sales are sub-5%, but at least they're growing.And the progress that the company is making in China is unbelievable. China eventually will be a larger market than the U.S. for the coffee titan, so the progress it makes there over the next decade is critical.Arising dividendis another argument for the bulls.The question heading into Thursday afternoon's fiscal second-quarter earnings report, though, is what path will SBUX stock take from here? Will it rocket to all-time highs, head back from whence it came, or something in between?Expectations for StarbucksSBUX stock hit a new 52-week high on Wednesday, bringing expectations higher as well. Often, when a stock rallies like this into earnings, it turns into a ""sell the news"" event.10 Dividend Stocks That Will Deliver Double-Digit Returns Every YearI think Starbucks earnings could be setting up for a similar reaction. Perhaps it's not an outright sell. But the reaction to earnings could result in a small pullback for SBUX stock or a muted reaction after-hours.There's one thing that makes gauging Starbucks a little trickier, though: U.S. same-store sales.For the past two quarters, Starbucks has turned in a subpar report card, with 4% U.S. comps. For almost any other company, those are great numbers. But for SBUX, it broke a long string of quarterly comps north of 5%.Then-CEO Howard Schultz - who stepped down and is now executive chairman - was unhappy with the results. Traffic had turned stores into a frenzy near peak hours, according to management, and Starbucks is trying to implement solutions to get people through more efficiently.Thus, American comps could be underwhelming again this quarter. But (and this is a big but) if management tells us they've found a solution and second-half same-store sales will accelerate, investors likely will use that as their buy/sell trigger over other results.How to Trade SBUX StockThis latest breakout is quite refreshing. For long-term investors who are truly thinking long-term, stay the course. There's no reason to veer away from a terrific company.For short-term investors, though, Starbucks is trickier to navigate.We believe the stock has gone too far, too fast. As a result, a muted reaction higher or pullback is the most likely outcome.SBUX stock is overbought in the short-term, as seen by its Relative Strength Index reading on the chart (top purple circle). This doesn't mean a correction is due, but it does increase the odds that Starbucks is exhausting itself.Clearing through the $58 to $59.50 region of resistance was a big move. Barring a terrible quarter, this region should act as support. Given that the stock's 10-day moving average is at $59.50, I would expect it to act as support too.Under Armour Inc (UAA) Stock Races Higher on a Critical Q1 BeatA pullback of 2% to 4% would be really healthy on the back of a strong quarter. It will allow the stock to digest some of its gains and rebuild momentum for a push higher.Those who are already long can stay for the ride, or consider selling some upside calls. This gives Starbucks stock a bit more room to rally, but adds some income in the event of a pullback.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author ofFuture Blue Chips.

Multimedia Weekly Digest: Tech Talk And Arconic CEO Ouster;4/27/2017;"BySA Multimedia:Welcome to the seventh instalment of SA Multimedia's Digest, where we combine videos and podcasts from across Seeking Alpha's contributor base into a single weekly article.With Alphabet (GOOGL) (GOOG) set to announce earnings after market close today, we thought we'd begin with an earnings preview fromTusk Media.The main story for Google continues to be the paid per click and cost per click figures. Paid per click is the amount of times that someone clicks on an advertisement. Cost per click is the amount of money Google revenues from an advertisement view. The recent trend in earnings releases has been a decline in cost per click and an uptick in paid per click. In Ben's personal research, the increase in paid per click has more than compensated for the declining cost per click trend.makeArticleAd();Speaking of big tech names,Samadhi Partnerscovered Facebook's annual F8 Developer Conference on their latest Perspectives on the Tech podcast.

Will Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock Hit $950? It’s Not a Given.;4/27/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe flood of corporate earnings reports reaches a fever pitch Thursday, and online retailing giantAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) will be among those releasing their reports after the close of trading this afternoon. While Amazon has a history of strong performances in the earnings confessional, the fate of AMZN stock is not a foregone conclusion. Especially with revenue growth for Amazon Web Services (AWS)cooling off last quarter.makeArticleAd();So today, we're going to look at how Amazon trading is shaping up ahead of its Q1 report this afternoon, and suggest a couple of trade ideas to position yourself for profits.Diving into the numbers, Wall Street is expecting a profit of $1.13 per share, up 5.6% year-over-year, on revenue of $35.31 billion - up 21.2% from year ago levels. But AWS will be a considerable focus this time around.The division saw revenue growth slowto a gain of 47% to $3.5 billion last quarter, down from 55% in the third quarter and 58% in the second quarter of 2016. Currently, analysts are expecting AWS revenue to come in at $3.6 billion.Taking a closer look at expectations, sentiment is running rather bullish on AMZN stock ahead of earnings.EarningsWhispers.com places the whisper number at $1.20 per share, a full 9 cents ahead of the consensus. Furthermore, Thomson/First Call reports that 40 of the 44 analysts following Amazon rate the shares a ""buy"" or better. However, there is some dissent in the ranks, as Raymond James recently downgraded the stock to ""Market Perform"" from ""Outperform.""5 Stocks to Sell in MayOn the other hand, options traders are heavily toward the bearish on AMZN stock ahead of the report. For instance, AMZN's April/May put/call open interest ratio arrives at 1.22, with puts outnumbering calls among near-term options. Furthermore, this ratio rises to 1.25 when we zero in on just the April 28 series (i.e., those options most affected by Amazon's quarterly report).Click to EnlargeDespite the potential for AWS to affect the post-earnings move in Amazon stock, April 28 implieds are pricing in a potential post-earnings move of only about 4% for the shares - a figure below historical volatility for the shares ahead of such events.In short, Amazon options are relatively inexpensive at the moment.Currently, the upper bound of a post-earnings move rests near $947, while the lower bound lies near $873.2 Trades for AMZN StockPut Sell:With unknowns surrounding AWS revenue, and Amazon bouncing around $900 for the past month, the safest play ahead of earnings may be an out-of-the-money put sell position. Currently, the28 April $850 put selllooks like a solid way to capitalize on Amazon's technical support.At last check, this put was bid at 97 cents, or $97 per contract. The upside to this put sell strategy is that you keep the premium as long as AMZN stock closes above $850 when 28 April options expire at the end of this week. The downside is that should Amazon shares trade below $850 before expiration, you could be assigned 100 shares for each put sold at a cost of $850 per share.Under Armour Inc (UAA) Stock Races Higher on a Critical Q1 BeatCall Spread:On the other hand, if you have the risk tolerance to buck the bearish trend in the options pits, consider aMay $920/$950 bull call spread.At last check, this spread was offered at $10.11, or $1,011 per pair of contracts. Breakeven lies at $930.11, while a maximum profit of $19.89 is possible if AMZN stock closes at or above $950 when May options expire.As of this writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceForget Bank of America Corp (BAC) Stock: Buy These Stocks InsteadLook to Short Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock After Q1 Earnings3 Stocks to Watch on Thursday: Nokia Oyj (ADR) (NOK), Amgen, Inc.

Thursday’s Vital Data: United States Steel Corporation (X), Twitter Inc (TWTR) and Netflix, Inc. (NFLX);4/27/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsU.S. stock futures are treading water this morning ahead of another deluge of corporate earnings reports, led by the likes ofFord Motor Company(NYSE:F) andDow Chemical Co(NYSE:DOW). Additionally, Wall Street is digesting details from President Donald Trump's tax plan, which were unveiled last night. Analysts say the plan is light on details and does not provide information on funding for the tax cuts.makeArticleAd();Heading into the open, futures on theDow Jones Industrial Averageare up 0.05%, withS&P 500futures down 0.02% andNasdaq-100futures ticking 0.03% higher.On the options front, volume remained well above average on Wednesday, with about 16.1 million calls and 13.1 million puts changing hands. On the CBOE, the single-session equity put/call volume ratio stagnated at 0.61, as did the 10-day moving average, which held at 0.70.Driving Wednesday's most active options, shares ofUnited States Steel Corporation(NYSE:X) plummeted nearly 27% yesterday as the company offered up an abysmal first-quarter report. Meanwhile,Twitter Inc(NYSE:TWTR) finally showed signs of growth, sending options traders scrambling for calls. Finally,Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) is consolidating after breaking out to fresh all-time highs following a licensing deal with China'sBaidu Inc (ADR)(NASDAQ:BIDU).United States Steel Corporation (X)On Wednesday, shares in U.S. Steel Corp. suffered their biggest single-day loss since the company went public roughly 26 years ago.5 Stocks to Sell in MayInvestors were none too pleased with the company's reportedfirst-quarter lossof 83 cents per share, as analysts were predicting a profit of 35 cents per share. Revenue came in at $2.73 billion, also falling short of Wall Street's predictions for sales of $2.95 billion. Furthermore, U.S. Steel halved its full-year 2017 earnings outlook.X options traders were also shocked. Volume on the day came in at a near-term high of 717,000 contracts, with calls actually eking out 54% of the day's take. Following yesterday's plunge, X stock is now trading well below all major call strikes in the May series, with the nearest meaningful accumulation totaling about 2,200 contracts at the $23 strike. Meanwhile, heavy put accumulations still lie below X stock in the May series, with 3,100 at the $22 strike and 2,500 at the further out of the money $18 strike.Twitter Inc (TWTR)After several quarters of drought, Twitter finally offered up a solid quarterly report yesterday, and options traders are cashing in. For the quarter, Twitter said it earned 11 cents per share on revenue of $548 million, blowing past the Street's estimates for a penny per share on sales of $511.9 million.User growth was also better than expected, with Twitter adding 9 million - 7 million more than expected - on the quarter to hit 328 million users. However, the report wastempered by second-quarter guidanceof $95 million to $115 million, which fell well shy of estimates for $141 million.TWTR options traders flooded the stock with calls following the report. Total volume swelled to more than 554,000 contracts, with calls snapping up 75% of the day's take. Many of these calls may have been the work of profit taking, and if you got into theMay $15/$16 bull call spreadI suggested on April 20, be sure to set stop losses or be ready to close out if TWTR trades north of $16 - if you didn't get out at the peak early yesterday.Netflix, Inc. (NFLX)NFLX shares surged to fresh all-time highs on Tuesday following news that the company hadbroken through into the Chinese market. Netflix signed a licensing deal withiQIYI, a streaming platform owned by China-based Baidu. iQIYI currently supports about 500 million monthly subscribers, providing Netflix with a considerable viewer base in country. Terms of the content provided are not yet clear, but Netflix's original content is rumored to be in the mix, which is another huge win for the company.Under Armour Inc (UAA) Stock Races Higher on a Critical Q1 BeatBut NFLX options traders expressed caution during Wednesday's trading, with calls only making up 56% of the more than 277,000 contracts traded on the stock.Furthermore, the $150 strike could be a major point of contention for NFLX going forward, as there are more than 7,000 call contracts currently open at this strike in the May series, with about 2,200 puts thrown into the mix as well.As of this writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceThe 10 Best Cheap Stocks to Buy for $10 or Less7 Blue-Chip Stocks Every Investor Should OwnLook to Short Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock After Q1 EarningsThe postThursday's Vital Data: United States Steel Corporation (X), Twitter Inc (TWTR) and Netflix, Inc.

3 Stocks to Watch on Thursday: Nokia Oyj (ADR) (NOK), Amgen, Inc. (AMGN) and PayPal Holdings Inc (PYPL);4/27/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsU.S. equities took an unexpected hit on Wednesday despite the unveiling of a tax plan from President Donald Trump that would seem to benefit corporations and individuals alike. TheS&P 500dipped 0.1%, theDow Jones Industrial Averagefell 0.1% and theNasdaq Compositelost a fraction of a percentage.makeArticleAd();This morning, a couple of stocks are pushing higher on their most Thursday earnings announcements, includingNokia Oyj (ADR)(NYSE:NOK) andPayPal Holdings Inc(NASDAQ:PYPL).Amgen, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMGN), however, is having a rough go of things in early morning trade.Here's what you need to know heading into Thursday's action.Nokia Oyj (ADR) (NOK)NOK shares jumped amid a clear sign of an improving business and a revenue beat for its latest quarter.The company earned 3 cents per share for the quarter, matching estimates. That came on a 3.8% decrease in revenues that topped estimates of $5.33 billion - and while the figure was lower year-over-year, it was a much slower decline than the year-ago period's 14% dip.Said CEO Rajeev Suri: ""We slowed the rate of topline decline and generated healthy orders in what is typically a seasonally weak quarter for us.""5 Stocks to Sell in MayThe acquisition ofAlcatel-Lucentdid ding the company's pre-tax loss, which expanded in Q1.Nokia reiterated its full-year outlook of 1.2 billion euros in cost savings, as well as 250 million euros in non-IFRS financial income and expenses.NOK stock was shooting 7% higher ahead of Thursday's bell.Amgen, Inc. (AMGN)AMGN stock is on its way down after the company's first-quarter earnings report, which included big disappointments from some of its key drugs.The biotechnology firm did score an earnings beat, bringing in $3.15 per share versus expectations for $3.01 per share.However, sales slipped by 1% to $5.5 billion, coming short of the mark for $5.6 billion. That was thanks in large part to a steep decline in sales of its arthritis drug, Enbrel, off 15% year-over-year and shy of analyst estimates.The company also underwhelmed with its newest treatment, the cholesterol drug Repatha. Repatha garnered just $49 million in sales for Q1, against analyst estimates of $71.6 million.The company did keep its revenue guidance intact, however, reaffirming its outlook of $22.3 billion to $23.1 billion. Moreover, it raised earnings guidance to a range of $12-$12.60 per share, up from $11.80-$12.60.But the revenue miss was enough to spook investors, who sold AMGN stock off by about 3% in Thursday's early trade.PayPal Holdings Inc (PYPL)PYPL shares were moving steadily higher on Thursday after the company reported afirst-quarter earnings beat.Look to Short Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock After Q1 EarningsThe payment services provider earned 44 cents per share on an adjusted basis, compared to the 41 cents per share that the Wall Street outlook called for.

Revenue was also strong at at $2.975 billion, coming in 17% higher year-over-year topping projections for $2.94 billion.There were other positives, too, such as a 50-basis-point improvement in operating margins, and 6 million new accounts added over the quarter, bringing its total to 203 million.""With another quarter of strong financial results, we continue to deliver on our vision to democratize financial services for our consumers and drive the global transition from cash to digital payments,"" said Dan Schulman, president and CEO of PayPal, in a statement.The company also announced a $5 billion share repurchase program.PYPL shares were up 4% in Thursday's premarket action.More From InvestorPlace10 Dividend Stocks That Will Deliver Double-Digit Returns Every YearApple Inc.

Look to Short Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock After Q1 Earnings;4/27/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsToday marks a big day for U.S. large-cap technology stocks, and Google parentAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL) will be among the companies at center stage. Year-to-date, GOOGL stock is about 12% higher, and it marginally pushed to fresh all-time intraday highs Wednesday just ahead of Thursday's Q1 earnings report.makeArticleAd();Some traders say momentum is on Alphabet's side. Others say the upside momo is exhausted. I see a better trading opportunity likely arising on Friday, April 28, once the initial reaction to the earnings news has run its course.But before we look at the possible trade setups in GOOGL, let me be clear that I'm a long-term believer in Alphabet as a continuing growth story and innovator in technology. As such, any trade ideas for the near- to intermediate-term, whether long or short, should be considered separate from a longer-term bullish view.When I last discussed Alphabet stock onMarch 8, I pointed to a bullish setup in which the stock was coiling up for a pop. I gave a near-term upside target in the $870-$880 range. Seven trading days later, the stock traded as high as $874, tagging the middle of my upside target range, where at least partial profit taking was in order.And,as I discussed yesterday, what GOOGL does - along withAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN),Microsoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) and other big tech names reporting tonight - should have a lot of pull on the Nasdaq-100 and other large stock indices.5 Stocks to Sell in MayNow, we look at the charts, and look ahead.GOOGL Stock ChartsOn the multiyear chart, we see that Alphabet still is ascending at an impressive rate and thus in a steep (and steepening) slope. The rally over the past two weeks has once again brought the stock back to the very upper end of its ascending wedge-like formation (purple dotted lines).Click to EnlargeFrom where I sit, it's difficult to imagine much more sustainable upside from here. At least not before GOOGL stock settles into a new consolidation period.On the daily chart, we see that the 7% rally over the past two weeks has pushed GOOGL shares not only to the upper end of the bigger-picture uptrend, but also to the upper end of the multiquarter trend.Click to EnlargeThe options market is currently pricing in about a $27-$30 move following Thursday's earnings report. Based upon Wednesday's closing price around the $890 mark, we could see shares trading as high as $920 or as low as $860 after earnings. (Assuming the options market has this priced correctly.)Under Armour Inc (UAA) Stock Races Higher on a Critical Q1 BeatThe $900 area may offer a psychological area of technical resistance. That is, a sustainable move above $900 - even if the stock blasted through this level in an immediate-term post-earnings reaction - might prove unlikely.My focus after earnings will be to ""fade"" or ""short any up-gap in GOOGL stock, particularly should it trade into the $910-$920 area.Alternatively, if the stock were to trade lower after earnings, it may provide an opportunity to sell out-of-the-money spreads and see the stock fall back toward the mid- to lower $800s.Like what you see?

Amazon (AMZN) Earnings: What To Expect;4/27/2017;"Amazon earnings (Shutterstock photo)Retail giant Amazon (AMZN) is set to report first quarter fiscal 2017 earnings results after the closing bell Thursday.The company’s e-commerce dominance, which continues to claimbrick-and-mortar victimssuch as hhgregg, has become an afterthought. It’s a given that Amazon, which in Q4 beat on EPS by a whopping 19 cents, will either meet or exceed its core e-commerce revenue projections. The company’s Prime members will continue rise,  quarterly revenue will grow above 20% and it can’t keep its record-breaking Echo speaker on the shelves. These measures have been taken for granted.makeArticleAd();In the three months that ended March, the Seattle-based company is expected to earn $1.13 per share on revenue of $35.31 billion. This compares to the year-ago quarter when the company earned $1.07 per share on $29.13 billion in revenue. For the full year, ending December, EPS is expected to rise 47.7% year over year to $7.24 per share, while full year revenue of $165.26 billion would rise 21.5% year over year.Clearly, Amazon is still expected to put up impressive growth numbers. Notably, this is even despite its massive size of over $434 billion in market cap, which is almost twice the size of Wal-Mart (WMT). What analysts will focus on during the quarter, however, is the performance of the company’s cloud platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS).While AWS remains the clear-cut leader in the industry, it is not alone anymore. Unlike other gimme areas of the business, AWS is being pressured by competing platforms from Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL). The increased pressure has forced Amazon to cut its prices to stay ahead. And this is a big deal given that AWS is the company’s most-profitable business segment.To be sure, Amazon is not struggling with AWS. Despite a Q4 revenue miss, AWS revenue in the fourth quarter surged 47% year over year to $3.54 billion. It’s worth watching, nonetheless, because the 47% rise marked a deceleration from 55% growth in the third quarter and 58% growth in the second quarter. Wall Street is forecasting for AWS revenue of $3.6 billion, which would mark a growth of 40%. Will that be enough?Analysts will also focus on the company’s profit margins. Amazon continues to invest in ways to strengthen its logistics, while also expanding internationally. Plus, when combined with its grocery stores bets and Prime Video content spending, investors are likely going to take a collective deep breath and hope that CEO Jeff Bezos — as he’s known to do — pulls another rabbit out of his hat.Amazon stock closed during Wednesday’s regular session at $909.29, up 0.18%. The stock has risen 21% year to date, besting the 6% rise in the S&P 500 Index. I continue to expect Amazon stock to reach $1,100 per share, delivering 21% returns in the next 12 to 18 months."

In addition to   choosing a company with the best technology, it's important for   investors to consider which company stands to reward shareholders   the most from the coming boom in driverless cars.Let's take a look at where the three tech giants mentioned   above stand to determine which one is the best driverless-car   stock for investors looking to get the most bang for their   buck.A game of partnershipsThese major tech companies have been in a partnership-forming   frenzy to create alliances with leading car manufacturers to   accomplish the automotive equivalent of landing a rover on Mars.   Alphabet has been working on self-driving cars for several years   and has racked up 2 million self-driven miles, but it's not   planning to build its own car. Its renamed Waymo division (which   stands for ""a new way forward in mobility"") is working on   partnerships with carmakers. For its part, Intel plans to acquireMobileye, an Israel-based technology company purely focused on developing   computer vision, data analysis, mapping, and other computer   systems for driverless cars.But investors considering Intel or Alphabet as a driverless   car investment should be mindful of one very important thing. Any   future growth from driverless cars will only provide a marginal   benefit to Intel's and Alphabet's top lines. Intel's 2016 revenue   was $59.4 billion and Alphabet's was $90.3 billion. Let's compare   that with the market opportunity.PwC Strategy& estimates the revenue opportunity for those   providing the technology that helps cars drive themselves will   cross $50 billion by 2022. Intel has estimated that the market   for vehicle systems, data, and services will be $70 billion by   2030.If Intel captured 100% of the $70 billion estimated to be the   market opportunity in driverless cars, then its revenue would   increase 118% over the next 13 years, or about 6% per year. Throw   in a few more percentage points of annual growth from its   existing business, and investors are looking at a company that   might get 10% per year in annual revenue growth, which might be   enough for Intel stock to keep pace with the S&P 500 index,   but nothing more.Alphabet generated $90 billion in revenue in 2016, so its   potential upside from driverless cars also offers   shareholders marginal benefits. And with so many companies   jockeying for position in the driverless car market, it is   unrealistic that one company is going to control 100% share of   the market.If you're looking for a stock with plenty of return potential   from driverless cars, you want to find a company that has a small   amount of revenue compared to the estimated size of the   opportunity. That way there is plenty of room for the company's   revenue to expand exponentially by winning market share in the   driverless car market and provide shareholders the potential to   beat the S&P 500 index over the long term. That leads me to   NVIDIA.CompanyMarket CapAnnual Revenue in Recent YearIntel$173$59.4Alphabet$600$90.3NVIDIA$61$6.9Data source: SEC 10-K filings. All dollar figures in   billions.The best self-driving car stockA better option is NVIDIA, which is just aswell-positionedin the driverless car market as Intel and Alphabet and has the   room to see its top line soar. NVIDIA generated $6.9 billion in   revenue in 2016 and it has the necessary expertise in developing   a crucial piece of technology powering the brains of driverless   cars -- the graphics processing unit (GPU). The GPU developer has   been forming animpressive listof partnerships with several major automakers, includingVolkswagen AG's Audi,Daimler AG's Mercedes-Benz,Honda Motor Co,BMW, andTeslaamong many others.NVIDIA is even partnering withBaiduto develop automated parking, HD mapping, and advanced automated   vehicle control.NVIDIA has also signed agreements to supply itsDRIVE PX 2 car computerto truckmakerPACCAR, as well as major auto suppliers such as ZF and Germany-based   Bosch.NVIDIA's revenue from its automotive segment totaled $487   million in fiscal 2017, which ended in late January. The graphics   specialist is not a pure-play on self-driving cars, as the   company is also selling graphics processors to video game   enthusiasts and cloud computing providers, among other uses of   its graphics technology. But given its relatively small amount of   $6.9 billion in total revenue, the company will benefit   shareholders much more from any future growth of self-driving   cars compared to larger peers like Intel and Alphabet.Find out why Nvidiais one of the 10 best stocks to buy nowMotley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent     more than a decade beating the market.

Amazon Q1 Earnings Preview: How Much Will AWS Grow?;4/26/2017;"In what promises to be one of the busiest days of season, several of the world's biggest tech companies, including the likes of AlphabetGOOGLand MicrosoftMSFT, are set to post their latest reports on Thursday. Nevertheless, investors can expect internet behemoth AmazonAMZNto hog the attention when it releases its first-quarter resultsafter the market closes.Over the past several years, Amazon has transformed from an e-commerce innovator into a bonafide powerhouse in every corner of the tech world. The company now boasts a portfolio that includes a burgeoning media department, millions of premium members, and the fast-growing Amazon Web Services (AWS) unit.Amazon Web Services is a collection of enterprise-level platforms designed for websites and companies that can't afford the time or money it takes to develop their own server farms. In short, AWS provides cloud-based storage and templates for companies to quickly boost their computing capabilities.The cloud computing industry is thriving, and AWS is booming. What's more, the segment offers Amazon some reliable profitability, allowing the company some leeway to burn cash on other projects. All one needs to understand about AWS can be found when looking at its growth rates and margins.Amazon Web Services revenues came in at $3.536 billion for the fourth quarter, marking year-over-year growth of 47%. These results brought the segment's full-year total to $12.219 billion, up more than 55% from its prior-year total of $7.880 billion.And at the same time that Amazon has been able to grow the AWS division, it has also been able to make it more profitable.Keeping the unit's 2015 and 2016 revenue totals in mind, note that its operating income in 2016 was up to $3.108 billion from $1.507 billion in 2015. This means that the Web Services unit operated with an EBITDA margin of 25.4% in 2016, which was a nice improvement from the EBITDA margin of 19.1% it posted in 2015.So this is why everyone will be looking at AWS when Amazon reports tomorrow, but how will it perform? Well, let's take a look at what our consensus estimates are saying.This important stock driver is from our exclusive non-financial metrics consensus estimate file. These estimates are updated daily and are based on the independent research of expert stock analysts.Learn more here>>>Our latest consensus estimate calls for AWS revenues to hit $3.7 billion this quarter-an increase of 42% from the year-ago quarter. This would also represent a roughly 5.7% increase from last quarter's totals.While this growth rate is certainly still impressive, it's interesting to note that AWS growth looks to be slowing down a bit. Last quarter, AWS revenues grew by 55%, and in Q3 the segment posted growth of about 59%.Sure, AWS is quite a long way from its plateau, but it could be on the horizon eventually. Nevertheless, investors should look to see if Amazon can continue making the business more profitable.Make sure to check back here for our analysis once Amazon reports on Thursday!Want more stock market analysis from this author?

Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) to Battle Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) for Class Crown;4/26/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsNext week,Microsoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) will host a spring hardware event in New York City to showcase its latest and greatest new devices, as well as unveil the Windows 10 Cloud edition of the company's iconic operating system.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockThe interesting part, though, is not anticipation of a new device or expectancy of some revolutionary program rollout.Rather, the focus is expected to heavily surround the Windows 10 Cloud OS and management'sintentions to shift significant attention to the education market.CEO Satya Nadella will, apparently, be allocating a larger portion of the company's resources to wage war against tech behemothAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) in the classroom arena. BothMicrosoft and Google each sport their own classroom servicesthat offer teachers and students alike the opportunity to learn, work and collaborate using a variety of tools designed to increase efficiency and cultivate a productive environment.However, despite having equally robust and functional Classroom products, MSFT has struggled to gain ground against GOOGL since the official release of Microsoft Classroom in April 2016. Comparatively, Google Classroom has been around since August 2014 and, for the most part, it has been very well-received across the country by professors and teachers as well as students ranging from elementary school-age up through universities and grad schools.Why Google Has an Advantage in ClassroomsMany investors have wondered why MSFT would be willing to spend such time, money and resources to get its software in front of elementary school-age children. Well, last year, shortly after the debut of Microsoft Classroom,Fortune's Barb Darrow answered that question,explaining:Tech titans know that if they want to expand their customer bases, they've got to get 'em while they're young. That's why Google and Microsoft have targeted teachers and younger students with special editions of their bread-and-butter software packages.The idea is if you learn to type on Microsoft Word or Google Docs, you'll keep typing and working on one of those options for life. That's the rationale behind the companies' respective Google Classroom and Microsoft Classroom franchises.5 Tech Stocks to Buy for Growth AND DividendsWith this in mind, the battle for dominance in classrooms across the country makes a lot more sense.Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL), which has been battling Microsoft in classrooms across America since the release of its Apple IIe desktop computer in the 1980's, was in a solid position to maintain top market share with the iPad release in 2010. Almost immediately, the iPad became a nationwide hit with teachers and students alike, and by 2013, Apple devices accounted for nearly half of all shipments to classrooms, while MSFT devices only accounted for 29%.And so the war waged on, as it had for more than three decades prior, with AAPL and Microsoft vying for the attention of America's pupils in hopes of establishing a lifelong brand loyalty by putting their devices in classrooms across the country. Meanwhile, all along GOOGL had been laying the groundwork for making further inroads into educational institutions by marketing Google Apps for Education, which integrated with Google Drive and Gmail.GOOGL rather quickly disrupted what had traditionally been a solid duopoly - like it had done (and continues to do) with a number of other services - and rose to become the top dog, rocketing past the competition thanks to a few key elements that, together, were much more desirable for both students and educators.While Apple and Microsoft focused on marketing their hardware, Google had realized that students and teachers were still using its cloud platform to create, share and collaborate, regardless of the device they used to access its cloud services, hence the introduction of Google Classroom.With development of the functional, yet extremely inexpensive, Chromebook device, which provided for extremely easy access to the web-based applications that the bulk of students and teachers already used, it was no surprise when GOOGL amassed a 58% market share in early 2016.Source: FutureSourceSo,asFast Companyput it, ""Caught on their heels in the U.S., and anxious that Google's Chromebooks will soon repeat their success overseas, Apple and Microsoft are fighting to regain momentum. First, they need to convince educators that in a world of rapidly changing technology they can give both students and teachers a competitive edge.""Microsoft Has a Plan to Compete Against GoogleWhile it's no secret that many consumers, investors and analysts alike frequently tend to view MSFT as ""old school"" and GOOGL as the better, more modern technology company. However, not everybody feels this way, and there's no denying that Microsoft has the experience and resources to remain a major player in the tech industry. The question, though, involves finding the most potentially profitable areas for future development and growth of MSFT stock.According toWindows Central,""the timing is right for Windows 10 Cloud.""Apparently, management has learned from the Windows RT debacle and has a new strategy in place to properly and successfully market Windows 10 Cloud as a viable alternative to Google and its line of Chromebooks.If the company can gain traction and start chipping away at Google's market share, that could translate into solid long-term support for MSFT stock. Unfortunately, it will be many months before anything concrete is available, and even those figures will just be preliminary. It could take at least a year before any meaningful earnings and revenue figures are released, which is what will ultimately be the driving force behind a change for Microsoft stock.The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for the Next DecadeOf course, don't expect Google to merely sit on its laurels, either. The company is no stranger to competition, and openly encouraged innovation is a unique part of the company culture. It's less likely, though, that GOOGL stock will experience effects as powerful as MSFT stock, simply because Google's structure does not need successful PC/tablet sales to remain profitable.Keep an eye on the Microsoft Spring Hardware event next week, because if management can make an impressive display of Windows 10 Cloud, there's a good chance that teachers and students will also be receptive.As of this writing, Greg Gambone did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace7 Blue-Chip Stocks Every Investor Should Own3 Downtrodden Stocks That You Need to Short Now10 Dividend Stocks That Will Deliver Double-Digit Returns Every YearThe postMicrosoft Corporation (MSFT) to Battle Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) for Class Crownappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Can Alphabet Sustain Its Momentum?;4/26/2017;"Shares of Google parentAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) are up 23% over the past year,   including a nearly 13% climb in 2017 (as of this writing) to sit   near all-time highs. The internet-search behemoth can thank itsexceptional fourth-quarter 2016 results, announced in late January, for that climb, driven by the   success of its mobile search and YouTube platforms, as well as   momentum in its early-stage ""other bets"" businesses.But at least in the near term, this week's report will show   whether Alphabet was able to sustain its momentum as it kicked   off the new year. So let's take a closer look at what investors   should be watching when Alphabet reports tomorrow,after the market closes.IMAGE SOURCE: ALPHABET.makeArticleAd();Alphabet's headline numbersFirst, keep in mind that Alphabet doesn't provide specific   quarterly revenue or earnings guidance. So for perspective --   while we don't typically pay close attention to Wall Street's   demands -- consensus estimates predict first-quarter revenue will   climb 19.4% year over year, to roughly $24.19 billion, and   translate to earnings of $7.40 per share.More broadly speaking, management did tell investors last   quarter that Alphabet plans to focus its efforts this year both   on continuing the momentum of Google's core advertising business   (which we'll discuss more below), and simultaneously investing in   newer diversified revenue streams including Google Play, hardware   like Chromecast and the Pixel smartphone, and Google's cloud   computing and hosting platforms.""G"" is for GoogleIn keeping with Alphabet's reorganization and shift towardsegment-based reportingjust over a year ago, expect to see a breakdown of the company's   two primary operating segments: Google and ""Other Bets.""The former is the financial core of Alphabet's business,   encompassing Search, Android, Maps, Chrome, Google Play, Gmail,   and YouTube, as well as Commerce, Apps, Cloud, and hardware.   Together, these services represented nearly 99% of Alphabet's   total $26 billion in revenue and all operating income last   quarter. Within that, advertising revenue comprised almost 86% of   total revenue last quarter. But don't be surprised if   advertising's influence falls as contributions from   non-advertising businesses increase.Alphabet will also break those results down to help investors   better understand its ad revenue, including the growth and   percentage that came from its own properties versus network   member sites. We'll also see the latest growth in aggregate paid   clicks (up 36% year over year last quarter), as well as aggregate   cost per click, the latter of which measures how much Google   makes per ad. Note, however, that aggregate cost per click has   steadily declined in recent quarters -- the metric fell 15% in Q4   -- thanks to enviable growth at YouTube, where the TrueView ad   format monetizes at lower rates as a byproduct of reaching   consumers earlier in the purchase funnel.What to watch in Other BetsMeanwhile, the Other Bets segment is made up of promising   pre-revenue businesses operating in a wide variety of industries,   including Google Fiber (high-speed internet), Calico (human   longevity), Verily (life-sciences products), Google Capital   (capital investments), Nest (connected home), and X (""moonshot""   initiatives).But while Other Bets' top line is growing nicely through sales   of Nest, Fiber, and Verily products, this segment will almost   certainly continue to generate large operating losses. Last   quarter, for example, Other Bets revenue climbed nearly 75% year   over year, to $262 million, and generated an operating loss of   $1.088 billion -- albeit narrowed from an operating loss of   $1.213 billion in the same year-ago period.Of course, those losses are more than recouped through   Alphabet's immensely profitable Google operations. And Alphabet   management will likely reiterate that investors would do best to   view Other Bets through a long-term lens, noting that their   eventual success could hold the key to unlocking several   multibillion-dollar industries.In any case, tomorrow's report will give us a peek at   Alphabet's progress toward that end. So be sure to check back to   see how it fares.10 stocks we like better than Alphabet (A     shares)When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Why Chipotle (CMG) Stock is Still Awful for Growth Investors;4/26/2017;"Following the earnings report for Chipotle (CMG) last night, investors seemed to be putting the troubled company back in their good graces. After all, CMG did manage to beat expectations on both the top and bottom lines, crushing EPS estimates by 25%.We saw articles lauding the company'sstrong same store sales growth, as well as Jim Cramer noting that the company is 'back and it's bigger than ever', stating that the 'business will only get strong as the year goes on',according to thestreet.com. And while Chipotle definitely posted some nice same store sales numbers compared to a year ago-including growth of 17.8%-- is this really a fair comparison, or an accurate measure of CMG's return to glory?Let's not forget that a year ago the company was deep in a food safety scare and saw revenues of just $834 million, the lowest level since the first quarter of 2013. And while EPS was up significantly year-over-year as well-going from a loss in Q1 2016 to a $1.60/share profit this quarter-investors should also consider where the company was before the food scandal took place too.From those numbers, Chipotle basically hasn't done anything at all. Take a look at revenue and EPS from Q1 in 2015, before the words 'food safety' and 'Chipotle' were tied together. In that quarter, CMG earned $3.88/share and saw revenues of $1,089 million. So, how are today's growth rates looking now with this context?Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. Price and ConsensusChipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. Price and   Consensus|Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. QuotePretty terrible if you ask me.Chipotle hasn't grown revenues at all since Q1 2015, and its EPS is still well below its 2015 level too. In fact, Chipotle was earning almost 46% more per share in Q1 2013 than it is today!So, Why Is It a Growth Stock?For whatever reason, people are still putting Chipotle into the category of 'incredible growth stock' that is usually occupied by tech companies. Yes, Chipotle disrupted the fast-casual market years ago, but it has gone nowhere since that initial burst. As one analyst,Standpoint Research's Ronnie Moas, said, ""Chipotle is being treated like it's an ""Amazon, Tesla, Apple, or Google, when in fact all they do is make burritos.""Right now, shares have a forward PE of 57.8. That is close to four times as high as Apple (AAPL), nearly double Facebook (FB) or Alphabet (GOOGL). And remember, this is for a company that hasn't grown EPS in ages.This trend is kind of an outlier in the restaurant world too, so you can't even make the excuse that it is a sector wide problem. The industry does have a sluggish rank right now, but behemoth McDonald's has grown earnings per share by over 33% since the first quarter of 2015, while rivals Jack in the Box (JACK) which owns Qdoba (a similar burrito chain but with tasty breakfast burritos as well), and healthier option Panera (PNRA) have seen solid growth rates too. If anything, Domino's (DPZ) could offer a good comparison, thanks to its rich PE and focus on innovation, but (as you can see in the chart below) the company has been a great investment and has grown earnings time and time again.Domino's Pizza Inc 12 Month EPSDomino's Pizza Inc 12 Month EPS|Domino's Pizza Inc QuoteAnd yes, we currently have an 'A' Grade for Growth on CMG, but I think it falls into that one-year look trap as well. Take a two year look for these metrics and it doesn't become nearly as favorable. Plus, with an overall grade of 'C', and not to mention a value score of 'F', this doesn't exactly have a compelling profile from a fundamental look, especially with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), and recent estimate cuts from analysts as well.Bottom LineDon't get too excited about the recent report from Chipotle, the company still has a very long way to go when it comes to justifying its absurd PE multiple. The stock is being treated like are a high tech player, when in reality they are in the cutthroat world of fast casual dining instead. Plus, while their assembly line concept was revolutionary, new ideas since then have been few and far between, leaving them to come up with items like'bunuelos' or fried tortilla strips with sweet toppings, as their 'innovation' now.To me, getting back to where you were two years ago is no reason to believe that CMG is a top growth story again, or that the company is back and bigger than ever. This is especially true with recent worries about apossible data breach as well, as now data safety is something is called into question for the company too.And it isn't like a massive surge in earnings is projected in the near future either. Current estimates for the coming quarters include $2.53/share for the summer and $2.46/share for the fall. These figures are still below where they were two years ago, so investors looking for growth might have to wait a little longer.So, the bottom line to me is that if you want a restaurant stock, get one that is growing earnings and revenues, and isn't plagued by safety issues from multiple angles. And if you want a high tech, high growth company, the tech sector-or at least a company like Domino's (DPZ) which is heavily reliant on tech at this point-is probably the better place to go right now. These days, Chipotle isn't doing either one very well.Eric also writes a weekly fund newsletter.

Go Long Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock at a Discount;4/26/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) continues to slaughter its perma-bears. It's almost always tempting to short the beast, but that concept is lost on me. I fail to see why I need to short the strongest, longest-running growth mega-cap that has ever existed.makeArticleAd();Source:Mike Seyfang via FlickrFundamentally I give kudos to AMZN for its slim margins as long as it maintains its rate of growth and its domination through Amazon Web Services. AWS, as it's known, is the leader of what we know as ""the cloud.""Well, you got me. Yes, I recently shared a trade toshort AMZN which paid quicklyeven if someone didn't book the debit puts perfectly. The difference is that I wasn't betting against the company's prospects nor was I shorting it because of its valuation. I was merely trying to profit from the short-term price action.When Amazon stock fell on its last earnings report, I went on record saying that it would hit $900 per share in weeks.Today I want to write about going long AMZN into the earnings event knowing that there could be a hitch in the giddy up. Competition is gaining on AWS from the likes ofAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) andMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) to name a couple. Furthermore, during its last earnings report, I saw reasons for concern on growth and AWS.The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for the Next DecadeSo far Wall Street has ignored them, but I need AMZN stock to not repeat so that those mini flubs don't gain steam and cause a sell-off.AMZN Stock Trade IdeaThe Bet:Buy AMZN June $915/$920 debit call spread for $2.40 per contract. This is a bullish trade that has a chance to double if Amazon stock rallies past it by mid-June. I chose June to give myself a little time in case they have a temporary dip on earnings.To lower my out-of-pocket expense and mitigate my immediate risk, I will leverage proven support levels to generate income.The Bank:Sell AMZN July $750 put and collect $3 to open. This bullish trade has a 90% theoretical chance of success. If AMZN stock falls below my strike, I own it and accrue losses below $747 per share. I could make this a credit put spread to appeal to a wider range of risk tastes.Taking both trades means that I could be long AMZN through earnings for a net credit so as long as AMZN stays above $750, and any premium I recover from selling the debit call spread is pure profit.Learn options as easy as 1-2-3 in a personal 1on1 webinarhere.

You’ll Like Buying Facebook Inc (FB) Stock at $138 for a Profit!;4/26/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAs they say, the trend is your friend, but so are channel checks. As that relates to tech giantFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) and its stock chart, an alternative reality where investors are less likely to like shares is entering the picture. Let me explain.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockIt has been a nice run since FB stock forged a corrective move late last year on nowobviously misplaced fearsof what a Donald Trump administration would mean for the tech giant and its Silicon Valley compadres. Sorry, Jeff Gundlach andDoubleLine Asset Management.But rather than think the coast is clear with shares up some 25% in four months while hitting fresh all-time-highs, maybe it's time for a channel check of sorts in FB stock? This strategist likes to think so.Bottom line, with Facebook sporting a massive market cap of $426 billion, solid but well-priced fundamentals and earnings in a week, it makes more than a bit of sense both off and on the price chart to make sure we know just how much we really like FB stock.FB Stock Weekly ChartReviewing the Facebook stock weekly chart and it leaves little doubt the trend is up. Even during 2016's late corrective activity, shares lost but 15% while maintaining the integrity of its uptrend of the past three years. Net, net, it goes without saying Facebook is one well-liked stock.7 Blue-Chip Stocks Every Investor Should OwnHaving said that, Facebook does pull back once in a while and the current situation looks close to being one of those more rare occasions. They're far from perfect, but the detailed ""channel checks"" and ""channel supports"" trend lines and FB's Bollinger Bands, have done a reasonable job warning traders of imminent reversals in price.Will this time prove different, with Facebook traders more resilient against the temptation of profit-taking or another corrective move? It's possible, of course. Nevertheless, while trends can persist longer than thought possible, the current channel check does, more or less, emphasize that FB stock is a better pullback candidate than purchase.FB Stock Modified Put Butterfly SpreadSo, where would you like to buy FB stock? If you're like me and appreciate the price chart, it's at a discount to the current share price of $146.50, but still within the existing trend. One way in which Facebook options traders can do this today is with a modified long put butterfly.Reviewing the FB puts, the Weeklys 12 May $140/$138/$135 put butterfly is priced for even money to maybe a debit of 5 cents.Regular long butterflies cost money due to the matching widths of the embedded verticals. But with a modified version like this one where the sold $138/$135 put spread is slightly wider, it's possible to execute for free or even a credit.Assuming a no-cost spread purchase, if shares of Facebook fall by less than 4.4% or below $140, at expiration the spread goes out worthless. This amounts to a no harm, no foul situation as the position didn't cost anything to enter. Of course, if shares of FB are down by let's say 3%, the trader can always decide if he or she wishes to purchase the stock.Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Couldn't Sink Itself if It TriedShould shares of Facebook manage to drop by 5.8% to $138 into expiration the trader will be in position to realize a profit of $2. This is the result of the owned $140/$138 bear put spread expanding to its maximum value, while the sold (and wider) bull put spread expires worthless.If shares of Facebook get really ""unliked"" by investors, the break-even on this butterfly is $136 or 7.1% below today's price. Below $136 and losses begin to accrue. The good news is a loss of $1 per spread with shares below $135 is as bad as it gets. Of course, if you still like the FB stock story, buying on weakness like that, or even uglier price action, just got a whole lot friendlier to consider.Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in any of the securities or their derivatives mentioned in this article.

Why General Motors Company (GM) Stock Keeps Beating the Odds;4/26/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsGeneral Motors Company(NYSE:GM) stock dropped sharply recently even though the company's performance last month in China - the world's largest auto market - was very impressive. Meanwhile, General Motors' North America business is holding its own and beating the company's  guidance. As a result, the recent decline in GM stock, which has a very low valuation, has created an extremely attractive buying opportunity for investors.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockGeneral Motors stock has fallen nearly $2 per share, or about 5.5%, since General Motors reported March U.S. sales that came in below expectations.The company's U.S. salesrose just 1.6% compared with the same month in 2016. But the report certainly wasn't dismal, as General Motors' total sales volume did rise, while its retail sales, which carry higher margins than fleet and government sales, climbed 5%, and sales of high margin GMC SUV's and crossovers surged 12%. Additionally, sales of the company's expensive Buick cars jumped 22% year-over-year.GM Stock and the China ReboundBut more importantly, General Motors' sales in China last month were stupendous and bode very well for the longer-term outlook of GM stock.Specifically, the company's sales volume surged 16%YOY to 345,448, which represented a record for the month of March. Furthermore, General Motors achieved its largest 12-month sales increase in China since August 2016. Additionally, the surge indicates that, after the company suffered two months of weak salesfollowing a sales tax increase in January 2017,Chinese consumers are ready and able to buy GM vehicles in droves again.Furthermore, sales of General Motors' SUVs in China jumped 48%, while sales of its multi-purpose vehicles i.e., minivans surged 63%, and sales of its luxury Cadillac vehicles skyrocketed 63%. The tremendous popularity of its most expensive vehicles in China should significantly boost the company's profit margins in that country and put upward pressure on its overall margins going forward.7 Best Chinese Stocks to Buy on Renewed GrowthGM: Beating Guidance, Analysts' OutlookThe strong rebound in China also looks poised to raise the equity income that General Motors receives from its joint ventures in the country, thereby enabling it to exceed its 2017 guidance and the consensus 2017 earnings-per-share estimate.In February,GM had predictedthat its sale mix in China would improve this year, i.e., it forecast that it would sell more SUVs, minivans and luxury vehicles in the country in 2017 than in 2016, causing its margins to increase this year.However, General Motors also predicted that its overall sales volume growth in the country would fall below last year's 7% increase . If the trend seen in March continues, that estimate will obviously prove to be quite conservative.And General Motors was not very upbeat about the outlook for its North America business in February, predicting that sales in the region would drop year-over-year and that its margins in North America would be flat in 2017 versus 2016. So, after GM's U.S. sales rose 1% in the first quarter, with favorable mix changes last month, the company looks set to exceed its guidance in North America.Bottom Line on GM StockWith General Motors' two largest markets beating the company's outlook recently, its 2017 EPS guidance of $6 to $6.50 is looking pretty conservative. And analysts' consensus estimate of $6.01 is looking conservative.Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Couldn't Sink Itself if It TriedSimilarly, GM stock looks quite undervalued at current levels. It's trading at about 5.5 times the conservative forward-price-to-earnings estimate. Conversely,Ford Motor Company(NYSE:F) is trading at a forward P/E of 6.9. Moreover, GM's price-to-sales ratio is 0.3, versus 0.4 forHonda Motor Co Ltd (ADR)(NYSE:HMC) and 0.6 forToyota Motor Corp (ADR)(NYSE:TM).With surging sales in China, a North American business that's beating low expectations and an undervalued stock that declined recently, General Motors is definitely a great investment right now.As of this writing, Larry Ramer did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceThe 10 Best Cheap Stocks to Buy for $10 or LessThe 10 Best Stocks to Buy for the Next Decade7 Blue-Chip Stocks Every Investor Should OwnThe postWhy General Motors Company (GM) Stock Keeps Beating the Oddsappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Couldn’t Sink Itself if It Tried;4/26/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsPresident Dwight Eisenhower once remarked, ""Accomplishment will prove to be ajourney, not a destination."" President Donald Trump, before he took office, stated emphatically, ""I could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue andshoot somebodyand I wouldn't lose voters."" Such timeless words have never been more appropriate forAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL).makeArticleAd();Source:Travis Wise via FlickrAlphabet has proven, perhaps more than any other company in the world, that accomplishment is indeed a journey. A cursory look at GOOGL stock will settle the deal for most folks. Beyond that,InvestorPlacecontributor Dana Blankenhorn hit the nail on the head when he discussed Alphabet Inc's success. They kept it simple, and ""focused on whatcomputers do.""On the flip side,Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ:YHOO) did not take that advice to heart. Frankly, the results speak for themselves. Although YHOO's lifetime returns are 3,400%, when you compare it to its internet-bubble peak, shares are down 55%. Comparatively, GOOGL stock is up over 1,500% lifetime - and it keeps going and going and going.Yahoo's success was a destination; Alphabet Inc is on a journey.Unfortunately for any would-be rivals, that journey may never end. Even if Alphabet committed the equivalent of shooting someone on 5th Avenue, people would still buy GOOGL stock.7 Blue-Chip Stocks Every Investor Should OwnAs Blankenhorn beautifully states, ""You don't talk to GOOGL before buying their search service, you just type (or talk). You don't talk to Alphabet before buying their advertising, you just buy it online. Clouds scale to infinity and beyond, and with its niche secure, the company is a money-making machine you can't turn off.""It's All About the Search EngineOf course, no company is without criticism. For mighty Alphabet, analysts have questioned its leverage towards its search engine and advertisement business.InvestorPlace'sChris Lau argues thatexcessive advertisementscould water down its users' search engine experience. In theory,Microsoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT), via its search engine Bing, would benefit, putting direct pressure on GOOGL stock.Alphabet Inc is well aware of the concerns, and are actively addressing them. The company's ever-popular Gmail service now offers the ability to send money to other users. Again, in theory, this action competes against firms likePayPal Holdings Inc(NASDAQ:PYPL).GOOGL also throws its weight around in the smart devices sector. If it weren't for internal controls, Alphabet would be a madhouse, a chaotic mixture of both the practical and speculative.But to Blankenhorn's original point, if the internet giant engages in extracurricular activities, then it risks becoming another Yahoo. While the endeavors may justify a product engineer's job, the reality is simple. The only thing that can upend GOOGL stock is if Alphabet management abandons its core market.Even then, that's a stretch. To paraphrase former California Governor Schwarzenegger, GOOGL ""cannotself-terminate.""GOOGL Stock Is BulletproofIn prior articles, I mentioned Alphabet's incredible advantage over its search engine rivals. I wish to further reiterate this point with astounding new data.Click to EnlargeTo quickly recap, the gap between first and second place is insurmountable. Therefore, the real competition is for second place. But the data shows just how insurmountable a lead Alphabet (and likely, GOOGL stock) really has. From the beginning of this decade to January of this year, Google's search engine market share averaged 89.7%. The spread between its highest market share and lowest is a miniscule 3.9%. Additionally, its seven-year trailing market share ""profitability"" is only -1.9%.Let these numbers sink in for a second.Consider the around-the-clock competition that GOOGL attracted since the start of the decade. Don't just think myopically, either. Global brands likeBaidu Inc (ADR)(NASDAQ:BIDU) are especially eager to crack a few heads. Yet with all that time, Alphabet's would-be rivals haven't done jack.United States Steel Corporation (X) Stock Gets Slammed: Who's to Blame?If they did do jack, we would notice the efforts. In the search engine space, GOOGL stock is waist-deep in a mature market. Typically, this is a ripe period for fresh blood to swoop in. But the hubris of Alphabet is that they deny any and all swooping, including from themselves.In all these years, all other search engines combined could only take a lousy 2% from GOOGL. This metric, above all else, proves how utterly impossible it is to challenge Alphabet Inc'sDeath Star. So investors can rest easy. GOOGL stock couldn't be Yahoo if it tried.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceThe 10 Best Cheap Stocks to Buy for $10 or LessThe 10 Best Stocks to Buy for the Next DecadeAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc.

Better Buy: Apple Inc. vs. Google;4/26/2017;"Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) andAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) -- the holding company formerly   known as Google -- are, in all likelihood, the two most powerful   technology companies in the world today. To avoid burying the   lede, both companies have outstanding economics and deserve a   place as core technology holdings in many investors'   portfolios.However, that isn't to say one company doesn't present a more   compelling option for investors right now. As such, this article   will analyze Alphabet andApple stocks through three important dimensions to see which company is more   deserving of investors' attention in the here and now.Financial fortitudeBoth Apple and Alphabet are two absurdly profitable companies.   With cash positions dwarfing the annual economic output of some   pretty large countries, these two companies are financial   fortresses in every sense of the word. Here's a quick breakdown   of a few of the most commonly used solvency and liquidity metrics   for both companies.makeArticleAd();CompanyCash & InvestmentsDebtCash From OperationsCurrent RatioApple$246.1 billion$87.5 billion$65.4 billion1.2Alphabet$86.3 billion$3.9 billion$36.0 billion6.3Data sources: Apple investor relations, Alphabet investor   relations, Yahoo! Finance. Cash from operations reflects most   recent 12 months.Most importantly, Alphabet and Apple carry effectively no   financial risk. Their respective net-cash positions of $82.4   billion and $158.6 billion alone are larger than most successful   companies' total market capitalizations, and this totally   overlooks the tens of billions in operating cash flow Apple and   Alphabet generate annually.Sure, Alphabet's current ratio trounces that of Apple.   However, taken in the context of Apple's broader business.   Neither company is at any risk of falling short of its financial   commitments. And given that Apple edges Alphabet out in terms of   net cash and cash-flow generation, the Mac maker deserves a win   in the first category of this analysis.Winner: AppleImage source: Apple.Durable competitive advantageAs alluded to in the introduction, both Apple and Alphabet   enjoy considerable durable competitive advantages.For Apple, the company's unique ability to combine beautifully   designed hardware with its internal software and app ecosystems   allows the consumer electronics giant to command prices far   higher than those of its peers. Last year, Apple recorded a $645   average selling price (ASP) for the iPhone, compared to $217 for   the average Android handset. This device premium has allowed   Apple to consistently capture the overwhelming majority of   smartphone industry profits in recent years; one sell-side   analyst estimated that Apple earned 92% of all smartphone market   profits in Q4 2016. This pricing power is the heart and soul of   Apple's competitive advantages, and it seems likely to endure   into the company's coming device cycle as Apple launches a   totally redesigned iPhone 8 this fall.Alphabet dominates its core internet search business in much   the same way that Apple controls the smartphone market. The   search giant typically controls two-thirds of the global   search market, a feat made all the more impressive by the fact   that the Google search engine is blocked and effectively   inaccessible in China. According to recent data, Google receives   over 30 billion search queries each month across its various   platforms. This breadth of exposure and the intent-based nature   of Google's searches enabled the Internet giant to command   31% of global online advertising spending last year, and evidence   suggests Facebook and Alphabet will continue to capture greater   percentages of online ad-spend in the future.This platform gives Alphabet a massive profit stream that the   tech giant has aggressively funneled back into a series of   futuristic business ideas it collects in its Other Bets reporting   segment. Though they garner significant media attention, Google's   only real profit center -- and the source of its massive   competitive advantages -- is its search business.Winner: TieImage source: Google.ValuationTurning to the third area of this investigation, here's a   quick overview of three of the most commonly used valuation   metrics as a starting point to frame our discussion.CompanyP/EForward P/EEV/EBITDAApple16.813.711.0Alphabet30.021.316.6Data source: Yahoo! Finance.Obviously, Apple is cheaper on an absolute basis. However, the   key to finding attractive stocks to buy lies in finding relative   mispricings between a company's current valuation and its   expected future performance.We can do this through a number of ways. One popular metric   that tries to capture this is the PEG ratio, which compares   companies' growth estimates against their valuations,   Alphabet trades at a PEG ratio of 1.3, while Apple is, in   theory, slightly more expensive with a PEG ratio of 1.7; a PEG   ratio of 1 is, in theory, correctly valued.However, with the average analyst estimating it will grow   sales 6% this year, I see Apple's elevated PEG ratio more as a   reflection that Wall Street is underestimating Apple's growth   potential in the year ahead. Furthermore, Apple's dividend   yield and the likelihood that it will increase its capital   return program in the coming quarterly report further enhances   the company's return profile. This one is tough, but I see Apple   as more attractively valued than Alphabet based on my thesis that   the market is underestimating the iPhone 8's potential   impact.Winner: Apple (by a nose)And the winner is...AppleHopefully, you sensed that both companies are indeed worthy   investments. However, Apple holds a slight edge in today's   analysis because of its cheaper relative valuation and its more   easily identifiable near-term growth catalyst in the form of the   iPhone 8. Still, you can't go wrong holding either tech giant as   a part of the core technology stocks in your portfolio for the   long term.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Nasdaq 6000: What It Reveals About Tech Stocks And Venture Capital;4/26/2017;"As Nasdaq hits 6,000, for investors of a certain age, any sign of strength in tech stocks brings back worrying memories, and prompts the question, “Are we headed for another tech wreck?” The answer to that is quite simply no. This time is different.There is, however, a bubble in the tech sector that investors should be watching closely; it just isn’t in the stock market.To some extent, the current stock market situation is, like back in 2000, the result of excessive optimism, or what Alan Greenspan famously called “irrational exuberance.” The difference is that in most cases today, that optimism is about increasing already substantial profits, whereas in the dotcom boom it was about simply achieving profitability. What we have now is an issue with valuation. What we had then was rampant speculation. They are not the same thing.makeArticleAd();Corporate profitability will inevitably catch up to the market at some point when it is based on expectation, even though those expectations may have gotten a little out of hand in the short term. Assuming no unforeseen “black swan” event or major economic crisis, natural economic growth dictates that the question now is one of how long it will take corporations to achieve the kind of results that the market is pricing in.That is why even though I am bearish in the short term I think it would be foolish to sell stock in mature but still growing tech companies like Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB), or Amazon (AMZN). Some short term hedging of a portfolio may be in order, but this is no time to panic.In 2000, the question with regard to many of the high flying stocks was not about how fast they could grow. It was about whether the corporations concerned would survive long enough to ever make a profit. Now, even those that have struggled to fulfill their potential such as Twitter (TWTR) are seen as underperforming, not because they are losing money but rather because they are not making enough. In fact, based on this morning’s spectacular beat, even that assertion could be seen as questionable.When it comes to the tech sector as a whole, however, not everything in the garden is rosy. The fact that Snapchat (SNAP), for example, is down over 25% from its post IPO high demonstrates one problem in the sector. If there is a bubble in tech right, now it is not in the stock market, but rather in venture capital. Funds are falling over themselves to invest in startups and as a result IPOs have changed in nature.The purpose of going public has always been to raise capital; historically it has been the cheapest and most efficient way for rapidly expanding businesses to finance continued growth. After nearly a decade of ultra low interest rates, however, and with a huge amount of venture capital funds looking for the next Google (GOOG:GOOGL), many early stage tech companies now find themselves with a wealth of financing options, even for massive sums of money, that are simple and inexpensive.As a result, many companies - think Uber and Airbnb - are staying private even as they achieve virtual ubiquity. The only reason for companies like that to go public now, it seems, is so that early investors can cash out. That is great for them, but not so good for the average investor seeking growth from a “young” tech company.If anything, that trend towards successful tech companies delaying IPOs results in less worry about stocks in the sector. Once the shares are on the market those companies have worked out the kinks, grown to a formidable size and, in many cases reached the point of being profitable. That may make some IPOs questionable from a growth perspective, but it does result in greater long term stability.Nasdaq 6K is not, then, a cause for worry. There is no unsustainable bubble in the stock market. Venture capital, on the other hand, is showing the kind of irrational exuberance for the tech sector that got us into trouble before. That doesn’t pose a danger to most retail investors, but those in that market will one day have to pay the price."

5 Must-Watch ETFs as Nasdaq Hits 6,000;4/26/2017;"Thanks to the surging technology sector and broad market rally, the tech heavy Nasdaq Composite Index topped the major milestone of 6,000 for the first time in Tuesday's trading session. This represents the first 1000-point move since the dot-com era in early March 2000. Notably, the index gained nearly 12% in the year-to-date timeframe, nearly double the returns of the Dow Jones and S&P 500.makeArticleAd();Tech SurgeMost of the surge came from five technology giants - AmazonAMZN, AppleAAPL, MicrosoftMSFT, AlphabetGOOGLand FacebookFB- that collectively account for 40% weight in the index. These stocks are scaling new highs this year and are the major beneficiaries of Trump's proposed policies, especially the tax reform, which could allow companies to bring back cash being held overseas at lower rates. As promised, the President is expected to announce a big tax reform and tax reduction today (read:5 Hottest Tech ETFs of 2017).Additionally, the emergence of new technology such as cloud computing, big data, Internet of Things, wearables, VR headsets, drones and virtual reality devices are fueling growth in the sector. With the global economy picking up momentum, technology companies are likely to outperform and are less susceptible to interest rates or deregulation.Moreover, the tech sector is expected to be the second largest contributor to record Q1 earnings growth in many years, trailing finance. It will likely post earnings growth of 11.2%, per the latestEarnings Preview.Broad Market RallyPart of the upside also came from the broader market rally on continued political relief from the outcome of the first round of the French presidential election, which has eased fears of a populist rise. Further, solid earnings have been driving the market higher. In particular, big companies outside the technology sector such as fast food chain McDonaldMCDand construction machinery maker CaterpillarCAThelped the Nasdaq to outperform yesterday (read:5 European ETFs Soaring on French Election Results).Given this, investors seeking to ride the Nasdaq bull could consider the following ETFs.

Texas Instruments (TXN) Beats on Earnings and Revenues in Q1;4/26/2017;"Texas InstrumentsTXNor TI's first-quarter 2017 earnings and revenues came ahead of expectations.Earnings of 89 cents per share (excluding 8 cents discrete tax benefit) surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 6 cents. Revenues of $3.4 billion beat the consensus mark by nearly a billion.Shares were up 1.59% at the end of Tuesday's trading in response to the better-than expected results. Year to date, the stock has outperformed the ZacksSemiconductor - Generalindustry. It gained 12.4% compared with the industry's gain of 3.6%.The strong results were driven by strengthening auto and industrial markets. The communications market grew slightly year over year. The personal electronics market was stronger compared to the year-ago quarter. Enterprise systems declined.Internally, the company has always executed rather well. It, along with chipmaker IntelINTC, remains one of the few semiconductor companies that depend on internal capacity for manufacturing the bulk of its devices. Since the company usually builds out capacity well ahead of demand, it is able to make opportunistic purchases. As a result, it is able to contain capex at up to 4% of sales even while on an expansion plan.Texas Instruments continues to prudently invest its R&D dollars into several high-margin, high-growth areas of the analog and embedded processing markets. This is gradually increasing its exposure to the industrial and automotive markets and increasing dollar content at customers, while reducing exposure to volatile consumer/computing markets.At the call, management stated that the company will remain focused on increasing free cash flow per share and strengthening competitive advantages. Overall, we remain optimistic about TI's compelling product line, the differentiation in its business and lower-cost 300mm Analog output. We note that channel inventories remain very low, meaning that demand is likely to remain strong.Let's see what the numbers say.RevenueRevenues of $3.41 billion were slightly down sequentially but up 13.1% year over year (within the guidance range of $3.17 billion and $3.43 billion) and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3%.The automotive market continued to be strong. The company also saw broad-based improvement in the industrial market.Growth of analog and embedded processing applications business was strong. The Other segment declined.

The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights: Johnson & Johnson, Schlumberger, Honeywell, Alphabet and SunTrust Banks;4/26/2017;"makeZacksArticleAd();For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL - April 26, 2017 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog includeJohnson & Johnson(NYSE:JNJ-Free Report),Schlumberger(NYSE:SLB-Free Report),Honeywell(NYSE:HON-Free Report),Alphabet(NASDAQ:GOOGL-Free Report) andSunTrust Banks(NYSE:STI-Free Report).Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations.Get #1Stock of the Day pick for free.Here are highlights from Tuesday's Analyst Blog:Top Research Reports for Today: JNJ, SLB, HON and MoreToday's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ-Free Report), Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB-Free Report) and Honeywell (NYSE:HON-Free Report).Johnson & Johnsonshares have gained +8.9% over the last year, widely outperforming the large-cap pharma space (down -1.1%). J&J reported mixed Q1 results, beating on earnings but missing on sales. This was the second consecutive sales miss for J&J due to a slowdown in pharmaceutical product sales.While the company is faced with a number of headwinds like unfavorable currency movements, increased competition from generics, pricing pressures and an uncertain global macroeconomic backdrop, the Zacks analyst believes that JNJ's diversified business model, deep product pipeline, lack of cyclicality and financial strength position it for continued momentum going forward.Also, the potential Actelion buyout, though expensive, will bolster J&J's long-term growth. However, in 2017, growth in J&J's Pharma segment is expected to suffer as key growth drivers have slowed down due to competition. (You canread the full research report on Johnson & Johnson here.)Shares ofSchlumbergerunderperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas Field Services industry over the last one year, losing -6.4% vs. the sector's -4.3% decline. The Zacks analyst likes the continuous and effective cost-management initiatives of the company. The Schlumberger-Cameron merger will support technology-driven growth, going forward. The company's focus on international markets also deserves appreciation.Moreover, Schlumberger's first-quarter earnings were in line with expectations. This may be attributed to improvement in directional drilling works in North America. However, the bottom line decreased substantially on a year-over-year basis owing to slowdown of drilling works in the international market. Moreover, Schlumberger projected 2017 to be a challenging year for business outside North America. (You canread the full research report on Schlumberger here.)Honeywellshares have outperformed the diversified operations industry gaining +12.1% vs. +2.1% in the year-to-date period. Moreover, Honeywell reported solid first-quarter 2017 results. The Zacks analyst like the company's continuing efforts on increasing its presence in high-growth regions. Additionally it is building a robust pipeline of new products and has regularly fine-tuned its portfolio to focus on core businesses.Diligent focus on working capital management, free cash flow generation and a conservative balance sheet remain key positive attributes. However, Honeywell expects a tepid demand pattern for its business jets and mobile scanners in 2017 due to sluggish global growth, volatility in crudeoil pricesand a tempered Chinese economy. High R&D expenditure to fend competition and stay ahead of technological obsolescence contracts margin and reduces bottom-line growth.

The 3 Best Dividend Stocks of the 2020s;4/26/2017;"Investing in soliddividend   stocksis arguably the most effective way to generate market-beating   returns over the long term. But those returns can be even more   lucrative for investors with the foresight to buy not just   dividend stocks that have outperformed in the past but also   companies that are positioned to deliver years of outsized gains   going forward.To help point you in that direction, we asked three top Motley   Fool contributors to each discuss what they believe will be one   of thebest dividend   stocksin the 2020s. Read on to learn why they choseUniversal Display(NASDAQ: OLED) ,Qualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM) , and Google parentAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) .IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.makeArticleAd();""A good place to start""Steve Symington(Universal Display):When Universal Display deliveredstrong fourth-quarter 2016 resultsin February, the OLED technologist also raised eyebrows all   around Wall Street by announcing its first-ever quarterly cash   dividend -- albeit at just $0.03 per share, which equates to   a minuscule 0.14% annual yield at today's prices.During the subsequent earnings conference call, however,   Universal Display CFO Sidney Rosenblatt offered some context on   the new dividend, by saying, ""Today's announcement reflects the   Board of Directors' confidence in Universal Display's robust   future growth opportunities, expected continued positive cash   flow generation, and commitment to return capital to our   shareholders.""When asked to clarify the company's stance during the Q&A   section of the call, Rosenblatt elaborated that the   $0.03-per-share payout is ""a good place to start,"" and further   insisted they ""intend to continue to pay regular dividends   quarterly going forward.""And why not? I'veargued beforethat Universal Display is still in the early stages of   its long-term growth story as its flagship OLED technology   becomes more ubiquitous. Not only is its OLED material and   intellectual property used in millions of smartphones fromSamsungand televisions fromLG-- which represent Universal Display's largest and second-largest   customers, respectively -- but it's also poised to become a   bigger part ofApple's repertoire (Apple Watch already uses OLED displays) with the   widely anticipated launch of the first OLED iPhone later this   year.In fact, shares of Universal Display climbed more than 5% on   Thursday to flirt with a fresh all-time high afterGoldman Sachsanalyst Brian Lee cited both the Apple developments and his   expectation that Samsung will convert to a more lucrative running   royalty agreement with UDC starting in 2019. In the end, as   Universal Display's business continues to take off into the   2020s, I suspect its dividend payout will inevitably follow   suit.Tech tailwinds and a chunky yieldKeith Noonan(Qualcomm):Research firm IDC estimates that the number of connected   devices will have increased from roughly 11 billion in 2016 to 80   billion in 2025, and semiconductor company Qualcomm is going to   play a big role in driving that growth. Between its dominance in   the mobile chip market, its recent push into the automotive   segment by way of acquiringNXP Semiconductors, and its development of low-power Wi-Fi chips for Internet of   Things devices, the company is on track to be a major beneficiary   of the connectivity boom. A study from LexInnova found that   Qualcomm has more high-value IoT patents than any other company,   so both its licensing and its hardware businesses are looking at   meaningful tailwinds as IoT ramps up.On the returned income side of things, Qualcomm already boasts   an attractive profile with its yield sitting at 4.3%, and its   14-year history of dividend growth suggests that investors can   count on payout increases down the line. Trading at roughly 11.5   times forward earnings estimates, the stock is also a potential   value play. A slew of legal challenges are depressing the   company's valuation, and while these issues do suggest real   downside risk, they also present the opportunity for investors to   buy into a stock that could be a huge winner over the next decade   and beyond at bargain prices.Qualcomm stock is something of a rarity in that it combines a   sizable dividend component, a cheap valuation, and ample growth   potential. With these characteristics in mind, I think it stands   out as one of the top dividend stocks to hold through the   2020s.Tech's future dividend kingTravis Hoium(Alphabet):Alphabet isn't a dividend stock today, but by the 2020s, I think   it is going to be one of the best dividend stocks on the market.   The company has a massive lead in search, which is incredibly   profitable and has adapted well in the shift from desktop to   mobile devices. It's this core business that's driven the   incredible cash flow machine you can see in the chart below.GOOG Free Cash Flow (TTM)data byYCharts.If free cash flow grows anywhere near the level you see above,   Alphabet could easily pay a 5% dividend yield by 2020. And that's   just from cash flow and doesn't include the cash pile it's   already sitting on.What makes Alphabet a potentially great dividend stock for the   2020s is the company's constant innovation. Whether it's   artificial intelligence, self-driving cars, or virtual reality,   it is constantly on the forefront. And with a cash flow machine   at the core of the business and multiple growth opportunities in   the lab, Alphabet will be generating enough money to pay a   dividend for a long time to come.10 stocks we like better than QualcommWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run     for over a decade,Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has tripled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy right now... and Qualcomm wasn't one of     them!

Tech Stock Earnings Due on Apr 27: MSFT, GOOGL, INTC, BIDU;4/26/2017;"The first-quarter earnings season is underway with results from 95 S&P 500 members or 24.9% of the index's total market capitalization already out (as of April 21). We expect around 800 companies to report results this week, including 191 S&P 500 members.Per the latestEarnings Preview, total earnings of these index members are up 14.3% year over year on the back of 4.6% higher revenues. Beat ratios are impressive with 72.6% surpassing earnings estimates and 62.1% coming ahead of revenue expectations.Total Q1 earnings are expected to rise 9.1% from the year-ago period on revenue growth of 6%. Five of 16 Zacks sectors are expected to witness a decline in earnings in the first quarter, with Conglomerates, Autos and Transportation being the biggest drag.This week, technology will be in the spotlight, as several major companies including MicrosoftMSFT, AlphabetGOOGLaka Google, IntelINTCand BaiduBIDUare slated to report their quarterly earnings on Apr 27. Let's see what's ahead for these four:Microsoft Corporation,one of the world's largest broad-based technology providers, is slated to release third-quarter fiscal 2017 results.According to our model, a company needs to have the right combination of two key ingredients, a positiveEarnings ESPand a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold), to increase its odds of an earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with ourEarnings ESP Filter.Consequently, we do not expect Microsoft to post an earnings beat since it carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Strong Sell) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Amazon continues to dominate the cloud computing market with Amazon Web Services trailed by Microsoft Azure. However, we believe that increasing competition from the likes of Alphabet, IBM, salesforce.com and Oracle will hurt Microsoft's market share going ahead.Moreover, sluggish IT spending is a major headwind for Microsoft. Notably, Microsoft results surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the preceding four quarters. It has an average four-quarter positive surprise of 8.55%.Microsoft Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseMicrosoft Corporation Price and EPS Surprise|Microsoft Corporation QuoteWe also don't expectAlphabet Inc., a leading provider of target-based advertisements on the web, to post an earnings beat when it reports first-quarter 2017 results.This is because the company has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy)   stocks here.However, Alphabet's top line is expected to benefit from the strength in the mobile platform. Also, YouTube remains a strong contributor benefiting from the increase in online video consumption.

Price and EPS SurpriseAlphabet Inc. Price and EPS Surprise|Alphabet Inc. QuoteSimilarly, we also don't expectIntel Corp., the world's largest manufacturer of semiconductor products, to outperform estimates when it reports first-quarter 2017 results. The company carries a Zacks Rank #4 and has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.We note that Intel's growing focus on areas with better growth prospects, such as the artificial intelligence, autonomous car and Internet of Things businesses are key catalysts. However, increasing competition in the data center market is a headwind. Also, sluggish PC market growth will continue to hurt Client Computing Group growth. (Read More:Intel to Report Q1 Earnings: What's in the Cards?)However, Intel's surprise history is impressive as it surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. It has an average four-quarter positive surprise of 9.11%.Intel Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseIntel Corporation Price and EPS Surprise|Intel Corporation QuoteWe again do not expectBaidu, Inc., a Chinese-language Internet search provider, to outperform estimates when it reports first-quarter 2017 results. The company has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.Baidu's growing presence in the online video market is likely to improve its competitive position. Also, the company's strong dominance in the mobile search market and its consistent product development efforts remain positives. The company continues to strengthen its offerings through various agreements in China, where it is pitted against the country's biggest e-Commerce operator, Alibaba Group Holding Limited.However, increasing competition on its own search platform and higher expenses incurred from new investments could affect top-line growth in the to-be-reported quarter.Baidu's surprise history is impressive as it surpassed estimates in all the last four quarters. It has an average four-quarter positive surprise of 36.89%.Baidu, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseBaidu, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise|Baidu, Inc.

Why Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock Is a Likely Short After Earnings;4/26/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) will report its quarterly earnings on Thursday, April 27, so today we'll be looking at the setup in MSFT stock.makeArticleAd();But I should point out that Thursday is a major day for large-cap tech earnings, and arguably for the near- to intermediate-term direction of theNasdaq-100. In addition to Microsoft,Alphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL),Amazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN),Baidu Inc (ADR)(NASDAQ:BIDU),Expedia Inc(NASDAQ:EXPE) andIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) are among the many big-tech firms dropping quarterly results after Thursday's bell.But I want to focus on Microsoft, because given the most recent multiday rally in MSFT stock to the top end of its trading channel, the Q3 earnings report and outlook could turn out to be an important ""show and tell"" event - and provide ample opportunities for traders to pounce on.Before looking at the trading opportunity, let's get some perspective. Microsoft shares make up about 8% of the Nasdaq-100, which frequently is represented by thePowerShares QQQ Trust, Series 1(ETF)(NASDAQ:QQQ). Amazon, Alphabet, Intel and Microsoft together make up about a quarter of the index.While it is entirely possible that given these companies' different businesses, their respective stock reactions to earnings could cancel each other out and thus lead to little movement for the Nasdaq-100, we at least have to consider what will happen if they trade in sync come Friday morning. Such a scenario could lead to a chart-altering move, and also likely jostle the broader U.S. stock market.MSFT Stock ChartsWhen I last discussed Microsoft on Jan. 24 - two days before its last earnings repor t- O offered that should the stock be able to overcome the $63.50 area, this could open upside toward $65-$66. Sure enough, MSFT popped after the Jan. 26 earnings report, and the $66 price target was reached within one day.3 Stocks to Sell Before They're Crushed by EarningsHowever, this area then acted as technical resistance … until Friday, April 21, anyway.On the multiyear weekly chart, we see that MSFT stock continues to grind higher and trade well above its 50-, 100- and 200-week simple moving averages (yellow, blue and red lines, respectively).Click to EnlargeWe also see that according to the MACD oscillator at the bottom of the chart, momentum thus far in 2017 is making a lower high versus the 2016 momentum highs.I personally won't assign too much credibility to this indicator alone. However, it is worth noting that MSFT stock is once again trading at the very upper end of the diagonal resistance line (upper purple-dotted line).On the daily chart, we see that on Friday, April 21, Microsoft stock finally managed to break past the $66 area and thus also past horizontal resistance. Over the past five trading days, this has now amounted to about a 5% rally, which is taking place just as Microsoft is set to report earnings on Thursday.Click to EnlargeWhile anything is possible, it's my experience that such rallies into earnings tend not to lead to sustainable rallies - even if the stock were to gap and rally higher following the earnings report.3 Stocks to Watch on Wednesday: Twitter Inc (TWTR), Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (CMG) and United States Steel Corporation (X)From a trading perspective, any post-earnings rally followed by a daily close well off the intraday highs would provide an opportunity to either short MSFT stock outright or sell out-of-the-money call spreads for income. The 50-day simple moving average (yellow) would become a first downside target. That line currently hovers around the $65 mark.Should MSFT stock gap and trade lower after earnings, you could assume a similar posture - as long as the stock closes near its daily low this Friday. But this situation would warrant a more cautious stance.Like what you see? Sign up for our dailyBeat the Belle-letter and get Serge's investment advice delivered to your inbox every morning!

E-Commerce Stocks' Q1 Earnings Due on Apr 27: AMZN, EXPE;4/26/2017;"The first-quarter earnings season is picking up pace, with results from 95 S&P 500 members or 24.9% of the index's total market capitalization already out (as of Apr 21). We expect almost 800 companies to report results this week, including 191 S&P 500 members.Per the latestEarnings Preview, total earnings of the index members that reported results were up 14.3% year over year on the back of 4.6% higher revenues. Beat ratios are impressive with 72.6% beating earnings estimates and 62.1% coming ahead of revenue expectations.Investors seem to be rejoicing as most of the companies have so far surpassed their estimates, particularly revenue estimates, in the first quarter. Also, growth rate is up from the preceding quarter and is on track to reach its highest level in almost three years. Continuation of these trends through the rest of this earnings season should serve as a reassuring development for the market.Total Q1 earnings are expected to rise 9.1% from the year-ago period on revenue growth of 6.0%. Five out of 16 Zacks sectors are expected to witness a decline in earnings in the first quarter, with Conglomerates, Autos and Transportation being the biggest drag.Technology will be in the spotlight this week, with several major companies including AlphabetGOOGLaka Google, Microsoft and Amazon, scheduled to report results.E-commerce is one of the most important components of the technology sector. The online trend continues to gather steam as the younger generation is rapidly adopting fast-advancing technology. Also, improvements in the mobile device segment have led the online companies to deliver strong numbers.Here, we take a sneak peek into two major e-commerce providers AmazonAMZNand ExpediaEXPEthat are lined up to report first-quarter earnings results on Apr 27:Amazon, the world's largest Internet retailer, delivered a positive earnings surprise of 10.0% last quarter. In fact, Amazon outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice in the last four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 25.68%.Per our proven model, a company must have the right combination of a favorable Zacks Rank (Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better) and a positiveEarnings ESPto pull off an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with ourEarnings ESP Filter.The Earnings ESP for Amazon is +4.90%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at $1.07 while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.02. The company also carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. Therefore, we are reasonably confident in looking for an earnings beat.

QuoteExpedia,a leading online travel companies in the world, however, is unlikely to beat first-quarter earnings estimates as it has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Strong Sell) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.(You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy)   stocks here.)Notably, Expedia missed the consensus mark in two out of the last four quarters, resulting in a positive average surprise of 6.29%.

Microsoft Stock: 3 Different Bear Cases You Haven't Thought Of;4/25/2017;"The shift to the cloud has treatedMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) well, and though the ubiquity of its software   means it is still a force to be reckoned with in personal   computers, there's now so much more to this tech giant, and   arguably, it's a lot more important.Yet as much of a tear as Microsoft has been on -- and not just   the past year, but the past five years, really -- there's good   reason to be mindful that there's always downside risk to a   stock. So, while there are some very well-worn cautions out there   about the company and its shares, we asked three Motley Fool   contributors to each share a bear case for Microsoft you might   not have thought about.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();The cloud may not be as profitable as you thinkTim Green(Commoditization of cloud infrastructure):Microsoft, along withAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) ,Alphabet's Google, and others, are pouring money into building massive   cloud data centers.Gartnerexpects the infrastructure-as-a-service market, currently led by   Amazon, to grow by nearly 37% this year, to $34.6 billion.Cloud computing is more complicated than just IaaS, where   virtual servers and storage are rented. Platform-as-a-service   provides an environment to develop applications without having to   manage the underlying infrastructure, and the various cloud   platforms offer differentiated sets of tools and features. But   IaaS is essentially a commodity. A virtual server from Amazon is   essentially the same as a virtual server from Microsoft. 100GB of   cloud storage from Amazon is the same as 100GB of cloud storage   from Microsoft.Demand for IaaS is growing so quickly that the major providers   are capable of producing some impressive profits. Amazon's AWS   managed a segment operating margin of 25% during 2016, for   example. But as the market matures, competition will get fiercer,   and that means even more aggressive price-cutting than we've   already seen. This market will ultimately be governed by supply   and demand, and once demand is no longer outpacing supply, it's   hard to imagine those lofty profit margins holding up.For Microsoft, this means that at least some of the billions   it is pouring into its cloud business may ultimately earn   lackluster returns -- far lower than its traditional software   business. Investors may not be taking that risk into account.Image source: Getty Images.A disruptive new gaming modelSteve Symington(The rise of ""console-free"" gaming):It's tempting to callSony's PlayStation 4 the biggest threat to Microsoft's gaming   business. After all, Sony grew the number of PS4 units sold by   15.5% year over year last quarter, to 9.7 million. Meanwhile,   Microsoft's gaming revenue declined 3% (down 1% at constant   currency), as lower Xbox console sales were only partially offset   by Xbox software and services revenue growth.However, I think an even larger threat to both systems looms   with the impending rise of console-free gaming. TakeNVIDIA's(NASDAQ: NVDA) on-demand GRID Gaming as a Service (GaaS)   solution, for example, which NVIDIA boasts can afford gamers   ""freedom from the console"" with high-quality, low-latency gaming   on any PC, Mac, smartphone, tablet, or TV. All you'll need is a   broadband internet connection. And because GRID renders the games   on NVIDIA's cloud servers, then encodes each frame and streams it   to the device, gamers won't be required to upgrade their local   hardware, don't need physical discs, and don't even need to   download or install the games they wish to play.To be fair, Microsoft is certainly capable of launching a   streaming game service like this through its Azure cloud   computing platform. In fact, some gamers have alreadyconfigured Azure instancesto stream their favorite AAA game titles, ironically taking   advantage of Azure's access to NVIDIA's powerful M60 GPUs in the   process. If Microsoft went down this path, though, it would lose   the lucrative revenue stream it currently enjoys by selling Xbox   gaming console hardware.At the same time, if it insists on sticking to its current   console-centric model -- something that seems likely given its   development of the next-generation Project Scorpio console --   Microsoft may be put in the difficult position of playing   catch-up as console-free gaming takes off in the coming   years.Image source: Getty Images.Pay nowandpay laterRich Duprey(More declining value assets):In the grand scheme of things, Microsoft's acquisition of   LinkedIn for $26 billion last year, while not chump change, won't   break the tech giant's bank, but it does serve to underscore what   it's getting right and what it's doing wrong -- and therein lies   some risk for the future.As a positive development, it does confirm Microsoft's   commitment to the business sector and the potential nexus between   the social media platform, its Office suite of products, its CRM   Dynamics software application, and the machine learning   capabilities of Azure. CEO Satya Nadella said as much a year ago,   when the deal was announced, when he described a ""rich   information graph"" that would form by connecting the dots between   LinkedIn's 433 million users, the 1.2 billion people using Office   products, and the 300 million devices running Windows 10.   Hopefully, all of the number-crunching will turn out something   useful.However, Microsoft doesn't have an enviable track record when   it comes to making acquisitions. For example, it ended up writing   off more in impairments and restructuring costs than the $9.4   billion it paid for Nokia. It also wrote off much of the $6.3   billion purchase price related to its acquisition of aQuantive in   2007, and it's hard to say what it gained from the $8.5 billion   it spent on Skype, or the $1.2 billion paid out for its other   foray into business social networking, Yammer.LinkedIn's user growth was slowing before the purchase, and   now that it's been rolled into Microsoft, we don't get those   numbers anymore. But the idea that yet another asset with   declining value has been added to the portfolio is hard to   shake.In the first full quarter that the platform has been a part of   Microsoft, it added $228 million in revenue, but experienced a   loss of $100 million in net income. Time will tell whether it was   a smart move, and most investors seem willing to be patient to   see how it works out, but the tech leader's willingness to spend   a lot of money on ventures that don't pan out, and often cost it   more in the end, is a risk investors need to consider.10 stocks we like better than MicrosoftWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

3 Tech Stocks Leading the Charge Past Nasdaq 6,000;4/25/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTheNasdaq Compositesurged past the 6,000 mark for the first time ever on Tuesday - hitting new highs for the first time since March - capping an epic gapped move higher. By gapped, I mean that stocks jumped above the prior day's range at the open and then extended its rise during trading. And for ""chartists"", that's a sign of serious, intense buying pressure.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockThe surge puts a dramatic end to a quiet two-month downtrend as investors burned off some of their post-election ebullience in calm, controlled fashion.Concerns focused on a lack of legislative progress from the Trump administration, weakness in ""hard"" economic data points like retail sales, a renewed decline in crude oil prices and geopolitical tension.While most of these remain in play - although President Trump is pushing hard on tax reform efforts this week - stocks had drifted enough that the situation was primed for a relief rally on any positive surprise catalyst. That was delivered on Sunday night after the first round of the French president election went as expected.10 Dividend Stocks That Will Deliver Double-Digit Returns Every YearWith that in mind, here are three big tech stocks driving the charge higher:Tech Stocks to Buy: Microsoft Corporation(MSFT)Microsoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) shares are rising up and out of a four-month consolidation range near the $66-level, popping to new highs. New leadership and a fresh focus on the cloud and changing to a software-as-a-service business model has helped MSFT nearly triple its share price from its 2013 lows.The company will next report results on April 27 after the close. Analysts are looking for earnings of 72 cents per share on revenues of $23.4 billion. RBC analysts are positive on MSFT shares as they see an improving server product cycle, good commercial cloud margins and modestly better PC demand.Tech Stocks to Buy: Alphabet Inc(GOOGL)Alphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) shares have pushed up and over its March high near $855 to push above $873.50 in trading Tuesday. This represents a near 70% rise form its summer 2015 high - an impressive run for a mature tech giant with diversified interests in everything from smartphone hardware and software to self-driving vehicle technology and virtual reality products.GOOGL has also successfully braved some advertiser losses from alleged ""hate channels"" on its YouTube platform.7 Healthcare Stocks With A-Rated ProspectsThe company will next report results on April 27 after the close. Analysts are looking for earnings of $7.57 per share of GOOGL on revenues of $19.7 billion.Tech Stocks to Buy: Facebook Inc(FB)Facebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) shares have ended a two-month sideways crawl with a big move to the upside, pushing the stock up nearly 30% from its late December low. The company was in the news recently for launching its Camera Effects Platform, which looks to make every smartphone camera enabled for augmented reality uses. FB stock was recently upgraded by analysts at Aegis Capital in anticipation of two big catalysts: New technology areas like VR/AR and messaging and the expectation of solid Q1 earnings.The company will next report results on May 3 after the close. Analysts are looking for earnings of $1.12 per share of FB on revenues of $7.8 billion.Anthony Mirhaydari is founder of theEdgeandEdge Proinvestment advisory newsletters.

Nasdaq Crosses 6000 For The First Time Ever: What This Means For Investors;4/25/2017;"NasdaqThe Nasdaq Composite Index, home to some of the world's largest technology and biotech companies, reached a milestone Tuesday, breaking for the 6,000 mark for the first time since its inception 46 years ago.What does 6,000 mean? Is it that different from, say, 5,780? Not really. But it presents an important moment of reflection. First and foremost is the obvious: We're in a bull market, which has now lasted about eight years since the market bottomed in the first quarter of 2009 amid the Great Recession of 2008. Investors' confidence stems from the fact that corporate earnings are on the rise, unemployment continues to fall, the housing market is still booming, and consumers (for the most part) are feeling somewhat better about their financial situation.makeArticleAd();All told, Nasdaq 6,000 -- as with when the index reached its last milestone of 5,000 in March 2000 -- says investors are in full-fledged ""risk-on"" mode. But the ""risk"" this time is founded on sound fundamentals and conservative investment principals. The fact that Warren Buffett recently double-downed on his Apple (AAPL) position near 52-week highs and bought shares of Sirius XM (SIRI) at under $5 bucks underscores how far along the market has come since Nasdaq first reached 5,000 seventeen years ago.A lot has changed since then. In 2017, compared to 2000, corporate balance sheets are scrutinized more closely and, unless your name is Amazon (AMZN) or Netflix (NFLX), P/E ratios matter more now than they did when XYZ.com and EIEIO.com were selling paper earnings. These days, we can see strong revenue and profit growth from companies like Google (GOOGL) or with Facebook (FB) leading the charge.Investors have also learned a lot in seventeen years. That's the optimist side in me talking, at least. I want to think we've learned since then. Besides Apple, Amazon, and Netflix, this time the Nasdaq is also being driven by the resurgence of software giant Microsoft (MSFT), which -- thanks to its cloud transformation -- is operating on all cylinders.Ultimately, Nasdaq 6,000 was reached thanks to products like social networking, the iPhone, the cloud, online advertising, breakthrough biotech innovation, among other technologies. As with each milestone, there's the obligatory question of: ""What's next?""Nasdaq 7,000 is a matter of ""when"" not ""if."" My crystal ball says it won't take seventeen years to gain 1,000 points. The milestone will likely be reached thanks to, at least in part, autonomous cars. And this puts names like Tesla (TSLA) in the drivers seat. In that vein, another name investors should keep an eye on is Intel (INTC), which recently picked off Israeli self-driving technology company Mobileye (MBLY) for$15.3 billion.With innovative tech companies steering Nasdaq into the 21st century, Tuesday's milestone is merely a checkpoint on the quest to help companies create, or maximize, their value."

Google and PayPal Join Forces on Digital Payments;4/25/2017;"As smartphones rose to prominence, one of the expected side   effects was increasing adoption of the digital wallet -- apps on   a smartphone designed to store credit card information and used   to facilitate mobile payments. Turns out that consumers are   creatures of habit and the rate of adoption has been slower than   expected. Consumers have become accustomed to swiping credit or   debit cards and aren't ready to switch just yet.A recent report byStatistarevealed that just 14% of U.S. consumers had used a mobile   payment to make a purchase in 2016, though that number is   expected to grow to 18% in 2017 and to 37% by 2021. The   transaction value of these payments totaled $24 billion in the   U.S. last year.PayPal joins forces with Google in the digital wallet. Image     source: PayPal.makeArticleAd();Rivals become partnersSeeking to get their share of this nascent opportunity,PayPal Holdings, Inc.(NASDAQ: PYPL) andAlphabet Inc.'s(NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG)  Google are joining forces.   The partnership will allow users to link their PayPal account to   Android Pay, Google's mobile payments platform. The companies are   expanding on a collaboration that started nearly three years ago,   with PayPal being added as a payment option for Google Play, the   company's online app store.Consumers upload their credit card information into a digital   wallet app in their phone, which allows users to pass their   smartphone over a terminal equipped with near-field   communications technology rather than swiping or inserting their   credit card. These mobile payment systems use one-time-only   codes, rather than the card number, making them a more secure   form of payment. Ironically, worries about personal data and fear   of fraud are the most cited reasons among consumers who have not   yet used mobile payments, according to Statista.Image source: Google.Expanding its footprintPayPal, whose service got its start as a secure payment option   on websites, has been partnering with a growing number of   companies to expand its footprint. Over the past year, PayPal has   announced deals with major credit card processorsVisa Inc.,Mastercard Incorporated, and most recentlyDiscover Financial Services, along with a host of other providers. PayPal believes that by   partnering with other companies it will provide more choices to   consumers.Google is hoping to increase adoption of its mobile-payment   service, which has been lagging competitorApple, Inc.(NASDAQ: AAPL) in the digital-wallet space. Statista reports that   while 12% of consumers have used Apple Pay for a transaction,   only 9% have used Android pay, and 6% have usedSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) Pay, the other major smartphone-based mobile   wallet. The principal reason for its lead is availability. Apple   Pay is accepted at 36% of U.S. merchants, followed by Android Pay   at 24%, and Samsung Pay at third with 18%.Coffee to goStarbucks Corporation(NASDAQ: SBUX) boasts one of the most popular store-only mobile   payments. The company launched its app in 2011, one of the first   such hybrid programs joining a mobile-payment app with a   customer-loyalty program. Statista reports that mobile payments   accounted for 25% of all Starbucks' transactions in the United   States. The coffee purveyor has taken things a step further with   its Mobile Order & Pay program, by allowing customers to   order and pay in advance and pick up their purchase without   waiting in a register line. Starbucks recently announced the   opening of a location at the company's Seattle headquarters that   will only accept ordering and payments via mobile.Beginning of a trendWe are still early in the adoption cycle, and as digital   wallet technology becomes more pervasive, companies are vying for   their share of the proceeds. These transactions are expected to   grow at a rate of 52% annually to $866 billion by 2021. The   digital payment space is highly fragmented, with a host of   options available to consumers. These partnerships and innovative   solutions are only the beginning of a trend that will be years in   the making.10 stocks we like better than Alphabet (A   shares)When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Will Alphabet (GOOGL) Surprise Investors in Q1 Earnings?;4/25/2017;"Alphabet Inc.GOOGLwill report first-quarter 2017 earnings on Jan 27 after the bell.The surprise history has been decent in Alphabet's case. The company missed estimates twice in the last four quarters but has an average four-quarter positive surprise of 2.71%.Coming to the price performance, over the past one year, shares of Alphabet steadily treaded higher. The stock returned 18.4% compared with the Zacks categorizedInternet Servicesindustry's gain of 11.3%.What Happened in the Last Reported Quarter?Alphabet's fourth-quarter earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate due to higher taxes. However, revenues grew year over year, driven primarily by the boom in Mobile Search, with the ongoing strength in YouTube. Also, strength in programmatic advertising and Play aided revenue growth.Factors at Play in Q1The main drivers of the Google business haven't changed. Pricing remains under pressure, both on account of the ongoing FX concerns as well as continued strength in mobile and TrueView. Volumes are however encouraging as total paid click grew a reassuring 36% last quarter.Google has gained strength in the mobile platform. Management is focused on driving mobile experiences and the company is well positioned to pick up strong intent-to-buy signals as a result of studying mobile searches from its huge database. As a result, revenue from mobile platform is expected to increase in the to-be-reported quarter.YouTube remains a strong contributor benefiting from the increase in online video consumption. More than a thousand creators are currently engaged with the platform, bringing in a thousand subscribers every day.Also, Google has turned more aggressive in the commercialization of its self-driving cars. It aims to expand its revenues from this segment in the to-be-reported quarter. However, the current regulatory environment doesn't support fully automated cars, so there could be some hurdles on the way.Google's cloud business trails Amazon's AWS, Microsoft's Azure and IBM. The company's cloud business is expected to do well in the to-be reported quarter. And finally, Google platforms like Android, Chrome and Daydream continue to help it draw more users and sell more ads.On a cautionary note, Google's troubles in the EU are mounting. Despite its attempts to appease authorities by investing in the region, EU may prove much more expensive for the company. Google is not providing for this outflow, which could mean that it still has a reasonable chance of coming out victorious. But the developments are worth keeping an eye on as these are the main reasons for the overhang on the company's shares.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not show that Alphabet will beat on earnings this third quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positiveEarnings ESPand a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.The company's Zacks Rank #3 and Earnings ESP of 0.00% make surprise prediction difficult. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with ourEarnings ESP Filter.We don't recommend Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement.Alphabet Inc.

Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock: A Sure Thing Before Earnings;4/25/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) is on fire of late as it just set a new all-time high. When a stock is rallying this fast, it becomes uncomfortable to chase. Even though it looks like we missed the GOOGL stock trade, it's still possible to participate in whatever is left of the upside potential.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockWithin the past two weeks I shared a trade on how to buy GOOGL stock for a discount, and thetrade delivered $6 in free profitswith zero down. Today, I want to basically rinse and repeat, but for a different time frame and a bigger buffer for the earnings event.Alphabet's prospects are beyond reproach as it dominates the search arena with several other assets that have over a billion users each that are yet to be monetized. Even the self driving car effort that once sounded like science fiction is now closer to reality than ever. The bottom line is that it will take several disasters to trip up this giant for long.7 Blue-Chip Stocks Every Investor Should OwnI am a fundamental investor and GOOGL fundamentals are as solid as I like them to be. I am also a conservative trader, however, so I am not about to risk $879 per share without any room for error. To make matters worse, Alphabet reports earnings this week, and for the short term, the reactions to earnings are more gambling than investing.Click to EnlargeTechnically, there is not much to decipher from an all-time high starting point. So for that I am forced to take my position long into the options market instead of the equity itself.This way I can risk much less and still participate to the upside. To a degree, the percentage moves in the options are much bigger than that of the actual stock provided we guess the direction correctly.The Bet:Sell the GOOGL Dec $600 put. This is a bullish trade for which I collect $4 to open. I have a 90% theoretical chance of success. If GOOGL stock falls below my sold put I will be put the stock and suffer losses below $596 per share so I only do this if I am willing to own it there.Changing this trade into a credit put spread instead would make it suitable to more investors because the spread carries a finite risk profile much smaller than that of a short naked put.The Alternate:Sell the GOOGL Dec $600/$580 credit put spread which also carries a 90% chance of success in which case it would yield 4% on risk. This sounds boring but it's by design after all the risk has a 30% buffer from current price.Learn options as easy as 1-2-3 in a personal 1on1 webinarhere.

Stock Market News for April 25, 2017;4/25/2017;"Benchmarks finished in the green on Monday, following the victory of centrist candidate Emmanuel Macron in the first round of the French presidential election. The surge in shares of JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs boosted the Dow. Meanwhile, investors kept a close watch on quarterly earnings results with AlphabetGOOGLand MicrosoftMSFTscheduled to report their earning results this week.For a look at the issues currently facing the markets, make sure to read today'sAhead of Wall Streetarticle.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) advanced 1.1% to close at 20,763.89. The S&P 500 rose 1.1% to close at 2,374.15. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index gained 1.2% to a record close at 5,983.82, after hitting an all-time high on an intraday. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) declined 26.0% to 10.82, marking its biggest one day percentage drop since August, 2011. A total of around 3.7 billion shares were traded in NYSE on Monday. Advancers outpaced declining stocks on the NYSE. For 68% stocks that advanced, 29% declined.First Round Presidential Election OutcomeAfter a close contest, centrist candidate Emmanuel Macron and far-right candidate Marine Le Pen emerged as top contenders for the final round of the presidential election in France scheduled to be held on May 7. The outcome of the final round of the contest between Marine Le Pen and Macron will ultimately have a major bearing on the future of the European Union. In the first round of the French presidential election on Sunday, Macron was ahead with 23.9% of the vote, compared to his closest competitor, euro skeptic candidate Marine Le Pen, who secured 21.4% of the vote.Meanwhile, a poll released by Ipsos/Sopra Steria on Sunday indicated Macron was leading Le Pen, 62% to 38%. Moreover, socialist Benoît Hamon and conservative François Fillon later decided to support Macron. Earlier, Marine Le Pen had called for exiting the Euro, leading to fears of a possible ""Frexit"". A Frexit will cause significant geopolitical instability in the Euro zone as France is an essential of both the Eurozone and the European Union. Macron's lead helped to reduce the prospect of such an outcome.Macron's victory in the first round not only contributed to gains for European equities but also lifted investor confidence in the U.S. which ultimately had a positive impact on the broader markets.Dow Boosted by J.P. Morgan Chase and Goldman   SachsShares of JPMorgan Chase & Co.JPMand Goldman SachsGSsurged 3.5% and 2.9% respectively which boosted the Dow.

The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights: Apple, Alphabet, Ford and Tesla;4/25/2017;"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL - April 25, 2017 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog includeApple(NASDAQ:AAPL-Free Report),Alphabet(NASDAQ:GOOGL-Free Report),Ford(NYSE:F-Free Report) andTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA-Free Report).Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations.Get #1Stock of the Day pick for free.Here are highlights from Monday's Analyst Blog:Will Self-Driving Cars Push Apple (AAPL) to New Highs?Reuters said thatApple(NASDAQ:AAPL-Free Report) has ""outlined"" a plan to ""train"" self-driving car operators, giving an insight into its closely guarded self driving car/technology efforts. Reuters cited documents released exclusively to it by California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV).For a while now, there has been tremendous speculation about Apple's autonomous car technology development efforts, which is apparently codenamed Project Titan. As usual, Apple has refrained from commenting on the matter so far as it loves to maintain secrecy regarding projects it's working on.Per latest report from Reuters, Apple's 41 page application submitted to DMV, CA, comprises a 10 page training plan that includes a document called ""Automated System: Development Platform Specific Training Overview."" The objective of Automated System: Development Platform Specific Training Overview is ""to train safety drivers in various automated driving conditions,"" Reuters further adds. However, these documents don't reveal a lot of things, like the kind of sensors attached to the vehicles or the self driving car platform mechanism.Last week, it was reported that Apple had secured a permit to test self-driving vehicles. The permit is issued to test drive three vehicles (2015 Lexus RX450h models) with two drivers each, added DMV.Apple's Project Titan has been in the news since 2014-2015. Initially, it was reported that Apple was working on an ""iCar."" There were numerous reports of the company making sound talent acquisitions as well as collaborating with the likes of BMW for the car design. VP of Product Design, Steve Zadesky was permitted to set up a 1K strong workforce for the project.Later on, the ""iCar"" rumors lost steam as the project was reportedly marred by conflicts and management troubles. Following this, Apple decided to prune some of its 1K strong workforce assigned to the project. In Jan 2016, with the resignation of Zadesky, things became more blurred. However, reportedly, Bob Mansfield was brought on board to once again spearhead the project in July 2016.It is now speculated that Apple may not be designing a full fledged car but an autonomous self driving car technology platform.Apple's fortunes remain tied to its flagship offering, iPhone, at least in the near term. With iPhone 7 and 7 Plus performing relatively well and the excitement building up for iPhone 8 (dubbed as a super cycle), Apple can breathe easy.However, increasing competition from cheaper handsets is emerging as a big concern. Apple is under great pressure to introduce new products. Apple Pay, Apple Watch, Apple Music are some of the new ventures undertaken by the company.Also, revenues from App Store are growing. Apple is also working on developing technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and augmented reality/ virtual reality (AR/VR), which are fast emerging as lucrative business opportunities. The company's interest in the autonomous car project is understandable as this is now being labeled as a big business opportunity.According to Boston Consulting Group estimates, the autonomous car market will be worth $42 billion by 2025 and $77 billion by 2035. Per Statista, the market for fully autonomous vehicles will grow to almost $6 billion while partially autonomous vehicles market will reach $36 billion by 2025.Self-driving technology gained immense importance in the past few years with tech and auto behemoths like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL-Free Report), Ford (NYSE:F-Free Report), Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA-Free Report), Volkswagen AG, Daimler AG, Uber and Lyft directing resources to develop this technology.However, analysts are skeptical about self-driving cars being feasible before 2020, at least.Zacks Rank and Stock Price MovementCurrently, Apple has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Amazon's Alexa Just Took Another Step Toward World Domination;4/25/2017;"As the science of artificial intelligence (AI) becomes more   advanced and deeply ingrained in our daily lives, society gets   closer to some of the iconic examples of AI from science fiction.Star Trekfans will remember the captain using a voice command to   engage the ship's mainframe on the StarshipEnterprisesimply by saying ""Computer.""Amazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ: AMZN) recently added a new wake word to its   Alexa-enabled Echo and Echo Dot smart speaker system, which   amused and delighted fans of the pop-culture phenomenon. Now all   thoseStar Trekfans will be able to engage with the digital assistant by saying   ""Computer."" It's a fitting tribute, as theStar Trekcomputer was the inspiration for the development of Amazon's   voice-controlled digital assistant. While this Easter egg may   have thrilled sci fi fans, developers were elated to find that   Amazon is once again opening up Echo's technology to third-party   developers.Echo far-field voice recognition technology will be     available to outside developers. Image source: Amazon.com,     Inc.makeArticleAd();Far-field voice recognitionOne of the innovations that has made the Echo so successful is   the far-field voice-recognition capabilities of the smart   speaker. The seven-microphone circular array combines a number of   technologies, including beamforming, noise reduction, echo   cancellation, and voice processing, which allows the Echo to hear   commands across a crowded room.As part of Amazon's vision for Alexa to be everywhere, the   company is providing exclusive, invitation-only access to the   technology behind its microphone array and voice processing and   will allow third-party device makers to incorporate Echo's   know-how into their own products. Through the Alexa Voice Service   Program, Amazon is offering a hardware reference package that   bundles the technology for use by partners and not charging for   the privilege.Amazon's advantageIf you think altruism is behind this gesture, think again.   Consumers are able to access Amazon's music streaming service and   make purchases on the e-commerce website using Alexa voice   commands. Amazon also benefits by having the technology accessed   by as many consumers as possible, as its AI-based voice   recognition technology improves the more it is used.This isn't the first time Amazon has permitted the embedding   of Alexa technology into other manufacturers' products. The   company worked with a number of hardware developers beginning in   June 2015 and has more than 40 partners, with products from   speakers to smartwatches, and from cars to refrigerators.Alexa in the cloudAmazon is also pursuing other avenues to make its voice   service ubiquitous. The company just announced that it will make   this technology available to its cloud-computing customers.   Amazon Web Services (AWS) the company's cloud-computing service,   will provide access to Amazon Lex, Alexa's AWS alter-ego, to   create their own chat bots. These artificially intelligent   software programs provide verbal or text interactions with   consumers in a way that is designed to emulate a human being and   are seen quite often in a messaging context.Google Home directly competes with Echo. Image source:     Google.No phone to call her ownAmazon has been at a disadvantage in the virtual-assistant   market, having missed out on the opportunity in mobile, as Alexa   doesn't have a phone to call her own, likeApple, Inc.'s(NASDAQ: AAPL) Siri andAlphabet Inc.'s(NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) Google Assistant. This is the   latest in a number of moves designed to establish a beachhead in   the area of voice control. The company hopes to achieve an   insurmountable installed base of devices to fend off competition   from these other virtual assistants.Google's release of the Home smart speaker is the first direct   competitor to the Echo, and Google has the advantage of its   massive search capabilities and a foundation of millions of   Android-based smartphones. While Apple hasn't announced its   intention to produce a smart speaker, there have been unconfirmed   reports that one is in development. Apple is known for coming   late to market with a superior product and stealing market share,   so it could take the same approach here.Meanwhile, the company has been hard at work integrating Siri   across the breadth of Apple's devices. Not only can Siri be   accessed on Apple's flagship iPhones, but it has also been   enabled on the iMac, MacBook Pro, and MacBook Air. In another   moved designed to make Siri omnipresent, users can access her by   giving two taps on one of Apple's branded AirPods.Amazon has the edge -- for nowAmazon's advantage rests not only in being first to market   with its device, but also in the multitude of Alexa commands or   skills, numbering over 10,000. RBC Capital Market's Mark Mahaney   and Jim Shaughnessy estimate that 17% of consumers have ordered   products from Amazon's website using their Alexa-based device,   which could result in an additional $10 billion in sales annually   by 2020. Add to that an ever-increasing installed base of   Alexa-enabled devices, and Amazon is one step closer to world   domination.10 stocks we like better than AmazonWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Here's the list of the   nation's 12 most charitable companies, according toThe Chronicle of Philanthropy'smid-2016 report(registration required), along with some of the causes   these companies are giving to.Image source: ExxonMobil.12. ExxonMobilFirst up is the oil and gas behemothExxonMobil(NYSE: XOM) , which gave more than a quarter of a billion dollars   in 2015 alone (the most recent year for which data is available).   The company has spread its donation efforts across various areas,   from education to global health initiatives to malaria   prevention. ExxonMobil also has a program to donate $500 on   behalf of an employee for every 20 hours the employee   volunteers.Goldman Sachs employees volunteering in Bangalore in 2016.

That's the image   of big banks that's often played up in the media, but it turns   out thatGoldman Sachs(NYSE: GS) is one of the biggest corporate givers in   America. Goldman Sachs Gives,a donor-advised fund, has given more than $1 billion in   grants to thousands of nonprofits in 80 countries worldwide.A community knowledge center in Kenya.

Cisco SystemsCisco Systems(NASDAQ: CSCO) is already using its data and cloud computing   technology to help develop ""smart cities"" around the world in   places like Copenhagen, Denmark. But the company also uses its   funding and technology to build ""Community Knowledge Centers"" in   areas that lack internet access, such as in Kenya, as shown in   the image above. These centers allow local residents to connect   to online resources such as skills training. Cisco's management   believes investments like these are critical to ending the cycle   of poverty in these areas.Image source: Wells Fargo.9. Wells FargoWhileWells Fargo(NYSE: WFC) has certainly come under public scrutiny over its   problematic account-selling tactics in the last few months, the   company has long been regarded as one of the most charitable   for-profit organizations in the U.S. Wells Fargo supports   hundreds of local nonprofits in the cities where it operates, as   well as large national nonprofits that are involved in financial   education and much more. Wells Fargo management announced its   2020 economic goals last year, and they include $500 million in   philanthropic spending by 2020.Image source: Eli Lilly.8. Eli Lilly and CompanyEli Lilly(NYSE: LLY) is the maker of important pharmaceutical products   like Prozac and insulin. It's also the parent of the Eli Lilly   Foundation, which awards grants for philanthropic   initiatives in the areas of quality healthcare in low- and   middle-income countries, as well as public education in the   United States, with an emphasis on science and math. The   foundation also matches millions of dollars' worth of employee   donations each year.Image source: Bristol-Myers Squibb.7. Bristol-Myers SquibbHealthcare companyBristol-Myers Squibb(NYSE: BMY) says on its website that it seeks ""to improve   the health outcomes of populations disproportionately affected by   serious diseases"" through increasing healthcare worker capacity   and integrated medical care. The company recently announced a $50   million donation (matched with another $50 million from other   donors) in a new public-private partnership with the   government of Botswana to treat children with cancer and blood   disorders.Microsoft employee Prashant Gupta in India.

MicrosoftMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) founder Bill Gates is not only one of the   wealthiest people in the world, but also one of the most   charitable -- he's the co-founder of the Bill and Melinda Gates   Foundation, which has donated tens of billions toward the cause   of improving healthcare and relieving poverty around the world.   Microsoft seems to hold similar values, as the company notes that   it donates nearly $2 million per day in cash and equipment. Its   philosophy is that technology can help humankind overcome some of   the greatest challenges it faces. In the image above, a Microsoft   employee helps farmers in India use technology to better time   their crops during a drought.Google Cardboard headset being used to help veterans     virtually attend a Veterans Day Parade.

AlphabetAlphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL)  philanthropic efforts   include donating its own services -- for example, it gives   nonprofits free access to Google Adwords for advertising, and   trains military veterans to learn new technologies as they   transition to civilian jobs. The company also launches bold   technological ventures that are meant to take dramatic steps   toward solving the world's problems. For instance, the company   provides funding and expertise to groups that can use the Google   Earth tool to fight global deforestation.Image source: Wal-mart.4. WalmartWal-Mart(NYSE: WMT) is the world's largest retailer by sales, and it also   holds the spot as the largest donor in the retail industry. The   company gives cash and product donations to nonprofits working on   labor benefits, food for those in need, and much more. The   company also sends aid to communities in the U.S. that are   affected by natural disasters. In December it gave $250,000   toward relief and recovery efforts in areas of Tennessee that   were being ravaged by wildfires.Image source: Merck & Company.3. Merck & CompanyMerck & Co., a leading healthcare company, donates both   cash and medical resources, particularly within the communities   where the company operates. It also aids in global initiatives to   take on cancer, diabetes, hepatitis C, and HIV/AIDS. The   company notes on its website that it donated $1.7 billion worth   of products in 2015 alone.Image source: Getty Images.2. Gilead SciencesThe second-largest corporate donor as of 2016 isGilead Sciences(NASDAQ: GILD) . Gilead is one of the leaders in HIV/AIDS   pharmaceuticals. Its products include a medication called   Truvada, a form of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) that blocks   the virus from spreading between individuals. The company's top   philanthropic priority is ending the global HIV/AIDS epidemic and   making life-saving healthcare accessible in areas of need.Image source: Pfizer.1. PfizerThe most charitable Fortune 500 company in America isPfizer(NYSE: PFE) . This healthcare company, which makes famous drugs   like Viagra and Lipitor, seeks to build out healthcare   opportunities for those in underserved communities worldwide   through ""people, products, and funding."" As part of this goal,   the company helps to fund programs that increase awareness   of non-communicable diseases and that remove barriers   preventing women and children from receiving sufficient   care.If there's any doubt as to whether it's possible to reward   shareholders while leading the nation in charitable giving,   consider that the shares of these 12 companies gained an average   of 78% over the last five years, compared with 67% for theS&P 500. We look forward to seeing which companies have increased their   own corporate giving when the next edition ofThe Chronicle of Philanthropy's most charitable companies is released.10 stocks we like better than Wal-MartWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock     tip, it can pay to listen.

These 3 Tech Giants Are More Involved in Gaming Than You Think;4/24/2017;"Video games don't get the headlines for technology giants likeFacebook(NASDAQ: FB) ,Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) , andAmazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) , but make no mistake -- these companies are   aggressively competing to control a meaningful share of the $100   billion video game industry.The video game industry is growing about 6% per year, with   mobile gaming serving as one of the key drivers of that growth.   In addition to mobile gaming, two new markets -- e-sports and   virtual reality (VR) -- are small but growing fast.IMAGE SOURCE: PIXABAY.makeArticleAd();Game developers need the cloudPeople are beginning to spend as much time playing games as   they do on social media or on streaming services likeNetflix. One reason is that technology advancements on smartphones and   tablets are gradually making mobile games more complex, like   console or PC games. But, this growth in mobile gaming is placing   a burden on game developers without the expertise to provide   online infrastructure that can support the huge spikes in usage   when new updates or content are released for a particular   game.Developers are turning to cloud solutions to split the   processing burden of a game between cloud servers and the mobile   device. The results: a much smoother gaming experience for the   player, and more demand for cloud providers such as Alphabet's   Google Cloud Platform andAmazon Web Services.The mobile gaming market generated nearly 40% of the total   video game industry's revenue in 2016, and revenue from mobile   gaming increased 18% in 2016, to about $40 billion. Mobile is   expected to be a key driver of the industry's growth for the   foreseeable future.E-sportsThe concept of someone paying to go to a venue to watch others   compete in a video game might seem strange to most, but this is a   $1 billion market that isgrowing fast.The global e-sports audience is estimated to be 385 million   and could grow to 500 million by 2020, according to Newzoo.   Because the great majority of e-sports fans watch competitions   online, the e-sports opportunity plays right into the hands of   companies like Alphabet and Facebook that already have social   platforms in place to connect people with content.Amazon, however, took a big step ahead when it acquired   Twitch.tv for $970 million in 2014. Twitch is a platform where   users can live-stream their PC games to other gaming enthusiasts,   and it has a staggering 100 million monthly viewers. The   game streaming site also broadcasts e-sports tournaments around   the world. Competition between Twitch and Alphabet's YouTube has   become tense lately. Through 2016, Twitch had an important   partnership with ESL -- the world's largest e-sports company --   to broadcast e-sports events. However, ESL recently moved   exclusively to YouTube, a sign that YouTube is gaining ground on   Twitch.And then there's Facebook, with its network of 1.2 billion   daily users. There's no doubt Facebook could be a sleeping giant   in e-sports viewing, but it has a ways to go to catch up to its   competitors. Unlike Twitch and YouTube, Facebook has no dedicated   streaming page for gaming.The social-media giant is making progress with its recent   release of the Facebook Live video feature for computers, after   only being available on its mobile app. This will allow gamers to   stream live gameplay to followers, but it lacks the monetization   features provided by Twitch and YouTube for popular game   streamers.Virtual RealityWhile Facebook is trailing YouTube and Twitch in e-sports,   Facebook is investing heavily in VR, which is expected to become   a $45 billion market by 2025, according to Grand View Research.   The social-media giant purchased Oculus -- the maker of the Rift   headset -- for $2 billion in 2014.Oculus, Alphabet,Sony,Samsung Electronics, andHTCall shipped VR headsets in 2016, and the combined results appear   to have fallen below expectations, but that really depends on who   you talk to.Company executives likeNVIDIACEO Jensen Huang and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg expressed   satisfaction with the first year of the VR market. NVIDIA   develops the powerful graphics processors that help gamers play   the more graphically intense VR games. Jensen Huang recently told   analysts on a conference call:The first year of VR has sold several hundred thousand     units.The early VR is really targeted at early adopters. And I     think the focus of ensuring an excellent experience that     surprises people ... has really been a good focus ... I think     the first year was absolutely a great success.Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, on a recent conference call,   made it clear that Oculus would probably not be profitable for   quite some time, as the company continues to invest in VR   development:I don't think that there is really a strategy to pull this     in from ten years to five ... I would ask for the patience of     the investor community in doing that, because we're going to     invest a lot in this, and it's not going to return or be really     profitable for us for quite a while.The technology promises not only to deliver a new immersive   gaming experiences, but also to change the way people communicate   with each other. However, it's not likely to catch for a while,   at least until headsets get cheaper.The video game industry has a solid ecosystemThe video game industry isdoing wellon its own, with the investment put into it by game publishers   likeActivision BlizzardandElectronic Arts. But social-media giants and Amazon committing resources to the   industry is a great sign for the future of gaming.10 stocks we like better than Alphabet (A     shares)When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

I also think calling these stocks ""blue chips"" does a disservice to investors, though.Most of these companies are well past their heyday. Most are low- to no-growth companies that pay out meager dividends. While you shouldn't necessarily expect breakneck growth from extremely large companies, you also shouldn't settle for kibble.I typically view blue-chip stocks as companies that continue to grow earnings at 8% annually at more, have tons of free cash flow, lots of cash on hand, and still are future-looking - not backward-looking.10 Dividend Stocks That Will Deliver Double-Digit Returns Every YearWith that in mind, here are seven blue-chip stocks that deserve a spot in every long-term diversified portfolio.Blue-Chip Stocks Every Investor Should Own: Cardinal Health (CAH)Source:Via WikimediaI want to start out with a stock that doesn't get much play in lists of blue-chip stocks:Cardinal Health, Inc.(NYSE:CAH). It's not small by any means, at $22 billion in market cap - it's just not a first-to-mind name when it comes to big, no-doubt stocks.That doesn't mean thishealthcare stockdoesn't belong.I like Cardinal Health because it deals in distribution, not manufacturing. Distribution is where the money is. Corporations similar to CAH have both footprint and infrastructure, and therefore can get their healthcare supplies to where they need to go for maximum profitability.Hence the reason I love distribution. Quality control isn't an issue. It's just about using an established network to get items where they need to go when they need to be there. And with a 24,000-pharmacy network to distribute to, CAH has plenty of customers. Besides all forms of drugs, it also takes care of logistics, managing inventory and so on.Cardinal Health has been growing at 10% annually on average, and is expected to do the same over the next five years. I also love that CAH generated more than $2.4 billion in free cash flow last year, and only uses 20% of operating cash flow to pay its 2.5%-yielding dividend.Blue-Chip Stocks Every Investor Should Own: Apple (AAPL)Source:Beni Krausz via UnsplashNow, let's move on to a blue-chip stock that typically makeseverylist of blue-chip stocks to buy:Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL).Apple is the premiere name in blue-chip stocks. The company has almost $250 billion in cash and investments. You can grouse about most of it being parked overseas, but even ifApple never gets a big repatriation holiday courtesy of President Donald Trump, that's still plenty of ammunition once taxes are taken out.Although Apple still generates the majority (60%-plus) of its revenues from its iPhone, and that is a concern, I get the feeling that shareholders are content with what Tim Cook is doing as a game manager. Maybe it's the fact that AAPL is up nearly 25% year-to-date. Maybe it's the fact that Apple is near all-time highs.8 Retail Stocks That Can Win Despite AmazonI'd like to see more vision, but Apple stock has so much margin of safety that if you plan to own it for a long time, you'll do fine - and you'll do even better ifCongress lowers the corporate tax rate to 15%.Blue-Chip Stocks Every Investor Should Own: Chevron (CVX)Source:swong95765 via Flickr (Modified)There are certain brands and companies - and even entire sectors - that are so intrinsic to human life that it's foolish not to invest in that arena.In this case, oil still is a slam dunk.Yes, alternative energy continues to creep forward, but oil remains king, and will for decades to come. And yes, the oil market is always going to be volatile, but that's exactly why big producers likeChevron Corporation(NYSE:CVX) are the place to be. They have the scale and cash flow to maintain flexibility and survive even the worst of times.Frankly, any of thebig energy stocksare fine, but for now, I like Chevron's upside better than the others. It's loaded with cash, it has been wise with its capex spending, and it survived the oil downturn without having to touch its dividend (which, by the way, yields more than 4% right now).The past couple years haven't exactly been fun, but CVX has survived. Now, it's poised to recover anytime oil prices do.Blue-Chip Stocks Every Investor Should Own: Microsoft (MSFT)Source: ShutterstockMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) is another mainstay of blue-chip stock lists, and it truly does belong there.That's because it offers safety - Microsoft sits on a cash hoard of some $130 billion, and has insanely consistent free cash flow of $25 billion annually. It can even afford to pay out half of that as a dividend.And under Satya Nadella, the company also fits my criterion of growing at 8% or more. MSFT is astoundingly ""growthy"" right now - something many analysts didn't think was possible just a few short years ago.The Nadella-led Microsoft now has vision once more. It's not exactly the high-flying story it was in the 1990s, but it doesn't have to be to make you money. All it has to do is execute - and it is.7 Short Squeeze Stocks That Will Be Shot Into OrbitI also wonder what MSFT can still do with all that cash. As the $26.5 billion acquisition of LinkedIn shows,surprise mega-acquisitions are not out of the picture.Blue-Chip Stocks Every Investor Should Own: Alphabet (GOOGL)Source: ShutterstockIt takes something special to be considered a ""blue-chip stock"" without delivering a cent of income, butAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL) fits the bill.You cannot argue its dominance in the search engine advertising game, and I simply don't think that's going to change. While the company is in a bit of hot water with advertisers overshowing their ads next to ""questionable"" content, that's a short-term problem that Google's engineers will be able to solve sooner rather than later.Meanwhile, GOOGL sits on more than $90 billion in cash and investments, and generated $25 billion in free cash flow last year.I do wish Alphabet would rely less on its life as a digital billboard and more on nurturing its venture capital investments. That's simply because I would prefer more diversification. But for now, the cash gives it plenty of flexibility and safety, and makes GOOGL a long-term hold from where I sit.Blue-Chip Stocks Every Investor Should Own: Cincinnati Financial (CINF)Source: ShutterstockI think every long-term diversified portfolio should have some sort of insurance holding in it.The entire concept of insurance would not work if, historically, claim payouts exceeded premiums. Yes, that's the reason the Affordable Care Act (aka Obamacare) is failing. But outside of health insurance, underwriting risk in virtually every situation has long been whittled down to a science.That's why I like insurance, and that's why I've chosen the famous Dividend Aristocrat,Cincinnati Financial Corporation(NASDAQ:CINF).CINF has been a very successful investment, and continues to generate plenty of cash flow for investors. It has a respectful dividend (2.8%), has returns on par with (or beating) theS&P 500, and should have clear sailing for some time to come.The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for the Next DecadeAnd who knows? Perhaps Obamacare will implode, and companies like Cincinnati Financial can add competitive health insurance products to its roster.Blue-Chip Stocks Every Investor Should Own: Disney (DIS)Source:Richard Stephenson via Flickr (Modified)Lastly, I want to recommendWalt Disney Co(NYSE:DIS).Yes, that Disney - the one that's struggling at the moment because ESPN is shedding subscribers at a brisk pace. In fact, next month, the divisionplans on axing more than 40 on-air personalitiesto help save on costs.Worse, ESPN hasn't been able to get out of its own way, insisting on alienating viewers bypermitting political commentary from its analysts. Sports is supposed to be free of this nonsense, and Iger needs to clamp down on this.Otherwise, DIS is kicking butt in everything else, especially with the purchase of Pixar Studios, Marvel Studios and LucasFilm over the past several years. This has set Disney up for generations of content based on multiple existing franchises - not just movies, but television, and of course the trickle-down effect into its theme parks and merchandise. This will carry Disney stock well into the next decade and possibly beyond.Disney is the premiere entertainment play in the stock market, and easily one of the top blue-chip stocks you should own.Lawrence Meyers is the CEO of PDL Capital, a specialty lender focusing on consumer finance. As of this writing, he owned DIS. He has 22 years' experience in the stock market, and has written more than 1,600 articles on investing. He also is the Manager of the forthcoming Liberty Portfolio.

Whole Foods Market, Inc. (WFM) Stock Takes Off on Albertsons Interest;4/24/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhole Foods Market, Inc.(NASDAQ:WFM) shares are surging higher on Monday on reports that grocery chainAlbertsonsis exploring a takeover bid. WFM stock is up roughly 3%, capping a 20%-plus rise out of its March low.makeArticleAd();Albertsons is owned by private-equity firmCerberus Capital Management, who reportedly held preliminary talks with bankers on an offer, according toFinancial Times.This comes just weeks after hedge fundJana Partners LLCsaid it had accumulated a 9% stake in WFM and was pressuring management to look at strategic options to boost shareholder value including changes to the board, revising contracts with suppliers, and potentially looking for a buyer.Bloombergreported earlier thismonth thatAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) considered making an offer last fall. The news outlet also reported that Albertsons was considering WFM rivalSprouts Farmers Market Inc(NASDAQ:SFM), but it appears nothing has come of that.The reversal higher in WFM stock marks the end of a three-year-long consolidation near the $30-a-share level that followed a 50% decline from the late 2013 high. The stumble was the result of slowing growth, public relations mishaps (asparagus waterandoranges in plastic), competitive pressures and a focus on its high prices.7 Short Squeeze Stocks That Will Be Shot Into OrbitIt's no small statement thatKroger Co(NYSE:KR) andWal-Mart Stores Inc(NYSE:WMT) are just as much a competitive threat - if not more - than smaller, more organic-focused chains such as Sprouts andTrader Joe's.Recent reports have indicated that Whole Foods management could soon take efforts to lower prices by centralizing itsdistribution chain, at the risk of eroding its focus on small, local brands. That begs the question: At what point does Whole Foods become even less attractive by abandoning the few things that still set it apart?Wall Street will get a revised picture of Whole Foods' progress May 10 after the bell, when the company reports its quarterly earnings.

Will Self-Driving Cars Power Apple (AAPL) to New Highs?;4/24/2017;"Reuters said thatAppleAAPLhas ""outlined"" a plan to ""train"" self-driving car operators, giving an insight into its closely guarded self driving car/technology efforts. Reuters cited documents released exclusively to it by California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV).For a while now, there has been tremendous speculation about Apple's autonomous car technology development efforts, which is apparently codenamed Project Titan. As usual, Apple has refrained from commenting on the matter so far as it loves to maintain secrecy regarding projects it's working on.Per latest report from Reuters, Apple's 41 page application submitted to DMV, CA, comprises a 10 page training plan that includes a document called ""Automated System: Development Platform Specific Training Overview."" The objective of Automated System: Development Platform Specific Training Overview is ""to train safety drivers in various automated driving conditions,"" Reuters further adds. However, these documents don't reveal a lot of things, like the kind of sensors attached to the vehicles or the self driving car platform mechanism.Last week, it was reported that Apple had secured a permit to test self-driving vehicles. The permit is issued to test drive three vehicles (2015 Lexus RX450h models) with two drivers each, added DMV.Apple's Project Titan has been in the news since 2014-2015. Initially, it was reported that Apple was working on an ""iCar."" There were numerous reports of the company making sound talent acquisitions as well as collaborating with the likes of BMW for the car design. VP of Product Design, Steve Zadesky was permitted to set up a 1K strong workforce for the project.Apple Inc. PriceApple Inc. Price|Apple Inc. QuoteLater on, the ""iCar"" rumors lost steam as the project was reportedly marred by conflicts and management troubles. Following this, Apple decided to prune some of its 1K strong workforce assigned to the project. In Jan 2016, with the resignation of Zadesky, things became more blurred. However, reportedly, Bob Mansfield was brought on board to once again spearhead the project in July 2016.It is now speculated that Apple may not be designing a full fledged car but an autonomous self driving car technology platform.Apple's fortunes remain tied to its flagship offering, iPhone, at least in the near term. With iPhone 7 and 7 Plus performing relatively well and the excitement building up for iPhone 8 (dubbed as a super cycle), Apple can breathe easy.However, increasing competition from cheaper handsets is emerging as a big concern. Apple is under great pressure to introduce new products. Apple Pay, Apple Watch, Apple Music are some of the new ventures undertaken by the company.Also, revenues from App Store are growing. Apple is also working on developing technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and augmented reality/ virtual reality (AR/VR), which are fast emerging as lucrative business opportunities. The company's interest in the autonomous car project is understandable as this is now being labeled as a big business opportunity.According to Boston Consulting Group estimates, the autonomous car market will be worth $42 billion by 2025 and $77 billion by 2035. Per Statista, the market for fully autonomous vehicles will grow to almost $6 billion while partially autonomous vehicles market will reach $36 billion by 2025.Self-driving technology gained immense importance in the past few years with tech and auto behemoths like AlphabetGOOGL, FordF, Tesla IncTSLA, Volkswagen AG, Daimler AG, Uber and Lyft directing resources to develop this technology.However, analysts are skeptical about self-driving cars being feasible before 2020, at least.Zacks Rank and Stock Price MovementCurrently, Apple has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Galaxy S8 Review: Samsung’s Back on Top;4/24/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSamsung Electronics(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) faced a make-or-break moment with the release of its new flagship smartphone, and our Galaxy S8 review puts the results to the test.makeArticleAd();Source: SamsungThe company's reputation was in tatters after the Galaxy Note 7's exploding batteries. Meanwhile,Alphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) was coming after it with the Google Pixel, a very competitive Android flagship smartphone. Arch rivalApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL), too, had surpassed Samsung's sales and taken the global sales crown with the iPhone 7, with a 10th anniversary iPhone 8 on the horizon.TheSamsung Galaxy S8is one of the biggest, most anticipated smartphone releases of 2017. The question is, does it live up to the hype?Galaxy S8 Review: Beating Apple to the PunchSamsung has traditionally launched its flagship Galaxy smartphones in the spring, while Apple waits until fall for new iPhone releases. This year, that order is going to have a very big impact.7 Healthcare Stocks With A-Rated ProspectsSamsung is springing an all-new, futuristic design on the smartphone world. The Galaxy S8 is virtually bezel-free. It's Amoled display stretches from side to side, and the Home button is banished to the back of the device, minimizing the top and bottom bezels.This lets Samsung squeeze a 5.8-inch Infinity display in the Galaxy S8. The Galaxy S8+ features a whopping 6.2-inch display in a form factor roughly the size of Apple's 5.5-inch iPhone 7 Plus.The Galaxy s8 also features a glass back design and ups the biometric security ante by adding an iris scanner.All of this puts Samsung in the position of raining on Apple's parade this fall. 2017 is the 10th anniversary of the iPhone and Apple is expected to make a big splash withan iPhone 8 with an all-new designfeaturing a near bezel-free Amoled display, glass back, iris scanner and no physical Home button. Sound familiar?While Apple is rumored to be plotting a$1,000-plus price tag for the iPhone 8, Samsung also took the risk of pricing the Galaxy S8 at a premium. At $749 (and $849 for the galaxy S8+), the Galaxy S8 costs $100 more than last year's Galaxy S7.Galaxy S8 Review: Two Flaws, But One Will Get Better With TimeThe Galaxy S8 is big -without feeling too large- speedy, and its display absolutely pops. The camera is the same as the Galaxy S7's and remains one of the best in the business. Unlike the iPhone 7, the Samsung Galaxy S8 retains a headphone jack and it doesn't just come with a pair of disposable buds, Samsung is offering $99 custom tuned pack-ins.But Samsung didn't get everything quite right.The fingerprint sensor is banished from the front. Unable to incorporate a scanner beneath the display, Samsung banished it to the back. But in an unfortunate design choice, the scanner is located right beside the camera lens. This has led to numerous complaints about smudgy photos.The second problem is Bixby, Samsung's new AI-powered virtual assistant. The Galaxy S8 comes with a dedicated Bixby button, but for the moment, voice functionality is disabled. That puts Bixby at a huge disadvantage compared to Siri or Google Assistant. However, in this case, the flaw will get better with time. Samsung is aiming to offer Bixby voice support later this spring.Galaxy S8 Review: Specifications5.8-inch quad-HD Super Amoled Infinity Display (5.8-inches on Galaxy S8+)Qualcomm Inc.(NASDAQ:QCOM) Snapdragon 835 CPU with 4GB RAM64GB storage (expandable to with microSD cards up to 256GB capacity)12 MP f/1.7 rear camera with Dual Pixel sensor and optical image stabilizationIris and fingerprint scanners3000mAh or 3500mAh battery with fast charging and support for wireless charging802.11ac Dual band MU-MIMO Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 5.0, USB-C, NFC, ANT+Includes Bixby personal assistant with dedicated Bixby buttonIP 68 water and dust resistantSamsung Pay supportRuns Android 7 Nougat0.31 or 0.32-inches thick, weighs 5.47 ounces or 6.10 ouncesMSRP $649 and $749Galaxy S8 Review: ConclusionWith the Samsung Galaxy S8 to deal with, Apple and Google have their work cut out when they release their own new flagship smartphones this fall.Samsung has beaten them to the punch with a new design statement that's expected to become the industry standard much the way the iPhone 6 inspired several years worth of aluminum-backed, rounded-corner clones. The 10th anniversary iPhone 8 in particular, appears to have lost some bragging rights.More importantly for Samsung, the Galaxy S8 gets a big monkey off its back. The new flagships shows that it can still build a beautiful, powerful smartphone. And the flood of positive Galaxy S8 reviews are a good sign that it's finally been able to put the Galaxy Note 7 fiasco in the rear view mirror.Snap Inc (SNAP) Stock Is Finally Falling ApartAt the moment, there's no real question about which smartphone is the best in the world. The next big question for Samsung is one we should know the answer for as launch sales numbers come in: are customers willing to pay a $100 premium over last year's Galaxy S7?As of this writing, Robert Martin did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceThe 10 Best Stocks to Buy for the Next Decade10 Stocks That Won't Exist in a Decade3 Downtrodden Stocks That You Need to Short NowThe postGalaxy S8 Review: Samsung's Back on Topappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Bank of America Corp (BAC) Stock Clears Key Hurdle on French Election;4/24/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBank of America Corp(NYSE:BAC) has mustered a 3.5% gain so far on Monday, and with just a quick look at the headlines, it'd be easy to doubt there will be any follow-through buying. While a fortuitous outcome in France's presidential election bodes relatively well for BAC stock - in that BofA has a respectable amount of exposure to the European market - at the end of the day, the party in power in Paris doesn't inherently bolster the bottom line.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockOn the other hand, sometimes a stock just needs the right nudge to reach the price it deserves to be trading it.Thanks to Monday's bump, BAC stock has cleared a key technical hurdle that clears the decks for more gains.The News Investors Cared AboutAs a refresher, Bank of America postedblowout first-quarter numbers. The company earned 41 cents per share on $22.2 billion in revenue, versus expectations for a profit of only 35 cents per share of BAC stock and sales of $21.6 billion. Even more impressive was the bottom line's year-over-year growth of 46%, and top-line growth of 12.5%.The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for the Next DecadeThe numbers were a strong affirmation that BofA is very much on the right track, having shrugged off the worst of bad loans to the energy sector. The subprime debacle (and fallout) is now only a fading memory.And yet, considering BAC stock had fallen 13% from its March high heading into earnings - suggesting traders weren't terribly optimistic - the post-earnings response from BofA shares felt lacking. The effort stalled just as soon as resistance was met at the stock's 20-day moving average, limiting the post-announcement gain to less than 4%.The phenomenon wasn't limited to Bank of America shares though.JPMorgan Chase & Co.(NYSE:JPM)crushed its earnings estimates as well, and the stock did nothing.DittoforCitigroup Inc(NYSE:C).For whatever reason, though, investors interpreted news from France's political scene as a big reason to buy U.S.-based banks, even as their solid earnings reports weren't a bullish prod. Broadly speaking, investors have been simply more concerned thatthe non-establishment candidate would mark the beginning of the end of the European Unionnow that the United Kingdom is out. Such a disruption poses a threat to all the big banks' business overseas.Now that threat has been at least partially abated.BAC Stock Shoots Above ResistanceWhile the response to the news from Bank of America is fundamentally a bullish one, the dramatic change for the better is a technical one: BofA's chart just cleared a key hurdle. That is, the 20-day moving average line (blue) that had been holding the stock back was cleared thanks to today's strength.It wasn't just a move above a key line in the sand, however, that makes this thrust such a high-potential one. There's also the bullish foundation it's built on.A closer look at the chart also indicates a slightly rising technical floor (orange, dashed) played a role in setting the stage for this turnaround.Click to EnlargeIt's not the ideal situation. Today's big move in BAC stock also left behind a bullish gap that could be filled in before all is said and done, upending the bullish move before it has a chance to get going in earnest. Still, as long as any gap-filling pullback doesn't drag shares back below the 20-day MA, currently at $23.12, the bulls will have the technical edge they need to keep the rally going.Bottom Line for Bank of AmericaThis is anything but a textbook reason to step into BofA now. Then again, the market has been anything but textbook for a long time now.Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Will Survive Earnings. It Always Does.If the masses think a continuation of France's political and economic policies are a good reason to own BAC stock, then it's a good reason to own it. The company's earnings growth just bolsters the argument.Just don't grip the stock so tightly you're unable to let go of it should the need arise. Although French centrist Emmanuel Macron appears to be the odds-on favorite - suggesting France will remain in the European Union - anti-establishment underdog Donald Trump wasn't expected to win either.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.The postBank of America Corp (BAC) Stock Clears Key Hurdle on French Electionappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Will Survive Earnings. It Always Does.;4/24/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhen you look at the big picture,Alphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL) has had a good year. The company grew both sales and earnings by more than 20% across calendar 2016, and GOOGL stock has risen accordingly - more than 15% in the past 12 months, and 11% year-to-date.makeArticleAd();Source:Travis Wise via FlickrIn fact, with Monday's push, shares are again trading at all-time highs.But there have been a few potholes along the way, and earnings misses were responsible for two of them - a pertinent fact as we head into Alphabet's Q1 earnings report, out Thursday after the bell.Earnings Misses Have Slowed Alphabet BeforeAlphabet has fallen shy of analyst earnings estimates in two of the past four quarters, including a 3% shortfall in Q4 2016. That miss prompted Google's parent to plummet from $857 to $815 in just four trading sessions across late January and early February.Last April, when the company missed first-quarter estimates by nearly 6%, GOOGL stock also fell hard, dropping nearly 10% in a week.The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for the Next DecadeOn both occasions, shares took a few weeks to recover from their earnings-induced losses. Those pullbacks, along with a couple other big declines around the Brexit and the presidential election, were enough to prevent GOOGL from keeping pace with otherNasdaqstocks. In fact, while Alphabet's 15% tally over the past 12 months sounds nice, it actually trails a 20% return in the broader composite.All of that is to say: Alphabet's earnings report this Thursdaydoesmatter, it's just not make-or-break.A miss could stunt shares' progress again and knock them off their perch at all-time highs. An earnings beat could send GOOGL stock even higher - likely to at least $900 before the calendar flips to May. Last July, for example, the stock jumped above $800 for the first time ever after the company beat earnings estimates by 4.7%.Alphabet is a rare bird. It's one of the largest companies in the world, and yet it still manages to routinely grow its top and bottom lines by double digits, putting it in a class with a select few, includingFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) andAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN).Sometimes, GOOGL is a victim of its own success, similar toApple(NASDAQ:AAPL) a few years ago. Alphabet has set the growth bar so high that analysts expect a lot from the company every quarter. When earnings (or sales) fall short of those expectations, investors punish the stock.But that's also why Alphabet is one of the most desirable stocks on the market.Those quick selloffs tend not to do any lasting damage. GOOGL stock has been on an upward trajectory for about five years, suffering no real comeuppance. Alphabet's difficulties might have slowed the stock down, but again … here we are, discussing the stock as it sits at all-time highs.A Low Bar Should Help GOOGL StockEstimates for this past quarter are more muted than usual. Analysts anticipate 19.5% sales growth with a small earnings decline, which would be the first since the third quarter of 2014. So the earnings bar is lower than usual for Alphabet this time around.Why Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Will Cool Down After Q1 EarningsA miss, combined with a rare profit decline, could spark a serious selloff - particularly with GOOGL stock at its lofty perch.My advice? If you already own - which I'm sure many of you do - simply hold on and weather whatever storm comes your way if the company misses earnings again on Thursday. Things will likely turn ugly, but if history is any indication, shares will recover their losses within a month.It's a bit more tricky if you're considering jumping in, but I suggest you wait for earnings and hope for a post-earnings dip in GOOGL stock before purchasing. Wall Street's typical overreaction to a miss could result in a prime buying opportunity in one of the market's great long-term growth stocks.Either way, Thursday's report looms large for Alphabet.As of this writing, Chris Fraley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceSnap Inc (SNAP) Stock Is Finally Falling Apart8 Retail Stocks That Can Win Despite Amazon7 Short Squeeze Stocks That Will Be Shot Into OrbitThe postAlphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Will Survive Earnings.

What Apple Inc. (AAPL) Self-Driving Car Technology Looks Like;4/24/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe rumors have been flying for several years thatApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) is secretly working on autonomous driving technology. We even had the code name for the effort: Project Titan. However, the cat was officially out of the bag two weeks ago when AAPL received a permit to test an autonomous car in California.makeArticleAd();Source: AppleNow, thanks to official training documents obtained byBusiness Insider, we know what Apple's self-driving car technology looks like.Why Apple Is Interested in Autonomous Car TechnologyThe closest Apple has ever come to releasing a product for automobiles is its CarPlay standard for integrating an iPhone into a car's entertainment system. So why the apparent fascination with futuristic auto technology like an autonomous car?The company has exploded in value and influence over the past decade because of the iPhone, but it's looking for the next big hit. With the successTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) has had, and the publicityAlphabet Inc's(NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google has reaped from it's self-driving car program, Apple clearly saw an opportunity. Over88 million cars and light duty trucks were sold in 2016and the revenue for automotive suppliers alone surpassed $670 billion in 2015.Even carving out a small slice of this market would be huge for AAPL stock holders.Fitbit Inc (FIT) Stock Is Going to Burn Amid Flex 2 Explosion ReportWe started to hear about Apple's Project Titan in 2015. At first, it was thought to be an electric car to compete with Tesla. Even Tesla'sElon Musk seemed convincedApple was preparing to directly take on his company. However, last fall there was an apparentshake-up in Project Titan. It was believed that Apple was pivoting from developing its own electric Apple car to instead developing an autonomous car software platform it could sell to automakers.Two weeks ago, Apple officially tipped its hand. The company received a permit to drive three Lexus vehicles equipped with autonomous car technology on California roads.Apple's Self-Driving Car Technology Outed by Training ManualBusiness Insidergot the scoop on what AAPL is up toby obtaining a copy of a training manual and official government documentation filed by the company.Called the Apple Automated System, AAPL's self-driving car platform uses a combination of hardware and software. Apple says its system is ""capable of sending electronic commands for steering, accelerating, and decelerating and may carry out portions of the dynamic driving task.""The documentation describes the testing Apple drivers must undergo on a private course before being allowed to take the Lexus autonomous car onto public roads. It also includes photographs of the cockpit of the cars and even details the modifications made to the vehicles.AAPL has equipped its test cars with a steering wheel and pedals made byLogitech(NASDAQ:LOGI) -the manufacturer of video game peripherals. The human ""driver"" can instantly take over control of the self-driving car by touching the brakes or grabbing the steering wheel.Where Does the Apple Automated System Go From Here?The end game for the Apple Automated System is clearly not to power an Apple car. At least not yet. Instead, AAPL will take aim at the traditional auto makers, hoping to convince them to license its system in their vehicles instead of spending the time and money to develop their own in-house technology.7 Tech Stocks That Are a Sneeze Away From CollapsingEven though it's now public knowledge, expect AAPL to remain tight-lipped on its autonomous car project. The Apple Lexus test vehicles will be spotted on California roads, but with so much at stake -Intel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) recently dropped $15 billion onMobileyetodevelop its own autonomous vehicle platform- Apple is likely to keep its cards close until it's ready for the big reveal.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceBeware of Apple Inc.

Why Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock Will Soar to $1,100;4/24/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsE-commerce retail giantAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) is scheduled to report first-quarter fiscal 2017 earnings results after the closing bell Thursday. With AMZN stock currently trading at near all-time highs, investors are betting that Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, who continues to push the envelop on what is possible at the intersection of retail and tech, can deliver another breathtaking quarter.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockAMZN stock closed Friday at $898.53, down 0.93%. As of this writing, the shares have risen 20.9% year-to-date, besting the 6% rise in theS&P 500 Index.And those who bought Amazon stock onmy recommendationon Sep. 29, when the shares closed at $829.05, have gained more than 11%. I issued anotherBuy recommendationon Jan. 18 that's yielded as much as 14%. All told, betting against Amazonand AMZN stock continues to be a foolish game.In that vein, I expect Amazon stock to reach $1,100 at some point in the next 12 to 18 months, yielding some 23% returns. And Amazon's first-quarter results will be a major catalyst to that target. For the three months that ended March, analysts expect the Seattle, Washington-based company to earn $1.13 per share on revenue of $35.31 billion, translating to year-over-year growth of 5.6% and 21.2%, respectively.For the full year, ending in December, earnings are projected to rise 47.7% YOY to $7.24 per share, while revenue of $165.26 billion would rise 21.5% YOY. Beyond the possible top- and bottom-line beat, however, AMZN stock will move based on the extent to which Amazon's profit margins rise. Critics often complain about the company's razor blade business model and aggressive spending, but Amazon's Q4 EPS beat of 19 cents and the 54% rise on the bottom line showed how Bezos can mash the profit accelerator whenever he wants.The performance of Amazon's dominant cloud services business AWS (Amazon Web Services) cloud service will also be closely watched Thursday. Analyst will want confirmation that AWS can fend off emerging threats from rival services ofMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) andAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGNASDAQ:GOOGL). In the fourth quarter, revenue from AWS surged 47% YOY to $3.54 billion.Rite Aid Corporation (RAD) Stock Is Much Worse Than You ThinkAWS showed enough growth momentum, suggesting higher profits in the quarters ahead. And with the company working on things like drones, long-haul freight deliveries, fleet of airplanes and a host of other growth endeavors, Amazon continues to operate with the mentality of a startup with many growth catalysts to send AMZN stock higher.Bottom Line for AMZN StockJeff Bezos hasn't always operated in the manner conventional wisdom would like, but his methods have gotten investors rich over the last five years as AMZN stock has soared 377% during that span. Accordingly, betting on Amazon stock is as much as placing on faith on Bezos' ability steer Amazon in the right direction. And until Bezos loses his Midas-like qualities, I'm punching my ticket for AMZN stock to reach $1,100 in the next 12 to 18 months, yielding some 23% returns.As of this writing, Richard Saintvilus did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 Dividend Stocks That Will Deliver Double-Digit Returns Every Year10 Stocks That Won't Exist in a Decade7 Top Emerging Markets Stocks to Buy NowThe postWhy Amazon.com, Inc.

3 Driverless Car Stocks You Won't Have to Babysit;4/24/2017;"Driverless cars are still in their infancy, but many   technology companies and automakers have shifted their efforts to   develop semi-autonomous systems into high gear as they wait   for the tech and the market to fully materialize. And well they   should -- by 2035, some analysts foresee the market for partially   and fully autonomous vehicles hitting $77 billion a year.We're still years away from fully autonomous vehicles, but a   handful of companies are making bigger strides toward them than   their rivals. Among those areAlphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google,NVIDIA(NASDAQ: NVDA) andTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) . Each is taking a different approach the   driverless car market, but all are solid plays that investors   don't need to babysit.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();AlphabetAlphabet's well-known efforts to develop driverless car   technologies began back in 2009, first as a project run by its   Google X R&D unit, and later spun off into their own   subsidiary, called Waymo.Through Waymo, Alphabet is working withFiat Chryslerto release 100 self-driving minivans later this year. Waymo CEO   John Krafcik said in press release last year that the   company wants to bring driverless car services to ride-sharing,   as well trucking, logistics, and consumer vehicles -- which   represents, essentially, nearly every facet of the automotive   market.Considering its just a small subsidiary, investors shouldn't   expect revenues from Waymo to move the needle at all for Alphabet   right now. But the parent company is very adept at figuring how   to monetize its businesses, and the fact that it was spun out   shows that management is confident that the unit could bring in   revenues of its own.With more than eight years of autonomous vehicle experience   under its belt already, and the $86 billion in cash Alphabet has   on hand to exploit whatever opportunities it finds, this   driverless car play is the epitome of a set-it-and-forget-it   stock.TeslaTesla has made some bold claims about its driverless-car plans   in the past. CEO Elon Musk said last year that by 2018, the   company's cars would be able to be summoned remotely by their   owners -- as in not driven by anyone -- from across the   country.It's looking highly unlikely that Tesla will havethatfeature live by next year, but the electric automaker's vehicles   are still far ahead of its competition. New Teslas already come   equipped with fully autonomous driving hardware, and ongoing   updates to the vehicles' software are slowly making more and more   self-driving features available to their owners.Investors should note that Tesla's valuation issky high right now, with a price-to-sales ratio of 7.1, compared to 0.29 for   competitors likeFord, and a forward P/E that sits above 150.There's likely to be some volatility ahead forTesla stockfor that reason, but that doesn't mean thatcurrentTesla shareholders will have to babysit their investment.   Tesla is ahead of other automakers in the semi-autonomous space,   and will likely continue to keep its lead for the foreseeable   future. But investors considering opening up a position in the   company should know that Tesla will likely have a hard time   growing at the rate it needs to justify its current   valuations.NVIDIAAnother solid bet on the driverless car market is graphics   processing unit (GPU) maker NVIDIA. The company has developed an   automotive AI computing platform called Drive PX 2, that can   rapidly process data from cameras and give semi-autonomous   vehicles situational awareness -- allowing them to ""understand""   and properly react to what they see around them.Already about 80 automakers and Tier 1 suppliers are using or   testing Drive PX, and Tesla is the latest company to partner with   NVIDIA for semi-autonomous driving systems. NVIDIA earned about   7% of its total revenue in its fiscal 2017 (which ended Jan. 29)   from its automotive segment, and sales from the business grew by   37% year over year in fiscal Q4 2017.Aside from that growth and its early lead in selling   semi-autonomous vehicle supercomputers to automakers, NVIDIA is   the leader in the GPU space, and earns most of its money (59% in   fiscal 2017) from sales in the gaming market. This will continue   to provide NVIDIA a lot of stability -- and resources -- as it   builds out its driverless car technologies. And it's a key reason   why investors won't have to keep a close eye on the company.To be clear, any investment comes with its own level of risk,   and investors shouldn't assume that Alphabet, Tesla, or NVIDIA   are now, or will remain, sure bets. But each company is poised to   dominate the driverless car market in their own way, which means   investors can rest a little easier with these companies in their   portfolios.10 stocks we like better than NvidiaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Semiconductor Stock Earnings Due on Apr 25: TXN, MTSI, CREE;4/24/2017;"The first-quarter earnings season is picking up pace, with results from 95 S&P 500 members or 24.9% of the index's total market capitalization already out (as of April 21).We expect almost 800 companies to report results this week, including 191 S&P 500 members.Per the latestEarnings Preview, total earnings of these index members are up 14.3% year over year on the back of 4.6% higher revenues. Beat ratios are impressive with 72.6% beating earnings estimates and 62.1% coming ahead of revenue expectations.Investors seem to be rejoicing as most of the companies have so far surpassed their estimates, particularly revenue estimates, in the first quarter. Also, growth has revved up from the preceding quarter and is on track to reach its highest level in almost three years. Continuation of these trends through the rest of this earnings season should serve as a reassuring development for the market.Total Q1 earnings are expected to rise 9.1% from the year-ago period on revenue growth of 6.0%. Five out of 16 Zacks sectors are expected to witness a decline in earnings in the first quarter, with Conglomerates, Autos and Transportation being the biggest drag.Technology will be in the spotlight this week, with several major companies including AlphabetGOOGLaka Google, Microsoft and Amazon, scheduled to report results this week.Here we take a look at three semiconductor companies that are set to report their quarterly earnings on Apr 25:Texas Instruments Inc.TXN,or TI, a global semiconductor company and one of the world's leading designers and suppliers of digital signal processors and analog integrated circuits, is slated to release its first-quarter 2017 earnings results.According to our model, a company needs the right combination of two key ingredients - a positiveEarnings ESPand a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) - to increase its odds of a positive earnings surprise.Consequently, we do not expect the company to post an earnings beat since it carries a Zacks Rank #2 and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with ourEarnings ESP Filter.Texas Instruments is benefiting from solid execution. Also, the company continues to prudently invest its R&D dollars in several high-margin, high-growth areas of the analog and embedded processing markets. This is gradually increasing its exposure to the industrial and automotive markets and increasing dollar content at customers, while reducing exposure to the volatile consumer/computing markets.We remain optimistic about TI's compelling product line, the differentiation in its business and lower-cost 300mm Analog output. (Read More:Texas Instruments Q1 Earnings: Is a Surprise in Store?)Notably, Texas Instruments' results surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the preceding four quarters. It has an average four-quarter positive surprise of 7.09%.Texas Instruments Incorporated Price and EPS     SurpriseTexas Instruments Incorporated Price and EPS   Surprise|Texas Instruments Incorporated QuoteWe also don't expectMACOM Technology Solutions Holdings Inc.MTSI, a provider of analog semiconductor solutions for use in wireless and wireline applications across the RF, microwave and milli meterwave spectrum, to post an earnings beat when it reports first-quarter 2017 results.This is because the company has a Zacks Rank #3 but an Earnings ESP of 0.0%. We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Strong Sell) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.The company's acquisition of Applied Micro Circuits Corporation will augment MACOM's reach in enterprise and cloud data centers and is likely to have a positive impact on its earnings in the to-be reported quarter. However, MACOM's continuing injunction with Infineon Technologies AG over designing, making, developing, selling or marketing Gallium Nitride on Silicon is likely to affect the upcoming results.Notably, MACOM's results surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two out of the preceding four quarters. It has an average four-quarter positive surprise of 4.05%.MACOM Technology Solutions Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS     SurpriseMACOM Technology Solutions Holdings, Inc.

The company is a manufacturer of semiconductors that enhance the value of solid-state lighting, power and communications products by significantly increasing their energy performance and efficiency. Cree remains focused on driving growth in its LED business.The company has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #3. You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank  stocks   here.Recently, Cree reached a license agreement with Ledvance, a leading manufacturer of innovative lighting products. The deal will help Cree to not only receive the ongoing royalty fees from Ledvance but will also gain the license to Ledvance's patent portfolio without having to pay any royalty fees to the latter. Moreover, the Cree owned Wolfspeed collaboration with Ford Motor Company (F) to develop modules could boost the efficiency of electric vehicles by up to 10%.While these developments augur well for the company, increasing competition in the LED space, an imbalance in demand and supply of manufactured products, and a sluggish global scenario could affect its results in the to-be-reported quarter.Notably, Cree's results surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two out of the preceding four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 12.05%.Cree, Inc.

Google vs. Ad Blockers: If You Can't Beat 'Em, Join 'Em;4/23/2017;"Google is the biggest internet-advertising company in the   world, so it's ironic that theAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) subsidiary is considering   including an ad blocking feature in its popular Chrome web   browser. Ad blocking has grown increasingly popular over the last   few years; roughly 26% of U.S. internet users now employ   ad-blocking software.Google may be looking to preempt further adoption of ad   blockers by automatically disabling the most annoying kinds of   ads on the web, like full-screen takeovers and autoplay video   ads. Google is backed by the Coalition for Better Ads, which   includes some of the largest marketers, ad agencies, and media   organizations, along withFacebook(NASDAQ: FB) .The rise of ad blocking is a threat to companies like Google   and Facebook that generate nearly all of their revenue from   online advertising. If they can control the ad-blocking software,   they can control which ads get blocked and which ones don't, a   win-win-win for internet users, publishers, and advertising   companies.makeArticleAd();Image source: Getty Images.Don't block every ad, just the bad onesGoogle has already built functions into its Chrome browser to   block ads that result in the biggest drains on laptop and   smartphone batteries. The updates it's discussing with publishers   and the Coalition will take another step, to block the ad formats   that overwhelmingly lead users to seek out ad blockers.Publishers are drawn to ads like full-screen takeovers and   autoplay videos because they typically fetch higher rates than   other ad units. However, they can also ruin the user experience,   potentially leading to high website abandonment rates. Top   publishers understand this and generally stay away from these   annoying formats, but with the proliferation of small publishers   through Facebook, it's more and more common to come across these   types of ads.The Coalition for Better Ads is in the process of setting   standards for publishers to follow. Google's Chrome browser is   just one vehicle through which it will enforce those standards.   Chrome is used by 58.6% of all web users; with that much of the   market, Google should be able to get most publishers to adopt the   standards, for fear they'll miss out on a lot of potential ad   revenue.Won't Google be hurting itself?Google is one of the biggest digital display advertisers in   the world, but most of its ad revenue actually comes from its   search business. Google doesn't break out search specifically,   but its owned and operated properties accounted for over 80% of   its total ad revenue last quarter. The other 20% came from its ad   network, which it splits with publishers.Google's own websites have increased their share of Google's   total ad revenue in recent years, as people spend more time   watching ads on YouTube and searching Google on their mobile   devices. While paid clicks on network member sites continue to   increase (despite the proliferation of ad blockers), Google's   revenue per click is declining.Facebook actually generates more revenue from display ads than   Google. But Facebook investors shouldn't be worried either.   Facebook's main ad unit -- native News Feed ads -- certainly   falls within the standards set forth by the coalition. Moreover,   most of Facebook's audience accesses its platform through a   dedicated mobile app, which is immune to ad-blocking services   like the one Google is reportedly developing.Even blocking the most annoying kinds of ads, Google can still   let nonintrusive ads through. That's better for both Google and   publishers than third-party software, which generally blocks any   and all ads. If Google integrates ad blocking into Chrome, it   could stop many consumers from going for those third-party apps,   saving some revenue for Google and its network partners.10 stocks we like better than Alphabet (C     shares)When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Alphabet and Apple: 2 of the Best Healthcare Stocks on the Market?;4/22/2017;"Every company is a healthcare company now. At least, that's   what it seems like sometimes.BothApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) and Google parentAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL)  are working on technology to   help manage diabetes and address other healthcare issues. Could   Alphabet and Apple now be considered two of the best healthcare   stocks around? Maybe so.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();Teaming upAlphabet has a couple of companies focusing on healthcare --   Calico and Verily. And these companies have forged partnerships   with some big established healthcare companies along the way.Calico was formed in 2013 to develop technologies that   increase the human lifespan. The following year,AbbVieteamed up with Calico, investing $750 million to try to bring new   therapies to market for patients with age-related diseases,   including neurodegeneration and cancer.In late 2015, Google Life Sciences changed its name to Verily   Life Sciences. Verily is working withDexcom(NASDAQ: DXCM) to develop miniaturized continuous glucose   monitors for type 2 diabetic patients. It formed a joint venture   withGlaxoSmithKlineto create bioelectronic medicines that use tiny implanted devices   to treat disease. The Alphabet business unit also   formed other joint ventures withJohnson & Johnsonto develop robotic surgical systems and withSanofito create technology that helps diabetic patients better manage   their health.Perhaps the most intriguing project that Verily is working on   is its effort withNovartisto develop a smart contact lens that senses glucose level in   tears. The goal is to have contact lenses that change color if   diabetic patients' glucose levels aren't where they need to   be.No pain, big gainCNBCrecently reportedthat Apple has a secret initiative underway that's trying a   different approach in monitoring glucose levels. Currently,   patients must use finger sticks that pierce their skin four times   per day to monitor their glucose levels. Apple's team is trying   to develop a solution that uses optical sensors instead.The ultimate goal is to fulfill Apple founder Steve Jobs'   vision of wearable devices that could continually monitor   important vital signs. Apple Watch already enables monitoring of   heart rates. Apple has applied for a patent to send alerts to   family or emergency staff if an Apple Watch wearer has heart   problems, such as arrhythmia. However, monitoring glucose in a   completely non-invasive way has been impossible so far.Dexcom does have a continuous glucose monitoring system that   interfaces with Apple Watch. However, the system uses a sensor   that is placed underneath the skin. It also requires a minimum of   two finger sticks each day for calibration. Apple's hope appears   to be to eliminate the need for finger sticks entirely.Apple is looking at other healthcare opportunities as well.Bloombergreported last yearthat the company intends to transform its HealthKit app that runs   on iPhones and Apple Watches from a primarily fitness application   to a tool that helps improve diagnoses. Apple also bought a small   company in early 2016, Gliimpse, which is developing software   that stores electronic health records from multiple sources in   one place.Top healthcare picks?There's no question that both Alphabet and Apple are trying to   solve some of the most challenging problems in healthcare. But   are the stocks good choices for investors wanting to profit from   the growth in the healthcare industry? Yes and no.The negative response isn't because Alphabet and Apple aren't   solid stock picks. They are. However, in the near term, neither   company will generate enough revenue from healthcare to rank the   stocks among the best ways to ride the healthcare wave.On the other hand, investors should look at the long run. If   Alphabet and Apple are successful in achieving their goals, the   financial opportunities in healthcare for both companies are   enormous. The diabetes testing market could reach $17 billion by   2021. If Alphabet's smart contact lens pans out and Apple's   optical sensor technology works, the two technology giants could   also become healthcare giants.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Google Wallet is Making Strides, But it's No Venmo Killer;4/22/2017;"Last month,Alphabet Inc(NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG)announcedGmail users would now be able to send and receive money on   Android devices through its Google Wallet platform. The service   had been available through Gmail since 2013 but, until last   month, was unavailable on mobile devices.To use the service, all that is needed is to compose a new   email in the Gmail app on any Android mobile device. Once a new   email is opened, users simply choose the ""Send money"" or ""Request   money"" options under he attachment icon. After a debit card is   linked and the amount of money is selected, the funds can then be   sent to anyone with an email address or phone number. The   recipient does not need to be an existing Google Wallet user or   have a Gmail account and is free to all users. The service is   currently only available in the United States and United   Kingdom.Image source: Pixabay.makeArticleAd();The feature is the latest attempt by Alphabet to engage its   over one billion active Gmail users. The Android operating   system, which runs on most smartphones and tablets, had 1.4   billion active users as of September 2015. The overlap between   the two is almost certain to be in the hundreds of millions,   making this new feature an avenue Alphabet could pursue to deepen   its relationships with its huge account holder base.Google Wallet's uninspiring pastWhile Alphabet has never released official figures on how many   active users exist on Google Wallet, it doesn't take too much   digging to discover it is not widely used; a situation almost   assuredly of Alphabet's own making. From the beginning, the   platform has struggled from a lack of attention and strategy from   its parent company. As a prime example of this neglect, this very   feature of using Gmail to send money to other people was first   available to desktop users in 2013. Yet it took four additional   years for Google to incorporate it into Gmail's app on mobile   devices.Image source: Alphabet Inc'sGoogle blog.Originally, NFC (near field communication) technology was to   be used in conjunction with Google Wallet so that the app could   be used to make point-of-sale (POS) purchases. However, this   capability was dropped in September 2015. In 2016, Google   discontinued the Google Wallet card, a physical debit card linked   directly to one's Google Wallet account. These decisions   effectively ended any way customers could use their Google Wallet   accounts to make POS transactions at physical retail locations,   though there are some work-arounds, such as linking a Google   Wallet account to Android Pay, a separate payment app available   only to Android users.Google Wallet's uneven presentThe constant meddling with Google Wallet's capabilities has   certainly contributed to its lagging popularity. It is now   essentially a P2P payment platform left to compete with the likes   ofPayPal Holdings Inc's(NASDAQ: PYPL) Venmo and the newly launched Zelle, a P2P app   provided by many of the nation's largest banks to their   customers.Google Wallet will have to overcome many obstacles if it is to   capture significant market share. InAccenture's2016 North America Consumer Digital Payments   Survey, consumers indicated they trusted traditional card providers,   alternative payment providers (e.g. PayPal), and established   retail banks as potential mobile payment providers over larger   tech companies.And the competition isn't standing still. In 2016's fourth   quarter, PayPal's Venmo app, ahit with millennials, facilitated $5.6 billion in payment volume, an eye-popping 126%   increase year over year! In December 2016, Venmo crossed the $2   billion total payment volume mark in a single month for the first   time in its history. It was just earlier in the year when it   first passed the $1 billion threshold in a single month!Zelle is a P2P payment service operated by Early Warning which   is owned by some of the country's largest financial institutions   includingBank of America,BB&T,Capital One,JP Morgan Chase,PNC Financial, andWells Fargo. As with Google Wallet's new service, these banks' account   holders will be able to send and receive funds using nothing more   than a person's email address or phone number. Many of Zelle's   future users will be able to access the service through their   existing mobile banking apps, meaning no additional apps will   need to be downloaded onto their smartphones.Google Wallet's uncertain futureWill this latest feature spark renewed interest and user   engagement in Google Wallet? While it is impossible to tell, I   believe it is highly unlikely, although I certainly see some uses   for it. Earlier this spring, I was exchanging emails with my   sister about an upcoming summer vacation our families were taking   together. She mentioned she would book a large cabin in the   mountains and I could pay her back later. It would have been nice   to simply respond via email with the accompanying payment   attached.While I know it would not have taken much effort to sign up   for the service, it still would have taken more effort than using   PayPal, a service my sister and I both regularly use. And, while   it is possible to send money through Gmail to people who are not   yet users of the service or who do not have a Gmail address, I   did not want to put my sister through the aggravation of having   to link her debit card to the email to retrieve the money.The uphill battle Google Wallet faces is one many platforms   are familiar with -- once users are comfortable using a certain   system, it's tough to get them to switch.PayPal's core platform currently has 200 million active   accounts and is consistently growing by double-digit percentages   each year. As noted above, Venmo is currently growing by   triple-digit percentages year over year. Given the gigantic lead   these two PayPal platforms enjoy, it's hard to see Google Wallet   closing the gap without a huge marketing push and lots of   accompanying attention from its parent company. With Alphabet's   track record with Google Wallet, that's not something to count   on.10 stocks we like better than Alphabet (A     shares)When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Twitter Wants to Litter Your Timeline With Video Ads;4/21/2017;"There's no questionTwitter(NYSE:TWTR) is making a big bet on video. From integrating live Periscope   streams with its flagship app to paying for premium content,   Twitter is pushing more and more video into users' timelines. But   likeFacebook(NASDAQ: FB) , Twitter is still looking for ways to maximize the   value of those videos.It has stand-alone video ads that show up between organic   posts. It's also allowed marketers to buy pre-roll ads, which   play ahead of videos produced by top content creators. That's   something Facebook has long resisted. Instead, Facebook decided   to test mid-roll video ads, and now Twitter is copying that idea   for its videos.Twitter has been de-emphasizing its non-video ad formats, so   the push for more video ads is integral to its future ability to   grow. The new mid-roll ad format could increase Twitter's ad   inventory at a time when marketers are looking for new places for   their digital video ads.makeArticleAd();Image source: Twitter.Big competition in videoOnline video continues to explode, and Twitter has some big   competitors vying for people's attention. The champion of viral   videos and time sucks is YouTube, the subsidiary of Google, anAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) company. Meanwhile, Facebook has   continued to push more videos into users' News Feeds, and it even   launched a dedicated section in its app just for users to watch   more videos.Snap's Snapchat has built a nice video-advertising business on   top of 10-second disappearing messages. Smaller competitors (some   backed by large companies) are popping up every day.Twitter says video impressions ""grew significantly from Q3 to   Q4 2016,"" but declined to give any specifics. That's not too   surprising, though, considering both Facebook and YouTube have   also shied away from giving specific numbers recently.But given the amount of emphasis Twitter is putting on video,   it needs to start giving investors some idea of how much users   are engaging with video, at least on a relative basis. Without   those details, it's impossible to tell if Twitter is gaining   share in the digital video market -- which is growing rapidly,   but also becoming extremely crowded.The market is getting big fast, but it's dominated by two   playersFrom 2014 to 2016, U.S. digital video advertising grew from   49% of total digital-ad spend to 57%, according to the   Interactive Advertising Bureau. The average advertiser expected   to spend 85% more on video ads in 2016 than in 2014. eMarketer   expects U.S. digital video advertising to grow at a double-digit   rate through 2020, reaching $16.7 billion.That growth, however, is largely fueled by just Facebook and   YouTube. A whopping 72% of marketers intend to increase spending   on YouTube, according to a survey published by eMarketer.   Facebook was the second most popular choice, with 46% of   marketers intending to increase video ad spending on the   platform. Twitter garnered the favor of just 25% of   marketers.Those numbers may have changed following controversy over ads   playing before offensive content on YouTube. Several big brands   have boycotted Google, opening the door for smaller players like   Facebook or Twitter. But YouTube remains one of the most popular   places to watch online videos and Google is taking steps to curb   the ability to monetize offensive content, which means it should   continue to attract tons of interest from marketers.Does Twitter need more video ad inventory?Twitter is looking to increase video ads, but it might be   looking at it from the wrong side of the equation. Offering a   bigger supply without a bigger demand won't do much to move the   needle. In fact, Twitter is taking a risk of turning users away   from watching videos if they dislike watching ads in the middle.   That's why Facebook has been very slow to roll out the new ad   format itself.Twitter, understandably, wants to give marketers as many   options as possible, and mid-roll ads do have the potential to be   more effective and valuable than pre-roll or stand-alone ads.   Users are paying attention already, the sound is probably on, and   the video is likely fully in view. But it's unlikely to have a   meaningful impact on revenue without Twitter working to increase   the attractiveness of its platform.That means it needs to start showing marketers real numbers   with regard to video engagement on its platform. Twitter has   provided lots of positive numbers showing how its video ads   improve recall, brand awareness, and purchase intent among   viewers who see them, but it's not providing the bigger picture:   how many people actually see Twitter video ads. Without that data   showing improvements in video engagement, Twitter will continue   to fall out of favor with marketers.10 stocks we like better than TwitterWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

3 Charts That Show Why Amazon is Amazing;4/21/2017;"Longtime Fool readers are no doubt familiar withAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) . The company revolutionized the book distribution   business, then most of retail, then logistics, then corporate   infrastructure with its cloud business; it is currently setting   its sights on India, TV and film, drones, artificial   intelligence, and just about everything else under the sun.Since the company is in so many industries and has a   high-profile CEO who now owns anewspaperand arocket business, it can be easy to get caught up in the daily headlines. Still,   with the company at all-time highs, current and prospective   investors may want to step back and appreciate the big picture.   Here are a few charts that show why Amazon is amazing.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();""Your margin is my opportunity""The following chart looks unlike any other company I've come   across, except forNetflix. That should terrify any retailer, especially those who have   traditionally, you know, delivered profits, buybacks, and   dividends to investors. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos once said, ""Your   margin is my opportunity,"" and he wasn't kidding:AMZN Revenue (Annual)data byYCharts.As you can see, Amazon has never indulged shareholders with   GAAP profits. Therefore, it never has to take them away. This   freedom from margins means that Amazon can go into just about any   business it wants and disrupt it from below. Given that the   company is branching out into basically anything related to   retail or technology, it's a wide-open space Amazon can explore,   equipped with the fastest horse.It's killing the mall (or, them all)The next chart shows Amazon taking sales from mall-based and   other power-center retailers (Wal-Martis left off since its $450 billion sales would skew the chart).   As you can see, competitors' lines are relatively flat:AMZN Revenue (Annual)data byYCharts.Meanwhile, Amazon seems to be soaking up the extra sales, as   the undisputed leader in e-commerce. While other stores are also   investing in omnichannel and boosting their own online   strategies, they're all playing catch-up.Now Amazon is contemplating opening brick-and-mortar stores,   taking on legacy retailers on their home turf: the in-store   experience. Given Amazon's rabid focus on customer satisfaction,   you can bet there will be something interesting about the Amazon   bookstore coming to a town near you.It's dominating the cloud despite competitionAmazon now has a cash cow, and it's scary: AWS (Amazon Web   Services) is a small business relative to the retail segment, but   it is growing like wildfire and earns 26% operating margins. In   the most recent quarter, AWS grew a whopping 47% and now sports a   $14 billion run rate:Data: Synergy Research. Chart by Author.As the chart above shows, AWS is the dominant first-mover in   the industry. And while the secret is out that cloud computing is   the future, competitors have not made a dent. The industry seems   to be coalescing around AWS and services fromMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) ,Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) , andIBM(NYSE: IBM) .While those companies are growing market share, it has not   come at the expense of AWS, but rather, from smaller upstarts.   This is because, as theWall Street Journalreportedlast weekend, building a cloud infrastructure costs huge amounts   of money, and only the top dogs can compete. Amazon, Microsoft,   and Alphabet spent a whopping $31.5 billion in capital   expenditures in 2016. That's impossible to compete with if you're   not already one of the largest companies.This is leading to what is known as an oligopoly with a strong   secular tailwind -- a profitable combination indeed. According toGartner, the IaaS (infrastructure as a service) industry is set to grow   37% this year, and will continue torrid growth for the   foreseeable future. If AWS can just maintain its share, Amazon   looks like it will have even more cash to deploy into new markets   and opportunities.Bottom line: Amazon's unique record of reinvestment and   experimentation is a formidable advantage, and it is not slowing   down.10 stocks we like better than AmazonWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Why India ETFs are Soaring in 2017;4/21/2017;"Emerging market ETFs are surging in 2017 and within that space, India ETFs are the best performers. Foreign investors continue to pour money into Indian stocks as optimism about economic growth and structural reforms continues to rise.Since his election in 2014, Prime Minister Modi's government has pushed through a lot of reforms in India. Foreign investors continue to believe that he will be able to take necessary actions to promote foreign investments, revamp tax system, promote infrastructure and reduce corruption.Modi's party recently had a big victory in an important state election, which suggests that he'll most likely win second term in office in the next general elections.Per IMF, the Indian economy will grow at 7.2% in 2017 and 7.7% in 2018, making it the fastest growing major economy in the world.For US tech giants, India is a very important market and they're betting big on growth prospects in the country.Apple (AAPL)is expected to start manufacturing iPhones in India within the next 1-2 months. It is an important market for them since sales in China are slowing down. India is now the second largest smartphone market in the world.Amazon (AMZN)is investing $5 billion in India.Facebook (FB)and Google-Alphabet (GOOGL)compete with each other to provide connectivity to Indians that have no internet access as of now.With a population exceeding 1.2 billion, India has the potential to become the largest open internet market in the world.Uber isaggressively expandingin India, after retreating from China last year.To learn more about three popular India ETFs-theiShares MSCI India ETF (INDA),WisdomTree India Earnings Fund (EPI)and the Van Eck India Small-Cap Index ETF (SCIF), please watch the short video above.More Stock News: 8 Companies Verge on Apple-Like   RunDid you miss Apple's 9X stock explosion after they launched their iPhone in 2007?

IMF Ups Global Growth Forecast: 3 ETFs to Buy;4/21/2017;"Global economic activity seems to be picking up as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimates 3.5% growth in 2017 and 3.6% in 2018 compared with 3.1% growth in 2016.  The fund raised its forecasts from the estimates released in October 2016 with easing global macro tensions and rising investment levels worldwide.Booming financial markets and a recovery in trade seem to be driving the optimism. The IMF stated that one of the reasons for the improved outlook was the increase in U.S. consumer confidence, which hit a 16-year high. Further, better manufacturing results in Europe and Japan also contributed to the same. Eurozone Manufacturing PMI rose to 56.2 in March 2017, up from 55.4 in February. Moreover, Japan's exports rose 12% year-over-year while its trade surplus rose to $5.64 billion (614.7 billion yen) (read:Join Eurozone Rally with These ETFs).makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');Emerging markets and developing economies have performed quite well in the recent years, accounting for more than three-fourths of global growth lately, as per IMF. The higher income gap in these nations indicates potential for growth (read:Can Emerging Market ETFs Retain Their Mojo in 2017?).Risks InvolvedSpecific downside risks as a result of growing protectionism in the world, trade barriers, rapid credit growth in China due to the credit stimulus by the government and the rise of populism in global politics are concerns, as per IMF.Moreover, the IMF further warned that a faster path to rate hikes by the Federal Reserve may cause emerging economies to decline. IMF also anticipates that the proposed banking deregulation in the U.S. may result in a financial crisis (read:4 Hedge Fund ETFs to Counter Geopolitics & Fed Fears).Considering the current scenario, let us discuss the following ETFs.Vanguard Total World Stock ETFVTThis fund is one of the broadest options available in the equity market, offering a global diversified exposure to investors at a relatively cheaper expense ratio.It has AUM of $10.4 billion and charges a paltry 11 basis points in fees per year.

Amazon is now offering these technologies as a fully managed service.Building Voice and Text-based Apps is Now EasyWith Amazon Lex, developers can build conversational apps easily, which were otherwise extremely difficult to create as these involved complicated deep learning algorithms on enormous amount of data.Moreover, the integration of Amazon Lex with AWS Lambda (Amazon's event-driven, serverless computing platform) will enable developers to run serverless codes, apply business logic and fetch data from enterprise applications and AWS services like Amazon DynamoDB.Further, inbuilt connectors enable the conversational apps to collect data from Software as a Service (SaaS) applications such as Salesforce, QuickBooks, Zendesk and Marketo.Developers can also use analytics provided by Amazon Lex to assess different application performance and accuracy metrics that they can employ to better their apps over time.We note that Amazon's shares appreciated 42.9% in the last one year compared with the Zacks Internet Commerce industry's gain of 37.6%. AWS' growth is expected to back the momentum going ahead.Banking on Alexa's SuccessAmazon Alexa is powered by Amazon Lex's sophisticated deep learning algorithms. Alexa powered Echo devices are going great guns and help the company sell products and services. Alexa has already been integrated into a host of everyday devices for the digital home and there are agreements for more.Amazon is racing to build an ecosystem around Alexa and it's safe to say that it's taken an early lead over AlphabetGOOGLowned Google's smart assistant and Microsoft'sMSFTCortana.Driven by its Alexa-powered Echo devices, the company has converted the nascent smart home market into a potential area of growth in a very short time.So, it appears that by bringing the artificial intelligence (AI) platform that powers Alexa to AWS customers, Amazon is trying to bank on Alexa's success to boost AWS.Amazon.com, Inc. Net Income (TTM)Amazon.com, Inc. Net Income (TTM)|Amazon.com, Inc. QuoteAWS Under the SpotlightThe move underscores the fact that Amazon continues to beef up AWS and why not? The unit that was started for the purpose of handling the company's own storage needs has quickly become a billion-dollar business and the cash cow for Amazon. The business generates much higher margins than retail, so it has a positive impact on Amazon's profitability.We believe that the move will boost functionality, partner ecosystem and the experience AWS offers and leads to continued customer wins. AWS has already taken a lead over rival services, such as Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform and International Business Machines'IBMIBM Cloud.If AWS continues to witness the same kind of success, investors can hope for far more growth.Currently, Amazon has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

3 Stocks to Hold for the Next 50 Years;4/21/2017;"Stocks to hold for 50 years? At first, that seems like an   impossible request. We've all seen it in recent years: Even huge,   great companies fade, get disrupted, or run aground on scandals   or disasters of various kinds.But sometimes, you can tell that a company isn't just great   now, it's built to be great for decades to come. With the caveat   that nothing in the future is certain, our Foolish contributors   thinkAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) ,Amazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) , andEaton Corporation(NYSE: ETN) are good choices to add to a truly long-term   portfolio.Alphabet's self-driving car company, Waymo, is just one of     its many moon shots. Image source: Fiat Chrysler     Automobiles.makeArticleAd();Possibly the world's greatest innovation engineKeith Speights(Alphabet):If you didn't use Alphabet's Google nearly every day this week,   you're probably one of the few in the developed world who didn't.   Alphabet is best known for its Google search engine, Chrome   browser, YouTube video site, and Android mobile operating system,   which powers nearly 9 out of 10 smartphones.Why buy and hold Alphabet for the next 50 years? The company   simply doesn't stop innovating. Innovation doesn't just   apply to Alphabet's moon shot efforts. The company continues to   improve its existing products, sometimes in ways that you don't   even notice. (Those can be the best kinds of innovations,   actually.)However, I admit to being intrigued by the moonshot programs.   Alphabet's ""other bets"" business segment includes Calico, Nest,   Verily, Waymo, and X. Two of these initiatives are in the   healthcare arena. Calico is focused on increasing the human   lifespan, while Verily works on technology like developing   glucose-sensing contact lenses for diabetic patients. Nest is   developing home automation technology. Waymo is a pioneer in   self-driving cars. And X focuses on a variety of   projects including using a network of balloons to bring   internet access to the two-thirds of the world's population that   doesn't have it yet.While Alphabet pursues these incredibly cool ideas, its core   businesses are generating revenue of more than $90 billion and   earnings of $19.5 billion annually. Many of the company's moon   shots won't pan out. But I suspect that some will. I also think   that 50 years from now, Alphabet will still be innovating -- and   still making investors a lot of money.""E-commerce king"" is just the beginningJohn Rosevear(Amazon.com):Amazon hardly needs an introduction, but it always surprises me   to find that many tech-savvy investors don't own any shares of   the online-retail-and-more colossus.If you're one of those investors, it's time to reconsider.   Yes, Amazon is already huge. Yes, its stock price is high. But it   still has immense growth potential, and it genuinely has the   cash-generation ability and management team to fully pursue that   potential.Between Amazon's Alexa voice-recognition software (and the   powerful artificial intelligence capabilities that underlie it),   its Amazon Web Services cloud-computing empire, its incredibly   dominant online-retail business, and the dozens of small bets   that CEO Jeff Bezos seems to add every quarter... the upside here   probably isn't limitless, but it's big. Twenty-plus years in,   it's still seems like Amazon is just getting started.And while other companies will come and go, Amazon isn't going   anywhere. It's got plenty of cash, management that is heavily   invested, and good wide moats around its core businesses --   together, a recipe for profitable growth for decades to come. I   own Amazon shares, and I suspect my sons will inherit them   -- hopefully, many years from now.Always adjusting to the timesReuben Gregg Brewer(Eaton):Global industrial giant Eaton Corp.'s sales have fallen in each   of the last two years, buffeted by slow economic growth and   currency volatility. However, the company managed to increase its   operating margin in both years because of aggressive   restructuring efforts. The bottom line, meanwhile, has held up   relatively well (Eaton made $4.21 a share in 2016, down just   $0.02 from 2015), and the dividend has been increased every year   for the past seven years.Eaton's focus is on power management, which it covers through   its electrical products, electrical systems and services,   hydraulics, automotive, and aerospace segments. It has a long   history of buying and selling businesses to adjust its portfolio   over time. Its biggest recent deal was the 2012 acquisition of   Cooper Industries, a $12 billion transaction that materially   expanded its electrical operations. Tweaking businesses to get   the most out of them, as highlighted above, is another ongoing   focus.Essentially, Eaton is a pro at shifting with the changing   times via acquisition and internal tweaks. In fact, it started   its life over 100 years ago as an axle manufacturer, eventually   selling that division in 1998 to focus on more lucrative   operations. It's unlikely that you will ever find Eaton an   exciting stock to own, but you can rest assured that it will   deftly navigate the ups and downs of the business cycle over the   next 50 years, transforming itself with the market as it goes.   Meanwhile, you'll be rewarded with a nice 3.2% dividend yield   that has a long history of increases behind it.10 stocks we like better than AlphabetWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Should You Buy Google Stock?;4/20/2017;"Google (Shutterstock photo)Alphabet, Inc. (GOOG,GOOGL) is the most valuable brand and the second largest company in the U.S. in terms of market capitalization. Founded by Larry Page and Sergey Brin in September 1998, the company is best known for products and platforms, such as Gmail, Android, Chrome, YouTube, Maps, Ads and Search. As Alphabet gears up toannounceits Q1 FY2017 earnings on Thursday, April 27, after market close, here’s a look at what makes Alphabet a sound stock.Robust NumbersmakeArticleAd();During the past five-year period, Alphabet has reported a consistent rise in revenue, net income and earnings per share. During FY2016, it clocked a revenue worth $90.27 billion, growing at 20.38% vis-à-vis FY2015 while its net income neared the $20 billion mark, increasing by 19.14%.While Alphabet operates its business in multiple operating segments, all its major products and services (advertising, digital content, apps, cloud offerings and hardware products) and even newer efforts like Virtual Reality, fall under Google, which commands around 90% of its total revenue. Nevertheless, Other Bets (Internet and TV services, licensing and R&D services and nest branded hardware), which makes up a rather small segment, is growing at a fast pace, advancing 82% in FY2016.Product PopularityGoogle is indisputably the most popular search engine in the world. It leads the global desktop search engine market share with 79.54%, followed distantly by Baidu, Bing and Yahoo! at 7.12%, 6.49% and 5.50% respectively, according toNetMarketShare(January – March 2017). Itsmarket sharereaches almost 96% for search on mobile and tablets.In the operating system (OS) space for smartphones, Google’s Android captured 84.8% of the market share during 2016 (an increase of 3.2%), as per a Gartnerreport. Today, Google can boast of a wide portfolio of popular products and services. While YouTube has over abillion users(almost one-third of all people on the Internet), Gmail, Chrome and Maps are among the most widely used services in their respective segments.Revenue SourcesAbout 88% of Alphabet’s overall revenue comes via Google’s advertisement platforms. Recognizing the concentration of its revenue stream, the company is not just keen on retaining a grasp on the digital advertising world but is also building potential revenue streams.In November 2015, Urs Hölzle, Senior Vice President for Technical Infrastructure at Googlesaid, “My goal is for us to talk about Google as a cloud company in 2020 because our revenue is bigger than the ads revenue and it’s a realistic possibility.” Cloud is a rapidly growingsegmentfor Google andit’s accordingly investing into it.During Q4 FY2016, Google was among the fastest growing cloud providers, featuring among the top four and constituting 23% of the market share along with Microsoft and IBM, as per a Synergyreport. Gartnerprojectsthe worldwide public cloud services market to reach $246.8 billion in 2017.On the advertising front, according to a recentreportby eMarketer, the U.S. digital ad spending will reach $83 billion in 2017 and Google will maintain its dominance, accounting for 40.7% of the total U.S. digital ad revenues. The report further projects Google to claim roughly 78% of the total U.S. search ad revenues.R&D and AcquisitionsGoogle has committed a significant sum on research and development (R&D) and acquisitions year after year to enhance the ‘breadth and depth’ of its offerings while making value-adds to its existing products.The company spent $13.95 billion on R&D in FY2016, higher than $9.83 billion and $12.28 billion in FY2014 and FY2015, respectively. Out of the total employee strength of 72,000 at the end of December 2016, almost 38% were absorbed in R&D.Google has made more than 200 acquisitions since 2001 with 35 in 2014, 16 in 2015 and 17 in 2016. It has already acquired five firms in 2017 so far in areas of cloud and analytics. Today, Google is actively working to sharpen its skill set in advanced technologies, such as artificial intelligence, machine learning and virtual reality, which not just drive innovation but offer smarter and useful products.Google is a firm believer in ‘moonshots,’ as it states, “...our founders also explained that you could expect us to make smaller bets in areas that might seem very speculative or even strange when compared to our current businesses.”Final WordAlphabet has deep roots with a strong consumer base for its core offerings. With more and more people joining the Internet bandwagon, its reach and subscriptions are bound to increase. Furthermore, with fresh monetization initiatives and efforts to expand strongly into non-search, high potential areas such as cloud computing and Google Play, Alphabet’s revenue basket should not just grow but gain better balance in the years ahead.The author has no position in any stocks mentioned. Investors should consider the above information not as a de facto recommendation, but as an idea for further consideration."

PayPal Holdings Inc (PYPL) Hopes Partnership Will Make It the King of Mobile Payments;4/20/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsEarlier this week, it was announced thatPayPal Holdings Inc(NASDAQ:PYPL) and Google parent companyAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) will be partnering up to integrate PayPal's mobile payment options into Google's NFC-enabled smartphone payment app, Android Pay.makeArticleAd();Source:Via PayPalNo specific details of the arrangements were revealed, but according toFortune, ""PayPal's chief operating officer, Bill Ready, said that his company's partnership with Googlewill be implemented in the coming weeks.""Executives at both GOOGL and PYPL hope that the addition of PayPal as a funding source for Android Pay will serve to increase the number of smartphone owners who actively use Google's digital wallet, while also making PayPal a more common choice for consumers making in-store purchases.PayPal Dominates Online, But Not In-StoreFor years, PYPL has led the industry; last year, PayPal processedmore than 6 billion mobile transactionsworth more than $350 billion. As of December 2016, PayPal held a commanding lead in the mobile payments industry, with76% of digital wallet users reporting that they used PYPL.The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for the Next DecadeThe second most popular digital wallet service,Amazon.com, Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AMZN) Amazon Pay, trailed PayPal by more than 50 percentage points. And, not surprisingly, the mobile payment services offered by competitors Google andApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) were used by only 14% and 12% of smartphone owners, respectively.Samsung Electronic(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) sat at the bottom of the ladder with a mere 6% of users claiming to actually use the company's digital wallet.Clearly, PayPal dominates the online payment arena. However, since the launch of Apple Pay in October 2014, and thanks to AAPL's subsequent massive push to become the premier in-store digital payment option, PYPL has slipped to No. 2 on thelist of retailers that accept digital payment methods.Undoubtedly, this was a contributing factor in the company's decision to partner with Google. Even though Android Pay is even lower on the list, with only 24% of retailers reportedly accepting the smartphone payment service, the idea is that, together, PYPL and GOOGL stand a much better chance of overtaking Apple and gaining some meaningful market share.What This Means for PYPL and GOOGL ShareholdersThe partnership between PayPal and Google will likely have a more significant beneficial effect on PYPL stock than on GOOGL stock. Even though PayPal sits high atop the mobile payments mountain, shares of PYPL stock will be more greatly influenced as investors learn of the partnership arrangement. GOOGL stock, however, probably won't react much.Interestingly, the inverse is likely to be the case with respect to consumer and retailer use and acceptance of these mobile payment services. According toStatista,99% of online users in the U.S. are familiar with PayPal. It stands to reason, then, that Android Pay has much more potential to grow in popularity as both companies promote their new partnership.As of this writing, Greg Gambone did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace7 Energy Stocks That Will Turn 2017 on Its Head5 Tech Stocks to Buy for Growth AND DividendsNetflix, Inc.

Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Stock Will Soar With the Rising Cloud;4/20/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSomething is causing great consternation amongNvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA) investors, who are down nearly 6% on their investments so far in 2017. That's after NVDA stock hit a high of more than $119 as recently as February.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockIn the original vision for cloud computing, a decade ago, it was an article of faith that the cloud was designed to harness cheap, low-power chips and combine their resources to get the most bang for a computing buck.The advent of artificial intelligence, and the need for clouds to support AI, is forcing a re-think.This is highlighted byAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL) - the artist formerly known as Google, the first company to bring the cloud to glory -designing its own machine learning chip, dubbed a Tensor Processing Unit. It is said to deliver a lot more price-performance than ""competing"" processors fromIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) and, to our point, Nvidia.But those who are bearish on NVDA stock are missing an important point.Everybody WinsFirst, the new Google chip was compared against an old Nvidia chip, not its newest design. More importantly, as Nvidia CEOJensen Huang wrote in a recent blog post, this is a war where every advanced chip company is going to win.The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for the Next Decade""Without accelerated computing,"" he wrote, ""the scale-out of AI is simply not practical."" Artificial intelligence, or deep learning, ""is a new computing model that has required the invention of a new computing architecture.""The design models that Nvidia has been using for graphics are ideal for deep learning, and thus for delivering AI at scale. This was the point whenAlibaba Group Holding Ltd(NYSE:BABA)announced more than a year agoit would ally with NVDA on cloud AI for its ""AliCloud.""Google may order production of a bunch of Tensor chips for its cloud processing centers, but do you thinkAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) orMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) are going to be filing big orders for a direct cloud competitor's processors?Not when there are alternatives around, and there are. As Mr. Huang noted, Nvidia has one.A Needless KerfuffleNvidia did $6.9 billion worth of business for the quarter ending in January, mainly for graphics processors used in game machines, and its last two quarters indicate fiscal 2018 sales will run well over $8 billion.The April quarter is notoriously weak because most new models come out in the fall for delivery at Christmas.

Apple Inc. (AAPL) Won’t Buy Walt Disney Co (DIS) – But It Will Do This;4/20/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsA report from RBC Capital Markets last week suggested thatApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) could acquireWalt Disney Co(NYSE:DIS). Analyst Amit Daryanani said that multiple investors had asked him about the possibility of a merger between Apple and Disney, arguing that there wasa non-zero possibilityof such a deal occurring.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockA combination of AAPL and Disney stock would be the largest merger in history - and in RBC's estimation, a strong positive for Apple stock.The idea has been greeted with almost universal skepticism, and the report had little, if any, impact on trading in Apple shares. Indeed, the merger seems highly unlikely.But it does appear that Apple, which traditionally has shunned major acquisitions, could be in the market for a bigger target. That target may not be Disney. But there's reason to believe Apple has a major deal in its future.What Would an Apple-Disney Merger Cost?Disney has an enterprise value of about $196 billion at the moment. Apple likely would offer a roughly 40% premium for Disney stock. In that case, the acquisition would cost Apple about $267 billion, including assumption of debt.The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for the Next DecadeThat's a huge price tag, obviously - but it's not insurmountable. Apple could fund at least some of the purchase price with Apple stock. Apple already has about $226 billion in cash and securities as well. The one major problem is that most of the cash remains trapped overseas.If the Trump administration can't push through a repatriation holiday, the cash portion of a Disney acquisition could be tougher to fund.Would Disney Benefit AAPL Stock?The strategic value of such a deal for Apple and AAPL stock is more complicated. On its face, the addition of Disney's content would provide a huge leg up to Apple's services business - notably both Apple TV and Apple Music. Apple has been trying to put together a streaming TV package for years -only to fall behindAlphabet Inc's(NASDAQ:GOOGL) YouTube, among others. Disney's ABC and ESPN properties could form the beginning of a content package that could rival YouTube streaming,Huluand other bundles.The counterargument is that adding Disney could ruin Apple's ambitions in TV. The whole point of providing a streaming platform is to be provider-agnostic, something that Apple is … but it wouldn't be if it owned Disney's programming. Would a provider likeAMC Networks Inc(NASDAQ:AMCX) want to licenseThe Walking Deadto an Apple TV package if Apple also is a major competitor?The most interesting aspect of the deal would be Apple's ownership of ESPN. ESPN isstruggling badlywith cord-cutting, which threatens its business model of charging $7-plus per subscriber per month - whether subscribers are interested in sports or not. The Apple delivery system, from one standpoint, could invigorate ESPN.From another standpoint, however, ESPN would be an anchor.Liberty Media Corporation(NASDAQ:FWONA) CEO John Malonespeculated last yearthat Disney could split off ESPN and sell the rest of its assets to Apple for cash and/or Apple stock.Apple may not want to enter the live sports fray - and it may not be interested in what could be a long-term decline in ESPN viewership.All told, an Apple-Disney merger seems unlikely. Even RBC admitted as much … but that doesn't mean Apple isn't making a deal of some sort.The Big Apple DealOne argument against an AAPL-DIS merger is that Apple doesn't do big deals. Its purchase of Beats Music for $3 billion was the largest deal Apple has ever pulled off.But there's reason to think that strategy may change. In January, AAPL CEO Tim Cook said Apple's goal was to double services revenue in four years. AsFortunepointed out, that goal isunlikely without an acquisition- and it would take a reasonably large deal to get Apple to its ~$50 billion target. And Cook did say on the Q1 call that the company wasn't constrained by size in considering acquisition targets.That doesn't mean Disney will be the target, of course. But Apple's cash pile - particularly with some help from tax reform - and strategy creates a world of possibilities. Last September, another analystspeculatedabout an Apple takeover ofNetflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX).Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) Stock Drops After Earnings (As It Should)Bloomberg pointed out in February that Apple could have purchasedTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) to move along its self-driving car ambitions. The site also reported thatAT&T Inc.(NYSE:T) feared a competing bid from Apple forTime Warner Inc(NYSE:TWX).At some point, Apple likely will make a move. And the fact that Apple likely has to make such a move explains some of my skepticism toward Apple stock. The company simplyhasn't been able to drive growthbeyond the iPhone on its own. If it has to buy that growth, it could bring added risk to AAPL stock.As of this writing, Vince Martin did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace5 Oil Stocks Collapsing Under the Crude SelloffApple Inc.

Facebook (FB) F8 Developer Conference Day 2: Key Takeaways;4/20/2017;"Last year,FacebookFBhad announced a 10-year roadmap focused on augmented reality/virtual reality (AR/VR) and artificial intelligence (AI) technology, which will revolutionize the future. The second day of Facebook's (FB) F8 2017 developer conference was a continuation of the same and was full of jaw dropping announcements, including typing with brain and superior connectivity that aims to change the way we live.Key TakeawaysConnectivity:Facebook has consistently worked on offering faster connectivity across the globe. However, it is not working on a single technology in order to do so. Instead, it is ""designing different technologies for different use cases."" These will then be combined to ""create flexible and extensible networks."" Facebook also aims to bring down the cost of connectivity with these latest next gen technologies and make it available for all.Terragraph, the company's multi-node wireless system, is designed to boost connectivity in congested urban areas. After testing the system at its headquarters last year, Facebook tested its capabilities in San Jose's downtown corridor. The company says that it has reduced the ""failover rate"" to a ""blip"" by ""leveraging"" its ""software and networking expertise to create software that routes around obstructions in a split second, so the end user won't notice there was a lapse in connection.""On the other hand, to boost connectivity in remote parts of the world, the company is working on solar powered drones and MMW technologies. Facebook's solar powered drone, Aquila had a successful test flight last year. The company is currently working on conducting the second flight. As far as connectivity speeds are concerned, Facebook said that it has broken a few records. In case of wireless transfers, the company has achieved a point-to-point data rate of 36 Gbps over 13 km with MMW technology and 80 Gbps using the optical cross-link technology.Facebook, Inc. PriceFacebook, Inc. Price|Facebook, Inc. QuoteMore importantly, Facebook is working on Tether-tenna, a small helicopter ""tethered to a fiber line"" which can build an ""insta-infrastructure"" and beam Internet in areas affected by natural disasters, thus helping people stranded in those areas to remain connected to the world.Silent Speech Communication:Regina Dugan, head of Facebook's DARPA style research lab, Building 8, announced two of Facebook's most ambitious projects that delve into the area of silent speech communication. This does look straight out of a sci-fi flick.  Dugan said that in the future, people will be able to type with their brains at the rate of 100 words (almost five times faster than the typing speed on smartphone currently) per minute with the technology that Facebook is developing. For developing this technology, the company is working with non-invasive and wearable sensors. Apart from this, the company is working on another technology that will allow people to hear with their skin.Surround 360 Technology:Facebook has added two new cameras-x6 and x24-to its Surround 360 camera line. With these, users can shoot the ""most immersive and engaging content"" for VR, says Facebook. Moreover, with these cameras, users can see the world from various angles, essentially called 6DoF or the six degrees of freedom.AR Glasses:Oculus chief scientist of Research, Michael Abrash said that Facebook is working on AR glasses that will ""show virtual images overlaid on the real world."" Facebook added that ""The set of technologies needed to reach full AR doesn't exist yet. This is a decade-long investment and it will require major advances in material science, perception, graphics and many other areas. But once that's achieved, AR has the potential to enhance almost every aspect of our lives, revolutionizing how we work, play and interact.""ConclusionFacebook, like all other tech behemoths, AppleAAPL, Amazon, MicrosoftMSFT, Intel and AlphabetGOOGLis pumping ample resources to develop the next gen technologies-AR/VR and AI. These are expected to prove lucrative business opportunities, with research firm IDC claiming that AR/VR market will grow to a whopping 143.3 billion by 2020, while that for AI would be close to $46 billion.Zacks Rank & Stock Price MovementAt present, Facebook has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Under Armour Inc (UAA) Stock Stumbles by Going the Apple Way;4/20/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIn technology, there are two ways to introduce something. Think of them as theApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) way and theAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) or Google way.makeArticleAd();Source:SandyDover via Flickr (Modified)The Apple way seeks proprietary advantage. All intellectual property is tightly controlled. There is a price for everything. The brand absorbs the savings Moore's Law brings to the technology inside it, and profits.The Google way seeks market growth. You offer an open-source method that allows others to benefit. It's all free to try. You grow with the market.In the world of athletic technology,Under Armour Inc(NYSE:UAA) has chosen the Apple way. The market is killing it for this. Its offerings are being called""too technical""andteens are said to preferarch-rivalNike Inc.(NYSE:NKE).Really? Under Armour Is a Dog?InvestorPlacewriters agree. There's a ""glut"" of athleisure apparel,writes Joseph Hargett.UAA stock has a ""serious branding problem,""writes Vince Martin.Think twice,writes Will Ashworth.It's ""still a loser,""writes Josh Enomoto.The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for the Next DecadeI can't argue with them.Since its April 2016 stock split, meant to give founder and CEO Kevin Plank the control Google's founders have over the company, the shares are down 56%.The problem isn't in the financials. Under Armour's December quarter showed revenue of $1.305 billion, up from $1.170 billion a year earlier. Net income only fell marginally, from $105.6 million in 2015 to $103.23 million a year later. Debt is down, and cash flow is up.Yet the market has reacted as though UAA stock were going out of business. Shares fell from $29 to less than $22 immediately after the report came out, and opened for trade Apr 13 at $19.28. They need a change, and soon,writes James Brumley,because the March quarter looks terrible, witha loss of three cents per share expected,albeit on revenue of $1.14 billion.The change Under Armour needs is simple. Plank needs to find his inner Google.The Apple MistakeEverything about UAA stock today, like Apple, screams proprietary advantage.Stung by the failures of old retail partners like theSports Authority, Under Armour is opening its own stores. They even look like Apple stores,located in urban centers. Plank is even building his own ""spaceship,""a re-imagination of the waterfrontin his hometown of Baltimore.Don't be athletic, the company says.Be The Rock. In my fantasies, I would love to be Dwayne Johnson. Unfortunately, my mom gave birth to Dana Blankenhorn, with a bunion on one foot, and while I like my bicycle I am not going to spend all day working on my abs when I have stories to write. Apple, it should be noted, hasbarely 10% of the smartphone market.Winning in the mass market, it turns out, means winning in the mass market. Under Armour boughtMapMyFitnessfor $150 million in 2013, then spentanother $560 milliononMyFitnessPalandEndomondo, transforming them from tools for casual athletes into tools for elite athletes. As companies likeFitBit Inc(NYSE:FIT) captured the athletic band market, MapMyFitness refused to support them, in favor of competing Under Armour products.There's your problem. We can't all be The Rock. But we can be better Dana Blankenhorns, if technology will give us a chance. Under Armour needs to give us that chance.Aspiration vs. Reality for UAA StockBased on a discounted cash flow model, Under Armourshould be worth 44% morethan it presently is. Technically, the chart presentsa pretty compelling setup.General Electric Company (GE) Q1 Earnings Will Make or Break the StockAll Plank needs to do to score those gains is recognize the difference between a weekend athlete's aspiration and their reality. Athletic technology isn't just for elite athletes. It's for everyone. It's a lifestyle choice, to measure ourselves against yesterday and at least try to match it.Once Under Armour opens its technology to the mass market, taking advantage of Moore's Law rather than trying to fight it as Apple does, today's stock price will look like a bargain.Dana Blankenhornis a financial and technology journalist.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog includeApple(NASDAQ:AAPL-Free Report),IBM(NYSE:IBM-Free Report),Alphabet Inc.(NASDAQ:GOOGL-Free Report),Verizon(NYSE:VZ-Free Report) andQualcomm(NASDAQ:QCOM-Free Report).Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations.Get #1Stock of the Day pick for free.Here are highlights from Wednesday's Analyst   Blog:How to Invest in the ""Internet of Things""All around us, the world grows more intertwined every day. Thanks in part to our global web connections, we have the ability to interact with people and things on an incredible level. This online experience can be life-saving and important, or it can be as arbitrary as simplifying monotonous tasks.There are many industries and companies that aim to advance this experience. One growing market, known as the Internet of Things (IoT), connects our household or commercial items to a wireless network by embedding them with electronic, software, or sensor technology. This network of devices allows us to take the next step into a wireless world that relies less and less on direct human-to-computer interaction.You might actually be using products in the IoT without knowing it. Some common examples include the remote operation of a house's security system, wearable motion and activity tacking products, and even public trash bins that automatically alert a municipality when it is full.The Internet of Things is definitely present in our everyday lives right now, but it also has a lot more room to grow. According to research firm IDC, via theWall Street Journal, the IoT market could nearly triple in the coming years. In 2014, the global IoT market was worth $655.8 billion, but it could reach up to $1.7 trillion by the year 2020.With the industry showing that much room for growth, investors need to start thinking about investing in the IoT now, and we've highlighted a few companies and strategies for those who would like get the IoT into their portfolios.Big Name Patent HoldersOne of the most important steps a company needs to take to capitalize on emerging technology is locking down patents at the earliest possible point. In regards to the Internet of Things market, we've seen a lot of companies filing for patents that put them in a good position to grow as the IoT grows.One such company is technology behemoth Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL-Free Report). Apple holds a patent named ""Local Device Awareness"", which describes an automated relationship between multiple close-range devices. The technology could be used for position tracking, such as finding a lost remote control, or even proximity-based virtual reality, like a video game that depends on one's actual position in a room.Another major IoT patent holder is IBM (NYSE:IBM-Free Report). Primarily an information technology-focused company, IBM figures to be a major player in the IoT. Currently, IBM holds a patent regarding data filtering in Internet of Things devices, which describes a process in which devices receive and interpret information. This patent puts IBM amongst the frontrunners in technology that allows devices to communicate without human interaction.Furthermore, IBM just announced an Internet of Things partnership with Cisco. IBM will implement its Watson technology into Cisco's wide network of edge devices and end points in an effort to provide real-time feedback and data for the oil & gas, manufacturing, shipping, and mining industries.Today's Leading ProductsWhile patents are important for future growth and development, we also have to look at the already-available IoT devices. Again, we are looking at some of the world's biggest tech companies here.One of the more obvious industry leaders is Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL-Free Report) and its line of Nest home monitoring products. Alphabet, under the Google name at the time, acquired Nest for $3.2 billion in early 2014, and since then the brand has become one of the biggest names in home automation with its smart thermostats, smoke detectors, and safety cameras.(Also read:Google's New ""Home"" Internet of Things Device Challenges Amazon Echo)Finally, Samsung is another major player with its SmartThings brand. Samsung SmartThings are a series of in-home products, ranging from electric outlets to motion sensors, which allow for easier control of a users' entire home.5G RevolutionIt's also important to pay attention to the rise of 5G data networks. The term ""5G"" is short for ""5th generation mobile networks,"" and it refers to the proposed telecommunications standards that will replace the current 4G standards.While previous standards have focused on human-to-human communication, 5G will need to power the growing Internet of Things and other technologies that seek to bring people closer to the world around them.Telecom giants like Verizon (NYSE:VZ-Free Report) have been building up their portfolios of 5G-compatible wireless spectrum, while chipmakers like Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM-Free Report) are focused on building the needed hardware (also read:Here's How To Invest In The 5G Data Revolution).Bottom LineThe Internet of Things has the potential to change the consumer electronics industry as we know it. The growth of the market will be another indication of humanity's expansion into an autonomous world, and investors need to start taking note of the IoT now.Whether you want to focus on the major technology players or the small companies at the heart of the IoT movement, the time is now to add this industry to your portfolio.Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations.Get #1 Stock of the Day pick for free.About Zacks Equity ResearchZacks Equity Research provides the best of quantitative and qualitative analysis to help investors know what stocks to buy and which to sell for the long-term.Continuous coverage is provided for a universe of 1,150 publicly traded stocks.

Earnings: 2 Tech Stocks to Watch Next Week;4/20/2017;"Earnings season is well under way, and a handful of big names   are on deck. Next week's earnings releases notably includeAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) andTwitter(NYSE:TWTR) -- two tech stocks that could see big moves.Here's what investors should watch when Twitter reports its   results on Wednesday, April 26, and Alphabet reports on Thursday,   April 27.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();Can Twitter restore investor confidence?Going into Twitter's first-quarter report, investors seem to   have little confidence in the company's ability to turnaround its   business. With shares trading at $14.54 at the time of this   writing, they're less than a dollar away from an all-time low of   $13.73 and are down 15.1% in the past three months. Twitter's   worse-than-expected revenue in its most recent quarter, combined   with slow revenue growth recently, has set the bar low.Analysts have a gloomy outlook for the quarter. On average,   analysts expect Twitter to report revenue and non-GAAP EPS of   $513 million and $0.01, respectively, down from $595 million and   $0.15 in the year-ago quarter.In Twitter's fourth-quarter shareholder letter, management   said it's seen ""increased competitive pressure resulting in a   decline in our original Promoted Tweet engagement format."" WithFacebook's popularity with advertisersshowing no signs of letting up, and the social network continuing to rapidly innovate with its   ad products across its core Facebook app and Instagram,   competitive pressure could continue to hurt Twitter.Investors should look for management to provide some concrete   evidence of a turnaround.Will Alphabet live up to high expectations?Unlike with Twitter, investors have high expectations for   Alphabet when the company reports first-quarter results on   Thursday. Look no further than the stock's price-to-earnings   ratio of 30 for insight into just how bullish investors are on   the company's growth potential. This P/E ratio is well above the   average P/E ratio of 24.5 of stocks in the S&P 500 and tech   peerApple's P/E ratio of 16.9.On average, analysts expect Alphabet to report revenue and   non-GAAP EPS of $24.2 billion and $7.38, respectively. While   analysts' consensus estimate for non-GAAP EPS is below non-GAAP   EPS of $7.50 in the year-ago quarter, investors should keep in   mind that Alphabet isno longer excluding stock-based compensation from   its non-GAAP resultsstarting with its first quarter of 2017. So it makes sense that   Alphabet's non-GAAP EPS would decline year over year. Analysts'   consensus estimate for Alphabet's revenue is a better reflection   of the company's growth. A consensus estimate for revenue of   $24.2 billion is up 19.4% year over year.Beyond Alphabet's total revenue growth and its adjusted EPS,   investors may want to look out for any commentary from management   about mobile search and YouTube -- two areas of the company's   business that have served as key catalysts for growth   recently.In addition, investors should look for an update on Alphabet's   ""other bets"" revenue. While still representing only a fraction of   total revenue, the segment saw its revenue soar 75% in the   company's most recent quarter, hitting $262 million. Further, its   operating loss narrowed from $1.2 billion to $1.1 billion.Twitter reports its first-quarter results before the market   opens on Wednesday, and Alphabet reports its first-quarter   resultsafter the market closeson Thursday.

Apple Inc. Wants to Make Recycled iPhones;4/20/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsApple(NASDAQ:AAPL) isn't just the world's most valuable company - it's well on its way to being the greenest as well.makeArticleAd();In the lead-up to Earth Day 2017, Apple released its 2017 Environmental Sustainability progress report. The company continues to make progress in its goals, including the use of renewable power for its own facilities as well as by its suppliers. And it added a lofty new pledge to the list: Apple says it is pursuing a ""closed-loop supply chain"" that would see it cease mining and instead build all of its products entirely from recycled materials.But it's still not big on having an iPhone last more than three years of practical life, or having you fix it yourself.Apple Continues to Lead Green Technology CompaniesApple has built a reputation as a green technology company. In 2012, it committed to transitioning to 100% renewable energy and has increasingly emphasized environmental sustainability in its products and packaging. In 2017, Greenpeace named Applethe most environmentally friendly major technology company- a title it has held for three years straight.Other major tech players likeAlphabet Inc.(NASDAQ:GOOGL) andFacebookInc(NASDAQ:FB) score well in many areas, but AAPL continues to lead the pack. The company released the 2017 update to its annual Environmental Sustainability report, showing just how much progress it has made.Source: AppleApple wants to keep up its role as one of the planet's greenest tech companies.2017 Environmental Sustainability Progress ReportWith Earth Day coming this weekend, Apple's progress report release was timely. It shows a company that continues to push green technology and environmental sustainability at a massive scale.The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for the Next DecadeTwo primary areas - transitioning partners onto renewable energy and the new goal of implementing a closed-loop supply chain - remain a work in progress. But otherwise, the report shows the company continues to make great strides.Among the milestones achieved in the past year:100% of electricity used by Apple's data centers and 96% of power used by its facilities worldwide comes from renewable energy (primarily solar, wind and hydro)Working with suppliers to bring 4 gigawatts of renewable energy online by 2020 (with around 750 megawatts currently operational and 2 gigawatts committed)99% of Apple packaging is recycled or responsibly sourced from sustainable forests (iPhone 7 boxes made from a mix of responsibly sourced paper, bamboo and waste sugarcane)Use of laser-induced breakdown spectrometers to ensure materials used in products are safeMoving to a Closed-Loop Supply ChainRight now, the biggest knock against technology companies like Apple is the massive mining operations needed to supply raw materials - aluminum, copper, lithium and other elements. Mines are an environmental nightmare, they're dangerous for workers and they're often located in conflict regions.To solve this part of the equation, Apple is now committing to a closed-loop supply chain. This means using high-quality recycled materials - and even harvesting components from old AAPL products - instead of mining.A recycled iPhone, in other words.Source:Yanki01 via Flickr (Modified)Can Apple make a recycled iPhone?This goal is further in the future, but it's something Apple says it is moving toward.What the companywon'tdo in the name of green technology is build an iPhone with an extended useful life, or one that users can repair themselves instead of having to take it to an Apple Store.Apple's VP of Environment, Policy and Social Initiatives gave an interviewwithViceto discuss the company's environmental sustainability initiatives. She talked up the closed-loop supply chain commitment, noting that it would also let AAPL certify its products as being ""conflict-free.""Apple Inc. (AAPL) iPhone 8 Facing a Resurgent Samsung (SSNLF)However, she stopped short at the idea of an iPhone having a useful life of beyond three years and deflected the proposal of designing smartphones so customers could undertake basic repairs (like replacing adead iPhone battery) by themselves.""I think trying to pretend that we can sort of make it easy to repair the product, and that you get the product that you think you're buying - that you want - isn't the answer.""Son't expect iPhone owners to be able to swap out that cracked screen themselves any time soon. However, Apple fans can take heart in the fact that they're buying from the world's most environmentally friendly tech company.And someday, they will be able to buy a recycled iPhone, thanks to Apple's new commitment to pursuing a closed-loop supply chain.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceCommit to Apple Inc.

Should You Buy Facebook Inc (FB) Stock? 3 Pros, 3 Cons;4/20/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsInvestors that purchasedFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) stock at the post-IPO lows could be forgiven for thinking they are in Oculus' virtual reality universe. After all, you don't get many chances to buy stocks that go up 7x in under five years. Anyone who believed in Zuckerberg's entrepreneurial skills has earned a great reward.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockBut, as always, Wall Street is a forward-looking mechanism. Is expensive FB stock still worth purchasing today, or has its explosive growth phase run its course?According to the analysts, Facebook has at least another five great years ahead. But don't overlook the potential pitfalls that could sink FB stock before then.FB Stock ConsExpensive Stock: Facebook stock is particularly expensive, trading at more than 40 times earnings. There are plenty of reasons to be optimistic about FB's future. However, valuation still matters, regardless of how good the company's fundamentals may be.When you compare Facebook toAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), it is hard to justify the stock's price. Alphabet is trading at 30 times earnings and has an equally compelling growth story, at least in my view.7 Top Emerging Markets Stocks to Buy NowAging Userbase: A recentarticlecompiled evidence of FB's aging userbase. It's worth remembering that even teens who signed up with FB at the time of the initial iPhone launch are now in their mid-20s. A 2014 study found that more than half of 65-and-up aged persons had a Facebook account. That number has surely risen since then - and the majority of new users are older folks who already have many contacts using the company's online platform.Younger users, by contrast, are more likely to sign up for Instagram, Snapchat, Tumblr or other such alternatives. This isn't all bad news. FB obviously controls one of those. And younger users aren't nearly as valuable to advertisers as older ones; the advertising value of Facebook's core audience grows as users mature and obtain higher incomes. However, to the extent that FB stock is valued as a way to play a younger audience, it needs to have success with Instagram and other platforms aimed at teens as its core product is seen as increasingly stale.Virtual Reality Disappointment: Virtual reality is expected to be a huge market, with some experts suggesting it will be a $30 billion opportunity by 2020. Much of the excitement around FB stock comes from its early mover role there. However, recent signs out of Oculus Rift suggest reasons to be cautious.Facebook recently closed nearly half the Oculus pop-up stores withinBest Buy Co Inc(NYSE:BBY) stores due to poor customer demand. Oculus cut prices for both the Rift and the touch controller by $100 each.This could just be a bleeding-edge tech problem. The VR ecosystem simply isn't that big yet; once more products are introduced except customer demand to pick up. A few high-profile games could turn virtual reality's fortunes around. However, to the extent VR is already baked into FB stock, there is real risk of disappointment.FB Stock ProsNeutralizing Threats: Facebook stock faces a key threat. If people leave their platform, the stock would collapse. Unlike say Alphabet, which has many ways to reach customers with ads, the social media company is more platform-dependent. One of the big bear points with Facebook is that younger people aren't nearly as excited about Facebook as older folks. FB stock bears will inevitably break out the MySpace analogy sooner or later.However, Facebook has now shown that it is capable of deflecting threats from insurgent platforms. For a few years,Twitter Inc(NYSE:TWTR) appeared to be a real threat. Hardly anyone thinks that anymore. Google Plus came and went with little effect. What it can't beat, it can buy. FB's acquisitions of WhatsApp and Instagram, both decried as expensive at the time, have paid off in spades.Down Goes Snap: Expanding on that previous point, Facebook has taken seemingly decisive steps to neutralize its latest rival. Shares ofSnap Inc(NYSE:SNAP) went public earlier this year with great fanfare. However, SNAP stock hasn't performed well. From its opening print around $24, it briefly traded higher but has sold off and now is struggling to hold the $20-mark. Why have investors turned on SNAP stock?In large part, it's because FB is moving to crush Snap. The company recently decided to clone many of Snap's features within its Instagram Stories platform. That decision is paying off in spades. Instagram Moments has now passed the200 million usermark, up 50 million already for the year. More importantly, it makes Instagram Moments more popular than Snapchat, which tallies only 161 million daily users. Remember, Instagram Moments only launched last August and it has already overtaken Snapchat. While bears are right about Facebook's namesake platform showing its age, don't underestimate the company's ability to compete for younger users with other services.Twenty-First Century Fox Inc (FOXA) Isn't a Factor Without Bill O'ReillyBig EPS Growth Ahead: Analysts have set high marks for FB stock. The consensus Street price target is $160.72. Even after the big run in Facebook stock, $161 would represent a solid win from today's price.More impressively, analysts expect earnings to grow 28% this year. Given the company's track record for smashing earnings estimates, that represents a really good base level of growth, which FB could well beat. Over the next five years, analysts forecast earnings to grow at a 23% per year rate compounded. At that clip, earnings double every three years. FB would be far more profitable and have a low price-to-earnings ratio by 2022 based on today's price if that earnings growth plays out.Bottom Line on Facebook StockFB stock has become increasingly attractive over the last two years. The company shook off the first big bearish point, solving the mobile monetization problem. Now it has created successful secondary platforms to attract younger users. Unfortunately, Facebook stock fully reflects these developments. It has soared in recent years. You can make the argument to buy a great company, even at merely a fair price. However, for my money, I'd rather wait for a stock market correction that causes a big shake-out in FB stock before purchasing.At this time of this writing, Ian Bezek held no positions in any of the aforementioned stocks.

Forget IBM, Buy These Tech Stocks for Growth Instead;4/19/2017;"International Business Machines CorpIBMhas been a disappointment for growth savvy investors' due to its sluggish results in the last five years. We note that since 2011, the company's top-line has declined annually, which has affected earnings growth rate despite sizeable share buybacks and cost saving initiatives over the period.makeArticleAd();IBM has been moving away from its traditional businesses to newer (read lucrative) business avenues like cloud and data analytics. Though IBM's ""Strategic Imperatives"" (cloud, analytics, mobility and security) are performing well, the recently announced first-quarter 2017 results exhibited that these are not enough to suffice the weakness in traditional businesses yet.We note that the overall weakness has hurt IBM's returns in the last five years. The company has lost 18.3% against S&P 500's gain of 73.1%.Intensifying Competition Hurting ProfitabilityWe believe that intensifying competition in most of the ""Strategic Imperatives"" is hurting IBM's profitability. This is primarily due to continuing investment, which is necessary in order to remain competitive.The cloud computing market is currently dominated by AmazonAMZNthrough its Amazon Web Services. We note that the fight for the #2 place is intensifying owing to the growing presence of MicrosoftMSFT, AlphabetGOOGL, salesforce.com and Oracle. This has affected IBM's gross margin in the last couple of years.We note that gross margin in 2016 contracted 190 basis points (bps) over 2015. In the recently concluded quarter, non-GAAP gross margin contracted a massive 300 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter.Newer Techs Still in Nascent StageAlthough IBM has been expanding product portfolio into newer technologies like Blockchain, Quantum computing and Containers through frequent acquisitions, we believe that these are still in nascent stage and will take some time to contribute meaningfully towards top-line growth.Moreover, sluggish IT spending is a concern for IBM. Gartner in its latest report projects IT spending to increase 1.4% over 2016 to $3.5 trillion in 2017. The figure is much lower than earlier projection of 2.7% growth.Although estimated improvement in data center spending is good for IBM, slowing spending on enterprise software and IT services are huge concerns.Alternative PicksCurrently, IBM has aGrowth Style Scoreof 'D' and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Back-tested results show that stocks with Growth Style Scores of 'A' or 'B,' when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) handily outperform other stocks.

5 Must-See New Quotes From Netflix, Inc. Management;4/19/2017;"WhileNetflix's(NASDAQ: NFLX) slower-than-expected subscriber growth in its   first quarter has received lots of attention since the results   were posted earlier this week, investors shouldn't overlook the   valuable insights in the streaming-TV company's earnings call.   Key topics during the call included a look at Netflix's   international potential, why management envies YouTube, what to   expect from the U.S. market, and more.Here are five telling quotes (via a Reuterstranscript) from Netflix's first-quarter earnings call.Image source: Netflix.makeArticleAd();The internet: still a ""phenomenal opportunity""Noting that the company expects to cross the 100 million   subscriber mark this weekend, one analyst asked Netflix CEO Reed   Hastings about what hitting this milestone means for the   company's longer-term outlook. In Hastings answer, he turned his   focus to the big opportunity on the internet.[Crossing 100 million subscribers] is a big accomplishment.     But it's really just the beginning. When you look at YouTube     having 1 billion active users and 1 billion hours every day,     when you look at Facebook's multi-billion numbers, we see that     the Internet is just a phenomenal opportunity.Hastings was careful to emphasize that, unlikeFacebookandAlphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) YouTube, Netflix is a paid   service and is not ad supported. But he also noted that Netflix   isn't as entrenched in international markets as these   companies.Perspective on Netflix's international potentialTo help investors put Netflix's international opportunity into   context, Netflix CFO David Wells noted that the company's uncanny   penetration in the U.S. market bodes well for abroad   potential.I mean, if we can get -- my God, if we can get penetration     levels outside the U.S. to be anywhere close to the U.S.,     you're implying multiple hundreds of millions of global     subscribers with the U.S. [penetration] beyond 50%.Netflix envies YouTubeAsked about user consumption on Netflix, Hastings said that   while user viewing is ""very large and growing,"" it's ""nowhere   near as big as YouTube's, so we definitely got YouTube envy and   we've got a lot of room to go.""Netflix has good reason to envy YouTube. It's a juggernaut.   With over a billion monthly active users, YouTube is not only the   world's largest streaming video platform, but it's also one of   theworld's largest social networks. In addition, Alphabet says people watch hundreds of millions of   hours of videos on YouTube and generate hundreds of billions of   viewsevery day.Image source: Netflix.Expect more growth in the U.S.While Netflix's 1.4 million U.S. member additions in Q1 were   lower than its 2.23 million domestic additions in the year-ago   quarter, Hastings is still optimistic about growth potential in   the U.S. market.The U.S. market is continuing to grow very nicely. I don't     see any fixed wall. I mean, of course, every incremental 10     million is a little harder than the last 10 million, but our     content keeps getting better, so those forces offset each     other. When you look at the last 5 years, everyone's worried     every quarter about saturation in the U.S., and we just     continued to grow. But it doesn't mean it's going to be     inherently forever. But we certainly feel good about the near     term as we're expanding and just getting bigger content budget,     more shows, more marketing.As these quotes show, one overarching theme stood out from the   call: Though Netflix member growth has slowed, management is   adamant that its total subscriber count is far from peaking.10 stocks we like better than NetflixWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock       tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they       have run for over a decade,Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has tripled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy right now... and Netflix wasn't one of       them!

F8 Conference: Facebook Inc (FB) Bets Big on AR;4/19/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) is on the second day of its F8Developer Conference. Yesterday was the keynote by CEO Mark Zuckerberg, and it painted a picture of a company that's doubling down on augmented reality. It also laid out the groundwork for a Facebook that's planning to take on everything fromSnap Inc(NYSE:SNAP) to consumer electronics giants to smartphones.makeArticleAd();Source: FacebookF8 and the Rise of ARFor a while there, Facebook was all about virtual reality. It hasn't given up on the idea of social VR - after all, it spent $2 billion to buyOculus VRin 2014 - and at F8 the company was showing off the Facebook Spaces VR app.But it's doubling down onaugmented reality.New developer tools in the form of the Facebook Camera Effects platform will let developers release AR apps that can run using the existing Facebook mobile app's camera functionality. This technology will let these apps overlay virtual objects onto the real world view. It's an approach thatPokemon Goproved could be a smash hit, helping to push it as the next big thing.AR is something thatMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) is pursuing with its HoloLens, andApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is expected to make akey feature of its 10th anniversary iPhone 8.5 Tech Stocks to Buy for Growth AND DividendsHowever, Facebook has a different vision. At F8, the version of AR it was showing off starts with apps piggybacking on the Facebook app, so the nextPokemon Gomight actually be played on Facebook instead of being downloaded from the App Store.And FB is pursuing a future where advanced eyeglasses - very similar in appearance to Snapchat Spectacles - take the place of screens and clumsy VR headsets. The AR glasses would let the wearer view virtual objects overlaid on top of a real world view, without the need to look at a smartphone screen.Apple's Targets: Smartphones, Tablets, TVsThe F8 keynote showed that Facebook's ambitions for VR go far beyond the smartphone. In fact, if the company has its way, AR glasses could eventually replace not only the smartphone, but also other screened devices like tablets and televisions.As Zuckerberg said during the keynote: ""We don't need a physical TV.

"How to Invest in the ""Internet of Things""";4/19/2017;"All around us, the world grows more intertwined every day. Thanks in part to our global web connections, we have the ability to interact with people and things on an incredible level. This online experience can be life-saving and important, or it can be as arbitrary as simplifying monotonous tasks.There are many industries and companies that aim to advance this experience. One growing market, known as the Internet of Things (IoT), connects our household or commercial items to a wireless network by embedding them with electronic, software, or sensor technology. This network of devices allows us to take the next step into a wireless world that relies less and less on direct human-to-computer interaction.You might actually be using products in the IoT without knowing it. Some common examples include the remote operation of a house's security system, wearable motion and activity tacking products, and even public trash bins that automatically alert a municipality when it is full.The Internet of Things is definitely present in our everyday lives right now, but it also has a lot more room to grow. According to research firm IDC, via theWall Street Journal, the IoT market could nearly triple in the coming years. In 2014, the global IoT market was worth $655.8 billion, but it could reach up to $1.7 trillion by the year 2020.With the industry showing that much room for growth, investors need to start thinking about investing in the IoT now, and we've highlighted a few companies and strategies for those who would like get the IoT into their portfolios.ETF SuccessPerhaps the easiest way for investors to make a play on the Internet of Things is with a themed ETF. If that interests you, check out Global X Internet of Things Thematic ETFSNSR, the first IoT-related ETF on the market.Big Name Patent HoldersOne of the most important steps a company needs to take to capitalize on emerging technology is locking down patents at the earliest possible point. In regards to the Internet of Things market, we've seen a lot of companies filing for patents that put them in a good position to grow as the IoT grows.One such company is technology behemoth AppleAAPL. Apple holds a patent named ""Local Device Awareness"", which describes an automated relationship between multiple close-range devices. The technology could be used for position tracking, such as finding a lost remote control, or even proximity-based virtual reality, like a video game that depends on one's actual position in a room.Another major IoT patent holder is IBMIBM. Primarily an information technology-focused company, IBM figures to be a major player in the IoT. Currently, IBM holds a patent regarding data filtering in Internet of Things devices, which describes a process in which devices receive and interpret information. This patent puts IBM amongst the frontrunners in technology that allows devices to communicate without human interaction.Furthermore, IBM just announced an Internet of Things partnership with Cisco SystemsCSCO. IBM will implement its Watson technology into Cisco's wide network of edge devices and end points in an effort to provide real-time feedback and data for the oil & gas, manufacturing, shipping, and mining industries.Today's Leading ProductsWhile patents are important for future growth and development, we also have to look at the already-available IoT devices. Again, we are looking at some of the world's biggest tech companies here.One of the more obvious industry leaders is Alphabet Inc.GOOGLand its line of Nest home monitoring products. Alphabet, under the Google name at the time, acquired Nest for $3.2 billion in early 2014, and since then the brand has become one of the biggest names in home automation with its smart thermostats, smoke detectors, and safety cameras.Another leader in the IoT market right now is AmazonAMZN. Amazon's Dash Buttons, which allow users to re-order specific products with the click of an actual physical button that can be placed anywhere in the home, could be considered an entry-level IoT device. Additionally, the company's Echo smart speakers, which utilize its Alexa home connectivity technology, are probably the most popular consumer IoT product on the market right nowGoogle actually recently responded to Amazon's Echo speaker with a home automation device of its own, the Google Home. The Home runs on Google's new voice assistant, which also powers its new Pixel phone and represents Google's new era of hardware/software interaction.(Also read:Google's New ""Home"" Internet of Things Device   Challenges Amazon Echo)Finally, SamsungSSNLFis another major player with its SmartThings brand. Samsung SmartThings are a series of in-home products, ranging from electric outlets to motion sensors, which allow for easier control of a users' entire home.Unsung HeroesThe technology giants will certainly be leaders in the IoT market, but investors should also look into the smaller companies that will be the manufacturers of the actual hardware. For every product IoT product sold by Apple, the supplier who built one of the components within the device also stands to benefit.One of Apple's key suppliers is Skyworks SolutionsSWKS. Skyworks is the industry leader in semiconductor manufacturing and currently produces a chip that is a vital part of the iPhone. Similar technology will be the backbone of the IoT movement, as semiconductors and sensors move beyond their usual homes in phones and computers and into our other household items. Skyworks is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Investors should also focus on some smaller cap stocks that have potential to grow in correlation with the IoT market. One such company would be Sierra WirelessSWIR, a wireless communications expert with a product line that should fit perfectly in the IoT market.Another company to consider is Iridium CommunicationsIRDM, a low-Earth orbit satellite company that has recently partnered with IoT platform providers as the industry has discovered a use for LEOs in connecting the world.5G RevolutionIt's also important to pay attention to the rise of 5G data networks. The term ""5G"" is short for ""5th generation mobile networks,"" and it refers to the proposed telecommunications standards that will replace the current 4G standards.While previous standards have focused on human-to-human communication, 5G will need to power the growing Internet of Things and other technologies that seek to bring people closer to the world around them.Telecom giants like AT&TTand VerizonVZhave been building up their portfolios of 5G-compatible wireless spectrum, while chipmakers like QualcommQCOMare focused on building the needed hardware (also read:Here's How To Invest In The 5G Data Revolution).Bottom LineThe Internet of Things has the potential to change the consumer electronics industry as we know it. The growth of the market will be another indication of humanity's expansion into an autonomous world, and investors need to start taking note of the IoT now.Whether you want to focus on the major technology players or the small companies at the heart of the IoT movement, the time is now to add this industry to your portfolio.Also, investors interested in the Internet of Things should check out this episode of theZacks Friday Finish Linepodcast:Zacks' Top 10 Stocks for 2017In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2017?Who wouldn't?

IBM's Cloud Computing Holds Major Potential: Should You Buy?;4/19/2017;"International Business Machines Corp.'sIBMinvestor briefing last month reflected its continuing focus on being a cloud-first company. In 2016, cloud revenues grew 35% to $13.7 billion, while the annual exit run rate for cloud-as-a-service revenue increased 53% on a year-over-year basis to $8.6 billion.In itslatest quarterly earnings report, the tech giant reported cloud segmental revenue growth of 45% from the prior-year period. Additionally, IBM has over 50 cloud centers globally, and its Bluemix platform was one of the largest open public cloud deployments worldwide at the end of 2016.IBM's Watson on Cloud is also a key growth driver for the company. The company expects Watson to reach over 1 billion people by the end of 2017, and IBM estimates the market for Watson on Cloud as a decision-making support system to be worth nearly $2 trillion by 2025.Cloud Computing: Robust Growth ExpectationsIBM's growth expectations from cloud computing remain positive in the long haul. Management anticipates market opportunity in enterprise cloud to be greater than $800 billion by 2020. Moreover, the company expects more than 85% of enterprises to commit to multi-cloud architectures by 2018, which is positive for its hybrid cloud offerings.The overall growth expectation for the public cloud computing services market is very bullish. According to Gartner, the worldwide public cloud services market was projected to grow 18% through 2016 to $246.8 billion in 2017. This figure will increase to $383.3 billion by 2020.makeArticleAd();Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) is projected to be the highest growth service driven by improvement in platform-as-a-service (PaaS) and massive adoption of artificial intelligence (AI), analytics and the Internet of Things (IoT). IaaS is projected to grow from $25.29 billion in 2016 to $71.55 billion in 2020.IBM Lags Behind in the CloudDespite impressive growth figures and bullish sentiments, IBM lags behind the likes of AmazonAMZNand MicrosoftMSFTin the public PaaS and IaaS cloud computing markets. According to Synergy Research's latest report, Amazon Web Services (AWS) maintained its dominant position in the market followed by Microsoft's Azure, Alphabet'sGOOGLGoogle, and IBM at the end of fourth-quarter 2016.The research firm noted that these three have gained market share in the last one year at the expense of smaller players, as well as strong growth from both Microsoft and Google. However, their combined market share of 23% lags compared with Amazon's 40%.We believe that IBM's hybrid approach has yet to find many takers in both the public and private cloud markets. Despite significant investments - first on acquiring SoftLayer for $2 billion and then spending more than $1 billion on data centers - its client list is not as impressive as Amazon's or Microsoft's.China: IBM's Savior?Per Gartner, China has become a significant IaaS cloud market. The research firm noted that ""While China's cloud service market is nascent and several years behind the U.S. and European markets, it is expected to maintain high levels of growth as digital transformation becomes more mainstream over the next five years.""IBM is now planning to tap into China's fast-growing cloud computing market through a new company formed in collaboration with Wanda Internet Technology Group. The new company will offer IaaS and PaaS to Chinese businesses. Reportedly, IBM will have a share in revenues.Moreover, as a part of the deal, the company will launch Watson services to China. IBM is expected to offer Watson Conversation services, which will allow developers to add natural language interactions between clients and applications.Bottom LineIn its Q1 earnings report, IBM reported a bigger-than-expected drop in revenue, marking the 20thconsecutive quarterly sales decline. Demand for its legacy hardware and software businesses is stagnating, but IBM has been slowly shifting towards cloud-based areas over the years.Despite lagging behind in comparison to its competition, IBM is developing a niche for its hybrid cloud services, along with ""Strategic Imperatives"" like cognitive computing, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. And with Watson, IBM is advancing in vital areas like Internet of Things, healthcare, and financial services end-markets that will support growth in the long run.5 Trades That Could Profit ""Big-League"" from Trump   PoliciesIf the stocks above spark your interest, wait until you look into companies primed to make substantial gains from Washington's changing course.Today, Zacks reveals 5 tickers that could benefit from new trends like streamlined drug approvals, tariffs, lower taxes, higher interest rates, and spending surges in defense and infrastructure.See these buy recommendations now >>Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Calls Upon a “Hire” Power to Reach $1,000;4/19/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL) closed April 18 at $853.99, up 7.8% on the year. That's a good showing when compared to the S&P 500, but GOOGL stock is a long way from hitting $1,000, the holy grail of stock prices.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockWord has gotten out in recent days that Google is working on a new recruitment tool that will help companies find quality recruits while managing the application and hiring process.Dubbed Google Hire, it's currently in limited testing, and could be a threat both to job boards likeLinkedInand job application tracking software such as Greenhouse and Lever.Huge Boost to AlphabetI've never understood why Google wasn'tdirectly involved in the HRbusiness given its understanding of information and its paying customers use it.Privacy concerns aside, if this product is remotely helpful in improving the hiring process for both employers and potential employees, it could be a huge boost to GOOGL stock. Here's why:Almost everyone who pays Google to advertise on its various platforms -InvestorPlacecontributor Dana Blankenhorn recently reminded readers here that Alphabet is stillgrowing ad revenues by 20%year-over-year on a quarterly basis - has some need for growing their businesses; one of the most important aspects is hiring the right people.10 Stocks That Won't Exist in a DecadeThe HR software market is said to be worth $14 billion annually in the U.S. alone. According to Aptos, Calif.-based research firm HRmarketer, companies spend $785 billion annually on employee benefits products and services, just one segment of the human resources pie.It's an industry that employs more than1.6 millionpeople in the U.S. whose job it is to manage their employer's talent.Potential Category KillerHRmarketer divides the HR marketplace into seven separate categories: Recruitment and staffing, compensation/payroll, employee benefits, talent management/employee relations, training and development, workforce planning and analytics, and legal and compliance.Google Hire is focusing on one segment of the HR marketplace, but there's no reason why it couldn't broaden its scope to cover some of these other areas.For example, if you've ever done any work with Google Analytics, you know how deep you can dive. Google has absolutely the right technology and people to compete in HR analytics. And that's just a second category.Now, I'm not saying thatMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) and all the other software behemoths out there can't do the same, because they can, but Google sits in a particularly convenient position to take advantage of this marketplace, one that is still very fragmented despite its size.""Forward-looking organizations are also beginning to employ simulations and gaming to connect with talent, particularly Millennials, and analyze whether candidates are primed to succeed in a given role,""suggested Deloitte authorsMichael Stephen, David Brown and Robin Erickson in a February 28, 2017, article about talent management.Some 71% of the global business leaders surveyed for the article rate their company as weak at using gaming and simulations to attract and assess potential candidates.GOOGL Stock Would Be Less Dependent on Ad RevenueThere's no reason Alphabet can't use its $36 billion in annual cash flow to roll up businesses currently competing in the various categories of the HR marketplace.Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Is Headed to $150 on EarningsIn December,I warned investorsthat GOOGL stock was a must-own in 2017, in part because of the revenue growth of its cloud business. Google Hire could become another tool in Alphabet's kit to generate more revenue from initiatives other than advertising which accounts for 89% of its overall sales.If you can book a flight through Google Flights or manage your communications and other business activities through Google Gmail and Google Drive, why not use Google to manage your hiring process and other HR-related activities?Soon, you'll be able to. And that's a great thing for GOOGL stock.As of this writing, Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace7 Energy Stocks That Will Turn 2017 on Its HeadHow Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Can Generate 370% Returns5 Tech Stocks to Buy for Growth AND DividendsThe postAlphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Calls Upon a ""Hire"" Power to Reach $1,000appeared first onInvestorPlace."

Baidu (BIDU) Stock Pops as Company Open Sources its Self-Driving Car Tech;4/19/2017;"Shares of Baidu, Inc.BIDUsaw a nice pop in early morning trading hours Wednesday, eventually gaining as much as 3.6%. The breakout comes on the same day that the Chinese internet giant announced it is open sourcing its self-driving car technology.By opening up its driverless vehicle technology for automakers to use, Baidu hopes to be the default autonomous driving platform. Today's move is a direct challenge to the other major players in the self-driving car market, including AlphabetGOOGLand TeslaTSLA.Baidu has dubbed the new open-source project ""Apollo,"" and it will focus on utilizing the company's strengths in artificial intelligence to build a collaborative driverless car ecosystem.""AI has great potential to drive social development, and one of AI's biggest opportunities is intelligent vehicles,"" said Baidu COO Qi Lu in apress release.Today's statement also included the announcement of a partnership alliance, wherein Baidu will work alongside other companies to provide the best hardware and promote participation in the project.""This will lower the barriers to entry for research and development of autonomous driving technologies, making it more accessible to the general public, and accelerate the overall pace of innovation,"" the company said.The news comes just a few weeks after Baidu CEO Robin Li addressed the possibility of spinning off its self-driving car unit into its own separate company (also read:Is Baidu Poised to Gain from Driverless Car Unit Spin Off?).""When we think business is promising enough and it has reached a stage that running it independently or introducing more strategic investors would make sense, we will do that,"" Li said.The company has been working on developing an artificial-intelligence platform that combines its own cloud platform with NVIDIA'sNVDAself-driving technology to deliver things like HD maps, vehicle control, automated parking, and others for the Chinese market.For some time, it looked like Baidu's self-driving goals would be based on domination in China-perhaps to gain footing in the ride-sharing business currently dominated by AppleAAPLbacked Didi Chuxing-but today's announcement implies that the internet behemoth has more global dreams.5 Trades Could Profit ""Big-League"" from Trump   PoliciesIf the stocks above spark your interest, wait until you look into companies primed to make substantial gains from Washington's changing course.Today, Zacks reveals 5 tickers that could benefit from new trends like streamlined drug approvals, tariffs, lower taxes, higher interest rates, and spending surges in defense and infrastructure.See these buy recommendations now >>Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Apart from talking about augment reality (AR), several other announcements, related to virtual reality (VR) and Messenger, were made.Facebook also announced a new program called Developer Circles, aimed at forging a strong developer community to enable better dissemination of knowledge about technologies as well as better collaboration. Next, there is the Places Graph to help users get data (names, photos, Facebook consumer ratings etc) on 140 million places across the world-like parks, public places and restaurants-to create ""location-aware experiences"". By creating such experiences, it will ""help people learn more about where they are so they can make informed decisions about where to go and what to do"", adds Facebook.However, over the last few days, Facebook has been in the limelight because of the live streaming of a murder on its platform. A septuagenarian in Cleveland, Robert Godwin Sr, was shot dead by Steven Stephens, who posted the video of the crime on Facebook Live. A massive manhunt was carried out by the police. However, the alleged killer reportedly shot himself dead two days later outside a Mc Donald's car park following a brief police chase. The news came in around the time of the CEO's keynote. Zuckerberg condemned the killing and stated, ""Our hearts go out to the family and friends of Robert Godwin Sr. We have a lot of work and we will keep doing all we can to prevent tragedies like this from happening.""Major HighlightsCamera Effects Platform:Facebook launched Camera Effects Platform that will enable users to add masks, frames and interactive filters to their photos. For the time being, the platform has two features. Frames Studio will help to create designs that can be used as profile picture frames. Meanwhile, AR studio will help in creating masks, animated frames and scripted effects and other AR technologies ""that react to movement, the environment or interactions during Live videos.""Facebook has been eyeing the AR/VR market for long. Zuckerberg said AR and VR go ""hand in hand."" The company is working on a technology called SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping) that can convert a 2D image into 3D.Facebook, Inc. PriceFacebook, Inc. Price|Facebook, Inc. QuoteAR/VR is the next big technological innovation along with artificial intelligence (AI) technology. According to a recent IDC report, global revenues of the AR/VR market are expected to grow at a CAGR of 198% from 2015-2020 to $143.3 billion by 2020. Meanwhile, global revenues of the Cognitive & AI market are expected to grow at a CAGR of 54.4% to over $46 billion by 2020. As a result, all tech behemoths including the likes of MicrosoftMSFT, Alphabet IncGOOGLand Amazon.com IncAMZNare trying to grab a share of this lucrative market.Facebook Spaces:Facebook launched its first VR app that will enable users to connect with family and friends in an interactive virtual environment. Initially, the beta version of the app will be available on Oculus Rift and Touch. Facebook said that with its help, users can create their VR avatar and customize it to make it look like them. The app will not only help to create a virtual world, but also keep users connected to reality by enabling Messenger calling. In a blog post, Facebook's head of social VR, Rachel Franklin said ""we'll add new features as we learn from your feedback and continue exploring what makes social VR experiences most meaningful."" She also added that Facebook will be bringing these features to other platforms as well. ""In the future, it will continue to transform the way people around the world stay connected with their communities and those closest to them. We can't wait to get there"", she further added.Messenger:At the last F8, Messenger was Facebook's key topic of discussion. It has added over 300 million users since then, taking the count to 1.2 billion. The company remains pretty excited as it opened the app to developers to create chatbots that would enable businesses to extend customer service and other transactions. Chatbot is the new buzzword in the tech space. Messenger now has over 10K developers and bots in its ecosystem. At the latest F8, Facebook announced the addition of a flurry of new features to the platform. These include the Discover Tab that will help users to find businesses they ""care about.""Moreover, chat extensions will facilitate multiple users to chat with the same business at a particular time. Apart from that, Messenger's AI powered voice assistant, M will now help users with suggestions to improve their communication experience on the app. For the time being, Suggestions from M will be available to users across the United States, with a global launch in the near term. M is capable of suggesting things ""when it recognizes intent in a conversation"" like suggesting stickers or paying/requesting money.  Moreover, it will help users to get a cab by giving Lyft and Uber options if the conversation is about going somewhere or suggest restaurants if the discussion is about food.At the keynote, Zuckerberg had mentioned that the team in Arizona is working on conducting the second test of its solar powered drone Aquila. For now, we look forward to day 2 when Facebook is likely to touch upon its hardware and Internet connectivity efforts.So stay tuned!!!Zacks Rank & Stock Price MovementAt present, Facebook has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Tech Roundup: QCOM Answers Apple, GOOGL Answers DoL, WDC Objects;4/18/2017;"Last week saw QualcommQCOMfiling counterclaims against AppleAAPLin their ongoing patent-related lawsuit, AlphabetGOOGLdefending itself against gender inequality allegations by the Labor Department, Western DigitalWDCobjecting to Toshiba's chip unit sale to BroadcomAVGOand much more.So let's jump to the details-Qualcomm Replies to AppleIn counterclaims filed in a California Federal court, Qualcomm has indicated that Apple is playing needlessly dirty in an attempt to keep costs down. The point of contention, as has often been in the past, is standard essential patents (SEPs), on the basis of which much of modern day telecommunications takes place.The companies that contributed technology to form the standard are required to license the technology to others on fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory (FRAND) terms. But what constitutes FRAND has been debated about a lot because companies offering this technology obviously want to be paid more, especially from companies like Apple that make super normal profits. While on the other hand, the companies that license want to point to all their other innovations built on top of the standards and argue that the standards are just a very small part of the end product and so don't deserve a good price.Qualcomm's complaints are mainly about Apple failing to engage in good faith negotiations over its 3G and 4G patents while also seeking to use both these and its 5G technology at a fraction of the cost that other smartphone vendors are apparently willing to pay. ""Now, after a decade of historic growth, Apple refuses to acknowledge the well-established and continuing value of those technologies. It has launched a global attack on Qualcomm and is attempting to use its enormous market power to coerce unfair and unreasonable license terms from Qualcomm"" reads the complaint.It also says that Apple made ""false statements"" to the Korean FTC and encouraged Samsung to go after it to force Qualcomm to change its licensing model. The KFTC investigation ultimately led to an $865 million fine on Qualcomm. Note that Apple doesn't use Qualcomm technology directly but through its manufacturing partners, which have licensing deals with Qualcomm, some going back to before Apple started using its technology.If Apple withholds payments to its partners they might hold out on payments to Qualcomm. Qualcomm may be able to get its agreements enforced in court but it leads to unnecessary and wasteful litigation on multiple levels. This is exactly what Apple is doing according to Qualcomm.Qualcomm further says that Apple ""acted to prevent Qualcomm from revealing to consumers the extent to which iPhones with Qualcomm's chipsets outperformed iPhones with Intel's chipsets"" and later falsely claimed that there was ""no discernible difference.""Google's Fight with the Labor DepartmentThe U.S. Department of Labor (DoL) has made a sweeping statement that it had ""found systemic compensation disparities against women pretty much across the entire workforce"" and DOL Regional Director Janette Wipper said the agency had received ""compelling evidence of very significant discrimination against women in the most common positions at Google headquarters.""In a detailed response to the allegation, Google's VP of people operations, Eileen Naughton said that the claims had been made ""without any supporting data or methodology."" She also explained the salary analysis system Google currently employs:""Each year, we suggest an amount for every employee's new compensation (consisting of base salary, bonus and equity) based on role, job level, job location as well as current and recent performance ratings…The analysts who calculate the suggested amounts do not have access to employees' gender data. An employee's manager has limited discretion to adjust the suggested amount, providing they cite a legitimate adjustment rationale.""The model then measures individual salary calculations against those received by their peers which is done to eliminate ""statistically significant differences between men's and women's compensation"". Naughton also said that Google's methodology is available to other businesses if they want to test their own compensation practices for equal pay.This has been going on since Sep 2016, after which a case was filed in January, asking for its compensation data. Things came to a head after Google failed to comply with a routine audit.Western Digital ObjectsToshiba is under pressure to sell its memory chip business after accounting irregularities related to its Westinghouse nuclear project put it into financial trouble. But Western Digital, which recently acquired SanDisk, is in a JV with Toshiba and has also invested billions of dollars in that business.WDC says that Toshiba didn't have the legal right to split the chip business and it also deserves prior and confidential negotiating rights in case of its sale as a result of this agreement. It also objects to a sale to Broadcom, despite it being the highest bidder because of unsavory dealings with that company. Read more:Why Suitors Are Flocking To Toshiba's Chip BusinessPC Shipment Declines Continue to ModerateAccording to research firms IDC and Gartner, PC shipments showed signs of improvement in the first quarter of 2017, with declines continuing to moderate. This was the 10thstraight quarter of PC shipment declines. Business PCs did better than consumer PCs as expected. The spoilers remain largely the same: shift to mobile devices and emerging markets, and a longer replacement cycle.

The BIS reportedly says that this phone will be different from international versions. Apple recently discounted the 4-inch phone to Rs. 19,999, which is expected to help it gain share in the mid-range market. Wistron-owned ICT Service Management Solutions, based in Yeshwantpur, Benguluru has been commissioned for the manufacturing.MKM Optimistic on Alibaba Cloud Growth: MKM analysts have issued a highly optimistic report about Alibaba'sBABAcloud business. They estimate that the business could be worth $20 billion today with the potential to grow to a $65-70 billion valuation over the next 4-5 years.The optimism is driven by data supplied by the analysts: 60K developers are working on the platform, AliCloud has 765K paying customers (up 100% year over year), it has 2.8 million total customers; after large enterprises, which use state-owned infrastructure, AliCloud is the largest private player with 70 of the largest 100 startups using its services. Also, Alibaba has been investing in the business for the past eight years, which is reportedly three years short of Amazon and four years longer than Alphabet's Google.New Technology/ProductsAMD Ryzen 5 Release: AMD started selling its Zen-based Ryzen 5 processors (four core/eight thread and six core/twelve thread) into the channel some time back and now, these products are available to consumers. The processors reportedly compare well with Intel's Kaby Lake-based i5 chips (four core/four thread) going by the considerable number of reviews comparing the two.As may be expected, Intel's chip is more expensive when you consider the fact that it has fewer threads and cores, but single-core performance is better. On a net basis, while AMD still lags Intel slightly on performance, it's packing in more compute power at lower costs that is likely to go down well with consumers. Gamers are the biggest drivers of consumer PC sales right now so both Intel and AMD have their work cut out.Microsoft Tools for Hybrid Cloud Migration: MicrosoftMSFThas come out with three new tools that in very broad terms, will help enterprises evaluate the savings generated from moving corporate workloads to Azure, the Azure Hybrid Use Benefit in the Azure Management Portal that can save them up to 40% on their Windows server licenses and Azure Site Recovery to facilitate the process of migrating virtual machines to Azure. Microsoft is en route to delivering annualized commercial cloud revenue of $20 billion by 2018 and its pace of growth indicates that the once unreal target is now within reach.Microsoft Launching Minecraft Marketplace: The Minecraft development team apparently can't keep up with the demand for customizations and levels and so it's getting on board independent developers that will supply these and other customizations through the in-game store. The good thing for developers is that Minecraft maker Mojang, now owned by Microsoft is willing to pay out 50% of what the creation generates, with 30% going to Apple, Google, or Microsoft's app stores and itself retaining the rest.Minecraft is an insanely popular title, having sold 121 million copies worldwide, with 55 million unique monthly players (figures from Microsoft). As of now, nine businesses have been approved for selling feature packs with prices ranging from $1-10 per creation. Microsoft will sell Minecraft Coins that can be used to buy items.  Microsoft intends to eventually make the purchases sync across devices and platforms.Microsoft Ends Support for Vista: Microsoft has officially withdrawn support to its unsuccessful Windows Vista launched in 2009. While some people did buy systems based on the OS, most were dissatisfied and what's more, Vista was the reason that most XP users simply refused to move on. All that is well behind us and both Windows 7 and Windows 10 have been received well. Microsoft says, Windows Vista users ""will no longer receive new security updates, non-security hotfixes, free or paid assisted support options, or online technical content updates from Microsoft."" So that ends the matter.Google Home Services, Food Delivery App for India: Google has launched an app called Aero in Bengaluru and Mumbai, India that will allow people to connect with home service providers like plumbers, electricians and the like. It will also allow users to search for nearby restaurants and schedule food delivery.M&A and CollaborationsMicrosoft, eBay, Tencent Invest in India's Flipkart: Microsoft, eBay and China's Tencent joined earlier investors Naspers Group, Tiger Global Management, Accel Partners and DST Global for a share in Flipkart, India's largest ecommerce company. The three companies together invested $1.4 billion. Ebay sold its Indian operations to Flipkart and added $500 million for its share in the company. The company is now valued at $11.6 billion.Microsoft Buys Deis: Microsoft spent an undisclosed amount of money to buy San Francisco-based software startup Deis that was reportedly acquired by Engine Yard back in 2015. The startup has developed an open source tool based on the Kubernetes container management system that Google developed and then open sourced.Microsoft initially agreed to work with Google on Kubernetes back in 2014 but also backed competing platforms Mesos and Docker Swarm. But Kubernetes has gained ground so in February, Kubernetes became available on the Azure Container service as well. The reason this is all so significant is because containerization is extremely important for information stored in the cloud since it creates a virtual box of code that can be shared and moved between applications and across clouds as needed.""At Microsoft, we've seen explosive growth in both interest and deployment of containerized workloads on Azure, and we're committed to ensuring Azure is the best place to run them,"" Scott Guthrie, EVP cloud and enterprise group at Microsoft wrote in a blog post.Google to Invest In LG Display: South Korea's Electronic Times has reported that Google has offered to pay LG Display up to $880 million (one trillion KRW) as its contribution toward a production line for flexible OLED panels for use in second-generation Pixel phones. LG is considering the offer. Google's Pixel, which has the appearance and features of a premium device and has been marketed as such, will fall back in the race with Samsung and Apple on features if it doesn't get some OLED screens of its own.So Google's needs are clear: it also doesn't need to get into a deal with Samsung, which uses OLED in its own phones and is also in an agreement to supply to Apple. So it's trying to find another supplier.Some NumbersFacebook Announces Monthly Advertisers: FacebookFBhas announced that the number of advertisers on its platform has grown from 4 million to 5 million between September and now. Businesses with mobile pages now total 65 million while businesses with Instagram profiles are up to 8 million. Among the 5 million advertisers, the biggest industries are e-commerce, entertainment/media and retail.Unsurprisingly, around 75% percent of advertisers are in its fastest-growing markets, which are India, Thailand, Brazil, Mexico and Argentina. Nearly 50% of advertisers create ads on mobile devices.Facebook Messenger Users: Facebook Messenger, which the company spun out in 2014 and then enhanced with games, a chat bot platform, voice calling, video calling, as well as a revamped camera with masks, frames, stickers and effects now has 1.2 million users. That's up from 700 million users when it was spun out and 600 million users on the hot Facebook-owned platform Instagram.Sell These Stocks.

Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Is a Long-Term Powerhouse;4/18/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe markets are an awfully confusing place, congested with a litany of diverging arguments. Especially for a beginner investor, deciding where to go is a potentially perilous experiment. But within the madhouse, a few names pop up that are seemingly above the fray. You can depend on them through good times and bad.Facebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) is easily a top contender in this category. So, what makes FB stock so special?makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockThe obvious answer is the enormous success that it has enjoyed. Since closing at $38.23 after its initial public offering, Facebook stock is now trading above $140.In fact, shares set an all time closing record on Mar. 29, at $142.65. The only time that FB stock floundered was during its maiden year of 2012, when initial investors lost 30%.That setback is of course well back in the rear-view mirror. Early concerns about FB being unable to monetize its business quickly faded due to its sheer dominance of its industry. WhatAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) aka Google is to the internet, Facebook is to social media and networking. Using the success of GOOG as a model, it's not a stretch to imagine the same thing occurring to FB stock.The measure of a company's reach is obviously determined by how well it is known to the general public. For FB, they've changed our lexicon. Not only is Facebook a verb, its ancillary terms, such as ""friending,"" are used seamlessly inpopular culture.Facebook Stock Is the Investment of TomorrowAs great as this is, the markets are ""here today, gone today."" After rising so much over the past six years, it's natural to assume that the growth potential is gone. While it's difficult to say whether Facebook stock will crank out a few triple-digit returns likeNetflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) orAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), shares offer plenty of long-term positives.The 11 Best Dividend Stocks to BuyThe future of FB stock was essentially secured back in the summer of 2015. That was when CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced that the company launched its solar-powered plane Aquila. More than just a cool science experiment, Aquila providedinternet accessto remote regions of the world.It's not so much the technology that went into this project, but rather, its implications. The social media giant has over 1.7 billion users that log onto their site on a monthly basis. That by itself is an impressive number for the company, and is more than enough reason to consider buying Facebook stock. Clearly, a majority of the subscription base comes from tech-savvy nations.Management could just be content with what they have, which is an enormous global brand. Instead, they realize that the often hegemonic influence of the west is waning. In terms of true growth potential, the key markets are Africa and Asia. Despite being the most populous continents, they rankat the bottomof internet penetration. By launching projects such as Aquila, Facebook is asserting itself as the brand of tomorrow, not just of today.That kind of smarts doesn't come around too often. If I had to pick one reason why FB stock is a long-term no-brainer, this would be it.FB Stock: A Discount Is Coming, But Don't Over-Think It!Having said that, I agree withInvestorPlace'sSerge Berger, who struck abalanced tonewith Facebook stock. In his words, we should embrace the company, not chase it.Click to EnlargeFor those that want to get the best deal, Mr. Berger's advice is quite timely.FB stock is on a roll but typically in the markets, momentum isn't a one-way street. For January, shares returned 11.5%, while the benchmarkSPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust(NYSEARCA:SPY) was flat. Beyond that, February picked up nearly 2%, while March ended up with over 3% returns.United Continental Holdings Inc (UAL) Stock Is Good ... For Dividends?Essentially, Facebook stock hasn't had a genuine correction since November of last year. You'd figure at some point, things will slow down a bit. We're already seeing the first possible signs of that, with FB stock going nowhere so far this month. Don't be surprised to see further modest downside before things start picking back up.And pick up it will. While everybody aspires to get the best price, there's a risk in over-thinking the opportunity in Facebook stock. I'd hate to see someone save nickels to lose dollars.The bottom line for FB is that its leadership is one of the most innovative, forward-thinking teams ever assembled. They still have their focus on the day-to-day, which is why the stock is where it is right now. But they're making sure that they're relevant for future generations. As a steady rock in your portfolio, you couldn't ask for more.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 Hopeless Stocks to Wash From Your Portfolio Forever7 Top Emerging Markets Stocks to Buy NowBank of America Corp (BAC) Stock Is a Screaming Buy After Q1 EarningsThe postFacebook Inc (FB) Stock Is a Long-Term Powerhouseappeared first onInvestorPlace."

After Netflix's Mixed Q1 Earnings, Should You Sell Your FANG Stocks?;4/18/2017;"After a mixed first-quarter earnings release Monday, shares of Netflix fell more than 1.85% in early morning trading on Tuesday. Despite solid revenue growth, investors were unimpressed with several other key figures from the report, which has cast a cloud of uncertainty over the tech sector-especially the notorious ""FANG"" stocks-and left many wondering what exactly the market wants this earnings season.FANG, an acronym coined by CNBC's Jim Cramer several years ago, refers to FacebookFB, AmazonAMZN, NetflixNFLX, and GoogleGOOGL. Each of these companies are primarily focused on tech or internet services, and they all own a solid share of the market in their respective industries.These stocks have traditionally been appealing because of their promises to deliver aggressive growth in their own key areas, but Netflix's latest earnings report underscores the recent shift in focus throughout the FANG group, calling each individual stock into question this earnings season.What Netflix's Q1 Earnings Shows UsFor the first quarter, Netflix reported earnings of 40 cents per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 38 cents per share and marked year-over-year growth of over 560%. Netflix's quarterly revenue of $2.637 billion narrowly missed our consensus estimate of $2.641 billion, but it also displayed aggressive growth, gaining about 35% from the year-ago quarter (also read:Netflix Posts Earnings Beat, Stock Dips on Weak Guidance).The investors that are selling Netflix in the wake of its report seem to be focused on the company's slightly disappointing subscriber growth figures. The streaming service reached 98.75 million total members in the quarter, with 94.36 of those being paid, non-trial memberships. This fell just short of the 99 million members that the company guided for in its previous report.For years, Netflix has traded on this subscriber growth figure, but with its international expansion completed over a year ago, a focus on membership adds seems a bit outdated. Netflix thinks this too.""For the last several years we've had flat operating margins due to established markets funding international expansion with every spare dollar we had… the major indicators of our progress were member and revenue growth and US contribution margins,"" the company said in its shareholderletter. ""Starting this year, we can be primarily measured by revenue growth and (global) operating margins as our primary metrics.""Netflix's key metric is no longer what it used to be, and this idea becomes a pattern when we look at the other FANG stocks.Take Facebook, for example. In February, shares of Facebook dipped slightly after its fourth-quarter report, despite the fact that the company beat our consensus earnings and revenue estimates. Why? Because investors wanted more of the aggressive-growth Facebook that they had grown accustom to (also read:Why Facebook Stock Slumped Despite Solid Earnings Report).In reality, Facebook warned investors that this year would be one of heavy investments into its future and significantly slowed year-over-year growth. While this could mean a short-term hit to earnings, Facebook longs should be rejoicing that the company has realized it needs to work on the next big growth opportunity right now. That may take years to pay off, but Mark Zuckerberg and company have a history of being right.For Amazon, the story is similar. We once focused on the growth of its e-commerce business and questioned its ability to dominate traditional retailers. Now Amazon has all but killed old-school retail, and investors are more concerned with the growth of Amazon Web Services and Amazon's media investments.Google has a similar story. Heck, Google isn't even Google anymore. Alphabet Inc., the new-ish parent company of Google, has its hands in just about every emerging tech market. Why? Because Google's traditional advertising business is slowly fading. The company is focusing on new growth opportunities.Bottom LineAs we look ahead to the upcoming earnings announcements from Facebook, Amazon, and Alphabet, don't make the same mistake that some Netflix investors have today. These aren't your daddy's FANG stocks, and that means you shouldn't be focused be on all the old key metrics.With that said, remember to look at these stocks individually, and study the latest trends in earnings estimates and estimate revisions before making a play on any of them.Sell These Stocks.

Here's How Apple Can Reach a $1 Trillion Valuation;4/18/2017;"""I sold my stock in Apple back in 1995. If I would have held it longer, I would have been a millionaire!,"" exclaims that one guy that we all totally know.While that guy tends to talk about ""what could have been"" a little too frequently to be taken seriously, he does have a point here. After decades of consistent growth, interrupted by just a few down periods, AppleAAPLis the world's most-valuable publicly-traded company with a market capitalization of nearly $750 million.Perhaps no company has burned its imagery into the minds of the public better than this technology behemoth. The Cupertino, California-based firm is more than just a brand-it's an influencer of culture. As Apple goes, so do the masses. Its logo is iconic; its products are timeless.And investors still want more.So how can Apple, with its well-established product lines and billions of existing customers, break into uncharted territory? How does the one on top climb higher? How does the biggest get even bigger?The short answer: by trying something new.Old Dog, New TricksOut of the many new options that Apple has to test out, it seems like the company is taking self-driving cars the most seriously. Last Friday, the iPhone maker received a permit to begin testing self-driving cars in California, and it looks like Apple's formerly top-secret autonomous vehicle project is finally ready to take the next step (also read:Apple Gets Self-Driving Car Permit: What's at Stake for the Industry?).However, we are still-at the very least-several years away from an ""iCar,"" and Apple is likely to meet stiff competition from its industry competitors in this field.On top of the big-name automakers like TeslaTSLA, General MotorsGM, FordF, and many others working on self-driving cars, tech companies like Alphabet Inc.GOOGLand IntelINTCare also working on their own autonomous vehicle projects (also read:Intel Buys Mobileye: Are More Driverless Car Deals in the Future?).The self-driving car space is sure to be crowded, but a brand like Apple won't have to worry about name recognition, and if the company's previous products are any evidence, Apple's car project will likely result in a sleek, user-friendly, and high-performing vehicle.Becoming a major player in what could be a world-changing industry, especially one that is still at its infancy like this one, would certainly help Apple gain even more value. Of course, that's far from the only thing the Tim Cook-led company can do to bring its market cap over $1 trillion.If the internet-and its vast array of unfounded rumors-were left to decide how Apple can grow, it would want the tech giant to enter the world of media production… by buying DisneyDIS.Yes, the age-old ""Apple should buy Disney"" conjecture is alive and well, despite no real evidence pointing towards any merger talks between the two companies.And while it may be pure fiction, an Apple-Disney merger does speak to something that is currently missing from Apple's portfolio of products and projects. For all of the snazzy devices that the company makes, it owns very little of what its customers access on those devices.Sure, Apple Music has growninsanely fast, but Apple has notably not yet entered the world of video streaming or original programming. The Apple TV device is a strong candidate for any cord-cutter, and an Apple-owned over-the-top streaming service has been rumored for years, but buying a media company would immediately bolster Apple's arsenal if it does want to seriously contend in this space at some point.Bottom LineThe goal of a publicly-traded company is not to reach new market-cap milestones, break records, or make headlines. In fact, it is quite a bit simpler than that. All public companies, big or small, need to provide value to their shareholders.This means that reaching a $1 trillion valuation is likely not an explicit goal for Apple right now. Instead, Tim Cook and company are probably plotting on how to effectively deliver the next must-have product, while also continuing to pump out the Apple products we all know and love.These goals are, of course, intended to help the company grow and provide that desired value for its shareholders.But an Apple that's worth $1 trillion is not that far away, and the company has several obvious new routes it can take if it wants to add the nearly $250 million in market cap needed to reach the milestone.Only time will reveal how Apple intends on continuing its ridiculous growth, but in the meantime, we can continue to speculate. Will Apple become a self-driving car giant, or will it purchase a media company and take the entertainment business by storm? I can't wait to find out.Sell These Stocks.

3 Reasons That Tesla (TSLA) Will Be the Most Valuable Automaker Again;4/18/2017;"Last week, Tesla Inc.TSLAbrieflybecame America's most valuable car company by market cap. While General Motors (GM) regained its throne shortly after, the Silicon Valley-based automaker is not looking to back down from the fight.Here's why Tesla is going to be the country's most valuable car company again:Price IncentivesElectrekreported that Tesla hasdiscontinuedthe cheapest version of its Model S sedan and lowered the price of the following variant the 75 kWh Model S, by $7,500 to $69,500.The price slashes ""makes sense,"" according toThe Motley Fool.As Tesla's Model 3, the cost-efficient electric car, is set to launch in July, it could compete in sales with the Model S. By lowering the price, the owners who prefer an upgrade or a more spacious car might have a greater incentive to purchase a Model S.ChinaThe price drop is not only good for electric car buyers here in America but also to customers in Asia. As many countries in Asia continue to shift their focus to greener policies, citizens and corporations are looking at the electric car for alternative transportation to avoid air pollution.Not only is China theworld's largest auto market, with 23.6 million cars sold in 2016, it is also thelargest market for electric cars. According toEv-Volumes, China saw 85% growth in electric car sales from 2015 to 2016.China has demonstrated its commitment to reducing CO2 emissions and building a market for electric vehicles. The country looks to create a $1.3 billion market, as it announced in February that Beijing's taxi fleet of 70,000 vehicles will be switched over to an all-electric fleet, according to a report byNational Business Daily.Before shaking up the taxi fleet, Chinese citizens have been buying electric cars. Tesla reported that its sales in China tripled in 2016 compared to 2015, bringing in over $1 billion in revenues.Self-Driving CarsAlphabet'sGOOGLGoogle or Uber aren't the only tech companies building an autonomous car.China's tech giant, TencentTCEHYis also one of the leaders in developing self-driving car technology.Reutersreported back in July 2016 that Tencent backed a Chinese automotive venture, Future Mobility, which aims to launch an electric self-driving car before 2020.Furthermore, Elon Musk, Tesla's CEO,pledgedto make a car that can drive from Los Angeles to New York City with no human control by the end of 2017. Teslareleased a videoof its Model X SUV driving itself around Palo Alto last year.Though it is plausible that Musk will not meet his own deadline, Tencent seems to have faith.  The Chinese Internet leader recently purchased $1.8 billion worth of Tesla shares.These investments by Tencent not only show the company's belief in the market for the self-driving car, but it also hints at Tesla's possible foothold in the Chinese auto market. With market cap of over $280 billion, Tencent offers more than just financial backing, but also strong political connections.Bottom LineTesla's recent decision to lower prices might just be a short-term strategy to keep investors confident while it works to explore China's market and develop a self-driving car. Either way, these choices are smart. It's clear that Tesla still has several key markets to break into, and that means it will surely regain the top spot eventually.makeArticleAd();Sell These Stocks.

Google's New Chip May Be the Future of AI Systems;4/18/2017;"Alphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) Google announced at its I/O   Developers Conference in May 2016 that it had designed a new   chip, called the tensor processing unit (TPU), specifically   designed for the demands of training artificial intelligence (AI)   systems. The company didn't divulge much at the time,   but in ablog postthat same week, hardware engineer Norm Jouppi revealed that   Google had been running the TPU in the company's data centers for   more than a year and ""found them to deliver an order of magnitude   better-optimized performance per watt for machine learning. This   is roughly equivalent to fast-forwarding technology about seven   years into the future (three generations of Moore's Law).""The chip was an application-specific integrated circuit   (ASIC), a microchip designed for a specific application. Little   else was known about the enigmatic TPU and the mystery continued   until last week, when Google pulled back the curtain to reveal   the inner workings of this new groundbreaking advancement for   AI.Google's tensor processing unit could revolutionize AI     processing. Image source: Google.makeArticleAd();Speed and efficiencyThe TPU underlies TensorFlow, Google's open-source machine   learning framework, a collection of algorithms that power the   company's deep neural networks. These AI systems are capable of   teaching themselves by processing large amounts of data. Google   tailored the TPU to meet the unique demands of training its AI   systems, which had previously been run primarily on graphics   processing units (GPUs) manufactured byNVIDIA Corporation(NASDAQ: NVDA) . While the company currently runs the TPU and GPU   side by side (for now), this could have drastic implications for   how AI systems are trained going forward.Google released a study -- authored by more than 70   contributors -- that provided a detailed analysis of the   TPU. In ablog postearlier this month, Jouppi laid out the capabilities of the chip.   He described how it processed AI production workloads 15 to 30   times faster than CPUs and GPUs performing the same task, and   achieved a 30 to 80 times improvement in energy efficiency.Saved the cost of 12 new data centersGoogle realized several years ago that if customers were to   use Google voice search for just three minutes each day, that   would require the company to double its existing number of data   centers. The company also credits the TPU with providing faster   response times for search, acting as the linchpin for   improvements in Google Translate, and was a key factor in its AI   system's defeat of a world champion in the ancient Chinesegame of Go.Companies are taking a variety of approaches to bring   improvements to AI systems.Intel Corporation's(NASDAQ: INTC) recently acquired start-up Nervana has developed   its own ASIC, the Nervana Engine, that eliminates components from   the GPU not essential to the functions necessary for AI. The   company also re-engineered the memory and believed it could   realize 10 times the processing currently performed by   GPUs. Intel isworking to integratethis capability on its existing processor platforms to better   compete with NVIDIA's offering.Not the only game in townA field-programmable gate array (FPGA) processor can be   reprogrammed after installation and is another chip being   leveraged for gains in AI. FPGAs have increasingly been used in   data centers to accelerate machine learning.Apple Inc.(NASDAQ: AAPL) is widely believed to haveinstalled this chipin its iPhone 7 to promote sophisticated AI advances locally on   each phone. The company has emphasized not sacrificing user   privacy to make advances in AI, so this would be a logical move   for its smartphones.NVIDIA Tesla P100 powers Facebook's AI server. Image source:     NVIDIA.Facebook, Inc.(NASDAQ: FB) has taken adifferent approachin optimizing its recently released data center server named Big   Basin. The company created a platform that utilizes eight NVIDIA   Tesla P100 GPU accelerators attached with NVLink connectors   designed to reduce bottlenecks, in what it described as ""the most   advanced data center GPU ever built."" The company revealed that   this latest server is capable of training 30% larger machine   learning data systems in about half the time. Facebook also   indicated that the architecture was based NVIDIA's DGX-1 ""AI   supercomputer in a box.""Much more innovation to comeThough we have been hearing about almost daily breakthroughs   in AI, it is important to remember that the science is still in   its infancy and new developments will likely continue at a rapid   pace. These advances provide for more efficient systems and lay   the foundation for future progress in the field. These necessary   advances will propel future innovation, but are difficult to   quantify in terms of dollars and cents, as well as the potential   effects on future revenue and profitability.10 stocks we like better than Alphabet (A   shares)When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights: Broadcom, Western Digital, Apple, Alphabet and Amazon;4/18/2017;"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL - April 18, 2017 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog includeBroadcom(NASDAQ:AVGO-Free Report),Western Digital(NASDAQ:WDC-Free Report),Apple(NASDAQ:AAPL-Free Report),Alphabet(NASDAQ:GOOGL-Free Report) andAmazon(NASDAQ:AMZN-Free Report).Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations.Get #1Stock of the Day pick for free.Here are highlights from Monday's Analyst Blog:Why Suitors Are Flocking to Toshiba's Chip BusinessToshiba has been in trouble since the surfacing of accounting irregularities in its Westinghouse nuclear business that included cost overruns on nuclear construction projects as well as overstatement of profit from the years 2008 through 2014. The company expects to report an annual loss of $9 billion this year due to write-downs related to Westinghouse and has given a warning that it may not be able to continue as a going concern as a result. This ultimately also led to tensions with auditors PriceWaterhouseCoopers.But not all of this 142-year old electronics conglomerate is mired in losses; one section that is doing rather well is the flash memory chip business, where it has a JV with SanDisk (now Western Digital). So Toshiba needs to sell this business and install proper internal controls, which if unsatisfactory, will lead to its de-listing. Which is why it has put this business on auction.While the front runners in the bidding process are Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO-Free Report) and private equity firm Silver Lake Partners, Taiwan's Foxconn (Honhai Precision Industry), South Korean chipmaker SK Hynix, and Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC-Free Report) itself, some news reports indicate that Softbank, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL-Free Report), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL-Free Report) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN-Free Report) may also be interested.Of these, Broadcom's first round offer of 2.5 trillion yen ($23 billion) and Foxconn's 2 trillion yen are the highest bids. Hynix's bid is unknown as is Western Digital's, but WDC has said that analysts estimate the fair value to be around 1.5 trillion yen.Why the Excitement?Toshiba is the second largest NAND flash memory maker, a technology that is increasingly taking over mobile devices and finding application in the cloud. The advantage of flash memory is in its speed and reliability, while the regular hard drive storage is cheaper but shorter-lived. As the cost of flash drives falls over time, it will be used more broadly and will replace or at least supplement hard drive storage.Since most tech players mentioned in the previous section either sell memory or buy it, they would gain leverage from acquiring the technology. Those that sell can augment their current offerings while those that buy will have another way to consolidate their supply chain and thus lower costs while also gaining technological advantage.What Could Be the ResultThe deal will have a political angle to it, since the Japanese government is unlikely to approve a sale to investors that might bring risk to national security. Because of its links to China, a sale to Foxconn will likely not be approved by the government, even if Japanese banks agree to partner with it to finance the deal. So Hynix is better placed to win.On the other hand, the government will be quicker to approve the deal if the unit stays between Japanese and American owners. Since Western Digital has issues with Broadcom, and it will most likely have a say (given its $13 billion investment in the JV over several years and current agreement with Toshiba), Broadcom may not be able to bid successfully in this case. But Western Digital won't be able to buy out the unit unless it gets itself some partners (the company may not be able to dish out more cash so soon after SanDisk).That leaves combinations of American and Japanese players, which may include Apple and Softbank. Apple will prefer that Foxconn gets a stake because it is its major supplier. So Toshiba may successfully sell a portion of the business to the Apple-Foxconn combination or Apple-Softbank-Foxconn combination or a combination that includes Softbank and other players.The Best & Worst of ZacksToday you are invited to download the full, up-to-the-minute list of 220 Zacks Rank #1 ""Strong Buys"" free of charge.

The stock responds strongly to quarterly earnings reports and has been weak following the last two reports, so expectations are modest ahead of the April 27th earnings release. The company is expected to earn $7.24 per share on $19.7 billion in revenues, up +20.3% and +19.3% from the year-earlier period, respectively. The Zacks analyst points out the company's good execution to date, more or less maintaining its dominant share in the competitive, fast-growing search market. The company's focus on innovation, strategic acquisitions and Android OS should continue to generate strong cash flows. However, the promise of Google's non-search businesses continue getting pushed into future even as the company's spending keeps rising. (You canread the full research report on Alphabet here     >>>)Amgenshares struggled last year, but came back strong following the election as fears of restrictive pricing and regulatory strictures eased. The stock has been down in a big way since March 1st, but has still done better than the peer group over the past year. The Zacks analyst points out that Amgen remains well positioned for growth with several blockbuster drugs in its portfolio. Amgen's growth products - Prolia, Xgeva, Vectibix, Nplate and Sensipar - are all performing well. Additionally, Amgen's restructuring plan should make it leaner and more cost efficient. Estimates have declined lately ahead of the company's Q1 earnings release. The company has a positive record of earnings surprises in the recent quarters.

An improving jobs picture, gradual recovery in the housing market and merchandising initiatives along with efforts to provide better omni-channel customer experience bode well for Lowe's. It also remains well positioned to reap the benefits of strategic acquisitions done earlier. Better-than-expected results in the final quarter of 2016 prompted management to provide an encouraging outlook for fiscal 2017.

Go Long Netflix, Inc. (NFLX) Stock for Free;4/18/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsI have been outspoken againstNetflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX) outlook in the face of gigantic competition fromAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) andAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL). Despite that, I have consistently traded Netflix stock long behind the faith that Wall Street has for the stock.makeArticleAd();Source:Vivian D Nguyen via Flickr (Modified)That isn't changing in the wake ofNetflix's first-quarter earnings report.In trading, it's important to set feelings aside and traded the price action. Late January, in spite of my own bearish opinion of its outlook, I shared a bullish NFLX trade thatcreated income out of thin air. Today, following earnings, I'm looking to repeat that performance … but I'm by no means blessing its fundamentals, which still look as mix after its Q1 report as they ever have.Instead, we'll sell risk below support levels and let time do the rest.Netflix's critics point to the fundamentals from the bottom-line perspective. But when evaluating growth companies, experts should look for growth. Netflix has tremendous global growth potential - even its ""miss"" on Q1 international subscribers represented outstanding growth, and the company atoned by guiding Q2 better than the Street's expectations. So for the short-term, this thesis stands undeniable.Bank of America Corp (BAC) Stock Is a Screaming Buy After Q1 EarningsThus, NFLX gets a pass on all else as long as growth doesn't slow.Click to EnlargeTechnically, Netflix stock has the potential to fuel much higher levels in spite of many haters. So I trade the tape - I don't fight it. To me, this means that I get to rinse and repeat my previous trade, only on a different time frame.How to Trade NFLX Stock HereThe bullish bet:Sell the Dec $110 naked put for $3.50 per contract. This trade has an 80% theoretical chance of success. I need Netflix shares to stay above my sold strike or risk being put the stock.

Will Virtual Assistants Revolutionize Home Automation?;4/18/2017;"Almost everyone with a smartphone is familiar with some of the   capabilities of voice-controlled virtual assistants. Siri fromApple Inc.(NASDAQ: AAPL) was the first out of the gate and may be the most   well known. Google Assistant fromAlphabet, Inc.(NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) is the search giant's latest   version of Google Now.Amazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ: AMZN) gave us Alexa, though she is mostly limited to   home speakers.Until the release of these virtual helpers, home automation   was primarily the dominion of expensive professionally installed   systems that controlled everything, or managed services that   provided monthly monitoring of things like alarm systems. Both   are still available, but the revolution in the smart-home market   is playing out in the individual components and smart devices   that homeowners can purchase and control with these ubiquitous   virtual assistants.One thing to be aware of: Each virtual assistant has   advantages and drawbacks, with no clear winner -- yet.makeArticleAd();Virtual assistants will drive smart-home adoption. Image     source: Getty images.Apple HomeKitSiri is the backbone for Apple's HomeKit, the smartphone app   that can be used to control a variety of smart-home products.   This platform provides a variety of helpful features to simplify   the process of adding devices and labeling ""Favorites."" You   can also organize the various components by ""Rooms"" and create   ""Scenes"" that will control multiple devices with one command.Another feature is that you can automate certain functions to   occur at a specific time of day, or when you leave home. The best   feature of HomeKit, in typical Apple fashion, is its ease of   operation -- and it can be controlled by the app, or using voice   control.A key point is that HomeKit-compatible devices have been   reviewed and vetted by Apple, providing end-to-end security. This   limits the number of available devices, but will likely prevent   you from being hacked. On the downside, Apple lacks a home   speaker system.Amazon Alexa and EchoAmazon's Alexa powers the Echo, Echo Dot, and Tap smart-home   speakers, but lacks a dedicated smartphone app. Amazon has   integrated access to Alexa via its Amazon shopping app on the   iPhone by tapping the microphone button in the app. Alexa's   advantage is in the number of things she can do -- she accepts   over 10,000 commands, called ""skills,"" though they require   remembering the very specific wording of each command.These skills address a variety of areas, not just the smart   home, though the system integrates with dozens of smart-home   devices that work directly with Alexa, and hundreds that operate   using a variety of manufacturer-specific apps. Integrating many   of these products requires a special If This Then That (IFTTT)   device to connect them and to set up routines to control multiple   components with a single command. There's also no independent   verification regarding device security.Smart homes powered by virtual assistants. Image source:     Pixabay.Google Home and Home ControlGoogle recently introduced Home, a smart-home speaker similar   to Amazon's Echo. It's powered by a Google Assistant, though not   the same Assistant that operates on Google's Android phones or   the Allo messaging app -- and they aren't integrated as of this   writing.The Assistant on Home works with components from four   smart-home partners currently (Nest, Philips Hue, IFTTT, and   SmartThings) -- far fewer than Alexa. Google plans to add   additional partners over time, though those currently available   cover the most used home-automation components.Integrating multiple smart-home products through Home requires   an IFTTT device to connect them to each other and set up   routines, similar to Alexa. Also similar to Alexa, there's no   independent verification of device security, which varies by   manufacturer. Home has Google search at its heart, so it   understands detailed questions and requests rather than the   specific skills commands required by Alexa.Some consumers will be drawn to Echo or Home by the novelty   factor, or for the variety of other capabilities, and adding   smart-home products will be an unintended result of   ownership.Something for investorsEach system has advantages and downfalls regarding its   home-automation capabilities. No one has yet developed a ""killer   app."" At this point, smart-home products seem to represent more   of a hobby than something designed to produce significant revenue   growth for any of these companies. However, the team of Alexa and   Echo has an advantage for Amazon not available to Apple or   Google.A recent analyst note by Jim Shaughnessy and Mark Mahaney of   RBC Capital Markets reported that 17% of current users of the   Echo family of products placed orders to Amazon.com with their   devices, which could result in additional sales of $10 billion in   both products and devices annually by 2020.While the hardware war is being waged, Amazon might enjoy a   nice little boost on the e-commerce side.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Apple Eyes Autonomous Car Market, Gets Permit for Test Drive;4/17/2017;"As per the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMW) in the state of California,Apple IncAAPLhas secured a permit to test self-driving vehicles. The permit is for test driving three vehicles (2015 Lexus RX450h models) with two drivers each, adds DMW.For long, there has been tremendous speculation about Apple's autonomous car technology development efforts, which is apparently codenamed, Project Titan. As usual, Apple has refrained from commenting on the matter so far. Apple loves to maintain secrecy regarding projects it's working on. Per media reports, on being asked about the permit, the company pointed to the Apple's director of product integrity, Steve Kenner's letter to NHTSA, written in November last year. In the letter, Kenner said ""The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation.""Self Driving Car Race Heats UpSelf driving technology has gained immense importance in the past few years with tech and auto behemoths like Apple, AlphabetGOOGL, FordF, Tesla IncTSLA, Volkswagen AG, Daimler AG, Uber and Lyft directing resources to develop this technology.Apple Inc.

Why Facebook's Payments Strategy Isn't About Payments;4/17/2017;"ByKaren Webster:If you want to know how and where a company will strategically spend its time, money and efforts, then look no further than how itmakesits money. So, tomorrow whenFacebook's (FB) Developer Conference, dubbedF8, kicks off, don't be surprised if payments isn't the star of the show.Except for when …For that, you'll have to read on. I've read that cliffhangers that build slowly are all the rage now.makeArticleAd();Named after Facebook'sinfamous dusk-to-dawn, eight-hour Hackathons, F8 is an annual confab intended to give developers a look at new tools that will help them reach and engage the 1.9 billion and 1.2 billion unique people who now visit Facebook every month and every day, respectively.Over those two days, it seems a near certainty that those developers will hear more about the things thatMark Zuckerberglaid out in his F8 keynote last year: how to make video more plentiful and engaging, how to use AI to make user experiences more meaningful and personalized, how to use AR/VR to create new user experiences and what Facebook is doing to give the 4 billion people in the world who don't have internet access today the chance to get it inexpensively.All things intended to support Facebook'score missionof ""giving people the power to share and remain open and connected.""Those people also include advertisers - and giving that group of people the ability to share their messages supports another core Facebook mission: generating a return for their shareholders. Those are the people who generate Facebook's revenue. So that will make the star(s) of the show tomorrow those things that Facebook can do to tie those people ever closer to its ecosystem - without alienating the users whospend nearly an hour every dayscrolling through their news feed and whose eyeballs they monetize.From Social Network to Advertising NetworkFacebook may still be described by its users as a social network, but it's far from that - 13 years after it was launched and five years since it went public. Facebook is a gigantic advertising platform, the second largest in the world behind Google (GOOG) (GOOGL). Facebook'stotal 2016 revenue, at $27.6 billion, was almost entirely the result of selling ads to brands that wanted to get their message in front of its massive and highly engaged user base. (By way of comparison, Google's ad revenue was $79 billion in 2016.)Payments accounted for a relatively paltry $753 million in revenue by comparison, down from the $849 million the year before. The decline of 11 percent year over year didn't exactly blow much of a hole in Facebook's bottom line or dampen investor interest.What would - and has in years past - is falling short on Facebook's ability to feed the ad beast. When Facebook announced that it was dangerously close to running out of ad inventory on its platform last fall, its share price dropped sharply. That's because the market rightfully pegs Facebook's biggest adversary as Google and its competitive playing field as advertising.Not payments.That didn't stop everyone - and maybe even Facebook at one point - from thinking that Facebook wanted to be a payments platform. Once upon a time and back when ""FarmVille"" and""CityVille"" were the rage, payments drove an interesting revenue stream for Facebook. Millions of people buying chickens and cherry trees for their FarmVille farms, in turn, sparked a payments ambition - remember Facebook credits? But once gaming moved to apps, Facebook lost those eyeballs and that revenue stream and, appropriately, any interest in creating a new form of currency for the Facebook platform.Its vision of turning Facebook into a giant shopping mall where people would shop and pay on the Facebook platform never materialized either. Remember Payvment and the social commerce movement? The notion that brands could launch Facebook storefronts and turn hundreds of millions of Facebook fans into buyers flopped, too. Consumers didn't want to shop on their social network, and those storefront operators - even those with tens of thousands of fans - found that unless they bought ads that directed people to those storefronts, Facebook's news feed algorithms made conversions abysmal and the ROI unappealing. Even selling gift cards on Facebook fizzled.But if one needed any further proof that ""getting into"" and monetizing payments inside of Facebook was an experiment that has long outlived its strategic purpose, one need to look no further than Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg's response to an analyst question about buy buttons duringFebruary's Q4 2016 earnings call.""The core of our focus is still very much focused on ads and how we can do ads at the product level,"" was her answer.A strategy that means that Facebook has moved away from thinking of itself as the place where commerce happens and payment is monetizedinsideof its ecosystem - but as an ecosystem that builds contextual and targeted ad-driven experiences that engage its users and direct them off Facebook to the brand's website to buy.Because advertising - and not payments - is how Facebook makes it money. And their own website is where brands want their users to conduct business.Facebook and Its Massive Ad EngineIt makes perfect sense.Platforms - the ones that scale and survive - figure out ways to build and monetize their platform assets. Facebook's assets are its users, the data they share about themselves and the time that they spend soaking up content in their news feeds.Facebook, therefore, knows a lot about its users - and that knowledge is highly monetizable as their ~$20 ARPU suggests. Facebook keeps track of every post their users like, every group they belong to, every update they make to their favorites, every change in their status, every comment they make and about what or who, places they tag and people with whom they are tagged.Facebook enriches that data set - which is already pretty valuable - with information from data aggregators. Data on users' income, marital status, loans, mortgages, credit cards, how much their house is worth, where they were born, where they went to school, how many kids they have and their ages, what kind of car they drive, where they work and the town in which they live (and much more) is mashed up with information Facebook gets from sites that its users visit that have the Facebook sharing button and what those users are looking at and clicking on. Facebook can then offer advertisers more than 1,300 attributes to reach a very relevant set of eyeballs.In the Belly of the Facebook Ad BeastOver the past several years, Facebook has innovated on how those brands can grab their targeted user's attention.Dynamic adson Facebook allow brands to present a carousel of their products from their product catalogue inside a user's news feed. Facebook's newly launched travelCityGuidesgive users information on what's happening in cities like Boston and allow them to book hotel rooms and make other travel arrangements. Facebook reports that for brands using these dynamic formats, recall increases 20 percent and awareness by as much 11 percent.Facebook's Canvas product turns product ads into app-like experiences and gives advertisers new ways to showcase them.Western Unionreported a 13 percent increase in brand recall and affinity and a 7 percent increase in purchase intent when such a campaign targets Hispanic consumers.Shopping on Instagramoffers brands a way to engage with users and show them new and/or curated products. Launched last fall as a trial, last month, that trial was expanded from its 20 pilot set of brands to many more brands. Kate Spade said that their customers loved the ability to seamlessly move from information to inspiration to purchase -one pilot retailerreported a 33 percent lift in conversions.And in every case - via dynamic ads or Canvas or Shopping on Facebook - those conversions and sales lifts were measured by users who clicked through those ad experiences and off Facebook to the brand's own websites to complete the purchase.What's NextThe opportunity for brands to engage with Facebook will expand as soon as Facebook expands the reach of its ad exchange - the Facebook Audience Network, or FAN - beyond Facebook and innovates the formats in which brands can promote their products and services on its platform.Last month, Facebook announced its partnership with Amazon (AMZN) to take FAN off Facebook by leveraging Amazon's header-bidding system to expand its inventory off Facebook. That partnership will help Facebook compete more effectively in the display ad business and give its brands the chance to be featured in those ads. It's also a pretty big shot across Google's bow, who's now the de facto king of the header bidding business.Video is another area of growth for Facebook - and another direct hit to Google's YouTube. Facebook has said that it will focus its efforts, at least right now, on the 90-second spots that include advertising after 20 seconds has been watched. Those ads also will allow consumers to punch out to brand websites to make a buy. Video ads were cited as a success story in Facebook's Q4 earnings call, as driving double-digit increases in brand recall and brand awareness for the launch of Hershey's Cookie Layer Crunch and Nielsen data reported and a 3.5 percent lift in sales for Motorola when used in support of a new product launch.Now, here's where the crescendo starts to build.More than 90 percent of Facebook's users access it via mobile devices that direct those users to a mobile website. And we all know what happens when users end up on merchant sites via their mobile devices to make a purchase.Checkout fail, a large number of times.And that failure to convert a click to a sale is one of the reasons why Facebook ad rates are so low.Payments and payments innovators can help.What should be clear is that Facebook's interest isn't to payment-enable Facebook and commerce inside of its ecosystems, because payments isn't how Facebook makes its money.But it could make more of it if it found a way to streamline the checkout process once users clicked off a product page and onto the website of the brand.And that's where payments and the payments ecosystem can help - and the opportunity for the payments ecosystems as gigantic as the advertising opportunity that Facebook is enabling on its platform. Optimizing the payments experience for the brands that Facebook users interact with will help Facebook create even more value for the brands that turn to them to generate their leads. It also will increase the value of the Facebook advertising platform by more closely correlating clicks to sales - and giving Facebook the ammo it needs to increase the rates that it charges advertisers.And from what ourCheckout Conversion Indexreflects, there's a lot of work to be done by the brands to make their checkout process smoother.Facebook has proven that it can lead the horse to water. Now it's up to the payments ecosystem to get it to drink.But What about Chatbots and Group Payments?Yes, Facebook made news a few weeks ago when it launched group payments, and a year ago when it launched chatbots and payment-enabled them inside of Messenger.Here's my take on both.Messenger has enabled P2P payments since July 2015 and that wasn't about payments either. P2P payments are free to users and so are group payments - not exactly a monetization opportunity. But what is: creating a network inside of Messenger that would make Messenger more valuable to advertisers.Messenger is now starting to testads inside of Messenger.Chatbots, well, I think you know where I stand on those.Yes, there are tens of thousands of them, and yes, some 30,000 of them are also payment-enabled. And no, not a whole lot of payments activity is happening inside of them, because, even by David Marcus' admission, they are overhyped and they underdeliver.I'll spare you my ""Poncho the Weather Cat"" story.Chatbots though,TechCrunch reported, also will make their debut at F8 (mostly, they say) as a way to keep groups informed of such mission-critical information like whetherDustin Pedoria'shit was a home run recently. Chatbots, in my book, still have a long, long way to go - and like with anything else, are up against some stiff competition with a running head start - and where time and consumer patience in putting up with the not-so-intelligent chatbots inside of Messenger could quickly turn the tide against them.I'm thinking here about voice-activated ecosystems and Amazon's Alexa - but that's another column for another Monday.But, hey, even Facebook needs its moonshots - it bought Oculus Rift, didn't it?See alsoConocoPhillips, Alaskan Oil, And Growing U.S. Oil Reserveson seekingalpha.com"

Top Research Reports for Alphabet, Amgen & Lowe's;4/17/2017;"makeZacksArticleAd();Monday April 17, 2017Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Alphabet (GOOGL), Amgen (AMGN), and Lowe's (LOW).Alphabetshares led the Zacks Tech sector at the start of the year, but have lagged since the weaker than expected quarterly report on January 26th (the stock is up +7.9% in the year-to-date period vs. +7.1% for the Tech sector). The stock responds strongly to quarterly earnings reports and has been weak following the last two reports, so expectations are modest ahead of the April 27th earnings release. The company is expected to earn $7.24 per share on $19.7 billion in revenues, up +20.3% and +19.3% from the year-earlier period, respectively. The Zacks analyst points out the company's good execution to date, more or less maintaining its dominant share in the competitive, fast-growing search market. The company's focus on innovation, strategic acquisitions and Android OS should continue to generate strong cash flows. However, the promise of Google's non-search businesses continue getting pushed into future even as the company's spending keeps rising. (You canread the full research report onAlphabet here >>>)Amgenshares struggled last year, but came back strong following the election as fears of restrictive pricing and regulatory strictures eased. The stock has been down in a big way since March 1st, but has still done better than the peer group over the past year. The Zacks analyst points out that Amgen remains well positioned for growth with several blockbuster drugs in its portfolio. Amgen's growth products - Prolia, Xgeva, Vectibix, Nplate and Sensipar - are all performing well. Additionally, Amgen's restructuring plan should make it leaner and more cost efficient. Estimates have declined lately ahead of the company's Q1 earnings release. The company has a positive record of earnings surprises in the recent quarters. (You canread the full research report onAmgenhere >>>)Lowe'sshares have outperformed the Zacks Building Products - Retail industry over the last three months, gaining +13.6% vs. +7.9%. An improving jobs picture, gradual recovery in the housing market and merchandising initiatives along with efforts to provide better omni-channel customer experience bode well for Lowe's. It also remains well positioned to reap the benefits of strategic acquisitions done earlier. Better-than-expected results in the final quarter of 2016 prompted management to provide an encouraging outlook for fiscal 2017. However, the Zacks analyst thinks stiff competition and cannibalization still remain major concerns. Of late estimates have been stable.

Apple Gets Self-Driving Car Permit: What's at Stake for the Industry?;4/17/2017;"Last Friday, it was reported that iPhone makerApple Inc.AAPLreceived a permit to begin testing self-driving vehicles in California, signaling that the tech giant could be ready to design or build autonomous vehicle technology, as well as bring its secret ""Project Titan"" out from the dark.According to the state's Department of Motor Vehicleswebsite, the permit allows Apple to test autonomous driving technology in three 2015 Lexus RX 450h luxury hybrid sport utility vehicles; the company will also have six drivers permitted to operate the vehicles.Project Titan, Apple's very secretive self-driving car effort, has been in development for several years now, though the firm has never formally acknowledged it. Recently, the whole thingappeared to be in flux, with Apple reportedly deciding to focus on self-driving software instead of fully autonomous cars.Late last year, Apple submitted a letter to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, saying it ""uses machine learning to make its products and services smarter, more intuitive and more personal. The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation."" Many took this at the time as Apple's strongest hint that the company was still developing self-driving technology.However, Apple joins a seriously crowded space. You already have big players like TeslaTSLA, Alphabet'sGOOGLWaymo, Uber, and NvidiaNVDAtesting their autonomous car technology in California, in addition to traditional automakers like Ford MotorsF, General MotorsGM, Volkswagen'sVLKAYAudi unit, and VolvoVLVLYracing to get a self-driving car model on the road.Because Project Titan is still being kept under wraps, it's hard to say how behind or ahead Apple is compared to its new competitors in the self-driving car industry. A company sourcereportedly told Bloombergthat autonomous vehicle testing would begin ""soon,"" but I think it's safe to say that when an Apple prototype finally hits the road, the entire industry will surely be in for a shakeup.Apple redefined how consumers think of a computer, a portable music player, a smartphone, a tablet, and even a watch, so it's not that improbable to think that they will be the company to help redefine how Americans think of a car, and what it means to drive one.The Best & Worst of ZacksmakeArticleAd();Today you are invited to download the full, up-to-the-minute list of 220 Zacks Rank #1 ""Strong Buys"" free of charge.

Why Suitors Are Flocking to Toshiba's Chip Business;4/17/2017;"Toshiba has been in trouble since the surfacing of accounting irregularities in its Westinghouse nuclear business that included cost overruns on nuclear construction projects as well as overstatement of profit from the years 2008 through 2014. The company expects to report an annual loss of $9 billion this year due to write-downs related to Westinghouse and has given a warning that it may not be able to continue as a going concern as a result. This ultimately also led to tensions with auditors PriceWaterhouseCoopers.But not all of this 142-year old electronics conglomerate is mired in losses; one section that is doing rather well is the flash memory chip business, where it has a JV with SanDisk (now Western Digital). So Toshiba needs to sell this business and install proper internal controls, which if unsatisfactory, will lead to its de-listing. Which is why it has put this business on auction.While the front runners in the bidding process are BroadcomAVGOand private equity firm Silver Lake Partners, Taiwan's Foxconn (Honhai Precision Industry), South Korean chipmaker SK Hynix, and Western DigitalWDCitself, some news reports indicate that Softbank, AppleAAPL, AlphabetGOOGLand AmazonAMZNmay also be interested.Of these, Broadcom's first round offer of 2.5 trillion yen ($23 billion) and Foxconn's 2 trillion yen are the highest bids. Hynix's bid is unknown as is Western Digital's, but WDC has said that analysts estimate the fair value to be around 1.5 trillion yen.Why the Excitement?Toshiba is the second largest NAND flash memory maker, a technology that is increasingly taking over mobile devices and finding application in the cloud. The advantage of flash memory is in its speed and reliability, while the regular hard drive storage is cheaper but shorter-lived. As the cost of flash drives falls over time, it will be used more broadly and will replace or at least supplement hard drive storage.Since most tech players mentioned in the previous section either sell memory or buy it, they would gain leverage from acquiring the technology. Those that sell can augment their current offerings while those that buy will have another way to consolidate their supply chain and thus lower costs while also gaining technological advamtage.What Could Be the ResultThe deal will have a political angle to it, since the Japanese government is unlikely to approve a sale to investors that might bring risk to national security. Because of its links to China, a sale to Foxconn will likely not be approved by the government, even if Japanese banks agree to partner with it to finance the deal. So Hynix is better placed to win.On the other hand, the government will be quicker to approve the deal if the unit stays between Japanese and American owners. Since Western Digital has issues with Broadcom, and it will most likely have a say (given its $13 billion investment in the JV over several years and current agreement with Toshiba), Broadcom may not be able to bid successfully in this case. But Western Digital won't be able to buy out the unit unless it gets itself some partners (the company may not be able to dish out more cash so soon after SanDisk).That leaves combinations of American and Japanese players, which may include Apple and Softbank. Apple will prefer that Foxconn gets a stake because it is its major supplier. So Toshiba may successfully sell a portion of the business to the Apple-Foxconn combination or Apple-Softbank-Foxconn combination or a combination that includes Softbank and other players.The Best & Worst of ZacksToday you are invited to download the full, up-to-the-minute list of 220 Zacks Rank #1 ""Strong Buys"" free of charge.

Netflix (NFLX) Close to 100M Subscriber Mark?;4/17/2017;"Per Investor's Business Daily which quoted a report by Goldman Sachs,Netflix Inc.'sNFLXworldwide subscriber base could be close to 100 million when it reports first-quarter 2017 earnings.Per Heath Terry, a Goldman Sachs analyst, the streaming giant is expected to add 4 million international subscribers and 1.7 million U.S. subscribers in the going-to-be reported first quarter.Terry stated, ""We expect Netflix to report subscriber additions above its original guidance driven by a strong content slate, stable pricing, and maturing international markets. While investor expectations have followed NFLX's share price higher, we expect 1Q results will be further confirmation of the long-term scale and profitability of the platform.""Netflix, Inc. PriceNetflix, Inc. Price|Netflix, Inc. QuoteOriginal Content - Key CatalystNetflix has been drawing strength from its growing portfolio of original content. This apart, it remains focused on international expansion as it battles slowing domestic subscriber growth.Per Terry, Netflix's international markets such as France and Germany are close to saturation but the company can expect better growth rate from India and Japan.Further, recently added features like offline viewing and skipping opening credits reflect Netflix's focus on enhancing user experience, which is a positive.Meanwhile, Investopedia, which quoted research firm Comscore, stated that Netflix remains the leader in the over-the-top (OTT) services space despite stiff competition from Alphabet'sGOOGLYouTube and Amazon.com'sAMZNAmazon Prime Video service. The study is based on data collected in the month of December last year.Furthermore, reportedly, in Dec 2016, Netflix had the highest penetration rate of 75% when it came to OTT services, followed by YouTube with 53%. Amazon and Hulu have penetration rates of 33% and 17%, respectively. Notably, subscribers of Netflix clocked 28 hours of average viewing time per month, closely trailing Sling TV with an average viewing time of 47 hours per month.Share Price MomentumWe note that Netflix has outperformed the ZacksBroadcasting-Radio/TVindustry in the last year. While the stock returned 31.8%, the industry gained 15.5%.The outperformance can be attributed to the company's continuing subscriber growth and an expanding original content product portfolio.Currently Netflix carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stock to ConsiderA better-ranked stock in the broader technology space is Salem Media Group, IncSALM, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Does Sustainable Investing Make Sense? ETFs in Focus;4/17/2017;"Sustainable investing is an investing discipline that aside from generating attractive returns also focuses on factors like environment, society, and governance (ESG). It focuses on investing in companies that promote environment friendly policies, support human rights, and have ideologies in line with the society's long-term benefit.Companies with strong governance principles are generally at lower risk of regulatory hindrance. This generally helps them to attain higher ratings and thus exhibits higher confidence in the company.However, the real question is, whether it generates investment benefits. Various studies have proved that sustainable practices have led to lower cost of capital and better operational performance of the firm, which in turn has led to higher cash flow generation. To discuss this further, we will now talk about a few ETF investments in this space.iShares MSCI USA ESG Select ETFKLDThis fund targets exposure to companies that have strong ESG policies relative to their peers.It has AUM of $519.07 million and charges a fee of 50 basis points a year. Information Technology, Health Care, and Industrials take the top three spots with 24.85%, 14.20%, and 12.85% allocation, respectively (as of April 10, 2017). 3MMMM, Microsoft CorporationMSFT, and Apple IncAAPLare the top three stocks with 4.48%, 4.47%, and 3.75% allocation, respectively (as of April 10, 2017). The fund returned 13.37% in the past one year and 6.25% in the year-to-date time frame (as of April 11, 2017).iShares MSCI KLD 400 Social ETFDSIThis fund targets exposure to ESG friendly companies.It has AUM of $804.70 million and charges a fee of 50 basis points a year. Information Technology, Consumer Discretionary, and Health Care take the top three spots with 27.17%, 13.71%, and 12.13% allocation, respectively (as of April 10, 2017). Microsoft Corporation, Alphabet Inc Class CGOOG, and Alphabet Inc Class AGOOGLare the top three stocks with 5.20%, 2.75%, and 2.68% allocation, respectively (as of April 10, 2017). The fund returned 11.49% in the past one year and 5.07% in the year-to-date time frame (as of April 11, 2017).SPDR S&P 500 Fossil Fuel Free ETFSPYXThis fund targets exposure to fossil fuel free companies tracking the S&P 500 Fossil Fuel Free Index.It has AUM of $133.5 million and charges a fee of 20 basis points a year. Information Technology, Financials, and Health Care take the top three spots with 23.07%, 15.03%, and 14.62% allocation, respectively (as of April 10, 2017). Apple Inc, Microsoft Corporation, and Amazon.com IncAMZNare the top three stocks with 3.94%, 2.65%, and 1.87% allocation, respectively (as of April 10, 2017). The fund returned 13.77% in the past one year and 6.03% in the year-to-date time frame (as of April 11, 2017).Source: Yahoo FinanceTo ConcludeIt can therefore be seen that except DSI, the other two ETFs discussed have outperformed the broader market represented by SPY in the past one year. KLD ($19.5 million), DSI ($17.66 million), and SPYX ($14.03 million) have seen positive inflows this year, compared to an outflow of $2.594 billion in SPY (as of April 10, 2017). Studies predict that a large number of investors are looking at socially responsible investing as an option nowadays, and that these policies are bound to have apositive impact on firmsin the longer term.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your   inbox?Zacks' free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.Get it free >>Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Apple Inc. (AAPL) Rumor Points to Multi-User Support for iOS 11;4/17/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOne of the biggest advantagesApple Inc.'s(NADAQ:AAPL) tablet competitors hold over the iPad is the support for multiple user accounts. With the exception of the education market, AAPL's stance has always been one iPad, one user. But that could change with iOS 11. A new report claims the latest version of Apple's tvOS for the Apple TV includes support for multiple accounts. And if that's the case, there's a possibility we would see iOS multi-user capability as well, when Apple introduces iOS 11 at WWDC 2017.makeArticleAd();Source: AppleOn the surface, a tablet being able to support multiple user accounts may not seem like a big deal. But for many people - especially families - it is. Since Apple first started selling iPads, consumers have had the choice of buying one for each person in their family, or dealing with the consequences of everyone sharing the same Apple user ID.Why Support for Multiple User Accounts MattersBecause there is no iOS multi-user support, this means that if a parent let a child borrow their iPad, any changes that child made would stick when the adult went to use it. That includes apps downloaded (or deleted), preferences and user settings changed. In addition, the person borrowing the iPad would have full access to any content, including potentially sensitive documents and photos.With kids trying to share a single iPad, this is a virtual guarantee of non-stop fighting that simply isn't worth the hassle for most parents.Apple's tablet competition supports multiple user accounts on one device.Microsoft Corporation's(NASDAQ:MSFT) Windows tablets support multi-user login.Alphabet Inc's(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) introduced multiple user support for tablets with Android 4.2 in 2012.Amazon.com, Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AMZN) Fire tablets offer Household Profiles with support for two adults and four children on each device, with shared content access plus private content and personal settings based on who's signed in on the device.The 11 Best Dividend Stocks to BuyAppleMaybe Working on iOS Multi-User Support for iOS 119to5Macpicked up on a report fromThe Verifierthat claimsAAPL is adding support for multiple accounts to the next version of tvOSfor the Apple TV.What does this have to do with iPads? AAPL's tvOS is based on iOS. If Apple introduces a fundamental feature like support for multiple accounts in tvOS, there's a good chance the same capability is built into iOS. With that new version of tvOS scheduled to be unveiled atWWDC 2017in June, that means we may just hear about iOS multi-user support when Apple takes the wraps off iOS 11 at that same event.And Appledidbuild in a form of support for multiple users on iPads -available exclusively to the education market- with iOS 9.3 in early 2016.What AAPL Would GainWith support for multiple user accounts, Apple would have a shot at selling iPads to a demographic it hasn't really actively targeted in the past.There are many families with limited income for buying gadgets. The cost of an iPad isn't necessarily a barrier. But buying one for each child (plus the parents) may well be out of reach. Many of these households have turned to Android and Amazon Fire tablets not because they prefer these over iPads, but because with support for multiple users, they are more affordable.Apple Inc. Scores Higher Global Mac Sales Amid Broad PC DeclinesIf AAPL introduces iOS multi-user support for the iPad, it stands a far better chance of capturing a bigger chunk of this market that it has largely ignored.The idea of iOS multi-user support for iPads may seem far-fetched. After all, Apple has always followed the strategy of one iPad per user. Supporting multiple accounts has always been seen as a potential threat to iPad sales.However, times are changing. AAPL's iPad sales continue to slide. And the company has already done the unthinkable, with therelease in March of the new full-sized iPad for just $329. We'll find out at WWDC 2017 if Apple is willing to take the next step toward making the iPad accessible to a much wider demographic with iOS multi-user support.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceApple Inc.

Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock Isn’t What Goldman Thinks;4/17/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsShares ofAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMD) have been under heavy selling pressure of late, falling almost 14% from $14.16 on April 5 to last week's low of $12.22. The reason? Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari, downgraded AMD stock to ""Sell"" with a $11 price target.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockAMD shares closed Friday at $12.31, suggesting there's possible downside of almost 11%. Despite acknowledging the strong execution AMD has delivered under CEO Lisa Su, Hari noted strong competitive threats from the likes ofIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) andNvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA).All told, the analyst - who expects AMD to earn just 2 cents per share in fiscal 2017 (versus consensus of 8 cents) - believes any good news about Advanced Micro Devices is already priced into the shares.But that's where he's wrong.I expect AMD stock, which has fallen 12% in thirty days, to reach $16 in 2017, delivering 30% gains on the back of greater GPU adoption and rising profit margins.The Bull Case for AMD StockThe Sunnyvale, Calif.-based chip company, which has come back by almost 400% over the past two years to prove doubters wrong, is set to report first quarter fiscal 2017 earnings results in a couple of weeks. For the quarter that ended March, Wall Street expects the company to report a loss of 4 cents per share on revenues of $984.38 million. This compares to the year-ago quarter when the company lost 12 cents per share on $832 million in revenue.7 Top Emerging Markets Stocks to Buy NowFor the full year ending in December, AMD is expected to earn 8 cents per share, versus a loss of 14 cents a year ago, while full-year revenue of $4.74 billion would mark an increased of the 10.9% year-over-year. The significant fiscal year expected improvements - particularly in EPS - presents an opportunity for both investors and traders take advantage of the recent pullback in AMD stock, caused strictly by Goldman's downgrade.Not only does AMD continue to benefited from strong growth in its popular Radeon line of GPUs (Graphics Processing Unit), there are also signs that the declines in PC sales have begun to stabilize.And thanks to the company's recent partnership withAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL), where its FirePro server GPUs will power Alphabet's cloud platform in 2017, AMD's revenue growth should accelerate in the quarters ahead.Bottom LineWith AMD stock skyrocketing some 355% over the past year, it's understandable to question how much more runway is left for the stock to fly, which seems to be the basis for Goldman's downgrade.But with Advanced Micro's GPU strength still gaining traction, combined withrecent betson VR/AR, AMD stock should be owned, not sold.As of this writing, Richard Saintvilus did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceBuy Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Stock Without WorryApple Inc.

Make Kinder Morgan Inc (KMI) Stock Pay You Big Dividends Again;4/17/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIn October 2016, I shared aKinder Morgan Inc(NYSE:KMI) trade that yielded more than 60% on money risked. That iron condor range turned out to be near-perfect, so today, I want to sell more risk on KMI stock ahead of its first-quarter earnings report after Wednesday's bell.makeArticleAd();Source:Roy Luck via FlickrFundamentally, Kinder Morgan seems pricey given a price-to-earnings ratio of nearly 90. KMI shares have a decent dividend of about 2.3%, but obviously that's nothing like what investors were used to years ago. Now, it's low enough that rising interest rates are a real threat.Today's bet, however, is meant to trade Wall Street's perception of KMI's fair value, not my own assessment of it. And I want to sell risk against support levels that are likely to hold through 2017.Technically, KMI stock is in the middle of a fairly wide 10-month range and just above a well-consolidated zone. Both of these should provide defense to the bulls.Click to EnlargeFor the short-term, I do have to recognize the potential threat of a bearish technical pattern. Losing the $20.60 per share level could invite momentum sellers all the way down to $19.80, which was the last serious support level.3 Dividend Stocks to Buy for 12 Months of IncomeMy position will allow for that much room and more.How to Trade KMI StockThe bet:Sell the KMI Jan 2018 $17.50 naked put. This is a bullish trade for which I collect 80 cents to open. But by doing so, I commit to buying the shares at $17.5 if Kinder Morgan falls below it. This is risky, but I am leaving an 18% margin for error from current price which translates into an 85% theoretical chance of success.Selling naked puts is not suitable for all investors. That's OK. I can change this trade into a credit put spread to make it tamer.The alternate:Sell the KMI Jan 2018 $17.5/$15 credit put spread. This too is a bullish trade with the same chances of success, but one where the risk is finite.

Shares of NVDA are off 10% since broker Pacific Crest cut semiconductor outfit Nvidia to ""underweight"" from ""sector weight"" back on April 4.Pacific Crest cited a saturated GPU market, lowerNintendo Co., Ltd (ADR)(OTCMKTS:NTDOY) Switch sales margins and a likely pause in the company's data center business asreasons behind the downgradein NVDA.However,repeated bullish analyst noteson Nvidia from Goldman over the past couple months are net-net underwater and well-removed from a $130 price target in NVDA stock.10 Spring Cleaning Tips for Your PortfolioSo, who's right and who's wrong? Only time is really going to tell, but I personally welcome the near-sighted focus on Pac Crest's bearish Nvidia stock narrative by other investors.The way I see the situation in Nvidia, the current about-face in one of 2016's best-performing stocks is creating an opportunity, to pick up a company entrenched in some of the market's strongest, secular growth areas, on the cheap and maybe a good deal cheaper.NVDA Stock Daily ChartClick to EnlargeLast month, following a 21% corrective move that reset NVDA stock's base count, I was optimistic of higher prices in the making. The constructive price action looked sufficient to have removed prior excessive and erratic behavior that grew over the course of NVDA's massive bullish run during 2016.Over the past couple weeks, though, Nvidia stock has proceeded to get knocked back down and challenge its corrective lows. The evolving price action puts shares into a potentially bullish, double-bottom situation if NVDA is able to reverse higher.If NVDA shares continue to move down in price, a lower-low variation of the double-bottom pattern could set up as low as the drawn in neckline near $91.50.Below the neckline and Nvidia stock bears will have momentum in their favor down to $84 a share. A decline of that size works out to a corrective move of just over 30%. It also offers a test of the 200-day simple moving average and 38% retracement level from the February 2016 low.So what if NVDA still isn't finished correcting and fails to hold those supports above today's pop? That's potentially very bad news. Technically, Nvidia stock could be following through on a measured move from a head-and-shoulders pattern. Conservatively, a break of the neckline signals an eventual move in NVDA down near $68.NVDA Bullish Spread ComboFor investors that are inclined to be bullish on NVDA, but appreciate the risk of a topping pattern and earnings on the horizon, I like the idea of combining a bullishly targeted long call butterfly and out-of-the-money put vertical spread.Reviewing the Nvidia options board and with shares closing the past trading day at $95.49, a package of selling the May $85/$80 put spread and purchasing the May $100/$110/$120 call butterfly is priced for 75 cents or better. For 75 cents, the combination allows the trader to have an upside profit range from $100.75 to $119.25. The sweet spot at $110 allows for profits to max out at $9.25 if NVDA were to land on the strike at expiration.Above $120, the trader would forfeit 75 cents at expiration. For bulls of course this represents a sacrifice. Our view is this is a reasonable allowance considering it matches the prior high in Nvidia and should take more than an earnings beat, to be cleared.Go Long Bank of America Corp (BAC) Stock Into EarningsIf NVDA fails to rally above $100 or declines in price, at expiration the trader is out 75 cents if the stock is between $85 and $100 a share. Below $85 and losses begin to accrue one-for-one with a decline in Nvidia shares. At $80 or lower, a loss of $5.75 would be realized.In the event of this type of dramatic move, however, and a stock purchase price that's never worse than $85.75, the trader may see this as a nice starting point for building a longer-term position.Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in any of the securities or their derivatives mentioned in this article.

Qualcomm, Inc. (QCOM) Stock Is Still a Buy Despite Its Issues;4/17/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIn the bookHow Google Works, Eric Schmidt and Jonathan Rosenberg talk extensively about the convergence of three big trends in business: the Internet, mobile communication, and cloud computing. Semiconductor giantQualcomm, Inc.(NASDAQ:QCOM) has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of this convergence.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockIts chip technology has helped power billions of cellphones since its founding in the mid-1980s. QCOM offers both chips and licenses to its technology that resulted in $23.6 billion in sales last year and $7.4 billion in operating cash flow.That 31.4% cash flow margin demonstrates that Qualcomm is fantastically profitable. Last year, that totaled $3.81 in reported earnings. For the full current year, analysts project a big jump in earnings to $4.66 per share on sales of $23.8 billion. They expect only a modest bump in sales and profits for fiscal 2018.The Dangers of QualcommThe slow growth in recent years (sales peaked in fiscal 2014 at $26.5 billion) is a key reason that QCOM stock has sagged. Its highest level was a hair above $81 per share in April 2014. However, shares now trade below $53 per share, close to its lows over the past 52 weeks.The competition also doesn't appreciate that Qualcomm is so dominant. Its CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) technology is prevalent in nearly every cell phone the 3G and 4G wireless communication standards. Any cell phone manufacturer that makes these handsets has to pay a royalty to Qualcomm.The 11 Best Dividend Stocks to BuyThis has led to a slew of legal challenges to its patents. Just this week,Blackberry Ltd(NASDAQ:BBRY), an erstwhile giant in the cell phone market,was awardedan $815 million ""refund."" A court ruled that Qualcomm owed the refund to Blackberry, suggesting that Blackberry had overpaid on its royalties to Qualcomm because of its flagging sales of Blackberry mobile devices. The decision looks to be binding, and Qualcomm will make the payment out of its large cash reserves.iPhone juggernautApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL)is also fightingwith Qualcomm. The dispute involves both of Qualcomm's businesses - it supplies chips to iPhones, and Apple also pays it royalties. The current spat is said to total $1 billion, or slightly more than the Blackberry settlement.A quick search of Qualcomm's other disputes includeSamsung Electronics(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) and Chinese firms includingMeizu. China went after Qualcomm recently, accusing it of violating antitrust rules because of its chip and patent stronghold on mobile devices. Since then, it has sought to settle and renegotiate patent agreements.Add it all up, and investing in Qualcomm is not exactly straightforward.The Bull CaseQCOM stock currently yields close to 4%, though, so there is consolation for patient investors hoping that the company can successfully navigate current and future disputes, and eventually grow steadily again.A considerable cash hoard also helps protect on the downside. First quarter cash and marketable securities totaled nearly $30 billion. Clearly, it can afford a large number of unfavorable patent dispute results, if it came to that.Qualcomm also announced last fall the acquisition ofNXP Semiconductors NV(NASDAQ:NXPI). The deal totals $38 billion and adds chip exposure to new markets including automotive, the internet of things (IoT), data centers, and networking. The deal could be a game changer for QCOM, whose current market capitalization is only about $75 billion.The merger has been approved by NXP Semiconductors shareholders and is expected to close by the end of the year. It will put Qualcomm in more direct competition with other chip providers, includingNvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA) (autonomous driving cars) andIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) (cell phones and data centers).Bottom Line on QCOM StockThe NXP Semiconductors purchase offers the best potential for Qualcomm to boost sales and profit growth. However, it is largely outside of its core mobile phone chip expertise. At worst, it suggests QCOM doesn't think its current businesses have appealing growth potential going forward.How to Trade Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Ahead of Q1 EarningsBut at 11.3 times forward earnings estimates and with a dividend yield double that of the overall market, QCOM stock looks like an interesting investment candidate. The low valuation provides downside protection should patent disputes continue to be costly and if the core chip and licensing business fails to grow again.The NXP Semiconductor purchase adds more potential for growth, though the new businesses are also extremely competitive. But while Qualcomm's management figures out the new businesses, the existing ones will continue to generate billions in cash flow for many years to come.As of this writing, Ryan Fuhrmann was long INTC.More From InvestorPlaceApple Inc.

How to Trade Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Ahead of Q1 Earnings;4/17/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe days whenAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL) could dabble in whatever side project caught its fancy may be over. Last quarter's earnings miss underscored this reality all too firmly for Alphabet investors, who had grown used to quarter after quarter of outperformance. That said, even after a bit of streamlining during the past three months, there are still no guarantees for a post-earnings rally for GOOGL stock.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockAlphabet's main source of revenue - advertising - is under fire. Increased competition fromFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB),Amazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) andSnap Inc(NYSE:SNAP) is finally catching up to the company's bottom line.What's more, Facebook's WhatsApp and Snap's Snapchat are fundamentally changing the way millennials are accessing the Internet, with trends shifting more toward messaging apps and away from broad-based search ad revenue that remains Google's bread and butter.As a result, Alphabet has made some changes during the past several months, scaling back several side projects or shuttering them entirely in favor of putting its money into more profitable ventures. Unfortunately, the moves have only ramped up quarterly earnings expectations, with analysts looking for GOOGL stock to play catch-up to last month's miss.Sentiment and ChartsCurrently, Wall Street is expecting a profit of $7.38 per share from Alphabet, down slightly from earnings of $7.50 per share in the year-ago period. Revenue is expected to come in at $24.21 billion, up 19.5% year over year.7 Energy Stocks That Will Turn 2017 on Its HeadWall Street's high hopes, meanwhile, are reflected in the brokerage community. According to Thomson/First Call, a whopping 43 of the 45 analysts following GOOGL stock rate the shares a ""buy"" or better. The 12-month consensus price target of $979.52 isn't nearly as bullish, but it still rests nearly 17% above Alphabet's current perch.Turning toward GOOGL options activity, traders remain bullish on Alphabet's quarterly report, but are showing signs of apprehension beyond next week.Currently, the April 28 put/call open interest ratio (i.e., the one likely most affected by Alphabet's April 27 earnings report) arrives at 0.52, with calls nearly doubling puts for the series. However, this ratio jumps to 0.81 for the May series, as concerns emerge about the strength of any follow-through buying.Click to EnlargeOverall, April 28 implieds are pricing in a potential post-earnings move of about 4.2%. Currently, this places the upper bound at about $875, while the lower bound lies near $805.Technical support should h0ld firm in the $800 area, but another earnings miss could force a breach and additional selling pressure. Meanwhile, $880 remains the cap on the upside, and with elevated expectations, that region may be tough to overcome.2 Trades for GOOGL StockPut Sell:I'm not convinced that Alphabet is far enough gone that another earnings miss is in the cards. However, I'm also not convinced that next week's report will live up to the bullish sentiment currently levied against the shares.Go Long Bank of America Corp (BAC) Stock Into EarningsAs such, caution in the form of a neutral-to-bullish put sell position may be the best bet for profiting on GOOGL right now.Along those lines, the May $800 put has plenty of potential. At last check, this put was bid at $7.10, or $710 per contract. The upside to this put sell strategy is that you keep the premium as long as GOOGL stock closes above $800 when these options expire. The downside is that should Alphabet trade below $800 ahead of expiration, you could be assigned 100 shares for each sold put at a cost of $800 per share.Call Spread:If you're willing to buy into the hype ahead of earnings, then a May $860/$865 bull call spread has plenty of potential. At last check, this spread was offered at 53 cents, or $53 per pair of contracts. Breakeven lies at $860.53, while a maximum profit of $4.47, or $447 per pair of contracts, is possible if GOOGL closes at or above $865 when May options expire.As of this writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceApple Inc.

Disney Studios Continues Its Box Office Domination;4/15/2017;"2016 was a pretty good year for movies. According to areport(link opens PDF) by the Motion Picture Association of   America (MPAA), the North American box office total reached $11.4   billion, a record-setting year. And the undisputed box   office champ wasThe Walt Disney Company(NYSE: DIS) .The House of Mouse had four of the top five, and six of the   top 10 grossing movies as measured by domestic box office,   according to website Box Office Mojo. The global totals are even   more impressive: Disney landed all of the top five spots for   worldwide box office. As icing on the cake, the company became   the first film studio to rake in over $7 billion in ticket sales   in a single year.RankTitleDistributorWorldwide Box Office (millions)1Captain America: Civil WarBuena Vista$1,153.302Rogue One: A Star Wars StoryBuena Vista$1,055.573Finding DoryBuena Vista$1,028.604ZootopiaBuena Vista$1,023.805The Jungle Book(2016)Buena Vista$966.606The Secret Life of PetsUniversal$875.507Batman v Superman: Dawn of JusticeWarner Bros.$873.308Fantastic Beasts and Where To Find ThemWarner Bros.$813.209Deadpool21st Century Fox$783.1010Suicide SquadWarner Bros.$745.60Data source: Box Office Mojo.makeArticleAd();Another banner year?It appears that this year, Disney's studios will continue its   winning ways. By the time you read this, fan favoriteBeauty and the Beastwill likely have crossed $1 billion in worldwide ticket sales.   Earlier this week, Piper Jaffray released its semiannual survey   of U.S. teens, ""Taking Stock With Teens"" (TSWT). One of the key   takeaways from the report was that Disney dominated the list of   most anticipated films among teens for 2017, nabbing three of the   top eight spots. The aforementionedBeauty and the Beast,Star Wars: The Last Jedi, andGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2took second, third, and fourth places, respectively.According to the MPAA, audiences between 18 and 25 attend more   movies than any other demographic, so this helps shed light on   their prospects for the coming year. If you thought the   anticipation of a blockbuster movie season would be reflected in   the stock price, you might be surprised to learn that the stock   hasn't made much headway in the last two years.What gives?The cable industry has come under pressure in recent years due   to the rise of streaming services like those offered byNetflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) , as well as other online offerings likeAlphabet's subsidiary Google's YouTube.TWST reported that 38% of teens reported using Netflix and 26%   viewed YouTube on a daily basis. Those who reported watching   cable TV had declined in each of the previous four reports from   29% in late 2015 to 23% most recently. The phenomenon of   cord-cutting -- those canceling their cable subscriptions in   favor of free and lower-priced options -- is the culprit.   Research firm Leichtman Researchreportedthat the top cable providers lost an estimated 795,000 net video   subscribers in 2016, up from estimated losses of 445,000 in   2015.The majority of cable packages include a subscription to   Disney's flagship cable sports channel, ESPN. Over the years, it   had emerged as a powerhouse in sports programming. It negotiated   lengthy multibillion-dollar contracts to acquire exclusive rights   to broadcast games from all the major sports in the U.S. and is   now tied to those in the face of a falling subscriber base.   Disney doesn't break out ESPN from its broader media networks   segment, which accounts for 42% of Disney's revenue, but revenue   from the segment declined 2% year over year in the most recent   quarter, while income fell 11%. Investors fear that if   subscribers continue to defect, rising costs and fewer   subscribers will pressure Disney's results.Beauty and the Beastis closing in on $1 billion in worldwide box office. Image     source: Disney.Missing the big pictureThe knee-jerk reaction by some investors fails to take into   account the bigger picture. Losing only about 2% of its   subscribers in each of the last three years is hardly a death   sentence. Disney has been working behind the scenes on   measures to stem the tide of losses at its sports behemoth. ESPN   is included in most skinny bundles, and Disney has been   experimenting with a direct-to-consumer service, powered by its   $1 billion minority acquisition of BAMTech, a video-streaming   service developed by Major League Baseball. Disney has also   embarked on a campaign of cost savings, laying off some of ESPN's   high-priced on-air personalities.While ESPN may continue to weigh on Disney's results, other   areas will be picking up the slack. The company opened its newest   theme park, Shanghai Disneyland, in mid-2016, which should ramp   up and provide a revenue boost to the parks and resorts segment.   Disney is licensing recent theatrical releases to Netflix through   2018 and the two are partnering on a series of programs featuring   Marvel's Defenders -- Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, and   Iron Fist. As its studio continues to churn out hits,   Disney's marketing machine incorporates those characters   into every facet of the its empire, from plush toys to lunch   boxes to streaming deals with Netflix. ESPN may be the lion's   share of Disney's revenue now, but over time, it will become less   of the total and investors can go back to focusing on what the   company does best: telling stories.10 stocks we like better than Walt DisneyWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Machine Learning Stocks: 3 Things Investors Should Know;4/15/2017;"You may have come across the term ""machine learning"" while   digging around for new technology ideas to invest in, or perhaps   you've heard of it while researching the broader (but related)   artificial intelligence space. In any case, machine learning   probably isn't an idea that most investors know about, so it's   worth taking the time to walk through a few basic aspects to help   you get started.Let's take a quick look at where the term came from, how   machine learning is being used right now, and what its market   opportunity is. Of course, I'll discuss a few machine learning   stocks investors should know about as well.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();1. What exactly is machine learning and how is it being   used?Machine learning may sound like a new tech concept, but it's   been around for decades. Back in 1959, the computer scientist and   artificial intelligence pioneer Arthur Samuel coined the term and   described it as the ""field of study that gives computers the   ability to learn without being explicitly   programmed."" Samuel worked on early machine learning systems   atIBM(NYSE: IBM) and evendeveloped a checkers programthat was capable of beating a checkers master. This was a   significant feat for a computer at the time (1962), and it is one   of the earliest examples of artificial intelligence.For a solid example of machine learning that we can all   recognize, consider the search results provided byAlphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google. Lukas Biewald, the CEO   of an AI company, wrote in TechCrunchlast yearthat ""What makes Google special is that it knows which matching   result is the most relevant; the way that it knows is through   machine learning.""Google has applied machine learning to its other businesses as   well. The company's recently spun-offdriverless car company, Waymo, uses machine learning to teach cars how they should   react to specific situations by letting them observe how a   driver, or another car, responds to certain driving   scenarios.Other tech companies are doing exciting things with machine   learning as well. Graphics processing unit (GPU) makerNVIDIA(NASDAQ: NVDA) uses machine learning for computer vision, which   allows computers to see and interpret what they're looking at   (e.g., the cameras on a driverless car being able to identify a   stop sign).2. How big will this market be?Many estimates for the machine learning market are lumped   together with the broader artificial intelligence market, but a   few specific estimates do exist. For example, research firm   MarketsandMarkets says that machine learning as a service (MLaaS)   will grow from $613.4 million in 2016 to $3.7 billion by   2021.A separate estimate by Transparency Market Research says the   compound annual growth rate of MLaaS will be 38.4% between 2017   and 2025, and become a $19.8 billion market by the end of that   time.Whichever estimate you choose, it's clear that machine   learning applications are expanding, and that should fuel growth   for companies creating services based on that technology.3. Who are the major players?I've already mentioned how Google has tapped into machine   learning for some of its business and how NVIDIA is using machine   learning for computer vision. It's worth mentioning that aside   from NVIDIA's own machine learning uses for semi-autonomous   vehicles, it also sells its GPUs to other companies, including   Google andFacebook,for machine learning. That's helping the company tap into   broader AI market, which is creating a$5 billion opportunity for NVIDIA.But NVIDIA isn't the only chipmaker that stands to benefit   from machine learning.Intel(NASDAQ: INTC)  is looking to machine learning to spur new   chip sales as the PC market dwindles. The company is in the   process of buying the semi-autonomous car technology makerMobileyeso that it can set itself up to benefit from the   driverless-car market, which relies heavily on machine learning.   AnMIT Technology Reviewarticlenoted that ""Intel's acquisition of Mobileye shows how   critical data and machine learning are to the auto industry's   future.""And just as IBM was at the forefront of machine learning   decades ago, the company is still helping to lead the way with   its own enterprise machine learning services. The company   says that its machine learning solutions, like Watson, can use   enterprise data to automatically create self-learning behavioral   models for businesses.The company is so bullish on machine learning and its impact   on businesses that it calls the technology the ""21st century's   Industrial Revolution"" and believes that machine learning is the   first step toward a broader cognitive computing world.Just a few months ago, Deloitte published areportmentioning that 300 million smartphones will have some form of   machine learning built into them this year, and that soon drones,   cars, virtual and augmented reality devices, and even medical   tools will have their own built-in machine learning capabilities.   It's clear from these predictions -- and the current machine   learning uses -- that this technology revolution is already   underway. And investors would be wise to take a closer look at   the companies that are leading the charge.Find out why Nvidiais one of the 10 best stocks to buy nowMotley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent     more than a decade beating the market.

3 Stocks We Like More Than NVIDIA;4/14/2017;"Shares of graphics chip companyNVIDIA(NASDAQ: NVDA) soared 220% last year, driven by explosive growth   in its core gaming business coupled with even more impressive   growth in its enterprise and automotive segments. NVIDIA is at   the center of multiple trends, including virtual reality, machine   learning, and self-driving cars, and investors have not been shy   about awarding the stock a nosebleed valuation.For those not willing to pay more than 8 times sales for   NVIDIA but who still want to invest in emerging technology like   self-driving cars,Intel(NASDAQ: INTC) ,Qualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM) , andAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) are three good options.A newcomer to driverless car technologyDaniel Miller(Intel Corporation):To be fair, it's pretty difficult to find many stocks   better than NVIDIA. However, Intel Corporation is cheaper and   less volatile than NVIDIA, and offers investors a strong angle in   the future of driverless cars, with a dividend yield of 3%.makeArticleAd();Again, to be fair, Intel might not have made this list if it   wasn't for the recent acquisition of my favoritedriverless car stock,Mobileye, the global leader in computer vision for Advanced Driver   Assistance Systems (ADAS). Intel estimates automated driving   systems, data, and services could be a $70 billion addressable   market as soon as 2030, and the acquisition will be immediately   accretive to adjusted earnings and free cash flow.Image source: Intel.Mobileye already boasts major partnerships with 25 automakers,   including some of the world's largest such as General Motors,   Honda, Ford, Nissan, and many high-end luxury brands. Mobileye's   EyeQ chips were installed in roughly 16 million vehicles at the   end of 2016, and its EyeQ4 and EyeQ5 chips for level 3 and 4   autonomous driving vehicles will go into production in 2018 and   2020.With Intel's acquisition of Mobileye, the combined company   will be a leading end-to-end autonomous driving technology   provider with a world-class supply chain. Intel still faces   headwinds with the PC industry in decline, but its move to   acquire Mobileye and jump into the future of driverless vehicles   is promising. It's also trading at a cheap valuation of roughly   17 times earnings, and it will pay you a 3% dividend yield while   management tries to revive its growth story.Lawsuits and self-driving carsTim Green(Qualcomm):With NVIDIA trading at an optimistic valuation, a better bet   could be Qualcomm. Qualcomm makes most of its profit from   licensing key technology and intellectual property, but its $47   billion acquisition ofNXP Semiconductors, expected to close before the end of the year, will make it the   leading supplier of semiconductor products to the automotive   industry. This will put Qualcomm in direct competition with   NVIDIA in the driver assistance and autonomous vehicle   markets.The deal closing is not a sure thing, and Qualcomm is also   facing someserious headwindsthat could derail the stock. The company was sued byAppleearlier this year, with the iPhone maker accusing it of charging   unfair royalties and withholding payments. That news came just   days after the Federal Trade Commission charged Qualcomm with   anti-competitive sales and licensing tactics. With the majority   of Qualcomm's pre-tax profit derived from licensing, any threat   to the licensing business could be big trouble for the   company.It's impossible to tell how these lawsuits will play out, but   investors have pushed down the stock in reaction. Shares of   Qualcomm are down 13% so far this year, creating an opportunity   for those who believe the company will emerge from these   challenges unscathed. With the stock trading for just 12 times   the average analyst estimate for fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings, a   favorable outcome for Qualcomm, or the successful closing of the   NXP deal, could send the stock soaring.Stop searching for a great tech stockDan Caplinger(Alphabet):Technology stocks come in and out of vogue, and NVIDIA has been   one of the darlings of the tech world for more than a year now.   By contrast, Alphabet has languished, posting only minimal gains   in 2016 and underperforming the Nasdaq Composite so far this year   as well.Yet over the long run, Alphabet has a number of growth drivers   that should help push the stock higher. The key search engine   market continues to be a cash cow for the company, with Google   having huge penetration rates both on mobile and on desktop   devices. In addition, YouTube has retained its dominance in the   video realm, and efforts like the Gmail service, the Chrome   internet browser, and the Android operating system for mobile   devices have been extremely popular as well.Some investors worry that non-core projects like self-driving   cars might end up siphoning profits from the more successful   businesses. Yet those moonshots also carry some potential for   outsized gains if they pan out well.With NVIDIA having already generated impressive returns, its   remaining upside is less clear than it was this time last year.

Better Buy: Alphabet Inc vs. Baidu Inc (ADR);4/14/2017;"They say that data is so valuable, it is the new oil. With it,   you can offer advertisers the most targeted ads possible. Without   it, you are drowning in a sea of competition with absolutely no   edge.This is the true advantage that investors in search engines   likeAlphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL)  Google andBaidu(NASDAQ: BIDU) enjoy. Aside fromFacebook, no other companies have collected as much data, and managed to   monetize it.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();But which is the better buy today? That's an impossible   question to answer, especially because geo-politics can play an   important role. Baidu operates almost entirely within the borders   of China, and is at the behest of the Chinese government. But   that alone shouldn't determine which is the better buy.Instead, we can get an idea for whatyouare more comfortable with by approaching the question through   three key lenses.Sustainable competitive advantagesAbsolutely nothing is more important to the long-term success   of an investment than the sustainable competitive advantage of   the underlying company you are investing in. Often referred to as   a ""moat"" in investing circles, this represents that specialsomethingthat separates a company from its competitors.Alphabet's moat began with Google's unique algorithm that spit   out search results faster and more accurately than any other   alternative. That algorithm was very popular; it's the reason we   ""Google"" for information, instead of ""Altavista"" it.But Google's moat is wider than that: The company has six   services in addition to search that have logged over 1 billion   users: Google Play, YouTube, Chrome, Android, Gmail, and Maps.   Combined, this ecosystem conveys two huge moats. First, Google   has more information on user habits than anyone else. This means   it can continually offer up products that people are looking for.   Other wannabe search engines don't have this data advantage, and   can never know for sure where the Next Big Product should be.Second, Google is slowly building out high switching costs.   Because users can sign into a dizzying array of sites today just   by being signed into their Google account, the switching costs to   another search engine have slowly crept up. Who wants to go back   and remember all those passwords if they decide against having a   Google account?Just about everything I just said about Google applies to   Baidu. Google has decided that it isn't going to compete actively   in China due to government intervention. Although Baidu has had   to deal with a few pesky upstarts, that decision has largely left   the Middle Kingdom to Baidu.Baidu has two additional variables worth mentioning. As stated   above, the ruling Communist Party in China can exert much more   control over Baidu than any other government could on Google, and   that's a risk worth considering. At the same time, because the   Chinese populace is entering the Age of the Internet much later   than Americans, Baidu is trying to capitalize on opportunities   Google missed stateside -- namely through creating an   Online-to-Offline (O2O) ecosystem, which you can read more abouthere.In the end, both companies have very wide moats.Winner: TieFinancial fortitudeI wouldn't be the least bit surprised to see both Alphabet and   Baidu start paying dividends before I retire (note: I'm 35 years   old now). For now, however, investors want to see cash being   poured into profitable new growth opportunities.But as exciting as those growth opportunities may be, the   companiesmustkeep a sizable cash stash on hand. That's because every company,   at some point, will have to endure difficult financial times.   Those that enter such times with cash have options: buy back   stock on the cheap, make a strategic acquisition, or -- perhaps   most important -- outspend rivals to gain market share.Debt-heavy companies are in the opposite situation, forced to   myopically focus on meeting their debt obligations. Keeping in   mind that Alphabet is valued at almostten timesthe size of Baidu, here's how the two stack up.CompanyCashDebtNet IncomeFree Cash FlowAlphabet$86 billion$4 billion$19.5 billion$25.8 billionBaidu$20 billion$5 billion$1.7 billion$2.6 billionData sources: Yahoo! Finance, SEC filings.Both of these companies are invery safepositions. Relative to its size, Baidu has much more cash, but   also carries much more debt. Net income and free cash flow are   about even, and very strong for both companies.Over a decades-long time horizon, I think both wouldbenefitfrom a downturn, as it would drive smaller players out of markets   where Alphabet and Baidu are working on offering ancillary   services or products.Winner: TieValuationFinally, we have valuation. While this isn't an exact science,   there are some straightforward metrics we can consult to give us   an idea of how expensive each stock is.CompanyP/EP/FCFP/SPEG RatioAlphabet25226.31.6Baidu38235.92.3Data sources: Yahoo! Finance, E*Trade, Nasdaq.com. P/E uses   figures from non-GAAP earnings.Here again we have a very close battle. While Baidu appears to   be much more expensive on an earnings basis, the companies are   virtually identical in terms of free cash flow -- a metric I give   more credence to.In terms of growth -- measured via the PEG Ratio -- Alphabet   trades at a 30% discount to Baidu. That's largely because   investments in O2O will be holding down Baidu's earnings for the   foreseeable future.While it's not a huge difference, we need a tiebreaker here,   and it will go to Alphabet.Winner: AlphabetThe winner is...So there you have it, by the thinnest of margins, Alphabet   comes out ahead. It has a more developed business line and more   favorable valuation. At the same time, Baidu's O2O aspirations   could prove to be an enormous boon to investors -- but it's just   too early to know for sure.As for myself, I have an enormous sum of money tied up inbothcompanies. Combined, they constitute 22% of my real-life   holdings. I believebothare worthy of your consideration.10 stocks we like better than Alphabet (A     shares)When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

This Virtual Reality Device Is Running Circles Around the Competition, New Survey Shows;4/14/2017;"Possibly no other consumer technology is getting as much   attention as virtual reality (VR) right now. Tech companies are   spending billions of dollars to develop new VR tech, or acquire   it, and some, likeFacebook(NASDAQ: FB) , believe that it could be the next major computing   platform.VR's market is poised to skyrocket over the next few years,   jumping from $13.9 billion in 2017 to an estimated $143.3 billion   in 2020. Part of this early growth will be fueled by VR headsets,   which are expected to hit worldwide sales of 200 million for the   six-year period ending in 2020, according to Tractica.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();All of these stats point to potentially good times ahead for   companies focusing on VR. The question, then, is which companies   are beginning to dominate the space. Arecent surveyreleased by ReportLinker sheds some light on the subject, and   shows thatSamsung's(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) Gear VR headset is already the most   recognizable VR headset among consumers, and shows no signs of   slowing down.All signs point to SamsungSamsung released its virtual reality headset, called the Gear   VR, back in 2015, and, according to ReportLinker, the company's   device is synonymous with virtual reality more than any other   company's offering.""More respondents quoted Samsung as a player in the new   virtual reality industry: three out of ten respondents   spontaneously mentioned the brand. There were less than 10% who   could, last September,"" the survey said.When respondents were asked which brand first came to mind   when thinking about virtual reality headsets, 28% named Samsung,   followed by just 11% forSony(NYSE: SNE) , 10% for Facebook's Oculus, 5% forAlphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google, and just 2% for HTC.And when asked which VR headset respondents had heard about,   survey respondents overwhelmingly chose Samsung's Gear VR. Take a   look:Image source:ReportLinker.Let's take a moment to recap these stats. Samsung's brand is   two times more recognizable for VR headsets than Sony or Oculus,   and consumers have heard of its Gear VR headset at nearly double   the rate that they've heard of the Oculus Rift or Google   Cardboard. In the consumer market, that's a slam dunk for   Samsung.Can Samsung sustain this lead?Nailing down why Samsung is the most recognizable VR brand and   why its Gear VR is the most well-known device isn't an exact   science. The ReportLinker survey suggests that increased   marketing efforts over this past holiday season were a major   factor:""With marketers' efforts and the availability of VR headsets   in stores before Christmas, more respondents were able to try   them, which explains better awareness of the VR technology and   brands,"" the survey said.Samsung may be benefiting the most because its Gear VR headset   launched over two years ago, which was earlier than both the   Oculus Rift and Sony's Playstation VR, though it launched after   Google's Cardboard. Samsung continues to aggressively market the   Gear VR, and has recently started giving away a free headset when   consumers pre-order its Galaxy S8 phone.The bigger question for Samsung and its competitors is if, and   when, VR will become profitable. Research firm IDC says that   software and services -- and not hardware -- will eventually   be the most profitable part of VR, but companies need to first   get hardware into people's hands, of course.Samsung might be dominating the VR headset name-recognition   space right now, but investors should also keep a close eye on   which companies are taking the lead in software and services. In   that light, Google, Facebook and Sony could prove to bebetter long-term buysin virtual reality.10 stocks we like better than SamsungWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Which Stock Is Better: Micron or Applied Materials?;4/13/2017;"With earnings season right around the corner, everyone will be waiting on the results and speculating on possible outcomes. Macro issues will retreat to the back of our consciousness as Wall Street warms up with all the news and views that constitute the typical earnings season.But this is a good time to take a look at some of the familiar names to see what they've been up to and where they are heading.First Up Is MicronMUMicron made strong gains in 2016 mainly because supply of DRAM and NAND memory chips was outstripped by demand for those devices, resulting in higher prices. So the share prices are essentially hanging on the expectation that this pricing strength will continue. In 2017, additional chip supply will be entering the market (especially 3D NAND, Intel'sINTC3D Xpoint, etc), so supply will increase. But new product launches will be consuming more memory than they did last year. So memory prices may not weaken.It's also worth keeping in mind that companies have been reducing their dependence on spot prices over the years although contract prices don't deviate too much from spot prices at the time the contract is signed meaning that pricing fluctuations are largely hedged today.As far as industry bit growth is concerned, Micron's own expectations are as follows:2017 DRAM Disk supply growth is expected to be 15-20% based on the assumption that natural supply growth will continue but suppliers will be more focused on process node migrations to enable cost reductions than on capacity adds. Micron's long-term bit demand growth forecast is approximately 20-25%.NAND bit growth is expected to be in the high 30% to low 40% range, which is in line with 2016. 3D conversions (75% of Micron's NAND will be 3D by year-end) offset by strong demand for storage and mobile solutions will lead to balanced supply/demand dynamics in 2017. Micron's long-term bit demand growth forecast is 40-45%.So this should be a good year for Micron. With a PEG ratio of just 0.74 and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), this is a stock worth buying.Other details:Revenue: Expected growth of 16.2% in the May quarter and 2.3% in the August quarter. Beat revenue estimates in 3 of the last 5 quarters.EPS: Expected growth of 77.9% in the May quarter and -1.5% in the August quarter. Topped earnings estimates in 4 of the last 5 quarters.Balance Sheet: This is not yet a concern but something to keep an eye on: from 1Q15 to date, the debt to total capital ratio has gone from 31.8% to 45.1% while the current ratio has moved from 2.19 to 1.91. Return on Assets is down from 18.6% to 3.7%.Investment Style: According to theZacks Style Score System, Micron has a Value Score of A, Growth Score of B and Momentum Score of A netting a VGM Score of A. This means that the stock is suitable for value, growth or momentum traders, as well as the layman with limited knowledge of these intricacies.Next, Applied MaterialsAMATThis is a very good time to be semiconductor equipment company, especially a well-managed one like Applied Materials. There are multiple drivers in the market right now, both with respect to new technologies (shrinking chip geometries, 3D NAND) coming online and the decision of the Chinese government to reduce is semiconductor imports by building domestic capabilities.3D involves etch and deposition-intensive layer stacking and better ion implantation and inspection, all of which are driving demand for better equipment.Since Chinese companies are yet to produce the equipment that can make the government's goal a reality, AMAT and Lam ResearchLRCX, the leading players, may be expected to become major suppliers of semiconductor equipment at least over the next 3-4 years.We should also keep in mind that as computing moves increasingly from PCs to mobile devices running on AlphabetGOOGL, AppleAAPLand MicrosoftMSFTsoftware, which have shorter life cycles, equipment replenishment cycles have shortened. With the advent of concepts like AI, IoT, self-driving and other automotive technologies, and AR/VR, there now appear to be several secular drivers that will drive equipment demand for years to come.That said, good growth is worth investing in only when the valuation isn't too high, and its heartening to see that this Zacks Rank #1 company has a PEG ratio of 0.94.Other details:Revenue: Expected decline of 22.4% in the April quarter and 7.2% in the July quarter. Beat revenue estimates in 3 of the last 5 quarters.EPS: Expected growth of 13.4% in the April quarter and decline of 13.2% in the July quarter. Topped estimates in all of the last 5 quarters.Balance Sheet: the debt to total capital ratio remains very manageable although it has increased from 19.4% to 28.9% from the first quarter of 2015 to date. The current ratio is only slightly lower during the same time frame from 2.75 to 2.39 while Return on Assets has jumped from 10.6% to 16.8%.Investment Style: According to the Zacks Style Score System, Applied Materials has a Value Score of C, Growth Score of B and Momentum Score of C netting a VGM Score of B. This stock is therefore most suitable for growth investors who have the stomach to invest today and wait for greater returns in the future.ConclusionThere are several positives to both stocks but since investment decisions depend on a lot of other factors including risk appetite and available funds.

"Dow 30 Stock Roundup: Microsoft Buys Cloud Tech Firm, Disney's ""Beauty and the Beast""";4/13/2017;"The index experienced an eventful and holiday shortened week, marked by growing geopolitical tensions. The index received a slight boost on Monday, primarily from energy shares, after U.S.oil pricesclosed at a one-month high. On Tuesday, the index slipped marginally following concerns over increase in geopolitical tensions including the U.S. attack on a Syrian air base and possible conflict with North Korea. These concerns flowed into Wednesday, leading to larger losses for the Dow.Last Week's PerformanceThe Dow declined marginally last Friday, dragged down by weaker-than-expected March jobs data and President Trump's surprise attack against an airbase near Homs, Syria. Jobs data showed an increase of 98,000 jobs in March, marking the smallest gain in almost a year. Moreover, New York Fed President William Dudley's comments hinting at a simultaneous rate hike along with Fed's plan to reduce its balance sheet, adversely affected the equity market.Over the last week, the index declined 0.03%. During the week, stocks suffered a setback after the release of minutes from the Federal Reserve. Weak auto sales data and a dip in manufacturing growth rate also had an adverse impact on the investor sentiments which eventually led the benchmarks to finish in the red.The DowThisWeekThe index gained marginally on Monday, boosted primarily by energy shares, which gained after U.S. oil prices closed at a one-month high. Gains in energy shares offset some geopolitical turmoil including U.S. attack on Syrian air base last Thursday. Meanwhile investors remained focus on bank earnings set to begin later this week. Financials declined as investors expressed concerns over lofty valuations of equities and raised doubts over Trump's ability to implement his pro-growth policies.The index declined a meagre 0.03% on Tuesday as investors remained concerned over increase in geopolitical tensions including the U.S. attack on a Syrian air base and possible conflict with North Korea. Investors remained focused on upcoming corporate earnings results while they also raised questions over Trump's ability to implement deregulation policies. Meanwhile, Trump's comments on revamping the Dodd-Frank law helped stocks pare losses.The index lost 0.3% on Wednesday as investors remained worried about rising geopolitical concerns including U.S. strike on a Syrian air base last week and escalating tension between U.S. and North Korea. The rise in geopolitical tensions led S&P 500 and Dow industrials to finish below their 50-day moving averages for the first time since November. The market's fear gauge touched a five-month high. Investors also kept close watch on the Presidential election in France.ComponentsMovingthe Index3M CompanyMMMhas over 109,000 patents in various categories across its product portfolio. Over the years, the company has successfully enforced its patent rights against unauthorized uses and filed legal suits against firms that infringed them. The latest of such litigations is a patent infringement suit against China-based manufacturing firm, Phoenix Automotive Refinishing and California-based marketing firm, K2 Concepts.In the lawsuit filed in the Central District of California, 3M alleged that Phoenix violated seven patents, manufacturing some automotive painting spray gun cup products in China and selling them in the U.S. through K2 Concepts.

Better Buy: Netflix, Inc. vs. Google;4/13/2017;"It's a battle of theFANG stocks.Digital video veteranNetflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) takes on online search and advertising giantAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) , best know for its Google-branded   operations. If you could only buy one of these today, which one's   the better choice?Let's find out.makeArticleAd();Image source: Google.The case for GoogleAlphabet is a deceptively simple business these days. The   Google segment stands for a staggering 99% of the umbrella   company's total sales, and all of its profits.Morethan all, actually -- the ""other bets"" division is still stuck   with negative operating profits.If you understand internet-based search and advertising, you   understand the current iteration of Alphabet. In that space,   Google holds unequaled market share and industry clout. Revenues   are soaring, free cash flow growth has accelerated in recent   quarters, and share prices more than doubled over the last three   years.GOOGLdata byYCharts.Business is good, but Alphabet will not fit that mold   forever.Search ads brought the company this far, building a massive   revenue base from which it can launch many new operations. Some   will fail and fade; others are sure to catch on and start   producing serious bottom-line profits. The best bets on the table   so far include theWaymoself-driving car platform, theCalicomedical research company, and an Internet of Things strategy   built around theNestline of smart home products.Alphabet is getting ready to go offline, becoming a   conglomerate of wildly different operations in the process.   That's how you build a business for the very, very long haul.Buy Alphabet if you don't want to worry about the ""sell""   button for several decades.Image source: Netflix.The case for NetflixUnlike Alphabet, Netflix can't boast solid bottom-line results   quite yet. Earnings are barely positive, cash flows are diving   deep into red ink, and the stock is incredibly overvalued by   nearly every traditional metric.Yet, I heartily recommend investors take a closer look at   Netflix. All is not as it seems.The company announced and then executed a global rollout,   installing streaming video services in nearly every nation on   Earth. China remains a difficult nut to crack, and American   businesses simply can't work in embargoed territories like North   Korea and Syria, so it's not quite 100% coverage. Still, that   ambitious, market-growing project is essentially complete.   Without the budget pressures of a worldwide service installation   to worry about, Netflix's management has promised to increase its   bottom-line earnings in 2017 and beyond.Granted, cash flows will stay negative for a few more years.   That's a side effect of the company's massive content production   plans. The company has financed its production budget via new   debt in recent years, and it will probably hit the debt market   again in 2017 and 2018.But look at what Netflix will have built, just a couple of   years down the road. A global content distribution network will   be married to a first-class entertainment studio, creating a   two-pronged video entertainment attack like nothing we've seen   before. Meanwhile, the portion of humanity that has access to   Netflix-grade network connections is growing explosively. Netflix   hopes to establish itself as the player to beat in an expanding   market, kind of like the Google we knew 15 years ago.The cash investments Netflix is making now are building an   impressive content portfolio for the long run, which will   continue to bring in and hold onto paying customers for years to   come.This is the stock to pick if you're looking for exciting   growth in the next 5 to 10 years. Beyond that, I have no idea   where Netflix will go.Image source: Getty Images.Two winnersLet me be clear: There are no bad choices, here. It's the   ultimate cop-out, but I'll stand by it. Alphabet and Netflix are   two fine long-term investments, but also dramatically different   ones.I own both and plan to hold them for many more years. Netflix   may need some attention in, say, 2025, as the mature company   enters a new era. I could probably leave Alphabet leave alone   until my kids graduate from elementary school, grow up, and   retire.So, I understand that your mileage might vary, and Netflix   certainly offers the bumpier ride.

Netflix (NFLX) Stock Isn’t Feeling Heat From YouTube’s Free Service;4/13/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhile news that YouTube is now available on 53% of set-up boxes may haveAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL) fans excited,Netflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX) doesn't seem fazed by it. You can see it in the price action: since the data points hit the market early Monday morning, NFLX stock is up 0.9% while GOOGL is down 0.2%.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockJust about every firm on Wall Street covers both of these companies with microscopic precision, so if these numbers budged the competitive map, we would have seen a bigger reaction.That said, the logic behind Wall Street's yawn does tell us important things abouthow post-cable TV is evolving.For one, a network-driven alternative to what's on cable has grown beyond niche to normal, with 53% of U.S. households now pushing network video straight to their screen. That's a great inflection point in terms of market penetration: big enough to qualify as a lot more than a fad but with almost enough room left to double its audience one more time.TV is big business, limited only by the amount of time we spend viewing it. With 96% of the population still watching the conventional cable box, companies selling alternative programming can capture plenty of viewer minutes and starve their rivals. NFLX reaches 75% of the streaming audience, so 56% of the overall TV audience remains wide open to expansion.I suspect the company will keep nibbling at that market or even discount the service to take bigger bites if management decides scale is more important than profitability. Either way, every one of those viewers pays NFLX the same monthly fee no matter how many hours they stream - even if they don't use the service at all.NFLX Subscribers Want to PayThe YouTube model is very different. Simply being available on the big household screen doesn't automatically generate a lot of free cash flow and it doesn't really compete with NFLX or other pay-TV channels. YouTube original programming - the ""Red"" Lineup of shows - hasn't exactly made a big impact at $9.99 a month.Beyond that thin slice, the site's content is still overwhelmingly user-generated and available for free. GOOGL gets ad revenue when those videos play via set-top boxes, but NFLX signs subscribers who want to pay.10 Hopeless Stocks to Wash From Your Portfolio ForeverAlmost every one of those 58 million NFLX households pays. Only 1.5 million of the 34 million YouTube households have upgraded to Red. The rest may drain a few minutes from Netflix and rack up a little ad revenue, but a show more or less isn't really going to change the dynamics much at all.As it is, NFLX is chewing up about an hour a day of a subscriber's viewing time, locking those blocks off from competitors who need the eyeballs.The Real CompetitorsI believe the real competitors here areAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) and other monthly subscription models like Sling and Hulu, not to mention traditional TV like TimeWarner Cable Inc's(NYSE:TWC) HBO.AMZN is coming up fast, and it's easy to imagine scenarios where subscribers looking to trim their budgets will have to choose one service or the other. I don't think that's happening yet - Amazon Prime plus NFLX streaming is $19 a month compared to an average cable TV bill above $100, so cable cutters can keep both options open, watch all day and it's the cable companies that suffer.This is perhaps another golden age of television - or maybe we call it video. People will chase whatever they like at price points they can afford.Right now, the ""free"" option YouTube supports hasn't cut all that deeply into pay-for-play, which means NFLX stock is a long way from feeling any heat.Hilary Kramer is the editor ofGameChangers,Breakout Stocks,High Octane Trader,Absolute Capital ReturnandValue Authority.

3 Big Stock Charts for Thursday: Apple Inc. (AAPL), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) and Whiting Petroleum Corp (WLL);4/13/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsEarnings season hits the financial sector today and investors don't seem awfully impressed as banking stocks are trading about a half percent lower while the remainder of the market trades flat. Traders and chart watchers should expect some lighter trading in the afternoon today as many will get an early start on the holiday weekend.makeArticleAd();Today's three big stock charts takes a look at two stocks in bearish transitions,JPMorgan Chase & Co.(NYSE:JPM) andWhiting Petroleum Corp(NYSE:WLL) as well as one big company that is showing potential for a short-term bull run,Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL).JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)Despite some positive earnings, JP Morgan stock is only treading water this morning as the stock is basically flat. We've been covering some of the financials ahead of earnings as the technical tide has been turning on these stocks.For JPM, the concern will be a move below $85. Per the chart, this represents two key technical items.First, the stock's lower Bollinger Band is trading just below this level. A break of this band on a closing basis will cause a volatility sell-off for JP Morgan that would likely target $82 with haste.The 11 Best Dividend Stocks to BuySecond, $85 marks the March lows when technical traders defended JPM stock after its last break of the bottom Bollinger Band. The market doesn't like to see round-numbered levels that had previously been defended broken, it turns them into sellers fast.JP Morgan shares do have the fact that the current RSI reading is starting to indicate that the shares are oversold. Picking up on this, we point out that these oversold signals are more bullish when JPM stock has seen a sharp decline, not a slow and steady one like it has had lately.Apple Inc. (AAPL)Apple made the headlines this morning with a note circulating that the stock could potentially targetWalt Disney Co(NYSE:DIS) as an acquisition to increase their content business. The idea is clearly more of a novelty to traders, who haven't bid the price higher or lower on the news.After topping out around $145, AAPL stock has been slowly declining with the market as investors appear to be taking a wait-and-see approach to how earnings season may take hold of stocks.The chart of Apple stock is relatively unexciting, except if things lead to a price that is just slightly lower than $140.According to the charts, $140 has been a significant level for the bulls when it comes to ""buying the dip"" as each touch of that price has seen an increase in buying volume since early March.Additionally, AAPL stock's 50-day moving average is creeping higher and will soon intersect with the $140 price point, building what we refer to as ""double barreled"" support.The bottom line is that we usually see Apple shares rise ahead of their earnings announcement. The company is slated to release their next earnings on May 4. Putting that together with the support we see building at $140, it appears that AAPL stock is ripe for a ""buy the rumor"" surge over the next few weeks.Whiting Petroleum Corp (WLL)Oil and gas stocks will start to hit the tape with their earnings results over the next few weeks. In general, higher oil prices have helped this sector, but there are still some laggards in the group.  Whiting Petroleum is one of them.Why Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Is STILL Easy MoneyWLL shares snapped through their 200-day moving average during trading yesterday and are tacking another losing day so far this morning. The 200-day is only part of the problem. Selling volume for Whiting has been on the rise along with volatility recently as traders are clearly losing faith in the stock after it broke back below the $10-level. For the most part, traders start to shy away from single-digit stocks like WLL.One more pressure point for shares of Whiting is the declining 50-day moving average, which itself is now trading below $10 too. History shows that a declining 50-day paints a bearish intermediate-term picture for a stock over the next two to three months.Based on our analysis of the chart, traders should expect to see an $8 print on shares of WLL before the bulls give it a go again.As of this writing, Johnson Research Group did not hold a positition in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 Hopeless Stocks to Wash From Your Portfolio Forever10 Blue-Chip Stocks That Will Bleed for the Rest of 2017The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for 2017: Still the Best?The post3 Big Stock Charts for Thursday: Apple Inc.

Why Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Is STILL Easy Money;4/13/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe decision by managers atYahoo! Inc.(NASDAQ:YHOO), in 1997, to listen to Wall Street and become ""more than a search engine"" will go down in history as the biggest mistake in the history of American business. Bigger than the Red Sox selling Babe Ruth. Bigger than Western Union ignoring the telephone. Today, 20 years later, the company that focused on what computers do rather than people has more opportunity than it knows what to do with.Alphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), the artists formerly known as Google, will report first-quarter earnings on April 27 andanalysts are expecting a hiccup.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockThe consensus on GOOGL stock is for net income of $7.24 per share on revenues of $19.31 billion.The top line for Alphabet will fall almost $1 billion short of last year's figure, but the bottom line will be almost 20% richer, with more than $1 in every $4 coming down to the net income line. Yet that's a down quarter.GOOGL Stock: The Downside of Self ServiceThe key to Alphabet's success is self-service. You don't talk to GOOGL before buying their search service, you just type (or talk). You don't talk to Alphabet before buying their advertising, you just buy it online. Clouds scale to infinity and beyond, and with its niche secure, the company is a money-making machine you can't turn off.Like a trust fund baby, everything GOOGL touches turns to gold. Making certain it doesn't color too far out of the lines is its ""evil"" stepmother, chief financial officer Ruth Porat, who cut off the company's allowance for things like the self-driving car, and demanded such ""side bets"" be revealed to shareholders so they might pay their own way. I like Wall Street's evil stepmother, very much.The 11 Best Dividend Stocks to BuyThere is a downside to all this. Alphabet treats its algorithms like an oil well that can't run dry. Gender discrimination can creep into the companywithout its even knowing it.Ads may appearwhere they shouldn't.I warned about thislast monthbut until an algorithm is written to address it effectively,it won't be dealt with.Then, when you think the company is running into trouble, a new bright, shiny object will appear to make the trouble magically go away. In the world of GOOGL stock, there are many such objects.Many Shiny Objects for AlphabetVoice is a shiny object, and GOOGL is working hard tomonetize it.Virtual reality is a shiny object, and Alphabet isworking to make it mass market.By automating the production of ""Pinterest"" image boards, even Google Images can beturned into a money machine.Some 90% of the world's smartphonesrun Google's Android, notApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) iOS. Google Chromebooks now outsell the Macintosh PC and areresponsible for what growth there isin that sector. The cloud itself is a shiny object, and just byputting someone with a clue in charge of it,GOOGL stock is worrying its ""friends"" atAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN).The Bottom Line on GOOGL StockWhile Alphabet shares are up just 6% year-to-date and 9% over the last year, the market's worries have made them into a bargain. The non-voting GOOG shares now have a price-to-earnings ratio of 28.6, which is lower thanMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT), lower thanFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) and less than half that ofRestaurant Brands International Inc(NYSE:QSR), which owns Burger King.As much as I may worry about the company, owning GOOGL stock is the easiest hold in the history of Earth. Without even paying attention to it, my Alphabet shares have become the best-performing piece of my portfolio. Self-service is not going to disappear, and before things get too bad on any front the people at Google will wake up long enough to address them.GOOGL stock is easy money.Dana Blankenhornis a financial and technology journalist.

This means it has raised at least $115.5 million so far at a valuation of roughly $940 million. Yext initially priced its debut between $8 and $10 per share.Founded in 2006, Yext is a New York-based tech company that helps other businesses manage their listing on directory sites like YelpYELP, FacebookFB, Alphabet'sGOOGLGoogle Maps, and Foursquare.

Facebook's Messenger App Crosses 1.2B Monthly Active Users;4/13/2017;"With each passing day,Facebook Inc.FBis achieving a new milestone. The global social networking giant yesterday revealed that its home grown chat platform - Messenger - has crossed the 1.2 billion monthly active users (MAU) mark, roughly the same as WhatsApp which achieved this milestone two months ago.The 1.2 billion mark represents over 100% growth from approximately 600 MAU base in Mar 2015. Earlier in July last year, the company had announced that its MAU have doubled from Nov 2014 and touched the 1 billion milestone.Messenger is Facebook's third platform, with over 1.2 billion MAU. Facebook's fast growing MAUs reflect the popularity of all its apps including WhatsApp, Messenger and Instagram.  We note that these are far more popular than rival social media apps like TwitterTWTRand SNAP Inc.'sSNAPSnapchat.The Messenger platform has been witnessing tremendous surge in its active user base after Facebook split it off and created a standalone company in 2014. Since the split, the platform has added various useful features like voice calling, individual and group video calling, stickers, frames, etc. which helped in expanding its user base.Most recently, Facebook introduced artificial intelligence (AI) powered voice assistant, M for Messenger, which will help users with suggestions to improve their communication experience on the app. For the time being, Suggestions from M will be available to users across the U.S., with global launch in the near term.Furthermore, the company in February this year, partnered with TransferWise Ltd., an international money transfer service, that will enable users to make international transactions over the Messenger app. Notably, in Sep 2016, Messenger provided tools to developers, enabling 'bots' to accept and make payments within the U.S., thereby eliminating the need to redirect to an external website.Messenger's consistent growth in user base has heated the debate that Facebook should now make efforts to monetize the platform. The social media platform too is aggressively working on monetizing the opportunities presented by its subsidiaries. Chatbots and ""conversational commerce"" are likely to be the strategies for Messenger.Various analysts believe that it will be wise for Facebook to ramp up the monetizing experiment on Messenger rather than trying on the WhatsApp platform. This is so because Facebook's balance sheet carries a hefty amount of goodwill related to the WhatsApp acquisition and if the experiment fails it will impact the company's financials badly. However, attempting the same on Messenger will not carry such risks for the company as it is Facebook's in-house developed chat platform.Therefore, in our opinion, the company should look for options to generate ad revenues from Messenger as the competition for ad dollars from the likes of Alphabet'sGOOGLYouTube, Twitter and Snapchat has been intensifying rapidly.Notably, ad revenues contribute over 95% to Facebook's total revenue. Continuous rise in advertising revenues as well as the company's strategic efforts to sustain the growth momentum has put Facebook on investors' favorite stock pick list. Notably, in the past one year, Facebook's shares generated a return of 26% compared with the ZacksInternet Servicesindustry's return of just 5%.At present, Facebook carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Report: Apple Inc. Is Making an Apple Watch for Diabetics (AAPL);4/13/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsApple(NASDAQ:AAPL) is reportedly working on a top secret project that would incorporate blood glucose monitoring technology for the Apple Watch. The ability to check and monitor blood sugar levels without the need to use a needle to physically draw blood would be a medical game changer.makeArticleAd();Source: AppleAn Apple Watch for diabetics would also make AAPL's wearable a must-have for hundreds of millions of people.Diabetes: A Big Problem That's Getting BiggerDiabetes is a chronic disease that's on the upswing. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), modern lifestyles with relatively little activity and increasing body weight is to blame for the majority of cases of Type 2 Diabetes - the most common version. The number of people affected is rapidly growing, with WHO reporting the108 million cases globally rose to 422 million by 2014.Managing diabetes requires regular monitoring of blood glucose levels throughout the day, which means using a needle to prick a finger for blood needed for testing. That also means buying a blood testing monitor and ongoing purchases of testing strips.Few people like being pricked with a needle multiple times every day.10 Hopeless Stocks to Wash From Your Portfolio ForeverAn Apple Watch for Diabetics would upend the entire blood glucose monitoring process, making it easier, far less invasive and eliminating the ongoing cost of supplies.The Team Working on an Apple Watch for DiabeticsCNBCbroke the news thatAAPL has a secret teamworking to develop sensors that can continuously monitor blood sugar levels -without having to draw blood. The project is focused on optical sensors that would shine through the skin to measure blood glucose levels. This sensor would be integrated into the bottom of the Apple Watch - in a similar fashion to the current model's optical heart rate sensor.The resulting Apple Watch for diabetics would have the potential to be a game-changer in how the disease is managed.According toCNBC's sources, this project isn't pie in the sky. In the past year, AAPL has reportedly been adding biomedical experts from medical corporations to the initial team of 30 engineers. It is conducting trials at clinical sites in the San Francisco area, and has hired consultants to work on the regulatory requirements.What This Could Mean for Apple Watch SalesThe impact of integrated blood glucose monitoring on Apple Watch sales would be huge. The Centers for Disease Control says that in 2016,29 million Americans had diabetesand 86 million were pre-diabetic.No one enjoys needles, and while an Apple Watch for diabetics wouldn't eliminate the need for insulin shots, itwouldeliminate the finger pricking to draw blood for testing multiple times per day. It also would eliminate the need to carry around the blood glucose testing kit and the ongoing purchase of testing strips.Constant blood glucose monitoring could also help those 86 million Americans realize they are pre-diabetic and help them to manage their lifestyle to prevent the onset of full-blown diabetes.There Are HurdlesThe biggest issue facing Apple - aside from actually developing a reliable blood glucose sensor- is regulatory. Apple has been able to get away with the Apple Watch heart rate sensor because it does not market its wearable as a medical device. But this move would bring the Apple Watch under U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulation.That in turn could disrupt release cycles, as AAPL would likely need FDA approval before making any changes.3 Reasons Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Is Still a Top BuyNaturally, there is competition. After all, diabetes management is a hugely profitable target.Alphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL) has been working on asmart contact lens project since 2014. This involves embedded glucose sensors, but has yet to result in a commercial product.Apple Watch sales have been fine, but not spectacular. The company remains firmly in the lead for smartwatch sales, and has made concerted effort to steer its wearable more into health and fitness territory, with a resulting sales bump - in Q4 2016 it sold a record 4.6 million units.But add constant blood glucose monitoring making it an Apple Watch for diabetics and for the tens of millions of Americans who are concerned about monitoring their health for signs of diabetes onset?Thatcould be the feature that finally turns Apple Watch into a ""must-have"" device, with hundreds of millions of people globally who would suddenly have a real reason to want to buy one.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceApple Inc.

Yes, even the history major, non-finance Millennials are interested. No, they're not buying ETFs.They like stocks that are highly volatile and have room to the upside such as the social media stocks or the biotechs.They also invest in what they know.As Parth said, ""Millennials like to have something in their hands"" so that means when they invest, they like to know, and most likely, love, the company they are buying. They are emotional investors.It's not surprising, then, that companies that feature prominently in Millennials lives are also among the more popular stocks.What Are Millennials Buying?1. The Snapchat IPO (NYSE:SNAP-Free Report) was big among the younger Millennials. They are the original users of the product so they know it inside and out.2. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB-Free Report) skews older but Millennials grew up using it. They cannot imagine a world without it so they also like the stock.3. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA-Free Report) is another popular stock, not because they can afford to buy one of the cars, but because they like to think they can in the future. They like to buy stock in companies they believe in.4. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL-Free Report) owns one of the most popular brands in the world, YouTube, but Millennial investors aren't really buying the stock. Why not? Tracey asked Parth and Ryan why Alphabet is left out in the cold.Where Do Millennials Get Their News?Millennials have short attention spans. They like to read headlines. But Millennial traders still need to get their financial news somewhere.Tracey was surprised to find out the top source of financial news for Millennials. You won't believe it either. Tune in!What other issues are on the minds of Millennials about stocks and investing?Find out the answer to this and more on this week's podcast.Zacks' Top 10 Stocks for 2017makeArticleAd();In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2017?Who wouldn't?

The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights: Apple, Alphabet, Amazon.com and Facebook;4/13/2017;"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL - April 13, 2017 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog includeApple(NASDAQ:AAPL-Free Report),Alphabet Inc.(NASDAQ:GOOGL-Free Report),Amazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN-Free Report) andFacebook, Inc.(NASDAQ:FB-Free Report).Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations.Get #1Stock of the Day pick for free.Here are highlights from Wednesday's Analyst   Blog:Apple (AAPL) or Alphabet (GOOGL): Which Is Better?After a ho-hum fourth-quarter earnings season, investors are on the edge of their seats for the first quarter of this year. The beginning of 2017 was difficult for tech companies as they were exposed to risk of trade wars and the anti-immigration stance.However, the tech sector had a relatively good run against a tough macroeconomic backdrop. Advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) technology, breakthroughs in chip-shrinking technology, self-driving cars, personal assistants, high-speed Internet and home automation kept the buzz surrounding the sector alive.Moreover, as the global economy is gaining momentum, technology companies appear to be in the best position to prosper. They are also less susceptible to interest rates or deregulation. Among sector bellwethers, mega-cap tech names like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL-Free Report) have surged this year, along with Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL-Free Report) Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN-Free Report) and Facebook, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB-Free Report).Here's a look at the performance of both the companies in the last quarter and what awaits them in the to-be reported quarter.AppleApple Inc. emerged the top gainer for the Dow during the first quarter. Since the last earnings reported by Apple, its shares have added about 8.6%, outperforming the market.Apple reported better-than-expected first quarter of fiscal 2017 results. Earnings of $3.36 per share and revenues of $78.4 billion easily topped the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.22 and $76.9 billion. On a year-over-year basis, both metrics registered growth of 2.4% and 3.3%.A variety of factors contributed to the stock's gain, including a rebound in iPhone sales growth, investments made by Warren Buffet and the company's efforts to boost its services revenue. Apple has expanded its market capitalization by more than $140 billion over the period, an amount which is higher than the gains mopped by all other Dow components taken together.Apple Looks GoodApple, a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) technology stock, generated a strong three-month return of around 18.86%. The company has a market cap of $743.07 billion. It has a VGM score of A.The stock delivered three positive earnings surprises in the last four quarters with an average beat of 0.89%. Moreover, in the last 30 days, three estimates for fiscal 2017 were raised upward, pushing the Zacks Consensus Estimate up by 0.34% (3 cents) to $8.94.One of the biggest catalysts for Apple this quarter could be the performance of the iPhone as always. Apple plans to introduce its customary updated versions of the iPhone with the release of the tentatively named iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus. Besides the new iPhone offerings, the best news for Apple and its investors is the massively aging iPhone install-user base.Stock performanceComing to the stock performance, shares of Apple performed more or less in line with the broader ZacksComputer - Mini Computersindustry in the last one year. While the industry gained 27.31%, the stock returned 26.29%The in-line performance of the stock can primarily be attributed to good growth in its services revenues, especially with regard to Apple Music and App Store. However, the company is witnessing sluggish demand for its flagship offering, the iPhone in major markets worldwide. Also, intensifying competition and macroeconomic headwinds remain concerns for the company.AlphabetAs usual, all eyes will be on the company formerly known as Google, Alphabet Inc., as the tech giant prepares to release its first-quarter earnings. The company missed its fourth-quarter earnings by 1.18%.Higher cost of revenue and steeper taxes impacted the quarter's earnings. Since the last earnings reported by Alphabet, its shares have lost about 0.6%.However, YouTube continues to remain a strong contributor benefiting from the increase in online video consumption. More than a thousand creators are currently engaged with the platform, bringing in a thousand subscribers every day.Also, Google gained strength in the mobile platform. Management is focused on driving mobile experiences and the company is well positioned to pick up strong intent-to-buy signals as a result of studying mobile searches from its huge database. As a result, revenue from mobile platform is expected to increase in the upcoming results.Also, Google platforms like Android, Chrome and Daydream continue to help it draw more users and sell more ads.Alphabet Not Far BehindAlphabet, on the other hand, also carries a Zacks Rank #2, and that's always a good sign heading into an earnings announcement.Alphabet generated a return of 0.99% in the last three months. The company has a market cap of 573.85 billion.Ahead of the report, Alphabet Inc. has seen one positive estimate revision in the last 60 days. Our current consensus estimates indicate earnings per share growth of 19.52% and sales growth of 19.32%. This helped the company to earn a ""B"" grade for growth. This is especially noteworthy given the relative size and status of Alphabet already.The stock delivered two positive earnings surprises in the last four quarters with an average beat of 2.71%. Nevertheless, Alphabet currently has an Earnings ESP of 0.0%, which makes surprise prediction a bit more difficult.Stock performanceComing to the stock performance, over the past one year, shares of Alphabet have been steadily treading higher. The stock returned 8.72% compared with the Zacks categorizedInternet Servicesindustry's gain of 5.73%.Bottom LineApple and Alphabet are two of the biggest companies in the tech space. Both stocks have their share of positives and negatives. While Apple has been a steady performer, Google is in for some tough competition, which will likely unfold over the next five years or so. Both have strong balance sheets, ample financial flexibility, manageable debt capital ratios and strong shareholder return policies in place along with sound management.But given the current scenario, we would bet on Apple because it is well-positioned to outpace the industry and is fundamentally strong enough to withstand risks.You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks   here.Zacks' Best Private Investment IdeasWhile we are happy to share many articles like this on the website, our best recommendations and most in-depth research are not available to the public.

Here’s How to Capitalize on Facebook Inc (FB) Ahead of Earnings;4/13/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThere are plenty of options strategies for traders to consider holding through an earnings announcement, and we will talk about some of those in future posts. But there is also a strategy to consider that is meant to be closed out prior to earnings that most options traders are probably familiar with - buying a straddle or strangle ahead of earnings.makeArticleAd();Source:Via Stock SnapLet's take a look below what a straddle and strangle is, in case you are not familiar with them.Keeping it fairly simple, both a straddle and strangle consist of buying both a call and put with the same expiration date and on the same security. A straddle is buying a call and put at the same strike price, and a strangle is buying them for two different strike prices. For the most part, one is chosen over the other based on how close the underlying stock is trading to a particular strike price.There are different ways in which to profit - either from delta (changes in option premium based on direction), vega (changes in option premium based on volatility) or both.Since both a call and put are purchased, it is beneficial for the stock to move distinctly in one direction. Then you will have either positive or negative delta and the trade will benefit from a continued move in the direction of the delta.10 Hopeless Stocks to Wash From Your Portfolio ForeverUp and down action is not beneficial usually.Vega effects option premium based on the implied volatility. Options increase in price when IV rises and vice versa. Since the position is long a call and put, it is beneficial for IV to increase.There are several companies that are expected to announce next week, includingNetflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX). But this strategy can work best when there are a couple of weeks left until the expected announcement. EnterFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB). The company is expected to announce quarterly earnings on May 3.Lawrence Meyersjust recently wrote about Facebook stock and how he now considers it to be investment-worthy and he notes how digital advertising is being dominated by FB andAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL). Will the stock rise ahead of earnings because of a perceived value or will this uncertain market pull the stock lower after a months-long run higher?An Option Straddle Idea to Consider on FB StockThe Rationale:The plan for buying a straddle or strangle based on earnings is to put the position on ahead of earnings and exit the position (hopefully for a profit) before the actual announcement. Of course, the position can be held over the announcement, but a big move is probably needed to profit because the IV will drop - and so will the option premiums - after the announcement.Although past performance is not indicative of future behavior, it might be beneficial to look at a stock's previous earnings to gauge if it may be a good candidate. Take a look at a one-year chart of FB stock below. The stock has moved fairly well prior to the announcement several times in the past.Click to EnlargeThe goal is for the stock to move decisively before the actual announcement. Consider buying the position anywhere from about a month to about a week prior to the announcement. Remember time decay (theta) is a concern, so be sure to allow enough time and maybe not just pick the expiration that takes place right after the expected announcement.What usually benefits this pre-earnings position is vega. Since implied volatility (IV) generally rises as the earnings date nears, option premiums should rise as well minus any time decay. If the stock moves decidedly higher or lower after the position is put on and IV increases, it is a win-win for the position. Consider managing the position for profit based on an expected return goal like a certain percentage. Consider managing the position on the stop-loss side of things based on two criteria: an exit at a certain point (like before the announcement) and/or a certain percentage of risk, just like you may for profit.Should You Buy Netflix, Inc. (NFLX) Stock Ahead of Earnings?The Trade:Buy the May $140 call and the May $140 put for $9 or less.The Strategy:The maximum profit on a straddle is theoretically unlimited because the stock can continue to rise up until expiration and pretty much fall to zero. The maximum loss is $9, or whatever was paid for the straddle, if FB stock finishes right at $140 at May expiration. Both options would expire worthless. There are two breakeven points at expiration; $131 to the downside and $149 to the upside based on a cost of $9.John Kmiecik is the head options instructor for Market Taker Mentoring, and co-author of the eBook 3 Secrets to Making Money in Any Market.

TiVo Inc (TIVO) Enters into Licensing Agreement with Roku;4/13/2017;"makeZacksArticleAd();Digital home entertainment services and solutions provider,TiVo Inc.TIVO, recently entered into a licensing and multi-year intellectual property agreement with Roku, Inc. However, the financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.Per the deal, Roku now has a license to TiVo and Rovi Corporation patent portfolios for over-the-top (OTT) offerings. Additionally, the contract entitles customers of Roku to directly access TiVo's high-quality entertainment metadata and other products to carry on search and navigating user interface.California-based Roku is a privately held consumer electronics company, primarily dealing in consumer digital media products. Its digital media receivers allow customers to stream video or audio via Internet on televisions. It offers both fee-based and free services to its customers.According to Samir Armaly, executive vice president of TiVo, ""This license agreement with Roku underscores the importance of TiVo's comprehensive patent portfolios for the fast-growing streaming entertainment industry.""We believe that an agreement through this licensing deal would be incrementally beneficial for the company. Additionally, the deal would provide the necessary competitive edge.Going forward, TiVo's strategy of including Roku makes its service more ambitious. It is expected that this inclusion will bring more users to TiVo and drive the sales of TiVo's other digital goods. Therefore, the deal could help the company gain larger market share.Bottom LineWe believe that recent deals with leading companies coupled with new customer wins, product launches and international expansion will drive top-line growth.It should be noted that TiVo was formerly known as Rovi Corporation. Upon successfully completing the acquisition of TiVo Inc. early this September, Rovi adopted the iconic TiVo brand name.The new TiVo Corporation is now the global leader in entertainment technology and audience insights. The company has a diverse product portfolio ranging from interactive program guide to DVR. The combined company has emerged as the world's leading media and entertainment provider.Nonetheless, the actual synergies from the merger will take some time to reflect in the company's performance and a lot depends on how successfully it integrates the legacy business of TiVo.The company faces significant competition from Alphabet Inc.'sGOOGLGoogle TV, Roku and Apple Inc.'sAAPLTV.Shares of TiVo underperformed the ZacksInternet Servicesindustry over the last six months. TiVo's shares registered a negative return of 5.96% compared with the industry's 1.02% gain.Currently, TiVo carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).

Why Apple Is Beating (and Will Keep Beating) Google in Mobile Payments;4/13/2017;"The smartphone market has historically been dominated by   Google's Android.In the most recent quarter, theAlphabet, Inc(NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG)  property controlled more   than 80% of the global mobile operating system market. You might   be tempted to believe that the company would be able to leverage   its massive installed base of devices into a commanding lead in   the area of mobile payments. While that would be an easy   conclusion to draw, it's not actually the case.WhenApple Inc.(NASDAQ: AAPL) launched Apple Pay in 2014, it announced that the   payment service was supported byVisa,Mastercard, andAmerican Express(which represented 83% of credit card purchases in the   U.S.) and was accepted at 220,000 merchant locations. One of the   criticisms at the time was that the seemingly large number only   represented about 2.4% of the approximately 8 million merchants   in the U.S. that accepted credit cards. Apple touted its NFC   antenna technology as groundbreaking, but the vast majority of   merchants didn't possess the point-of-sale systems the would work   with this technology. But from these humble beginnings and early   criticisms, Apple has emerged as the leader in the mobile   payments space.makeArticleAd();Image source: Getty Images.Apple Pay transaction volume up 500%During its most recent conference call, Apple revealed   that the number of Apple Pay users had more than tripled over the   last year and that transaction volume was up 500% year over year.   The service has been rolled out in four new countries, for a   total of 13. Apple admitted that while adoption has been slow, 4   million locations that cover about 35% of all retail stores in   the U.S. now accept Apple Pay. Since Apple collects a piece of   each transaction, this could eventually generate a significant   ongoing revenue stream for the company.A recent report by Statista revealed similar findings, with   about 36% of U.S. retailers accepting Apple Pay. Google takes up   the second spot with Android Pay, which is accepted at 24% of   merchants, andSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) offering Samsung Pay comes in third with 18%.   Apple Pay's acceptance at a significantly greater number of   merchants appears to be paying off, and is likely the reason   for Apple's lead in the category.Monthly Apple Pay transactions grew 50%While one-off payments help growth, regular use will be a key   driving factor. Consumer analytics firm TXN Solutionsreviewedthe transactions from over 3 million payments and reported that   the number of monthly Apple Pay transactions grew by 50% between   December 2015 and December 2016.How does this translate to overall consumer usage? Market   research firm eMarketerrevealedthat fewer than 20% of smartphone users have paid using a mobile   device in the preceding six months. That is expected to grow to   33% by 2020. Statista found that Apple Pay leads among consumers,   with 12% using the service, while only 9% use Android Pay and 6%   use Samsung Pay.Apple leads in the growing mobile payments segment. Image     source: Pixabay.Mobile payments slowly gaining popularityWith the wide adoption of smartphones, many expected that   mobile payments would gain fast acceptance, but thus far it has   been slow to materialize. Numerous factors including concerns   regarding personal data security and the potential for fraud have   contributed to the slow rate of adoption by consumers. Still,   Statistaexpectsmobile payment transactions to grow at a rate of 52% annually to   $866 billion by 2021.The2016 North America Consumer Digital Payments   Survey(link opens PDF) byAccentureConsulting indicates that while consumers still default to   traditional payments now, many report that they expect to making   more digital payments by 2020. Several key trends are at play   that will drive further mobile payment adoption. Fifty-six   percent of consumers are aware of the technology and plan to use   it in coming years. Millennials (those the report defines as   being between the ages of 18 and 34) and mass affluents (those   consumers with annual income of $100,000 or more after taxes) are   pioneering the change to digital payments, with 35% of these   groups regularly using their mobile phone to make online   payments. This bodes well for Apple, as market research firmMBLMin its Brand Intimacy Report found that Apple is one of themost beloved brands among millennials. Finally, 73% of consumers trust their traditional credit card   providers the most when considering mobile payments, which again   bodes well for Apple Pay as it pairs with existing credit   cards.Part of a growing trendApple doesn't break out the revenue generated by Apple Pay,   though its services segment, where it is located, reached a   record $7.17 billion in the first quarter of 2017, up 18% over   the prior-year quarter. Apple revealed in its most recent   conference call that more than 2 million small businesses now   accept invoice payments using Apple Pay and thatComcastwould soon as well. CEO Tim Cook said the company's goal is to   double revenue from the services segment by the end of 2020.The acceptance of Apple Pay by a larger segment of retailers   appears to have resulted in greater popularity for its service.   That doesn't mean the company can rest on its laurels. Last   month, Samsung launched Samsung Pay in India, the world's second   most populous country, ahead of both Apple Pay and Android Pay,   and LG announced that it would debut its own mobile payments   service in June.The field is becoming more crowded, but Apple is clearly the   top dog in mobile payments, and it has plenty of tailwinds to   help it maintain that spot.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Without a connection to valuation, evaluating NFLX becomes very difficult.When weevaluated the ""FANG"" stocks, two were easy -Facebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) andAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG). That's because the valuations justify their stock price. The other two, despite being regular components to our everyday life, weren't so easy. Those two stocks were NFLX andAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN).The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for 2017: Still the Best?Instead of trying to buy Amazon, Netflix or Tesla based on valuation, investors have to focus on other catalysts. Put simply, these are story stocks. When the narratives are positive, the stocks do well. When the narratives worsen, they tank.In Netflix's case, strong subscription growth and impressive content gets bulls excited. However, poor global expansion execution and a miss on subscriber estimates gets the bears going.A Closer Look at NFLX StockSo, if you can't value Netflix, how do you trade it? How do you justify owning it? It's simple really. If you believe in the streaming trend, then it makes sense to bet on the leader. Netflix isn't for everybody, but for those who can stomach the volatility, big gains can be had.Let's look at two charts, the short-term and the long-term, starting with the latter.Source: StockCharts.com2-year chartAs you can see, NFLX stock went through a bit of a struggle in 2016. However, it had little trouble exploding higher near the end of the year. Since it rose above $140 in January 2017, though, it has had trouble pushing higher (blue semi-circle). Previous resistance of $130 (blue line) could act as support for Netflix.Source: StockCharts.com7-Month ChartLooking at the short-term chart, it's easier to see the consolidation near $140, while support at $130 isn't so obvious. However, NFLX is sitting right on its 50-day moving average. This same level was tested just a few weeks ago. Generally, the more times a stock tests support or resistance, the more likely it is to break.With earnings coming up, though, that makes this a tougher trade. Support could completely give way, or it could propel NFLX stock higher.The Bottom Line for NetflixAn investor who has owned NFLX stock for many months or years is different than an investor making a move now. For active investors, taking some chips off the table is rarely frowned upon. But, should a correction materialize, they have gains to protect against some of those losses.For new investors, though, buying now could mean trouble. While Netflix seems likely to report another great, exciting earnings report, a disappointment would cause shares to tumble. Given that NFLX stock is already up more than 40% over the last six months, I'd be hesitant to initiate a new position in Netflix.7 Tech Stocks That Are a Sneeze Away From CollapsingI know for some this news won't matter. But, I find it at least a little interesting that its Chief Product Officer, Neil Hunt, and Chief Talent Officer, Tawny Cranz, areleaving the company to pursue other interests. Again, it may mean nothing. But, two departing execs, a stock that's up 45% in six months and earnings on Monday make me want to take the ""wait and see"" approach.NFLX stock could explode to new highs post-earnings. But, it could also have a reasonable pullback even on good results, simply because the stock's up so much. A pullback to $130 would represent a 10% decline and give investors a defined entry and exit in NFLX.The 100-day moving average currently sits at $135 and could also act as support should a pullback materialize.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author ofFuture Blue Chips.

PayPal vs. Visa: Which Mobile Payment Stock Should You Buy?;4/12/2017;"Over the last several years, mobile payment methods have pushed their way into the transaction scene and onto the national stage with the likes of Apple Inc.'sAAPLApple Pay, Alphabet Inc.'sGOOGLAndroid Pay, and Samsung Pay grabbing headlines.It seems clear that the long-term transition to a more cashless, mobile payment-based society is underway. But it is still very much just getting out of the starting blocks.Checks and cash still account for nearly 85% of payment transactions around the world, but mobile payment has gained traction. Areported39% of U.S. mobile phone users made a mobile payment in 2015, and the number could climb to nearly 70% by 2017.Still, a recentWall Street Journalreport suggeststhat only 13% of the estimated 680 million iPhone users have used Apple Pay.This leaves room for payment giants PayPal Holdings, Inc.PYPLand. Visa Inc.Vto grow exponentially. PayPal helped revolutionize e-commerce, and Visa is a credit card king, but now both companies could benefit from investments in mobile payment.The State of Mobile PaymentIn 2017, consumers will spendan estimated$780 billion globally via their mobile devices.According to some estimations, $503 billion worth of via mobile payments could be made in stores in the U.S. alone by 2020.Europe and Australia are leading the way in the shift to mobile and contactless payment, and Visa has placed itself in the drivers seat. In Europe, based onVisa data, 1-in-5 Visa payments were made via contactless mobile credit cards between May 2015 and April 2016, amounting to a total of 3 billion contactless Visa transactions.Visa's payWave contactless mobile point-of-sale systems were available at 3.2 million POS terminals during that same time. The credit card giant expects the service to be available at all Visa POS terminals in Europe by 2020.In Australia, an estimated 59% of the population made a purchase with a contactless card in 2016. Visa also recently began experimenting with innovative ways for consumers to use contactless payment methods. Visa, with the help of an Australian startup, introducedcontactless payment-enabled sunglassesat a few music festivals in early 2017.After spinning off from eBay in 2015, PayPal also joined the mobile payment movement as the once revolutionary company began to seek out new ways to innovate. U.S. consumers will soon be able to make mobile payments using their PayPal mobile wallet at every store that currently accepts Visa payWave.PayPal also owns millennial peer-to-peer mobile payment powerhouse Venmo, which could also set them up well for the future. The app recorded more than $1 billion worth of transactions in January 2016 alone.Less than 4 millionmerchants in 2016accepted Apple Pay-over 10 million accepted Visa. Apple was thought to soon take over, but its lack of availability has helped place Visa and PayPal ahead of the mobile payment curve in the U.S.PYPL vs. VAs we jump into the head-to-head comparison between PayPal and Visa, let's check out a few key stats from both companies:PYPLVZacks Rank#2 (Buy)#2 (Buy)VGM ScoreDDP/E Ratio30.3626.80Avg. Surprise (Trailing Four Quarters)3.52%5.78%Proj. EPS Growth14.31%16.75%Visa and PayPal are both Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Over the last year, both companies have also surpassed earnings expectations. Both Visa and PayPal have very strong comparable P/E ratios, with Visa holding a small edge.Maybe most impressively, Visa and PayPal have strong projected EPS growth. Visa and PayPal both are set to grow profits by double digits based on their massive projected EPS growth numbers, which is never bad news.Both companies have an overall Value, Growth, Momentum Zacks Style Score of a ""D,"" which means both stocks have room to improve in these areas. Visa earned a ""C"" grade for Growth, and ""D"" for Value, meaning it does not present the most bang for your buck at this moment. PayPal earned a ""C"" grade for Growth and Value.One thing that might give PayPal an advantage heading into earning season is that Visa currently has a negative Earnings ESP, which means Visa's most recent earnings estimates have been lower than the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. This makes surprise predictions more difficult.What's WorkingBoth companies have actively tried to look for different ways to improve growth potential and revenue streams.Visa's market cap is currently $206.39 billion, and its stock price has risen steadily. The credit card giant's stock is trading for just under its all-time high at roughly $89 per share. PayPal's market cap is $52.71 billion, and its stock is also trading at a near all-time high of $44 per share.There are currently over 3 billion Visa cards worldwide, and the company processed $8.2 trillion worth of payments in fiscal 2016, which amounted to $15.1 billion in revenue. The company has also bolstered its relationship with online and mobile payments outlets, including PayPal.In 2016, PayPal processed $99 billion worth of payments. PayPal's revenue was $10.8 billion, up 17% year-over-year. The company's millennial jewel, Venmo, processed $5.6 billion in payments last quarter, up 126%. Some merchants recently began allowing customers to use Venmo, which will help expand the strictly peer-to-peer business.The mobile payment revolution has begun, and both PayPal and Visa fought to be at the forefront of the new era of monetary transactions.For more on this revolution listen to this episode of the Zacks Friday Finish Line Podcast:Looking for Ideas with Even Greater   Upside?Most of Zacks' investment ideas are short-term, directly based on our proven 1 to 3 month indicator.

Strong PC Shipments Witnessed in Q1: Gartner, IDC;4/12/2017;"The two independent research firms - Gartner Inc.ITand International Data Corporation (""IDC"") - yesterday reported their worldwide PC shipment data. Although the numbers of both firms are different, they have one similar opinion that the worldwide PC shipment has shown concrete signs of improvement in the very first quarter of 2017.According to Gartner, although PC shipment declined year over year, it is rather modest compared with several previous quarters. On the other hand, as per IDC, PC shipment recorded its first growth in the last five quarter.Decline Moderated - Per GartnerThe preliminary data released by Gartner showed that PC shipments in the quarter were down 2.4% year over year to 62.2 million units. The decline marked the 10th straight quarter of year-over-year fall, which is the longest duration of decline in the history of the PC industry.During the quarter, the industry witnessed modest growth in business PCs for the first time, after several quarters of decline. However, demand for consumer PCs continued to decline as various customers refrained from replacing their older PCs, while some consumers stopped using PCs as they can do their work on other mobile devices.Gartner stated that among the top six vendors, Asus and Acer witnessed declines in PC sales, while the likes of Lenovo, HP Inc.HPQ, Dell and AppleAAPLrecorded growth during the first quarter. However, companies under the Others category witnessed a 12% drop in PC shipments.Lenovo managed to retain its leading position with 19.9% market share. Most importantly, the company registered a year-over-year increase in PC sales for the second time in a row, after witnessing a decline for several quarters. Lenovo saw 1.2% growth in PC sales during the first quarter.HP Inc. and Dell were the other gainers during the quarter, and recorded the fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. Holding the second spot among worldwide PC vendors, HP Inc. registered 6.5% growth in PC shipments and raised its market share to 19.5% from 17.9% in the year-ago quarter. Dell, which occupied the third position, witnessed 3.4% growth and raised its market share to 15% from 14.2% in first-quarter 2016.After making a comeback in fourth-quarter 2016, Apple continued to witness year-over-year growth in the first quarter as well. During the quarter, the company's Mac sales climbed 4.5%, which helped it to improve its market share to 6.8% from 6.3%. It holds the fifth spot among the top six PC vendors.Asus and Acer held the fourth and sixth spots respectively, witnessing a year-over-year decline in PC shipments of 14% and 1.8%.First Growth After Five Years - Per IDCIDC stated that after witnessing decline for consecutive five years, worldwide PC shipments registered its first growth in this quarter. During the first quarter, PC shipments grew 0.6% year over year to about 60.3 million units. According to, Jay Chou, research manager, IDC PCD Tracker ""The traditional PC market has been through a tough phase, with competition from tablets and smartphones as well as lengthening lifecycles pushing PC shipments down roughly 30% from a peak in 2011.""The difference in data is mainly due to different techniques used for tracking PC sales as well as the inclusion and/or exclusion of certain products. For example, unlike Gartner, IDC includes Chromebooks, which run on Alphabet Inc.'sGOOGLChrome operating system. Gartner, on the other hand, takes into account Microsoft Corp.MSFTtablets and ""detachables"" such as the iPad Pro and the Asus Transformer, which are not taken into account by IDC.In the top vendors list too, the firm has a different opinion. According to IDC, HP is the leading PC vendor, with 21.8% market share followed by Lenovo, Dell, Apple and Acer with respective market share of 20.4%, 15.9%, 7% and 6.8%.Talking about the geographical performance, IDC revealed that PC shipment in the U.S. and Asia/Pacific (excluding Japan) (APeJ) slightly declined year over year, while that in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) and Japan grew marginally. Notably, sales in Japan witnessed year-over-year growth for the third consecutive quarter.What's AheadAlthough, both firms reported encouraging first-quarter PC shipment data, their forward looking statements makes us slightly cautious about the prospects of the PC industry. Both firms agreed that the recent surge in DRAM prices and short supply of SSD will lead to an increase in PC prices.Mikako Kitagawa, principal analyst at Gartner said that, ""The price hike will suppress PC demand even further in the consumer market, discouraging buyers away from PC purchases unless it is absolutely necessary. The price hike started affecting the market in 1Q17. This issue will grow into a much bigger problem in 2Q17, and we expect it to continue throughout 2017."" IDC also predicted that consumer demand will remain under pressure.Computer - Peripheral Equipment Industry 5YR %     ReturnComputer - Peripheral Equipment Industry 5YR %     ReturnBottom LineIn the emerging markets, consumers are increasingly opting for relatively inexpensive mobile computing devices, such as smartphones. The increase in functionality and larger screen sizes (5 inches and above) are boosting the demand for such devices. Additionally, the ongoing transformation in the way people communicate has led to the proliferation of mobile devices.Therefore, we believe that PC manufacturers have to deal with cost of device to ensure long-term growth. Furthermore, in our opinion, PC vendors' focus on innovative products such as 2-in-1s, and thin and light notebooks, as well as technology enhancements can make customers opt for a new PC.According to Ms. Kitagawa, principal analyst at Gartner, ""While the consumer market will continue to shrink, maintaining a strong position in the business market will be critical to keep sustainable growth in the PC market. Winners in the business segment will ultimately be the survivors in this shrinking market."" He further cautioned, ""Vendors who do not have a strong presence in the business market will encounter major problems, and they will be forced to exit the PC market in the next five years. However, there will also be specialized niche players with purpose-built PCs, such as gaming PCs and ruggedized laptops.""From the long-term perspective, PCs have to compete with mobile computing devices. The decline will hurt the business prospects of companies like HP Inc., Intel Corp.INTC, Seagate TechnologiesSTXand Western DigitalWDC, which continue to depend substantially on PC sales.Currently, Apple, Alphabet and Seagate carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Top Executives Keep Fleeing Uber, Is the Ride-Hailing Giant Doomed?;4/12/2017;"Uber Technologies Inc. has taken another hit to its public image, and this time there might be no one left to clean up the mess. Rachel Whetstone, Uber's communications chief, announced Tuesday she would be leaving the ride-hailing giant while the company faces an onslaught of public relations nightmares.Whetstone, a former executive at Alphabet Inc.'sGOOGLGoogle who joined Uber in 2015, resigned without giving reason. It is still unclear what prompted Whetstone to leave in the midst of a pivotal time for Uber, but the timing seems a little odd given that PR disasters have piled up recently.Her second in command, Jill Hazelbaker, is set to take over the position, which has become more important than ever.Whetstone's departure marks theseventh high-rankingUber employee to depart from the company in 2017 alone. Not all of them left on bad terms, but Ed Baker, head of product and growth, resigned after the company's internal workplace culture investigation ramped up.Many of the top Uber employees supposedly left on good terms, but it seems hard to think the massive amount of recent public, political, and legal backlash had nothing to do with it.But does the mass executive-level exodus signal Uber is doomed to fail? Or is the company that is currently valued at almost $70 billion just experiencing growing pains?Potential Long Term ProblemsAmong other things, Uber is looking intoclaims of rampant sexual harassmentat the company's corporate offices. The company is alsofighting a lawsuitfrom Google's self-driving leg Waymo, which claims Uber stole a ton of its proprietary self-driving car technology.More recently, Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto voiced his concern that Uber wasnot pulling its weight financiallyin the agreement to test its self-driving car technology in the city. Pittsburgh one of the only places in the U.S. willing to let Uber test its new technology.Travis Kalanick recently apologized for a video that went viral of the Uber CEO berating and demeaning an Uber driver while he was a passenger. In wake of the incident, Kalanick, 40, also recently admitted that he needed management guidance.It is a positive sign that Uber's CEO admitted to needing some guidance in order to help drive his company forward during rocky times. The only problem is that no one with the proper experience has stepped up to the plate yet.Scandal is not a good thing for any company, and it could prove to very bad for Uber as it looks into the possibility of going public in the next couple of years. Still, despite the controversies and a need to bolster leadership, things are not all bad for Uber.It's Not All BadIn today's mile-a-minute world, people simply forget things. It seems like ages since the""Delete Uber"" hashtagfirst popped up. Even though the company and its controversial CEO are still taking deserved heat almost daily, the rider numbers speak to a different narrative.The head of Uber North America's operations, Rachel Holt, spoke with reporters in late March about the ride-hailing company's eye-popping rider numbers. ""In fact, in our most mature country, we've grown faster in the first 10 weeks of 2017 than in the first 10 weeks of 2016,""Holt said. ""Looking at less-mature regions, trips were up 600% in February, year on year.""Holt did not go into any further details about the privately held company's most recent numbers, but it seems that even as Uber tries to navigate a tumultuous and sometimes toxic road, many riders cannot resist the convenience and ubiquity of the ride-hailing company's service.Head herefor a more in-depth look at Uber's competition, controversy, and the possibility of a 2017 IPO.Looking for Ideas with Even Greater   Upside?Most of Zacks' investment ideas are short-term, directly based on our proven 1 to 3 month indicator.

But on a purely technical basis, something major did occur: TheDow Jones Industrial Averageclosed below its 50-day moving average, a key technical support level for the first time since November.makeArticleAd();The catalyst for the decline were lingering concerns about the geopolitical outlook (amid hotpots in Syria and North Korea concerning both Russia and China) as well as ongoing reports pooh-poohing the likelihood of action on tax reform before the end of the year.In the end, the Dow lost 0.3%, theS&P 500lost 0.4%, theNasdaq Compositegave back 0.5% and theRussell 2000was 1.3% lower. Treasury bonds were stronger, the dollar was weaker, gold gained 0.3% and oil broke a string of gains to decline 0.5%.Defensive utility and telecom stocks led the way with gains of 0.6% while industrial were the laggards, down 1.3%.

Regarding North Korea, Chinese President Xi reportedly told President Trump in a phone call that there should be a peaceful solution to the problem as Chinese officials warn Pyongyang against conducting another nuclear weapons test.As a reminder, Trump has been lobbying Beijing hard for support in the matter, threatening trade sanctions. North Korea is expected to conduct another long-range missile test on Thursday.Here at home, Trump in an interview said he would prefer to act on healthcare reform legislation first before tackling taxes - despite the fact a big push on the matter failed in the House of Representatives after pushback from conservative Republicans. Trump told Fox Business that healthcare reform could potentially free up hundreds of millions of dollars that could be used to offset the cost of tax cuts.In a separate interview with the Wall Street Journal, Trump said the U.S. dollar was ""too strong,"" said he preferred interest rates staying low, and said he might reappoint Federal Reserve chairman Janet Yellen - despite his criticisms of her on the campaign trail - after sitting down and talking with her in the Oval Office.

Apple (AAPL) or Alphabet (GOOGL): Which Is Better?;4/12/2017;"After a ho-hum fourth-quarter earnings season, investors are on the edge of their seats for the first quarter of this year. The beginning of 2017 was difficult for tech companies as they were exposed to risk of trade wars and the anti-immigration stance.However, the tech sector had a relatively good run against a tough macroeconomic backdrop. Advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) technology, breakthroughs in chip-shrinking technology, self-driving cars, personal assistants, high-speed Internet and home automation kept the buzz surrounding the sector alive.Moreover, as the global economy is gaining momentum, technology companies appear to be in the best position to prosper. They are also less susceptible to interest rates or deregulation. Among sector bellwethers, mega-cap tech names like AppleAAPLhave surged this year, along with Alphabet Inc.GOOGLAmazon.com, Inc.AMZN, and Facebook, Inc.FB.Here's a look at the performance of both the companies in the last quarter and what awaits them in the to-be reported quarter.AppleApple Inc. emerged the top gainer for the Dow during the first quarter. Since the last earnings reported by Apple, its shares have added about 8.6%, outperforming the market.Apple reported better-than-expected first quarter of fiscal 2017 results. Earnings of $3.36 per share and revenues of $78.4 billion easily topped the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.22 and $76.9 billion. On a year-over-year basis, both metrics registered growth of 2.4% and 3.3%.A variety of factors contributed to the stock's gain, including a rebound in iPhone sales growth, investments made by Warren Buffet and the company's efforts to boost its services revenue. Apple has expanded its market capitalization by more than $140 billion over the period, an amount which is higher than the gains mopped by all other Dow components taken together.Apple Looks GoodApple, a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) technology stock, generated a strong three-month return of around 18.86%. The company has a market cap of $743.07 billion. It has a VGM score of A.The stock delivered three positive earnings surprises in the last four quarters with an average beat of 0.89%. Moreover, in the last 30 days, three estimates for fiscal 2017 were raised upward, pushing the Zacks Consensus Estimate up by 0.34% (3 cents) to $8.94.One of the biggest catalysts for Apple this quarter could be the performance of the iPhone as always. Apple plans to introduce its customary updated versions of the iPhone with the release of the tentatively named iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus. Besides the new iPhone offerings, the best news for Apple and its investors is the massively aging iPhone install-user base.Stock performanceComing to the stock performance, shares of Apple performed more or less in line with the broader ZacksComputer - Mini Computersindustry in the last one year. While the industry gained 27.31%, the stock returned 26.29%The in-line performance of the stock can primarily be attributed to good growth in its services revenues, especially with regard to Apple Music and App Store. However, the company is witnessing sluggish demand for its flagship offering, the iPhone in major markets worldwide. Also, intensifying competition and macroeconomic headwinds remain concerns for the company.AlphabetAs usual, all eyes will be on the company formerly known as Google, Alphabet Inc., as the tech giant prepares to release its first-quarter earnings. The company missed its fourth-quarter earnings by 1.18%.Higher cost of revenue and steeper taxes impacted the quarter's earnings. Since the last earnings reported by Alphabet, its shares have lost about 0.6%.However, YouTube continues to remain a strong contributor benefiting from the increase in online video consumption. More than a thousand creators are currently engaged with the platform, bringing in a thousand subscribers every day.Also, Google gained strength in the mobile platform. Management is focused on driving mobile experiences and the company is well positioned to pick up strong intent-to-buy signals as a result of studying mobile searches from its huge database. As a result, revenue from mobile platform is expected to increase in the upcoming results.Also, Google platforms like Android, Chrome and Daydream continue to help it draw more users and sell more ads.Alphabet Not Far BehindAlphabet, on the other hand, also carries a Zacks Rank #2, and that's always a good sign heading into an earnings announcement.Alphabet generated a return of 0.99% in the last three months. The company has a market cap of 573.85 billion.Ahead of the report, Alphabet Inc. has seen one positive estimate revision in the last 60 days. Our current consensus estimates indicate earnings per share growth of 19.52% and sales growth of 19.32%. This helped the company to earn a ""B"" grade for growth. This is especially noteworthy given the relative size and status of Alphabet already.The stock delivered two positive earnings surprises in the last four quarters with an average beat of 2.71%. Nevertheless, Alphabet currently has an Earnings ESP of 0.0%, which makes surprise prediction a bit more difficult.Stock performanceComing to the stock performance, over the past one year, shares of Alphabet have been steadily treading higher. The stock returned 8.72% compared with the Zacks categorizedInternet Servicesindustry's gain of 5.73%.Bottom LineApple and Alphabet are two of the biggest companies in the tech space. Both stocks have their share of positives and negatives. While Apple has been a steady performer, Google is in for some tough competition, which will likely unfold over the next five years or so. Both have strong balance sheets, ample financial flexibility, manageable debt capital ratios and strong shareholder return policies in place along with sound management.But given the current scenario, we would bet on Apple because it is well-positioned to outpace the industry and is fundamentally strong enough to withstand risks.You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks   here.Zacks' Best Private Investment IdeasWhile we are happy to share many articles like this on the website, our best recommendations and most in-depth research are not available to the public.

Fiber-Optic Group Stages Easter Rally, But Can It Sidestep Consolidation?;4/12/2017;"With new customers likeFacebook(FB) andAlphabet's (GOOGL) Google in hand, and possiblyApple(AAPL) and smartphone makers next, it looks as if fiber-optic   component makers should count their blessings.AT&T(T) and other phone companies are still heavy buyers,   expanding their telecom networks. And China remains a hot spot as   its telecoms upgrade optical technologies for both 4G wireless   networks and landline broadband services in urban and rural   areas.The problem, analysts say, is too many fiber-optic component   suppliers are chasing after growth opportunities. The overcrowded   industry, they say, could use a round or two of consolidation to   improve profits.makeArticleAd();ButApplied Optoelectronics(AAOI) snubbed that view late Wednesday, pre-releasing first-quarter   guidance that continued its habit ofbullish earnings and revenue forecasts. Shares soared 22% at the start of trade Thursday, and the news   also liftedFinisar(FNSR),Oclaro(OCLR),Lumentum Holdings(LITE) in early trade.Despite the gains, the 14-stock industry group collectively   ended the holiday-shortened week down nearly 3%.  Investors   have sent many fiber-optics stocks down hard over the past two   weeks, despite outlooks calling for much of the group to post   strong double- and triple-digit earnings growth this year.But estimates across much of the industry drop sharply for   2018, and that's kept investors trained on the industry's ability   to maintain growth.Finisar and Lumentum Holdings, the two biggest   fiber-optic parts makers, hold only 16% and 10% of the market,   says James Kisner, an analyst at Jefferies. Other suppliers   include the much smaller Oclaro,Acacia Communications(ACIA), Applied Optoelectronics,Inphi(IPHI) andNeoPhotonics(NPTN).""The market structure is tough, there's too many companies   competing for a deal,"" said Kisner in an interview.Kisner explains that nearly half of the very fragmented market   is ""others"": companies with low single-digit share.""Consolidation would help,"" he said.Lumentum, Finisar and Oclaro all figure in   speculation over consolidation. But they are also pricey, and   deals may wait for an industry slowdown, analysts say.Internet companies Facebook, Google andAmazon.com(AMZN) are building new data centers as fast as they can to whisk   video, photos and cloud-based services to ""mobile millennials.""   Those would be young adults that can't get enough ofSnapchat(SNAP), YouTube orNetflix(NFLX).Hyperscale Shortens Investment CycleOptical networking is part of the ""hyperscale"" network   infrastructure - also including servers, switches, and software -   that runs the internet cloud. Fiber optics provides superfast   communications between stacks of servers and switches, as well as   linking warehouse-size data centers.Internet content providers in 2016 upped spending on DCI gear   by 38% to $904 million, says Dell'Oro Group.To connect their networks of data centers, internet companies   are expected to upgrade from 100 gigabit-per-second technology to   400 Gbps gear by 2019 or 2020. Makers of fiber-optic parts are   revving up research and development to meet the faster upgrade   cycles of internet companies.""With telecom, those customers may want a product that lasts   10 years and be rock solid. So optical component companies test   the crap out of products and the cycles are long and it's easier   to recoup R&D,"" added Kisner.But hyperscale customers may upgrade data centers every three   years. With shorter investment cycles it makes sense for there to   be fewer players, ""consolidation would help eliminate some of the   duplicative R&D,"" Kisner says.Augmenting The iPhone RealityLumentum, Finisar andII-IV(IIVI) are chasing another new market - consumer electronics,   analysts say. There's been speculation they're in the running to   provide 3D-sensor devices to Apple for the upcoming iPhone 8.Apple is said to be interested in 3D sensors for facial   recognition as well as augmented reality. While virtual reality   immerses a user in an imagined or replicated world (like video   games), augmented reality overlays digital imagery onto the real   world. (A simple example: the brutally addictive ""Pokemon   Go."")""The optical vendors are not sure of the actual application   that Apple intends to deploy, but they seem highly certain of the   ramp ahead of the (iPhone 8) launch,"" said a Barclays report.   Even so, some analysts speculate that only some models of the   iPhone 8 will include 3D sensors and that more advanced apps,   such as augmented reality, may wait until 2018.Shares of Lumentum and Finisar dropped hard April 5, amid news   reports that Apple's iPhone 8 could be delayed until October   or November, vs. its original September target. Glitches in   production and worries over weakening demand in China have also   sent the industry's twitchy stocks plummeting.The Beast Is Set For A ReboundIn China,China Mobile(CHL),China Telecom(CHA) andChina Unicom(CHU) have been big buyers of domestically sourced optical   technology, through gear makers Huawei, ZTE and FiberHome.""China has been a beast in deployment,"" said Jimmy Yu, analyst   at Dell'Oro Group. While spending eased in late 2016, Yu says a   new round of contracts are expected to be awarded this spring. A   strong rebound in China optical demand is expected in the   back half of 2017, he says.According to a UBS report in March, NeoPhotonics has the   highest exposure to China at 60% of revenue, followed by Oclaro   at 40%, Acacia at 40%, Lumentum at 30% and Finisar at 20%.Consolidation Interrupted?Many of the industry's stocks have retreated from highs set   first in September 2016 and then again in March. Even so, IBD's   Telecom Fiber-Optics group has collectively gained some 62% from   two years ago, and company valuations are historically high,   analysts say.That poses a stumbling block to industry consolidation, says   William Blair analyst Dmitry Netis.""Until we get closer to peak of the cycle I don't expect big   deals,"" said Netis. ""Right now, capacity is constrained with   strong demand coming from China. When supply meets demand, then   things will get on an even keel and maybe that's when   consolidation happens.""That may not happen until late 2018, Netis says. For now,   multiples are stretched with some companies trading at 20 times   PE.""That's a pretty rich valuation,"" he said.Nonetheless, Finisar, Oclaro and Acacia have turned to   the markets to raise capital, leading some analysts to speculate   about deals.UBS analyst Tejas Venkatesh, in a report, says Finisar has   some $1.2 billion on its balance sheet while Oclaro is ""a   believer in big deals"" to improve industry profitability.""Key swing factors in consolidation could be price, given   stocks have run up, manufacturing locations and extent of   vertical integration among different players in the industry,""   added Venkatesh in the report.At the Optical Fiber Communication (OFC) exhibition in   March, mergers were a hot topic.""There was increasing talk about needed consolidation in the   space, both components and systems, with the biggest hang-up   being currently elevated valuations across the space,"" said Meta   Marshall, a Morgan Stanley analyst in a report. ""We still   maintain this is the best way to improve profitability across a   fiercely competitive space, but did not walk away thinking   activity was imminent.""Marshall says one problem is that too many vendors are   investing in developing next-generation 400 Gbps products. ""There   may not be enough commonality in 400G approaches to amortize the   large amount of development,"" he said.IBD'S TAKE:Which companies are hitting 52-week highs? That's easy to     find at IBD'sNew Highs, but that list goes one big step better. That is, it ranks the     companies making new highs byComposite Rating.That was basically the approach taken by JDS Uniphase,   Lumentum's forerunner, when it rolled up many fiber-optic   component makers following the telecom boom of the late 1990s.   But competition from Asian suppliers has since increased,   particularly in mature product categories. The result has been   pressure on prices.Today, startups continue to roil the market, some funded by   internet companies aiming to develop next-generation   technologies.Recent entrants include Ayar Labs, Elenion Technologies,   ColorChip, Lumus, InnoLight, and Fiber Mountain. They're   targeting emerging opportunities in augmented reality, silicon   photonics (miniaturizing optical and electrical   components onto a silicon chip); and software-defined networking   (SDN) in data centers.Competition Heats Up Across IndustryOptical component companies make lasers, transceivers,   amplifiers and filters, but there is a lot of bump-and-grind   movement within the industry's trade lanes.NeoPhotonics and Oclaro supply lasers to module-maker Acacia,   for example. Finisar sells optical parts to optical system   makers such asCiena(CIEN),Infinera(INFN), andCisco Systems(CSCO).At the March OFC exhibition, Ciena announced its entry into   the merchant optical-chip market - providing chips to partners   such as Lumentum, Oclaro and NeoPhotonics. The   three makers of components are expected to build Ciena-designed   chips into modules that plug into communications subsystems.   Ciena's move will pressure Acacia as data centers upgrade to 400   Gbps technology in 2019-2020, analysts say.Analysts say competition has also intensified in the data   center interconnect (DCI) market. Dell'Oro's Yu says a growing   number of internet companies are building their own high-speed   optical networks to link data centers that are spread out across   metropolitan areas, rather than lease network capacity from the   likes of AT&T orLevel 3 Communications(LVLT).Infinera grabbed an early lead in providing DCI systems to   internet customers, but Ciena, Germany's Adva Optical, Coriant   and others are in hot pursuit. Ciena recently won some DCI   business from Amazon, says Netis.Network switch makers such as Cisco andArista Networks(ANET), meanwhile, plan to build more optical technology directly   into their products, says Netis. He says that could make Infinera   a takeover target forJuniper Networks(JNPR), which needs more optical know-how to keep pace with   Cisco, Huawei and other network gear makers.Most growth in the North American optical communications   market is coming from internet firms, says Yu at   Dell'Oro. He says without the spending of internet firms   like Facebook and Amazon, industry sales would be lackluster,   even with network upgrades to 100 Gbps in metropolitan areas by   the likes ofVerizon Communications(VZ).RELATED:Did Apple iPhone 8 Rumor Shake Up Two Fiber     Stocks?Fiber-Optic Vendors Eye Red-Hot Internet     Data-Center Market"

How to Wrangle Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock for Profits;4/12/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIs recent stock weakness inAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMD) offering investors an early warning to make an exit? Or is this a bullish opportunity to buy? Today, we'll look at the current setup in AMD stock, then present a strategy that will provide profits without piling on the risk.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockIt has been just more than a month since I last penned amostly optimistic take and strategy on AMD. Shares of Advanced Micro are mostly unchanged for the period, but beneath the surface, there has been a good deal of price volatility to ponder.The most striking catalyst during this period was a surprising initiation from Goldman Sachs. Last week, the firm slapped AMD stockwith a ""sell"" rating and $11 price targetroughly 20% below the prior night's close. The bearish coverage was good enough to send shares more than 6% lower in a single session.Analyst Toshiya Hari did note many improvements at AMD under the stewardship of CEO Lisa Su. In his view, product launches, cost management and deleveraging of the company's balance sheet have all been well-executed. However, given 2016's substantial 300%-plus gain and relatively steep multiple, Hari warned strongly that Advanced Micro Devices was also ""priced for perfection.""Also, analysts expect that an unfavorable price war with bothIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) andNvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA) would occur at Advanced Micro's expense.The 11 Best Dividend Stocks to BuyIs it time to listen to Goldman? One could use it as a starting point. However, Goldman's calls - beyond their short-term influence - aren't exactly the gold standard. I'd prefer to look at what others have to say and maintain an open mind.AMD Stock ChartClick to EnlargeAdvanced Micro Devices is far from a momentum play right now - at least in the bullish direction. Stochastics are oversold, and an uptrend line of around six months in duration has been broken.Shares could always snap back aggressively with a bullish earnings reaction. But for now, Goldman's knockdown of AMD stock essentially pulled the rug out from what had been a nicely-developing momentum situation.Maybe Goldman is, as alum and CNBC personality James Cramer suggests, merely""taking away the punchbowl""for AMD - but a company that remains on track to grow its business and capture market share?AMD's chart does more accurately reflect a punchbowl situation. And there's nothing wrong with embracing this type of more technically driven entry into shares.Just don't play Advanced Micro Devices too loosely.How to Trade AMD StockI think Advanced Micro is a buy amid a short-lived corrective move, but I want to better control risk than just a simple stop-loss methodology.Right now, I suggest theMay $15 call/$12 put collar. With shares at $13, the package is priced for $13.20. For the 20-cent cost or additional premium paid over simply owning shares, the investor is fully protected below $12.BlackBerry Ltd (BBRY) Stock Jumps 18% on License Win Against QualcommTechnically speaking, the collar's insurance makes sense. A low of $12.38 back in early March does appear to be significant in maintaining, while still allowing for a smidgeon of wiggle room down to the $12 put.AMD's next earnings report is scheduled for May 1. In our view, the real cost of this collar is the earnings report, or maybe a product update. Then, there's a significant shift of bullish momentum in shares. Remember, the $15 call is being sold to finance the protective put. So without any adjustments, the call sale does initially cap upside at 12%.Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in any of the securities or their derivatives mentioned in this article.

Facebook Inc (FB): It’s Not Too Late to Buy FB Stock;4/12/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsI confess thatFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) never appealed to me as an investment. I avoid momentum stocks anyway, and I didn't really believe that meaningful revenue would be generated by Mark Zuckerberg & Co. I was dead wrong.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockFacebook has become a digital billboard, generating a massive 98% of its revenue from ads, which can be a terrific business. Now,more than 5 million businesses advertise on Facebook.com.As technology improved and the ability to ascertain return on investment became more and more efficient, finding which sources for eyeballs would pay the best became easier. I never thought FB stock would be such a place, but here we are.Not only that, but FB has gotten even better at figuring out how to leverage its users into generating more revenue, and a lot of that is happening via mobile. It makes sense, of course, because the entire world is mobile at this point and emerging markets are moving out of 2G into higher speeds.Thus, FB stock has soared because it really owns the display side of generating digital ad revenue, whileAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) owns the search side of the business.10 Blue-Chip Stocks That Will Bleed for the Rest of 2017I'm going to do some number-crunching here. I don't want to overwhelm, but you'll see how FB stock price is going up on the backs of some impressive growth as shown in Q4:Daily Active Users (or DAUs): 1.23 billion, geographically well-diversified with the U.S. & Canada at 15%, Europe at 21%, Asia-Pacific coming in at 32%, and the rest of the globe also at 32%.Mobile DAUs: 1.15 billionMonthly Active Users (also known as MAUs): 1.86 billionMobile MAUs: 1.74 billionGrowth in ad revenue for Q4, year-over-year was an astonishing 53% to $8.63 billion.Not only are users growing, but the average revenue per monthly active user (or ARPU) is off the charts for North America, climbing from $9 in Q4 of 2014 to $13.70 in 2015 (more than 50%!) and $19.81 last year, up nearly 50%.Going back to this idea that mobile revenue growth is exploding on the backs of improving mobile technology, mobile revenue in Q4 of 2014 was $2.5 billion. It nearly tripled to $7.2 billion last year.When you look at the entire digital ad spend these days, it is dominated by Facebook and Google.I hate the idea that 98% of a company's revenues comes from one thing. Diversification means everything to me. However, I cannot argue with the fact that FB is the 800-pound gorilla in the space.There are only three things that can upset the apple cart for FB stock, and neither seem like they could ever be permanently damaging. First, it is possible that something else appears that makes Facebook decline in popularity. This seems extremely unlikely at this point in time. Barring some kind of horrendous PR disaster that causes Facebook to implode, I don't take this threat seriously.Second, it is possible that the number of users is being misreported. How FB actually determines the number of users and how active they are is what matters here, and if advertisers ever lose confidence in that data, they could run for the hills. I'm not suggesting that this is the case, but if it were, then there would be trouble.Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Won't Hit $1000 Like ThisFinally, a severe recession could cripple advertising spending. The thing about this is that it would be temporary. The financial crisis took a toll on companies that relied on ad revenue, but it came back. Facebook's balance sheet is a fortress, so little would be impacted.FB stock trades at 40 times its earnings. And now, I can't say it's unreasonable considering its growth rate.Lawrence Meyers is the CEO of PDL Capital, and manager of the forthcomingLiberty Portfolio stock newsletter.

Netflix (NFLX) to Report Q1 Earnings: What's in the Cards?;4/12/2017;"Netflix, Inc.NFLXis set to report first-quarter 2017 results on Apr 17. In the last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 15.38%. The company has delivered positive earnings surprises in the last four quarters with an average beat of 141.35%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderNetflix has been drawing strength from its growing portfolio of original content. This apart, it remains focused on international expansion as it battles slowing domestic subscriber growth to solidify its presence in markets like India and Korea.The recently added features like offline viewing and skip opening credits reflect Netflix's focus on enhancing user experience, which is a positive.Netflix, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseNetflix, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise|Netflix, Inc. QuoteMeanwhile, Investopedia, which quoted research firm Comscore, stated that Netflix remains the leader in the over-the-top (OTT) services space despite stiff competition from Alphabet Inc.'sGOOGLYouTube and Amazon.com, Inc.'sAMZNAmazon Prime Video service. The study is based on data collected in the month of December last year.Furthermore, reportedly, in Dec 2016, Netflix had the highest penetration rate of 75% when it came to OTT services, followed by YouTube with 53%. Amazon and Hulu have penetration rates of 33% and 17%, respectively. Notably, subscribers of Netflix clocked 28 hours of average viewing time per month, closely trailing Sling TV with an average viewing time of 47 hours per month.We note that Netflix has outperformed the ZacksBroadcasting-Radio/TVindustry in the last one year. While the stock returned 35%, the industry gained 14.9%.The outperformance can be attributed to the company's continuing subscriber growth and an expanding original content product portfolio.However, investors need to watch out for high costs that will accompany rapid international expansion and production of original content.For the first quarter of 2017, management forecasts earnings of 37 cents per share. Domestic and international streaming revenues are expected to be $1.471 billion and $1.045 billion, respectively. Total streaming revenues are expected to be $2.516 billion. Management expects to add 1.50 million subscribers in the domestic streaming segment compared with 3.70 million subscribers in the international segment in the first quarter.Domestic streaming contribution profit is expected to be $607 million. International streaming segment is expected to report profits to the tune of $16 million. Netflix estimates U.S. contribution margin to be around 41.3% in the quarter. Netflix forecasts operating income of $239 million for the quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Netflix is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positiveEarnings ESPand a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP:Netflix's Earnings ESP is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 38 cents per share. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with ourEarnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank:Netflix has a Zacks Rank #3. Though Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 increases the predictive power of ESP, the company's ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.Meanwhile, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stock to ConsiderHere is a stock that, as per our model, has the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:TE Connectivity LtdTEL, with an Earnings ESP of +0.94% and a Zacks Rank #2.

Tech Roundup: TWTR Sues, Surface Tops iPad, MSFT Scorpio;4/12/2017;"Last week, the big technology companies saw limited movement in share prices amidst news that TwitterTWTRsued the government, Microsoft'sMSFTSurface beat Apple'sAAPLiPad in customer satisfaction, the Xbox Project Scorpio reveal and Intel'sINTCMcAfee spinoff (announced last year).Here are the details-Twitter Sues Then Withdraws Suit Against U.S.   GovernmentThe government sent an order to Twitter to reveal the IP addresses and phone numbers of an account called @ALT_uscis that had been trolling President Donald Trump about his immigration policies mostly with respect to Mexico. The account was created in January with its 9,000 tweets garnering it 120,000 followers.Twitter sued the Department of Homeland Security and US Customs and Border Protection to block the order, claiming that it was ""unlawfully abusing a limited-purpose investigatory tool"" (related to import of counterfeit goods), especially since the person behind the account was merely criticizing Trump and there was no evidence to suggest that it was engaged in criminal activity.The following day, Twitter lawyer Mark Flanagan said that the summons had been withdrawn and that the demand ""no longer has any force or effect."" Further details weren't available.Surface Beats iPadMicrosoft may finally have achieved what it set out to do when it introduced the first Surface several years ago. Despite its less-than-satisfactory features, Microsoft continued to pitch the product against Apple's popular iPad while quickly learning from its mistakes to make better and better iterations. Microsoft needed in on the BYOD market, which was rapidly eating into its share of PCs.Fast forward to today and J.D. Power's 2017 U.S. Tablet Satisfaction Study reveals that Microsoft's Surface brings greater satisfaction to customers than Apple's iPad and tablets from Samsung, LG, Amazon, Acer and Asus, beating all the devices on three counts: Internet connectivity, availability of official accessories and the variety of pre-installed applications.Its attractiveness, materials quality and size were also considered better than the iPad. Moreover, according to the study, people who want the latest technology, or want something as capable as a laptop are opting for the Surface more often than the iPad.Apple still sells more tablets than anyone else.Microsoft Project Scorpio RevealMicrosoft has developed a brand new gaming console in an initiative it calls Project Scorpio. The primary goal appears to be to handle 4K video at 60 frames per second, but according to Eurogamer's Digital Foundry, which did an independent check, there will be power to spare for additional visual improvements.There were probably a  couple of reasons why Microsoft's XB One wasn't very successful, the first being its aspiration to capture every kind of gamer from the casual to the most serious and the second being its uncompetitive price. With this console Microsoft has made its choice: it's going full throttle for the hard core gamer.This looks like a better strategy since casual gamers will be slower to adopt a console anyway because they might satisfy their needs with a mobile device or make do with cheaper alternatives.  But a hard core gamer needs a console because nothing else will do. So this is a better segment to target your console at.The pricing issue is trickier although the current market guesstimate is between $400 and $600. Some say it could go higher because the BOM cost is higher for this device and because hard-core gamers don't mind spending. Others say that it will lose out to Sony's PS4 Pro despite being more powerful if the pricing isn't right.Intel Spins Off McAfeeIntel has completed the deal to spin off Intel Security as it refocuses its efforts on the cloud.McAfee for its part gets increased agility to better address security concerns that are changing rapidly given the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) as well as the increased connectivity of emerging markets, both of which are creating new opportunities. Tech Crunch says that currently, McAfee secures two-thirds of the world's 2,000 largest companies and grew its revenue 11% in the first half of 2016.Intel spent $7.8 billion to buy McAfee seven years ago and TPG is now getting a 51% stake in a deal worth $4.2 billion. Intel initially killed the brand and regrouped the business under Intel Security, but with the spin-off, McAfee is back in the game.TickerPrice Change Last WeekPrice Change Last 6 MonthsAAPL-0.22%+25.67%FB-0.89%+9.39%GOOGL-0.67%+3.87%MSFT-0.27%+13.33%CSCO-2.49%+4.70%AMZN+0.94%+9.65%Other storiesCorporateApple Moving Beyond Imagination: Apple GPU supplier Imagination Technologies has issued a press release saying that Apple will stop using its technology in new products within the next 15-24 months. There's a lot of speculation about why Apple is doing this, despite the fact that the press release says that Apple will be sing independently developed GPU designs.Imagination says that Apple is unlikely to be able to do it without infringing on its patents, so it expects that licensing revenue will be down but not out. But it's also true that the iPhone maker has been recruiting a large number of GPU engineers and history says that it can do it (as in the case of its CPU design).GPU technology is very important not only for its flagship line of iPhones, but also for emerging new markets like AR/VR and auto, so it's very unlikely that Apple is bluffing about its technology. Unless it's working to pressure Imagination prices and then buy out the company, something that it could do very easily given its cash hoard.Apple India News: The Indian daily Economic Times has reported that given the institution of goods and services tax (GST), it will become hard for Apple to obtain specific customs duty exemptions and freight subsidies for the products it is getting ready to assemble at the Bangalore plant.  Meanwhile, the App Accelerator center in Bangalore kicked off last week with minimum fanfare.Apple's goal here is to collaborate with local developers to make suitable apps for the Apple ecosystem. Which may be just what Apple needs as Counterpoint Research estimates that there will be a billion netizens in India by 2020. A Google and BCG study says that Indian smartphone users in 2020 will be 520 million. That is huge potential and Apple is getting in at the right time.Facebook News Literacy Project: FacebookFB, along with organizations like Craig Newmark Philanthropic Fund, Ford Foundation, Democracy Fund, John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, Tow Foundation, AppNexus, Mozilla and Betaworks is forming a group to which they will contribute $14 million to tailor how consumers read news. The initiative is being called The News Integrity Initiative and is Facebook's way of making mends with the ""fake news"" attack on its platform. Urban Dictionary describes ""fake news"" really well: A term formerly useful for describing websites consisting entirely of intentionally fabricated news stories, but now used to describe virtually anything that does not mesh with one's own views.YouTube Go in India: Alphabet'sGOOGLYouTube Go, supporting English and the Indian languages Hindi, Bengali, Tamil, Marathi, Telugu, Kannada, Gujarati and Malayalam, launched its beta version last week. This is basically a data-light app offering recommendations and trending videos from your area when you open the app, with an option to watch the preview of any video before you decide to play it or download for offline viewing.As may be expected, the video won't be too great because 640p resolution is the best that it can do. But it does allow you to decide how much data you want to use on each video and also lets you share video with friends near you without using any data (through Wi-Fi direct and Bluetooth).Amazon Creating Jobs: AmazonAMZNis creating 5,000 new part time Virtual Customer Service positions as part of its initiative to add 30,000 part-time positions in the U.S. over the next year. This is in addition to the 100,000 full-time full-benefit jobs it has promised to create over the next 18 months. Part timers spending more than 20 hours a week will be considered for other benefits including Amazon's Career Choice program that pre-pays 95% of tuition for courses related to in-demand fields.Legal/RegulatoryACCC Takes Apple to Court: The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) has sued Apple for alleged false, misleading, or deceptive representations about consumers' rights under the Australian Consumer Law. The ACCC has found upon investigation that Apple generally avoided looking at or servicing a customer's device if he had earlier taken it to a third party, even if the third party's fix wasn't related to the defect before Apple. ACCC Chairman Rod Sims said, ""Consumer guarantee rights under the Australian Consumer Law exist independently of any manufacturer's warranty and are not extinguished simply because a consumer has goods repaired by a third party.""Germany Law on Fake News: Germany has created legislation that says that social networks will be fined as much as 50 million euros ($53 million) if they fail to give users the option to complain about hate speech and fake news or refuse to remove illegal content. Two categories were added to another bill that makes corporate officials responsible for noncompliance with fines up to $5 million. The first requires the compulsory removal of content that has been flagged as child porn. The second is really ridiculous but mentions content inciting terrorism. While Merkel's party backed these two inclusions, this bill hasn't been passed yet.Facebook Loses New York Case:  The New York Court of Appeals, while recognizing the privacy concerns, has upheld the decision of a lower court that Facebook didn't have the legal right to appeal a search warrants order in a criminal case. The case involves search warrants on 381 Facebook account holders who were allegedly involved in a disability benefits fraud case against New York City police and fire retirees. Five of the six judges were in favor of the ruling while the only dissenting judge said that Facebook was denied ""any meaningful recourse"" against the ""en masse"" data seizure. Facebook may take the matter to the federal courts.New Technology/ProductsFacebook Testing Workplace: Facebook is testing a free version of Workplace, the walled-off social networking service for office workers that it's referring to as the ""Standard"" edition. The paid version, called ""Premium"" is more secure, but offering the same basic services like chatting and collaboration, and including specialized versions of Facebook Live and News Feed. This is a crowded market including Microsoft's Teams, Slack and Google's Hangouts Chat (part of G Suite) although the others are yet to offer a free version.M&A and CollaborationsFacebook Collaboration in Korea: Facebook is planning on sprucing up its AR/VR tech by tapping into the Korean market. So it is working in collaboration with Korea Innovation Center (KIC) and the Institute for Information & Communications Technology Promotion (IITP), both managed by the Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning. As part of the ministry's Technology Revolution Together initiative, in which it seeks to help startups go global, it has identified 138 prospects eligible to work with Oculus, Facebook's VR arm, of which 30 have indicated interest.Amazon Deal with NFL: The National Football League has now given Amazon the rights to live stream 10 Thursday night football games for the 2017 season. Amazon is paying $50 million, which is 5x the 10 million Twitter paid last year. But then, Twitter is totally dependent on advertising, while for Amazon, advertising is more of an experiment (although on track to fetch a billion dollars this year). Amazon will be streaming to Prime members, so it must expect Prime member additions. This will of course help it sell much more than a football game (products, video, music, sports), which allows it to offer the higher price.Some NumbersApple Places Huge OLED Order: According to a report in the Nikkei Asian Review, which was based on a supply chain source, Samsung Electronics has received an order for OLED panels for 70 million iPhones this year. IHS Markit analyst David Hsieh forecasts the same number of phones and adds that Samsung is preparing to deliver OLEDs for 95 million phones in case demand exceeds supply, which is often the case. Apple is expected to launch three new iPhones this year.iPhone 8 Price Cut Likely: It had been rumored that Apple's new iPhone would cost somewhere around $1000, but it now appears that only the high-end model could reach that high. A research report from UBS analyst Steven Milunovich reportedly says that Apple usually prices its low-end model at the mid-range market. So since Samsung's new Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus phones with their 5.8-inch and 6.2-inch displays cost $720 and $840, respectively, Apple is also likely to price in the ballpark. But since the 64GB OLED iPhone will cost $70 to $90 higher, this means Apple will make a lower profit, so its gross margins will be something to watch.Android Is Most Popular OS: Mainly because of the smartphone becoming the primary device to access the Internet, the secular decline in traditional PC sales and the emergence of Asia as the biggest market for connected devices, Android is now the most popular OS for connecting to the Internet. StatCounter says that in March 2017, Android garnered a 37.93% share of Internet usage compared to Windows' 37.91%.While Microsoft still dominates the desktop, there's evidence that Google's Chrome is the most popular browser. Google's Android and Chrome strategies remain hazy and with these stats there are now renewed speculations about their merger.HPE Lowers Outlook: After the spin out and merger of its enterprise services group with Computer Sciences Corp, Hewlett Packard Enterprise lowered its second quarter EPS guidance from $0.43 to $0.35. The full-year guidance went from $1.93 to $1.51. The company also said that it expects a GAAP loss of 2 cents in the second quarter.Looking for Ideas with Even Greater Upside?Most of Zacks' investment ideas are short-term, directly based on our proven 1 to 3 month indicator.

Is iPhone's Supremacy as the Best Phone Coming to an End?;4/12/2017;"Apple Inc.AAPLhas long been regarded as a pioneer in the smartphone market, courtesy of its flagship device - iPhone. Although it was not the first smartphone - thanks to International Business Machines'IBMSimon - the device introduced a plethora of innovative features that has made it the ""most influential gadget of all time"", per TIME Magazine.makeArticleAd();According to NetworkWorld, Apple's most revolutionary iPhone innovations were Retina Display, App Store, 64-bit processor, multitouch, Touch ID, Apple Pay and 3D Touch. These features were primarily responsible for making iPhone, the top-selling premium smartphone device globally, until Android-based devices from Asian handset makers HTC and Samsung dragged down its market share.Neverthless, we note that iPhone has been the key growth driver for Apple over the last decade. Over the time period (Jan 9, 2007-Apr 11, 2017), Apple's stock price has soared a massive 1056.5% as compared with S&P 500's gain of 70.8%.Is iPhone Losing Innovative Edge?Per Gartner data, Apple had surpassed Samsung to become the #1 global smartphone vendor in fourth-quarter 2016, which the latter reclaimed in first-quarter 2017. (Read More:Samsung Retakes Top Spot in Global Smartphone Sales Race)Apple Inc. Revenue (TTM)Apple Inc. Revenue (TTM)|Apple Inc. QuoteApple is anticipated to make a big innovation leap with its much anticipated iPhone 8, with rumored features like a glass body, a dual curved edge-to-edge OLED display with a built-in Touch ID sensor, wireless charging (USB-C) and higher storage options.Although the rumored features are encouraging, they are more-or-less available in most of the Android-based smartphones from Samsung, HTC, AlphabetGOOGL, Motorola and BlackberryBBRY.For instance, HTC U Ultra (launched in Jan 2017) sports a glossy, all-glass body which the handset-maker built using an innovative approach it calls Liquid Surface construction, according to thenextweb.com. Moreover, Samsung's recently launched S8 and S8+ have Super AMOLED capacitive touch screen.Reportedly, Samsung Electronics will supply 70 million OLED screens for Apple's rumored iPhone 8. (Read More:Apple Reportedly Orders 70M OLED Screens from Samsung)Moreover, several smartphones from Samsung and few from Motorola & Blackberry already support wireless charging. In fact, Apple is significantly late in offering this feature to iPhone users.Premium Pricing: A Concern for AppleApple's iPhone 7 starting price is $650, which is quite pricey when compared with most of the Android-based devices. However, Samsung's recently released S8 and S8+ has been priced steeply at $750, which is definitely positive for iPhone 7.Meanwhile, the high-end iPhone 8 is rumored to cost more than $1000. However, the base 64GB model could start at $850-$900 in the US, which is still higher than the price of iPhone 7.Zacks RankCurrently, Apple carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Trade Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS) Stock and Win No Matter What;4/12/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSince the 2016 U.S. elections, banks have been on a tear. In particular,Goldman Sachs Group Inc(NYSE:GS) finally recovered the highs from 2007. They have since given back about $25 per share, but the fundamental outlook for GS stock still is promising.makeArticleAd();Source:Erik DrostAs long as President Trump is committed to loosening the regulatory strings, banks should have a shallow bottom. Furthermore, the U.S. Fed is in a tightening cycle and that also should provide support to GS stock.I am not one to chase target prices, so I am not calling for a buy signal here. In fact, I see a technical threat where GS could lose another $15 if it fails to rebound from here. If  that happens then the $200 area should provide some support since it has been pivotal and GS bulls are likely to fight for it once again.Regardless, looking at a decade of price range it is clear that the extreme lows are not likely to return under current conditions. Today, I want to sell downside risk below proven support levels.The idea is to create income by having my trade expire for maximum profit, so I chose levels that have been tested over ten years. Instead of chasing a price target, I will create income off someone else's doom scenario that I deem unlikely to occur.10 Blue-Chip Stocks That Will Bleed for the Rest of 2017The Trade:Sell the GS 2018 Jan $160 put naked for $3 per contract. This trade has a 90% theoretical chance of success. If GS stock falls below my strike, I am committed to owning it at $160. Anything below $157 per share would accrue losses. Essentially, I am being paid $3 for a chance to buy Goldman stock at a 29% discount from current levels.Selling naked puts is dangerous, however. That said, only do it if you are willing and able to own GS stock at the strike price. Alternatively, I can turn this trade into a Jan 2018 $165/$160 credit put spread. The advantage is that the spread has a finite risk profile and still yields 10% risk.As bank earnings begin this week, Goldman Sachs is scheduled to report after other mega-banks, such asCitigroup Inc(NYSE:C), so we could get a preview of how traders will react to GS earnings.Learn options as easy as 1-2-3here.

Do Millennials Care About Stocks?;4/12/2017;"Welcome to Episode #77 of the Zacks Market Edge Podcast.Every week, host and Zacks stock strategist, Tracey Ryniec, will be joined by guests to discuss the hottest investing topics in stocks, bonds and ETFs and how it impacts your life.In this episode, Tracey is joined by Ryan McQueeney, a Zacks Editor and also co-host of the weekly Friday Finish Line podcast with Maddy Johnson, and Parth Panchal, a Zacks intern and finance major at Loyola of Chicago, to discuss Millennials and investing.There's a myth that Millennials are all broke, living in their parents' basements, and have so much college debt it prohibits them from doing things, like investing some spare cash in the stock market.But a host of apps like Robinhood, which makes it nearly free for Millennials to trade, appear to be changing that.Do Millennials Care About Stocks?Tracey asked Ryan and Parth, two Millennials who, yes, also have an interest in finance so they are slightly biased, just what they and their friends invest in.Yes, they are buying stocks. Yes, even the history major, non-finance Millennials are interested. No, they're not buying ETFs.They like stocks that are highly volatile and have room to the upside such as the social media stocks or the biotechs.They also invest in what they know.As Parth said, ""Millennials like to have something in their hands"" so that means when they invest, they like to know, and most likely, love, the company they are buying. They are emotional investors.It's not surprising, then, that companies that feature prominently in Millennials lives are also among the more popular stocks.What Are Millennials Buying?1.       The Snapchat IPO (SNAP) was big among the younger Millennials. They are the original users of the product so they know it inside and out.2.       Facebook (FB) skews older but Millennials grew up using it. They cannot imagine a world without it so they also like the stock.3.       Tesla (TSLA) is another popular stock, not because they can afford to buy one of the cars, but because they like to think they can in the future. They like to buy stock in companies they believe in.4.       Alphabet (GOOGL) owns one of the most popular brands in the world, YouTube, but Millennial investors aren't really buying the stock. Why not? Tracey asked Parth and Ryan why Alphabet is left out in the cold.Where Do Millennials Get Their News?Millennials have short attention spans. They like to read headlines. But Millennial traders still need to get their financial news somewhere.Tracey was surprised to find out the top source of financial news for Millennials. You won't believe it either. Tune in!What other issues are on the minds of Millennials about stocks and investing?Find out the answer to this and more on this week's podcast.Zacks' Top 10 Stocks for 2017makeArticleAd();In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2017?Who wouldn't?

Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Won’t Hit $1000 Like This;4/12/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOver the past few years,Alphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) has made a concerted effort to diversify from its legacy Google Search business. Like rivalAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) andMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet took to the cloud and other initiatives it hopes will pay off for GOOGL stock.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockThe company's Waymo unit is developing self-driving cars. ""Learning thermostat"" Google Nest and Google Home provide an entry into the Internet of Things realm; Google Fiber provides high-speed internet access; and the Verily unit provides research in life sciences.As GOOGL stock tries to return to an all-time high reached in mid-March, the potential growth opportunities beyond Google Search are a big part of the bull case.So far, those investments aren't really moving the needle:88% of Alphabet's 2016 revenue still came from advertising, per the company's 10-K. That is a potential problem for GOOGL stock holders. The online advertising business doesn't seem particularly healthy at the moment.Google's YouTube lost a number of clients in Europe amid concerns about the type of content being run next to advertisements. The shift to mobile creates a continuing headwind in terms of pricing. 2016 growth numbers were impressive, but competition from social media providers may limit that growth going forward.The 11 Best Dividend Stocks to BuyThat leaves GOOGL stock somewhat reliant on non-Search initiatives, and in particular what the company calls its ""Other Bets."" And in many of those efforts, Alphabet appears to be falling behind.GOOGL Stock Is at RiskIt might seem premature, if not downright silly, to express concern about Alphabet's core advertising business. Concerns about cost-per-click (CPC) rates did pressure GOOGL stock a few years back, but growth was impressive in 2016. Overall revenue increased 20%, despite 4 points of currency headwinds.Google-owned properties saw growth accelerate to 22% from 16% the year before. The AdSense business (which Google refers to as Google Network Members) is seeing smaller sales increases, but still grew more than 3% in each of the past two years. Meanwhile, ""other"" Google revenue jumped up 41%, which the 10-K attributed to app sales through Google Play.Looking forward, however, there are legitimate concerns. Competition is only going to increase, in particular from social media giantsFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) andSnap Inc(NYSE:SNAP). Both companies - along withTwitter Inc(NYSE:TWTR), although I'm highly skeptical of TWTR's chances - can offer more direct, more personally tailored advertising options. And, of course, Amazon represents a real threat to Alphabet. That company hasa strong ad opportunity of its own, and at least one analyst believes the Amazon Echo couldpressure the entire search modellonger-term.Even in recent numbers, there are concerns. The most notable is that cost-per-click continues to decline, largely a result of the continuing shift to mobile. The AdSense business is rather stagnant at this point. Growth in Android usage and increasing share for the Chrome browser and Google Docs have helped, but those tailwinds will fade, if only due to the already-large proportion Google owns in both markets.There's a real, ""okay, then what?"" concern about what happens to GOOGL stock once ""click growth"" slows.Alphabet Isn't WinningWith GOOGL stock still pricing in a reasonable amount of growth, Alphabet must succeed beyond advertising. Its early efforts haven't been promising, asNest simply hasn't grownthe way Google expected. What's more, two key executives on theGoogle Fiber project were reassigned last week, implying a retreat from that initiative; Google Home is behind the Echo; and Google's cloud hosting similarly trails both Amazon and Microsoft's Azure.Waymo's role in self-driving cars is yet to be determined, admittedly. The Pixel smartphone is an opportunity (although many companies have failed in that space, including Amazon and Microsoft). And investors do need to remember that the company is spending lavishly outside of Search.The ""Other Bets"" category lost about $3 billion last year, a significant headwind to earnings (almost $4 per share after-tax). Even if Alphabet has to pull back on some of these initiatives - as appears to be the case with Google Fiber - earnings will benefit. But if ad growth slows to single-digit growth, there's probably not enough to support the current price of GOOGL stock.GOOGL Stock Looks FamiliarAll told, GOOGL stock is more dangerous than it looks. Alphabet's current situation reminds me quite a bit of what Microsoft looked like at the end of the past decade. Microsoft's dominant PC platforms - Windows and Office - were still growing, but it was clear that pressure was on the way. For the most part, Microsoft's efforts to diversify did not work.Buy These 3 Airline Stocks Instead of United Continental Holdings Inc Stock (UAL)MSFT stock subsequently traded at a low-teen multiple to earnings, barely moving for several years until optimism surrounding ""the cloud"" provided a tailwind.It's not hard to imagine a similar fate for GOOGL stock over the next few years. If advertising slows, as seems likely, and Alphabet can't find a secondary driver, which seems possible, then GOOGL isn't going to hit $1,000 or anywhere close. That's one possible scenario investors need to keep in mind.As of this writing, Vince Martin did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 Blue-Chip Stocks That Will Bleed for the Rest of 20177 Tech Stocks That Are a Sneeze Away From CollapsingAlibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA) Stock's Breakout Is a Fake-OutThe postAlphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Won't Hit $1000 Like Thisappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Fitbit (FIT) Shares Down More Than 3% on Watch Launch Delay;4/12/2017;"Activity tracker and fitness device makerFitbit, Inc.FIThas reportedly been facing difficulties with the fabrication of its next smart watch product, which has delayed the launch of its new smartphone.Following the news, shares of the company were down by 3.29%. Notably, the company's shares have lost a mammoth 56.5% since Jun 18, 2016, the day on which the company began trading on the New York stock exchange.Over the last one year, shares of Fitbit have been persistently declining. The stock lost 67.25% compared with the ZacksElectronics - Measuring Instrumentsindustry's decline of 0.82%.Why the Fall in Share Price?As per reports from Yahoo! Finance, Fitbit was to launch its smartwatch this spring, but had to delay it due to certain technical problems.Firstly, the GPS antenna had to be redesigned to improve signal performance. Secondly, the watch had some issues with the waterproofing feature. Given that waterproofing is an important feature of smarwatches, any compromise on it can impact the company's sales figures.Downward Estimate RevisionsFor the full year, three estimates moved down in the last 60 days, compared with one upward revision. This resulted in the consensus estimate declining from earnings of 29 cents a share 60 days ago to its current level of a loss of 62 cents.Also, for the current quarter, Fitbit saw one downward estimate revision, which dragged the consensus estimate to a loss of 25 cents a share from a loss of 5 cents in the last 60 days.ConclusionFitbit enjoys a leading market position and is a global brand for wearable activity tracking devices and its recent performance proves that.The company, however, faces competition in both the high and low-end product ranges. At the high-end front, it competes with the AppleAAPLWatch. Also, many big manufacturers are developing connected devices on Google'sGOOGLAndroid operating system. At the low end, fitness-tracking devices from Jawbone, Garmin Ltd and Xiaomi also pose tough competition. Recently, Fossil Group also joined the ranks.Competition is on the rise and it might compel Fitbit to slash prices to maintain market share. This in turn can take a toll on its margins.Zacks Rank & Stock to ConsiderCurrently, Fitbit carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Two Reasons To Own Apple (AAPL) Stock, Not Trade It;4/12/2017;"Apple (Shutterstock photo)Since reaching a 52-week high last week of $145.46, shares of Apple (AAPL) has apparently hit a speed bump, falling as much as 3.7% when account factoring its $140.06 low on Monday. Critics, who have long clamored for “peak Apple” or “ripen Apple” insist this recent decline is the “aha moment” they’ve warned about.Despite the recent pullback, Apple stock — up 22% year to date — is still easily the best-performer in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, exceeding the respective 14% and 13% returns made by Boeing (BA) and Visa (V). And yet there’s evidence that the Cupertino-based tech giant, which has madeWarren Buffettlook even smarter than perceived, can continue its winning streak. Here are two reasons to own Apple stock and not trade it.makeArticleAd();A No-Brainer BargainEven with its status as the Dow’s top performer, AAPL stock remains the clear-cut best bargain among the blue chips. And its massive cash stockpile of more than $250 billion has a lot to do with that. The company is expected to earn $8.95 per share for fiscal 2017, which puts its forward P/E of around 15.8, which is about three points below the average stock in the S&P 500 index. Adjusting out Apple’s cash and the P/E falls near 10.In other words, Apple is not being accurately judged on its growth capabilities — not compared to, say Alphabet (GOOGL) or Facebook (FB), which are both priced at forward P/Es of 25. Just assigning a reasonable multiple of 18 to AAPL stock yields price of around $160. Add in Apple’s 1.59% annual dividend yield and you’ve got a company with a combination of growth, value, income and safety — making it a no-brainer investment.iPhone 8 on TapThis year marks the 10th anniversary of the iPhone and Wall Street anticipates the mobile device's super-cycle to to rejuvenate demand. Apple surprised investors in the first quarter with a 5% jump in unit sales, which topped Street forecasts. But all sorts of sales records are expect to fall this year as current iPhone owners, who postponed upgrading last year, will rush to buy the new device. This is because, unlike previous iterations, Apple is expected to drastically depart from just making minor enhancements.Rumors suggest that the tenth-anniversary iPhone, which will feature a new OLED display and an integrated on-screen home button, could sell for more than $1,000 per device. It remains to be seen whether this price point is accurate. But given the sticky nature of iPhones and the loyal following Apple’s ecosystem has developed, the value of said ecosystem is what consumers are paying for. And with only one chance at a tenth-anniversary launch, Apple and its investors are in the right place at the right time."

Yelp Stock Spikes on Pacific Crest Upgrade, Sees Advantage Unmatched By Competitors;4/11/2017;"Yelp Inc.YELPclosed up 1.94% to $33.37 on Tuesday with a key analyst upgrade.

He is talking about how businesses feel that Yelp is the most effective way to reach consumers who are ready to decide where to eat or get a haircut.The equity research team had conversations with 30 local ad customers.

How Chesapeake Energy Corporation (CHK) Stock Could Double;4/11/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsChesapeake Energy Corporation(NYSE:CHK) analysts expect CHK to turn a profit of 75 cents per share this year. Next year, that could easily rise to above $1 per share. Its sales growth should average 15% a year in the next couple of years and total sales could reach $11 billion by the end of 2018. Even with depressed oil prices, Chesapeake Energy is well on the way to doubling.makeArticleAd();Source:Philadelphia 76ers Via FlickrAccording to an article inthe Economistmagazine last year, more than 90% of producers can turn a buck even if oil prices fall to $30 per barrel.That's because oil-rich countries, such as Iran and Saudi Arabia, operate national oil giants that can extract a barrel of oil (or an equivalent, such as natural gas) out of the ground for less than $10 per barrel. U.S.-based shale producers have production costs closer to $15 per barrel.The above helps explain why OPEC, the giant oil cartel, hasn't had much luck with cutting production to try and boost oil prices. Even at $50 per barrel, which is still half what it sold for a couple of years ago, most producers can still make a profit by producing at their existing wells.The Appeal of Chesapeake EnergyChesapeake Energy shares currently trade at just over $6 per share, so at first glance the single digit price-earnings ratio looks quite compelling. Unfortunately, the company is being punished for its past when it spent billions of dollars buying oil and gas fields back when energy was booming and oil prices were around $100 per barrel.That buying binge resulted in a rather large write-down of many properties in its portfolio. In 2015, itwrote off $18.2 billionof those investments and lost $22.43 per share. It also pushed shareholders' equity (or book value) into negative territory, meaning the company has lost money for shareholders since it was founded.Yet, the company has stayed in business, and conditions are improving. Last year's loss was only $6.45 per share (compared to $22.43 previously) and debt is being whittled down by asset sales. Total long-term debt ended last year below $10 billion. Its gas properties are valued on the books at $66.5 billion, and its total portfolio qualifies it as one of the largest natural gas producers in the United States.Shale gas producers, or those that rely on fracking to extract oil and gas from the ground, have proven frustratingly resilient to OPEC. They continuously innovate to lower production costs and stay afloat, even though energy costs remain depressed.Despite its past overinvestment at the peak of the market, Chesapeake Energy is still a major player in the industry. Yet the market still has concerns about its survival.CHK plans to reduce debt by $2 billion to $3 billion""over the next few years through additional asset sales.""It has a net-debt-to-Ebitda (one of the most common ways to analyze how large a firm's debt load is) goal of 2x, which would make its overall debt load quite manageable.As with most companies, future cash flow is key for CHK stock. But in Chesapeake's case, it is especially important. Its stated goal is to ""achieve cash flow neutrality in 2018.""Bottom Line on Chesapeake EnergyDebt-rating firm Moody's hasa positive outlookon much of Chesapeake's outstanding debt. It has noted that the company is reducing debt and plans to generate positive cash flow as soon as is reasonably possibly. It sees plenty of available liquidity, meaning the firm should be able to continue to raise debt as needed.Moody's would likely downgrade Chesapeake's debt if production growth slows again, cash flow goals aren't met or liquidity dries up. These situations seem unlikely, and the fact the company is expected to report a profit while oil prices are low, is encouraging.As with most energy producers, Chesapeake Energy would breathe a huge sigh of relief if oil prices increased from current levels. A jump to $60 a share or more in oil prices could cause CHK stock to rally rather significantly, as earnings would increase further and liquidity concerns would be further allayed.But as it stands currently, even with $50 oil, CHK should be able to work to improve its balance sheet and boost cash flow. If it can keep its operations stable, shares could easily double from current levels, and that would represent an earnings multiple in the low-teens, based off analyst profit expectations from next year.Chesapeake's low P/E also compares favorably to rivals.Range Resources Corp.(NYSE:RRC) trades at more than 30 times earnings expectations for 2018.Antero Resources Corp(NYSE:AR) is more reasonable at 17x for the same period, but this is still well below Chesapeake's multiple.Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock: $1 Trillion Doesn't MatterInvesting in CHK stock represents a higher risk/higher potential reward play in the industry. Trouble could appear if oil happens to slide back toward $30 per barrel. In this respect, safer and more diversified players, includingExxon Mobil Corporation(NYSE:XOM) orBp plc (ADR)(NYSE:BP), make more sense.As of this writing, Ryan Fuhrmann was long CHK stock.More From InvestorPlaceThe 11 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy11 A-Plus Stocks That Are on Bernstein's 'Buy List'Buy Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock With 16% OffThe postHow Chesapeake Energy Corporation (CHK) Stock Could Doubleappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Why Facebook Is Doubling Down on Its AI;4/11/2017;"Imagine the computing power necessary to handle the activity   of 1.23 billion users playing 100 million hours of video and   uploading 95 million posts of photos and videos.Facebook, Inc.(NASDAQ: FB) processes that and more every day. Now imagine   sifting through all that data to perform facial recognition,   describe the contents of photos and video, and populate your news   feed with relevant content. Those tasks are all handled by   Facebook's servers that have been infused with its homegrownbrand of artificial intelligence(AI).The training that takes place behind the scenes has been the   job of Facebook's AI brain named Big Sur, which has been handling   the task since 2015. Now, the system that has been at the heart   of the company's AI activity for the last two years is being   replaced by a newer, faster model. Facebook revealed in ablog postthat its successor is dubbed Big Basin, and this new platform   boasts some impressive credentials. The upgraded AI server can   train machine-learning models that are 30% larger in about half   the time.Facebook data center in Prineville, Oregon. Image source:     Facebook.makeArticleAd();If you've used Facebook, you've used AIMachine learning is a combination of software models and   algorithms that sort through data at lightning speeds to make   deductions based on what it finds. This might sound somewhat   futuristic, but this AI technology is being used today. An   example would be running facial recognition and comparing a newly   uploaded photo with all the photos in its database to suggest a   name when tagging a friend in the picture. ""If you've logged into   Facebook, it's very likely you've used some type of AI system   we've been developing,"" according to Kevin Lee, a technical   program manager at Facebook and author of the blog.Lee detailed that the new system was built using graphics   processing units (GPUs) fromNVIDIA Corporation(NASDAQ: NVDA) to achieve this new level of AI computing. The   platform hosts eight Tesla P100 GPU accelerators, which NVIDIA   describes as ""the most advanced data center GPU ever built."" The   system also features NVIDIA NVLink, which connects the GPUs in   what Facebook describes as a ""hybrid mesh cube."" The speed of   these systems can bog down, caused by a bottleneck at the   connections, which the NVLink seeks to prevent. Lee indicated   that the architecture was similar NVIDIA's DGX-1 -- its AI   supercomputer in a box. Lee quipped that ""Big Basin behaves like   a JBOD [just a bunch of disks] -- or as we call it, JBOG, just a   bunch of GPUs.""More computing power was necessaryFacebook's recent emphasis on live video streaming provided   challenges because of how quickly it was adopted by users. Larger   and more complex data sets required additional computing power at   higher speeds. The company uses AI to not only classify its   real-time video but in other applications, such as speech and   text translations. This new platform provides the data capacity   and speed to train Facebook's next generation of AI models.Facebook plans to release the design specifications of its AI   server via the Open Compute Project in the near future. Once that   happens, any ambitious computer engineer with sufficient time and   money could conceivably build one of these systems in his or her   basement.Big Basin AI Server can train 30% larger data sets than its     predecessor in half the time! Image source: Facebook.Groundbreaking AI chipFacebook isn't the only company creating innovative AI   applications.Alphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) Google revealed the details   behind its Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), a specialized chip it   designed and has been using to power its AI systems -- called   deep neural networks -- for the last two years. These   machine-learning systems are created using algorithms and   software modeled on the human brain, and they learn by analyzing   vast quantities of data.In aGoogle blog post, hardware engineer Norm Jouppi described the capabilities of the   TPU chip, saying that it processed AI workloads 15 to 30 times   faster than conventional CPUs and GPUs while achieving a 30 to 80   times reduction in energy consumption. Google realized six years   ago that the AI speech-recognition technology that it was   deploying to users required the storage of vast amounts of data,   and worried that it would have to double the number of data   centers just to keep up. Google credits the development of TPU   for improvements in its Translate, Image Search, and Photos   programs, and for itsvictory over world's best Go players.Final thoughtsIt would be difficult to quantify the value these innovations   bring to the companies that develop them, and even more so since   they are being shared with the world. Very few of the companies   involved in AI research reveal any direct financial benefit,   though the advances make their products more useful to consumers,   as the resulting technologies affect the things we do and the   products we use every day.10 stocks we like better than FacebookWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

I usually go long GOOGl stock on dips, but in this animal-spirited equity market we are not getting any significant pullbacks. This makes finding entry points difficult for most investors.makeArticleAd();Source:Brionv via Wikimedia (Modified)But I don't have to stay out. Using the options market, I can find long GOOGL trades at almost any time. Just recently when GOOGL was near its all-time high, I shared along trade that paidwell and quickly. Today, I will set another trade to profit long GOOGL with relative confidence.Instead of buying GOOGL stock and risking $840 per share at these elevated levels, I will instead sell risk below proven support. Rather than chasing Alphabet's target price, I risk money at levels where price is not likely to go. In essence, I'd be selling someone else a lotto ticket that is a loser by design.The Trade:Sell the GOOGL 2018 June $700 naked put and collect $23 per contract. This trade has an 85% theoretical chance of success by having my sold puts expire worthless for maximum gains.By selling naked puts, I commit to buying GOOGL stock at $700 if it falls below it. Anything below $677 per share would accrue losses for me. So in essence, I am getting paid for the opportunity to buy $GOOGL stock at a 16% discount from current levels.This trade is not suited for everyone so for a tamer version of this I can turn it into a $700/$690 credit put spread with the same metrics only with a limited risk profile.

The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights: Alphabet, Ford, Tesla Motors, Apple, Snap and Twilio;4/11/2017;"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL - April 11, 2017 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog includeAlphabet Inc.(NASDAQ:GOOGL-Free Report),Ford(NYSE:F-Free Report),Tesla Motors(NASDAQ:TSLA-Free Report),Apple(NASDAQ:AAPL-Free Report),Snap Inc.(NYSE:SNAP-Free Report) andTwilio Inc.(NYSE:TWLO-Free Report).Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations.Get #1Stock of the Day pick for free.Here are highlights from Monday's Analyst Blog:Will Uber Be the Hottest IPO of 2017?y now, I think we all know what Uber is, what it does, and how it makes our lives easier. Have too many groceries? Get an Uber. Too drunk? Get an Uber. Stressful day at work? Uber. Like magic-now, it's really an expectation-any transportation woes vanish with the digital sight of a car heading your way.Launched only seven years ago,Uber Technologies Inc.is an app-based transportation company headquartered in San Francisco, California, and operates in about 270 cities and more than 60 countries worldwide. Using the app is easy: just type in your current location, where you want to go, and hit request Uber. From there, Uber uses its app to receive its ride requests, sending them out to drivers who transport customers to their final destination.Increased CompetitionThe emergence of on-demand rides has become a popular business venture all over the world, but it has proved difficult for companies to break away from the congested pack. At the end of 2015, Sidecar, another on-demand car service, officially stopped offering rides and deliveries.In addition to the now-defunct Sidecar, companies like Lyft, Curb, Southeast Asia-based Grab, India's Ola, and especially China's Didi Chuxing have all started to eat into the ride-hailing market share, becominghuge competitorsfor Uber. Didi is arguably Uber's biggest threat overseas, and the ride-sharing giant conceded defeat in August,selling its UberChina operationsto Didi and ending an expensive, bruising battle between the two companies.Even Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL-Free Report) is becoming a threat to Uber, with plans to make its self-driving cars unit a stand-alone business. This initiative could put the company in direct competition with Uber, as the lack of a driver could keep costs down in the long-term. The company's Google division also recently began a pilot program with Waze, a company they acquired in 2013, that enables thousands of San Francisco commuters to join carpools; Waze also offers real-time driving directions based on information from other drivers.Self-Driving, Uber StyleBut Uber is right on Google's heels, and asself-driving car technologybecomes more commercially available, Uber has been constantly beefing up its business strategies focused on autonomous driving. Back in September, it began testing its self-driving Ford (NYSE:F-Free Report) Fusions in Pittsburgh; engineers rode in the driver's seat, ready to take over whenever things got tricky.Uber then introduced self-driving Volvo XC90s to San Francisco in December, and riders who requested an uberX were matched with one of these vehicles if one was available. Just days later, however, the California Department of Motor Vehicles revoked the registrations for its self-driving cars, as the company didn't have the proper permits.But Uber being Uber, the fleet of Volvos were on their way to Arizona within days. Uber already operates a self-driving car program in the state, and in 2015, partnered with the University of Arizona to research mapping technology.Uber also recently acquired a car start-up Otto, which specializes in self-driving trucks. Otto is a 90-person company, and its co-founder, Anthony Levandowski, will now lead Uber into the self-driving car market. Impressively, Otto engineers have worked at Tesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA-Free Report), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL-Free Report), and Google, and with this knowledge and expertise, Uber is bound to be a top player in the self-driving car industry.ControversyWhile Uber has seen great success, it's journey has been a bumpy one. The company has been in and out of the news thanks to a number of recent legal (Alphabet iscurrently suingthem for theft of its self-driving car technology) and reputation-hurting (note the company'ssexual harassment scandaland CEO Travis Kalanick's rude behavior towards a driver) headlines. And from noncompliance issues in New York City to regulatory concerns and lack of driver background checks, Uber has drawn scrutiny and criticism, and has even been banned in The Netherlands and in parts of Thailand, India, and China.It's no secret that traditional taxi services are not happy with the rise of Uber and other ride-hailing companies, and many argue that Uber should be subject to the same regulations that they face. In dozens of cities it has moved in to, Uber has faced intense opposition, lobbying, and legal challenges against it from these taxi companies.Uber has also been embroiled in along-standing battlewith its drivers. A group of drivers first sued the company back in 2013, claiming they should be classified as employees rather than independent contractors. As a result, Uber had been set to pay up to $100 million in reimbursement damages to almost 400,000 drivers, but recently, a federal judge in California ruled that the settlement was unfair.But as the saying goes, any publicity is good publicity, and all of the bad press has yet to really negatively affect Uber. Despitelosing over $1 billionin the first half of 2016, Uber gained just as much revenue in that same time period. Its ability to raise exorbitant amounts of money is incredibly impressive for a company who is less than a decade old, and this skill makes Uber that much more attractive to venture capital investors.IPO PotentialDespite these controversies, investors are eagerly awaiting an Uber IPO. Many have believed, or hoped, the company would go public for a few years now, but Mr. Kalanick wants ""to make sure [an IPO] happens as late as possible,"" said in an interview with CNBC last year.If and when Uber finally decides to go public, its potential would depend on the broader IPO market and economic environment. According to Renaissance Capital, IPOs only raised a paltry $18.9 billion in 2016, with annual proceeds falling to the lowest level since 2003. Just four companies filed public offerings that grossed over $1 billion.Looking ahead, it's difficult to pinpoint how busy the IPO market will be this year. Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP-Free Report), the parent company of Snapchat, finally made that giant step last month, but it's hard to say what, and if any, other high-profile unicorns-i.e. Spotify, Pinterest, Airbnb, and yes, Uber-will follow. And recent high-growth IPOs like Twilio Inc. (NYSE:TWLO-Free Report) have traded strongly since their debut, a good sign for tech companies everywhere looking to make their trading debut.How Might Uber Perform?An IPO for Uber could be massive for both the company and Wall Street. It's currently valued at $68 billion after a total of nine rounds of funding worth $12.9 billion since its launch. And thanks to Uber's structure-a unique combination of transportation company, mobile Internet company, and real world engineering-the company has been touted as one of the best future IPOs.It's IPO, then, could go either way, but let one number stay in your mind: $68 billion. Let me write that again: $68 billion. This number is a hard one to forget, and a figure that will be on the forefront of many investors' minds come the time of its public offering, as it impressively showcases just how far this startup has come in a few short years.Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations.Get #1 Stock of the Day pick for free.About Zacks Equity ResearchZacks Equity Research provides the best of quantitative and qualitative analysis to help investors know what stocks to buy and which to sell for the long-term.Continuous coverage is provided for a universe of 1,150 publicly traded stocks.

The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights: Amazon, Alphabet, Facebook, Microsoft and IBM;4/11/2017;"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL - April 11, 2017 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog includeAmazon(NASDAQ:AMZN-Free Report),Alphabet(NASDAQ:GOOGL-Free Report),Facebook(NASDAQ:FB-Free Report),Microsoft(NASDAQ:MSFT-Free Report) andIBM(NYSE:IBM-Free Report).Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations.Get #1Stock of the Day pick for free.Here are highlights from Monday's Analyst Blog:Amazon and Google: Head to Head?Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN-Free Report) and Google are increasingly pitted against each other in all the markets in which they operate. But who will be the winner is a harder question to answer. As things stand now, the scales are evenly balanced, but who knows what the next decade will see?Competition for Ad DollarsLast week, a couple of analysts had things to say about Amazon's advertising business, which has been gaining momentum in recent months.BMO Capital's Daniel Salmon has said that the leading online retailer was stealthily creeping up on Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL-Free Report)-owned Google and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB-Free Report) and would steal digital advertising dollars from the market leaders. He thinks Amazon's North America ""Other"" segment (attributed mostly to advertising) will grow 65% to $3.5 billion this year.eMarketer estimates that Amazon will generate more than a 1 billion dollars in U.S. ad revenue in 2017 compared to Google's $34 billion and Facebook's $15 billion. But more importantly, Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak estimates that this number will grow to $5 billion next year and $7 billion by 2020.It's apparent that Amazon is far from catching up with the leaders, but the thing to note here is that it has all that is required to have a very successful advertising business, so it may not be long before it is more than an experiment.At the moment, Amazon mostly shows targeted ads to people based on their browsing patterns and buying decisions, whether it's with respect to products or media. This therefore appears less intrusive and safeguards customer experience.Its store house of customer data is very attractive for advertisers but can be a serious privacy concern if shared with them. Amazon reportedly doesn't offer more than a broad description of a customer such as a ""tech geek"" or ""fashionista"" that advertisers can target, but it has the capability to offer more. For now, advertisers aren't complaining.Competition for Voice Controlled PlatformsAmazon has the lead in online retail, but that isn't the only lead it has. The company's Echo devices are going great guns and help it sell products and services. The artificial intelligence (AI) driven voice assistant Alexa has already been worked into a host of other everyday devices for the digital home and there are agreements to get it into even more. So Amazon is racing to build an ecosystem around Alexa and it's safe to say that it's taken an early lead.The opportunity is not lost on Google of course, which also has its Google Assistant powering Google Home that can personalize your experience probably more completely (when linked to your Google profile) and also help you search for pretty much everything under the sun.Selling ads on voice controlled devices isn't cool yet, but Google may have tried something that wasn't too well-received that it later said was a mistake. Since ads for the platform are yet to be figured out, Amazon has a better model at the moment, because it isn't just selling the device but through it, also products that customers need.Competition for Cloud Infrastructure ServicesHere again, Amazon has the lead with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT-Free Report) in hot pursuit. While some place Google in the third position, others say it is preceded by IBM (NYSE:IBM-Free Report).According to Canalys, Cloud infrastructure services generated $10.3 billion in the fourth quarter, of which Amazon's AWS alone accounted for 33.8% while Microsoft, Google and IBM together accounted for 30.8%. The market is expected to grow 46% this year from $38.1 billion to $55.8 billion. So there's plenty of room for all the players to grow.Amazon seems to be expanding the fastest because of its first mover advantage, adding 11 new availability zones globally. Google added its first in Japan. Google's advantage is that it already has servers in major regions because of its ubiquitous search engine. So it can probably expand by building those out further. But it has a very long way to go to catch up with Amazon, and also Microsoft, which has its strong product range and enterprise customer base to fall back on.ConclusionGoogle is in for some very tough competition, which will likely unfold over the next five years or so. As things stand now, Amazon looks very strongly positioned to take in some nice profits, both from AWS and its advertising business that can help it offset effect of aggressive pricing in the retail business.Zacks' Hidden TradesWhile we share many recommendations and ideas with the public, certain moves are hidden from everyone but selected members of our portfolio services.

Q1 Likely to See Strongest Earnings Since 2011: Top 5 Picks;4/11/2017;"The 'America First' plan might have fueled a solid market rally, but, investors are presently on the lookout for strong earnings growth. The S&P 500 companies are set to release their earnings numbers and projections in the middle of April.Going by the estimated numbers, the S&P 500 companies are set to post their first quarter of double-digit profit gains in more than two years, while earnings growth may also turn out to be the best since late 2011. Strength in the global economy coupled with Trump's promises of fewer regulations will certainly help companies come up with strong performances. Consumer confidence is at a 16-year high, which could also mean higher sales and profits for many companies. The jobs market has also been showing steady improvement.Over the next couple of weeks, let us keep an eye on stocks that are likely to make the most of the first-quarter earnings season. Here, we should also bear in mind that better-than-expected earnings performances generally lead to a rally in the share price.Q1 Earnings Numbers Should be Really GoodAccording to estimates, total first-quarter earnings for the S&P 500 cohort are expected to be up 6.5% from same period last year on 6.3% higher revenues. Actual earnings growth, however, is expected to be as high as 10.4% (read more:Q1 Earnings Season Gets Underway).And if that happens, it will be the first double-digit increase since the third quarter of 2014. Furthermore, it will be the best quarter of growth in about five years, the highest since the companies posted 11.6% growth in the fourth quarter of 2011. The improvement will also follow a 7.4% increase - the highest in two years - in the preceding quarter.A strong earnings season does justify pricey stock valuations, with the S&P 500 scaling to its most expensive level since 2004 on a forward price-to-earnings basis. The S&P 500 components are expected to come up with strong results, thanks to strength in the global economy. Almost half the S&P 500 components generate their revenues from overseas. Euro zone business activity is at a six-year high, while forecasts from the International Monetary Fund show a pickup in the global economy in 2017 and 2018, especially in developing economies.Needless to say, the U.S. economy has also received a lot of attention since President Trump's election. His promises of deregulations and tax reforms have bolstered investors' sentiments. If Trump and Republicans manage to recover cash stashed overseas at a lower rate, this could set earnings in a higher gear. Tech behemoths including Apple Inc.AAPL, Microsoft CorporationMSFTand Alphabet IncGOOGLwill use some of this cash and invest more in the U.S. by building plants and hiring skilled labor.Potential Gainers & Losers of Q1Financials and tech firms are expected to post solid gains. For the Finance sector as a whole, total Q1 earnings are expected to be up 5.4% from the same period last year on 2.9% higher revenues. This would follow 6.7% earnings growth in the fourth quarter of 2016 on 6.3% higher revenues. Bank majors like JPMorgan ChaseJPM, Wells FargoWFCand CitigroupCamong others will kick off the earnings season this week. Bank stocks have been maintaining their uptrend since the election, with theBanks - Major Regionalindustry surging 23.6% since Nov 8 (read more:Can Banks Get Their Mojo Back?).Earnings for the Technology sector is set to grow 10.7% from the same period last year, while Industrials sectors are anticipated to rise in mid-single digits. Big profits are expected from materials as well. A huge jump in earnings for energy companies is also expected owing to substantially higheroil pricesthan a year ago. The Energy sector is expected to earn $8.1 billion in Q1, in contrast to a loss of $1.6 billion in the year-earlier quarter.The table below shows what is expected from the different sectors in Q1, compared with what was achieved in the preceding quarter.Buy These 5 Stocks for Stellar Earnings GrowthInvestors have been gripped with politics lately. However, over the next few weeks, the Wall Street is likely to focus less on Trump's America First program and more on Corporate America. This calls for investing in five companies from the aforesaid sectors, which are expected to report a significant uptick in first-quarter earnings.These stocks have a positiveEarnings ESP.

Qualcomm (QCOM) Counter Attacks Apple on its Allegations;4/11/2017;"Qualcomm Inc.QCOM, the largest mobile chipset manufacturer using baseband technology globally, has counter attacked tech giantApple Inc.AAPLin relation to the last $1 billion lawsuit filed by the latter in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California in Jan 2017. Apple had accused Qualcomm of overcharging for chips and refusing to pay some $1 billion in promised rebates.In its response, Qualcomm clearly mentioned the value of its invented technologies, their contribution and share in the industry through its licensing program. The filing also details Apple's illegal and improper handling of agreements and negotiations with device manufacturers, misleading regulators to attack Qualcomm around the world and not utilizing the full performance of Qualcomm's modem chips in its iPhone7. Reports also state that Apple had even warned Qualcomm against publicizing the better performance of iPhones with Qualcomm chips.Considering all the damages incurred, Qualcomm henceforth wants Apple not to further interfere with its agreements with the manufacturers of iPhones and iPads.The legal battle is basically centered around a high-stakes dispute between the two companies.Also, just a couple of days before the filing of Apple's lawsuit, Qualcomm had faced an anti-trust lawsuit from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. The regulator filed a lawsuit with the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California claiming that the company used anticompetitive measures to maintain a monopoly in baseband chipset market.Intel Corp.INTCand Media Tek are closest competitors of Qualcomm in this field.

Facebook Inc (FB) Is the Dark Horse of the Cloud Space;4/11/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhenFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) first went public in 2012, and investors had to wait over a year for Facebook stock to get back to its $35 per share opening, analysts asked if there was room in the market for the social network.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockNow, with Facebook stock at almost $142 per share and powering higher, there are some who believe, likeInvestorPlacecontributor Vince Martin, thatthere could be room for several.At least room forSnap Inc(NYSE:SNAP).My guess is that there isn't, that there is only one Facebook, and will be only one FB stock. The reason I feel that way can be found on a former corn field near Omaha.It is the start of a huge new data center -Facebook's ninth.This particular center will bewind-powered, but more importantly, it will be massive at almost 1 million square feet.The data center build-out tells me FB stock is about more than social, and more than advertising, more even than itself.Facebook stock is about cloud, and that is important.FB Stock: Scale Is About FreedomFacebook committed itself to building its own data centersin 2010and it's an expensive game to play. The company is expected to pour $7 to $7.5 billion into capital expenditures this year, up from $4.5 billion last year.The 11 Best Dividend Stocks to BuyBy pouring so much money into cloud centers, even launching its ownOpen Compute Project, which contributes code to the field's advancement, Facebook has freed itself from worrying about the cost of hosting. It's worried far more about the cost of not hosting. It's like an airline building a giant plane fleet - just sell, baby.So Facebook ispushing into bots, it's pushing into marketslike Africaand it's pushing into mobile video like no one else. It's creatingnew types of news feedsandscaling its adsto be the only real competitor toAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL).Along the way to growth it's running into trouble. Its users are having their accountssearched for fraud, it's accidentally hosting liverapesand it's beingthreatened with huge finesover fake news.But these problems, and the company'smodest spendingon solutions, are not the points FB stock investors should focus on - scale is the point.Bottom Line on Facebook StockVery few companies can afford to get into the cloud game.It takes enormous free cash flow to play, with $1 billion a quarter being just an ante into the pot.Alphabet gets it from search,MicrosoftCorporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) from software,Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) from devices.Amazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) gets it from its store.Meanwhile once-giant companies likeVerizon Communications Inc.(NYSE:VZ) andHewlett Packard Enterprise Co(NYSE:HPE) have been forced out.International Business Machines Corp.(NYSE:IBM) is hanging in by the skin of its teeth.United Continental Won't Pay for an All-Time PR Fail (UAL)Cloud is the future of computing. Cloud is the ""great game"" on the leading edge of technology. Owning cloud, having them funded, means you're going to be defining computing for the next generation. If you're not able to build clouds, you're not going to be playing that game. You're going to be dependent, on clouds as customers or on clouds as vendors.Facebook is independent, today and tomorrow. Even if FB traffic falls off a cliff, the company can quickly get into cloud hosting, or it can do other deals that fill its clouds with traffic. One theoretical example: Facebook could buyNetflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX). Its $62 billion market cap is highly affordable to a company worth $410 billion. You can argue they're complementary. And wouldn't Amazon, which presently hosts Netflix, be pissed?Because Facebook owns its own cloud, FB stock is in another league. Don't even think of comparing it to Snap. Facebook stock is a cloud play, and a very good one at that.Dana Blankenhornis a financial and technology journalist.

These are the 3 Biggest Threats Facing Advertising Stocks;4/10/2017;"With the amount of ads that consumers come across everyday, it is hard to believe that the ad industry is facing any obstacles. However, advertising giants like WPPWPPGY, Omnicom Group Inc.OMC, and The Interpublic Group of CompaniesIPGmay be facing some unseen risks.Here are the three biggest problems confronting advertising companies:Budget CutsNot from the agency itself, but the clients of ad agencies are cutting their budgets on advertising to remain profitable.WPP's stock tanked last Thursday when one of its top five clients, UnileverUL, said it plans to save €2 billion ($2.1 billion) in advertising before 2020, instead of the previous goal of €1 billion ($1.06 billion). The increase in savings is a defense strategy from Unilever against Kraft Heinz'sKHCmerger offer, and it results in the company having less money to pay to WPP.As the packaged-food industry sees a decline in sales with customers' shift in preference to fresh produce, consumer goods companies look to calm shareholders by showing that they can boost returns without outside help.Consumer goods accounted for 31% of WPP's sales last year, according to Macquarie GroupMIC. The British-based firm downgraded its growth forecast for 2017 from 3% to 2% last month. The decision might be prescient of Unilever's new strategy.President Trump""Advertising is cautious with Trump,"" said Michael Roth, IPG's Chief Executive, in a report byCNBC.While certain issues that Trump supports may align with some brands' mission, agencies still have to go through content to make sure that it doesn't offend anyone.Furthermore, global firms are sensitive to changes in the world economy, so as the President of United States, the leader of one of the world's largest economies, meets other world leaders and passes new policies ad agencies are affected with each event.Digital DisruptionWhile the immediate threats from clients' cost-saving and the global economy is impacting ad agencies, the threat of digital disruption is also hovering over them. With Alphabet's GoogleGOOGLand FacebookFBas the dominant platforms for advertising, the automated algorithm that's designed to allocate budgets for its clients efficiently seems more cost-efficient than traditional agencies.Though Google and Facebook also face obstacles like therecent ads placement controversy, advertisers, who previously pulled their ads out, have gone back to advertising on those platforms. The change of heart shows that companies have faith that these tech industry leaders will solve the problem.Bottom Line""All we're [the clients] really asking for is here's what we're paying for, validate that we're getting it, so we can then evaluate whether it's a good deal,"" said Marc S. Pritchard, Procter & Gamble's chief brand officer,in an interviewwith The New York Times. ""And if it's two seconds, and it costs X, and lifts the business, we'll do that.""Budget cuts could mean pulling an ad from Google or Facebook, not necessarily away from the ad agency. President Trump's actions have noticeable effects throughout the whole market. While it is unlikely that the traditional ad industry will be wiped out entirely by the tech companies, certain Silicon Valley darlings are infamous for disrupting businesses, especially within the media sector.Zacks' Hidden TradesWhile we share many recommendations and ideas with the public, certain moves are hidden from everyone but chosen members of our portfolio services.

Apple Inc. (AAPL) Is Poised to Kick 32-Bit Apps From App Store;4/10/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) hasn't held the title of biggest app store for three years. But despite being eclipsed byAlphabet Inc's(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Play for sheer number of apps and the total user base of iOS being a fraction of the size of Android, AAPL's App Store remains firmly in top for revenue generated. App developers love the App Store and so do iPhone and iPad owners.makeArticleAd();Source: AppleBut Apple appears poised to make a sweeping change, switching solely to 64-bit apps for iOS 11 and killing off thousands of older apps that haven't yet been updated. Will that move impact the App Store?AAPL and the Switch to 64-Bit64-bit CPUs are able to process data far faster than 32-bit versions, and they're able to take advantage of more RAM. There's a catch, though. 32-bit CPUs can't run code written specifically for 64-bit CPUs. And while 64-bit CPUscanrun software written for 32-bit processors, they have to use emulation and the user doesn't see the performance gain the more powerful CPU should offer.Apple was the first smartphone manufacturer to switch to 64-bit CPUs, with the iPhone 5S in 2013. Every iPhone and iPad released since then has been powered by a 64-bit version of AAPL's AX processors. However, we are now in 2017 and a significant number of apps in the App Store have not been updated to offer native 64-bit support.And it looks as though the clock is ticking. 9to5Macis reporting Apple is stepping up its campaign to crack down on older apps and willeliminate support for 32-bit apps in iOS 11this fall. At this point any of these apps would fall under theApp Store Improvementsprogram launched by AAPL in September, 2016. They would also stop working on iPhones and iPads that update to iOS 11.The 11 Best Dividend Stocks to BuyTrimming the App Store ClutterShortly after announcing that improvement program, AAPL began actively reviewing and removing apps that didn't comply. Last October alone, the companypulled nearly 50,000 apps.To put that in some perspective, it took about a year from its launch for the App Store to hit a grandtotal of 50,000 apps in 2009.Apple held the app store lead for several years before the momentum of Android caught up. In 2011, Android smartphones took the lead over Apple iPhones in the U.S. market, in 2013 Google Play took the lead in app downloads and in 2015 Google Play took the crown for sheer number of apps available.However, Apple has never been shy about aggressively policing its app store, because sheer numbers don't matter any more. Bragging rights for having the most apps were important in the early days, not so much now. Despite actions like pulling 50,000 apps in a single month, AAPL's App Store remains the most popular for premium apps andcontinues to dominate in terms of revenue- both for Apple and for developers.Who Loses When 32-bit Apps Get DumpedIf a 32-bit app is a paid app, the developer and any iPhone or iPad owner who bought that app will be on the losing end. The developer because their app will be removed from the App Store and the iPhone and iPad owners because once they update to iOS 11, if9to5Macis right, that app will no longer be usable.Warnings when launching 32-bit apps have been added by AAPL and are getting sterner. They first notified users that the older apps may slow their devices and in the latest developer version of iOS 10.3.1,9to5Macreports they state: ""This app will not work with future versions of iOS. The developer of this app needs to update it to improve its compatibility.""Apple Inc. (AAPL) Promises New Mac Pro in 2018, New Pro iMac in 2017Apple's own Clips app, which was just recently released,drops support for 32-bit processors. That means owners of popular iOS devices like the iPhone 5, iPhone 5c and iPad 4 can't use Clips, even though their device runs the latest iOS 10.3 operating system.The Writing's on the Wall for 32-Bit AppsAAPL will likely anger a few users who have favorite apps that haven't been - and won't be - updated for 64-bit support. And it's already beginning the process of shutting out legacy hardware users from accessing cool new apps. But Apple has never been shy about this sort of thing. Trimming the app fat has only made its App Store business stronger. Cutting off legacy hardware can lead to some owner frustration, but it makes the App Store stronger (developers don't have to support such a wide range of hardware) and helps to drive iPhone and iPad owners to upgrade to new models.Given the many hints, increasingly strong messaging and AAPL's pattern of operating, it seems likely iOS 11 will mark the death of 32-bit apps in Apple's iOS ecosystem.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceThe 10 Best Stocks to Buy for 2017: Still the Best?The New Apple Inc. iPad Strategy Is Sneakier Than You ThinkMicrosoft Corporation (MSFT) Will Sell You a Galaxy S8The postApple Inc.

3 Stocks We're Never Selling;4/10/2017;"Finding winning stocks is tough. That's why we Fools tend to   hold on tenaciously when we think we have bought a winner.So what stocks do we currently own that we plan on holding   forever? We asked that very question to a team of Fools, and they   pickedAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) ,Brookfield Property Partners(NYSE: BPY) , andMarketAxess Holdings(NASDAQ: MKTX) .Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();Google is growing up into a cross-sector conglomerateAnders Bylund(Alphabet): "" Never"" is a very long time, but I certainly don't have any   plans to sell my holdings in Alphabet for the foreseeable   future.The company is best known for its Google-branded range of   online tools and services today. Through Google, Alphabet   dominates the lucrative fields of online search and advertising.   YouTube is another market-defining property under the Google   umbrella. The Android platform for smartphones and tablets also   dominates its industry on a global level, again under Google's   aegis. It's safe to say that you know what the company does, and   you probably use its services every day. The Google segment   provided 99% of Alphabet's total revenue in the recently reportedfourth quarter.In short, AlphabetisGoogle. And with Google's sales rising 22% year over year,   driving operating income 17% higher, that's not a bad thing.But Alphabet won't look like that forever.The minuscule ""other bets"" segment is tiny and unprofitable   today but represents Alphabet's long-term future. The internet as   we know it may go away as quickly as it rose out of nowhere in   the 1990s, replaced by whatever comes next. (No, I can't tell you   what that might be. If I knew, I'd be getting rich developing   that idea rather than talking about the current state of affairs.   Sorry.)So Alphabet is getting ready for the day when online search   and marketing no longer supports a strong business foundation.   Other bets includeself-driving cars,advanced medical research, theGoogle Fiberhigh-speed internet service, and theNestline of smart thermostats. Beyond these familiar names, Alphabet   is working up many more not-so-obvious business ideas out of the   public eye.Any or all of these experiments may turn into profitable   businesses one day, and the Alphabet company was designed to   contain many long-term bets on the far future. Some of the   so-called moonshots contain an online element, but others don't.   In short, Alphabet is remaking itself as a whole new kind of   industry-spanning conglomerate.With or without the internet, Alphabet will be around for the   very long haul. The company is just getting started, using Google   to kindle the fires under a brand new bundle of growth   engines.A core real estate holdingMatt DiLallo(Brookfield Property Partners): I'm a firm believer that investors should hold some form of   real estate for the long term. The numbers back up this view, as   investors who added real estate or other alternatives to a   portfolio of stocks and bonds have significantly outperformed   those holding a more traditional portfolio over the long term.   While there are plenty of good ways to get into real estate, the   best, in my opinion, is by investing in Brookfield Property   Partners.The real estate partnership owns a core portfolio of office   properties in gateway cities around the world and a significant   stake in leading U.S. mall ownerGeneral Growth Properties(NYSE: GGP) . In addition, it has investments in several   opportunistic real estate funds that hold stakes in a variety of   other property classes, including multi-family, industrial, and   hospitality. That makes it a one-stop shop for real estate   investing.These real estate portfolios throw off very predictable cash   flow, 80% of which Brookfield Property Partners distributes back   to investors through a generous payout currently yielding 5.3%.   Meanwhile, the company reinvests the other 20% into redevelopment   projects to obtain higher rents. The upside from those   redevelopment projects, when combined with rent escalations and   development projects in the pipeline, provide Brookfield with the   ability to increase its payout by 5% to 8% annually over the long   term. That steadily growing payout, along with capital   appreciation across its portfolio, should drive 12% to 15% annual   returns for investors over the long term, which is why this is   one stock I'd never consider selling.This disruptor has a long runway aheadBrian Feroldi(MarketAxess Holdings): Did you know that the majority of fixed-income trading still   takes place over the phone or by email? Given the ubiquity of   electronic trading in the stock market, I was shocked to uncover   this fact.But now MarketAxess is attempting to bring the bond markets   into the 21st century. The company operates the biggest online   bond-trading platform in the world, making it easy for its users   to buy, sell, or research fixed-income securities. Not only   does this platform make far more sense than holding one-on-one   conversations to transact, but it also brings a whole new level   of transparency to this market.Being the top dog in this small but growing niche provides   MarketAxess with a big advantage. Just like every other   marketplace, bond buyers and sellers will naturally gravitate   toward the largest platform since it maximizes their chance of   getting a good price on either side of the transaction. This   network effect will make it nearly impossible for a potential   rival to catch up.One big financial benefit of running an electronic trading   platform is that it costs the company very little to add one more   user. That means the company's margins can consistently expand   over time, allowing profits to grow at a much faster rate than   revenue.MKTX Revenue (TTM)data byYChartsOver time, I'm convinced that the benefits of trading   electronically will persuade more and more market participants to   sign on the company's platform. Withplenty of market shareleft for MarketAxess' to capture, I think the company's torrid   revenue and profit growth rates should only continue from here.   That why I plan on holding on to my MarketAxess shares   indefinitely.10 stocks we like better than Alphabet (A   shares)When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Amazon and Google: Head to Head?;4/10/2017;"AmazonAMZNand Google are increasingly pitted against each other in all the markets in which they operate. But who will be the winner is a harder question to answer. As things stand now, the scales are evenly balanced, but who knows what the next decade will see?Competition for Ad DollarsLast week, a couple of analysts had things to say about Amazon's advertising business, which has been gaining momentum in recent months.BMO Capital's Daniel Salmon has said that the leading online retailer was stealthily creeping up on AlphabetGOOGL-owned Google and FacebookFBand would steal digital advertising dollars from the market leaders. He thinks Amazon's North America ""Other"" segment (attributed mostly to advertising) will grow 65% to $3.5 billion this year.eMarketer estimates that Amazon will generate more than a 1 billion dollars in U.S. ad revenue in 2017 compared to Google's $34 billion and Facebook's $15 billion. But more importantly, Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak estimates that this number will grow to $5 billion next year and $7 billion by 2020.It's apparent that Amazon is far from catching up with the leaders, but the thing to note here is that it has all that is required to have a very successful advertising business, so it may not be long before it is more than an experiment.At the moment, Amazon mostly shows targeted ads to people based on their browsing patterns and buying decisions, whether it's with respect to products or media. This therefore appears less intrusive and safeguards customer experience.Its store house of customer data is very attractive for advertisers but can be a serious privacy concern if shared with them. Amazon reportedly doesn't offer more than a broad description of a customer such as a ""tech geek"" or ""fashionista"" that advertisers can target, but it has the capability to offer more. For now, advertisers aren't complaining.Competition for Voice Controlled PlatformsAmazon has the lead in online retail, but that isn't the only lead it has. The company's Echo devices are going great guns and help it sell products and services. The artificial intelligence (AI) driven voice assistant Alexa has already been worked into a host of other everyday devices for the digital home and there are agreements to get it into even more. So Amazon is racing to build an ecosystem around Alexa and it's safe to say that it's taken an early lead.The opportunity is not lost on Google of course, which also has its Google Assistant powering Google Home that can personalize your experience probably more completely (when linked to your Google profile) and also help you search for pretty much everything under the sun.Selling ads on voice controlled devices isn't cool yet, but Google may have tried something that wasn't too well-received that it later said was a mistake. Since ads for the platform are yet to be figured out, Amazon has a better model at the moment, because it isn't just selling the device but through it, also products that customers need.Competition for Cloud Infrastructure ServicesHere again, Amazon has the lead with MicrosoftMSFTin hot pursuit. While some place Google in the third position, others say it is preceded by IBMIBM.According to Canalys, Cloud infrastructure services generated $10.3 billion in the fourth quarter, of which Amazon's AWS alone accounted for 33.8% while Microsoft, Google and IBM together accounted for 30.8%. The market is expected to grow 46% this year from $38.1 billion to $55.8 billion. So there's plenty of room for all the players to grow.Amazon seems to be expanding the fastest because of its first mover advantage, adding 11 new availability zones globally. Google added its first in Japan. Google's advantage is that it already has servers in major regions because of its ubiquitous search engine. So it can probably expand by building those out further. But it has a very long way to go to catch up with Amazon, and also Microsoft, which has its strong product range and enterprise customer base to fall back on.ConclusionGoogle is in for some very tough competition, which will likely unfold over the next five years or so. As things stand now, Amazon looks very strongly positioned to take in some nice profits, both from AWS and its advertising business that can help it offset effect of aggressive pricing in the retail business.Zacks' Hidden TradesWhile we share many recommendations and ideas with the public, certain moves are hidden from everyone but selected members of our portfolio services.

A Foolish Take: Which Company Is Leading in the Virtual Reality Race?;4/10/2017;"Many tech companies believe that virtual reality (VR) will be   the next major growth market. That's why big names likeFacebook's(NASDAQ: FB) Oculus, HTC,Sony(NYSE: SNE) ,Samsung, andAlphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google have all jumped into this   nascent space.Tech advisory firm Digi-Capital believes that the VR market   will grow from $2.7 billion in 2016 to $25 billion by 2021. The   top headsets in the market last year included Samsung's Gear VR,   Sony's PlayStation VR, Facebook's Oculus Rift, HTC's Vive, and   Google's Daydream. But the only headset to top a million   shipments was the Gear VR, which launched in late 2015, before   the other devices.Data source: SuperData Research. Chart created by the     author.makeArticleAd();That disparity is likely due to the fact that the $100 Gear   VR, which only works with Samsung's newer flagship devices, costs   much less than the other options. The $800 Vive and $600 Rift   both require high-end gaming PCs, which can run more than   $1,000.The PlayStation VR is a cheaper option at $400, but only works   with the PlayStation 4. Google's $80 Daydream, which arrived near   the end of 2016, is basically a Gear VR for non-Samsung Android   devices, but the list of compatible devices remains short.It's too early to declare a winner in the VR race, but the   market this year will likely look similar to 2016 -- cheaper   smartphone-based headsets will probably sell better than pricier   PC and console-based ones, as the latter two appeal more to   hardcore gamers than mainstream consumers.Offer from The Motley Fool: The 10 best stocks to buy nowMotley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more   than a decade beating the market.

Straight Path Communications Inc (STRP) Pops 150% on AT&T Inc. (T) Buy;4/10/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsStraight Path Communications Inc(NYSEMKT:STRP) - a small-cap company that collects assets including licenses for 5G spectrum, as well as intellectual property - is flying high on a buyout fromAT&T Inc.(NYSE:T). The telecom giant announced on Monday that it would buy out Straight Path for $1.25 billion in stock, sending STRP stock up roughly 150% in morning trade.makeArticleAd();The deal values Straight Path at $95.63 per share, which means at current prices of nearly $90 per share, shares haven't yet fully baked in the acquisition price.The acquisition isn't a total surprise - Straight Path, which was spun off ofIDT Corporation(NYSE:IDT) in 2013, said back in January that it had hired Evercore Partners to explore ""strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value.""

Will Uber Be the Hottest IPO of 2017?;4/10/2017;"By now, I think we all know what Uber is, what it does, and how it makes our lives easier. Have too many groceries? Get an Uber. Too drunk? Get an Uber. Stressful day at work? Uber. Like magic-now, it's really an expectation-any transportation woes vanish with the digital sight of a car heading your way.Launched only seven years ago,Uber Technologies Inc.is an app-based transportation company headquartered in San Francisco, California, and operates in about 270 cities and more than 60 countries worldwide. Using the app is easy: just type in your current location, where you want to go, and hit request Uber. From there, Uber uses its app to receive its ride requests, sending them out to drivers who transport customers to their final destination.Increased CompetitionThe emergence of on-demand rides has become a popular business venture all over the world, but it has proved difficult for companies to break away from the congested pack. At the end of 2015, Sidecar, another on-demand car service, officially stopped offering rides and deliveries.In addition to the now-defunct Sidecar, companies like Lyft, Curb, Southeast Asia-based Grab, India's Ola, and especially China's Didi Chuxing have all started to eat into the ride-hailing market share, becominghuge competitorsfor Uber. Didi is arguably Uber's biggest threat overseas, and the ride-sharing giant conceded defeat in August,selling its UberChina operationsto Didi and ending an expensive, bruising battle between the two companies.Even Alphabet Inc.GOOGLis becoming a threat to Uber, with plans to make its self-driving cars unit a stand-alone business. This initiative could put the company in direct competition with Uber, as the lack of a driver could keep costs down in the long-term. The company's Google division also recently began a pilot program with Waze, a company they acquired in 2013, that enables thousands of San Francisco commuters to join carpools; Waze also offers real-time driving directions based on information from other drivers.Self-Driving, Uber StyleBut Uber is right on Google's heels, and asself-driving car technologybecomes more commercially available, Uber has been constantly beefing up its business strategies focused on autonomous driving. Back in September, it began testing its self-driving FordFFusions in Pittsburgh; engineers rode in the driver's seat, ready to take over whenever things got tricky.Uber then introduced self-driving Volvo XC90s to San Francisco in December, and riders who requested an uberX were matched with one of these vehicles if one was available. Just days later, however, the California Department of Motor Vehicles revoked the registrations for its self-driving cars, as the company didn't have the proper permits.But Uber being Uber, the fleet of Volvos were on their way to Arizona within days. Uber already operates a self-driving car program in the state, and in 2015, partnered with the University of Arizona to research mapping technology.Uber also recently acquired a car start-up Otto, which specializes in self-driving trucks. Otto is a 90-person company, and its co-founder, Anthony Levandowski, will now lead Uber into the self-driving car market. Impressively, Otto engineers have worked at Tesla MotorsTSLA, AppleAAPL), and Google, and with this knowledge and expertise, Uber is bound to be a top player in the self-driving car industry.ControversyWhile Uber has seen great success, it's journey has been a bumpy one. The company has been in and out of the news thanks to a number of recent legal (Alphabet iscurrently suingthem for theft of its self-driving car technology) and reputation-hurting (note the company'ssexual harassment scandaland CEO Travis Kalanick's rude behavior towards a driver) headlines. And from noncompliance issues in New York City to regulatory concerns and lack of driver background checks, Uber has drawn scrutiny and criticism, and has even been banned in The Netherlands and in parts of Thailand, India, and China.It's no secret that traditional taxi services are not happy with the rise of Uber and other ride-hailing companies, and many argue that Uber should be subject to the same regulations that they face. In dozens of cities it has moved in to, Uber has faced intense opposition, lobbying, and legal challenges against it from these taxi companies.Uber has also been embroiled in along-standing battlewith its drivers. A group of drivers first sued the company back in 2013, claiming they should be classified as employees rather than independent contractors. As a result, Uber had been set to pay up to $100 million in reimbursement damages to almost 400,000 drivers, but recently, a federal judge in California ruled that the settlement was unfair.But as the saying goes, any publicity is good publicity, and all of the bad press has yet to really negatively affect Uber. Despitelosing over $1 billionin the first half of 2016, Uber gained just as much revenue in that same time period. Its ability to raise exorbitant amounts of money is incredibly impressive for a company who is less than a decade old, and this skill makes Uber that much more attractive to venture capital investors.IPO PotentialDespite these controversies, investors are eagerly awaiting an Uber IPO. Many have believed, or hoped, the company would go public for a few years now, but Mr. Kalanick wants ""to make sure [an IPO] happens as late as possible,"" said in an interview with CNBC last year.If and when Uber finally decides to go public, its potential would depend on the broader IPO market and economic environment. According to Renaissance Capital, IPOs only raised a paltry $18.9 billion in 2016, with annual proceeds falling to the lowest level since 2003. Just four companies filed public offerings that grossed over $1 billion.Looking ahead, it's difficult to pinpoint how busy the IPO market will be this year. Snap Inc.SNAP, the parent company of Snapchat, finally made that giant step last month, but it's hard to say what, and if any, other high-profile unicorns-i.e. Spotify, Pinterest, Airbnb, and yes, Uber-will follow. And recent high-growth IPOs like Twilio Inc.TWLOand NutanixNTNXhave traded strongly since their debut, a good sign for tech companies everywhere looking to make their trading debut.How Might Uber Perform?An IPO for Uber could be massive for both the company and Wall Street. It's currently valued at $68 billion after a total of nine rounds of funding worth $12.9 billion since its launch. And thanks to Uber's structure-a unique combination of transportation company, mobile Internet company, and real world engineering-the company has been touted as one of the best future IPOs.It's IPO, then, could go either way, but let one number stay in your mind: $68 billion. Let me write that again: $68 billion. This number is a hard one to forget, and a figure that will be on the forefront of many investors' minds come the time of its public offering, as it impressively showcases just how far this startup has come in a few short years.Now That Snapchat is Public, Which Tech Giant Could IPO   Next?You may be curious about the buzz surrounding Snap's IPO, but should you buy up this tech stock? In the2017 IPO Watch List, you'll get an inside look at Snap's exciting prospects and potential challenges.You'll also learn about 4 other exciting tech companies with jaw-dropping growth.

How to Trade Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock While It Corrects;4/10/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsNot much has changed forAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) off the price chart in the past couple of weeks. But if we're to believe price action is a leading indicator, the current narrative in GOOGL stock points more authoritatively at a corrective move in shares. Let me explain.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockIt's been two full weeks sincelast writing about GOOGL.Not much has happened, except investors trying to forgive and forget. And conditions may have quieted somewhat for Alphabet, but the GOOGL stock chart is now looking a bit more like an enemy of the state.At the time, Alphabet was and still is facing repercussions of marketing agencies and companies dropping YouTube and the Google Display Network advertising after learning content was placed alongside media showing terrorism and other acts of extremism.For its part, Alphabet was quick to begin taking action and improve its""brand safety controls.""But for some prominent foreign and U.S. based advertisers, improvements haven't happened quick enough and some key clients have pulled the plug on ad time.The latest step in fighting this pervasive problem is Alphabet will only allow ads on YouTube channels when the number of views hit a threshold level of 10,000. Theverdict is outwhether that will actually help advertisers and the new protocol does have its critics.In the interim and while the controversy plays out, if we're to watch how Alphabet shares have traded since our last analysis, it's looking more and more like a situation pointing to deeper corrective testing for GOOGL stock price.GOOGL Stock Daily ChartClick to EnlargeMy view of the technical situation has improved. In this context, however, it means I'm looking for a lower share price and larger correction to play out in the near term.On March 24, as annotated on the daily chart of GOOGL, I wrote of wanting to see a test of $795 to $825.The zone holds a couple retracement levels, the 200-day simple moving average and would allow for a second test of the prior highs within an established uptrend.Two days later, the upper band of support at $825 in GOOGL stock was tested. That's the good news. What's also occurred more recently is a bearish flag has developed against trendline resistance dating back to November.With GOOGL stock now back below the 50-day simple moving average, the expectation is for the price action to break below the bear flag into a deeper double-bottom style. This would challenge the low set on March 26 and more significant penetration of the support zone.GOOGL Targeted Long Put ButterflyConsidering my belief GOOGL's corrective move isn't finished, but not being overly bearish on the stock either, I like the long bearish-targeted April $830/$815/$800 put butterfly.If the position sounds familiar, it is. Other than slightly lower strikes and adjusting the target down by $5, it's the same strategy and virtually the same debit to enter as from our last analysis. The spread is valued at $2.15 with GOOGL stock near $840 and achieves its maximum profit of $12.85 if GOOGL falls by roughly 3.0% to $815 on expiration.More achievable, the limited risk spread maintains a profit range from $802.15 to $827.85. Prior to that third Friday, gains can also be realized outside this area under the right market conditions.Money management wasn't required of the other butterfly position as the spread value held up. But like last time, I do believe cutting risk with a stop of 50% or $1.05 to $1.10 is a good policy.Buy Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock When It Returns to RealityBottom line, the initial debit is small with this type spread, but continuing to hold during adverse conditions, a bullish reaction that nixes GOOGL stock's bearish flag makes sense and possibly less cents lost.Disclosure: Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in any of the securities or their derivatives mentioned in this article.

Twitter CEO Gives Up Compensation, Board Member to Quit;4/10/2017;"Twitter, Inc.'sTWTRregulatory filing on Friday showed that co-founder and present CEO Jack Dorsey has again forfeited direct compensation from the company.Dorsey followed the footsteps of Facebook, Inc.FBCEO Mark Zuckerberg and Alphabet Inc.GOOGLCEO Larry Page. Both of them took mere $1 as their salaries.However, there has been a reduction in the total compensation of Dorsey. Per the regulatory filing, his total compensation, excluding salary, bonus and stock and option awards, was $56,551 in 2016, considerably lower than $68,506 in 2015.Twitter, Inc. Price and ConsensusTwitter, Inc. Price and Consensus|Twitter, Inc. QuoteNotably, Anthony Noto, the current COO and CFO of the company received a compensation package of $23.8 million in 2016 compared with $401,281 in 2015. Noto's additional responsibilities as COO have earned him a hefty compensation this year. After Adam Bain's departure last year, Noto took on the additional role of the COO.In a separate development, Peter Fenton, a board member since 2009, will not be contesting in re-elections and will leave Twitter in May after the company's annual meet.We note that Twitter has underperformed the ZacksInternet Softwareindustry in the last one year. While the stock lost 13.4%, the industry witnessed a gain of 11%.Sluggish user growth, declining revenue growth rate, profitability issues, exodus of top level employees and the trolling menace have caused bloodbath on the trading front. Steep competition from the likes of Facebook, Snapchat and Instagram is also concerning. Also, Twitter's ad revenues are expected to decline from $1.36 billion in 2016 to $1.30 billion in 2017. The figure is expected to remain flat in 2018 and increase slightly to $1.31 billion in 2019. Twitter's mobile ad revenue market share is anticipated to decline from 2.6% in 2016 to 1.4% in 2019. In comparison, Snap's share will increase rapidly from 0.6% to 2.7% in the same period.Focus on live and user-friendly changes to the platform, though headed in the right direction, have not yet yielded the desired results.Twitter currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Key PicksA better-ranked stock in the broader technology space is Square, Inc.SQ, sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Stock Market News for April 10, 2017;4/10/2017;"Benchmarks declined only marginally on Friday, dragged down by weaker-than-expected March jobs data and President Trump's surprise attack against an airbase near Homs, Syria. The jobs data showed an increase of 98,000 jobs in March, marking the smallest gain in almost a year. Moreover, New York Fed President William Dudley's comments to avoid simultaneous rate hike along with Fed's plan to reduce its balance sheet, adversely affected the equity market.For a look at the issues currently facing the markets, make sure to read today'sAhead of Wall Street article.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) declined 6.85 points to close at 20,656.10. The S&P 500 fell 1.95 points or 0.1% to close at 2,355.54. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 5,877.81, declining 1.14 points. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) gained 3.9% to settle at 12.87. A total of around 3.05 billion shares were traded on Friday in NYSE. Decliners outpaced advancing stocks on the NYSE. For 45% stocks that advanced, 51% declined.Nonfarm Payroll DataInvestors digested the Labor Department report released on Friday which showed that the U.S. created 98,000 jobs in March, much lower than what was expected. Nonfarm payrolls grew by only 98,000 in March to mark the smallest gain since May last year. One of the reasons for this weak payroll growth number was weather-related effects of the big storm that hit the Northeast last month. After a huge gain in February, construction fell drastically, with gains of only 6,000 witnessed against the increase of 59,000 experienced in February. Retail sector saw a decrease of 30,000 jobs with employment in general merchandise stores falling by 35,000.On the positive side, unemployment rate declined from 4.7% to 4.5%, its lowest level in almost ten years. Payrolls data also showed that average hourly wages increased 0.2% to $26.14. The hourly pay rose 2.7% over the last twelve months ending March 2017. Additionally, the labor force participation rate for March held steady at 63.0%. The ""U-6"" is considered to be a broader measure of the unemployment as it includes those workers who are working part-time for purely economic reasons. U6 unemployment declined to 8.9%, due to the decrease in unemployment.While the actual unemployment figure was within the range of predictions, the number of jobs created missed economists' expectations by nearly 80,000. Moreover, the number of job additions for January and February were revised down a cumulative 38,000 with 216,000 jobs witnessed in January followed by another 219,000 in February. Consequently, weaker-than-expected March jobs data had a negative impact on investor confidence.Strike against SyriaThe U.S. carried out a cruise missile attack on Shayrat air base near Homs on Thursday night, in a possible attempt to target President Bashar al-Assad's regime which was held responsible for the chemical weapons attack in Syria last week.Shares of defense contractors rose. Some of defense sector's key holdings including L3 Technologies Inc.LLL, General Dynamics Corp.GDand Tomahawk cruise missile maker Raytheon CompanyRTNgained 1.8%, 1% and 1.5% respectively. You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The surprise intervention in Syria was carried out amid the tense meeting between Trump and Xi Jinping. Investors closely followed the summit given heightened expectations that the heads of the world's largest economies would find suitable solutions regarding trade and other issues.Dudley CommentsThe broader market also suffered some losses after William Dudley, president of the New York Fed, commented that Fed Reserve might avoid raising key interest rates at the time of unwinding $4.5 trillion bond portfolio from its balance sheet.Dudley's remarks helped U.S. Treasury yields to rise which again pushed dividend paying companies in back foot. The bond price declined which resulted in increase of treasury yield, ultimately pushing equities lower.Weekly LossFor the week, the Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow declined 0.6%, 0.3% and 0.03% respectively. During the week, the benchmarks suffered a setback after the release of minutes from the Federal Reserve. Weak auto sales data and a dip in manufacturing growth rate also had an adverse impact on the investor sentiments which eventually led the benchmarks to finish in the red.Stocks that made HeadlinesAlphabet's Google Charged with Gender-based Pay     DisparityAlphabet Inc.'sGOOGLdivision Google allegedly practices pay discrimination against its female workforce, according to The Guardian, which quoted the U.S. Department of Labor (DoL).

Facebook's (FB) Oculus Entangled in Yet Another Lawsuit;4/10/2017;"Facebook Inc'sFBvirtual reality (VR) division, Oculus has reportedly been dragged to court by a California-based technology firm, Techno View Inc. for ""infringing"" ImmersiON-VRelia's 3D imaging patent design. The design generates left and right perspectives in a 3D video game, per reports.ImmersiON-VRelia is a VR headset maker based in Redwood City. Techno View is litigating on its behalf, as reported by Reuters. The report further adds that Techno View ""may add claims relating to other patents owned ImmersiON-VRelia at a later date.""Earlier this year, Facebook was slapped with a $2 billion lawsuit filed against Oculus by video game company, ZeniMax. Per media reports, ZeniMax claims that Oculus ""stole"" its intellectual property to boost its own VR research. Though Facebook denied all allegations, it lost the lawsuit and was directed by the court to shell out $500 million in damages to ZeniMax.Oculus was founded by Palmer Luckey and Brendan Iribe in 2012 and acquired by Facebook in 2014. Facebook's ambitious AR/VR plans are being fueled by Oculus. A few days back, Zuckerberg said that Facebook was going to spend over $3 billion over the next 10 years.Facebook, Inc.

They'll enable us to experience completely new things and be more creative than ever before. Hugo is going to help build that future, and I'm looking forward to having him on our team.""Recently, per media reports, Luckey quit Oculus following a controversy during the U.S. presidential election in 2016.

Nokia Oyj (ADR) (NOK) Stock: A Decent Dividend, But Not Much More;4/10/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsNokia Oyj(ADR)(NYSE:NOK) has been showing some signs of life lately. For the year so far, the shares have logged a gain of nearly 11%. So s there more upside with NOK stock? Don't count on it.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockKeep in mind that - for the past year - NOK has been undergoing a massive transformation. The key part of this was the $17 billion merger with Alcatel-Lucent.According to theannual reportfrom Nokia:""We started the year primarily as a mobile networks and patent licensing company. Today we are a fundamentally different company, with a complete portfolio that spans mobile, fixed, cable, routing, optical, standalone software, services, digital health, and VR, as well as licensing activities covering patents, brand, technology, and more.""All this is backed up with40,000 employees in R&D(which involves the legendary Bell Labs), 31,000 patents and operations in more than 100 countries. What's more, there are expected to be about $1.27 billion in cost synergies by next year.So all in all, things should be very promising for NOK stock, right? Perhaps so. But it could take some time for the major changes to have a real impact. For example, the industries that NOK is targeting - like virtual reality and the Internet of Things (IoT) - are still in the early phases.But more importantly, there will likely be sluggishness in the core networking business. The main reason: Telecom operators seem to be in no hurry to transition to 5G systems. Let's face it, this move demands tremendous capital costs. As a result, the focus will be on trying to get as much as possible from the existing networks.NOK has already acknowledged this. Keep in mind that the guidance is for there to be a drop of about2% this year.Nokia Stock And the ChallengesNOK must contend with a tough competitive environment. Just some of the rivals includeMotorola Solutions Inc(NYSE:MSI),Mitel Networks Corp(NASDAQ:MITL) andTelefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson(NASDAQ:ERIC).Although, the low-cost Chinese operators may be the biggest threats, such asHuawei Technologies Co.Last year, the company saw its revenues jump by32% to $75.1 billionand the earnings came to $5.3 billion. NOK, on the other hand, posted revenues of $24.9 billion and suffered a net loss of $978 million.OK, so what about the Nokia 3310 phone? What might this mean for NOK stock? Actually, the retro strategy looks spot-on - and the demand for the phone appears to be considerable.Yet there are some notable drawbacks. Consider that the Nokia 3310 phone is only available on 2G networks, which limits the market potential. There is also no integration withFacebook Inc's(NASDAQ:FB) WhatsApp. This is important since many people in foreign markets must pay for SMS.Something else: NOK will only be getting licensing revenues, which may ultimately come to a couple bucks per phone. In other words, even if the it is a hit with customers, the financial impact may not necessarily be significant.Bottom Line on NOK StockIt's encouraging that Nokia is making bold moves. And this is not just about with the Alcatel-Lucent merger. NOK has also made some interesting acquisitions, such as in the telehealth space. Oh, and the Nokia 3310 shows that the company is pushing innovation.Buy Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock When It Returns to RealityBut again, all these are long-term initiatives. True, NOK stock is paying a hefty 3.5%, which is certainly at the high-end for the tech . Yet for investors, this may be the where much of the return will come from for the next few years, not necessarily from sustainable capital gains.Tom Taulli runs the InvestorPlace blogIPO Playbookas well asOptionExercise.com, which provides interactive tools & services for employee stock options of pre/post IPO companies.Follow him on Twitter at@ttaulli.

Google Is Using AI to Combat Internet Trolls;4/10/2017;"One of the biggest challenges facing websites, news   organizations, and social media is online abuse and harassment.   Since the dawn of the internet, sites have battled against   abusive, toxic, and inappropriate comments posted in their online   forums. With the millions of comments posted, news organization   quickly became overwhelmed by the magnitude of data produced.Websites and publishers have become so concerned by the volume   of vitriolic comments and fear of lawsuits that many have removed   the ability to post comments on their sites. Consider that 72% of   internet users in America have witnessed online harassment, and   nearly half have experienced it themselves. Social media sites   have been under fire to control hate speech and online abuse by   their members. Technological advancements in artificial   intelligence (AI) may finally provide the answer.Google uses AI to battle abusive content. Image source:     Pixabay.makeArticleAd();An important piece of the puzzleJigsaw, a technology incubator of Google parentAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) , has developed an artificial   neural network -- an AI system that replicates the structure and   learning capacity of the human brain using algorithms and   software models. Using this technology, it aims to identify and   control abusive online comments. Google and Jigsaw are making the   program available free of charge, and it's being added to the   Google's TensorFlow library and Cloud Machine Learning Platform.   The product, dubbed Perspective, uses deep learning to sift   through reams of data to detect harassment, insults, and abusive   speech in online forums in real time. Jigsaw explains how the   program works:Perspective scores comments based on the perceived impact a     comment might have on a conversation, which publishers can use     to give real-time feedback to commenters, help moderators sort     comments more effectively, or allow readers to more easily find     relevant information. We'll be releasing more machine learning     models later in the year, but our first model identifies     whether a comment could be perceived as ""toxic"" to a     discussion.Do you kiss your mother with that mouth?Google and Jigsaw used comment data fromThe New York Times Company(NYSE: NYT) , Wikipedia, and several unnamed partners. They then   showed that data to panels of people and had them rate whether   the comments were toxic. They used these human responses as   training data for the AI system, which will provide ratings of a   phrase based on its toxicity on a scale of 100 and allows you to   testthe   system. Type in the phrase ""you are ignoring important information""   rates a 10%, ""your mother wears combat boots"" garnered 55%, while   ""you're a jerk"" gets a response of 86% toxicity.The New York Times reports that it only has the resources to   allow comments on 10% of its articles. The company provided the   archives of comments in hopes of expanding its comments section   and to ""increase the speed at which comments are reviewed."" With   only 14 moderators to manually review every comment, the task   became overwhelming, reviewing on average 11,000 comments   daily.The New York Times joins Google to curb online abuse. Image     source: Pixabay.Twitter tries to clean up its actGoogle is not the only company seeking to curb online bullying   using AI. AtIBM's(NYSE: IBM) InterConnect conference last month,Twitter, Inc.'s(NYSE:TWTR) vice-president of data strategy Chris Moody announced that the   popular social network had partnered with IBM's Watson, the   AI-based cognitive computer, to address online abuse. He   stated:We're starting just now to partner with the Watson team.     Watson is really good at understanding nuances in language and     intention. What we want to do is be able to identify abuse     patterns early and stop this behavior before it starts.This comes at a crucial time for Twitter, which has been under   fire for not policing its users. The company announced last month   that it was working to make the site a safer place by limiting   abusive users' ability to create new accounts and updating how   users can report abusive tweets.That didn't end wellAI systems have been tested on social media before, though the   results have been less than stellar. In early 2016, the folks atMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) research had used Twitter as a testing ground for   an AI-based chatbot, @tayandyou, aka TayTweets, to learn the   speech patterns of millennials by interacting with them on the   site. Unfortunately, within 24 hours and 96,000 tweets, the   experiment was suspended when the fledgling AI began spewing   venomous vitriol. Microsoft later said:The AI chatbot Tay is a machine learning project, designed     for human engagement. As it learns, some of its responses are     inappropriate and indicative of the types of interactions some     people are having with it. We're making some adjustments to     Tay.Final thoughtsEach new technological innovation brings benefits and   challenges. The dawn of the internet age brought with it internet   trolls, who sought to control the conversation and silence   dissenting voices. Programs like Perspective and Watson seek to   return voices to those vulnerable speakers, which benefits us   all.10 stocks we like better than Alphabet (A       shares)When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock       tip, it can pay to listen.

How to Trade Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL) Stock Before Earnings;4/10/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe charts of airline stocks look almost like bank stocks. Airlines have enjoyed a massive rally into 2017 from ultra-low levels. But even at their highest recent highs, the carriers' valuations didn't look too bad. For instance,Delta Air Lines, Inc.(NYSE:DAL) doesn't exactly look like a screaming short when DAL stock is trading around 8 times trailing earnings.makeArticleAd();Source:via DeltaHowever, Delta earnings are coming up Wednesday before the bell, and I want to short the event. I'm not dissing the company's fundamentals - I just want to make a bet based on short-term price action.Fundamentally, the industry seems to have streamlined its operations, working on what appears to be good capacity levels. Just this morning, we learned of aUnited Continental Holdings Inc(NYSE:UAL) viral video where a flight was overbooked to the point that they literally had to drag a paying passenger off their plane.Of course, Delta itself is having some operational problems on the back of massive storms that hit the company's main hub in Atlanta. The airline has had to cancel several thousand flights since Wednesday, and the thought is that while much can be laid on the storms, DAL has flubbed parts of the recovery.The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for 2017: Still the Best?The opportunity I see here, however, is in the technicals of DAL stock. Prices are trying to hang on to $45 per share, but if it fails, sellers could be invited for a retest of $43.25.Click to EnlargeAs noted, I think airlines are operating lean and mean, so that gives us a floor against which we can sell downside risk to finance a near-term bearish bet. Or, in layman's terms, we can bet bearishly against Delta for free.How to Trade DAL StockThe Trade:Buy the April $45/$44 debit put spread for 35 cents per contract. This is the maximum amount we can lose. We need Delta stock to fall below our spread for a chance to more than double our money. I chose a near-the-money spread so we only need to guess direction - not thesizeof the move - to profit. (The options markets are pricing in a move of plus or minus $1.60 on earnings this week.)To mitigate our risk, we'll eliminate the out-of-pocket expense by selling bullish premium below proven support levels.Buy Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock When It Returns to RealityThe Bank:Sell the 26 May $40 put and collect 50 cents per contract. This is a bullish trade that has an 85% theoretical chance of expiring for maximum gains. As long as DAL stays above our sold strike, any premium we recover from the bought April put position would be profit.Selling naked options is risky, so only do this if you're willing and able to own DAL stock at that price. But again, Delta has a healthy P&L, so an entry point at a 10% discount from here sounds attractive to me.Learn options as easy as 1-2-3here.

Buy Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock When It Returns to Reality;4/10/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsLast week, Goldman Sachs started new analytical coverage ofAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMD) at a ""sell,"" suggesting the stock had rallied too far, too fast. Judging from the 6% tumble AMD stock took that day, the market didn't see it coming.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockSee, as far as traders were concerned, the 430% gain that Advanced Micro dished out over the prior 12 months implies that traders felt the development of theRyzencomputer processor and theVegagraphics processor were going to put the company back on a growth track. Goldman Sachs' thoughtscalled their whole logic into question.Does Goldman analyst Toshiya Hari have a point? He does. More than that, though, Hari serves up an important reminder that a stock and the underlying company aren't always necessarily one and the same.Yes, AMD Stock Is OvervaluedHari specifically feels Advanced Micro Devices isovervalued to the tune of 236%based on a plausible projection of sales over the course of the coming five years. He finds the stock's valuation is ""difficult to justify"" simply because it's ""priced to perfection,"" and then some.Once rivalsIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) andNvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA) turn it into a price war, the ugly reality of this overvalued name could take a real toll.That's why Hari believes AMD stock worth just $11 per share. That's more than 18% less than last week's closing price. And, with a forward-looking (2018) price-to-earnings ratio of 45.1, his stance sounds less and less crazy.The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for 2017: Still the Best?It all begs the question: How in the world did AMD shares get in this condition in the first place?The simplest answer is: human nature.But Advanced Micro DevicesIson TargetYes, you own a stock not for where the company is, but where the company is going to be six to 24 months down the road. It's not always easy to make a reasonable long-term guesstimate, but most traders do it well enough most of the time.There are times, however, when common sense seems to get thrown out the window and investors decide today's a good day to buy simply because there's no bad news today. There's been no (relative) bad news from or about AMD stock for months now - because the company has been in regroup mode - and traders remained in buy mode without ever stopping to realize they've been in perpetual buy mode since April of last year. Hari only pointed that out.It's not the first time investors have needed to be reminded a stock can't rise forever on a company's ""promising future."" Sooner or later, the future has to arrive and justify a frothy valuation. That future for Advanced Micro Devices is still a little too far off to keep the stock propped up at these levels.That being said, the stock/company relationship is still a two-way street. A falling stock doesn't necessarily mean the underlying company is doomed. It's simply a matter of aligning a stock's price and a company's potential. Several observers still feel good about AMD (the company).Barron's Tiernan Ray is one of those optimists.Ray recently wrote:""My colleague Teresa Rivas has anice summary of the Goldman argument, and Barron's positive view in contrast. The gist is that Hari is right about all the risks, which have always been there. But the stock is not priced expensively, as Hari implies, if one believes the company can take significant market share back from Intel (INTC) and possibly Nvidia (NVDA).In hours of conversation with CEO Lisa Su, CTO Mark Papermaster, and other executives, I did get a sense of a company with a more sober sense of purpose than in past days. I think the seriousness with which management recognizes both the opportunities and the risks is a meaningful factor. The company is aware that in past AMD fumbled leads it obtained. It is committed as an organization not to do so again.""All fair points.3 Stocks to Watch on Monday: Tesla Inc (TSLA), Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) and Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL)But, even Ray's commentary has a big ""if"" in it: If Advanced Micro Devices can steal market share back from INTC and NVDA. The consensus is, Nvidia and Intel are ready to go to war.Bottom LineI'll repeat something I said back on March 10:""Don't confuse any future weakness from AMD as evidence of what's in store, results-wise, from the company. Advanced Micro Devices is very well positioned for a great 2017. The trick is just being patient enough to wait for a truly palatable entry price. That could still be well below the recent low.In other words, you don't want to step into AMD stock for the long haul until it's almost uncomfortable to do so. We aren't there yet.""We still aren't there yet. I'm not even sure a retreat to Hari's target of $11 would get us all the way there. It's still a compelling company though.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceFitbit Inc (FIT) Stock Hurts, But Here's Why I'm Still a BelieverTrade of the Day: Citigroup (NYSE:C)7 Utility Stocks That Will Crack Your Nest EggThe postBuy Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT) Stock Should Have You Salivating;4/10/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsShares ofWal-Mart Stores Inc(NYSE:WMT) on Friday, April 7, rose a little more than 2% on the day. More importantly, WMT stock scored a marginal technical breakout in the short-term.makeArticleAd();While many market participants remain skeptical of Walmart's ability to break higher from here, the charts have been more constructive than they have for alongtime.When I hold my twice-weekly calls with my inner circle of hedge funds and institutional investors, the topic of WMT stock versusAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) comes up at least half of the time. The posturing of many of these investors remains clearly in favor of AMZN stock given the behemoth's amazing track record of taking over the lead in many areas of retail and beyond.While I certainly believe in Amazon's ability to continue to innovate and grow, and while I believe in Amazon shares long-term, Walmart is doing a few good things of its own. It's not only improving its physical stores, but meaningfully expanding its online platform.When I last discussed WMT shares on Feb. 27, I said the stockcould be a pleasant surprise for 2017. Specifically, I near-term pointed to the $72.50 level and said if and when it could be overcome on a daily closing basis, a next upside target in the mid-$70s would open up, followed by the high $70s or low $80s as next possible upside targets. Until last Friday, Walmart hadn't been able to overcome $72.50 on a daily basis.The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for 2017: Still the Best?Now, it's time to update this trade idea.WMT Stock ChartsOn the multiyear weekly chart, we see that ever since breaking below its red 200-week simple moving average in the summer of 2015, Walmart has respected it as technical resistance.Click to EnlargeNote that this area around the $72-$73 levels also allows us to draw a simple line of horizontal resistance. If and when this area can be overcome on a weekly closing basis, it may turn into technical support.On the daily chart, we see that the corrective phase Walmart had been in from August 2016 into January of this year has carved out a bullish pattern that could be looked at in several ways.Click to EnlargeOne way is to look at the price action as a big bullish flag formation that, with a breakout above $70 in February, has already given us bullish confirmation of a move higher. Another way is to note the inverse head-and-shoulders pattern marked by the three blue triangles, which also points to a move into the high $70s or low $80s over time.3 Stocks to Watch on Monday: Tesla Inc (TSLA), Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) and Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL)Last Friday WMT stock broke past horizontal resistance around $72.50 that had been firmly in place since September 2016 and thus may have ignited a move into the mid to high $70s for now.Any bearish reversal that sees WMT st0ck close back below $71 would be a stop-loss signal for any swing trades long.Like what you see?

That includes dramatic quarterly changes, such as the upcoming Q1 estimate, which is being hacked from a 12-cent loss to 78 cents of red ink.The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for 2017: Still the Best?Potter also predicts an 11-cent loss for full-year 2018; he previously did not have any earnings estimates on the stock.Despite this change in heart, however, Potter also advised clients to ""employ a 'creative' valuation methodology and prepare for a bumpy ride,"" and proceeded to upgrade TSLA shares from ""Neutral"" to ""Overweight."" He also jacked up the price target from $223 to $368 - a roughly 22% increase from Friday's closing price of $302.54.TSLA shares are currently up roughly 2% in Monday's premarket trade, pushing shares even further into the stratosphere. The stock finally pushed up and out of a multiyear trading range last week, and is setting a new string of highs that appears will continue today.UPDATE:With Monday's push, Tesla passedGeneral Motors Company(NYSE:GM) as the largest U.S. automaker by market capitalization.

However, while the storms did cause some damage, the company also is being criticized for its own slow response, as well as internal regulations that may have exacerbated the problem.Sunday marked the fifth day of troubles for the carrier, which had to cancel at least 150 flights yesterday, but the company continues to be held up by rules including how long pilots and flight attendants can staff planes.Naturally, passenger stories are bubbling up - from tales of flights being cancelled, then rebookings cancelled, to even a tale about how one woman's familybrought in $11,000by continuously giving up their tickets to Delta to service standby passengers.Still, DAL stock is primed to open Monday's trading up more than 2%.More From InvestorPlace10 Under-the-Radar Stocks to Buy Now for Explosive UpsideThe 10 Best ETFs to Buy for the Rest of 2017The 10 Cheapest Vanguard Funds on the MarketThe post3 Stocks to Watch on Monday: Tesla Inc (TSLA), Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) and Delta Air Lines, Inc.

Per a Mar 2016 Glassdoor study report, women earn about 76 cents per dollar men earn.Is Google in Trouble?The charges are shocking for a brand that apparently has always been at the forefront against any gender-based disparity.

Holy IMAX, Batman: Movie Companies Plan to Create VR Superheroes!;4/10/2017;"Imagine going to a movie theater and experiencing the undersea   world of Aquaman or visiting Superman's Fortress of Solitude.   This may sound fanciful, but these types of virtual reality (VR)   experiences may soon become actual reality thanks to a new   partnership betweenTime Warner Inc.'s(NYSE: TWX) Warner Bros. Home Entertainment andIMAX Corporation(NYSE: IMAX) . The companies have announced a co-financing   and production agreement to create original interactive VR   content forAquamanandJustice League, as well as a third unnamed project.IMAX and Warner Bros. will create supersized VR experiences.     Image source: IMAX.makeArticleAd();Bringing superheroes to lifeRecent developments, particularly in the area of special   effects, have resulted in characters coming to life on the screen   like never before. This has given rise to a renaissance in comic   book movies that have delighted fans and created a worldwide   box-office phenomenon. This partnership creates exciting new   opportunities in VR.""A key component of our vision for VR is to help usher in the   first wave of high-end blockbuster-based content.Justice LeagueandAquamanfeature some of the most beloved characters on the planet,   providing iconic properties to launch this effort,"" said IMAX CEO   Rich Gelfond. ""This type of premium content will introduce   audiences to virtual reality in stand-alone and multiplex-based   IMAX VR centres as well as other platforms.Warner Bros. hopes to leverage the box office success of its   movies likeMan of Steel,Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, andSuicide Squadfor its upcoming creations while offering fans additional ways to   interact with their heroes.""Using content and characters from these upcoming films and   incorporating creative direction from some of Hollywood's most   innovative filmmakers will help us to bring a groundbreaking   experience to audiences and consumers who are hungry for a   cutting-edge virtual reality experience,"" said Warner Bros. Home   Entertainment President Ron Sanders. Each super-sized   experience will be available during an exclusive window at IMAX   VR centers, later expanding to other VR platforms. Details   regarding the exact nature of the content have not yet been   revealed.A communal experienceThis announcement tops off a busy few months for IMAX in the   area of VR. Though the company is best known for its premium   large-format theaters, IMAX recently opened a pilot VR center in   Los Angeles, andearly reviewshave been encouraging. It has plans to open five more locations   by the end of the year.These VR centers will employ IMAX's proprietary modular design   that will allow multiple players to interact and enjoy a communal   experience, envisioning it as a destination for groups of   friends. If the testing at these initial locations proves   successful, IMAX plans to expand the concept globally to   multiplexes, shopping centers, and select tourist   destinations.IMAX plans to revolutionize the virtual reality experience.     Image source: Getty Images.Google partners on techIMAXrecently partneredwithAlphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) Google to develop a   high-resolution cinema-grade VR camera using Google's Jump   platform, which can stitch together 360-degree images into   seamless content. The combination will address the technological   challenges unique to VR.Google recentlymade wavesof its own in VR, receiving an Oscar nomination for its short   filmPearl, a movie that was specifically created to be viewed in virtual   reality. The story revolves around a father and daughter who   travel the country chasing stardom as witnessed from the front   seat of their car. Google Spotlight Stories has been creating   animated shorts for several years to experiment with the   challenges created by 360-degree storytelling.VR for the massesVirtual reality is in its infancy and systems can still run   into the thousands of dollars. Reaching an untapped market of   consumers that may be interested in the technology, but unwilling   to make such a large expenditure on their own, may represent a   huge payoff for the companies.Virtual reality and its sibling augmented reality are still   nascent technologies, but represent huge potential. IDCestimatesthat revenue from these markets could exceed $143 billion   annually by 2020. These are early days for both IMAX and Warner   Bros. in the area of VR, but by providing location-based options   tied directly to fan favorite blockbuster movies, this could   generate a new stream of revenue, and it looks like a smart way   to get a foothold in an emerging field.10 stocks we like better than IMAXWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Amazon's growth is fueled by increasing Prime membership,   which acts as a huge incentive for both customers and merchants   to use Amazon's marketplace before looking elsewhere. A survey   fromBloomReachfound that 55% of online shoppers begin their product search on   Amazon.com.But what's really driving Amazon's stock price higher is its   more profitable operating segment, Amazon Web Services. AWS is   Amazon's cloud computing service, which supports all sorts of web   applications, from basic websites to huge data-consuming apps   such asNetflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) . AWS sales increased 55% last year to $12.2   billion. More importantly, the segment's operating profit of $3.1   billion is about three times as much as Amazon's retail   business.Amazon is also expanding into other high-margin businesses.Its advertising business is growing rapidly, albeit on a small base.Morgan Stanleyanalyst Brian Nowack estimates that Amazon's ad business could   grow to $5 billion by next year and $7 billion by 2020. And those   sales are high margin, which means that despite the relatively   small revenue compared with the rest of Amazon's retail segment,   Amazon could see significant profit growth. Nowack notes,   however, that Amazon's ad revenue growth shouldn't cut into   Google's core search ad sales.Alphabet is as steady as everAlphabet may have changed its name to reflect its other bets   besides Google, but the online advertising business is still its   core business. Google accounted for 99% of the company's revenue   and 118% of its operating income in 2016, while ""other bets""   produced an operating loss.Image source: GoogleGoogle is managing to expand its already dominant share of the   search advertising market. eMarketer expects Google to expand its   share by 16.1% to claim roughly 78% of the U.S. search market   this year.Google growth is being fueled by its Android operating system,   which recently became the most popular operating system across   all devices. Google is also extremely popular across other mobile   OSes, and consumers are turning to their smartphones more often   to look up details on just about anything. That means more Google   searches and more search ad revenue.YouTube is also a dominant force on mobile, with the average   mobile viewer spending 40 minutes watching video per session as   of mid-2015. YouTube is currently under scrutiny for displaying   ads before objectionable content, but Google has quickly taken   steps to counteract the issues. The negative impact on Google   should be relatively small.Lots of growth, but which should you buy?The growth outlook for both Amazon and Alphabet is quite   strong, so how can investors decide which to buy?Both companies have strong balance sheets with huge amounts of   cash and relatively little debt. Alphabet's $86 billion in cash   and equivalents, however, completely dwarfs Amazon's $26 billion.   Alphabet even has less long-term debt than Amazon. Alphabet also   produces more cash from operations -- $36 billion, versus $16   billion. That's not to say Amazon's struggling for cash, but   Alphabet is in a better position.Perhaps more telling are the valuation multiples investors are   putting on both companies. Amazon currently trades for a   price-to-earnings multiple of 182.6. Alphabet (C shares) is   comparatively cheap at 29.6 times earnings.But analysts are significantly more bullish on Amazon's   earnings growth prospects, expecting an average of 72.7% earnings   growth over the next five years, compared with just 19% for   Alphabet.Google's growth is coming from the megatrend of advertisers   who are shifting more ad dollars to digital while consumers spend   more time searching and watching videos on their smartphones.   Amazon's growth will come from AWS and the emergence of other   high-margin categories such as advertising. Amazon is also   working off a much smaller net-income base than Alphabet. Its   growth is much less certain than Alphabet's, but it has the   potential to pay off in the long run.If you can stomachthe up-and-down nature of Amazon stock, I think it makes a better long-term buy despite its sky-high   valuation. For more conservative growth investors, Alphabet is an   excellent option.10 stocks we like better than AmazonWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

2 Stocks You Can Buy and Hold Forever;4/9/2017;"Some might say I'm taking on way too much risk. Others might   say I've just gotten lucky. Both could be right.Here's the undeniable fact: When I combine my holdings ofAmazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) andAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) , they account for 35% of my   family's stock holdings. So, when I tell you I think you can buy   and hold these two companies forever, my money is firmly where my   mouth is.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();It's worth pointing out that I never intended for things to be   this way. Both Amazon and Alphabet -- better known as Google --   have grown significantly into their current positions. I just   have no intention of selling. That's because both satisfy the   four most important things I look for in an investment.A wide moatOver time, I've learned the hard way that the strength of a   moat -- or asustainablecompetitive advantage -- is the most important factor in   determining whether to invest in a company. Put the simplest way,   a moat is what differentiates one company from the next -- and   keeps the competition at bay.Alphabet's moat is provided by the dominance of Google's   search engine. Netmarketshare.com estimates that Google has a 77%   market share of desktop searches, and 96% of mobile searches.   That allows the company to collect gobs of data to help   advertisers hit specific potential customers, something   advertisers are more than willing to pay up for.But it doesn't stop at search. Alphabet now has six other   products with over 1billionusers: Google Maps, Gmail, Chrome, Android, Google Play Store,   and YouTube. That's a powerful ecosystem.Amazon, on the other hand, benefits from both physical   advantages of scale and -- increasingly -- the network effect. On   scale, the company has spentbillionsbuilding out its network of mammoth fulfillment centers. These   centers -- there are an estimated 95 stateside, with 26 more   on the way -- help ensure that everything you order on Amazon   gets to your front door as soon as possible. It would be   prohibitively expensive foranycompany to try and match this scale.On the other hand, Amazon's third-party selling option has   gained a lot of attention lately. Sales from retail third-party   seller services doubled in the last two years alone, to   $23 billion. What this means is that more non-Amazon   retailers are using Amazon's platform to sell products. That   incentivizes more buyers to use Amazon -- and based on estimates   of Amazon Prime customers counts, they are doing so in droves.   It's a virtuous cycle that continues to build steam.Optionality in spadesHere's how optionality works in the real world: You do   hundreds of experiments, tinkering with what will work. Most of   your efforts will fail, but your losses will be small. Every now   and again, you'll happen upon a big hit, and it will provide a   meaningful source of future income. You have theoptionof killing off or further pursuing your experiments.Amazon is the King of Optionality. It started as an online   bookstore but has branched into e-readers, retail, cloud   services, original content, and even delivery services. No quote   better sums up CEO Jeff Bezos' attitude toward optionality than   this, when addressing the failure of the company's Fire   Phone:You need to be making big, noticeable failures. The great     thing is that, when you take this approach, a small number of     winners pay for dozens, hundreds of failures.Alphabet's decision to rename itself to differentiate the   company's ""Other Bets"" is just another way of saying that it,   too, is focused on optionality. The company is variously focusing   on a connected house through Nest, self-driving cars, and faster   Internet via Google Fiber. And there's no telling what might come   out of Google[x] in the coming years.Skin in the gameAuthor, trader, and academic Nassim Taleb has written often   about how important it is that decision-makers have their own   skin in the game. Without it, those who rely on such   decision-makers have no recourse against the hidden risks   inherent in any complex organization.That's why I find it heartening that both Amazon and Alphabet   are founder-led companies, with both founders having a   significant portion of their skin in the game.CompanyFounderShares OwnedValueVoting RightsAmazonJeff Bezos83 millionabout $74 billion17.6%AlphabetLarry Page21 millionabout $18 billion26.6%AlphabetSergey Brin20 millionabout $17 billion25.9%Data sources: Most recent company DEF 14A filings.The people running these companies have even more incentive   than you and I do to see long-term success take hold.Financial fortitudeFinally, I think it's important that any business I invest in   have financial resources on hand to weather an economic downturn.   In both Amazon and Alphabet, I believe we have those things.CompanyCashDebtFree Cash FlowAmazon$26 billion$7 billion$10 billionAlphabet$92 billion$4 billion$26 billionData source: Yahoo! Finance. All figures for the 2016 fiscal   year, rounded to the nearest billion.When you combine these four factors: a wide moat, optionality,   skin in the game, and financial fortitude, I believe you have the   ingredients for a winner. That's why these companies comprise   such an enormous part of my portfolio, and it's why I think you   can buy and hold these stocks forever.10 stocks we like better than AmazonWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

3 Top Dividend Stocks in the Server Industry;4/8/2017;"Servers are, in many respects, the backbones of technology   industry. They serve as critical infrastructure on which a host   of other functions rest. Considering their importance, it should   come as no surprise that the server market is one of the largest   sub-industries in all of tech; global server sales totaled $14.6   billion in Q4 2016, according to research firmIDC.Cloud computing is undoubtedly changing the industry, but the   leading server manufacturers remain several well-known tech   companies. In this article, we'll look at three dividend-paying,   large-cap stocks that investors interested in the server market   should consider.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();Hewlett-Packard EnterpriseIt is the world's largest server provider, and servers sales   constitute the single-largest revenue contributor amongHewlett-Packard Enterprises'(NYSE: HPE) six reporting sub-sections, accounting for $14.0   billion of the IT giant's $50.1 billion FY 2016 sales. Like   the rest of the market, Hewlett-Packard Enterprise's server sales   have remained fairly static, declining just 0.7% from 2015 to   2016.For those unfamiliar with it, the company was formed from the   2015 split of the iconic tech conglomerate Hewlett-Packard.HP Inc. was created to house the PC and printer division, which remain   in secular decline, while Hewlett-Packard Enterprise was created   to hold the more promising businesses. However, looking at   current analyst estimates, it isn't immediately clear that those   businesses are, in fact, more promising.Wall Street analysts see the company's 2017 estimated sales   falling 28% and its FY 2018 revenue declining a further   17%. Interestingly, this kind of sales attrition did not   reveal itself in HPE's most recent 10-K filing; FY 2016 total   revenues fell a mere 3.8%. As such, investors considering   buying HPE for its income-producing abilities should keep in mind   that many observers widely expect its business to gradually   deteriorate in the coming years. Buyer beware.In terms of its dividend stats, HPE yields slightly less than   the market average of 1.94%. The company raised its dividend in   December, so its shares yield 1.28% on a trailing-12-month rate   basis, and 1.48% on a forward basis. It also enjoys plenty of   room for future rate increases -- HPE's payout ratio sits at just   12.6% -- though its revenue growth outlook profile remains a   critical consideration for anyone looking at HPE stock.International Business MachinesUnlike HPE, the dynamics atInternational Business Machines'(NYSE: IBM) server business better reflect the on-the-ground   reality of the server industry. IBM organizes its sales of its   three main server products under the umbrella of its Systems   reporting segment. For its fiscal 2016, sales of IBM's physical   servers plummeted 21.8% to $5.9 billion. This might seem dire,   but it's important to remember that cloud computing and IBM's   various software-as-a-service offerings still rely on servers to   power their systems. In fact, IBM's cloud revenues grew 49% in   2016 to a run rate of $5.8 billion, or roughly the same size as   IBM's current server sales base. Said another way, IBM's shifting   business model hasn't eroded the server as a key driver of its   sales. Rather, the rise of cloud computing means IBM is selling   server-powered software to customers, rather than physical   servers themselves.In terms of its dividend payments, IBM shares currently yield   3.2%, well above market averages. The company has done an   admirable of job steadily increasing its payouts as well. Though   not a Dividend Aristocrat, IBM has increased its annual cash   payments for 17 consecutive years. It also bears noting that IBM   has been one of the most active companies in corporate America in   terms of rewarding its shareholders through stock buybacks as   well. So, while IBM doesn't command the same kind of server   market share as HPE, the company's continued progress in its   ongoing business pivot and above-average yield make it one of the   more appealing income-producing stocks to appear on this   list.IntelAnother interesting dividend play tied to the server industry   could be investing in one of the suppliers that provides hardware   components to the industry at large. If that's your flavor, then   chip giantIntel(NASDAQ: INTC) is perhaps your best bet.Intel is widely acknowledged to control an estimated 99% of   the server microprocessor market, making it a proxy for the   industry as a whole. As such, companies that make and sell   physical servers to customers, like HPQ and IBM, use Intel chips   to power their products. However, major cloud computing providers   -- likeAmazon,Alphabet, and others -- also use Intel server chips to power their   respective cloud infrastructures. As such, investing in Intel can   be seen as a nice way to invest in the industry growth as a   whole, while saving the headache of having to determine which   specific server manufacturer will perform the best.Seasoned tech investors will also recognize Intel as one of   the industry's best-knowndividend   stocks. Though fairly mature from a sales growth perspective, Intel   handsomely rewards its shareholders through cash distributions   and stock buybacks. Intel's current dividend yield sits at a   respectable 2.9%. Its 49% payout ratio should give the   company the flexibility to continue to raise payouts in the   future as well. And while not a Dividend Aristocrat -- Intel   missed raising its dividend as recently as two years ago -- the   company has demonstrated a general commitment to growing its   dividend. As just one example, Intel's cash distributions grew   from just $0.07 in its FY 2000 to $1.04 in its FY 2016. So, while   Intel doesn't directly produce servers, its shares can still be   an interesting way for investors to generate dividend payments   from the server industry all the same.10 stocks we like better than IntelWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Alphabet Inc. Earnings: 3 Metrics to Watch;4/7/2017;"Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) has put its first-quarter earnings   release date on the calendar. The internet search giant will   report results for its most recently ended quarter on Thursday,   April 27. After missing estimates for earnings per share in its   most recent quarter, investors will be watching the company's   profitability closely.Here's a preview of what to expect from Alphabet's EPS in Q1,   as well as a look at two other key metrics worth examining when   Google's parent company reports results later this month.Image source: Google.makeArticleAd();Earnings per shareFor Alphabet's first quarter of 2017, analysts are expecting   non-GAAP EPS of $7.39, on average. Notably, analyst estimates are   no longer based on an EPS calculation that excludes stock-based   compensation, as Alphabet has opted to beginincluding stock-based compensation in its   non-GAAP results. So, Alphabet's year-ago EPS figures don't represent an   apples-to-apples comparison. But, for reference, Alphabet   reported GAAP and non-GAAP EPS of $6.47 and $7.50 in the first   quarter of 2016.The reasoning behind Alphabet's decision to include   stock-based compensation in its non-GAAP EPS? Stock-based   compensation has become a material and regular cost to running   Alphabet, CFO Ruth Porat explained in the company's   fourth-quarter earnings call.Revenue growthAnother key item to watch in Alphabet's first quarter will be   revenue growth. On average, analysts expect Alphabet to report   revenue of $24.21 billion, up a nice 19.5% year over year.Analysts are interestingly expecting a slight deceleration in   the company's year-over-year revenue growth rate. In Alphabet's   fourth quarter of 2016, revenue jumped 22% year over year, or 24%   on a constant currency basis.Beyond checking in on Alphabet's revenue growth, investors may   want to look for some insight from management into what the main   drivers for revenue growth during the quarter were. In Q4,   Alphabet's revenue growth was primarily driven by mobile search   and YouTube. Did these drivers remain key catalysts in Q4?Other revenueNot to be confused with Alphabet's ""other bets"" segment,   Alphabet's ""other revenue,"" is another important segment to   watch. Accounting for over 10% of Alphabet's revenue, the segment   has been growing rapidly, thanks to revenue from the Google Play   store, hardware sales, and the company's cloud businesses.Google Home. Image source: Google.In 2016, Alphabet's other revenue grew 41% on a full year   basis. And in Alphabet's fourth quarter, other revenue increased   62% year over year.In Alphabet's fourth-quarter earnings call, Porat said the   company sees ""tremendous potential"" in Play, hardware, and   cloud.A specific area of Alphabet's other revenue for investors to   look for more details on is hardware. Having just launched its   voice-activated smart speaker (Google Home) and a new smartphone   (Google Pixel) in Q4, Alphabet had some insight into these   products' potential. Fortunately, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said   during Alphabet's fourth-quarter call that the early success of   these products was ""promising.""Alphabet reports its first-quarter results after market close   on Thursday, April 27.

One big   plus for the firm is that it has a deal to make 100 million A11   microchips to be used in the upcoming Apple iPhone 8 this   year.Tencent, China's most valuable company, is up 46%. The company   owns China's largest social network, WeChat. Last week, Tencent   disclosed that it had bought a 5% stake in electric-vehicle makerTesla(TSLA). The investment comes as Tesla chief Elon Musk is under   pressure to deliver his $35,000 Model 3 sedan on time later this   year and at a pace he forecast. Musk described Tencent as an   advisor, hinting that the new relationship may be strategic, not   just financial.China Construction Bank's Hong Kong-listed shares rose 40% in   the year. Chinese banks have soared in the past year. Many   investors expect China's modest monetary tightening to help   boost profits. And many investors see the banks as attractively   valued. Yet other investors remain concerned about   banks' bad debt levels and a perception that state-owned   lenders put national strategic interests above those of   shareholders.InflowOnly one of the 10 stock mutual funds with the largest net   inflows in the 12 months ended Feb. 28 is not an index fund.   That's the $106.7 billion American Funds American Balanced Fund   (ABALX), whose $9 billion of inflow ranked No. 7 among stock   funds, according to Morningstar.American Balanced is a stocks-plus-bonds fund that aims for   stocks to account for 50% to 70% of its portfolio.A similar pattern exists among bond funds, whose biggest   drawers of net inflow are also index funds.Increasingly, many investors have decided that it istoo hard for mutual funds to consistently beat   market benchmarks, Tom Roseen, head of research services for Lipper, recently told   IBD. Index funds enable shareholders to come close in   performance. The lower an index fund's costs, the smaller the gap   between the fund's performance and the index it tracks. ""Active   managers have to outperform their index and their expense ratios,   putting a bigger hurdle in front of them to jump,"" Roseen   said.Vanguard, with its reputation for low-cost index funds,   dominated the ranks of mutual funds pulling in the biggest net   inflow. Eight of the biggest-inflow stock mutual funds were   Vanguard's. Six of the top inflow bond funds were Vanguard's.Inflow to index funds and outflow from actively managed funds   were the key to giant asset managerBlackRock's recent decisionto merge a number of its actively managed funds into robo-funds,   computer-driven portfolios. In addition, some actively runBlackRock(BLK) funds will be closed or given new investment mandates. At   least five fund managers will be shown the door.BlackRock's iShares arm attracted nearly $108 billion in net   new money to its low-cost ETFs in calendar 2016.   But BlackRock itself bled a net $8.414 billion, basically,   from its mutual funds.RELATED:Guess Which Stock Mutual Funds Drew The Most     Money In '16Vanguard Drew The Lion's Share Of 2016's Mutual     Fund Net InflowVanguard Net Fund Inflow Dwarfed Its Peers' In     2016"

Zacks Earnings Trends Highlights: Apple, Alphabet, Facebook and Micron;4/7/2017;"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL - April 07, 2017 - Zacks Director of Research Sheraz Mian says, ""We have Q1 results from 23 S&P 500 members already (fiscal quarters ending in February). Total earnings for these 23 index members are up +14.5% and their revenues are up +5.1% from the comparable period last year.""Q1 Earnings Season Gets UnderwayNote: The following is an excerpt from this week'sEarnings Trendsreport. You can access the full report that contains detailed   historical actuals and estimates for the current and following   periods,please click here>>>Here is a quick rundown of the key pointsmakeArticleAd();• Total Q1 earnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to be up +6.5% from the same period last year on +6.3% higher revenues.• Q1 estimates came down as the quarter got underway, with the current +6.5% down from +10.4% in late December.• The Energy sector is a big contributor to growth this quarter, with the sector alone accounting for 4 percentage points of the aggregate +6.5% growth.• Technology and Basic Materials are the only sectors with double-digit growth this quarter. Earnings growth is expected to be negative for 6 sectors in Q1, with Transportation having weakest growth of them all at -22.3%.• We have Q1 results from 23 S&P 500 members already (fiscal quarters ending in February). Total earnings for these 23 index members are up +14.5% and their revenues are up +5.1% from the comparable period last year.• The Q1 earnings season has gotten underway already, but it will really get going with the Thursday, April 13th reports from the big banks.While total earnings for the quarter are expected to be up +6.5% from the same period last year, total revenues are expected to be up +6.3%. As we know, actual growth will be higher than this, which could be as high as the +10.4% growth pace that was expected at year-end 2016.You would recall that earnings growth reached +7.4% in the preceding quarter, which was the highest growth pace in two years. Q1 earnings growth will most certainly top what we achieved in 2016 Q4, but the absolute dollar level of Q1 earnings will remain shy of the preceding period's all-time quarterly record by a big margin.Please note that while Q1 estimates have followed this well traversed path that we have been seeing consistently over the last few years, the magnitude of negative revisions compares favorably to other periods. In other words, Q1 estimates have come down, but they haven't come down by as much as has historically been the case. We saw this trend of decelerating negative revisions ahead of the preceding earnings season as well, which justifies the market's favorable view of the overall earnings picture.At the sector level, 9 of the 16 Zacks sectors are expected to earn more relative to the year-earlier period, with earnings growth for the Technology sector expected to be up +10.7% from the same period last year. The sector's strong earnings growth is despite the relatively flattish expectation fromApple(NASDAQ:AAPL-Free Report), with strong growth atAlphabet(NASDAQ:GOOGL-Free Report),Facebook(NASDAQ:FB-Free Report) and easy comparisons atMicron(NASDAQ:MU-Free Report) as big contributors.Earnings growth for the Finance, and Industrials sectors are expected to be in mid-single digits while the Energy sector moves from a modest loss in the year-earlier period to improving positive earnings this quarter. The aggregate dollar amount of earnings improvement is the highest for the Energy sector of all 16 Zacks sectors, with the sector expected to earn a total of $8.1 billion in Q1 vs. a loss -1.6 billion in the year-earlier quarter. If we exclude the Energy sector from the aggregate Q1 earnings tally, earnings growth for the quarter drops to +2.5%.Please note that we have yet to see any 'Trump bump' in estimates to reflect the heightened post-election expectations. Stocks moved ahead of actual legislative changes, but the analysts will raise their estimates only after Congress passes tax and other reforms. Estimates have moved up for the Finance sector, but that's primarily a function of higher interest rates since November 8th.Note: Sheraz Mian manages the Zacks equity research   department.

PayPal Is Still King of Online Payment Services;4/6/2017;"Online commerce continues to surge and take a bigger piece of   the overall retail pie. While this might seem obvious from our   own shopping patterns and those of our friends, the data also   backs up this observation.Earlier this year, the U.S. Census Bureauestimatedthat e-commerce sales for the fourth quarter of 2016 were   $102.7 billion, an approximate 14.3% increase from the fourth   quarter of 2015. For the year, e-commerce sales came in at $394.9   billion, a 15.1% increase from 2015. All this growth occurred   while total 2016 domestic retail sales grew a much more anemic   2.9% from 2015's figures.With online sales growing, investors should note who the   future winners might be in the online payment services space. One   metric that can be used to compare the different players is to   learn which companies have built up a loyal following of engaged   customers. Let's take a look atBrand Keys' Customer Loyalty Engagement Indexto see how they stack up.makeArticleAd();Online and mobile commerce continues to explode. Image     source: PayPal Holdings Inc.The Customer Loyalty Engagement Index examines the   relationships customers have with 740 brands across 83   categories. While Brand Keys doesn't fully reveal how they   determine their rankings, the consulting group does tell us:The Brand Keys data paints a detailed picture of the     category drivers that engage customers, engender loyalty and     drive real profits.These drivers not only define how the consumer will view the     category, compare offerings, and, ultimately, buy, but also     identify the expectations the consumer holds for each driver.     The brand whose drivers come closest to meeting (or even     exceeding) those of the category Ideal is always the one whose     customers will demonstrate the highest levels of engagement and     loyalty over the next 12 to 18 months.Rounding out the top fiveImage source: Square Inc.In the online payment services category,Square Inc(NYSE: SQ) placed fifth. Square is perhaps best known for making   it easy for small merchants to accept credit card payments with a   simple attachment to an iPhone, but has recently been growing itsecosystemwell beyond its card-reading products.Amazon.com's(NASDAQ: AMZN) Amazon Payments placed fourth in the category.   The platform allows customers to use the payment methods stored   on their Amazon.com accounts to make purchases at third-party   websites. In early February, Amazon issued a press release on theprogressAmazon Payments had made over the past year and the numbers were   nothing if not impressive: 33 million customers had now used Pay   with Amazon to make a purchase, more than half the customers   using the payment platform were also Prime members, and the   number of merchants accepting the platform had grown 120% year   over year.Alphabet Inc's(NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) Google Wallet finished third.   The app allows the user to send money to family and friends via   the app, online, or through a Gmail account. There are also a few   commercial transactions where customers can use the app. The   neatest feature might be that users can send money to anyone with   an email address or phone number and the recipient doesn't need   to have the app to accept the payment.In second place came private company Stripe. Stripe makes it   easy for individuals and merchants to accept online payments   through a website. Stripe is raising capital that values the   company at $9.2 billion and has no plans to go public anytime   soon.But the online payment champion is still...Image source: PayPal Holdings Inc.Take a bow,PayPal Holdings Inc(NASDAQ: PYPL) . PayPal recently took the opportunity to pat   itself on the back when it almost simultaneously reached 200   million active accounts and 50 million One Touch users. One Touch   has become the most rapidly adopted product in PayPal's history.   The platform allows users to register a device, whether a   smartphone, tablet, or PC, and stay logged into their PayPal   account on that device for forever afterward. This means users do   not have to retrieve their login information or enter   payment credentials when making purchases on that device. This   can become especially important when dealing with the small   screens on smartphones.Here is what PayPal CEO Dan Schulman said about the platform   during the company's latest conference call, transcript provided   byS&P Global Market Intelligence:One Touch has redefined online checkout. Simply put, it     produces, by far and away, the best conversion rate in the     payments industry by making it faster and simpler for customers     to pay with a single tap. Its adoption has well exceeded our     projection.PayPal has also made it a priority to forgepartnershipsacross the payments industry, which it believes adds orders of   magnitude of convenience and choice to its customers. Schulman   routinely refers to this as being a ""customer champion."" At this   year's Goldman Sachs Technology and Internet Conference, he   said, ""To build a great company over the long term, I think   it is absolutely essential that you embrace the mantra of being a   customer champion, which means that you've got to solve pain   points for your customers, all of them, instead of creating   potentially pain points for them.""The partnerships have allowed PayPal to become much more than   just a button appearing on online checkout screens; it is now a   comprehensive payment platform that can be used for mobile,   online, and in-store purchases.By all appearances, this strategy is working. Active account   growth, user engagement, and total payment volume were all up by   double-digit percentages year over year last quarter. With a   corporate culture focused on solving customers' biggest problems   with the platform, PayPal could well inspire customer loyalty for   years to come.10 stocks we like better than PayPal HoldingsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Everything You Need to Know About Comcast's Xfinity Mobile;4/6/2017;"On Thursday, cable giantComcast Corp.CMCSAannounced its long-awaited wireless phone service, Xfinity Mobile, that promises to shake up the telecom industry by offering lower prices than other legacy carriers. While the mobile plan will mainly be powered by its 16 million Wi-Fi hotspots, it will also leverage Verizon'sVZwireless network.Comcast is bundling the service with its other Xfinity offerings, but customers must have, at a minimum, Xfinity Internet to sign up for the cable company's new mobile plan.At first glance, though, Xfinity Mobile sounds pretty enticing, and at no extra cost, customers can automatically get up to five phone lines if they choose to add the new plan to their Xfinity Internet service. There are no line-access fees, and Xfinity Mobile includes talk and text with the first 100 megabytes of shared 4G LTE data included.Pricing breaks down as follows:X1 internet and cable package subscribers can get an   ""unlimited"" plan for $45 a month per line.Anyone who subscribes to a Comcast internet service below X1   can get an ""unlimited"" plan for $65 a month per line.You can also pay per gigabyte, in which each GB costs $12.   This is good for someone who thinks they'll only use a small   amount of data per month.Xfinity Mobile plans aren't really unlimited. Like we all are accustomed to, unlimited today really means ""unlimited,"" or unlimited to a certain extent. Comcast says it will reduce speeds after you use more than 20GB of mobile data. But, customers will get access to HD video streaming on all Comcast plans, something that Verizon, AT&TT, SprintS, and T-MobileTMUSonly offer on their highest-tier wireless mobile plans.As for phones, Xfinity Mobile will offer the AppleAAPLiPhone-including the 7, 7 Plus, 6S, 6S Plus, and SE-Samsung smartphones, like the Galaxy S8 and S8+, and Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge, as well as LG's X Power phone. You can either choose to buy the devices upfront or choose a 24-month payment plan, but you cannot bring your own device to the service to start, at least not now; Comcast may add that option in the future.Xfinity Mobile is set to launch by mid-2017, but it's still in the testing phase. So far, Comcast has run limited employee trials of the mobile plan, and today, those tests will expand to the company's entire employee base. Xfinity Mobile is similar to Google'sGOOGLProject Fi, which found success before with the concept of automatically switching between Wi-Fi and network connectivity.Comcast, Mobile Leader?The telecom industry has been evolving over the past few years due to changing consumer preferences, and key players have responded in interesting ways. Most notably, AT&T announced its eyebrow-raising $85 billion deal to buy media company Time WarnerTWXlast year, in addition to its various moves to diversify into the entertainment industry, like its purchase of DirecTV. Verizon has doubled down on digital media as well, with plans to acquire Yahoo'sYHOOcore business.But where does this leave Comcast? Xfinity Mobile is not Comcast's first venture in the wireless market. The cable provider notably joined together with Sprint, Cox Communications, Time Warner Cable, and Bright House Networks on a mobile platform called Pivot back in 2005, but that failed after two years without gaining much traction.Xfinity Mobile will surely stir up this ultra-competitive industry, and it's not that difficult to imagine Comcast as a telecom leader someday. Like AT&T and Verizon, the cable company needed a way to diversify its central business, especially as more and more customers cut the cord and turn to video streaming platforms like NetflixNFLX. Will a wireless phone service be the answer? We'll have to wait and see.Which Stocks are Zacks Experts Talking   About?Stocks in today's headlines may be tempting buys, but how would you like a sneak peek at the stocks Zacks experts recommend?

You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actuals and estimates for the current and following periods,please click here>>>Here is a quick rundown of the key points•    Total Q1 earnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to be up +6.5% from the same period last year on +6.3% higher revenues.•    Q1 estimates came down as the quarter got underway, with the current +6.5% down from +10.4% in late December.•    The Energy sector is a big contributor to growth this quarter, with the sector alone accounting for 4 percentage points of the aggregate +6.5% growth.•    Technology and Basic Materials are the only sectors with double-digit growth this quarter. Earnings growth is expected to be negative for 6 sectors in Q1, with Transportation having weakest growth of them all at -22.3%.•    We have Q1 results from 23 S&P 500 members already (fiscal quarters ending in February). Total earnings for these 23 index members are up +14.5% and their revenues are up +5.1% from the comparable period last year.•    The Q1 earnings season has gotten underway already, but it will really get going with the Thursday, April 13th reports from the big banks.While total earnings for the quarter are expected to be up +6.5% from the same period last year, total revenues are expected to be up +6.3%. As we know, actual growth will be higher than this, which could be as high as the +10.4% growth pace that was expected at year-end 2016.You would recall that earnings growth reached +7.4% in the preceding quarter, which was the highest growth pace in two years. Q1 earnings growth will most certainly top what we achieved in 2016 Q4, but the absolute dollar level of Q1 earnings will remain shy of the preceding period's all-time quarterly record by a big margin.Estimates for Q1 came down as the quarter unfolded, as the chart below shows.Please note that while Q1 estimates have followed this well traversed path that we have been seeing consistently over the last few years, the magnitude of negative revisions compares favorably to other periods. In other words, Q1 estimates have come down, but they haven't come down by as much as has historically been the case. We saw this trend of decelerating negative revisions ahead of the preceding earnings season as well, which justifies the market's favorable view of the overall earnings picture.At the sector level, 9 of the 16 Zacks sectors are expected to earn more relative to the year-earlier period, with earnings growth for the Technology sector expected to be up +10.7% from the same period last year. The sector's strong earnings growth is despite the relatively flattish expectation fromApple(AAPL), with strong growth atAlphabet(GOOGL),Facebook(FB) and easy comparisons atMicron(MU) as big contributors.Earnings growth for the Finance, and Industrials sectors are expected to be in mid-single digits while the Energy sector moves from a modest loss in the year-earlier period to improving positive earnings this quarter. The aggregate dollar amount of earnings improvement is the highest for the Energy sector of all 16 Zacks sectors, with the sector expected to earn a total of $8.1 billion in Q1 vs. a loss -1.6 billion in the year-earlier quarter. If we exclude the Energy sector from the aggregate Q1 earnings tally, earnings growth for the quarter drops to +2.5%.The chart below shows current consensus growth expectations for the following quarters, which reflects a continuation of the positive growth trend going forward.Please note that we have yet to see any 'Trump bump' in estimates to reflect the heightened post-election expectations. Stocks moved ahead of actual legislative changes, but the analysts will raise their estimates only after Congress passes tax and other reforms.

Snap Inc (SNAP) Stock’s Goal-Based Bidding Is Nice, But Won’t Help;4/6/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTo say thatSnap Inc(NYSE:SNAP) has had a tough go of it since its March 2 IPO would be quite an understatement. It's (mostly)one of the analyst community's favorite punching bags,and despite a good first couple of days as a publicly traded company, SNAP stock is now down more than 30% from its March 3 high. Not good.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockAs is the case with all companies, though, not everything the parent company of online messaging service Snapchat does is a trainwreck - there are some things you have to appreciate about the organization. One of those is Snap's recently updated advertising-bidding platform, which takes so-called goal-based bidding to the next proverbial level.Advertising giants likeFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) andAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) may want to take notice.SNAP Stock's Goal-Based BiddingIf the topic and names seems strangely familiar, it may because it was only a week agoFacebook officially launched its version of header bidding… a means of real-time buying and selling of ad space that's more transparent for the buyer and the seller. The publisher knows how much it will be earning per click, and the advertiser knows how and where its ads will appear. The win-win scenario means more efficient spending of advertising dollars.That evolution is just a microcosm of the ongoing improvement of the web's advertising business though. Goal-based bidding is another natural evolution of the business, and one of the few things SNAP stock holders have to feel good about at this time.7 Tech Stocks That Will Crush the Market for YearsIn short, goal-based bidding is exactly what it sounds like. That is, a payment not for an ad impression or a click, but a specific action. In the case of Snapchat, the primary goal its advertisers are seeking isthe installation of a particular app. Once the app is installed on a phone or tablet, revenue becomes infinitely easier to extract from that user.It's not actually a new idea, though it's not an old one either. The market for revenue-bearing app installations is only expected to reach $7 billion by 2020. But, it's a model that plays right into the hand Snap is holding with Snapchat. Whereas users know they can always download an app they found via Facebook or Google, the fleeting nature of Snapchat's messages often makes an app installation a 'now or never' proposition. Out of fear, those consumers often choose 'now.'The Downside of More Efficient BiddingThere are two sides to every coin, of course, and the downside for SNAP stock owners is simply that the more efficient and granulated web advertising becomes, the cheaper it becomes (on a per-click or per-impression basis) for the advertiser, and the less lucrative it becomes for the middleman. Performance-based ad revenue will only exacerbate this trend.One only has to look at the recent results from Alphabet's Google to recognize the adverse undertow. The company's ""aggregate cost-per-click""fell 11% last yearandthe year before, aligning with the premise that advertisers are getting even pickier about their spending as they glean more specific data about users simply because they can.It's in stark contrast to the early days of the web, when advertisers would pay a steep price for placement on high-traffic sites and then hope for the best.One could point out that Snapchat will limit its advertising of a specific app to only the users most likely to install a third-party app, and then cash in big-time when that individual hits the 'install now' button. In the aggregate though, it remains to be seen if the highly narrowed revenue path leads to more revenue, or less. Remember, up until this point, better-targeted web advertising has lowered its overall cost as publishers/venues become more competitive and ad inventory becomes more of a commodity.Bottom Line for SNAP StockKudos to Snap for having the foresight and guts to make this kind of commitment to its advertisers. Although the messaging platform will continue to take a small cut every time an ad is displayed, one has to presume the big payouts will only come when users install an app … something most of them (perhaps all) will never actually do.Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock Plunges on Goldman ""Sell""From that perspective, advertisers will have to love the low-risk/low-cost approach to promoting themselves.As for SNAP stock holders though, goal-based bidding still isn't enough to suggest the company is going to grow into its lofty valuation anytime soon. One has to presume that at least Facebook if not Alphabet's Google will counter with something similar, deflating Snapchat's advantage and sustaining the downward pressure on internet advertising prices.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 Under-the-Radar Stocks to Buy Now for Explosive UpsideThe 7 Best Stocks to Buy for an Income-Rich RetirementCisco Systems, Inc.

Twitter Lite: Twitter Inc (TWTR) Debuts Leaner Version of Service;4/6/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTwitter Inc(NYSE:TWTR) is launching a new version of its social media platform called Twitter Lite.makeArticleAd();Twitter Lite is a leaner version of the social media service for customers with poor wireless connections. The service still includes all of the main features of Twitter, such as Tweets, Direct Messages, Trends and more, but handles it with less data.Another major advantage of Twitter Lite is that it doesn't take up much room on a mobile device. The new service isn't actually an app to download, but is a special version of the company's website for mobile browsers. This means it will only take up about 1MB of space on a mobile device.This means that Twitter users that are hoping to use Twitter Lite will need a web browser on their mobile devices, which shouldn't be a problem. The new way to access Twitter is available for tablets and smartphones. Computer users can also choose to use it if they are looking for a version of the service that looks a little cleaner.Twitter Lite also hasa new data saver mode. Selecting this option will blur images and videos so that they don't automatically load. Users can tap on Tweets with videos and images to see the media. The social media company estimates that this will help reduce data consumption by as much as 70%.10 Clobbered Stocks to Buy That Are About to Get Red-HotTwitter Lite also has special features when used with modern versions ofAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG,GOOGL) mobile Chrome browser.

Even after this dip theSPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust(NYSEARCA:SPY) is still more than 20% higher than the February low. Equity markets as a whole have been behaving like momentum stocks (a.k.a.

This spread has a 75% theoretical chance of success. This is tighter than my usual comfort starting zone but makes sense near all-time highs.Taking both trades, I would have sold an iron condor with +6% and -10% moves from here.

Here's How Snap is Beefing Up Its Advertising Model;4/6/2017;"It's pretty clear now of the full-fledged rivalry between Snap Inc.SNAPand Facebook Inc.FB. Where one just recently made its market debut, and brought with it an immense, dedicated following, the other was committed to stealing its best ideas over the years.This competition likely began in earnest when Snap's co-founder and CEO, Evan Spiegel, turned down Facebook's $3 billion acquisition offer back in 2013, and since then, the tech giant has incorporated almost exact replicas of parts of its app, Snapchat, on Instagram, Whatsapp, Messenger, and now its home Facebook app.Despite Facebook's numerous efforts, Snapchat is incredibly popular, especially among younger users, and at this point, the only way to get a leg up on its biggest rival is through advertising.Over the past few weeks, Snap has been beefing up its core advertising model, and if you take a step back, this could be seen as a move aimed directly at Facebook. At the end of March, the company launcheda new search functionthat lets all the content created by its 158 million users much more accessible. Dubbed ""Stories in Search,"" the feature allows users to search through Stories that are shared through the public.""We've built a new way to understand what's happening in Snaps that are submitted to Our Story, and to create new Stories using advanced machine learning. The results have been amazing: you can search over 1 million unique Stories on Snapchat,"" Snap wrote in a blog post.""Stories in Search"" has the potential to increase engagement, and in turn, monetization. While there was no direct mention of advertising, this clearly opens up a whole new way for Snap to make money through advertising. Like in GoogleGOOGL, TwitterTWTR, and even Facebook, providing users a search functionality gives valuable information to help target ads.In addition to a search function, Snap is rolling out two new methods of ad targeting. According toBusiness Insider, advertisers on Snapchat will now have the ability to target users who are more likely to install the social media app than others. This is called ""goal-based bidding for app installed ads,"" and these types of ads will ask users to swipe up on full-screen video ads that uses machine-learning technology developed by Snap.Advertisers can also target Snapchat users that have previously interacted with other ads they have ran in the app before. For instance, if an advertiser purchases one of Snapchat's Lenses, the app's pricier selfie filters, for a campaign, they can later target those same users again with other types of ads.These new types of advertising will be crucial for Snap going forward, both because of its ongoing rivalry with Facebook and because ad dollars are the main source of revenue for the company. Since its IPO, analysts and investors have wondered how Snap plans to make money-as of now, it's still unprofitable-and innovating its advertising model is a key step to improving its bottom line.Which Stocks are Zacks Experts Talking   About?Stocks in today's headlines may be tempting buys, but how would you like a sneak peek at the stocks Zacks experts recommend?

Alphabet (GOOGL) Launches YouTube TV in Five Metro Areas;4/6/2017;"Alphabet Inc.GOOGLtook the wraps off its own streaming video service YouTube TV yesterday.The service will initially be available in large metro areas such as Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York, Chicago and Philadelphia. More U.S. cities will be added, going forward.Though the news didn't move the needle much for the stock (closed at 848.91, down 0.4%), over the last six months, it has outperformed the ZacksInternet-Servicesindustry. It returned 6% compared to the industry's gain of 2%.Competitive PricingThe YouTube TV subscription service offers over 40 channels alongside YouTube videos and YouTube Red original content for $35 a month.It underscores Alphabet's continuous efforts to launch products and services for multiple industries.With the new move, Google is entering a crowded and highly competitive market marked by the presence of AT&T'sTDirecTV Now, Dish Network'sDISHSling TV and Sony'sSNEPlayStation Vue.The company appears to have its strategy in place. The low price tag will certainly place its competitors in a spot of bother.As the company generates significant cash from operations and also holds a huge cash balance, management has the flexibility to pursue growth in any area that exhibits true potential. This flexibility, along with its technological prowess allows it to pursue opportunities in different markets, offsetting the late-mover disadvantage.Alphabet Inc. Net Income (TTM)Alphabet Inc. Net Income (TTM)|Alphabet Inc. QuoteAttractive FeaturesAlphabet has reached agreements with cable networks like CBS, ABC, NBC, CW, Twenty-First Century Fox and others. In addition, there are affiliated cable channels like CNBC, ESPN, MSNBC, Disney Channel, Fox Sports and its FS1 and FS2 affiliates, Fox News and others.The company said that it will add BBC America, AMC, WE tv, IFC, Sundance TV and BBC World News going forward, at no extra charges. Shudder and Sundance Now, however, will be accessible for an additional fee.Notably, YouTube TV offers some attractive features at a low price point. The subscription can be shared among six accounts, each of which comprises a profile, personalized recommendations and a personal library. A member's experience will not get disturbed by the preferences of others.Other facilities include live programming and fast-forwarding on pre-recorded shows to skip ads. The biggest differentiator seems to be the cloud-based DVR component that allows unlimited storage in the cloud for up to nine months.YouTube TV is accessible through smartphone, tablet and laptop browsers. Watching on television requires Google's Chromecast. Alphabet is offering a free one-month trial and a free Chromecast to early subscribers.Not Free from LoopholesAlphabet didn't strike deals with Discovery, Turner, Viacom, A&E and AMC, which means that subscribers are missing out on History, Comedy Central, HBO, CNN, TNT, TBS, AMC and so on.Though YouTube had unveiled plans to expand the service as quickly as possible, for the time being, viewers from only the places where YouTube offers full live local broadcast feeds will be able to avail it.

Will Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Ever Pay a Dividend?;4/6/2017;"Ultimately the primary task of a corporation is to make money, and eventually to share that money among its shareholders. To this point Alphabet (GOOG,GOOGL) has been incredibly successful in almost everything they've done except this. In other words, it is legitimate for investors to ask if and when Alphabet will distribute profits in the form of a dividend.Let’s face it, if there was ever a company that could afford to pay a dividend to shareholders, it is Alphabet. The company is a giant cash machine, with a market cap of over $580 billion, revenues of over $90 billion, operating cash flow of around $36 billion and with well over $86 billion of cash on hand.It is not a question of being able to pay a dividend, it is simply a question of not wanting to. That attitude was common among tech successes of the internet age, but most have subsequently given in to shareholder pressure and initiated dividend payments.makeArticleAd();Even Apple (AAPL), whose founder Steve Jobs was famously opposed to the idea of the company paying a dividend did so, although admittedly only after his death. Microsoft (MSFT) and others gave in much earlier. Essentially at some point it is possible for any company to amass what is in effect an “embarrassment of riches” and be almost forced into returning some money to shareholders.There are two main ways for companies to do that, by paying a dividend or by buying back stock. So far, Alphabet has relied on buybacks and, as the three year chart below shows, long term stockholders have had little reason to complain.In the opinion of some shareholders, Alphabet is too involved in “moon shot” projects through its “Google X” division that oversees the investment into things like driverless cars and even teleportation and a space elevator. The veil of secrecy that has covered Google X since its inception was lifted somewhat last year, whenit was revealedthat the venture was costing around $3.5 billion per year.That is less than ten percent of annual cash flow, but to shareholders looking for a dividend, it is wasted money.The other use for the cash, M&A, is less controversial in many ways. Buying companies like Nest to diversify away from the core search business is likely to show a quicker return and ultimately contribute to growth. Those calling for a dividend, though, would rightly point out that given the huge cash flow of the company an aggressive M&A program and a dividend are not mutually exclusive.The problem though is that the original owners of Google, including founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, are not really answerable to other shareholders. When the company was restructured into Alphabet, the share classes were also changed, with a new class of powerful voting shares going to those original owners. That gives them permanent power to override other shareholders, so the kind of institutional investor pressure that forced Apple to start paying a dividend cannot be a factor at Alphabet.If Alphabet is to ever pay a dividend, therefore, it would have to make sense to Page, Brin and others with the original Google vision as their driving force. Their opposition to the idea remains intact for now, so something would have to change for that to happen.One possible catalyst could be if President Trump does offer an amnesty window for the repatriation of overseas profits as he has indicated he will, as Alphabet holds a lot of money overseas and tax considerations play are partly involved in the decision not to pay a dividend.The fact is that as long as Alphabet keeps growing revenue and expanding into ever more areas of business, a dividend payment is not just unlikely but also, for most investors, unnecessary. Profits continue to grow and the stock continues to climb and until that situation changes, it is hard to argue that sending money out of the company is a better use for it than where it is currently invested.At some point Alphabet might pay a dividend, but for now, don’t hold your breath."

Will iPhone 8 Launch Delay Cost Apple (AAPL) a Fortune?;4/6/2017;"Apple Inc.AAPLis rumored to delay the launch of its highly anticipated iPhone 8 according to Digitimes, which quoted a Chinese-language report from Economic Daily News (EDN).

Google's (GOOGL) YouTube TV Streams Horror for Competitors;4/6/2017;"It made too much sense to not have existed already. But the waiting game is over — YouTube TV is finally here. Television, as we've always known it, will cease to exist.On Wednesday Alphabet (GOOGL) subsidiary Google's new television experiencelaunchedin major metro markets such as New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, offering cord-cutters a bundle of live programming at $35 per month. And more cities will soon become eligible. What does this mean? The rate of cord-cutting, referring to cable/satellite subscribers who cancelling their bloated TV services in favor of “skinny bundles,” is about to accelerate.YouTube’s package consists of more than 50 channels, including major sports networks such as Disney’s (DIS) ESPN, Fox Sports from FOX (FOX), along with and Comcast’s (CMCSA) SportsNet. Combined with a host of premium broadcast channels such as Disney Channel, Bravo, MSNBC, and Fox News, YouTube TV carries a big punch.makeArticleAd();Notably, the service — at $35/month — falls in line with offerings from AT&T's (T) DirecTV Now and Sling TV from Dish Network (DISH). When considering the recent arrival of PlayStation Vue from Sony (SNE) and Hulu, which plans to launch its own skinny offering later this year, the competition will be intense. And this doesn’t even include Apple (AAPL), which is often regarded as the next major TV entrant.Where YouTube TV may stand out, however, is the fact that it offers a cloud DVR, which Google says offers unlimited storage. The service, which allows six accounts per household — higher than Netflix (NFLX) — not only features customized DVR storage, but also allows for three simultaneous streams per household. Another distinct advantage could be with YouTube’s channel offerings, which includes CBS (CBS) — the top-rated network on television. CBS is not available on either DirecTV Now or Sling TV.Likewise, YouTube TV will soon offer AMC networks (AMCX) — home to top-rated shows such asThe Walking DeadandBetter Call Saul. For consumers who insists on having more choices without being held ransom to bloated channels they pay for (but don't watch), YouTube TV could be a viable option. And for those who crave technology with their TV-watching experience, Google’s massive cloud storage feature and the ability to stream shows across multiple devices will be tough to match, especially with Android dominating the smartphone OS market with a 90% share.Meanwhile, the likes of Charter Communications (CHTR), which recently merged with Time Warner and other cable/satellite TV providers such as Comcast, Dish Network and DirecTV should be terrified. With YouTube already boasting more than 1 billion users worldwide, which amounts to about one-third of all internet users, it was already a force to be reckoned with. And YouTube TV is just the horror scenario they expected, but can’t turn off."

The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights: Amazon.com, Facebook, Twitter and Alphabet;4/6/2017;"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL - April 06, 2017 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog includeAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN-Free Report),Facebook(NASDAQ:FB-Free Report),Twitter(NYSE:TWTR-Free Report) andAlphabet(NASDAQ:GOOGL-Free Report).Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations.Get #1Stock of the Day pick for free.Here are highlights from Wednesday's Analyst   Blog:Amazon Wins NFL Thursday Nights, Beating TwitterAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN-Free Report) continues to diversify its offerings for its Prime members. The company reportedly won the distribution rights to live stream 10 National Football League (NFL) Thursday night games leapfrogging Facebook (NASDAQ:FB-Free Report), Twitter (NYSE:TWTR-Free Report) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL-Free Report) owned Google's YouTube.We note that Twitter had won the rights last season for which it paid $10 million. Reportedly, Amazon offered five times more, i.e. $50 million for the rights to NFL. If the report is true, it will mark Amazon's first major push into live streaming sports, beyond TV shows and movies.The streaming is exclusively available to Prime members and will be shown next fall. Additionally, the company will sell ad slots and promote other video offerings. NFL Network, CBS and NBC will broadcast the same games on television. Verizon will stream the games to its wireless subscribers.We note that Amazon's shares appreciated 54.7% in the last year compared with the Zacks Internet Commerce industry's gain of 43.8%. We believe investors are encouraged by Amazon's Prime expansion and grocery initiatives and its efforts around AWS. The company capitalizes largely on its execution strength, robust performance and technological prowess.Key TakeawayIt appears that Amazon is leaving no stone unturned in pushing advantages to Prime members. This makes sense as Prime's saturation in the U.S. is apparent, owing to Amazon's high penetration rates.So the current focus is on building video content, primarily for Prime subscribers because the growth prospects in that market are considerable. The move is undoubtedly a good tactic to get more people to Prime and generate increased sales for Amazon. However, it will likely put pressure on the company's bottom line, especially if the deal's rumored price tag is true.Currently, Amazon is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.

3 Top Autonomous Car Companies to Buy in 2017;4/5/2017;"When it comes to developing self-driving cars, who are the top   automakers? And which of those have stocks worth buying?Navigant Research recently attempted to answer the first   question. In a newreport, the research firm examined ""the strategy and execution of 18   leading companies developing automated driving systems"" and   ranked the contenders by relative strengths and weaknesses.I think there are reasons to quibble with Navigant's   assessment -- specifically, I think it underweighted companies   that might have good technology but that don't actually build   vehicles at scale right now. But its ranking of automakers is   probably pretty sound, and in its top tier of ""Leaders,"" there   are three that pay nice dividends and could be good buys   right now:Ford Motor Company(NYSE: F) ,General Motors(NYSE: GM) , andDaimler(NASDAQOTH: DDAIF) .makeArticleAd();Ford was one of the first automakers to test self-driving     vehicles in winter conditions. Image source: Ford Motor     Company.FordFord is an intriguing buy right now forseveral reasons, andself-driving is certainly one. The Blue Oval's autonomous-vehicle development effort took a   huge step forward in February with the creation of aFord-funded start-up called Argo AI.Simply put, Argo AI is vehicle that will help Ford hire and   retain the best available software talent in what has become a   fiercely competitive market for the services of top engineers.   Argo's structure gives its employees the opportunities and equity   upside of a start-up with the assurance of an auto giant's   financial backing. (Ford gets dibs on its product, of course --   but it might be offered for sale to other automakers.)Argo AI was co-founded by big-name veterans of self-driving   research programs atAlphabet's Waymo unit and Uber Technologies -- and funded to the tune of   $1 billion by Ford, which is folding its existing self-driving   software team into the new company.Ford hasn't said a lot about its plans on the hardware side.   We do know it plans to begin mass-producing aLevel 4 self-driving vehicle for commercial   useby 2021. Ford also seems to be laying the groundwork for an   integrated ""mobility"" offering of its own that could include   Ford-branded ride-haling and car-sharing services, summoned via a   smartphone app calledFordPass.Meanwhile, Ford's stock is trading at just 6.5 times its 2016   earnings (net of special items), and itsvery sustainable dividendis yielding a fat 5.2%. It may take a few years for Ford's   self-driving investments to show in the bottom line, but they   could generate good growth in time.General MotorsLike old rival Ford, GM's stock is cheap at 5.7 times its 2016   earnings, and it's paying a solid (and again,sustainable) dividend yielding 4.4%.Also like Ford, GM is emerging as a self-driving leader. In   fact, GM may well be ahead: Under CEO Mary Barra, GM tends to let   its products do the talking -- or put another way, GM keeps its   future plans under wraps to a greater extent than many   rivals.But we know a few things:GM owns9% of ride-hailing company Lyft.GM last year bought self-driving start-up Cruise Automation     and made Cruise the center of its self-driving software     effort.GM is building out its OnStar network to serve connected     vehicles with high bandwidth.GM started anurban car-sharing servicecalled Maven early last year, and it's growing quickly.We know one other thing: GM is shipping an innovative electric   car, the Chevy Bolt, which is designed to be a ""platform"" (GM's   term) for developing connected-vehicle and self-driving   technologies and bringing them to market. The Bolt is also, by   design, very well-suited for urban ride-hailing and car-sharing   duties.See the picture that's emerging? Here's a hint.GM CEO Mary Barra with a Chevy Bolt EV from GM's     self-driving test fleet. Image source: General Motors.Reportedly, GM will soon -- as in, within the next few months   -- build ""thousands"" of Bolts withprototype Level 4 self-driving systemsfor an extensive multicity test with Lyft. The data harvested   from that effort -- and the fact that the Bolt is already in mass   production today, and the self-driving prototypes will be   built on the Bolt's regular assembly line -- could put GM at the   forefront of the early commercialization of self-driving   technology, with obvious (good) implications for the General's   bottom line.DaimlerDaimler is mostly known to American investors as the owner of   the Mercedes-Benz brand. Less well-known is that it's also a   major player in heavy trucks and buses, with several brands   including Freightliner, Western Star, Thomas Built, and Setra,   along with Mercedes-Benz's own commercial-van and medium and   heavy truck lines.That gives it at least two separate and intriguing ways to   bring its self-driving technology to market. Daimler already has   an agreement with Lyft's larger rival, Uber Technologies, to   supply self-driving vehicles in a few years. It's known to be   working with Uber, giantauto supplier Bosch,NVIDIA, and other big names to finish and commercialize a Level 4   systemover the next couple of years.That system won't just go in cars for Uber duty, though. It'll   almost certainly be offered as a luxury option on Mercedes-Benz   vehicles -- and it'll definitely have a place in Daimler's big   trucks.This photo, taken during a demonstration on the Autobahn last   year, nicely sums up one of Daimler's big opportunities.Image source: Daimler AG.The three trucks are traveling in an automated convoy, led by   the first truck -- which, as you can see from the position of the   driver's hands, is driving itself. I'm sure you can also see the   huge commercial implications.Right now, Daimler is trading at about 8.4 times its 2016   earnings per share (7.97 euros). That's not as cheap as Ford or   GM, but it's still fairly inexpensive for a company that   generates much of its revenue from luxury products. It's also   cheap enough that Daimler's generous dividend (3.25 euros) means   a 4.8% dividend yield.Again, you'll have to wait a while for the benefits of this   technology to accrue to Daimler's bottom line. But as with Ford   and GM, you'll get paid to wait -- and you might be quite happy   with the result in several years.10 stocks we like better than FordWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

GoPro Inc: Bulls Need a Reality Check;4/5/2017;"In less than three years,GoPro(NASDAQ: GPRO) went from being one of the hottest stocks on Wall   Street to being one of the most hated. GoPro surged from its IPO   price of $24 to nearly $90 in late 2014, but plummeted to the   single digits as demand for its action cameras cooled. Many   investors clearly believe that further downside is ahead, with    32% of shares still being shorted as of March 24.But whenever a stock falls so much, contrarian bulls emerge.   GoProrallied stronglylast month after it announced a third round of layoffs. Citi   analysts subsequently upgraded the stock from  Sell to   Neutral, noting that its revenue growth would likely stabilize,   it would reach its non-GAAP profitability targets, and that it   probably wouldn't need to access its credit facility to stay   afloat. That upgrade likely convinced some bulls that the stock   was finally bottoming.GoPro's Karma drone. Image source: GoPro.makeArticleAd();But here's my message to those hopeful investors: it's time   for a reality check. GoPro's track record of broken promises and   its lack of compelling new products indicate that the bears are   probably still right about this beaten-down stock.Why GoPro crashed in the first placeGoPro's crash is often attributed to competition in the action   camera market, the overall saturation of that market, and the   longevity of existing devices making upgrades unnecessary for   most users. Meanwhile, improving smartphone cameras made carrying   around a separate action camera -- especially one that cost as   much as a mid-range phone -- seem pointless for mainstream   users.However, GoPro's decline was also exacerbated by blatant   exaggerations. When GoPro went public, it declared that it could   become a ""media company,"" but thoseplans collapsedlast year and it laid off most of the division, which   included costly hires from other tech and media companies. GoPro   also repeatedly promoted virtual reality as its next growth   market, even though the only VR products it offered were two   expensive multi-camera rigs (the $5,000 Omni and $15,000 Odyssey)   which cost thousands of dollars.GoPro's Odyssey (L) and Omni (R) VR rigs. Image source:     GoPro.Those devices were so expensive thatAlphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google -- which co-developed the   Odyssey with GoPro -- opened up YouTube's VR/360 channels to   cheaper camera makers like Yi Technology, Ricoh, and 360fly.   GoPro responded to that move by launching its own VR app and   site, GoPro VR, but that effort reached far fewer viewers than   its YouTube channel. CEO Nick Woodman also  vaguely hinted   at the development of a stand-alone 360-camera over the    past year, but that device probably won't arrive anytime   soon.GoPro's management blunders are also easy to see. The company   priced the Hero 4 Session too high in 2015, then took big   writedowns by repricing ittwice. It wasted nearly $36 millionbuying backits own shares before they were cut in half. It botched the   launch of the Karma drone, its most eagerly anticipated product   of 2016, with a humiliating recall. It continues developing all   of its new products -- drones, handheld stabilizers, and VR rigs   -- asaccessoriesfor selling more action cameras, instead ofexpandinginto brand new product categories.Why the bulls think GoPro can recoverAfter all those missteps, the bulls basically believe that   three rounds of layoffs -- which downsized its media and VR units   while reducing its headcount from 1,500 to 930 -- will stabilize   GoPro's business and help it achieve non-GAAP profitability   again. They probably also believe that GoPro's low EV/sales ratio   of 0.8 and its clean balance sheet will limit its downside   potential and make it a lucrative buyout target.Unfortunately, downsizing in the face of rising competition   will likely reduce GoPro's brand presence, throttle innovation,   and lead to more quality control issues like the Karma disaster.   GoPro also hasn't offered any viable solutions to counter the   competition in action cameras, drones, or smartphones, and it's   been slow to respond to new product categories like stand-alone   360-degree cameras andaugmented reality glasses. Wall Street believes that  GoPro's revenue will rise 7%   this year and 2% to $1.3 billion next year -- but that will still   be well below the $1.62 billion in revenue it generated in   2015.If a bigger company wanted to buy GoPro, which has an   enterprise value of less than $1 billion, it also would have   likely made a move by now. Yet no serious reports about buyouts   ever surfaced, indicating that it's simply cheaper for bigger   companies likeGarminto develop in-house action cameras instead of inheriting   all of GoPro's problems.Why a reality check is in orderI owned GoPro stock before, and Ionce believedin the company's promises of expanding its brand into a media   ecosystem and growing in adjacent markets. But then the hard   truth set in -- the company was a one-trick pony without a moat,   and the management repeatedly failed to launch products on time   or even price them correctly. These failures indicate that while   layoffs might slow GoPro's decline this year, they won't likely   help the stock rebound.10 stocks we like better than GoProWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Did Amazon Score a Touchdown with Its $50 Million NFL Deal?;4/5/2017;"Amazon.com, Inc.AMZNjust paid $50 million to stream 10 NFL games during the upcoming 2017 season. The internet giant's move into live sports coverage has grabbed headlines, but does it mean that internet power players are set to take a bite out of television's last big cash cow?The NFL agreed to a one-year deal with Amazon valued at around $50 million that will see the online retail giant live stream 10 ""Thursday Night Football"" games for its Amazon Prime members. Amazon will not have exclusive rights to these 10 games, as the NFL's big television partners, CBS, NBC and its own NFL Network, will split up coverage of the same 10 games for the traditional broadcast and cable television audience.Amazon outbid other giants such as Alphabet Inc.'sGOOGLGoogle, Twitter Inc.TWTR, and Facebook, Inc.FBfor the 10-game NFL streaming package.Amazon's stock was up 0.27% to $909.28 per share Wednesday. Amazon is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).An estimated 60 million households use Amazon Prime. The membership includes the popular shipping incentives, but it also includes Amazon's ever-growing music, movies and TV offerings.Even as Amazon continues to expand its core business and grow its artificial intelligence and cloud computing sectors, the company seems poised to keep pushing heavily into the media content business. Amazon already produces its own original television programming, which includes the Emmy Award-winningTransparent. Amazon also recently put Hollywood on notice whenManchester by the Seatook home two Oscars.The Seattle-based company wants to give its Prime members not only more choices, but also more reasons to keep paying the $99 annual fee that includes free two-day shipping, as well as other services. ""We're focused on bringing our customers what they want to watch, Prime members want the NFL,"" Amazon Senior Vice President Jeff Blackburn told theWall Street Journal.The Thursday night NFL deal represents a win for Amazon over some of its rivals, but does the small one-year, $50 million deal truly matter to a company that has shook up the retail industry for good and is now set to take on global shipping giants?In short: Yes, it really does. Amazon is just starting its long-term game to eventually become a live sports content power. This move has the potential to change TV forever.Now let's take a look at the big picture to get a better understanding of what Amazon hopes to do with its new NFL deal.2017 ImpactLast year, Twitter broke into the NFL with its ""Thursday Night Football"" deal. Twitter's $10 million deal represented a step forward in the fight between non-traditional media companies and legacy media outlets to control live content.In 2015, Yahoo! Inc.YHOOpaid $17 millionto live stream NFL games in London. Yahoo's live stream, which played automatically on its homepage, reached an estimated15.2 million people. However, the average viewership per minute was only 2.36 million.Twitter's foray into the NFL last year was even less successful. The average Twitter viewership for the 10 Thursday night games at any givenminute was 266,000, compared to 15.8 million for the same games on broadcast and cable television.So if the numbers aren't that great, why did Jeff Bezos' company pay $40 million more than Twitter did last year for its new NFL streaming deal? Paying $50 million for roughly 30 hours of coverage isn't crazy for a company with a market cap of $439 billion. Still, the answer is even more straightforward: Amazon is now in the live content business.The two deals are almost identical in terms of content and overall coverage hours. But Twitter streamed its NFL games for free. Amazon's users have to pay the $99 per year Amazon Prime fee in order to watch the ""Thursday Night Football"" games.But it's not about making money now, it's about offering more content. Movies, TV and now live sports will make Prime a long-term power in the content business as cable television's viability declines further every day.The NFL deal allows Amazon to offer a historic American product, and with that comes more creditability in the content world.Amazon doesn't necessarily see its new NFL deal as a money making move now, although it could end up profiting from the partnership by pushing NFL merchandise. But every company needs to have a proof of concept before it can really go to market and make it big.Amazon is simply testing the live sporting waters in 2017 for a very small fee, and its first test subject isn't a random league or game, it is the National Football League. Bezos and Amazon are investing in the future, and the future is live sports streaming on televisions, phones and tablets around the U.S. and the world.When Will The Future of Sports Arrive?Americans pay massive monthly cable fees in order to access hundreds of channels. However, most people only watch a few of the channels they pay for.According to Nielsen, in 2013, the average cable package provided 189 channels, but people watched an average of only 17.5 channels.This has helped lead to a cord-cutting revolution. The array of content that Netflix Inc.NFLX, HULU and Amazon offer have helped lure the mostly-millennial audiences to leave cable television behind.Amazon has already looked into live rights for the NBA, soccer, surfing and Indian Premier League cricket. The NFL marks a giant win on a small scale. If Amazon can prove the viability of its NFL streaming, then other leagues and live sporting events could soon join the party.The NFL and Amazon already have a working relationship. In 2016, Amazon debuted its NFL Films-produced behind-the-scenes series ""All or Nothing,"" which documented the Arizona Cardinals' entire 2015 season over eight roughly 50-minute episodes. Season two, which will feature the Rams' first season back in Los Angeles in 2016,was just announced.But none of the video on demand power players have ever really owned live sports rights until now. Some of the NFL's current TV rights deals will expire in less than a decade. Once the streaming services own live sports rights, television, as we know it, will be changed forever.OvertimeAmazon has to wait 15 years before it can try to win rights to the Olympics or NCAA March Madness, which are both tied up through 2032. However, look for Amazon to potentially bid on both the English Premier League and Major League Soccer in five years when the current TV deals expire. The global and youthful appeal of soccer could officially kick-off the live streaming sports era.Which Stocks are Zacks Experts Talking About?makeArticleAd();Stocks in today's headlines may be tempting buys, but how would you like to peek behind the curtain to see all the best stocks Zacks' team of experts are recommending?

Uber Admits to Finding Allegedly Stolen Waymo File;4/5/2017;"The ongoing legal dispute between Alphabet Inc.GOOGLand Uber just took an interesting turn. The ride-sharing company admitted in court Wednesday that it found one of the documents that Waymo-formerly the Google self-driving car project-claims was stolen by a former employee.According to a new report fromTechCrunch, Uber's attorney revealed that the company found one of the allegedly stolen documents on a personal device belonging to Sameer Kshirsagar, one of the three people that Waymo has accused of stealing its trade secrets.Kshirsagar is accused of stealing several key documents before he left Waymo to join Uber, but Alphabet's primary complaint surrounds Anthony Levandowski, a former member of Google's self-driving car team that left the project to found autonomous trucking company Otto (also read:Alphabet Suing Uber Over Self-Driving Car Technology).Otto was launched in May, 2016 and acquired by Uber just two months later.Levandowski is accused of downloading a whopping 14,000 confidential files, including Waymo's LiDAR circuit board designs, to an external disk drive using specialized software. In an effort to cover his track, Levandowski allegedly download a new OS to his company laptop in order to delete information.Alphabet was first alerted to the potential theft when an Uber supplier inadvertently copied a Google executive in an email titled ""Otto files."" The message was being sent to people that at Uber that Google thinks were working on self-driving technology.Uber has reportedly many of its employees' devices, and the company maintains that none of the allegedly stolen files ever made it to Uber. It's important to note that today's revelation only points toonedocument on apersonaldevice, which is a far cry from thousands of documents circulating around between Uber employees.Nevertheless, the battle between Waymo and Uber will rage on for the time being. For Uber, the case is just another item on the growing list of controversies andcompetitionthat could threaten its future, especially as investors grow more eager for anIPO.Which Stocks are Zacks Experts Talking About?Stocks in today's headlines may be tempting buys, but how would you like to peek behind the curtain to see all the best stocks Zacks' team of experts are recommending?

3 Drone Stocks to Buy Now;4/5/2017;"You've probably heard of drones by now, and technically speaking, it's a type of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), meaning a drone is an aircraft that flies by itself with no pilot or passengers.Drones have been used for years by the U.S. military, but are now just starting to be utilized commercially for consumers. E-commerce giant AmazonAMZNis testing drones to deliver packages, fast-casual restaurant company ChipotleCMGwants to use dronesto deliver its burritos, hobbyists can purchase GoPro'sGPROKarma drone to achieve ""Hollywood-caliber footage,"" and that's just the tip of the iceberg.The drone industry is rapidly changing, and investors have taken notice. With this in mind, check out these three drone technology stocks that show promise in this burgeoning industry.STMicroelectronics NVSTMSTMicroelectronics is a global semiconductor company that designs, develops, manufactures, and markets a broad range of semiconductor integrated circuits and discrete devices used in a wide variety of applications. Currently, Swiss-based STMicroelectronics is known for its chip research for 3-D printing and ""Internet of Things"" operations, but it also is exploring chips for drones.STMicro is a #2 (Buy) on the Zacks Rank, with a VGM score of 'A.' Its earnings growth estimates, however, are insane. For the current quarter, STM expects year-over-year earnings growth of over 760%, with one upward revision compared to none lower. STMicro is also in a strong industry,Semiconductor-General, which sits in the top 10% out of all industries ranked on the Zacks Industry Rank.Lockheed MartinLMTOne of the biggest aerospace and defense giants today, Lockheed Martin is already responsible for many of the drones used by the U.S. military, and it continues to put its drone business front and center. Lockheed is also looking to begin manufacturing armed drones, which could be a big boon to its bottom line, especially if the Department of Defense continues to support the sale and use of them internationally.Lockheed Martin currently holds a #2 (Buy) on the Zacks Rank, with a VGM score of 'C.' Its industry,Aerospace-Defense, rests in the top 30% of all industries ranked on the Zacks Industry Rank, and this could improve if President Trump's defense budget gets approved. Lockheed has posted an earnings beat for the past four consecutive quarters, and has an average surprise of 12.41%. For the current quarter, the company expects year-over-year earnings growth of 5.43%.AeroVironmentAVAVDespite its #3 (Hold) on the Zacks Rank, AeroVironment is probably the purest play option for those looking to invest in drones, apart from rival DJI, which is still a privately-held company. AeroVironment is a profitable, small-cap company that has both military and civilian clients, and itsRaven drone modelis the most widely-used small-scale drone in the world.AVAV stock, however, does have a volatile history, but some of its earnings growth does look promising. For the current quarter, AeroVironment expects year-over-year earnings growth of about 330% and year-over-year sales growth of roughly 44%, and has an average earnings surprise of 73.68%. If investors want a pure play drone option, AeroVironment is their best bet, but it's risky a one, so stay cautious.Bottom LineLike all new technologies, drones are continuously changing, and new investment opportunities will likely arise as the technology evolves. Don't be surprised if other tech giants like AlphabetGOOGLbeef up their drone offerings, following in Amazon's footsteps. But if you're looking to add drone stocks to your portfolio today, the list above is a good place to start.For more information on the drone industry, check out a special episode of the Zacks Friday Finish Line, where Content Writer Ryan McQueeney and Editor Maddy Johnson were joined by Andrew Chanin, the CEO of PureFunds, to discuss the PureFunds Drone Economy Stretegy ETFIFLY, the first ETF to focus on the emerging commercial drone market.Which Stocks are Zacks Experts Talking   About?Stocks in today's headlines may be tempting buys, but how would you like a sneak peek at the stocks Zacks experts recommend?

Salesforce.com, Inc. (CRM) Stock Is Hot, But Stay Away … For Now;4/5/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSalesforce.com, Inc.(NYSE:CRM) has had a fantastic 2017, up 25% for the year-to-date. And that continued Wednesday after analysts at Merrill Lynch put shares on its coveted list of top buys.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockOn the news, CRM stock is up about 3%. In fact, for the year so far, the return is an impressive 20%, roughly.There are plenty of reasons to be upbeat on CRM stock. The company is the pioneer of the fast-growing cloud computing industry and has a broad array of applications that go beyond customer relation management, such as marketing automation, hosting, customer service and analytics.Even though CRM has been around since the late 1990s, the company is growing as if it were a scrappy startup. In the latest quarter, revenues jumped by 27% to $2.29 billion and cash flows came to $706 million, up 50%. Deferred revenues also rose by 29% to $5.54 billion.7 Tech Stocks That Will Crush the Market for YearsAs for the Merrill report on CRM stock? The analysts point out that revenues could double within the next three to four years. The main reason is the Einstein platform, which provides sophisticated AI (Artificial Intelligence) across the company's apps.AI and CRM StockHere's what CRM CEO Marc Benioff had to say about the cutting-edge Einstein technology in the latestearnings call:""We showed [a customer that] with a simple camera, they're able to do real-time inventory analysis of their retailer shelves and they're able to, based on that analysis that's happening from those cameras, understand the competitive environment, number one. Number two, understand their own environment, and number three, when they are seeing a level of depletion on the shelves that they want to replace, they can just roll trucks automatically using Salesforce Einstein.""While all this sounds great, there should still be some skepticism. AI is definitely not exclusive to CRM. Many other mega tech operators - likeMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT),Alphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) andAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) - are plowing huge amounts of resources into the category.These companies also have the key advantage of huge consumer user bases, which allows for more learning. Offerings like Alexa, Cortana and Google Assistant are quickly becoming well-known brands in AI. This is definitely not the case with Einstein.But there are some other things to consider.The competitive environment for cloud computing is getting more intense - and will likely see more pricing pressure. Even Salesforce's core customer relationship management business has a few vulnerabilities.Keep in mind that Microsoft's $26.2 billion acquisition ofLinkedInwill provide a big boost to the company's own CRM platform, which include Dynamics and Sales Navigator.The massive amounts of LinkedIn user data - which boasts more than 467 million users - will be key for AI functions. Plus, LinkedIn will enjoy powerful synergies with other MSFT products like Office, Skype, SharePoint and Azure hosting.Is it any wonder that Benioff said that the LinkedIn/Microsoft deal was""anticompetitive""?Microsoft may ultimately be the biggest threat to the growth of CRM stock. Perhaps this is why there were discussions for a merger acouple years ago.Since then, CRM has engaged in an aggressive M&A campaign to remain competitive. For the past year or so, the companyhas acquired 11 companies. Some also sported high price tags, such as the $750 purchase of Quip and the $2.8 billion deal forDemandware. It can be extremely difficult to integrate multiple deals in a short period, as you risk problems with staffing, sales productivity and product quality.Buy the Axon Enterprise Inc (TASR) Stock Dip Now!Finally, CRM stock is trading at steep levels, with the forward price-earnings ratio at a hefty 50X. By comparison, Microsoft has a multiple of only 20.Despite what Merrill says, you may want to wait for a better price on CRM stock before putting it on your own conviction list.Tom Taulli runs the InvestorPlace blogIPO Playbookas well asOptionExercise.com, which provides interactive tools & services for employee stock options of pre/post IPO companies.Follow him on Twitter at@ttaulli.

Here's Why Salesforce.com (CRM) Stock Popped Today;4/5/2017;"Shares of Salesforce.comCRMwere up nearly 3.4% in early afternoon trading hours after it was granted a new classification from the Department of Defense that would allow government organizations to use the cloud computing company's tools with certain types of controlled information.The new classification gives Salesforce Government Cloud authorization at Impact Level 4, or IL 4 for short. With this IL 4 certification, government agencies and employees are free to use Government Cloud for controlled, unclassified information. This includes personally identifiable and health-related information.Today's price movement can probably also be attributed to the continued speculation that Salesforce may be a takeover target for another large tech company. Many investors have suggested that a buyout is needed for Salesforce as its growth has begun to slow.While there have been no clear links between Salesforce and any potential suitors,Mad Moneyhost Jim Cramer made a compellingargumentfor Alphabet Inc.GOOGLto purchase the cloud company earlier this year.Salesforce has also been rumored to be considering expansion through its own acquisitions, as the company was heavily linked to struggling social media platform TwitterTWTRlast year.As for now, any M&A-related news surrounding Salesforce remains speculation, but this company will surely continue to attract attention as the technology sector continues its nice run.Which Stocks are Zacks Experts Talking About?Stocks in today's headlines may be tempting buys, but how would you like to peek behind the curtain to see all the best stocks Zacks' team of experts are recommending?

Apple Inc. (AAPL) iPhone 8 May Be Delayed Until November;4/5/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsEveryone is expectingApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) to release its 10th anniversary iPhone 8 in September. Consumers, wireless providers, retailers and AAPL investors. Apple's new ultra-premium flagship is going to be a big deal and September is the month when new iPhones are typically launched. However, there may be a problem with that timeline. A new report out today says the advanced technology Apple is using is causing manufacturing problems in the supply chain.makeArticleAd();Source: AppleAs a result, the company may be forced to move the iPhone 8 launch to October or even November.The iPhone 8 is Expected to Incorporate New TechnologyApple has been making a big deal about 2017 being the 10th anniversary of the iPhone. While the company is expected to release an iPhone 7s - the usual spec bumped version of last year's model - it is also hard at work on the iPhone 8. This would be an ultra-premium smartphone positioned above the iPhone 7.The technology Apple is packing in this 10th anniversary edition is rumored to include curved OLED panels - an Apple first, although they have been used by rivalSamsung(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) for several years.The new iPhone is also expected to pack arevolutionary 3D FaceTime camera, which could be a key component of AAPL's augmented reality plans. These new features are a big part of the reason whyApple could be charging $1,000 or morefor its 10th anniversary iPhone.7 Tech Stocks That Will Crush the Market for YearsUnfortunately, they're also causing some problems that could result in an iPhone 8 delay, at least according toDigiTimes, the Chinese website that tracks Apple and its supply chain.Manufacturing Challenges Could Derail iPhone 8 LaunchThis morning,DigiTimesbroke the news on the potential setback.""Technical issues related to the lamination process of curved OLED panels, and the adoption of a 3D sensing system may cause the delay of the new iPhone devices.""Manufacturing delays related to incorporation of advanced new technology have derailed launch plans for several high-tech companies lately.GoPro Inc(NASDAQ:GPRO)faced a shortageof its new Hero5 Black action camera going into the holiday season because of a manufacturing problem.Fitbit Inc(NYSE:FIT) also stumbled going into the holidays when manufacturing issues meant it wasunable to ramp up volume productionon its new Flex 2 fitness tracker. Apple itself ran into production glitches that causedshortages of the iPhone 5at launch.Potential Impact on the iPhone 8 LaunchApple is looking for September to be a monster month and if the iPhone 8 launched gets delayed until October or even November, as theDigiTimesreport suggests, that's going to throw a serious wrench in the company's plans.MacRumorssuggests several scenarios. AAPL may still go ahead with the usual September iPhone event, but use that to showcase the iPhone 7s and 7s Plus, holding a separate iPhone 8 launch later in the year. Or, it may launch the iPhone 7s in September, but also announce the iPhone 8 - with a later release date.Why Wells Fargo & Co (WFC) Stock Won't Stay DownThere's also a possibility that the company may be able to eke out enough iPhone 8 production to go ahead with the September launch, but with very limited iPhone 8 quantities until later in the year.Regardless of the scenario, it's continuing to look like AAPL is not going to entirely get its way with the iPhone 8 launch. The hype will be there and undoubtedly there will be line-ups of people ready to fork out $1000-plus for a new iPhone. The question is, will Apple be able to get an iPhone 8 to them before they get tired of waiting and a buy an iPhone 7s - or worse, one of the competition's new phones - instead?As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceThe 5 Best Stocks to Buy for April7 'Best of the Best' Stocks to Buy for the Second QuarterOwners of Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Now Have Another Threat -- AmazonThe postApple Inc.

But that thesis is about to be proven wrong.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockOn Monday, the Menlo Park, Calif.-based company announced that its first quarter 2017 financial results will be released after market close on Wednesday, May 3. This could have huge implications for FB stock.I expect Facebook, which closed Monday at $142.28, to rally at least 5% higher into earnings, putting FB stock -which I told you would rise to $160- right around $150 per share.There's growing concern that the so-called Trump rally, which catapulted theDow Jones Industrial Averageand S&P to all-time highs, has begun to fade. As such, I would agree that FB stock is no bargain at all-time highs, either.But Facebook - the ""F"" in FANG - has too many growth levers, including its own attack on Snapchat andTwitter Inc(NYSE:TWTR), to be held back. The company's strategic move into video, which Mark Zuckerberg has successfully executed, has rewarded Facebook with sizable portion of of advertisers' dollars.To that end, Facebook, which boasts more than 1.6 billion monthly active users, is able to neutralizeAlphabet Inc's(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) advertising juggernaut YouTube. With the company now approaching 2 billion users, when combined with assets such as Instagram and WhatsApp, that translates to massive advertising network poised to generate billions in predictable revenue growth for Facebook. And to say nothing about the company's ability to expand internationally.7 Tech Stocks That Will Crush the Market for YearsWhen considering that half of the Facebook's revenue comes from North America, this suggests there's an underserved addressable market overseas that Facebook can tap into to grow its web traffic.And this justifies Zuckerberg's decision to increase capital spending. Meanwhile, although Zuckerberg - at the same time - warned of slowing ad revenue, which in the third and fourth quarters spooked investors. I expect Facebook's revenue guidance this time to surprise to the upside.Bottom Line for FB StockApril has consistently been a good month for stocks over the past several years and I don't expect things to be different this time.Considering that Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg continues to operate with pinpoint execution, I continue to maintain my $160 target on FB stock, using the premise that it should be owned, not traded.As of this writing, Richard Saintvilus did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace3 Reasons to Buy Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock Right Now11 A-Plus Stocks That Are on Bernstein's 'Buy List'3 Entertainment Stocks to Buy as Summer ApproachesThe postWhy Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Is Going to $160appeared first onInvestorPlace."

Amazon Wins NFL Thursday Nights, Beating Twitter;4/5/2017;"Amazon.com, Inc.AMZNcontinues to diversify its offerings for its Prime members. The company reportedly won the distribution rights to live stream 10 National Football League (NFL) Thursday night games leapfrogging FacebookFB, TwitterTWTRand AlphabetGOOGLowned Google's YouTube.We note that Twitter had won the rights last season for which it paid $10 million. Reportedly, Amazon offered five times more, i.e. $50 million for the rights to NFL. If the report is true, it will mark Amazon's first major push into live streaming sports, beyond TV shows and movies.The streaming is exclusively available to Prime members and will be shown next fall. Additionally, the company will sell ad slots and promote other video offerings. NFL Network, CBS and NBC will broadcast the same games on television. Verizon will stream the games to its wireless subscribers.We note that Amazon's shares appreciated 54.7% in the last year compared with the Zacks Internet Commerce industry's gain of 43.8%. We believe investors are encouraged by Amazon's Prime expansion and grocery initiatives and its efforts around AWS. The company capitalizes largely on its execution strength, robust performance and technological prowess.Key TakeawayIt appears that Amazon is leaving no stone unturned in pushing advantages to Prime members. This makes sense as Prime's saturation in the U.S. is apparent, owing to Amazon's high penetration rates.Amazon.com, Inc. Net Income (TTM)Amazon.com, Inc. Net Income (TTM)|Amazon.com, Inc. QuoteSo the current focus is on building video content, primarily for Prime subscribers because the growth prospects in that market are considerable. The move is undoubtedly a good tactic to get more people to Prime and generate increased sales for Amazon.

Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) to Start Handing Out $70M in Refunds for Kids’ In-App Purchases;4/5/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) is going to start handing out more than $70 million in refunds for in-app purchases made by children.makeArticleAd();Source: AmazonThe decision was announced by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) as it brings an end to its drawn out legal battle with Amazon.com, Inc. over the matter. This means that many parents with kids that spent money for in-app purchases should be able to get a refund.According to theFTC, a refund program for in-app purchases made through Amazon.com, Inc. by kids should be announced in the near future. The program will potentially allow parents that had kids making unauthorized purchases from November 2011 to May 2016 to get a refund.""This case demonstrates what should be a bedrock principle for all companies - you must get customers' consent before you charge them,"" Thomas Pahl, Director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection, said in a statement. ""Consumers affected by Amazon's practices can now be compensated for charges they didn't expect or authorize.""The whole case surrounding kids making unauthorized in-app purchases for apps offered by Amazon.com, Inc. came about inApril 2016. A federal court found that the company hadn't gotten proper permission from parents for the purchases. This resulted in a series of appeals from the FTC and AMZN, which are only now coming to an end with this new refund agreement.The 7 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for the Second QuarterAmazon.com, Inc. isn't the only company that has been hit with demands for refunds over in-app purchases made by children.

Can Amazon (AMZN) Dethrone Google, Facebook in Advertising Market?;4/5/2017;"Amazon (Shutterstock photo)The long-standing duopoly that exists between Alphabet (GOOGL) subsidiary Google and Facebook (FB) in the realm of online video advertising may soon become anoligopoly. And, for both incumbents, which togethercontrol 85% of online ad dollars, an oligopoly might be their best-case scenario when considering Amazon (AMZN) may enter the mix.CEO Jeff Bezos doesn’t play to lose.makeArticleAd();Amazon’s advertising business could surge 65% year over year, reaching $3.5 billion in 2017, according to BMO Capital Markets analyst Daniel Salmon, who believes Amazon’s ad prowess may grow into a $150 billion business. Indeed, that’s ways away from $3.5 billion, which currently trails Google’s $52.9 billion (search and ad revenue) and Facebook’s $27 billion in 2016. How much traction can Amazon gain?""A key point of differentiation for Amazon [from competitors] is the massive amount of consumer purchase data it possesses,"" Salmon said in his note Tuesday. ""While Google knows what people are searching for and Facebook knows what people are interested in and who they are connected to, Amazon knows the specific products that customers are purchasing and how frequently they are purchasing these products.”That argument is tough to dispute. Being the dominant force in e-commerce certainly gives Amazon an advantage neither Google nor Facebook can duplicate. But don’t expect Google or Facebook to just roll over, either. According to research firm eMarketer, Google may rake inmore than $42 billionin mobile internet ad revenues in 2017 and $48.05 billion in 2018, while Facebook is expected to gobble up about $30 billion in ad revenue in 2017 and $38 billion in 2018.In terms of total U.S. search ad revenue this year, eMarket expects Google to claim almost 80%, while Facebook will take up about 40% of the display ad market. And when factoring the advertising potential of Snap (SNAP) — parent of popular messaging app Snapchat — Amazon’s ad growth will need to accelerate to meet Salmon’s projections.Nevertheless, Salmon had enough conviction in his thesis to boosts Amazon’s price target to $1,200, while downgrading Alphabet to Market Perform. On the news, investors rushed to gobble up more AMZN shares. AMZN stock closed Tuesday at $906.83, reaching yet another all-time high — the fifth straight session in which it has done so. And as with Salmon, I remain an Amazon bull. The company’s ad business — despite its potential — is just icing on the cake."

Tech Roundup: YouTube Ad Fiasco, Palmer Luckey Leaves FB;4/4/2017;"The top news from last week included Alphabet'sGOOGLYouTube running into serious trouble with advertisers and Oculus founder Palmer Luckey leaving FacebookFB.Here are the details-The YouTube Ad ControversyYouTube will host its Brandcast event on May 4, a marketing event at which it shares success stories while helping brands reach their targeted audiences. So any controversy at this time is bad for YouTube, because it can be used by brands to negotiate advantageous deals for themselves. And that's exactly what seems to be happening...A couple of weeks back, the UK government discovered that its ads were appearing next to inappropriate content and between then and now, around 250 companies operating in the UK including L'Oreal and McDonald's withdrew their UK ads from the platform. Although Google apologized and made changes to its ad platform giving more control to advertisers, big Fortune 500 companies like Pepsi, Starbucks, General Motors, Wal-Mart, J&J, JPMorgan Chase, Ford, AT&T and Verizon pulled their U.S. ads. Analysts currently estimate that the revenue hit could be anywhere between $750 million to a billion dollars.The main problem according to Moody's is the extremely high volumes (400 hours of video are uploaded to YouTube every minute) that make it very difficult to police the content. But because ads placed alongside content that doesn't correspond to the brand's positioning hurts the brand, Moody's thinks it's an objection well taken and would be credit negative.However, the agency says that these brands contribute relatively fewer dollars than the vast majority of YouTube advertisers that continue to spend on the platform and the pullback is in any case temporary because of measures taken by Google. Also, while Google's fix will increase costs related to investments in personnel, A.I. and machine learning to facilitate review of material being uploaded, this won't be so significant as to warrant a change in the current Aa2 investment rating.Bottom line: There are only two really big digital ad-serving platforms (Facebook and YouTube) that draw a very large number of users and it's advantageous for brands to be on both of them. Moreover, the controversy is an industrywide phenomenon with the problem not restricted to YouTube.So while YouTube can't take too hard a stand when negotiating with brands, it may not get pushed into a corner either; more so because it can also point to Google Preferred to access the top 5% content on YouTube (at a premium of course). The bottom line impact will likely also be insignificant because Google is anyway investing in artificial intelligence and machine learning to improve and enhance its algorithms and search results.Palmer Luckey Leaves FacebookOculus co-founder Palmer Luckey is leaving Facebook and it isn't clear whether it was his own decision. But the young face of virtual reality (VR) has been keeping a low profile over the past few months, as a number of things hit his public image. The first was a lawsuit by ZeniMax that Oculus had misappropriated trade secrets while Luckey had violated a non-disclosure agreement.The jury ruled that there was no misappropriation, but Luckey and co-founder Iribe were asked to pay $500 million for the violation of the non-disclosure agreement. To make matters worse, Luckey had invested $10,000 in Nimble America, which some people consider a far right organization. A story by The Daily Beast reporters Gideon Resnick and Ben Collins said that Luckey had written unflattering posts/memes on Hillary Clinton, which apparently led some women to resign from the company.Facebook said, ""Palmer will be dearly missed. Palmer's legacy extends far beyond Oculus. His inventive spirit helped kickstart the modern VR revolution and helped build an industry. We're thankful for everything he did for Oculus and VR, and we wish him all the best.""TickerPrice Change Last WeekPrice Change Last QuarterPrice Change Last 6 MonthsAAPL+2.15%+24.03%+27.07%FB+1.21%+21.12%+10.41%GOOGL+1.52%+4.95%+6.00%MSFT+1.35%+4.13%+15.92%CSCO-0.82%+10.71%+8.67%AMZN+4.88%+16.60%+13.67%Other storiesCorporateIntel's New Strategy Officer: Aicha Evans, the former general manager of Intel'sINTCDevices and Communications Group has been appointed as Chief Strategy Officer. It will be her responsibility to drive Intel's long-term strategy as it moves from the PC centric business model to a more data centric one. She will also be responsible for speeding up decision making and execution of the long term strategy throughout the company.Microsoft's European IoT/A.I. Lab: MicrosoftMSFThas selected Munich, Germany for its third IoT and A.I. Insiders lab (the other two are in Redmond, Washington and Shenzen, China). The purpose of the lab is to provide IoT and A.I. startups necessary facilities (laser cutter, reflow oven, 3D printers) as well as staff with expertise (in IoT hardware, embedded systems software, cloud engineering, IoT, machine learning and A.I.), so they use Microsoft technologies in their development process and facilitate their proliferation. This will help Microsoft become a strong player in the IoT and AI markets, which are still in their very early stages of development.Legal/RegulatoryApple's iPhone Win in China: The Beijing IP Court has ruled that an intellectual property infringement case filed by defunct local manufacturer, Shenzhen Baili Marketing Services Co against AppleAAPLfor the exterior smartphone design was without merit. The court held that the distinctions in design were clear to consumers and that Baili didn't have grounds to claim exclusivity in its designs. Apple said Baili was trying to pass off Apple's designs as its own. Baili's lawyer said the Chinese company would appeal the decision.Since this follows Tim Cook's visit to the country when he promised further investments, it's not clear if the lawsuit was part of the discussions. But in May last year, when the IP Court granted Baili a sales injunction in Beijing against the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, it was immediately suspended pending an appeal from Apple.Apple Wins Against Australian Banks: The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) hasn't granted permission to the four major banks - Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Westpac Banking Corporation, the National Australia Bank, and Bendigo and Adelaide Bank - to collectively bargain for inclusion in Apple Pay or access to Apple's NFC controller. Access would have allowed banks to create their own wallets on Apple devices without paying Apple thus increasing competition with Apple Pay, but the ACCC thought that it would also impact competition between Apple and Google. Apple doesn't allow NFC access to any of its 3,500 banking partners in the 15 markets where Apple Pay is available.UK Wants WhatsApp Backdoor: U.K. Home Secretary Amber Rudd said that she will be meeting with companies like Google, Facebook and Twitter because it was ""absurd to have a situation where terrorists are talking to each other on a formal platform and it can't be accessed."" And again, ""We need to make sure that our intelligence services have the ability to get into situations like encrypted WhatsApp.""The comment followed a finding that Khalid Masood, the terrorist in this case, was active on WhatsApp just two minutes before a blast that killed four people near Britain's Houses of Parliament in Westminster. Needless to say, WhatsApp is ""horrified at the attack,"" but can do little about it because no one, including ""hackers,"" ""oppressive regimes"" or even its own employees can get into the encrypted messages.Developments on Alphabet Case Against Uber: Uber is now saying that since Google has in October, filed for private arbitration against Levandowski for violating confidentiality obligations in his contract to improperly recruit his Waymo colleagues to Otto and Uber, it should also move the allegations of trade-secret theft and unfair competition against Uber into arbitration.The logic is that since both these are related to Levandowski they should be handled similarly. Arbitration proceedings are private and also have different rules related to evidence, which could safeguard Uber's reputation. The company is willing to continue the patent infringement aspect of the case in court.Earlier, Alphabet's Waymo added a fourth patent that it says was infringed upon by Uber and furnished further details including the statement of an eye-witness in a new filing. The statement is from Pierre-Yves Droz, a former colleague and close confidant of Levandowski's (the ex-Googler who has allegedly run off with Waymo self-driving technology and trade secrets to form self-driving trucking company Otto, which was subsequently bought by Uber for $680 million).The lawsuit specifies the time at which Levandowski met Uber executives in Jan 2016, registering the company that would become Otto the following day. Waymo is now seeking an injunction to prevent Uber from using the technology in its self-driving vehicles and seeking damages for any proven infringements.New Technology/ProductsSamsung's New Devices and Services: At the Unpacked event in New York, Samsung launched the Galaxy S8 (i.e. 5.8-inch Galaxy S8 and 6.2-inch Galaxy S8 Plus), the latest of its flagship line of smartphones. The phones are thinner, have bigger displays (bezel-less curved edge called infinity display) and come with Bixby, its new AI cognitive assistant. Samsung also announced the Samsung DeX docking device that allows fast charging of the phone as well as two USB 2.0, Ethernet, USB type-C power-in and a cooling fan that enables users to seamlessly access apps, edit documents, browse the web, watch videos and reply to messages directly from the smartphone on a larger display.An Android desktop experience is also possible by attaching a mouse and keyboard. The phone should be lapped up by consumers but may also have enterprise appeal. Samsung has announced that Citrix and VMware are partners enabling virtualization technologies to work with the phone.Intel Talks 10nm Tech: At its first Technology and Manufacturing Day, Intel has said that it will have 14nm++ technology out this year, offering a 26% performance bump over its 14nm iteration and 12.5% over its 14nm+ tech released last year. It will also offer 20% better transistor performance over competing 14nm and 16nm technology. Intel is making this possible through what it calls hyper scaling technologies that have enabled it to offer superior PPA (Performance, Power, Area) than competitors. It's also using a lithography technology called Self Aligned Dual Patterning for its 14nm, which will be followed up with Self Aligned Quad Patterning for 10nm.Intel thinks that these technologies will enable it to maintain its PPA lead over competing technologies. But the danger remains given that competitors will be moving to 10nm this year and Intel probably won't do that until 2019, at which time they will be serving up 7nm chips. Intel chips may lose their edge around that time, unless there's more in store.Cisco to Separate Networking Software: CiscoCSCOappears to be caving in under the increased competitive pressure in the switching business. The company is now planning to separately sell the networking software that it previously sold along with its switches. This will allow its existing and new customers to use the software along with cheaper switches from competitors such as Broadcom. There should be a resultant negative impact on its switching revenue as some hardware sales will be lost.Cortana to Access Android Lock Screen: Microsoft has signaled its entry into the personal assistant space with the announcement that Cortana will have access to Android's locked screen, offering users in the U.S., UK, and Australia access to things like weather updates, commute times and meeting information without having to first unlock their phones and launch the app. It is also reportedly working on a Cortana-powered home speaker to take on the likes of Amazon's Alexa, Apple's Siri, Google Assistant, Samsung's upcoming Bixby.Amazon has the greatest lead in the space followed by Google and Apple, so the others have their work cut out. This is an increasingly important platform as the larger the ecosystem with which the assistant is connected, the greater the access to data. Voice Labs estimates that in 2015, 65% of U.S. smartphone owners were using voice assistants, up from 30% two years prior. It estimates that shipments of Google Home and Amazon Echo speakers will climb more than threefold to 24.5 million units in 2017 (as reported by Business Insider).Amazon Drone Patents: AmazonAMZNhas filed an application for a couple of drone technology patents. The first is for a ""floating motor mount"" connecting a propeller motor to the body of a drone, for modulation of vibration sounds from the propeller. The second patent is for technology that scans and photographs potential landing or drop-off destinations as the drone descends to the ground, facilitating decisions to speed up or slow depending on any obstructions with respect to the designated ""delivery location identifier"" put out by customers.M&A and CollaborationsAlibaba's Lazada Joins with Unilever: The two companies are collaborating on supply chain, fulfillment, data, marketing, social commerce and talent development to develop their FMCG business in Southeast Asia by wooing middle class spenders. The market is on its way to touch $25 billion by 2020.Which Stocks are Zacks Experts Talking About?While we share information like what you saw in this video with the public, our top recommendations are reserved for selected members.

Google AI Just Beat Human Pathologists at Detecting Cancer;4/4/2017;"The science of deep learning, a sub-discipline ofartificial intelligence(AI), is only a recent development in the grand scheme of   things, but during its short existence, it has been producing   some impressive technological achievements. Advances in image   recognition, language understanding, and translation have led to   the development ofvirtual assistants,smart home speakers,gainsincybersecurity, and are leading the charge towardautonomous driving. Now, companies have found a way to use those AI smarts to fight   cancer.Deep learninginvolves the construction of artificial neural networks, using   software and complex algorithms to recreate the capacity of the   human brain to learn. These learning computers have a particular   knack for sifting through vast amounts of data and recognizing   patterns, getting smarter as they go. The first breakthrough   involved feeding a system thousands of pictures of cats, until   the program was able to recognize a cat on its own.GoogLeNet AI provides groundbreaking cancer research! Image     source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();Recognizing breast cancer tumorsThis ability to identify patterns has led to a significant   breakthrough in the area of breast cancer research. Last month,   in a paper titledDetecting Cancer Metastases on Gigapixel Pathology     Images,Alphabet Inc.(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) division Google announced that it   had created a neural network that could analyze medical images   and identify tumors with a greater degree of accuracy than human   pathologists. The study revealed that the company, using   its GoogLeNet AI, reviewed thousands of medical images   supplied by a Dutch university and was able to identify malignant   tumors in breast cancer images with an 89% accuracy rate,   compared to 73% for its human counterparts. In ablog, Google researchers explained:Pathologists are responsible for reviewing all the     biological tissues visible on a slide. However, there can be     many slides per patient, each of which is 10+ gigapixels when     digitized at 40X magnification. Imagine having to go through a     thousand 10 megapixel (MP) photos, and having to be responsible     for every pixel. Needless to say, this is a lot of data to     cover, and often time is limited.This technology has the potential to provide initial   screenings, allowing doctors to review only those images that   have been flagged as potentially cancerous. The system still   requires improvement, as it generated a number of false positives   -- identifying cancerous cells where none were present. So, while   AI won't be replacing pathologists anytime soon, these algorithms   could be used to pre-screen images and not only reduce the   workload on doctors, but also serve parts of the world where   pathologists are in short supply.IBM enhances Watson's ability to ""see"" medical images. Image     source: IBM.Watson reads medical imagesGoogle isn't the only one testing AI for this purpose. Nearly   a year ago,International Business Machines Corporation(NYSE: IBM) partnered with numerous health systems, imaging   technology companies, and academic medical centers to trainWatson AI, its cognitive computer, to read medical images. This more   broadly based collaboration is focusing on cancer, cardiovascular   disease, eye health, and diabetes. The company announced last   month that it had expanded that initiative to 24 organizations   worldwide, which will provide the vital input necessary to train   the system. IBM also announced the first fruits of this endeavor,   an application for the detection of one type of cardiovascular   disease involving a narrowing of the heart's aortic valve. It   plans to expand Watson's efforts to a variety of additional   cardiovascular conditions in the near future.Watson is already seeing success in a number ofmedical applications. In its most impressive results in the field to date, Watsonreviewedthe medical records of 1,000 cancer patients and was able to   develop a treatment plan that concurred with oncologists'   recommendations with 99% accuracy. The AI was also able to   provide additional recommendations in about 30% of cases that had   been missed by doctors, thanks to its ability to review   even the most recent medical research.The future of medicineNeither company provides specific information regarding how   these AI-related medical breakthroughs would contribute to the   overall business, and any contribution would represent only a   minuscule part of each company's total revenue at this juncture.   These are still extremely early developments, but they illustrate   the vast potential of AI in the not-too-distant future.These AI algorithms won't be replacing your doctor, but they   might just make them more efficient. AI and its applications to   medicine are still in early days, but I wouldn't be surprised to   hear more groundbreaking announcements in the near future.10 stocks we like better than Alphabet (A       shares)When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock       tip, it can pay to listen.

Big Tech Goes to War Over Toshiba Corp (TOSBF) Flash Memory;4/4/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsLast week, shareholders ofToshiba Corp (USA)(OTCMKTS:TOSBF) voted to approve theseparation of the company's NAND flash memory business, with the intention of attracting outside companies and initiating what amounts to, essentially, an auction of its most valuable asset.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockIn early February,Barron'sreported that Toshiba execs were apparently consideringthe sale of the NAND businessto offset the company's debt. At the time, "" Toshiba's equity [had] dropped to negative $1.7 billion, so it needs to come up with at least that much cash to stay afloat.""That negative equity was the result of a $6.3 billion write-down, which apparently stemmed from""accounting regularities""and ""overstated profits"" of more than $1.2 billion and ultimately led to the resignation of the company's chairman.Initially, Toshiba attempted to auction off a 20% stake in its NAND business, but nothing came of that, likely because ""the serious proposals probably all required the investor to get majority control of the business.""With no alternative options, the proposal to completely sever and sell the flash memory business was put to a vote, with more than two-thirds of shareholders approving the proposal.International Ramifications of Toshiba's NAND Flash MemoryToshiba's NAND flash memory business has been described as the company's crown jewel, and rightly so. In 1984, Toshibainvented flash memoryand in1989 released NAND flash memory chips. Simply put, NAND flash memory is""non-volatile storage technology that does not require power to retain data.""This technology has become the international standard for temporary data storage (i.e., USB thumb drives, MP3 players and other devices where files are frequently overwritten).The 5 Best Stocks to Buy for AprilSince offering a 20% stake in the business didn't yield any viable bids, the company seemingly has no choice but to sell the entire unit. With flash memory being one of the largest pieces of technology found in everything from smartphones to automobiles to modern kitchen appliances, the owner of that business will have immediate influence on the global flash memory market. This thesis is supported by estimates from Nomura, which indicate that""global NAND sales could increase 51.2% year over year to $51 billion in 2017.""The List of Bidders Is HugeAs you can imagine, the number of companies that would love nothing more than to get their hands on Toshiba's NAND business is massive. Companies from across the globe have lined up, with bids coming from private investors, investment funds, other chipmakers, as well as a number of tech behemoths.According toBusiness Insider, there are currentlyabout 10 potential biddersinterested in Toshiba's NAND business, including the Japanese government itself, South Korean chipmakerSK Hynix,Broadcom Ltd(NASDAQ:AVGO),Western Digital Corp(NASDAQ:WDC),Micron Technology, Inc.(NASDAQ:MU),Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL),Amazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) andAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL).Not all of the bids have been made public, but it was reported that Broadcom offered approximately $18 billion, which is""at the high end of the expected range of $13 billion to $18 billion for Toshiba's chip unit.""Acquiring Toshiba's flash memory business will allow the winning bidder to either design and manufacture its own memory chips, or gain influence - and profit - from the existing international ecosystem.For example, Apple would gain the ability to create better memory units with increased storage capacity for future iterations of the iPhone and iPad. GOOGL and AMZN would be able to""reduce their dependence on external chip makers and ensure supply for their own data servers through in-house manufacturing.""Existing chipmakers such as MU would gain ""an immediate impact on pricing,"" as well as increased market share.Click to EnlargeSource: DRAMeXchangeMicron would have a chance to become the sole provider of NAND flash memory to companies such as Western Digital. Further, MU would have significant influence that could threaten WDC's current advantage in the chip market.For Western Digital, however,Market Realistexplains that:""WDC would benefit only if a Japanese company, a financial company, or a customer like Canon, Foxconn, or Apple (AAPL) acquires Toshiba's share. These companies-individually or in a consortium-would be silent partners and provide the necessary funding to build the new fab and maintain the other fabs.""What This Means for InvestorsCurrently, this entire debacle regarding Toshiba and the sale of its NAND flash memory business is difficult to use to any real advantage. This is simply because there's too much still left up in the air, and until a deal is finally announced there's not much to work with.3 Biotech Trades for the Faux Doomsday ScenarioThere is, however, significant potential for volatility and upset in the technology sector, specifically the companies involved in making memory chips, as well as those that rely heavily on those components. That list is massive, and the fallout from the sale of Toshiba's NAND unit has the potential to shake up more than a few existing business relationships.So for shareholders of the major players currently involved in the bidding, the only thing to do is hurry up and wait. But keep an extremely close eye on how this story unfolds, as share prices are likely to change rather quickly - even if those spikes or slumps are short lived and reactionary.As of this writing, Greg Gambone did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace3 Soaring Semiconductor Stocks Still Worth BuyingThe 7 Best Stocks to Buy for an Income-Rich RetirementThe 10 Best Stocks of the S&P 500 in Q1The postBig Tech Goes to War Over Toshiba Corp (TOSBF) Flash Memoryappeared first onInvestorPlace."

2 Top Stocks to Buy in Virtual Reality;4/4/2017;"Virtual reality (VR) may be off to a slow start with   consumers, but investors only need to scratch beneath the surface   to see how many technology companies arealready pushing ahead on VR.The combined augmented reality and virtual reality market is   expected to be worth $13.9 billion this year -- but in just three   years, it's forecast to grow by an order of magnitude reaching   $143.3 billion in 2020, according toIDC. And while much of the focus is on headsets and controllers   right now, it's likely to be software makers and platform   creators that benefit the most.Image source: Oculus.makeArticleAd();""AR and VR headsets get most of the media attention right now,   but the hardware is only as good as the software and services   running on it,"" Tom Mainelli, IDC's program vice president   for devices and AR/VR, said recently.That's why investors would be wise to considerAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) andFacebook(NASDAQ: FB) for their VR potential. Forget that these are among   the biggest players in the broader tech space for a moment, and   focus instead that they are pursuing VR from a different angle   than most of their competitors.Why Alphabet is a top virtual reality stockIgnore Google Cardboard. You can even set aside Google's   latest headset, Daydream View, if you'd like. Instead, think   about hundreds of millions of smartphone users going to a   Google-created platform for nearly all of their VR content.Google launched its VR hub, Daydream, last year, and   while it hasn't taken the smartphone market by storm yet, it   doesn't have to -- at least not yet. This first iteration of   Daydream was just the opening gambit in its long-term strategy to   becometheVR content hub for mobile users.Remember that Alphabet built out its dominance in the   smartphone space not with hardware, but with a platform   (Android); Daydream could ultimately work in the same way.   Already, there are over 100 Daydream VR apps available to   customers, offering everything from gaming to movies, from the   NBA and NFL toThe New York Times,and more.The big opportunity here is that no one else has the same   reach that Alphabet does in the smartphone space. Daydream   could become the gateway that brings more users into VR,   and Alphabet could monetize this advantage in the same way   it does with Android -- through ads and paid apps (about   one-third of the Daydream apps cost money right now).Alphabet is keenly aware of the capacity for software and   services to generate massive revenues, and I think the company's   early focus on mobile VR -- through Daydream -- is an attempt to   get out ahead of all of its competitors.Why Facebook is a top virtual reality stockJust as we did with Alphabet, let's set aside the case for   Facebook's VR hardware --- through the Oculus Rift -- for now.   Instead, focus on the company's long-term view for VR:""This is a good candidate to be the next major computing   platform. It's worthy of a lot of investment over a long   period,"" Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in   a Bloomberginterviewlast year.Zuckerberg admits that VR could take 10 years or longer to   take off, but  his company didn't spend $2 billion on Oculus   solely to sell cool headsets -- Facebook's also using the   hardware to accelerate the development of software and   services.While it's easy to get caught up in the Rift hardware, its   weak sales numbers, and therecent departureof Oculus' founder Palmer Luckey from Facebook, remember that the   social media powerhouse is still at the beginning stages of its   VR push. It first wanted to enter the hardware market to help   spur demand for software. As Zuckerberg noted last year, ""The   next phase is building the next great software experiences.""Long-term investors looking for the top stocks in VR would be   wise to focus on these software plays -- and remember that it's   likely to take awhile for this market to truly come into its   own.10 stocks we like better than FacebookWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Facebook Inc (FB) Is About to Eat Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL) Lunch;4/4/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsI've argued in the past thatFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB)is too cheap, but I can understand why some investors might be cautious, if not bearish, toward Facebook stock.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockFB stock has risen about 700% from all-time lows reached in 2012. And the company now is worth almost as much as Warren Buffett'sBerkshire Hathaway Inc.(NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B) and more thanExxon Mobil Corporation(NYSE:XOM), among many others.But Facebook itself already haswarned that its blistering growth rate should slowin the coming years.At less-than-20-times 2018 consensus per-share earnings plus cash, Facebook stock still looks cheap. Meanwhile,the scandal this weekatAlphabet Inc's(NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) YouTube is another example of what a mess the online advertising industry is. The more the rest of the business struggles, the more obvious the value of the Facebook platform becomes. And that should lead to further upside for FB stock.YouTube, Twitter and Facebook StockGoogle has a problem on its hands with YouTube. Major advertisers - such as the U.K. operations ofMcDonald's Corporation(NYSE:MCD),Starbucks Corporation(NASDAQ:SBUX) andJohnson & Johnson(NYSE:JNJ) - havepulledall non-search advertising.The boycott is estimated to cost Alphabet$750 million to $1 billion in revenue. It seems highly likely that some - if not most - of that spend will make its way to Facebook. Those brands still want to advertise online - and Facebook will be the best option left standing.The 5 Best Stocks to Buy for AprilAfter all,Twitter Inc(NYSE:TWTR) has its own well-documented problems with ""hate speech,"" one reason why ad growth on that platform has stalled out. Facebook content can be controversial from time to time, but FB's controls look stronger.To be sure, Facebook has had some advertiser issues of its own. Late last year, the company disclosed a series of measurement errors, including an overstatement of the so-called ""reach"" of advertising campaigns. But Facebook at least has been on top of its problems - and is fixing them. Twitter and YouTube are playing from behind at the moment.The Online Advertising Ecosystem Is BrokenThe problems at YouTube are just a single example of an online advertising ecosystem that looks increasingly troubled. Twitter by its own admission has had trouble keeping major advertisers and providing consistent ROI. And the Leslie Jones debacle last year, along with consistent efforts to remove bots and battle hate speech, has hurt that platform's reputation.For its part, Google has repeatedly had to change its terms to combat fraud, adware and malware. And beyond the major platforms, there's further worry for advertisers.Criteo SA (ADR)(NASDAQ:CRTO) and privately held SteelHouse hada nasty lawsuitlast year, with each company accusing the other of click fraud and other malfeasance. One estimate suggests that fraud takesabout one-thirdof online ad spending.For major advertisers, in particular, online advertising is becoming a minefield. The content next to which ads are placed can't be trusted. Measurement of campaign ROI is susceptible to error and fraud. Advertisers clearly are paying for bogus traffic - even on mobile.In that context, Facebook - if it can convince advertisers it's conquered its measurement errors - presents a compelling alternative to traditional online advertising spend. And if more issues like the YouTube ad boycott arise - and they will - ad demand should only increase, and that should push Facebook stock higher.Bottom Line on Facebook StockThere are two core risks to Facebook stock. The first is that traffic to the platform will decline, particularly if consumers find new social media outlets. So far, neither Twitter norSnap Inc(NYSE:SNAP) has proven able to peel away much traffic.The second risk is whether advertisers will keep their dollars on the site or take them elsewhere. That risk has been highlighted of late by Facebook's own guidance and by last year's measurement errors.All Hope Is Fading for Sprint Corp (S) StockBut that risk is diminished by the struggles at Facebook's peers, which make FB advertising look more attractive - and more secure - by comparison. And with both risks rather low on a near-term basis, it's hard not to see more upside for FB stock. There's no debt, still-impressive earnings growth, and a multiple not far from that of the broad market as a whole.Indeed, Facebook stock is attractive enough on its own. And if its competitors are going to send more business its way, it's more attractive still.As of this writing, Vince Martin did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace3 Entertainment Stocks to Buy as Summer ApproachesAmazon.com, Inc.

MeetMe Completes If(We) Buyout, Rebrands to The Meet Group;4/4/2017;"MeetMe Inc.MEETrecently announced that it has completed the acquisition of If(we) Inc., the parent company of Tagged and hi5. The company also changed its name from MeetMe to The Meet Group Inc., effective Apr 3, 2017.We note that the acquisition will help MeetMe to expand its global portfolio of branded meeting apps that enable people to connect with one another.Additionally, the acquisition is projected to contribute $9 million as adjusted EBITDA during the first 12 months following the close. Also, it will enable the merged entity to generate nearly $50 million in adjusted EBITDA and $150 million in annualized revenues.Although the announcement fell short of cheering investors, as evident from a decline of 2.55% on Monday, we note that the scrip has considerably outperformed the ZacksInternet - Servicesindustry over the last one year.While the industry gained 7.6%, the stock appreciated a stellar 110.6%, primarily driven by growing adoption of its mobile meeting platform.Our TakeWe note that the mobile meeting and dating app market remains increasingly competitive with the presence of major networking platforms such as Jaumo, OkCupid, Happn and Scruff.However, with MeetMe's acquisition of If(we), the company has leveled out the competition to some extent.Per MeetMe, If(we) had 2.3 million mobile and 5.4 million total monthly active users (MAU) at the end fourth-quarter 2016. The company believes that the acquisition will add 10.4 million mobile app chats per day and 18,000 new registered mobile app users on an average each day.Also, MeetMe completed the acquisition of Skout, a dating app operator during the last reported quarter.

Before You Dismiss Snap Inc (SNAP) Stock, Remember Facebook Inc (FB);4/4/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAdmittedly,Snap Inc(NYSE:SNAP) stock hasn't had a great start to its life as a public company. From a business standpoint, nothing has actually happened yet. There's been no earnings news so far: First-quarter results for Snap stock likely will be reported in late April or early May. The company did add a ""search"" feature to Snapchat, but that's not big news relative to the $27 billion valuation currently assigned to SNAP.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockBut the narrative surrounding Snap stock has been persistently and consistently negative.Analyst downgradesmet the stock almost immediately, leading SNAP to tumble after early post-IPO gains.Complaints about the lack of voting rights afforded Snap stock holders have led to calls that the company's own IPO was the sign of a bubble in thebroad market.Then when analysts from firms that underwrote the SNAP IPO, including Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, giving Buy-equivalent ratings to the stock, there were thepredictable howlsthat major investment firms were unfairly supporting the stock price. Little over a month after the SNAP IPO, it seems downright contrarian - if not unethical - to issue positive commentary on Snap stock.I certainly understand some of the skepticism; with Snap stock trading at ~60x revenue, valuation risk is obvious.FB Opened Much, Much Worse Than SNAPBut investors jumping on the ""bash Snap"" bandwagon, or thinking SNAP is a slam-dunk short, should bear in mind theearly tradingof social media giantFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB):""Facebook Inc shares slid below $29 to a new low on Tuesday as nervous investors fled the company's shares, concerned about the social network's long-term business prospects and an initial offering price that proved too rich …Wall Street has harbored concerns that Facebook, while boasting nearly a billion users worldwide and dominating Internet social-networking, would have difficulty translating its growing presence on smartphones and other mobile devices into revenue.""That quote comes from a Reuters article written May 29, 2012 - just eleven days after the FB IPO. The IPO itself was a mess, too, and widely referred to as something close to a disaster. Indeed,Nasdaq Inc(NASDAQ:NDAQ) wasfined $10 millionfor system failures during FB's first day of trading.7 'Best of the Best' Stocks to Buy for the Second QuarterIt only got worse from there. By September, FB traded below $18, down more than 50% from its IPO price. And it's difficult not to hear echoes of the Snap IPO in Facebook's own coverage at the time. An ""initial offering price that proved too rich"". Snap stock's lack of voting rights compares to the disclosure that FB CEO Mark Zuckerberg would control the companyeven when he died.And FB stock in its first six months of trading had the same feel Snap stock does now. It was ""muppet bait"": a stock that would burn retail investors. The valuation was crazy. There were even calls that the Facebook IPO was the sign of a ""new tech bubble"" - the same as those made now. Of course, FB investors now are singing a very different tune.Facebook Growth Doesn't Make Snap Stock a BuyThat's not to say, at all, that SNAP is a buy simply because Facebook stock is up ~700% from those all-time lows in September 2012. Snap stock is expensive anda long way from profitability, as my colleague James Brumley has pointed out.But there are two lessons investors interested in SNAP should glean from Facebook's first few months as a public company. The first is that it might be OK to show some patience. Early post-IPO trading is volatile; it's better suited to equity and options traders, not investors. The market is still figuring out fair value for Snap stock, and that takes some time, and a lot of arguments. Lock-up expirations, which allow pre-IPO investors to cash out at designated times, still loom, and could further pressure SNAP.The second lesson, however, is to tune out the noise. The armchair analysts questioning the valuation of Facebook stock, or claiming some sort of bubble, were flat wrong. There was no tech bubble; not only has FB stock soared, but the NASDAQ 100 has better than doubled. Investors who listened to dire, media-baiting, predictions missed out on a lot of value - and not just that created by Facebook stock.Give Snap Stock A ChanceSnap stock might turn out to be a worthwhile investment. It might not. Either way, it is not a sign of the financial apocalypse. The lack of voting rights only makes official what investors in Facebook andAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) already have through their permanent minority voting rights: No control.Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Won't Escape This Storm Anytime SoonThere's little effective difference between Snap stock and Alphabet stock from a governance standpoint. (The same is true among the classes ofUnder Armour Inc(NYSE:UAA, NYSE:UA) stock, which presentsan intriguing arbitrage opportunity.)And yes, Snap stock is expensive, but expensive stocks can stay expensive for a very long time - or grow into their valuations. Just look atAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN). The next time you hear a snap judgment (pun intended) short case for SNAP, remember what theWashington Postwrote about the Google IPOin 2004:""This price is insane. And anyone buying Google as a long-term investment at $109.40 will lose money … This has nothing to do with Google as a company … It has to do with math and with limiting factors - fancy language for the old truism that no trees grow to the sky.""Those voices are always out there. Don't listen to them alone. Do your own research, and give Snap stock a chance.As of this writing, Vince Martin did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceThe 10 Best Stocks of the S&P 500 in Q110 Stocks You'd Be Foolish to Buy Right Now3 Entertainment Stocks to Buy as Summer ApproachesThe postBefore You Dismiss Snap Inc (SNAP) Stock, Remember Facebook Inc (FB)appeared first onInvestorPlace."

Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Won’t Escape This Storm Anytime Soon;4/4/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSince the early days ofAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), there has been plenty of controversy. Often it has been about content, such as with copyright infringements. Yet GOOGL stock has usually found ways to deal with the issues.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockBut recently, Alphabet has found itself in another scrape, and this one may prove fairly damaging.It all started in early February, when theTimes of Londonreported that YouTube ads from major brands were associated with videos that involved hate speech, terrorism and violence.What Kind of Trouble Is Alphabet In?The backlash was quick - and GOOGL stock has already taken a hit. Over 250 brands have suspended their ad campaigns on YouTube, including some of the world's largest likeVerizon Communications Inc.(NYSE:VZ),AT&T Inc.(NYSE:T),Wal-Mart Stores Inc(NYSE:WMT) andStarbucks Corporation(NASDAQ:SBUX).While Alphabet has responded with tough talk about taking swift actions, the fact is that the problems continue. On Mar. 24,TheWall Street Journalreported that YouTube was still running ads with major brands that had offensive content.Yet all this is not a one-off. It seems quite likely that GOOGL has been running these kinds of ads for some time.10 Stocks You'd Be Foolish to Buy Right NowWhat's more, the company has recently been involved in other mishaps, such as:GOOGL made certainLGBTQ content""restricted,"" which has caused an uproar in the community.The company terminated one of its most popular YouTube shows, called PewDiePie, because ofallegedanti-Semitic jokes.Googlepulled an advertisingagreement with a YouTube channel called ""Real Women, Real Stories,"" which had interviews with women who talked about sexual harassment and abuse.Now it's certainly understandable that advertisers should be very concerned. They understand that their brands are quite delicate and can easily be tarnished. Also, by paying for the ads, the companies are essentially subsidizing this content!So what does all this mean for GOOGL stock? Well, some analysts have been crunching the numbers. For example, analysts at Nomura Instinet estimate that YouTube will suffer about$750 million in lost revenues.It's true that this is a relatively small amount when compared to Alphabet's annual revenues of $90 billion. Yet the analysis may ultimately be too narrow. Let's face it, brands may get concerned about other ad programs from GOOGL.Besides, rivals likeFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) andSnap Inc(NYSE:SNAP) will certainly act quickly to capitalize on the situation. In fact, even traditional cable networks, such as the Hallmark Channel, can tout their brand-safe content as more attractive alternatives. Keep in mind that the ""upfront"" season has already started, which is when advertisers make decisions for their budgets.Bottom Line on GOOGL StockIn an interview withRecode, Alphabet executive Philipp Schindler noted that the content issues have been blown out of proportion, saying that it involves ""very very very small numbers."" Yet, he is still focused on dealing with it, such as by using third-party audits and AI software.Overall, this kind of corporate-speak is probably not winning points with advertisers - and it could mean further problems with GOOGL stock. Whenever there is a major controversy, it is critical for a company to react quickly and not get into the statistics of the problem. Customers want action.Wells Fargo: Should You Buy WFC Stock? 3 Pros, 3 ConsA notable example of this is what happened to Airbnb a few years ago, when a customer's home got trashed. The company swiftly made major changes, such as providing an insurance guarantee. As a result, the controversy quickly faded away. If anything, it helped to engender much more customer loyalty and confidence.But so far, GOOGL has not taken this kind of proactive stance. Instead, the company has been more defensive - and somehow thinks technology will be the cure.Now, this strategy may still work for Alphabet, but it will probably take time for things to simmer down. And in the meantime, this could mean that there will be a cloud over GOOGL stock, which could result in sluggish returns.Tom Taulli runs the InvestorPlace blogIPO Playbookand is the author of various books, includingTaxes 2017: Saving A Bundle.Follow him on Twitter at@ttaulli.

Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights: Verizon Communications, AT&T, Alphabet, Sprint and T-Mobile US;4/4/2017;"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL - April 04, 2017 - Today, Zacks Equity Research discusses the Industry: Telecom, Part 1, includingVerizon Communications Inc.(NYSE:VZ-Free Report),AT&T Inc.(NYSE:T-Free Report),Alphabet Inc.(NASDAQ:GOOGL-Free Report),Sprint Corp.(NYSE:S-Free Report) andT-Mobile US Inc.(NASDAQ:TMUS-Free Report).Industry: Telecom, Part 1Link:https://www.zacks.com/commentary/108625/us-telecommunications-industry-outlook---april-2017The U.S. telecommunications industry is currently balanced with almost equal proportions of positive and negative influences. Ever since Donald Trump's presidential victory, the stock prices of most of the major telecom stocks have enjoyed a bullish run in the market through the end of the first quarter of 2017.In a nutshell, the primary reasons behind this bull run were, firstly, the new-look U.S. telecom regulatory body - Federal Communications Commission (FCC) - has given enough indications that It will be less stringent compared with the Obama administration and is likely to roll back several stringent regulations of the previous regime. Secondly, the less restrictive nature of the FCC will aid mergers and acquisitions which will likely spur growth in 2017. Thirdly, expected corporate tax reform will benefit telecom operators.However, several near-term headwinds continue to persist in the telecom industry. The chief ones include growing price competition for wireless services are likely to reduce carriers' revenue growth in 2017. Leading cable MSOs (multi-service operators) have decided to enter the wireless field in 2017 which is likely to intensify competition in an already saturated market.Further, capital spending by the U.S. telecom carriers may be muted in 2017. The 4G LTE wireless penetration is currently 83% in North America. This can primarily be attributed to most carriers' intention to upgrade to 5G wireless network standard which requires massive investment. However, a full-phased 5G network deployment is unlikely before 2020.FCC Under TrumpPresident Trump already has had quite an impact on telecom policy parameters. On Jan 2017, Trump elected existing Republican commissioner Ajit Pai as the new Chairman of the FCC. Ajit Pai is a staunch opponent of several laws and rules adopted by the FCC under former Chairman Tom Wheeler's regime, including Net Neutrality laws, rules to reform business data market and set-top box reform proposals. Notably, all three reform rules were going to hit the telecom operators and ISPs (Internet service providers) the most.Recently, the U.S. Senate and House of Representative voted against a set of privacy rules for broadband service providers, proposed previously by the FCC under the Obama administration. On Oct 2016, the then FCC chairman Tom Wheeler had proposed these rules. However, the new FCC -- reconstructed by Trump with Ajit Pai at its helm -- voted to stay the rules of the previous regime on Mar 1, 2017.What Are Broadband Privacy Rules?The broadband privacy rules proposed by former FCC Chairman Wheeler required ISPs to get consumers' explicit consent before selling or sharing Web browsing data and other private information with advertisers and other companies.Since ISPs have direct access to user database, they used to sell the data to digital marketing firms for targeted advertising. This was a major source of revenues for the ISPs.It is important to note that ISPs likeVerizon Communications Inc.(NYSE:VZ-Free Report) andAT&T Inc.(NYSE:T-Free Report) are governed by FCC rules. On the other hand, Internet firms such asAlphabet Inc.(NASDAQ:GOOGL-Free Report) come under the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) regulations. At present, there are no rules governing data disclosure by Internet firms.As a result, the 'Opt In' ruling will be an advantage. However, the FCC had assured the ISPs that it will try to harmonize the regulations with the FTC. Notably, all the stocks mentioned above currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy)   stocks here.ISPs to Cheer NowThe digital advertisement market space is growing exponentially and ISPs have been increasingly investing resources to cash in on the bountiful opportunities. However, the FCC's previous directive stipulated that the ISP should notify customers before sharing any user data for advertising. This was certainly going to mar ISPs prospects in the business. Consequently, a new FCC body exercising lesser restrictions certainly augurs well for the ISP industry.Key Attributes for 2017(1) The telecommunications industry is essentially characterized by high barriers to entry. The deployment of network infrastructure requires significant capital expenditure, which very few entities can afford. Furthermore, it is not easy for a new telecom carrier to establish itself in the market as it requires government approval to transmit voice, data, and video. Such barriers protect the profits of incumbents.(2) A major characteristic of the telecommunications industry is that it is immune to international geo-political disturbances, even when these lead to economic fluctuations. This is because the need to remain connected stems from our primal instinct to communicate with fellow human beings. Volatility in the global economy due to political and economic disturbance in the Eurozone, Asia-Pacific or the Middle-East has had little impact on the sector.(3) Wireless network strength is the key to future growth of the overall telecom industry. As wireless networks run on radio frequency, spectrums (airwaves) are naturally the most sought after assets in the industry. Spectrum auctions conducted by the FCC from time to time will significantly boost network capacity.(4) Telecom companies offer one of the highest dividend yields in the U.S. economy. Unlike other industries, U.S. telecom operators generate revenues predominantly in the country. This makes these stocks less susceptible to volatility in the foreign exchange rate as well as macro-economic fluctuations plaguing rest of the world. We believe the strong dividend yield momentum will continue as the U.S. economy slowly returns to stability.(5) Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) are not uncommon in the U.S. telecom industry. Telecom and pay-TV operators often join forces to provide better and attractive bundled products to customers. In order to stay ahead of competition, existing players need to be constantly on their toes to introduce innovative products or merge with other companies. In the near future, the U.S. telecom industry is likely to witness further mergers and acquisitions along with product diversifications.Upcoming 5G Wireless TechnologyAccording to a study commissioned by Qualcomm, fifth-generation (5G) wireless technology could result in real global economic growth by $3 trillion cumulatively from 2020 to 2035. Several industry researchers hold that 5G network will provide a download speed of 1 Gbps (gigabit per second), which is 200 times the throughput of the currently available standard 4G LTE network. Latency period of data delivery will be in single milliseconds. Further, 5G technology is designed to be more power efficient than any other standard wireless network available at the moment. Naturally, 5G-enabled mobile devices are likely to last much longer than their 3G or 4G counterparts.In July 2016, in a landmark voting, the FCC unanimously decided to make available high-frequency radio spectrums (above 24 GHz) for the use of the upcoming 5G wireless network. With this, the U.S. becomes the first country in the world to identify and open up a significant amount of spectrum suitable for the ultra-fast 5G mobile standard. At present, all four major national wireless operators, namely, Verizon, AT&T,Sprint Corp.(NYSE:S-Free Report) andT-Mobile US Inc.(NASDAQ:TMUS-Free Report) are conducting trial runs for 5G wireless standards.Valuation Calls for StabilizationGoing by the P/E (price to earnings per share) valuation metrics, which is often used to value telecom sector stocks, the industry looks a bit expensive at this stage. The industry currently has a trailing 12-month P/E ratio of 22.13x, which is higher than the median value of 20.73x in the past year.Additionally, the reading compares unfavorably with the market at large, as the current P/E for the S&P 500 is pegged at 20.31x and the median level is 19.26x. At present, the telecom sector looks overvalued compared to the overall market. This indicates a near-term stabilization for the companies.Another commonly used valuation metrics for this sector is P/S (price to sales) which depicts a similar picture. The industry's current P/S of 3.12x compares unfavorably with the market at large, as the current P/S for the S&P 500 is at 3.08x and the median level is 2.89x.Strong Stocks that Should Be in the NewsMany are little publicized and fly under the Wall Street radar.

Alphabet's Android Topples Windows as Most Preferred OS;4/4/2017;"Per Techcrunch,Alphabet Inc.'sGOOGLAndroid operating system (OS) has dethroned Microsoft'sMSFTWindows as the most popular OS in the world with respect to Internet usage.TechCrunch quoted data provided by StatCounter (a web analytics company) per which Android had a 37.93% market share in the Internet usage space in Mar 2017. This was followed by Microsoft with 37.91% share, Apple'sAAPLiOS at 13.1% and Mac OS at 5.17%.Shares of Alphabet were up 1.06% on Monday. We note that the technology giant outperformed the ZacksInternet - Servicesindustry over the last one year. While the industry gained only 7.6%, Alphabet's shares returned 13%.StatCounter noted that Android's growth was driven by growing demand for smartphones as a means to access the Internet, declining PC shipments and rising demand in Asian countries.We note that Microsoft has dominated the global OS landscape since the 1980s. Given the fact that Android entered the space just five years ago, with a market share of 2.4%, this is a phenomenal achievement. It marks an end to Microsoft's dominance in the OS space.However, as per StatCounter, the Windows OS still commands the lion's share when it comes to desktops and laptops.Our TakeAs per a CiscoCSCOreport, it is estimated that more than half of the world's population will be connected to the Internet by 2020. With PC shipments on a decline, much of this demand will be met by smartphones that enable users to access the Internet on the go.As per an IDC report, the worldwide shipment of smartphones is estimated to reach a whopping 1.9 billion by 2020 at a CAGR of 6%. Given the growth opportunity in smartphones, it is expected that the demand for OS will go up significantly. We believe that Android's dominance is a positive for Alphabet.Moreover, in emerging economies such as India where more than 90% of the smartphones have Android, there is ample scope for the company.On the other hand, although Microsoft is losing ground in the OS space in terms of Internet usage, its in-built search feature, Bing, is proving to be a strong competitor for Alphabet's search engine Google.Zacks RankAt present, Alphabet carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) while Microsoft carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Tuesday’s Vital Data: Bank of America Corp (BAC), Tesla Inc (TSLA) and Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO);4/4/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsU.S. stock futures are pointed lower once again this morning, as Wall Street frets ahead of a meeting later this week between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping. The meeting could be tense, as Trump has labeled China a currency manipulator and, more recently, said the U.S. could go it alone when dealing with North Korea. Elsewhere, economic data today includes reports on U.S. trade deficit and factory orders.makeArticleAd();At last check,Dow Jones Industrial Averagefutures were down 0.25%,S&P 500futures had fallen 0.35% andNasdaq-100futures were lower by 0.41%.On the options front, volume arrived just below average for the past three months, with about 12.7 million calls and 11.3 million puts changing hands yesterday. On the CBOE, the single-session equity put/call volume ratio bounced to 0.67, while the 10-day moving average held at 0.64 for a fourth consecutive session.Driving Monday's options volume,Bank of America Corp(NYSE:BAC) is beginning to see some fraying on the edges of its bullish sentiment outlook, as Vetr and Citigroup both downgraded BAC stock. Elsewhere, call options picked up steam onTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) after the company issued strong first-quarter deliveries, whileCisco Systems, Inc.(NASDAQ:CSCO) drew over-the-top call volume ahead of today's ex-dividend date.Bank of America Corp (BAC)If you were starting to think that BAC stock's rally was long-in-the-tooth, you're not alone. Analysts atVetr downgradedthe shares from ""strong buy"" to ""buy"" yesterday, andCitigroup cut BAC stockto ""neutral"" from ""buy"" bright and early this morning. The bulk of analysts still maintain a positive outlook on BAC stock, however, as Thomson/First Call reports that 24 of the 31 brokerage firms following the shares rate them a ""buy"" or better.The 5 Best Stocks to Buy for AprilOptions traders were not deterred by yesterday's downgrade. BAC saw volume top 743,000 contracts, with calls snapping up 65% of the day's take. What's more, short-term options are also betting on a continued BAC stock rally. Specifically, the April put/call open interest ratio comes in at 0.53, with calls nearly doubling puts among options set to expire this month.BAC has struggled of late, dipping below its 10-day and 50-day moving averages. But April options traders are still betting that the stock will close north of $26 before expiration, as more than 149,000 contracts currently reside at this front-month strike.Tesla Inc (TSLA)Tesla is on track to hit is first-quarter deliveries goals. Over the weekend, the company said it delivered justmore than 25,000 vehicles for the quarter, putting Tesla a little over halfway to its first-half deliveries target of between 47,000 and 50,000 vehicles. Hitting delivery targets will be a major driver for TSLA stock this year, as Tesla ramps up production for the Model 3.TSLA stock jumped more than 7% on the news, pushing Tesla to a record high and eclipsingFord Motor Company(NYSE:F) as the No 2. U.S. automaker in terms of market cap. The news helped spur options volume on the day to more than 616,000 contracts, marking a near-term high in speculative activity. Calls accounted for 57% of the day's take.Despite the boost in confidence, short-term traders remain largely ambivalent toward TSLA stock. For instance, the April put/call OI ratio of 1.16 indicates that puts outnumber calls among short-term options. That said, peak put OI for the series totals 4,875 contracts at the deep out-of-the-money $250 strike, and is mostly likely comprised of protective puts and put sell positions instead of outright bets that TSLA shares will decline.Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO)CSCO stock was flooded with call activity on Friday, and a little digging reveals that the most likely culprit is the fact that the shares are trading ex-dividend today. Shareholders of record as of the close on Monday are eligible for a cash dividend of 29 cents per share payable on April 26.The effect on CSCO's options pits was immediately apparent, as calls made up 94% of the more than 278,000 contracts traded on Monday, with all activity likely geared toward dividend capture strategies.Ulta Beauty Inc (ULTA) Stock Is the Best in RetailUnfortunately for CSCO stockholders, the dividend is likely the only joy they'll see for a while. Cisco had a banner month in February, but the shares have spent the past several weeks fighting for support in the $34 region.That battle now appears to be lost, with CSCO drifting further below $34 with every session. In fact, it may be time to take a look at potentiallyshorting CSCO stock.As of this writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceThe 7 Biggest Land Mines in Your Portfolio Right NowThe 7 Best Stocks to Buy for an Income-Rich RetirementAlphabet Inc (GOOGL) Keeps Getting Smoked by Domino's Pizza, Inc.

Will Verizon (VZ) Bind AOL & Yahoo Assets by an 'Oath'?;4/4/2017;"U.S. telecom behemothVerizon Communications Inc.VZis planning to unite AOL Inc. with Yahoo Inc.'sYHOOcore internet assets under one umbrella - Oath. This was recently reported byBloomberg.Oath is expected to be Verizon's new company overseeing Yahoo and AOL, including more than 20 brands. The company is reluctant to provide any further details on Oath before summer. Reports, however, state that Verizon is pre-estimated to have 1.3 billion users and $7 billion in sales from the combined AOL and Yahoo.AOL Inc. - a major player in the digital content and online advertising space - was acquired by Verizon in Jun 2015. The Verizon-Yahoo deal for $4.83 billion is expected to be completed by the end of the current quarter of this year (by Jun 30). Following the two major irreversible data breaches in the latter half of 2016, this deal underwent a discount revision of $350 million. Under the terms of the deal, Verizon will take control of Yahoo's core assets including its search products, digital content brands, and advertising and analytics assets. The core businesses of Yahoo perfectly complement Verizon's core areas of digital platform.Bottom LineFor quite some time, Verizon is geared up to acquire some major companies in the digital media space. Notably, the company is systematically diversifying its business model into the digital media platform, targeting the lucrative segments of digital media, advertising and content creation as well as distribution.Last September, Verizon teamed up with private media group Hearst Corp. on a number of digital ventures. The company's also launched a segment - ComplexNetworks.com - in a bid to strengthen its digital-video networks. With this service, Verizon is set to pose a formidable challenge to giants like Alphabet Inc.GOOGLand Facebook Inc.FBin the mobile video advertising space.Meanwhile, Verizon Communications is likely to start an online TV streaming service this summer, according to a recent Bloomberg report. The company has decided to come up with dozens of channels nationwide for the new service. Management is currently negotiating with several TV network owners to secure online streaming rights.We believe that the combination of Yahoo and AOL should help Verizon sell more digital advertisements and create a major player in the mobile media and advertising space.Price PerformanceDespite such profitable and booming business prospects, the price performance of Verizon is depressing. Over the past three months, the stock lost 10.01% compared with the Zacks categorizedWireless Nationalindustry's decline of 4.67%.We believe continued operation in the saturated and competitive wireless market, expenses related to promotions and discounts, an intensely competitive video market and persistent losses in access lines (in its wireline segment) might have caused the company's below-par performance.Verizon currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy)   stocks here.Zacks' Best Private Investment IdeasIn addition to the recommendations that are available to the public on our website, how would you like to follow all Zacks' private buys and sells in real time?Our experts cover all kinds of trades… from value to momentum . . . from stocks under $10 to ETF and option moves . . . from stocks that corporate insiders are buying up to companies that are about to report positive earnings surprises.

This Catalyst Can Take NVIDIA to the Cloud;4/3/2017;"The boom in data traffic is creating the need for stronger   cloud infrastructure, forcing cloud service providers (CSPs) to   upgrade their data centers to process the increasing volume and   complexity of data. Gartner estimates that public cloud   infrastructure investments will grow almost 37% this year, to   $34.6 billion, thanks to investments fromAmazon,Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) , andAlphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google to bring their data   centers up to speed.One way to tap this multibillion-dollar market is throughNVIDIA(NASDAQ: NVDA) , as its Tesla graphics processing units (GPUs)   are helping the CSPs bring raw computing power to their data   centers. As it turns out, the chipmaker's data center business   has taken off remarkably in recent quarters, outpacing the growth   in other key segments.Data Source: NVIDIA. Chart by author.makeArticleAd();In fact, the data center business is now NVIDIA's   second-largest revenue source, and it is likely that it will   continue to get bigger given the company's recent moves in this   space.NVIDIA is gaining from GPU adoption in the cloudA huge amount of data is being generated thanks to connected   cars and other Internet of Things devices.IntelCEO Brian Krzanich believes that a single autonomous car could   generate 4,000 gigabytes of data daily if driven for just one   hour, thanks to all the sensors and cameras installed.Machina Research, on the other hand, forecasts that the number of connected   devices will grow over fourfold, to 27 billion, by 2025.This is going to create a big challenge for CSPs in   transferring the data from the cloud to the data center, with   Gartner forecasting that 25% of the data generated will go to   waste even before it is analyzed. NVIDIA, however, has a solution   for the CSPs with its Tesla GPUs that are specifically aimed at   this market.Image source: NVIDIA.The Tesla GPUs accelerate a data center's computing power,   enabling service providers to process huge data sets at a   fraction of the cost required to build a new facility, which   would previously have been required to analyze the same amount of   data. NVIDIA does this by allowing service providers to replace   central processing units with its high-performance GPUs that can   deliver a fivefold boost in computational power and slash costs   by 60%.Not surprisingly, Alphabet has decided to use the chipmaker's   Tesla K80 GPUs on the Google Cloud Platform to offer   deep-learning capabilities to its users. Google Cloud users can   now use up to eight GPUs to perform intensive tasks such as   high-performance data analysis, seismic analysis, and video   transcoding.Google is going to charge $0.70 per hour for each K80 GPU in   the U.S. and $0.77 per hour in Asia and Europe, allowing users to   carry out deep-learning operations without any significant   capital investment. What's more,Tencenthas also decided to use NVIDIA's Tesla P100 and P40 GPU   accelerators to give artificial intelligence (AI) computing   capabilities to its enterprise customers, giving the chipmaker   access to China's booming public cloud-infrastructure market.NVIDIA is targeting AI cloud computingAI cloud computing is fast gaining traction thanks to the   advent of the Internet of Things and connected cars that require   autonomous decision making based on data generated, and NVIDIA   does not want to miss the gravy train. The chipmaker recently   partnered with Microsoft to bring to market a hyperscale GPU   accelerator aimed at AI cloud computing applications.NVIDIA and Microsoft expect their framework -- the HGX-1 -- to   be used in healthcare, self-driving cars, and voice recognition,   among others, as it is positioned as the standard architecture   for AI cloud computing. The HGX-1 is based on an open-source,   modular design, indicating that it is scalable in nature since it   comes with eight Tesla GPUs that can connect to the central   processing unit depending on the workload.NVIDIA has made a smart move by tying up with Microsoft to   develop an AI cloud computing solution as the latter's Azure   cloud service is growing at a faster pace than the market leader.   Amazon Web Services -- the e-commerce giant's cloud computing   services subsidiary -- is currently the market leader in this   space, but Microsoft's Azure cloud could overtake it in a couple   of years according to aMorgan Stanleysurvey.In all, NVIDIA's data center business has a lot of room for   growth as the company's GPUs will play a mission-critical role in   cloud computing thanks to the chipmaker's deep-learning and AI   capabilities. More important, the company is partnering with the   key players to sustain its rapid growth in this space.Find out why Nvidiais one of the 10 best stocks to buy nowMotley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent       more than a decade beating the market.

Pittsburgh Mayor Slams Uber: Will This Affect Its Driverless Car Efforts?;4/3/2017;"Uber hit another bump on the road to driverless car domination as Pittsburgh's mayor pushed back on the ride-sharing startup's autonomy in the city.Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto recently stated his concern that Uber is not pulling its fair share in the agreement to test its self-driving car technology in the city. Peduto believes that Uber should be doing more to give back to Pittsburgh since the city is allowing Uber to conduct driverless car tests that other cities have fought successfully against.""If they are going to be involved in economic disruption, they have a moral obligation to society,"" Mayor Pedutotold theWall Street Journal. ""In a partnership, it's not just what we can do for them.""Uber planted its self-driving seeds in Pittsburghalmost two years agowhen it set up an ""Advanced Technologies Center."" In September 2016, Pittsburgh became the first city in the world to allow self-driving Uber passenger trials. The seven-year-old ride-hailing company is currently testing its driverless car technology in Pittsburgh with human monitors behind the wheel.It is unclear at the moment exactly what Mayor Peduto hopes Uber will do for the city. Nevertheless, a drastic change from Uber seems necessary as the mayor's stance has shifted quickly since the initial September announcement.""It's not our role to throw up regulations or limit companies like Uber,""Peduto told theNew York Timesin September. ""You can either put up red tape or roll out the red carpet. If you want to be a 21st-century laboratory for technology, you put out the carpet.""Uber recently reached a settlement with the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission to end the court battle related to its $11.4 million fine for operating without proper permission. The lawsuit dates back to Uber's early days in the state in 2014, when the company blatantly operated without the proper permits for months. The ride-sharing giant agreed to pay roughly $3.5 million in fines,which marks the largest fine ever assessed by the regulatory body.Uber continues to race towards its ultimate goal of becoming completely driverless, transporting passengers throughout the world without the heavy cost of paying drivers. The company also hopes its move to driverless ride-sharing cars will help reduce traffic accidents and deaths.For now, you can add the company's pressure in Pittsburgh to its growing list of troubles. Uber has faced recent charges of sexism and sexual harassment at its offices. One of its self-driving cars flipped over in Arizona, and a video surfaced showing Uber CEO Travis Kalanick berating and demeaning an Uber driver while he was a passenger.One of the biggest potential controversies Uber faces is a lawsuit from Alphabet Inc.'sGOOGLnew self-driving car company Waymo. The lawsuit accuses Uber of stealing corporate secrets for its own self-driving car development.Head herefor a more in-depth look at Uber's competition, controversy, and the possibility of a 2017 IPO.More Stock News: 8 Companies Verge on Apple-Like   RunDid you miss Apple's 9X stock explosion after they launched their iPhone in 2007?

Microsoft to Shut CodePlex to Focus on Cloud Opportunity;4/3/2017;"Microsoft Corporation'sMSFTvice president for Cloud Developer Services, Brian Harry announced in a blog post that the company will pull the plug on CodePlex, a website for code sharing and project hosting. The move comes in the wake of intensifying competition from GitHub, spam epidemic and a decline in the number of users over the last 30 days.CodePlex has discontinued the creation of new projects on the platform. Moreover, the website will become a read-only platform by October, followed by a complete shutdown on Dec 15, 2017.However, before the shutdown and the decommissioning of the CodePlex platform, Microsoft will take a complete and final backup of the site that will allow users to browse through the published projects.Although shares of Microsoft were up only marginally (+0.23%) on Friday following the announcement, we note that, shares of the company have underperformed the ZacksComputer - Softwareindustry over the last one year. While the industry gained 19.7%, the stock registered growth of 19.0%.The underperformance of the stock could be due to stiff competition in the cloud space and the PC market.However, we expect the stock to rebound in the rest of 2017 given such strategical moves being made from the company's end.Focus Remains on CloudWith Satya Nadella at the helm, Microsoft remains focused on its ""cloud first, mobile first"" motto and the recent announcement is another step in that direction. The CodePlex shutter indicatesMicrosoft's focus on growing its core businesses i.e. cloud and Office 365.We believe that Microsoft's partnership with GitHub allows the company free-up resources previously engaged with the CodePlex.Moreover, many open source codes are now being built to work in the cloud architecture, which could drive the demand for Microsoft's cloud platform Azure.Notably, during the last reported quarter, Microsoft joined the Linux Foundation and announced a new Azure partnership with Open AI which again could drive further adoptions of Azure.As per an IDC report, worldwide spending on public cloud is estimated to reach a whopping $203.4 billion by 2020 at a CAGR of 21.5%. We hope that Microsoft's increasing collaborations with open source providers will help it to become a dominant player in the long run.However, we note that competition is fierce in the cloud space with the presence of other major players such as Amazon'sAMZNAWS, IBM Corp'sIBMIBM Cloud and Alphabet'sGOOGLGoogle Cloud Platform.Zacks RankAt present, Microsoft carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

"Snap (SNAP) Unveils New ""Stories in Search"" Feature";4/3/2017;"Recently, Snap IncSNAProlled out a new 'Stories in Search' feature. This feature now enables a person to search from more than one million Stories posted on the social network.In a blog post, Snapchat said ""Over time, the number of Snaps that were created by our community and added to Our Story simply overwhelmed our curation team-and inspired us to create something new. We've built a new way to understand what's happening in Snaps that are submitted to Our Story, and to create new Stories using advanced machine learning. The results have been amazing: you can search over one million unique Stories on Snapchat!"" At present, the feature has been unveiled in select cities.Snapchat has been curating Stories for its users, whereby they can see ""Snaps from interesting events all around the world - from the field of the Super Bowl to the summit of Mount Everest!""Analysts observe that Snapchat is trying to attract more ad dollars by unveiling the search feature. Ad revenues, like all other social media sites, remain the mainstay of Snapchat's revenues. However, stiff competition from the likes of AlphabetGOOGLand FacebookFB, as well as from smaller rivals like TwitterTWTRin the digital ad market, remains an area of major concern.Snap Inc. PriceSnap Inc. Price|Snap Inc. QuoteIn fact, Facebook outshines Snap in almost all aspects. The company enjoys a first mover advantage in the social media space with over 1.9 billion users from every segment of demography. It has a gargantuan base of over 1 billion DAUs compared with 158 million for Snap. Facebook presents a much larger canvas for advertisers than Snapchat. In fact, Facebook's total addressable market (TAM) has been reported to be 80% bigger than that of Snap.Facebook had recently introduced the ""Stories"" feature - a slideshow of photos and videos that vanishes after 24 hours - to its main platform. Earlier, it had added this blatant rip off of Snapchat's hallmark feature to both Messenger and Instagram. ""Stories"" on Instagram has proved to be a massive hit, with 150 million daily active users.This does not bode well for Snapchat. Analysts have related slowdown in user growth for the social media platform by citing popularity of Instagram stories. As a matter of fact, media reports have quoted Snapchat ""admitting"" that increasing competition from big players like Facebook, which have better resources, is a big threat as they can easily lure users to their platform.Moreover, analysts observed that Facebook can easily take chances by unveiling features that are similar to other social media services. This is because if these ""inspired"" features do not work, it can easily roll them back, like Poke, Slingshot and Bolt previously. After all, platforms like Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger do have their own inherent features that will prevent them from losing users.As a result, at the outset, Snap mostly had a ""Sell"" rating. However, last week, several underwriters assigned the company ""Buy"" ratings, given the monetization opportunities. This move has definitely baffled many, as it goes against the general Wall Street sentiment about Snapchat, i.e, a bearish outlook. There is an obvious hint of prejudice.

Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Keeps Getting Smoked by Domino’s Pizza, Inc. (DPZ);4/3/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBy now it's almost an urban myth, but several months ago a stock chart began making the rounds that showedDomino's Pizza, Inc.(NYSE:DPZ) outperformingAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) since their respective IPOs around the same time in the summer of 2004.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockI first caught wind of this remarkable comparison through atweetby Pension Partners Director of Research Charlie Bilello, an award-winning technical analyst. If anyone's going to get a chart right, it would probably be him.In the 12.5 years since Alphabet and Domino's went public, DPZ stock, at least according to the chart, has delivered a cumulative total return of 2,401% through the middle of January, 846 percentage points greater than GOOGL stock.Unbelievable, right? A tech stock getting thrashed by a pizza stock - it hardly seems possible.To be safe, I checked the Morningstar 10-year total returns for both stocks; you'll find that Domino's has generated an annual total return of 20.3% through Mar. 29, 847 basis points higher than GOOGL.The numbers don't lie.7 'Best of the Best' Stocks to Buy for the Second QuarterHere's why that imbalance isn't going to change anytime soon.GOOGL Stock vs DPZ: Simple MathThe first reason has nothing to do with Alphabet's overall business model and everything to do with the fact momentum is very much on Domino's side.For GOOGL stock to pass DPZ stock on a cumulative basis since their respective IPOs, Domino's stock would either have to flatline for a significant period, while Alphabet keeps chugging higher or Domino's would have to completely collapse, falling back to meet Google's performance, which by most standards isn't too shabby.Unfortunately, it doesn't appear as though Domino's stock is going to cooperate when it comes to flatlining or falling back. Year-to-date, DPZ stock is up 17%, more than 800 basis points clear of Google.The reality is that ever since Domino's introduced a new pizza recipe in late 2009, DPZ stock has been one of the best-performing mid-to-large-cap stocks on the New York orNasdaq Compositestock exchanges.Since January 1, 2010, only three stocks with market caps greater than $1 billion have delivered price appreciation greater than Domino's at2,092%. Of the list of 50 stocks presented by Quartz, GOOGL was nowhere to be found.Pizza's Not Going Out of StyleIt certainly isn't.Last summer I said as muchpickingDomino's as one of three restaurant stocks to avoid the restaurant recession analysts believed was slowly taking hold in the U.S. If you look at the 52-week total return for the restaurant industry versus both theS&P 500and Domino's - 11.7% for restaurants, 17.4% for S&P 500 and 41.7% for DPZ - you'll see that analysts were correct in their assessment.If you're a GOOGL stock owner, you are not going to like the fact that Domino's continues to deliver stellar results. On Mar. 9, Domino'sannouncedQ4 2016 comp sales growth of 13.7% at U.S. company-owned outlets, 12.1% growth for franchise outlets in the U.S. and international same-store sales growth of 4.3%.Oh, and they also opened 1,281 restaurants globally in 2016, while also dominating the competition includingYum Brands, Inc.(NYSE:YUM), which has seen Pizza Hut lose market share to Domino's in recent quarters.Home Depot Inc (HD) Stock Is ... An E-Commerce Play?Domino's has a strong management team with a keen understanding how digital drives its business - 60% of U.S. sales in 2016 were from mobile devices - and that enables it to continue dominating the pizza business.What About GOOGL Stock?Hey, I don't think there's anything wrong with Alphabet stock. I've written several articles in recent months suggesting investors want to own GOOGL stock, including thisonein December where I called it a must-own stock for 2017.I was especially enthusiastic about its stock because of the hiring of Ruth Porat as CFO who's reigned in spending while avoiding choking innovation, the lifeblood of any tech company.InvestorPlace contributor Bret KenwellthinksGOOGL stock is fairly valued at the moment, making it a good time to buy the stock and I tend to agree. It's got a lot of good things going for it; I just don't know if it's enough to keep up with the growth happening at Domino's.If you can afford to buy both stocks, I would. But if you can only buy one, I'd go with Domino's - its growth story is still very much intact.As of this writing, Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 Stocks You'd Be Foolish to Buy Right Now10 Small-Cap Stocks That Could Double in the Next 3 Months7 'Best of the Best' Stocks to Buy for the Second QuarterThe postAlphabet Inc (GOOGL) Keeps Getting Smoked by Domino's Pizza, Inc.

Apple Inc. (AAPL) Will Develop Its Own iPhone Graphics Chip;4/3/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) already designs its own CPUs for the iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch. AAPL licenses the iPhone's PowerVR GPU - graphics processing unit - from British chipmakerImagination Technologies(OTCMKTS:IGNMF).makeArticleAd();Source: AppleDespite the long-term relationship (and Apple owning a stake in the company), AAPL has decided to go it alone on the iPhone graphics chip. Imagination Technologies confirmed the bad news this morning, triggering a panic sell-off that saw the company's shares plummet by over 60%.AAPL's Long Relationship with Imagination TechnologiesApple has been licensing the iPhone GPU from Imagination Technologies since 2008. Its dependence on the company to provide the iPhone graphics chip led Apple to boost its investment in its graphics partner to a 10% stake in 2009.In 2014, it was announced thatApple had signed an extended deal with Imagination Technologies, agreeing to continue using its PowerVR GPUs in iPhones for a multiyear period. As the British chipmaker's largest client, this was a big deal.However, despite the new licensing deal, the relationship between the two companies began to deteriorate. Last year,MacRumorsreported Apple confirmed it hadbeen in talks to acquire Imagination Technologiesoutright, but decided to pass. From there, AAPL began hiring talent from the chipmaker, and was rumored to be establishing a UK office to develop its own iPhone graphics chip.Apple to Design Its Own iPhone Graphics ChipThose rumors became fact this morning when Imagination Technologiesposted a statementon its website confirming Apple's move:""Imagination Technologies Group … has been notified by Apple Inc. (""Apple""), its largest customer, that Apple is of a view that it will no longer use the Group's intellectual property in its new products in 15 months to two years time, and as such will not be eligible for royalty payments under the current license and royalty agreement.""The fallout was immediate, with Imagination Technologies stock dropping over 68% within hours.Designing a new iPhone GPU from scratch will be a challenge - especially without running into IP issues and while using a team with members from AAPL's former long-term partner. Imagination Technologies notes this on its statement, saying: ""Imagination believes that it would be extremely challenging to design a brand new GPU architecture from basics without infringing its intellectual property rights.""However, Apple designs its own A-series CPUs for iOS devices, usingARM Holdingstechnology. Its success on this front shows that AAPL engineers can build customized chips that compete with the best. Ditching PowerVR for its own in-house iPhone graphics chip could give Apple a significant edge over the Android competition using off-the-shelf GPUs.The Apple Effect Can Turn Around and Bite You…As Imagination Technologies is discovering, working with AAPL can be risky. There is potential for huge rewards. But there is also the danger that Apple will decide technology is too important to be left with a third party and bring it in-house. Countless app developers have found this out the hard waywhen iOS gains new features that effectively replaces them.GT Advanced Technologies(OTCMKTS:GTATQ) has seen the dark side of the Apple Effect. That company was tapped by AAPL to manufacture sapphire crystals for future iPhone use. The Apple deal meant a huge ramp-up for mass production. Unable to meet AAPL's demands, rather than celebrate a big payday, the company was forced todeclare bankruptcy in 2014.Trade Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock Before Its Major RallyThe worst-case scenario here for Imagination Technologies is that Apple does go it alone and develops its own in-house iPhone graphics chip. Half of the company's revenue disappears within two years. The most positive read is one that was spiked out on today's statement:""Apple's notification has led Imagination to discuss with Apple potential alternative commercial arrangements for the current license and royalty agreement.""In other words, for Imagination Technologies the best case scenario is renegotiating its deal, convincing Apple to stay be offering more favorable terms.Squeezing its suppliersis another move AAPL is well known for and this movecouldbe just a bargaining tactic. Either way -designing its own iPhone GPU or continuing to use the PowerVR chip for less money- Apple comes out ahead. It always does…As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace7 'Best of the Best' Stocks to Buy for the Second QuarterThe 7 Best Stocks to Buy for an Income-Rich RetirementBlackBerry Ltd (BBRY) Stock Is Being Underestimated by InvestorsThe postApple Inc.

Google Announces Policy Revamp as YouTube Ad Row Escalates;4/3/2017;"The ad controversy that initially appeared to be just a tiny issue, at least toAlphabet Inc.'sGOOGLGoogle, has intensified with a number of companies suspending their advertising on YouTube.Google did give an initial and rather weak explanation at the onset of the crisis stating that the company has policies to debar ads from appearing on pages or videos with offensive or derogatory content. But implementation is not always easy, given the millions of sites in its network.Moreover, 400 hours of video get uploaded to YouTube every minute, which makes the implementation all the more difficult. The company, however, said that it has already initiated a review of the problem.But advertisers did not seem satisfied with the ""half-hearted"" explanation. The issue that primarily centered on the U.K., went global in no time, with over 250 brands suspending their advertising on YouTube. The list includes big names from private as well as public sectors including Transport for London, The FCA, HSBC, Toyota , McDonald'sMCD, Heinz, The guardian, Channel 4, , L'Oreal, Marks & Spencer, Hargreaves Lansdown and Sainsbury's.Google reacted quickly with some ""serious"" announcements. The company posted some notable policy revamps including more fine-tuned advertiser controls, addition of safer defaults, expanded video-level reporting for advertisers and increasing investments to implement its ad policies faster. Google also mentioned its plans to add a significant number of staff and deploy latest artificial intelligence (AI) powered tools to assess dubious content.The stock has lost 1.9% since the issue surfaced three weeks back.Dissatisfied AdvertisersThe withdrawal of ads continues despite Google's proposed amendments. In the last couple of weeks, at least a dozen advertisers pulled their ads on YouTube upon the discovery that their ads were appearing next to YouTube videos that display offensive or controversial content. The list includes big names such as VerizonVZ, AT&TT, Coca-Cola and Wal-Mart.With growing industry pressure, Google is reportedly bringing in stringent quality control measures. Bloomberg reported that the company is launching a new system to enable external partners such as comScore and Integral Ad Science to verify ad quality standards on its video service.According to Alphabet's Chief Business Officer Philipp Schindler, ""We switched to a completely new generation of our latest and greatest machine-learning models."" ""Google has made quick progress on its own. Using the new machine-learning tools, and a lot more people, the company in the last two weeks flagged five times as many videos as ""non-safe,"" or disabled from ads, than before,"" he added.Our TakeGoogle is embroiled in a legal battle across practically all continents and issues like this are likely to add to its woes, at least in the short haul. Apart from being a huge drain on ad revenues, these give it a bad name on quality assurance.Alphabet Inc. Revenue (TTM)Alphabet Inc. Revenue (TTM)|Alphabet Inc. QuoteMoreover, the cost of developing and implementing a proper solution could put pressure on the company's margins. This could be a reason why Google has been ignoring the issue. Hence, developments like these are worth keeping an eye on.However, we believe the issue will not be a long-term threat, given Google's long history of execution, leading search market share and growing focus on innovation, strategic acquisitions and Android. With a huge cash balance and technological prowess, the company has the flexibility to pursue growth in any area that exhibits true potential.Currently, Alphabet has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.More Stock News: 8 Companies Verge on Apple-Like   RunDid you miss Apple's 9X stock explosion after they launched their iPhone in 2007?

Tencent vs. Baidu: Who Will Win the Upcoming Chinese AI War?;4/3/2017;"Tech giantsTencent(NASDAQOTH: TCEHY) andBaidu(NASDAQ: BIDU) are currently engaged in an ongoing O2O   (online-to-offline) ecosystem war in China. Tencent is turning   WeChat -- the most popular messaging app in China -- into an   all-in-one platform for making payments, hailing cabs, playing   games, ordering food, and making online purchases. That   social-centric expansion forced Baidu, which owns the biggest   search engine in China, to add similar services to its mobile   app.Those battles are now moving toward the growing artificial   intelligence market. By adding AI capabilities to their   platforms, Tencent and Baidu can boost the analytics capabilities   of their services and set the foundations for next-gen   initiatives like driverless cars. Let's take a closer look at the   arms race between these two companies, and see if one can   eventually gain the upper hand.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();A look at Tencent's AI investmentsTencent first announced the establishment of its  AI Lab   last April, and 50 AI specialists now work there. Tencent   recently poached the chief of machine learning research at   Baidu's Big Data Lab, Tong Zhang, to lead the unit. Prior to   joining Baidu, Zhang cut his teeth atIBMandYahoo. Zhang will also lead a team of 200 product engineers to convert   AI advances into usable features for Tencent's apps and   services.Tencent wants to apply AI to four key areas -- its content,   social apps, online games, and cloud services. The company notes   that ""over a hundred"" of its products -- including WeChat, QQ,   and the Tian Tian Kuai Bao news app -- already rely on AI. To   strengthen its cloud-based AI processing capabilities, Tencent   installedNVIDIA's(NASDAQ: NVDA) high-end GPUs -- which are  better for   machine learning purposes than CPUs -- in its cloud servers.Image source: Getty Images.Tencent also developed a Go-playing AI to followAlphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google. Google's AlphaGo AI beat   Go world champion Lee Sedol last year. Tencent's Go-playing AI,   Fine Art, recently beat high-ranking Japanese Go player Ryo   Ichiriki.AI scientists believe that Go, which requires players to   surround opponents' pieces with their own, is a better test of   problem solving than chess because it has many more possible   moves.Like Google, Tencent believes that AI, ride hailing apps, EVs,   and driverless cars will eventually converge. That's why it   recently invested inChinese EV makerNIOand bought  a 5% stake inTesla Motors. It might even tap its existing partnership with NVIDIA, which   develops CPUs for connected and driverless cars, to eventually   produce its own driverless platform.A look at Baidu's AI plansBaidu founded its  Big Data Lab in July 2014. The   division focuses on improving its machine learning algorithms,   core search technologies, and big data applications. Its products   include the Siri-like virtual assistant Duer, which was    recently given its own business unit, and predictive   analytics tools for businesses. Like Google, Baidu wants to   process the data it receives from its search, mapping, and cloud   services into useful information for companies and consumers.Baidu is aggressively expanding this unit with investments,   partnerships, government backing, and big hires. Like Tencent,   Baidu invested in NIO during its last funding round. It partnered   with NVIDIA and  HERE Maps to create a cloud-connected   mapping platform for autonomous cars, and plans to launch its own   autonomous cars -- which are being produced by a Chinese   automaker -- by  2018. It also formed the dedicated   Intelligent Driving division for those efforts earlier this   year.Image source: Getty Images.In late February, Baidu obtained approval from the Chinese   government to launch a state-backed engineering laboratory for    deep learning technologies like computer vision, machine   hearing, biometric identification, and human-computer   interactions. It also recently acquired Raven Tech, a   Beijing-based start-up which develops an AI platform for smart   homes.Baidu has hired many top AI researchers to lead these efforts,   but it recently lost two major leaders. In addition to Tong   Zhang's abrupt departure for Tencent, Baidu's chief    scientist Andrew Ng, a former Googler who led the AI group   since 2014, also resigned. Those departures have raised serious   concerns, since Baidu's AI group has grown to around 1,300 people   -- and those employees need experienced leaders.Which company has the upper hand?Tencent and Baidu's AI arms race will likely continue for   years, but I doubt that either company will completely   outmaneuver the other. That's because the battle between Tencent   and Baidu closely mirrors the ongoing clash betweenFacebookand Google -- one company owns the dominant social network,   while the other controls the dominant search engine.Since neither ecosystem will completely consume the other,   there will probably always be people who prefer using Tencent's   WeChat over Baidu's app as all all-in-one platform, and vice   versa. However, investors should keep an eye on how much money   Tencent and Baidu are spending on these AI and O2O efforts, since   both companies have posted rising expenses in recent   quarters.10 stocks we like better than BaiduWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

5 Best Growth Stocks to Own as Core Holdings in Your Portfolio;4/3/2017;"It can be hard for growth investors to decide what stocks to   buy because innovation means that today's winners might not   be tomorrow's winners. Instead of gambling by focusing on the   latest fad, consider building a long-term portfolio that's   anchored byApple Inc.(NASDAQ: AAPL) ,Amazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) ,Celgene(NASDAQ: CELG) ,Facebook(NASDAQ: FB) , andAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL) . All five could have what it takes to sidestep   competitive threats and dominate their markets in the coming   years.Fiercely loyal consumersMounting competition fromSamsungand low-cost device makers in China had some people thinking that   Apple's best days were behind it. However, those predictions   haven't panned out -- especially after Samsung's reputation took   a big blow when it was forced to recall its Note last year   because of defective batteries.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.makeArticleAd();Apple's iPhones, iPads, and Macs remain best-in-class options   for innovation-hungry consumers. Apple's long track record of   advancing technology has inspired impressive loyalty that's   allowed it to build a profit-friendly ecosystem of services, such   as iTunes.After sluggish demand last year, iPhone demand is growing   again, and with product refreshes on tap, there's plenty of   reason to think that billions of Apple devices will provide a   steady source of demand for Apple's app store.Given that Apple has $246 billion in cash on the books, it's   got the firepower to invest in R&D to maintain its lead. And   since it's generating $65 billion in annual cash flow that can   support dividend hikes and buybacks, it's hard to argue that   Apple doesn't deserve a spot as a cornerstone holding in growth   portfolios.Plenty of market share left to conquerThe stacks of Amazon boxes on doorsteps last holiday season   may have you thinking that Amazon is close to tapping out its   market opportunity, but the numbers suggest that there's enough   running room for this company to get much, much bigger.In 2016, Amazon generated $136 billion in sales, up 27% from   2015. While that's a big number, sales would still have to triple   for Amazon to match Wal-Mart's top line last year. According to   the Census Bureau, online sales are increasing at a double-digit   annual pace, but they only represent 8.4% of total retail   sales.AMZN Revenue (Annual)data byYCharts.A bigger and wealthier global population offers plenty of   expansion opportunity for Amazon's core business, but retail   isn't the only reason why Amazon is worth owning in portfolios.   Investments in information technology have allowed it to become   one of the largest providers of cloud-based solutions, and its   Prime service has made it a big source for consumer   entertainment, too. Also, its recent push into virtual assistants   means that its devices are sitting in living rooms nationwide,   and that gives Amazon even more chances to connect with (and   profit from) consumers. The company'sAmazon Go, a checkout-less store prototype, and its AmazonFresh show it's   hoping to shake up the $631 billion grocery retail market soon,   too.Expanding its marketsIt's hard to find a company that's better at innovation than   the biotech giant Celgene. It already markets a slate of   billion-dollar blockbuster drugs, and it's enjoying a steady   stream of revenue and profit growth thanks to R&D   investments, acquisitions, and collaborations.Its Revlimid is the most widely used first- and second-line   therapy in multiple myeloma, and although Revlimid's sales are   already $7 billion per year, R&D programs are expanding its   use, and that has management targeting $8 billion in sales this   year. It also markets the billion-dollar third-line multiple   myeloma drug Pomalyst and the pancreatic cancer drug Abraxane,   which brought in $967 million in sales last year.In 2014, management launched the psoriasis drug Otezla, and   although it's only been on the market a short time, it's already   selling at a $1.2 billion clip. Otezla sales could increase to   $1.7 billion or more this year. The company may also launch its   first multiple sclerosis drug soon. It acquired ozanimod in 2015   when it bought Receptos for $7 billion, and following late-stage   trial results that arguably position it as a best-in-class   therapy, management plans to file for FDA approval soon. If   approved, this could be yet another blockbuster drug for the   company because the MS treatment market is worth $19 billion   annually, and it's growing.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Celgene may also get an FDA OK to begin marketing a new   leukemia drug later this year. Celgene   co-developed enasidenib with up-and-comerAgios Pharmaceuticals, and a regulatory nod could come within the next few months,   giving Celgene yet another intriguing source of growth.With a stable of top sellers already and the chance for new   drugs to hit the market in the coming year, this is one of my   favorite growth stock picks for long-term portfolios.Cashing in on communityCompanies like Snap are attempting to challenge Facebook's   dominance as the social media platform of choice, but these   competitors will struggle to match Facebook's global reach.Facebook's nearly 2 billion monthly active users are engaging   in more meaningful communications with one another than ever   before, and tapping into those engagements is providing Facebook   with significant revenue and margin expansion opportunities.In 2016, Facebook's revenue surged 54% to $27.6 billion, and   its revenue per monthly user jumped 34% to $15.98. The ability to   deliver more meaningful advertising to users and to leverage ad   revenue across its fixed costs allowed Facebook's operating   margin to expand 10% to 45%, and that translated into a 177%   spike in net income to $10.2 billion.Those are some eye-popping growth numbers, but what's even   more impressive is that this could still be early days in   Facebook's growth opportunity. Facebook's CEO Mark Zuckerberg   thinks the company could have 5 billion active users someday, and   as it moves toward that user goal, its investments in messaging,   video, and devices could generate significant upside for   investors over the next few years. For example, its messenger and   WhatsApp services boast 1 billion and 1.2 billion monthly active   users, respectively, and demand for those services continues to   increase. Instagram continues to add advertisers, too.Also exciting is Facebook's secretive Building 8 project   that'sworking on next-generation hardwaresolutions. Building 8 hasn't announced any specific products yet,   but it's only a matter of time before consumers get more insight   into how Facebook plans to compete in consumer electronics.Building better mousetrapsEyeball-friendly simplicity has allowed Alphabet's Google to   dominate search for more than a decade, and Alphabet is using its   mountainous data to maintain an edge in helping people find and   leverage content in increasingly helpful and informative   ways.Alphabet changed its name from Google a few years ago to   better reflect its commitment to expanding beyond search, and   that commitment has turned it into a leader in powering mobile   consumer electronics hardware with Android. Approximately 85% of   all the world's smartphones sold run on Android.Last year, Alphabet's full-year revenue increased 20% to   $89.5 billion, its free cash flow increased 55%, and its earnings   per share increased 22%.

Himax Technologies History: Everything Investors Need to Know;4/2/2017;"Himax Technologies(NASDAQ: HIMX) has been publicly traded since 2006, and since   then thefabless semiconductor companyhas experienced a few massive stock price run-ups and a few   substantial drops as well. Investors who bought Himax right   when the company went public have seen their investment gain just   over 4%.To find out how the company might perform in the near future   let's take a quick look at what's caused Himax's stock to pop --   and dip -- and if the company is likely to experience more of the   same going forward.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();Himax's share price historyAs you can see from the chart below, Himax's share price   history has been on a wild ride since mid-2013, after   experiencing a slow decline following its IPO.Himax's stock price began skyrocketing in 2013 on news thatAlphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google was implementing some of   Himax's technology into its ill-fated Google Glass device. Google   even took a 6.3% stake in the company at the time, with the   option of grabbing 14.8% of Himax if wanted it -- which Google   eventually decided against .Image source:YCharts.During that time the company's stock hit an all-time high,   only to plummet after things with Google and its Glass device   didn't pan out.Then, near the beginning of 2016, investors started getting   excited about Himax's prospects in the AR space again, this time   on hopes thatMicrosoft's(NASDAQ: MSFT) Hololens would bring Himax's share price huge   gains. Unfortunately, the company faced a similar situation as in   the past when the Hololens failed to bring huge gains for Himax.   Investors began dumping the stock after a few analysts cut their   buy ratings on news that Hololens shipments were lower than   expected.Looking aheadMuch of Himax's prospects are being built around the company's   ability to supply technology for its AR customers. On Himax's   recent earning call, CEO Jordan Wu said that,Having invested in related technologies for over 15 years,     we are uniquely positioned as the provider of choice for micro     display and related optics, both of which [are] critical     enablers to AR devices.The company is ramping up for more sales of its liquid   crystals on silicon (LCOS) and wafer-level optics (WLO)   products for AR devices after ramping up production for both   later this year and into 2018.Himax says that the ramp-up is because its AR customers are   looking to their next generation devices, and that Himax's tech   will benefit from that. While this certainly could be true, it   also feels a little like 2013 all over again. Betting on AR --   which is still an unproven market -- could take a long time to   pay off for the company.Northland Capital Markets' Tom Sepenzis wrote in a recent   investor note (republishedon Barron's):Augmented reality remains the largest potential for HIMX     with its LCOS and WLO products, but the market has hit another     stumbling block as prices remain prohibitive for consumers. We     believe that this will limit the number of new AR devices for     the next 12-24 months....AR is expected to be worth $117 billion by 2022, according to   Markets and Markets research. Investors can look to Himax's past   share price volatility and see that betting on this stock's AR   future can turn out badly. A better approach may be to wait a   little while longer and see if Himax's technology investments   bare some fruit later this year and next, and then see how well   that positions the company in the AR space.Right now, investing in Himax looks like a bet on both its   unproven prospects in ARandthat the augmented reality market will grow quickly. Himax's   history has shown that investors can easily get caught up in the   stock's future potential, while disregarding the hurdles the   company faces.10 stocks we like better than Himax     TechnologiesWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

After Souq.com Purchase, Will Amazon Ever Be Profitable Abroad?;4/2/2017;"Amazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) dove into the Middle Eastern market for the first   time ever this week.The e-commerce giant said it would acquire Souq.com, the   largest online platform in the Arab world with 8.4 million unique   products for sale and operations in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab   Emirates, and Egypt.Terms of the deal were not disclosed, thoughTechCrunchreported the price tag at $650 million, below the $1 billion   Souq.com was valued at in its last funding round. Amazon   said it expected the deal to close by the end of the year.makeArticleAd();Souq.com CEO Ronaldo Mouchawar. Image source: Souq.comSouq is the latest in a long history of mostly successful   acquisitions for Amazon. Among the other online retailers Amazon   has taken over are the popular shoe seller Zappos and   Diapers.com-parent Quidsi, where Amazon just announced it was   laying off hundreds of employees. Another notable move was the   company's purchase of Kiva Systems, which makes robots that move   shelves and has helped boost efficiency in its warehouses.While Amazon's acquisition strategy has helped consolidate its   lead in e-commerce and drive growth in other areas like cloud   computing, video streaming, and audio books, the company's   results in international markets have been less impressive.In 2016, Amazon post an operating loss of nearly $1.3 billion   outside North America, and that loss nearly doubled from the year   before. At $44 billion in revenue, Amazon's international   segment is about half the size of its North American division.   Over the last three years, international growth has also   significantly lagged growth in its home market, even when the   effects of a stronger dollar are stripped out. During those   three years, Amazon has also suffered a total operating loss   abroad of more than $2.6 billion.Amazon has been operating outside North America for nearly 20   years, but even for a company whose mantra is ""long-term,""   investors would be remiss if they didn't question whether the   company's international segment will ever generate profits.A tough nut to crackWhile plenty of American companies have found success and   billions in profits abroad, including tech giants likeAppleandAlphabet, it's been tougher going for retailers.Targetrecently abandoned its Canadian operations; several retailers,   includingHome Depot,have pulled out of China, and evenWal-Mart(NYSE: WMT) , with subsidiaries in major international markets   like the UK, China, Brazil, and Mexico, has struggled at times to   replicate its success at home as operating margins are thinner   outside the US. About a quarter of Wal-Mart's revenue comes from   abroad.For retailers, entering foreign markets means massive   investments in real estate and supply chain infrastructure. Even   an e-commerce company like Amazon still needs a network of   fulfillment centers to serve its overseas customers. It has over   100 such warehouses in the US, which have allowed it to offer   services like Prime Now and Amazon Fresh, but matching that   density abroad won't be easy. The company's competitive advantage   often lies in the fast delivery that its Prime membership program   offers, which helps explain why it's profitable in North America   but not internationally.Amazon has stepped up its focus on foreign markets. After   losing out toAlibabain China, the company has pledged $5 billion in investments in   India, challenging local companies like Flipkart and Snapdeal, as   well as Alibaba. It also recently made Prime Video global,   offering rock-bottom prices in markets like India and   undercuttingNetflixin the process. However, in the vast majority of those countries   where its video streaming service is now offered, the two-day   delivery that Americans associate with Prime is not available.Will the Souq deal pay off?Buying the biggest e-commerce company in the Middle East seems   like a smart move, and will certainly accelerate Amazon's growth   in that corner of the world. But investors need to be mindful   that Amazon is in a much earlier stage of development abroad than   it is in the US. The company is still making investments to drive   growth, and seems less concerned with profits. While Prime has   reached a penetration rate of about 50% of US households, that   rate is much lower overseas.It's unclear at this point if Amazon will ever be consistently   profitable in the international segment. A weaker dollar would   help, but the company also faces a number of challenges unique to   the international market including infrastructure, different   cultures and regulations, and local competition.With Souq joining its portfolio, expect Amazon's international   revenue growth to continue, but profits will likely remain absent   for the foreseeable future, as the company's scale overseas is   still far from what it is at home.10 stocks we like better than AmazonWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

In Your 40s? 3 Stocks You Might Want to Buy;4/1/2017;"What will the world look like 20 to 25 years from now?That's the question that investors in their forties should   think about when considering which stocks to buy now. While even   the best prognosticators can't know for sure what the future   holds, three stocks seem to be pretty good bets to survive and   thrive in the decades ahead. If you're in your forties, here's   why Google's parentAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) ,Illumina(NASDAQ: ILMN) , andTeladoc(NYSE: TDOC) could be stocks to consider.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();Alphabet: Artificial intelligence, robots, virtual reality,   and moreAlphabet is about a lot more than just its enormously   successful Google search engine. The company claims a leadership   role in many of the most important technologies for the future,   including artificial intelligence, robotics, and virtual   reality.Artificial intelligence (AI) could change how we drive, work,   and nearly every other aspect of our lives over the next 25   years. AI has been a top priority for Alphabet for quite a while.   However, the technology giant has beefed up its capabilities   significantly in recent years through acquisitions. Alphabet   bought 11 AI companies over the last five years, according to   market-intelligence provider CB Insights. Most notably, Alphabet   scooped up hot British AI pioneer DeepMind in 2014.On a related note, there have been quite a few news stories   lately about how robots could replace human workers in the near   future. Alphabet is a leader in the robotics field also. The   company owns Boston Dynamics, which in 2016 announced the   development of its Atlas robot. Atlas was so impressive that it   prompted internet entrepreneur and angel investor Jason Calacanis   to state that the robot ""is really the end of manual labor.""Virtual reality is another technology poised to radically   change how we live in the next few decades. Alphabet is a major   player in this area, also. It markets the Daydream View virtual   reality headset made with soft, breathable fabric that is   comfortable to wear.The bottom line is that Alphabet appears to be in great   position to be a leader in multiple technologies that could shape   the future. And with a huge cash stockpile, the company will   likely continue making strategic acquisitions that improve its   leadership position.Illumina: Making the DNA revolution possibleA different kind of technology has already begun   revolutionizing medicine and seems highly likely to continue   doing so. Analyzing DNA and mapping the human genome has led to   significant medical breakthroughs and the development of powerful   drugs. One company largely responsible for making this DNA   revolution possible is Illumina.Illumina is the global leader in sequencing and   array-based solutions for genetic analysis. The company's   HiSeq X genomic sequencing system technology announced in 2010   paved the way for mapping human genomes for roughly $1,000, a   milestone in the DNA revolution.Another major milestone could be just around the corner. In   January, Illumina announced its newest system, NovaSeq. Illumina   believes that the NovaSeq architecture will enable a human genome   to be mapped for $100. Such a dramatic reduction in cost should   fuel the growth of precision medicine, an approach for treating   disease that matches drugs with individuals' genetic   profiles.The impact of what Illumina's technology could usher in isn't   easy to fully grasp. Diseases for which no treatment is currently   available could be treated and potentially even cured. Others   will find the ""gold"", but Illumina will likely continue to be the   leading provider of genetic ""shovels.""Teladoc: Bringing healthcare to your homeDo you hate going to the doctor? Teladoc is a leader in   bringing the doctor to you -- virtually.The company provides on-demand healthcare services   remotely to patients through mobile devices, internet, and phone.   Teladoc commands an impressive 75% market share in the telehealth   industry. That's three times larger than its nearest   competitor.Teladoc estimates a total U.S. market opportunity for   telehealth of more than $29 billion. Too optimistic? Not if you   consider that around one-third of all outpatient medical care is   treatable through telehealth and four-fifths of behavioral health   visits could be done remotely.Although the majority of Americans still haven't used   telehealth, the numbers are growing.A recent survey showsthat most of those who haven't received healthcare virtually are   interested in doing so.While several companies have jumped into the telehealth space,   Teladoc is leading the way. The company has over 7,500 customers,   including more than 220 of theFortune1000 companies.10 stocks we like better than Alphabet (A     shares)When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Will This Overlooked Cloud Stock Grow 60% by 2018?;4/1/2017;"Shares of cloud storage providerBox(NYSE: BOX) rallied 35% over the past 12 months, but the stock   hovers just 18% above its IPO price of $14. That's because after   hitting $23 on its first trading day in Jan. 2015, Box plunged   below $10 last February before gradually recovering to the   mid-teens.Despite that lackluster performance, Drexel Hamilton analyst   Brian White recently reiterated his ""Buy"" rating on the stock and   his price target of $26 -- which  represents a near-60%   rally from its current price. White claims that Box looks cheap   with an EV/Sales ratio of 3.3 based on its calendar 2018 (fiscal   2019) expectations. Is that ""low"" valuation enough to justify   buying Box, or should investors ignore this overlooked cloud   stock?Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();What are Box's key strengths?Box provides cloud storage and associated services to over   71,000 businesses, including the majority of the Fortune 500   companies. Its major customers include industrial behemothGeneral Electricand  pharmaceutical giantAstraZeneca. That market presence is impressive, since the cloud storage   market is filled with bigger players likeAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN),Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT), andAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) 's Google.Despite those challenges, Box has posted double-digit sales   growth ever since its IPO. Its revenue rose  32% to $398.6   million in fiscal 2017, and it expects another 25%-26% growth   this year. Much of that growth comes from the addition of new   customers, the introduction of add-on cloud services (like   security and analytics) which boost its revenue per customer, and   integration partnerships with companies like Microsoft,Salesforce, andIBM. Deferred revenue, a key indicator of forward demand, rose 30%   to $242 million at the end of fiscal 2017.What are Box's key weaknesses?Like many high-growth tech companies, Box's robust revenue   growth doesn't trickle down to any profits. However, its non-GAAP   loss narrowed from $1.16 per share in 2016 to $0.56. During that   period, its GAAP loss narrowed from $1.67 to $1.19. That GAAP   loss was heavily weighed down by stock-based compensation   expenses, which gobbled up 20% of Box's revenues during the   year.Wall Street expects Box to report non-GAAP losses this yearandnext year -- although those losses are expected to continue   narrowing. Box faces a dilemma which many cloud SaaS (software as   a service) companies face -- competition keeps price expectations   low, but the cost of securing new customers and developing new   services remains high. We can clearly see that impact in its   operating margins:Source:YChartsThe ongoing cloud storage pricing war  between Amazon,   Microsoft, and Google limits Box's ability to raise prices.   However, all three companies can afford to use cloud storage   services as a loss leader to expand their ecosystems. Box has   neither the scale nor ecosystem to follow suit -- so it could   eventually lose customers to those tech giants' bundling   strategies.Box finished 2017 with a negative free cash flow (FCF) of   $24.8 million. That marked a big improvement from its negative   FCF of $116.3 million in 2016, and Box achieved its first quarter   of positive free cash flow ($10.2 million) during the fourth   quarter. However, Box isn't expected to achieve a full-year   positive FCF anytime soon, and a negative FCF could prevent Box   from scaling up to widen its moat against bigger challengers.What do the valuations say?Drexel Hamilton's bullish view on Box is based on the notion   that an EV/Sales ratio of 3.3 is cheap for a company with its   growth figures. For example, two other high-growth cloud service   stocks withcomparable sales growth--TwilioandVeeva-- have respective EV/Sales ratios of 4.6 and 8.2 based on   next year's projected revenues. It's also lower than the current   industry average of 4.8 for application software makers.Assuming that Box is ""fairly valued"" with an EV/Sales ratio   between Twilio and Veeva's, it's certainlypossiblethat Box could rise to White's price target of $26. However, what   bothers me about that estimate is that it's based on a long-range   forecast, and a lot can change in the cloud storage industry   within two years. If Amazon, Microsoft, and Google continue   slashing prices and piling on more features, Box could struggle   to retain its top customers.The key takeawayI think Box has solid sales growth, and its growing list of   big enterprise customers indicate that it has a lot of staying   power. It also did a great job at adding more services and   partnerships, narrowing its losses, and achieving positive free   cash flow last quarter.However, claiming Box can rise 60% based on next year's sales   estimates is a bit too optimistic. It's hard to tell how much   storage prices will fall over the following year, and Box CEO   Aaron Levie even once admitted that  cloud storage would   likely be ""free and infinite"" in the future. Therefore, investors   should temper their expectations for Box based on future   developments across the cloud market.10 stocks we like better than BoxWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

The King of Beers Joins the Renewable Energy Bandwagon;4/1/2017;"As politicians and interest groups debate the future of   climate change policies and renewable energy mandates across the   country, a big power in the world of energy is making its   strategy well-known. The business community has made a big   commitment to transform their businesses to renewable energy,   which is now driving wind and solar investment around the   world.The latest to make a 100% renewable electricity commitment isAnheuser-Busch InBev(NYSE: BUD) , the world's biggest beer maker, which said on   Monday that it will make the transition by 2025. Make no mistake,   AB-InBev isn't suddenly an environmentally focused company.   They're making an economic decision to buy renewable energy. It's   a trend the corporate world is taking very seriously.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();AB-InBev's renewable playBelow is the infographic AB-InBev used to announce its   renewable energy commitment. It highlights the move from 7%   renewable energy to 100% by 2025 and shines a light on Mexico as   a focus.Image source: AB-InBev.The Mexico announcement is interesting because the country   held two renewable energy auctions in 2016 that got very   favorable terms. A year ago, bids were announced at 5.07 cents   per kilowatt-hour (kWh) of electricity and by October bids   averaged 3.35 cents per kWh for clean energy. This compares to   average retail electricity prices of about 12 cents per kWh, so   renewable energy is very economical for big companies.And these projects will be completed by the end of the decade,   so the price AB-InBev will pay by 2025 will be lower than the   contracts signed in 2016. In total, the announcement says some 6   terawatt-hours, or around 3 gigawatts (GW) of solar, will produce   energy for AB-InBev.Corporate America loves renewable energyAB-InBev isn't the first company to take interest in renewable   energy. In the U.S.,Target(NYSE: TGT) andWal-Mart(NYSE: WMT) are the two biggest corporate solar users, with 147.5   MW and 145.0 MW, respectively, according toSEIA's Solar Means Business 2016 report.Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) says it has been100% powered by renewable energy since 2014andAlphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google says it willreach that level in 2017.Companies aren't just looking at renewable energy as a PR   move; they're looking at it as a way to save money. Target   and Wal-Mart are primarily installing solar directly on their   rooftops, reducing electricity bills from the utility. And data   centers byApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) , Microsoft, and Alphabet are now installing   renewable energy nearby so they can use renewable energy   directly. Apple has co-located nearly 100 MW of solar at data   centers in North Carolina and Nevada with another 100 MW in   development. Microsoft recently signed a deal to buy energy from   237 MW of wind farms in Wyoming and Kansas to power a Wyoming   data center. Alphabet has invested $2.5 billion in renewable   energy projects to power its business. This is becoming big   business for wind and solar companies.Corporate buys are the new renewable driverFor over a decade, renewable energy has been driven by   mandates and subsidies around the world, and in many places, it   still is today. But costs have come down so far that corporations   are now looking at it as a way to save money on their operations   long-term. And that'll only drive more wind and solar   installations as more companies join the renewable energy   bandwagon.10 stocks we like better than Anheuser-Busch InBev     NVWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

This Top Stock Mutual Fund Cheers Retirement Investors With Gains;3/31/2017;"A tail wind has kicked up this calendar year behind $7.5   billion American Century Growth Fund (TWCGX). That's nice news for investors holding the fund inretirement accountsand other portfolios. The fund's 9.93% gain this year going   into Thursday topped 73% of the fund's large-cap growth rivals   tracked by Morningstar Inc. That's a step up from the 67% of   peers the fund outperformed over the trailing 12 months with a   16.40% return.Managers Gregory Woodhams and Justin Brown pick stocks   individually and not based on sectors, but their sector weights   show where they expect to find leaders. Technology was their top   sector as of Jan. 31, with a 34% weighting. Consumer   discretionary was next with 20%.Tech titansAlphabet(GOOGL),Apple(AAPL) andMicrosoft(MSFT) - the fund's first, third and fifth largest holdings   - illustrate that appetite. Alphabet is up 7% so far this   year. Apple is up 24%. Microsoft is up 5%.

One of those wasCitizens Financial(CFG), a top new buy whose EPS growth has accelerated for three   quarters in a row.Still, the stock is down 3% this year after tumbling 13%   off its March 1 high. That pullback along with the broad market   reflects investors' concerns that Congress' failure to revise or   kill ObamaCare is a sign that additional Trump initiatives, such   as corporate and individual tax cuts and lighter regulatory   burdens for banks, may not be as likely as investors had   hoped.Shares ofCitrix Systems(CTXS), yet another newcomer to the portfolio, surged March 13 on   rumors of a company sale. The company's business   software creates work spaces that provide access to   desktops, apps, data and communications on any device, over   networks and in the cloud.As IBD recently reported,Citrix has been pressured by activist   investor Elliott Management to make changes. On Feb. 1, Citrix completed its spinoff of its GoToMeeting   business, which then merged withLogMeIn(LOGM).GoToMeeting is a conferencing application that allows remote   access to personal computers.Citrix shares are up 20% this year. The cloud computing   company's most recent EPS report was for Q4, in January.   It earned $1.61 a share on sales of $908 million. That   topped consensus for EPS of $1.50 and revenue of $900.8 million.   But the $1.61 was a decline of 3%.The company forecast 2017 EPS of $4.60-$4.65 and revenue of   $2.81 billion to $2.84 billion. Both are well below consensus for   $5.60 EPS and sales of $3.55 billion, but Citrix's guidance   excludes GoToMeeting.VMware(VMW) is another new buy for the fund. The server virtualization   leader is up 17% this year. EPS grew 0%, 4%, 12% and 13% the past   four quarters.VMware paid $1.3 billion to buy Niciria, a software-defined   networking company, three years ago. VMware said recently it   expects $1 billion in sales of NSX, made possible by that   acquisition. NSX lets companies update networks through software   changes rather than the more costly path of replacing routers and   switching hardware.NSX is a challenge toCisco Systems'(CSCO) flagship networking software product, called Application   Centric Infrastructure (ACI).In the consumer discretionary sector, bellwetherAmazon(AMZN) and auto-parts chainO'Reilly Automotive(ORLY) were the fund's second- and seventh-largest holdings as of   Jan. 31.Amazon has been trending mostly sideways since mid-February,   hanging on to a 17% gain so far this year.O'Reilly is down 1% this year.RELATED:IBD's Best Mutual Funds 2017 Awards: New Crop     Of WinnersFacebook, Alphabet Among Hot Tech Stocks     American Century Growth Mutual Fund Likes"

The deal with Giuliani Partners to combat cyber threats is encouraging. Also, we are optimistic on the agreement with Indian telecom enterprise, Optiemus Infracom Ltd.BlackBerry signed another contract with Chinese handset manufacturer, TCL Communications, to produce BlackBerry handsets for certain countries globally. This move came on the back of an enhanced focus on software and licensing service amid increasing competition from peers such as Apple Inc.AAPLand Nokia Inc.NOK. Moreover, the company's launch of DTEK60, manufactured by TCL and running on the Alphabet Inc.GOOGLAndroid platform, is a positive.We also note that BlackBerry's decision to discontinue with internal hardware development and focus exclusively on its software manufacturing business is a prudent one. This is because declining smartphone sales had been hurting the company for quite some time.Zacks' Best Private Investment IdeasIn addition to the recommendations that are available to the public on our website, how would you like to follow all Zacks' private buys and sells in real time?Our experts cover all kinds of trades… from value to momentum . . . from stocks under $10 to ETF and option moves . . . from stocks that corporate insiders are buying up to companies that are about to report positive earnings surprises.

Your Gut Feeling Is Right: Discovery Communications Is Crazy Cheap;3/31/2017;"It's not often that an investor has the opportunity to buy   shares in a fantastic business, one that not only sports an   exceptional record of high returns on invested capital, but one   that possesses a portfolio of brand-name media properties that   are practically assured a place in the entertainment consumption   habits of television viewers for years to come. And yet, as we   shall soon see, that is exactly what Foolish investors have   staring them in the face in shares ofDiscovery Communications(NASDAQ: DISCA) (NASDAQ: DISCB) .Image Source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();Recent resultsResults over the past year for Discovery Communications have   been decent. The owner of premium television channels such as   Discovery, TLC, Animal Planet, OWN, and The History Channel has   been extremely forward-thinking in adapting to the current   entertainment landscape. This has born fruit, as FY 2016's   results were more than respectable:MetricFY 2016FY 2015Revenue$6.18 billion$6.07 billionNet income$916 million$810 millionFree cash flow$1,285 million$1,174 millionData source:S&P Global Market Intelligence.Discovery's strong free-cash-flow generation is owed to the   simple fact that its media properties require very little in the   way of capital investment to maintain their positions: Capital   expenditures in FY 2016 were a paltry $88 million in FY 2016,   down from $103 million in FY 2015.""Discovering"" consistent returnsExceptional profitability is nothing new to Discovery   Communications. In fact, looking back over the last 10 years,   it's clear that Discovery is nothing less than an exceptional   business.DISCA Net Income (Annual)data byYCharts.DISCA Free Cash Flow (TTM)data byYCharts.This fact is further amplified by its average return on equity   over the last decade of 20.6% -- extremely high for the average   publicly traded corporation.All this for a low, low price ...As icing on the cake, Discovery Communications shares   currently trade for a song. With shares changing hands for around   $29 per share, the stock is valued by Mr. Market at just over 13   timesS&P Global Market Intelligence'sEPS estimates for FY 2017 of $2.17. What's more, after taking   into account management estimates and market trends, the   company's earnings growth into the 2020s is just as   attractive:MetricFY 2017FY 2018FY 2019FY 2020FY 2021Estimated EPS$2.17$2.44$2.67$2.81$3.29Data source:S&P Global Market Intelligence.With the market entering its eighth year of a secular bull   market, and the naturally high valuations that go along with such   a trend, this low valuation for a high-quality business more than   stands out from the crowd. However, there are a few storm clouds   overhead to keep an eye on.A few words of cautionWhile Discovery's ability to generate profits for its owners   is beyond dispute, it should be noted that media is a competitive   business to be in these days. Arguably far more competitive than   it was when Discovery Communications first staked its claim as   niche player in the industry. Not only do traditional cable   channels such as Discovery and TLC have to compete with other   cable offerings, but they must compete with the internet itself.   The simple fact of the matter is that YouTube's owner,Alphabet, didn't even exist when TLC was first created.It is not unimaginable that the company might slowly lose its   competitive position as the years go on, bringing its fantastic   profitability down with it.Foolish final thoughtsDiscovery Communication's stock is extremely cheap -- that is,   it trades for a ridiculously low price relative to its   demonstrable earning power. Its properties reach more than 2.8   billion viewers in well over 100 countries and in 40 languages.   Management has proven its ability to execute in the 21st century,   and shareholders can sleep well at night knowing that the   company's significant free cash flow generation will be put to   good use. All in all, the weight of the evidence points to   Discovery's shares being extremely undervalued. And while there   are no guarantees in investing, enterprising investors would   likely do well to give its shares very strong consideration.10 stocks we like better than Discovery     CommunicationsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

3 Hot Tech Stocks You Can Trade for Free Profits;3/31/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTech stocks have been on fire lately.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockFor the first quarter, theS&P 500should finish with gains of around 5.6%. TheTechnology SPDR (ETF)(NYSEARCA:XLK), however, is pacing for a 10%-plus gain. That includes a nice little burst to end the first three months of the year.That's good news for the equity markets, but it does make entry points into winning stocks a tricky feat. Most investors are left waiting for dips that are not coming. And when they finally enter late, sell stops kick in fast on the slightest retracement.Analysts' price targets are no help either. They are often difficult to use since they always seem behind the curve.Me? I prefer investing in mega-cap stocks that are backed by strong fundamentals - companies includingAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL),Amazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN), orApple Inc(NASDAQ:AAPL). However, I don't like to risk a big-up front cost to owning shares, which range from around $145 for AAPL to $890 for AMZN.10 Small-Cap Stocks That Could Double This QuarterLuckily, I have a solution to that - and trading ideas for how to profit off all three of these stocks for free.How to Earn Free Profits on Alphabet (GOOGL)Click to EnlargeAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL) has proven management with few flubs on their record. They own several platforms with more than a billion users each - and some aren't even properly monetized just yet. Sure, search is still the cash cow, but Alphabet is a dominant player in video and a leader in innovating the autonomous car market.As long as equity markets don't crash, Alphabet stock is going higher over time. However, instead of risking $850 per share to buy GOOGL, I will simply sell downside risk against proven support levels and let time do the rest.The trade:Sell a GOOGL Sep $730/$725 credit put spread. This is a bullish trade that has an 88% theoretical chance of yielding 14% on risk. This will surely rival the returns from buying the stock; I believe Alphabet will rally 14% over the next five months.Selling the put spread allows you to capture gains without a penny out of pocket. You just need GOOGL to stay above $730 through expiration.How to Earn Free Profits on Amazon (AMZN)Click to EnlargeAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) is the ultimate growth company. Under the leadership of Jeff Bezos, Amazon has dominated several major industries.Most notably, AMZN decimated the makeup of the retail sector. More recently, they quietly owned ""the cloud.""Yes, Amazon is highly valued, but that's only a concern if the company stops growing, which doesn't appear to be an issue. Furthermore, AMZN isn't burning cash, and it can turn off the spending spigot at any time.The trade:Sell the AMZN Jan 2018 $660 naked put for $11 per contract. I have a 90% theoretical certainty that AMZN stock will stay above my strike price. Otherwise, I will be forced to buy the shares at $660 even if they go lower. This would put me long Amazon stock at a 25% discount from current levels.10 Clobbered Stocks to Buy That Are About to Get Red-HotTo moderate the risk, I could do it as a credit put spread and yield 13% with 90% certainty. $649 is this trade's breakeven point.How to Earn Free Profits on Apple (AAPL)Click to EnlargeApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) is the giant on Wall Street. It has a massive following that is self-professed to be trapped in the Apple ecosystem. It sells out of every widget it makes, and its customers are committed to paying a premium.Apple's financial situation is pristine, too, so this is as close to a sure thing as once can get.My only long-term worry for AAPL stock is its leadership. Unless he changes his ways, Tim Cook could potentially ruin the company if he continues to fail in presenting the ""next big thing."" Iterations won't last forever, though they've been working well for years.Nevertheless, for the mid-term, I'm happy to bet alongside Apple's value.The trade:Sell the AAPL Dec $105 put and collect $1.50 per contract. By doing that, I am committing to buying Apple stock at $105 if it falls below it. So basically I am being paid for a chance to enter Apple long at a 25% discount from here.For more conservative traders, I can change this to a $115/$110 credit put spread for a chance to yield 13% on risk. The difference here is a finite risk profile, but for a slightly smaller price buffer.Selling options is risky, especially when selling puts at all-time high levels. Never risk more than you're willing to lose.Learn options as easy as 1-2-3here. Nicolas Chahine is the managing director ofSellSpreads.com.

Oculus Rift Co-Founder Palmer Luckey Resigns from Facebook;3/31/2017;"Per Bloomberg, which quotedFacebook Inc.FB, Oculus Rift co-founder Palmer Luckey has left the social media company. Notably, Facebook acquired Oculus for $2 billion in 2014.makeArticleAd();Palmer Luckey's departure was due to a controversy during the U.S. presidential election in 2016. We note that he remained mostly aloof from the media since reports surfaced that he was financing a group that created anti-Hillary Clinton memes for the web.Per Bloomberg, Facebook also distanced itself from Luckey on this issue. He also apologized via a Facebook post on Sep 23, 2016 and did not attend the company's Oculus Connect conference to avoid ""distractions"".Moreover, in Jan 2017, Luckey testified in a lawsuit filed against Facebook by ZeniMax Media, which claimed Oculus ""stole"" its intellectual property to boost its own Virtual Reality (VR) research. Per Bloomberg, Facebook lost the lawsuit, with the jury awarding $500 million to ZeniMax Media.We believe that Luckey's departure will not have any major impact on the operations of Oculus, which recently (Dec 2016) split into two units. This was also evident from the share price movement. Shares declined a negligible 0.17% to close at $142.41 on Mar 30.We note that Facebook has outperformed the ZacksInternet Servicesindustry on a year-to-date basis. While the stock returned 22.4%, the industry gained 8.9% over the same time frame.Oculus - Growth Catalyst for FacebookAccording to research firm Superdata, the global VR market is estimated to be worth almost $38 billion within the next three years, twenty times of $1.8 billion in 2016. In 2017, the market is expected to grow to almost $5 billion, up 168% over 2016.Further, per a recent IDC report, global revenues of the Augmented Reality (AR) /VR market are expected to grow at a CAGR of 181.3% from $5.2 billion in 2016 to over $162 billion in 2020.Though in its infancy, AR and VR technologies along with artificial intelligence are considered the next big business opportunities in the technology space, which is also evident from the aforesaid projections.Consequently, all the tech giants right from Facebook to MicrosoftMSFT, AmazonAMZNand AlphabetGOOGLare pumping huge resources to develop the new technology.We believe that Oculus is well positioned to tap this huge growth opportunity based on its expanding product portfolio, which now includes Rift as well as Motion Controllers (launched in Dec 2016). The company continues to invest in developing the product line and announced another $250 million investment to develop VR content ecosystem in Oct.2016.Facebook, Inc. Revenue (TTM)Facebook, Inc. Revenue (TTM)|Facebook, Inc. QuoteMoreover, the acquisition of Denmark-based startup, The Eye Tribe, will also boost product capabilities going forward. (Read More:Facebook Boosts VR Efforts with Eye Tribe Acquisition)ConclusionOculus has long been dubbed as a big growth driver along with Facebook's other product platforms like Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp.  However, the technology is yet to live up to expectations that are far higher than its other platforms.

IBM Gets Patent for Machine Learning Self-Driving Technology;3/31/2017;"International Business Machines CorporationIBMrecently announced that it has obtained a patent for a machine learning system, which is capable of switching control of an autonomous vehicle between a vehicle control processor and a human driver at the time of an emergency.For example, if the autonomous vehicle experiences some sort of an operational glitch such as a burned out headlight, a faulty braking system, poor visibility and bad road conditions, the system will evaluate whether the driver or the on-board self driving vehicle control processor is positioned to handle the situation and shift the control accordingly.We note that IBM has been taking huge strides in the autonomous driving technology space. In Jun 2016, the company collaborated with Local Motors, an AZ-based car maker to power the latter's electric minibus - Olli.However, shares of IBM have underperformed the ZacksComputer - Integrated Systemsindustry over the last one year. While the industry appreciated 19%, the stock gained 14%.The underperformance of the stock could be due to its time consuming transition to the cloud, weakness in traditional businesses, lower IT spending worldwide as well as an increasing competitive landscape.Scope for IBM in Autonomous DrivingAs per a report by the Boston Consulting Group,the autonomous driving technology market is estimated to reach a whopping $42 billion by 2025, which is further expected to grow to $77 billion by 2035.Competition is brewing with the presence of major players such as AlphabetGOOGL, IntelINTC, which recently acquired Mobileye, NVIDIANVDAand Tesla.However, we expect that with such patent wins, IBM is well positioned to take the competition head on through licensing the technology to third parties, which augurs well for the company in the long run.International Business Machines Corporation Revenue     (TTM)International Business Machines Corporation   Revenue (TTM)|International Business Machines Corporation QuoteDuring the last reported quarter, IBM's Cognitive Solutions (solutions software and transaction processing software) revenues grew 1.4% on a year-over-year basis (up 2.2% at constant currency) to $5.30 billion.Solutions software growth was driven primarily by analytics (Watson platform, Big Data, Information Integration).Zacks RankAt present, IBM carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

YouTube Scrambles as Advertisers Object to Questionable Content;3/31/2017;"In this segment fromMarket Foolery, Chris Hill welcomes Motley Fool analysts Jason Moser and     Taylor Muckerman to the show as they consider the problems that     come with being the largest site in the world for     user-generated video. YouTube is algorithmically dependent, butAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) has yet to come up with the     internal controls that can prevent ads from major partners     popping up next to videos with objectionable or offensive     content. Keep in mind these are some of the world's biggest     companies -- who have begun pulling advertising dollars -- so     the question is not a matter of if this problem can be fixed,     but how much Google will spend to fix it and how quickly.A full transcript follows the video.makeArticleAd();10 stocks we like better         than Wal-MartWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a         stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter         they have run for over a decade, the Motley Fool Stock         Advisor, has tripled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are         theten best stocksfor investors to buy right now… and Wal-Mart wasn't         one of them! That's right -- they think these 10         stocks are even better buys.Click hereto learn about these picks!*Stock Advisor returns as of March 6, 2017The author(s) may have a position in any stocks           mentioned.This video was recorded on March 27, 2017.Chris Hill:We have to start with a story that's been brewing for a little     while. I'll be honest. This is a story, I saw a     headline on this a week or two ago, and it registered like,     huh, that's interesting, and it continues to balloon. This     is the fact that a week ago, Google formally     apologized for running customer's ads alongside     objectionable videos. We've talked before about YouTube     and how important it is in the world of search, and how it's     one of the most popular places to search. And you see     these stories about, if YouTube was a stand-alone company,     it'd be worth somewhere in the neighborhood of $75     billion. Google makes this apology a week ago, and here we     are a week later, and I guess, among other things,     Jason, probably a reminder that YouTube is a really     big place with lots of videos, and therefore it's hard even for     the owners to monitor it.The Wall Street Journalhad this big story about howCoca-Cola,Microsoft,Amazon,Procter & Gamble, these mainstream brands, are still seeing their ads alongside     videos with racist content, anti-Semitic, all of this     stuff where the advertisers, rightfully so, say, ""I don't want     my ads next to that.""Jason Moser:Yeah. We're going to hit a point here, sooner or later,     it's going to be like you do with your kids, they can saysorryonly so many times before you're like, ""I get that you're     sorry. Just don't do it again. I'm not looking forsorryanymore."" So, I think with Google and YouTube, this is     obviously something that's a big deal. It's not something that     immediately impacts their bottom line. When we talk about the     bread and butter for Google's money-making machine, it's search     advertising. But, there's a good percentage, close to 20% of     that money, comes through advertising with third-party     customers. So, when ads go next to objectionable content, of     course, those parties are going to express concern, they want     to know what's going on, why is this happening, and what are     you going to do to make it stop? Because there is no middle     ground here. It's just, flat-out, ""This     is unacceptable, don't let it happen anymore."" This     is sort of one of those things with this age of automation, as     we go more toward automating everything, particularly on     the consumer-facing side, I think it's really difficult to     ever fall back on the old, ""Well, the algorithm did it, it     wasn't our fault."" Because, ultimately, someone built     the algorithm.I think what Google needs to figure out here     is, what is happening to make this happen, and how do they     fix it? And whether it is through technology, whether it's     through humanizing it a little bit more, and actually bringing     on more people to add a human touch to these customer     relationships, they need to do something with this before     this gets out of hand.We've talked about this a lot, especially in MDP, we own     shares of Alphabet, and we own shares ofFacebook(NASDAQ: FB) : We own a far larger position in     Facebook, and part of the reason for that is, when you look at     the direction things are headed in social, and in internet     behavior, there's no question that Facebook is becoming a     place, not just Facebook, but its properties, whether     it's WhatsApp or Instagram or whatever properties they buy     in the future, that's a place where eyeballs go to hang out for     a while. Google is more utilitarian in nature, right? You     need some information, you find it on Google, and you go to     your next place. Facebook is catching up very quickly.     They've expressed some concerns that perhaps the last     decade was the Google decade, and perhaps this next decade     is the Facebook decade. If that is the case, and the numbers     certainly point toward that, the argument could at least     be made there, Google has got to figure out something     yesterday as to how to address this and fix it,     because blaming it on the technology is not going to     fly.Taylor Muckerman:I'm pretty confident that they're going to figure out a     way to fix it. Especially when you're talking about     Facebook, they had the whole issue around the election     with fake news on their site. And you had a group     of college kids come out and make an algorithm that was     able to identify fake news on the site, and they've been     able -- not using their algorithm, but, Facebook has been     able to address that. I'm confident that Google will. You talk     about big headlines about this, but I'm waiting for the     headline to come out that says, right now, people think that     less than 1% of Google's revenue is at risk because of this.     It's a $90 billion revenue company, I've seen headlines     that say $750 million might come off of YouTube's revenue in     2017 because of this. Bigger fraction of YouTube's     revenue, but you're not just an investor in YouTube when     you buy a stock in Alphabet. So, I'm still confident that     they'll figure it out. And between the two of them, Facebook     and Google, they're pretty much the only two that are growing     in the digital ad space. So, I find it hard to believe that     advertisers are going to completely move away from Google.     Right now, Facebook is really the only alternative, and     that space would become far too crowded too quickly if there     was a mass exodus from Google. I'm fairly confident that,     because you said 20% of their revenue comes from that search     advertising, they're going to figure this out.Hill:It is a small amount of money, and yet, when you look at     the headline ofPepsi,Starbucks,General Motors,Wal-Marthave pulled some of their ad spend with YouTube. Those     are big-name companies. I think, if you're     Facebook, you're not throwing a parade over this, but I     think if you're selling video advertising for Facebook, you're     on the phone to different media agencies, and I also think     television networks. If you're a broadcast network or     cable network, to use your phrase, Jason, you're putting     the human touch to work, and you're calling these companies and     saying, ""Listen, don't take a risk with the     programmatic algorithm approach to YouTube. You     know what you're going to get with our networks, and     you're going to get something that associates well with     your brand.""Muckerman:With some of those companies you     mentioned, those are companies that can afford     to pull back for a week or two on advertising     and make a statement. That's almost advertising in     itself. They're still advertising using Google's name, just not     using Google's platform. So, I think they'll come     back eventually. Probably not too far down the line. Those     brands are brands already. You're probably looking at the     smaller players, questioning whether or not they can     afford to back off of Google's platform a little bit more than     Coke or Pepsi.Moser:Yeah, and I think it's also worth noting, for the     longest time, YouTube has been synonymous with online     video. That's what got this ball rolling. And they've     enjoyed such a phenomenal competitive position for so     long. What an acquisition Google made for ... what did they buy     it for?Hill:$1.6 billion.Muckerman:Pennies on the current dollar.Hill:And the reason I remember it was $1.6     billion is because I was one of the people saying,     ""Boy, they sure did pay a lot of money for that.""Moser:So, I think you fast forward today and you see how this     competitive environment has changed, Google and YouTube     are not the only players in the online video space.     And you see all sorts of companies, from Facebook andTwittertoVerizonandAT&Tdeveloping their online video offerings. To your point, I     think it's very easy to see these customers pulling back for a     week, a month, and saying, ""Hey, let's reasses what's going on     here."" Google and YouTube are too big to say, ""We don't want to     be a part of your environment."" That's just foregoing a     tremendous reach that anybody in their right     mind would want to be a part of. But, what it could do     is, it could result in some pricing competition. It can     certainly make Google have to get in there and compete a bit     more on pricing, lose a bit, perhaps, of that pricing     power, particularly as we ship to mobile, and we know     those mobile advertisements are not nearly as lucrative as the     desktops were, from a real estate perspective. But, these     are smart people running a very, very big company. The solution     to this really is as simple as, listen to your customers     and give them what they want. So, from that perspective, I     don't see any reason why they can't fix it. I guess it's going     to be interesting to see how they fix it, and how quickly     they go about fixing it, because they don't enjoy that same     competitive position that they enjoyed, perhaps, five years     ago.Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The     Motley Fool's board of directors.

Lululemon Athletica Inc. (LULU) Stock Shows the Ugly Side of Retail;3/31/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips""I don't do retail,"" is something my father has always said when it comes to investing. It's one of the wisest pieces of advice I've ever gotten with regards to investing. If you can catch a stock likeLululemon Athletica Inc.(NASDAQ:LULU)during good times, you'll be happy. But as a risk-averse investor, LULU stock is exactly the kind of stock I would not touchin my forthcoming stock advisory newsletter, The Liberty Portfolio.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockQ4 earnings for Lululemon stock came out, and the way the market reacted shows exactly why I avoid stocks like this.Q4 revenue increased 12% to $790 million from $704 million. That's dandy. Even more dandy is that comparable sales increased 8%. Any retail operation that grows comps by more than 5% is impressive. But 8%? Very strong.Gross margins increased dramatically to 54.2% compared to 50.3%. Gross margins are a great indicator that shows how efficient revenue generation is in regards to expenses. This is a gigantic year-over-year gain that is very impressive.Margin expansion filtered to the operating line, also. Operating income was up 18% to $197 million, with margins of 24.9% compared to 23.6%. I ignore earnings-per-share because that is easily muddied using share buybacks. However, backing those out, we find net income rose to $136.1 million from $117.4 million, or 16%.Where Did LULU Stock Go Wrong?There is very little to dislike about any of this. So why was Lululemon stock down 23% as I was writing this article? Let's see if there's something funky about the FY results.10 Stocks You'd Be Foolish to Buy Right NowRevenue increased 14% to $2.3 billion from $2.1 billion. Comparable sales increased 6%. Gross profit increased 20% to $1.2 billion, and once again, gross margins jumped big time, to 51.2% compared to 48.4%.Operating income increased 14% to $421 million, although we can see the operating margin improvement came mostly from this quarter, as FY was 18% compared to 17.9%. FY net income was $303.4 million, up from $266 million, or 14%.What's not to like? Guidance. This is the reason I hate retail stocks like LULU stock. A company can deliver a solid quarter, but then say that sales were going to be weaker in Q1 and then … BLAM! Specifically, Lululemon said the comps would be in the low-single digits for the quarter and for the year.What I found bizarre, however, was that they are blaming this on manufacturing gear with bland colors, when consumers seem to want brighter colors for spring.Bottom Line on Lululemon StockFirst of all, what athletic clothing maker doesn't do what every other regular retailer figured out decades ago: Spring means color! Second, look what the market does to a dumb move like this! It didn't just sell the stock, it beat it with a baseball bat.Why Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Is Still the Alpha DogSo I don't care how strong margins are or how net income is growing impressively for Lululemon stock. There is too much risk in retail and I have seen this story play out countless times over my investing career. The tiniest thing can crater a stock and that fall could suddenly turn out to be permanent.That's not to say that LULU stock is going to fall apart and the company is going to end in bankruptcy. Hardly. It has $739 million in cash and no long-term debt, and generated $385 million in operating cash flow. This is a very healthy business with a very healthy balance sheet. The problem is that owning Lululemon stock will give you heartburn.Can you do anything with LULU stock? I think most retail stocks are trading vehicles. If you feel like taking on risk, you could buy here, set a 5% to 7% stop loss on Lululemon stock and see if you can catch a rebound.Lawrence Meyers is the CEO of PDL Capital, a specialty lender focusing on consumer finance.

Why Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Is Still the Alpha Dog;3/31/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAt the risk of sounding like a broken record,Alphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG,NASDAQ:GOOGL) is the most elite value stock available. First, the obvious fact is that GOOGL stock owns that little thing called the internet. It may have beeninventedby former Vice-president Al Gore, but Alphabet took it to a whole new level. By logical deduction, an investment in Alphabet stock is an investment in digitalization - not a bad gig at all!makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockThe other reason why GOOGL stock sits atop an extremely exclusive club is consistency.Find me a company that is as reliable and has as much potential as Alphabet. The night is still young, but shares have only suffered three annual losses. Of those, only one - in 2008 - registered in the double digits. The other down years in 2010 and 2014 average losses of about 5%.On the plus side, from 2005 through the end of 2016, GOOGL stock is averaging over 24%. Granted, not every year is stellar. But if the end game is a long-term, steady buffer for your portfolio, you can't go wrong with Alphabet stock. It probably won't provide the fireworks of yesteryear, but this is more of a slow burn. Sometimes, you have to have patience for quality work.Still, I understand the concerns. Psychologically speaking, GOOGL stock has a hefty price tag. Can investors rely upon it over the next ten to twenty years?The Big Risk With Alphabet StockThe biggest fundamental risk to GOOGL stock is the ""one-trick pony"" argument.10 Safe Dividend Stocks to Own During the Next Market CrashAs InvestorPlace contributor Lawrence Meyersexplains, ""Alphabet is the largest digital advertising billboard in the world, with about 88% of its revenues coming from advertising. Moreover, GOOGL stock's growth has been driven by this spectacular seizure of internet territory from competitors. In fact, during the financial crisis, ad revenues still grew about 8% year-over-year in 2009 despite a worldwide ad revenue decline of 11% that year.""For now, GOOGL exercises unprecedented dominance, and Alphabet stock is surely buoyed by this leverage. As Meyers further notes, ""[i]t could get hit with a 20% decline in total revenues, which would bring it roughly in line with fiscal year 2015 results, and still generate net income of $15 billion or so."" Ordinarily, a double-digit sales hit leads to automatic hemorrhaging in the markets. However, GOOGL stock could earn a reprieve.The problem is what happens in the future? Will people continue toGooglethings on the internet? Or will there be some other innovation brought forth by Silicon Valley? It seems ridiculous to ask the question, but we've seen this trend before. Not too long ago, the science of instant (physical) photography was exclusivelyPolaroid's domain. Today, Polaroid is basically a shell company. Even the term ""instant photography"" isn't used much anymore.As great as Alphabet stock is, let's be real - this is not a balanced investment. A paradigm shift in internet advertising can potentially topple GOOGL.More Good Than Bad for GOOGLWhile I respect the risks, I'm confident that the positives far outweigh the negatives for Alphabet stock. First off, the one-trick pony argument doesn't scare me as much because we're not talking about commoditized leverage.What is the internet? Many might answer what they do on the internet, and quite frankly, I don't want to know. But all the responses you might receive boils down to this - it's the forum for the exchange of ideas. Ideas never go out of style. Because of that one single fact, I highly doubt that Alphabet will, either.The internet has evolved, and dramatically so.What Al Gore invented decades ago metamorphosed into its own, nearly self-aware entity. The true beauty of this network is that it levels the informational playing field. No longer is data strictly limited to the halls of academia. Anybody can propose a new idea, or an innovation, and this can rapidly proliferate without the need for credentials.Yes, FireEye Inc (FEYE) Stock Is for RealThat, my friends, is the power of GOOGL stock. This is a company that will adapt and evolve to whatever challenges it faces. So long as they keep that corporate culture intact, you're not going to find a better value play than Alphabet stock.GOOGL Stock: Competition Is Still BehindFor those that are worried about Alphabet's competition, I'd set those aside. Yes,Facebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) can make some noise, andAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is always up to something. These are companies that service their sectors like no other. Because of that, people use those services based on their earned reputation.GOOGL has the internet. That much is obvious because Google is a verb. Other company names invoke a function. Wefriendeach other on Facebook. Webuystuff on Amazon. The commoditized criticism is more applicable to them. Someone might invent a better way to network online. Another person might offer cheaper and faster e-retailing.But a better way to internet? Again, I highly doubt that anyone can compete with Alphabet. For better or for worse, they've got their tentacles entrenched into everything web-related. So you can rest easy with GOOGL stock. Neither the company nor the opportunity is going anywhere but up.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 Small-Cap Stocks That Could Double in the Next 3 MonthsThe 7 Best Stocks to Buy for an Income-Rich Retirement3 Artificial Intelligence Stocks to Buy for Monster ProfitsThe postWhy Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Is Still the Alpha Dogappeared first onInvestorPlace."

How Many Users Does Facebook Have?;3/30/2017;"On pace to hit 2 billion monthly active users in 2017,Facebook(NASDAQ: FB) is the world's largest social network by a long   shot. But exactly how many users does Facebook have? And what can   be learned about these users?Here's a look at the most telling statistics about Facebook's   users.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();1.86 billion:Facebook has 1.86 billion monthly active users -- far ahead of   the rest of the world's social networks. The next three largest   social networks, for instance, are each 700 million or more users   behind Facebook. WhatsApp has 1.2 billion monthly active users,   and YouTube and Facebook Messenger each have about 1 billion   monthly active users as of last count (a complete list of the   world's 10 largest social networks can be foundhere).17%:Facebook's monthly active users continue to grow at a rapid rate.   The company's 1.86 billion monthly active users achieved in the   fourth quarter of 2016 is up 17% year over year.Data source: Facebook's quarterly SEC filings. Chart by     author.66%:Perhaps where Facebook's user statistics shine the most is the   percentage of monthly active users that use the service every   single day. This rate, often referred to Facebook's engagement   rate, was 66% throughout 2016 -- up from 65% in 2015.18%:Facebook's daily active users actually increased slightly faster   than its monthly active users in 2016. Daily active users by the   end of the year were 1.23 billion, up 18% year over year from   1.04 billion in 2015.94%:Today, Facebook is almost entirely mobile driven. Of Facebook's   1.86 billion monthly active users, 94% of them -- or 1.74 billion   -- are also monthly active users on mobile devices.1.15 billion:Further highlighting how important mobile is to Facebook, 1.15   billion monthly active usersonlyuse Facebook on mobile devices. Facebook calls these people   mobile-only monthly active users, and they soared 40% between   2015 and 2016.Data source: Q4 2016 SEC filing. Chart by author.Unsurprisingly, 84% of Facebook's advertising revenue in the   fourth quarter of 2016 came from ads on mobile devices.231 million:Believe it or not, the U.S. and Canada is Facebook's smallest   geographic segment in terms of monthly active users. Facebook   pegs monthly active users in the region at 231 million. It has   349 million in Europe, 673 million in Asia-Pacific, and 606   million in the rest of the world.51%:Despite being its smallest segment measured by monthly active   users, the U.S. and Canada together accounted for over half of   Facebook's advertising revenue in the fourth quarter of 2016.   Advertising revenue in the U.S. and Canada was $4.4 billion. Ad   revenues in Europe, Asia-Pacific, and rest of the world were $2   billion, $1.4 billion, and $832 million, respectively.$15.98:In 2016, Facebook generated an average of $15.98 of revenue per   monthly active user. This is up about 34% from its $11.96 of   average revenue per user in 2015.At the rate Facebook is currently growing its user base, the   company is well on its way to hitting 2 billion monthly active   users in 2017. Indeed, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is aiming far   beyond 2 billion users.

Forget Expedia, Invest in These 4 Internet Stocks Instead;3/30/2017;"Online travel booking company ExpediaEXPEseems to be in troubled waters. In the last reported quarter, the company disappointed with its earnings results. Also, it carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), with a weak earnings history.What Happened Last QuarterThe company reported disappointing fourth-quarter earnings of 97 cents per share which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.11. This was because the company increased its expenditure on acquisitions.Expedia has embarked on a large number of acquisitions to strengthen its position in the domestic market and expand internationally. But while this has increased its top line, it has brought on board a variety of different businesses that have to be integrated into its core. Moreover, these businesses require separate marketing and promotion costs, which could be a reason why these costs are rising exponentially.The company's quarterly revenues fell 18.9% sequentially to $2.09 billion.However, revenues were up 23.3% year over year and ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.07 billion. Also, gross bookings decreased 13.4% sequentially.Weak Outlook for the Upcoming QuarterExpedia expects revenue and profitability to be negatively impacted, as Easter has shifted to the second quarter this year. The company expects pressure on margin early this year due to investments in selling & marketing ahead of the travel season.In terms of technology & content expense, Expedia expects spending to increase a shade faster than revenues in the upcoming quarter. Also, for 2017, the company expects additional spending to be largely offset by lower infrastructure CapEx requirements.Downward Earnings RevisionsRight now, Expedia's earnings picture doesn't look good. In the last 60 days, three out of five analysts revised their earnings estimates downward for the current quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this quarter also shrank considerably in the last 30 days, deteriorating from a loss of 22 cents to a loss of 27 cents.Also, Expedia missed our earnings consensus estimate twice in the last four quarters.Coming to the price performance, over the past one year, shares of Expedia underperformed the Zacks categorized Electronic Commerce industry. While the industry gained 38.34%, the stock returned 20.26%.Turnaround EffortsHowever, Expedia is not sitting on its hands. To counter the current market conditions, management is refocusing on operational formula, expansion of supply portfolio, optimization of marketing channels globally and growth of repeat user base.These measures might seem impressive initially but could take some time before yielding results. As of now, it is advisable to steer clear of Expedia.4 Internet Stocks to ConsiderUnderstandably, there is nothing that boosts confidence in Expedia's stock right now. Nevertheless, the technology sector still has a few promising stocks to offer.This is where our Zacks proprietary methodology comes in handy. Our research shows that stocks with VGM Scores of 'A' or 'B' when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or Zacks Rank #2 emerge as good investment opportunities. You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks   here.By using our screener, we bring forth four such stocks:MeetMe Inc.MEETowns and operates a social network. The company enables users to meet new people through social games and apps, monetized by both advertising and virtual currency. MeetMe carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and has a VGM score of A.

Telecom Stock Roundup: AT&T, Verizon Withdraw Advertisements from YouTube, Comcast to Rebrand Stream;3/30/2017;"The telecom industry had a steady run on the bourse last week with most of the key stocks trading in the green. A few developments even made it to the headlines.U.S. telecom behemoths AT&T Inc.Tand Verizon Communications Inc.VZhave decided to suspend their marketing campaign on Google's YouTube site. The reason behind the decision is the appearance of their ads alongside offensive and highly controversial videos promoting adult contents, terrorism and hate speeches. Notably, Google is a division of Alphabet Inc.GOOGL.According to Reuters, Comcast Corp.CMCSA- the largest cable multi service operator in the U.S. and a media giant - is considering a strategic decision to rebrand its existing TV streaming service, Stream. The company intends to make it available across its footprint. The new service called ""Xfinity Instant TV"" will be available in larger U.S. markets such as Philadelphia, Washington D.C. and Chicago. It is expected to start in the third quarter of 2017.Notably, as per a recent Bloomberg report, Comcast has gained rights from several unnamed cable networks to offer online TV services nationwide. The cable MSO reportedly got the rights using the 'most favored nation' clauses in contracts. This, for the first time, allows Comcast to sell video services to new cities outside its regional territories, like New York and Los Angeles.Media reports suggest that AT&T is planning to stop support for parts of its long-standing U-verse brand by the end of May. The brand consists of fiber-based triple-play video (TV), voice (telephony) and high-speed broadband (Internet) offerings. This move is in line with AT&T's strategy to focus on streaming development application development on core platforms.By venturing into the over-the-top (OTT) space, AT&T joined the likes of DISH Network Corp.'sDISHInternet TV service - Sling TV and Sony Corp.'sSNEPlaystation Vue. The U-verse move is expected to involve ending support for U-verse streaming through the XBOX ONE, Windows and U-verse.com applications.Meanwhile, as per a recent report by FierceCable, U.S. telecom behemoth Verizon Communications has collaborated with Luxembourg-based satellite operator, SES, to test the latter's Ultra High Definition (UHD) platform in order to deliver 4K content to FiOS customers.Verizon currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy)   stocks here.Outside the U.S., BCE Inc.'sBCEsubsidiary, Bell Canada on Mar 27, announced plans to invest $854 million in a project that aims to connect millions of homes and businesses in Montreal with their fastest broadband fibre technology. This investment, one of the largest-ever communications infrastructure project in Quebec, is likely to generate almost 2,700 direct and indirect jobs along with an additional $2.2 billion for other economic development purposes.Read the lastTelecom Stock Roundup for Mar 23, 2017.Recap of the Week's Most Important Stories1.    The decision of Verizon and AT&T to pull backall their advertising from Google's non-search platforms, including YouTube as well as third-party websites that Google partners with, issignificant as telephone operators are among the biggest block of advertisers in corporate America. The two companies together spent $6.6 billion in advertisement in 2015. According to Kantar Media, Verizon and AT&T were the third and fourth largest ad spenders in the U.S. respectively, in 2016.  (Read more:AT&T & Verizon Suspend Marketing Advertisements from YouTube)2.    A major difference between Comcast's streaming services and other companies offering is that Xfinity Instant TV will be available solely to the company's high-speed broadband (Internet) subscribers. The service won't count against Comcast subscribers' Internet data caps unlike other competitor's services. As a result, Comcast's high-speed Internet customers will gain significant advantage over the customers of its rival firms.  (Read more:Is Comcast Planning to Relaunch TV Streaming?)3.    AT&T plans to shift some U-verse customers to satellite TV service provider DIRECTV, while some will be transferred to its OTT online streaming service, DirecTV Now. This strategic move bodes well with U-verse brand performance wakening compared with the improved business of DIRECTV. Moving forward, this in turn is expected to free up crucial bandwidth on its fiber-optic network, which AT&T can utilize to offer higher data transmission speeds to high-speed broadband users.  (Read more:What's Going on with AT&T's U-verse Service?)4.    Bell Canada has partnered with a number of local suppliers such as Asplundh, Effigis Geo-Solutions, G-Tek, Infrastructel, Telecon, TCI and TRJ Telecom to complete the Montreal project. The company will install more than 7,000 kilometres of new fibre and upgrade 25 central offices across Montreal. Further, more than 90% of Bell's network in the city is on aerial structures which will help speed up the deployment of the new fibre links.  (Read more:BCE's Arm Invests $854M, Boosts Fibre-Optics Network Suite)5.    Verizon's FiOS' fiber network, with its adequate bandwidth, is apt for delivering 4K UHD to customers. The collaborative agreement between SES and Verizon marks an important milestone in the development of Ultra HD solution. The trial will eventually help Verizon offer the next generation of HD programming to FiOS TV customers throughout the U.S. and prepare for a wider 4K rollout in the near future.

Apple Inc. (AAPL) Will Lose Its App Store Crown to Android;3/30/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsA new report has been released with comprehensive stats for the global market for mobile apps. App Annie says thatApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) served up a fraction of the downloads ofAlphabet Inc's(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Play for 2016, yet continued to dominate the revenue side of the business.makeArticleAd();Source: AppleApple's App Store revenue is predicted to continue topping Google Play as the most lucrative through to 2021. It's expected that all Android app stores combined will overtake Apple's App Store sales at some point this year.Report on Mobile App Downloads and RevenueApp Annie is a firm that tracks global app downloads and app store revenue. A detailed report - which was made available onAppleInsider- sheds light onwhat's currently happening in the mobile app market, along with forecasts to 2021.According to App Annie, AAPL's App Store revenue is about to be surpassed for the first time by the combination of Google Play and third party Android app stores. While Apple remained on top for 2016, with $34 billion in app sales versus a combined $27 billion for Android, in 2017 the lead is expected to shift. Apple App Store revenue is pegged at $40 billion, while Android app stores are on track to book a combined $41 billion.The 7 Best Stocks to Buy for an Income-Rich RetirementApple continues to be on top as the single largest app store by sales, with its $40 billion for 2017 expected to nearly double second place Google Play's $21 billion. Apple's iOS also stays firmly in the lead as the platform where users are most likely to pay for apps. Apple's $40 billion in revenue is expected to come from 30 billion downloads. Google Play's $21 billion will come from 114 billion downloads, making Apple's App Store a much more lucrative prospect for developers.The App Annie numbers show that Android's sheer numbers advantage, however, is once again showing results.Apple App Store Revenue ExplainsSuper Mario RunOne of the best recent examples of how the difference between appdownloadsversus apppurchasesplays out wasNintendo Co., Ltd (ADR)'s(OTCMKTS:NTDOY)Super Mario Run.This was Nintendo's first full-fledged foray into mobile gaming. Built around one of the most recognizable Nintendo characters of all time, smartphone ownerssalivated at the chance to play.When the game was released in 2016, if one platform was going to have an edge at getting Mario first, sheer numbers would say it should have been Google Play. With more than double the downloads of the Apple App Store, Google Play would have putSuper Mario Runonto a lot more devices. But Nintendochose to make Super Mario run an iOS exclusiveinstead.Despite there being far fewer iPhones out there than Android smartphones, AAPL's App Store revenue shows that those iPhone users are far more likely topayfor a game. Android users had to wait until last week to finally get their hands on the title. And that's been the model that many premium app developers continue to follow, despite Google Play's numbers lead.If it's a high-profile app that cost a lot to develop and you expect people to pay for it, the Apple App Store tends to get it first - if Google Play gets it at all.Will the Shift to Android Dominance Hurt Apple?Services - which includes App Store revenue - has become anincreasingly important division for AAPL. It posted the highest growth of any of Apple's divisions last year and AAPL netted $3 billion in revenue from app downloads last December alone.Is that revenue in jeopardy? That shouldn't be the case, for three reasons.First, the Apple App Store is expected to remain comfortably on top as the single largest app store for revenue through 2021.Second, a huge chunk of the revenue growth on the Android side is coming from third party Chinese app stores. These tend to be focused on that market, and don't compete against the West.Third, every year it gets more difficult and more expensive to develop and support apps for Android. There are so many versions of the operating system in use and so many different smartphones running it that testing and ensuring a good user experience - something that's critical for premium apps - is time consuming, costly and still doesn't guarantee results.Bottom Line on Apple's App StoreApple has weathered a number of negative milestones as a result of the sheer numbers of Android users. In 2011, the number of Android smartphones leapt past the number of iPhones in the American market. In 2013, Google Play took the lead in the number of app downloads for the first time. And in 2015, the Apple App Store was surpassed by Google Play for having the most apps available.If Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Has a Shot at a Breakout, This Is ItDespite the dominance of Android smartphones, App Store sales continue growing at a healthy pace, and it's expected to keep doing so despite the latest stat. According to App Annie's predictions, that means growth to $40 billion in revenue this year and $60 billion by 2021 (compared to $78 billion combined for Android). Not bad for a platform expected to see appdownloadsat that time outnumbered 7-to-1 by the competition.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceThe 7 Best REITs to Buy for Big (And Growing!)

This includes the ability to use the Autosteer feature while going 80 mph. The previous limit was 55 mph.While the Autosteer update is out, it will still be a couple of days before owners of a Tesla Inc vehicle can use it at 80 mph. This is due to thecameras on the car needing calibration.

The first is Auto Lane Change, which lets users change lanes with Autosteer by using a turn signal. The second new feature is called ""Summon"".

Why Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock Needs an Innovative Edge;3/30/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhile stock inApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) andAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) has been on fire since the start of the year,Microsoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) shares seem becalmed. MSFT stock is up 6%, adding about $25 billion to its market cap, but that gain not only trails its tech rivals, as the NASDAQ average is up 9.56%.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockHow bad is it? It's so bad that Amazon founder Jeff Bezos is threatening to overtake Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates as the world's richest man. He's just $10 billion behind after trade closed Mar 29.This is not down to any complacency on the part of CEO Satya Nadella and his team. If anything, they're moving faster than ever. But Microsoft's days as a monopolist are over. Its products must all earn their way. They're all facing competition in the marketplace. A person or even a company can live without MSFT, and while the company may see this as liberating, some investors are treating it as a reason to worry.MSFT Stock: A Gaming CompetitorFor example, Microsoft investors should be bullish at its efforts in gaming, but there is plenty of competition.Gaming is where developers, and customers, are pushing the envelope on PC performance. People will spend a lot more for a game machine than for any other type of console device. MSFT stock is in the middle of it.10 Clobbered Stocks to Buy That Are About to Get Red-HotThe latest version of Windows 10, called Creators Update, will feature lots of new gaming features when itlaunches April 11, butit's not the revolution the company promisedwhen they announced it last fall.Microsoft stock got into gaming through the Xbox console. The latest version brought in $9.1 billion last year and holds26% of the market.But it's not No.1, as that honor goes toSony Corp (ADR)(NYSE:SNE) and its PlayStation 4. Nor is it the hottest new console. That's theNintendo Co., Ltd. (ADR)(OTCMKTS:NTDOY)Switch.MSFT has launched its own game streaming service,Beam Streaming, but that must compete with Amazon's market-leading Twitch service. Game delivery is a niche controlled by privately-heldSteam, founded by former Microsoft employees in 1996 and now majority-owned by Gabe Newell.Still, there is ample room for growth in gaming, and Microsoft alone has a position in every important niche.Microsoft Stock's New Hope: AzureNadella made his name at Microsoft building Azure, the company's cloud business. His strategy has been to put all of MSFT's offerings into Azure, to offer its software directly to users through Azure, and to use cloud-based applications to dominate the enterprise market.He can argue that it's working. Microsoft's revenue from Azure-fed businesses, which now includes Office 365, is $14 billion, and Azure should deliver $2.5 billion in hosting revenueall by itself.While Amazon dominates the cloud infrastructure market with a share of over 80%, what investors focus on is the growing competition between Azure andAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), whichsome analysts think Google will win.That would be a disaster for Microsoft stock.Office 365 faces growing competition fromGoogle's G Suite, and that in turn meansgrowing competition for PCs from Google Chromebooks, which are especially gaining share in educationbecause they're cheaper, with more of their functions online.Nothing comes easy anymore.The Bottom Line for MSFT StockAnalysts are generally positive about Microsoft stock, but one-third have it off their buy lists. They expect 69 cents per share of earnings on $22.47 billion in revenue when the company reports April 27, which would represent 10% more revenue and almost 50% more profit than the company delivered in the March quarter last year.Bullish on Snap Inc (SNAP) Stock? Then Answer This QuestionMicrosoft today is the third-largest company in the world, by market cap, at $505 billion. But its operations must race hard to stay in place. Google is ahead, and Amazon is coming up from behind. Technology dominates the stock market, and MSFT stock remains a part of most technology portfolios.Nadella has saved the company. It's no longer at risk to falling off pace likeInternational Business Machines Inc.(NYSE:IBM). Its price-to-earnings ratio of nearly 31 is slightly higher than Google's at 30, and well ahead of Apple's at 17. But there's not one part of Microsoft that can afford to be complacent, and that's a sea change.Dana Blankenhornis a financial and technology journalist.

Top 10 Social Networks: How Many Users Are on Each?;3/30/2017;"A network effect is arguably one of the most powerful   competitive advantages a business can have. While network effects   can come in different forms, the concept is simple: A business   benefits from a network effect when the value of its platform   increases with each additional user that joins.Social networks are great examples of businesses with network   effects. But which social networks are the largest? Measured by   their monthly active users, the top 10 social networks range from   user counts of 313 million all the way to an impressive 1.9   billion. Here are world's top social networks, along with some   interesting takeaways about this list.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();World's biggest social networksFacebook (1.9 billion users)WhatsApp (1.2 billion users)YouTube (1 billion users since 2013)Messenger (1 billion users since 2016)WeChat/Weixin (889 million users)QQ (869 million users)Qzone (638 million users)Instagram (600 million users)Twitter (319 million users)Weibo (313 million users)In a chart, the world's top 10 social networks look like   this:Data from company press releases and SEC filings. *YouTube     is ranked higher than Messenger since YouTube achieved this     milestone in 2013 and Messenger achieved it in 2016. In     addition, YouTube hasn't shared any recent updates on its     users, but it's likely larger than Messenger today. Platforms     without reliable user data or insignificant social     characteristics were excluded. Chart by author..Facebook dominates the listIt's fair to say thatFacebook(NASDAQ: FB) knows a thing or two about building successful   social networks. The company absolutely dominates this list.Not only do the 1.9 billion monthly active users on the   company's core Facebook app beat out the rest of the world's   social networks by 700 million users or more, but also three of   the top four social networks are all Facebook properties.   Facebook's messaging apps, WhatsApp and Messenger, have 1.2   billion and 1 billion monthly active users, respectively. And   Facebook's photo- and video-sharing app Instagram -- at 600   million users -- made the list as well.Image source: Facebook.In addition, Facebook's social networks continue to grow   rapidly. Even the company's core Facebook app saw its monthly   active users grow a nice 17% year over year in the fourth quarter   of 2016. This growth rate easily beatsTwitter's 4% year-over-year growth in the same period, despite the fact   that Twitter's growth is on a much smaller base.Tencent is crushing it in ChinaBelieve it or not, there's another dominant company on the   list. While many people in North America may be unfamiliar with   its social networks, Chinese internet companyTencent Holdings(NASDAQOTH: TCEHY) owns three of these 10 social networks: WeChat   and Weixin (essentially different modes of the same app), QQ, and   Qzone. These social networks are the fifth, sixth, and seventh   largest social networks in the world.Image source: WeChat.Notably, the fact that Facebook and Tencent together account   for a whopping seven of the top eight social networks reinforces   how strong of a competitive advantage social networks have. By   flexing the significant reach and breadth across their platforms   and integrating features across the networks under their name,   Facebook and Tencent offer significant value to their users and   to the businesses who make money on their networks.Snapchat isn't so hot after allOne surprising social network that didn't even make the list   is Snapchat, owned by parent companySnap(NYSE: SNAP) , which just went public in March. Despite being one   of the biggest IPOs in recent history, Snapchat has about 301   million monthly active users, according to estimates by   Statista.But Snapchat could make it onto this list soon. Though Snap   opts to only share its daily active users with investors, this   metric was up sharply in the fourth quarter of 2016, suggesting   Snapchat still has some growth ahead of it. Snapchat's daily   active users hit 158 million during this period, up 48% year   over year.Image source: Getty Images.Can Facebook and Tencent continue to dominate the list in   years to come, proving the staying power of a network effect? Or   are the world's biggest social networks more susceptible to   disruption than might be thought? For now, Facebook and Tencent's   prevailing presence on this list suggests the biggest social   networks won't be knocked from dominance easily.10 stocks we like better than FacebookWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Zacks Earnings Trends Highlights: Apple, Alphabet, Facebook and Micron;3/30/2017;"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL - March 30, 2017 - Zacks Director of Research Sheraz Mian says, ""For Q1 as a whole, total earnings are expected to be up +6.6% from the same period last year on +6.5% higher revenues.""Looking Ahead to Q1 Earnings SeasonNote: The following is an excerpt from this week'sEarnings Trendsreport. You can access the full report that contains detailed   historical actuals and estimates for the current and following   periods,please click here>>>The small sample of Q1 earnings reports that have come out already present a reassuring view of this reporting cycle, with growth as well as positive surprises tracking above what had seen from that same group of companies in the preceding quarter. But with Q1 results from only 17 S&P 500 members out at this stage, the sample's small size stops us from looking for trends. Please note that these initial reports are from companies reporting results for their fiscal quarters in February, which get counted as part of the Q1 tally.For Q1 as a whole, total earnings are expected to be up +6.6% from the same period last year on +6.5% higher revenues. This would follow +7.4% earnings growth in 2016 Q4 on +4.7% top-line gains, which was the highest growth pace in two years.Estimates for Q1 came down as the quarter unfolded, with the current +6.6% growth down from +10.4% at the end of December.Please note that while Q1 estimates have followed this well traversed path that we have been seeing consistently over the last few years, the magnitude of negative revisions compares favorably to other periods. In other words, Q1 estimates have come down, but they haven't come down by as much as has historically been the case. We saw this trend of decelerating negative revisions ahead of the preceding earnings season as well, which justifies the market's favorable view of the overall earnings picture.At the sector level, 8 of the 16 Zacks sectors are expected to earn more relative to the year-earlier period, with earnings growth for the Technology sector expected to be up +10.8% from the same period last year. The sector's strong earnings growth is despite the relatively flattish expectation fromApple(NASDAQ:AAPL-Free Report), with strong growth atAlphabet(NASDAQ:GOOGL-Free Report),Facebook(NASDAQ:FB-Free Report) and easy comparisons atMicron(NASDAQ:MU-Free Report) as big contributors.Earnings growth for the Finance, Basic Materials and Industrials sectors are expected to be in mid-single digits while the Energy sector moves from a modest loss in the year-earlier period to improving positive earnings this quarter. The aggregate dollar amount of earnings improvement is the highest for the Energy sector of all 16 Zacks sectors, with the sector expected to earn a total of $8.5 billion in Q1 vs. a loss -1.6 billion in the year-earlier quarter.Please note that we have yet to see any 'Trump bump' in estimates along the lines of what we have been seeing in the market since November 8th. The sole exception to that comment would be the Finance sector whose earnings outlook has benefited from the post-election uptrend in interest rates.Note: Sheraz Mian manages the Zacks equity research   department.

Ericsson to Power Sasktel's Next Generation IPTV Service;3/30/2017;"EricssonERIChas secured a contract to power SaskTel's next generation IPTV service. The implementation of Ericsson's MediaFirst solution suite will begin this year, with SaskTel planning to commercially launch its enhanced and expanded IPTV service in Saskatchewan in early 2018.As the dominant information and communications technology provider in Saskatchewan, Canada, Ericsson MediaFirst will enable SaskTel to offer subscribers new features over a new Pay TV in-home and TV everywhere product. These features include a highly personalized interface across all screens, and will offer users the ability to watch live TV and access content on demand on any device. They will also be made available to the existing maxTV subscribers.Under its end-to-end MediaFirst solution suite, Ericsson offers Ericsson MediaFirst TV Platform, Video Processing, Video Delivery and Video Storage and Processing Platform. Ericsson MediaFirst TV Platform is a ""software-defined, media-optimized cloud-based TV platform.""Over time, Ericsson has been taking strategic steps to fortify its foothold in the broadcasting and media industry, by extending its technology to broadcasters for merging video and mobility. In the past year, the company entered into multiple contracts - including Liberty Global's operating unit, Liberty Global and Belgian telecommunication player, Proximus - to boost their Digital Video Recording services.Ericsson further partnered with Alphabet Inc.GOOGLto extend the reach of its cloud-based MediaFirst TV Platform into the Android TV ecosystem, Google's operating system for the set-top box. The company has a proven track record, delivering TV and media business transformation for over two decades. Currently, it distributes four million hours of programming in more than 60 languages for over 500 TV channels.Ericsson's share price had a disastrous run on the bourse in 2016, as it plunged 39.3%, far wider than the ZacksWireless Equipmentindustry's average negative return of 7.7%. However, since then, the company has managed to recoup some of those losses, having appreciated 12.1% so far in 2017, in stark contrast to the industry's average decline of 2.6%.Earlier this week, Ericsson revealed a comprehensive restructuring plan to cut costs and streamline its focus areas, as well as explore options for the company's media business.The company expects to take provisions, write-downs and restructuring charges this year, with most of them being booked in the first quarter. Ericsson also has plans to prune its TV/Media business to enhance profitability.Whether these steps will allow Ericsson to jump back on the growth track, remains to be seen. However, as of now, we have a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) on the stock, as we are apprehensive over the impact of the restructuring on the company's profits and share price in the near term.The stock has also attracted some negative analyst attention, of late. Over the past month, analysts have become somewhat bearish on the stock, with estimates moving south. With one downward revisions compared with none upward in the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2017 has declined 3.3% to 29 cents.Ericsson Price and ConsensusEricsson Price and Consensus|Ericsson QuoteStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the same space includeMotorola Solutions, Inc.MSIand Ubiquiti Networks, Inc.UBNT, both holding a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

As the online advertising race     betweenAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG)  andFacebook(NASDAQ: FB) intensifies, the internet giant has no choice but     to address the issue quickly.To wrap up the show, the team also answers a listener     question for Canadian investors before discussing the state of     March Madness.A full transcript follows the video.makeArticleAd();10 stocks we like better than Wal-MartWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a       stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter       they have run for over a decade, the Motley Fool Stock       Advisor, has tripled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are theten best stocksfor investors to buy right now... and Wal-Mart wasn't       one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks       are even better buys.Click hereto learn about these picks!*Stock Advisor returns as of March 6, 2017The author(s) may have a position in any stocks         mentioned.This video was recorded on March 27, 2017.Chris Hill:It's Monday, March 27th. Welcome toMarket Foolery.I'm Chris Hill. Joining me in studio today, fromMillion Dollar Portfolio, Jason Moser; and fromStock Advisor Canada, Taylor Muckerman. Happy Monday!Jason Moser:Hey, now!Taylor Muckerman:We're doing it!Hill:We are doing it. Welcome back! You've been busy.Muckerman:Yeah, a couple weeks. You were at South by Southwest.     We've been overlapping each other.Hill:There we go. It's good to have you back in the studio.Muckerman:It's good to be back.Hill:We're going to dip into the Fool mailbag. We have to start     with a story that's been brewing for a little while. I'll     be honest. This is a story, I saw a headline on this a     week or two ago, and it registered like, huh,     that's interesting, and it continues to balloon. This is     the fact that a week ago, Google formally     apologized for running customer's ads alongside     objectionable videos. We've talked before about YouTube     and how important it is in the world of search, and how it's     one of the most popular places to search. And you see     these stories about, if YouTube was a stand-alone company,     it'd be worth somewhere in the neighborhood of $75     billion. Google makes this apology a week ago, and here we     are a week later, and I guess, among other things,     Jason, probably a reminder that YouTube is a really     big place with lots of videos, and therefore it's hard even for     the owners to monitor it.The Wall Street Journalhad this big story about howCoca-Cola,Microsoft,Amazon,Procter & Gamble, these mainstream brands, are still seeing their ads alongside     videos with racist content, anti-Semitic, all of this     stuff where the advertisers, rightfully so, say, ""I don't want     my ads next to that.""Moser:Yeah. We're going to hit a point here, sooner or later, it's     going to be like you do with your kids, they can saysorryonly so many times before you're like, ""I get that you're     sorry. Just don't do it again. I'm not looking forsorryanymore."" So, I think with Google and YouTube, this is     obviously something that's a big deal. It's not something that     immediately impacts their bottom line. When we talk about the     bread and butter for Google's money-making machine, it's search     advertising. But, there's a good percentage, close to 20% of     that money, comes through advertising with third-party     customers. So, when ads go next to objectionable content, of     course, those parties are going to express concern, they want     to know what's going on, why is this happening, and what are     you going to do to make it stop? Because there is no middle     ground here. It's just, flat-out, ""This     is unacceptable, don't let it happen anymore."" This     is sort of one of those things with this age of automation, as     we go more toward automating everything, particularly on     the consumer-facing side, I think it's really difficult to     ever fall back on the old, ""Well, the algorithm did it, it     wasn't our fault."" Because, ultimately, someone built     the algorithm.I think what Google needs to figure out here     is, what is happening to make this happen, and how do they     fix it? And whether it is through technology, whether it's     through humanizing it a little bit more, and actually bringing     on more people to add a human touch to these customer     relationships, they need to do something with this before     this gets out of hand.We've talked about this a lot, especially in MDP, we own     shares of Alphabet, and we own shares of Facebook: We     own a far larger position in Facebook, and part of the     reason for that is, when you look at the direction things are     headed in social, and in internet behavior, there's no question     that Facebook is becoming a place, not just Facebook, but     its properties, whether it's WhatsApp or Instagram     or whatever properties they buy in the future, that's a     place where eyeballs go to hang out for a while. Google is     more utilitarian in nature, right? You need some information,     you find it on Google, and you go to your next place. Facebook     is catching up very quickly. They've expressed some     concerns that perhaps the last decade was the Google     decade, and perhaps this next decade is the Facebook     decade. If that is the case, and the numbers certainly point     toward that, the argument could at least be made     there, Google has got to figure out something yesterday as     to how to address this and fix it, because blaming it on     the technology is not going to fly.Muckerman:I'm pretty confident that they're going to figure out a way to     fix it. Especially when you're talking about     Facebook, they had the whole issue around the election     with fake news on their site. And you had a group     of college kids come out and make an algorithm that was     able to identify fake news on the site, and they've been     able -- not using their algorithm, but, Facebook has been     able to address that. I'm confident that Google will. You talk     about big headlines about this, but I'm waiting for the     headline to come out that says, right now, people think that     less than 1% of Google's revenue is at risk because of this.     It's a $90 billion revenue company, I've seen headlines     that say $750 million might come off of YouTube's revenue in     2017 because of this. Bigger fraction of YouTube's     revenue, but you're not just an investor in YouTube when     you buy a stock in Alphabet. So, I'm still confident that     they'll figure it out. And between the two of them, Facebook     and Google, they're pretty much the only two that are growing     in the digital ad space. So, I find it hard to believe that     advertisers are going to completely move away from Google.     Right now, Facebook is really the only alternative, and     that space would become far too crowded too quickly if there     was a mass exodus from Google. I'm fairly confident that,     because you said 20% of their revenue comes from that search     advertising, they're going to figure this out.Hill:It is a small amount of money, and yet, when you look at the     headline ofPepsi,Starbucks,General Motors,Wal-Marthave pulled some of their ad spend with YouTube. Those     are big-name companies. I think, if you're     Facebook, you're not throwing a parade over this, but I     think if you're selling video advertising for Facebook, you're     on the phone to different media agencies, and I also think     television networks. If you're a broadcast network or     cable network, to use your phrase, Jason, you're putting     the human touch to work, and you're calling these companies and     saying, ""Listen, don't take a risk with the     programmatic algorithm approach to YouTube. You     know what you're going to get with our networks, and     you're going to get something that associates well with     your brand.""Muckerman:With some of those companies you mentioned, those are     companies that can afford to pull back for a week or two     on advertising and make a statement. That's     almost advertising in itself. They're still advertising     using Google's name, just not using Google's platform.     So, I think they'll come back eventually. Probably not too     far down the line. Those brands are brands already.     You're probably looking at the smaller     players, questioning whether or not they can afford to     back off of Google's platform a little bit more than Coke or     Pepsi.Moser:Yeah, and I think it's also worth noting, for the longest     time, YouTube has been synonymous with online video.     That's what got this ball rolling. And they've     enjoyed such a phenomenal competitive position for so     long. What an acquisition Google made for ... what did they buy     it for?Hill:$1.6 billion.Muckerman:Pennies on the current dollar.Hill:And the reason I remember it was $1.6 billion is     because I was one of the people saying, ""Boy, they sure     did pay a lot of money for that.""Moser:So, I think you fast forward today and you see how this     competitive environment has changed, Google and YouTube     are not the only players in the online video space.     And you see all sorts of companies, from Facebook andTwittertoVerizonandAT&Tdeveloping their online video offerings. To your point, I     think it's very easy to see these customers pulling back for a     week, a month, and saying, ""Hey, let's reasses what's going on     here."" Google and YouTube are too big to say, ""We don't want to     be a part of your environment."" That's just foregoing a     tremendous reach that anybody in their right     mind would want to be a part of. But, what it could do     is, it could result in some pricing competition. It can     certainly make Google have to get in there and compete a bit     more on pricing, lose a bit, perhaps, of that pricing     power, particularly as we ship to mobile, and we know     those mobile advertisements are not nearly as lucrative as the     desktops were, from a real estate perspective. But, these     are smart people running a very, very big company. The solution     to this really is as simple as, listen to your customers     and give them what they want. So, from that perspective, I     don't see any reason why they can't fix it. I guess it's going     to be interesting to see how they fix it, and how quickly     they go about fixing it, because they don't enjoy that same     competitive position that they enjoyed, perhaps, five years     ago.Hill:Our email address ismarketfoolery@fool.com. From Matt Saunders in Nestleton, Ontario. ""I     was hoping you could explain the effects of currency     exchange on stock purchases. I'm in Canada and our dollar     is quite low compared to the U.S. dollar. However, it     wasn't too many years ago, we peaked a little higher than the     U.S. dollar. My concern is that if I buy a     U.S. company at this point and the dollar rises again,     will that work against the value of the U.S. company that I     purchased? Or does buying on the TSX compensate for that     somehow? Thanks for all your help with this. P.S. please tell     Steve Broido, we just made a trip to Orlando and had     a great visit to an Olive Garden there. Definitely a fan.""     Steve will appreciate that, I'm sure.Muckerman:Yeah. Thanks for listening all the way from Ontario. This     was a question that we receive quite often inStock Advisor Canada,Pro Canada, and nowDividend Investor Canada. We put a special report about this a couple years back. Over     those couple years, not much has changed. Remain to see     the Canadian dollar still trading below the U.S.     dollar. I think right now, it's around $0.75 to the     U.S. dollar. As you did mention earlier in the 2000s, the     Canadian dollar did peak around $1.20 to the U.S. dollar. That     ramp-up really did cramp Canadian investors' returns when     you look at it, from investing in the U.S. dollar.     When the Canadian dollar does appreciate, you lose a     little bit there when you sell back into the Canadian     market. So, what we generally tell our members to do is,     A) we absolutely recommend investing in the U.S.     market, because when you look at the Canadian market,     about two-thirds of it relies on the energy, financials, and     the materials sector, two very volatile sectors, in the energy     and materials sector and then financials, really, the bulk of     that is driven by the big banks,TD,Scotia,CIBC,BMO, andRBC. They're very highly concentrated if you don't move     outside of the Canadian market. When you look at the     largest sector in the U.S., IT, I think that's around almost     22% of the S&P, it's 2.7% of the S&P TSX. So, you're     missing out on a lot of potential growth there. And less     than 1% of the S&P TSX is healthcare. If you think about     that, you're missing out on some huge potential growth     there. It was a little higher, butValeantobviously reduced the share of that overall     market when that fell precipitously over the last     couple years.But, the long-term average of the Canadian dollar to the     U.S. dollar is right around $0.85. There's about 13% upside     from where it is right now until it reaches the long-term     average, I think we have information going back to 1971 on     our site. That's over 30 to 40 years of data with the long-term     average of $0.85 to the U.S. dollar. So, you're not far away     from that. Compared to that $1.20 you saw in the early 2000s,     we view that as a one-off event, especially with oil where it     is these days, and the likelihood that remains subdued as     compared to when it was over $100, which, coincidentally,     timed very well with when it was peaking with the U.S. dollar     there. So, we advocate people considering the Canadian dollar     to the U.S. dollar exchange rate, but we don't say, ""Just     invest Canadian only."" Put some dollars into a separate     account, leave them there for the long-term so you don't have     to pay the cost to exchange back and forth, because banks do     charge for that. And you don't get charged if the company pays     you a U.S. dollar dividend and you leave it in U.S. dollars.     You don't get charged every time they deposit the dividend to     your account. You only get charged if you put it back     into CAD. So, if you're a long-term investor, we just say,     create two accounts, one with Canadian dollars and one with     U.S. dollars, and let it ride, because if you     don't, you're going to miss out on tons of opportunity.     TSX and TSX Venture stocks make up about 20% of the --Hill:Toronto Stock Exchange.Muckerman:Yep. They make up about 20% of the total     stocks available to you in U.S. markets. So, not only     are you missing out on diversification, but you're missing out     on opportunity, in terms of breadth of choices. So, don't let     the currency fluctuations scare you away from it. That's our     opinion.Hill:You've been to the Toronto Stock Exchange, haven't     you?Muckerman:Yeah, it's pretty cool. We went there a few years     ago, poked around when we were first launchingStock Advisor Canadain 2013. Been up there a couple times since, but     to not the same fanfare that we went up there a few years     back.Hill:Definitely a lot of fun. Fitting that I'm sitting with too     proud sons of the Carolinas because, for any sports fans     out there, the final four is set. We have Gonzaga, we have     the University of North Carolina, we have Oregon, and     we have, surprisingly, the University of South Carolina.     And the potential for an all-Carolina final.Moser:Amazing. If you think about it this way, you had Clemson     just win the National Championship in college football.     There is still the potential, certainly, for the Gamecocks to     go in there and win this thing in basketball. Which, I     mean, there's no way that's ever been achieved before.Muckerman:They have to win this, because the likelihood of a     potential rematch with North Carolina in the     final, highly unlikely. Although, this could boost     recruiting.Moser:About half of my graduating class in high school went to     USC. The other half --Hill:The other USC. Most people hear USC and they     think University of Southern California.Moser:The East Coast, South Carolina. The other half went the     Clemson. And I was the one lone straggler that went the     opposite direction and went to a 15-person liberal arts     college. Go, Wofford Terriers.Hill:Wait, isn't Wofford in North Carolina?Moser:Wofford is in South Carolina. You have Davidson that's in     North Carolina.Muckerman:Steph Curry.Moser:But, wow, the finish to that game yesterday was ...Muckerman:The Carolina game? Yeah, my gosh.Moser:Yeah, it was unbelievable. I have to believe that     right now, the Carolinas are figuring out a way to, perhaps,     join together, erase that border.Hill:There was a story I read this morning -- and, obviously,     there's so many millions of dollars involved in the     NCAA basketball tournament. But one of the stories I read     this morning was about the business impact in North and South     Carolina. And, not surprisingly, bars and restaurants     doing huge business over the weekend, and presumably will     do it again next weekend.Moser:That'd be like one of those things in an earnings report where,     that's one of those one-time events. So, when you're saying,     ""Well, we don't expect this next March, but we had a     very robust beginning of 2017, thanks to ... ""Hill:You're saying Jason's Barbecue and Sports Bar, in South     Carolina, when it's reporting earnings in the spring of     2018, it's like, ""Look, tough comp. Last year, we had the     final four. We had Clemson in the football championship.""Muckerman:Seriously. Clemson. USC has to catch up. Maybe think about     extending Tobacco Road a little for their South.Hill:I don't know how big the concentration ofBuffalo Wild Wingsis in the Carolinas but I do remember --Muckerman:There's quite a few.Hill:-- two years ago, when Tom Brady was first suspended by     the NFL, and he was going to miss four games, and this was     going into the fall of 2015, I do remember that on a conference     call, there was an analyst who asked CEO Sally Smith,     this analysts had the numbers and basically said,     ""Here's how many Buffalo Wild Wings locations are     in New England. Tom Brady is going to miss,"" and he     ended up appealing and not missing, but he missed the first     four of this most recent season, but -- and I give credit     to this analyst, he did his homework. It's just like,     ""Look, you have a bunch of Buffalo Wild Wings locations in     New England. The star quarterback of the home team is     going to miss the first four games. Are you factoring that?""     Legit question.Moser:I guess my question here is, Oregon is withUnder Armour, too.Hill:Wait a minute, Oregon? No, that's aNike--Moser:Is Oregon Nike? OK. I was just thinking, I saw     something, I was looking at this headline,Oregon Signs Record-Breaking Apparel Deal With Under     Armour, and --Hill:Are you sure it's not Oregon State?Moser:No, it says Oregon.Hill:Because University of Oregon is Phil Knight's alma     mater.Muckerman:Their football field is Nike sole turf.Moser:I'm aware! Let's go in and confirm this, but this is back     from 2014, but Oregon signs record-breaking apparel deal with     Under Armour. The deal was announced just hours after Phil     Knight announced he would no longer allow Nike to be associated     with Oregon, citing his frustration with a lack of     national championships.Muckerman:This isn'tThe Onion?Moser:No, this is SB Nation. [laughs] I guess Phil     Knight got sick of a bunch of losers! And he decided to     bag it. If that's the case, how interesting that you would     then have two representatives of Under Armour and two of     Nike.Muckerman:So, Gonzaga and Carolina obviously --Moser:Carolina is Nike, and I think Gonzaga is too. Oregon is the one     I was questioning, because South Carolina is definitely     Under Armour, and I think Oregon is, too.Muckerman:Michael Jordan hasn't eschewed Carolina just yet, I     guess.Moser:That's pretty cool.Hill:Yes. And the University of Oregon women's team is     in the regional final that's being played tonight. They're     playing UConn.Muckerman:I'm so sorry for them.Moser:Right, I was going to say, why don't they just hand them     the trophy? It's Connecticut, can they really ...Hill:You know what? That's what amazing Cinderella stories are made     out of.Moser:At some point, everybody thought Kentucky was going to     win, but Wisconsin, was it Wisconsin?Hill:Yeah, back in the day, a couple years ago. Look, if     Goliath was undefeated, where's the fun in that? We need David     to knock off Goliath every once in awhile. So who knows? The     lady Ducks might get it done against UConn.Muckerman:Lady Ducks and the Gamecocks.Hill:That's your lead story, by the way, if the UConn     women don't end up winning the national championship. All     right, Jason Moser, Taylor Muckerman thanks for being     here, guys.Muckerman:Cheers!Moser:Thank you!Hill:As always, people on the program may have interests     in the stocks they talk about, and The Motley Fool may     have recommendations for or against, so don't buy or     sell stocks based solely on what you hear.

Did Snap Win Gold With $75 Million NBC Winter Olympics Deal?;3/29/2017;"Snapchat's parent company Snap Inc.SNAPjust landed a massive content deal with NBCUniversal for the 2018 Winter Olympics. But what does it mean for the struggling social media app?The Wall Street Journalfirstreported that the dealis worth an estimated $50 million to $75 million based on advertising commitments in the first quarter of 2018. As part of the deal, NBC, owned by Comcast Corp.CMCSA, will sell for the first time Olympic-based Snapchat geofilters and ""lenses"" to advertisers.Snap's stock went up 1.53% to $22.55 per share on Wednesday, before falling slighting in after-hours trading. Snap is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (HOLD).The new NBC and Snap deal is the second recent and major partnership between the two companies. NBC joined forces with Snapchat to help enhance and expand its Rio 2016 coverage in August. NBC also invested $500 million in Snap's March IPO.But does NBC's second Snapchat Olympic deal signal something bigger for the disappearing messaging company?Real Player Going Forward?Snapchat owns the audience that NBC desperately wants to profit from, the coveted 35 and under demographic. Snapchat makes almost all of its money from advertising, so any deal that could land the company $75 million in just over two weeks isn't a bad thing.Comcast paid$4.38 billionfor the U.S. media rights to the four Olympics between 2014 and 2020. NBC then doubled-down and paid $7.65 billion for the rights to broadcast the Olympics through 2032, so the money Snap could see in 2018 is relative peanuts in NBC's grand scheme. Still, it is a solid step forward for the relatively new social media company.NBC lost Olympic viewers for the first time since 2000 this past summer in Rio. NBC drew an average of 25.4 million viewers on its prime time Brazilian coverage. London 2012 drew 31.1 million prime time viewers, according to an NBC release.NBC is fighting to gain as many eyes as possible for its 2018 coverage, and Snapchat helps the cause. According to NBC, nearly 35 million people in the U.S. viewed NBC's Rio coverage on Snapchat.Pyeongchang, South Korea is scheduled to host the 2018 Winter Olympics Games. The Winter Olympics are always less popular overall than its summer counterpart. Still, the Olympics are arguably the biggest and most important television rights deal NBC owns. The prestigious NBC Olympic exposure can't hurt Snapchat.Snapchat will share NBC Olympic content in an NBC Snapchat live story, which will also feature user-generated content live from South Korea. Similar to its Rio deal, BuzzFeed will help NBC produce content that will be posted throughout the games in Snapchat's Discover feature.NBC will sell ad slots that are spaced throughout its Snapchat Olympic coverage. They will also be able to sell branded geofilters and lenses.In Snapchat's fight against Facebook Inc.FBand Alphabet Inc.s' GoogleGOOGLfor online and mobile advertising revenue, every dollar counts. Snapchat's second massive NBC Olympic deal certainly helps the company not only gain more always-needed ad revenue, but it helps further legitimize the social media company with such high faith from a legacy media powerhouse.More Stock News: 8 Companies Verge on Apple-Like   RunDid you miss Apple's 9X stock explosion after they launched their iPhone in 2007?

Top Research Reports for Alphabet, 3M and P&G;3/29/2017;"makeZacksArticleAd();Wednesday, March 29, 2017Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Alphabet (GOOGL), 3M (MMM), and Procter & Gamble (PG). You can see all of today's research reportshere >>>Buy ratedAlphabetshares led the Zacks Tech sector at the start of the year, but have consistently underperformed the Tech sector since the weaker than expected quarterly report on January 26th (the stock is up +7.3% in the year-to-date period vs. +9.7% for the Tech sector. The stock responds strongly to quarterly earnings reports and has been weak following the last two reports, so expectations are likely modest ahead of the April 27th earnings release. The Zacks analyst points out the company's good execution to date, more or less maintaining its dominant share in a competitive, fast-growing search market. The company's focus on innovation, strategic acquisitions and Android OS should continue to generate strong cash flows. However, the promise of Google's non-search businesses continue getting pushed into future even as the company's spending keeps rising. (You canread the full research report onAlphabet here >>)Shares of Buy rated3Mhave gained +8.4% over the last six months, outperforming the Zacks Diversified Operations industry, which has gained +5.7% over the same period. The Zacks analyst likes 3M's global footprint, diversified product portfolio and ability to penetrate different markets. During 2016-2020, 3M expects 8-11% growth in earnings per share driven by an organic sales growth of 2-5%. 3M is standardizing its business processes through a new, global ERP system and expects $500 to $700 million in annual operational savings by 2020. The company has offered a relatively healthy guidance for 2017 and expects GAAP earnings to be $8.45-$8.80 per share, representing year-over-year growth of 4-8%. However, the company is facing increased pension expenses as its workforce begins to retire. In addition, the company is susceptible to high commodity price risks. (You canread the full research report on 3M here >>)Procter & Gambleshares outperformed the Zacks Consumer Staples sector in the past year (+9.8% vs. +3.5%) on the back of improved organic sales and improving margins as a result of productivity gains and cost-saving efforts. Also, P&G shares have outperformed the S&P 500 index in the year-to-date period (up +7.9% vs +5.3%). P&G's quarterly results exceeded expectations. On the flip side, the Zacks analyst points to mature end markets and the negative impact of the strong U.S. dollar as some of the headwinds for the stock. Also, flat pricing/mix is reflective of increased competition and lack of transformational innovation. The company also lost global market share in three of its five reporting segments.

However, rate hike is a concern for the company having high exposure to long-term leased assets.RCM Holds Promise, Competition Hurts Cerner's (CERN)GrowthThe Zacks analyst believes that Cerner has growth opportunities in the revenue Revenue Cycle Management (RCM) suite of solutions.Stanley Black (SWK) Poised to Grow on Inorganic ActivitiesStanley Black hiked its 2017-earnings guidance, driven by earnings accretions expected from Newell Tools and Craftsman Brand buyouts.New UpgradesPhilip Morris (PM) Invests on Heatsticks; Raises FY ViewThe Zacks analyst thinks Philip Morris' focus on Heatsticks is reflected by an investment of ???300 million for a manufacturing plant for IQOS. It raised fiscal 2017 view to reflect lower currency woes.Quest Diagnostics (DGX) Grows Solid on Tests & Latest Tie-UpThe covering analyst is bullish about Quest's strong growth in esoteric testing, prescription drug monitoring and wellness business. Its latest tie-Up with Ancestry and IBM is also a positiveBaker Hughes' (BHI) Solid Portfolio to Fuel GrowthThe Zacks analyst believes that Baker Hughes' strong portfolio of products and services should help it post better-than-average results over the long term in North America.New DowngradesFord (F) Downgraded on Weak First-Quarter GuidanceFord provided weak guidance for first-quarter 2017. The Zacks analyst thinks the company faces many concerns including regional challenges, increasing costs and recalls, and high investment plans.Arthur J. Gallagher's (AJG) Rising Expenses Remain a ConcernThe covering analyst thinks that Arthur J. Gallagher's rising expenses will continue to have a negative impact on the operating margin.

Domino's (DPZ) Robot Delivery Expands to Europe;3/29/2017;"Domino's Pizza Inc.DPZis expanding its robot delivery service to Europe. The recognized world leader in pizza delivery is teaming up with the London-based startup, Starship Technologies, to deliver pizza in Germany and the Netherlands with robots.This isn't the first time that a robot has delivered Domino's pizzas. The company has formed a group called Domino's Robotic Unit (DRU) to oversee this operation.  The first successful robot pizza delivery was done last March in New Zealand. It also made a delivery by drone in November.Starship, founded by two Skype co-founders, Ahti Heinla and Janus Friis, created six-wheeled, self-driving delivery robots that will be able to deliver pizza within a one-mile radius of certain Domino's pizza shops in selected German cities and locations throughout the Netherlands.The robot has a maximum speed of four miles per hour and able to carry up to 20 pounds. Known as DRU, it is designed to travel on the sidewalk and capable of detecting and avoiding obstacles, such as cars, trash cans, and curious bystanders.The public wonders if the robots will eventually take the job of the delivery drivers. The company said the robot is only a ""complement to its deliveries in cars and bicycles,"" and it will create more jobs for humans too, including maintaining the robots and loading pizzas into DRU.""With our growth plans over the next five to 10 years, we simply won't have enough delivery drivers if we do not look to add to our fleet through initiatives such as this,"" said Domino's CEO Don Meij.While the robot will only unlock with a code that customers receive through text, it's hard not to wonder if a hungry bystander will just follow the robot till its destination before striking or just hijacking the robot. What will Domino's and Starship do to prevent that from happening?Companies like Amazon.comAMZN, Wal-MartWMT, ChipotleCMGand AlphabetGOOGLhave all been testing out their version of drone delivery, but a lot of work in safety and policy still needs to be done.Domino's is trading at $183.93 per share, down 0.55% on Wednesday.More Stock News: 8 Companies Verge on Apple-Like   RunDid you miss Apple's 9X stock explosion after they launched their iPhone in 2007?

Samsung (SSNLF) Introduces the Galaxy S8 With Infinity Display;3/29/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThis morning in New York,Samsung Electronics Co Ltd(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) held its most important Samsung Unpacked event to date. This one was for the launch of the Galaxy S8, the company's flagship smartphone. This is a make-or-break moment for Samsung - at least where it comes to its position as the world's biggest smartphone maker.makeArticleAd();Source: SamsungThis is the time where Samsung has to convince consumers to forget about the Galaxy Note 7, exploding battery and all.The Galaxy S8 is the phone that will take onApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) and its 10th anniversary iPhone 8 (oriPhone Edition). And it has to hold offAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) and itsGoogle PixelPhone. In other words, there's a lot riding on the Galaxy S8.Here's everything you need to know about Samsung's most important smartphone, ever.Galaxy S8: Near Bezel-Free Infinity Display, No Home ButtonApple isn't the only one working tobanish bezels and buttonsfrom its phones. Samsung had the same idea and this year it's taken big steps in that direction. Its new Galaxy flagship has no side bezels - just screen right to the curved edge - and its greatly reduced them at the top and bottom. It calls this the Infinity Display - a nameDellsort of already coined with its XPS 13 laptop.This requires a pressure-sensitive virtual home button located beneath the display, and moving the fingerprint scanner to the back. The hardware buttons along the edges do remain, resulting in a huge display housed within a relatively small form factor. Although, adding vertical space has resulted in a ""stretched"" aspect ratio. Samsung does note it has worked with Google to ensure that extra screen real estate gets used. The display isn't just big, it's sharp and is the first to get mobile HDR certification.Two SizesThe Galaxy S8 comes in two sizes. This time the Galaxy S8+ features the same design as its smaller sibling (unlike last year where the larger model got a curved Edge display), built around the Infinity Display. With that new design, the plus model offers a whopping 6.2-inch display, while even the standard Galaxy S8 has a 5.8-inch screen - without getting cumbersome (thanks to minimizing the bezels).The 7 WORST Stocks to Buy Right NowIn comparison, the iPhone 7 Plus display is 5.5-inches.Bixby to Take on Siri and Google AssistantAI-powered virtual assistants have become key features on smartphones. Apple has Siri and Android has Google Assistant - although Google did keep that as a Pixel Phone exclusive for a few months.Likely in response to that Google exclusivity move, last fallSamsung bought Viv, an AI startup from the creators of Siri. That acquisition paid off with Bixby, Samsung's own AI agent. Samsung considers Bixby important enough that the companypreviewed the technologya week before the Galaxy S8 launch, and also gave Bixby a dedicated button on the new Galaxy smartphone.Where Siri and Google Assistant are focused on answering questions and helping users to accomplish tasks, Bixby does this to an extent, but is currently positioned more as a helper to make using supported applications easier.Key Galaxy S8 SpecsAs is expected with a new generation of a smartphone, the new Galaxy receives significant hardware upgrades, including a snappy new CPU.Quad HD+ Super AMOLED Infinity Display with HDR support (5.8-inches and 6.2-inches)Qualcomm, Inc.(NASDAQ:QCOM) Snapdragon 835 CPU with 4GB RAM64GB storage, expandable using microSD cards12-MP dual-pixel primary camera, 8-MP front cameraFace recognition securityIris scanner biometric securityIP 68 dust and water resistant3000mAh battery (3500mAh for S8+) with fast chargingGigabit LTE and Gigabit Wi-Fi readyUSB-C3.5mm audio jackWireless charging optionalOptional DeX dock for use with keyboard and monitorSamsung Pay, Samsung Pass supportHigh performance, $99 ear-buds tuned by Harman includedWeigh 5.3 ounces andAvailable in black sky, orchid gray, arctic silver, coral blue, maple goldSamsung ConnectSamsung is making a play for the smart home. Samsung Connect is a take on Apple's iOS Home app - and like Siri, Bixby can use it to control your smart devices by voice. But while Apple dropped out of the router business, Samsung is introducing its own, the Samsung Connect Home mesh router.Pricing and AvailabilityYou've seen Samsung's new flagship smartphone and it looks pretty impressive. But how much does it cost? And when can you get your hands on one?The Galaxy S8 goes for $750, while the Galaxy S8+ will set you back $850 (carriers may sell for less). Both models are available for pre-order starting March 30, and will go on sale beginning April 21. Samsung will also be selling a new, improved Gear VR headset and controller (free with pre-orders) and a new version of its Gear 360 VR camera.Is the New Galaxy S8 Good Enough?The big question, of course, is whether the new Galaxy S8 is good enough: Good enough to take on Google's smartphone ambitions with its Pixel Phone; good enough to hold its own against the iPhone 8; and perhaps most importantly, good enough tofinallyput the Galaxy Note 7 behind it.Apple Inc. Stock Hits Another Record High: How Much Further Can AAPL Run?We should have a good idea once SSNLF releases Galaxy S8 launch sales numbers. But based on what we saw at today's Samsung Unpacked event, the company has a real shot at staging a smartphone comeback.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace7 Stocks That Will Hit All-Time Lows in 20174 Famous Tech Stocks That Could Lose Their FangsThe postSamsung (SSNLF) Introduces the Galaxy S8 With Infinity Displayappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Will Someone Intercept Thursday Night Football From Twitter?;3/29/2017;"Last year,Twitter(NYSE:TWTR) made a big splash when it won the rights to stream 10 of the   NFL's Thursday Night Football games. The social network quickly   sold all of its ad inventory for the games, and it was immensely   profitable for the company (if at a relatively small scale).   Twitter reportedly sought to bring in $50 million in ad revenue   from its content partnership with the NFL, and probably exceeded   its goal. Considering it paid just $10 million for the streaming   rights, that's a good deal.But there's no guarantee the NFL will renew its deal with   Twitter. Other big tech companies likeFacebook(NASDAQ: FB) ,Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) andAlphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google are also reportedly   interested in the rights as well. Let's take a look at what   Thursday Night Football might mean to each interested   company.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();TwitterTwitter knows what it's getting with the NFL and the NFL knows   what it's getting with Twitter. Twitter has a relatively broad   established global audience that already talks a lot about sports   on its social network. Last year's results show that at least a   few of them are willing to stream the game on the same platform   they go to talk about it.But Twitter's viewership numbers may have been a bit   disappointing, particularly for advertisers. Twitter averaged   just200,000 to 300,000 viewers per gameon average. Twitter prefers to point to the 3.5 million unique   viewers per game on average, but the television ratings standard   use average audience. By comparison, the television broadcasts   consistently had over 10 million viewers and even topped 20   million viewers on occasion.Those ratings are noteworthy because marketers paid quite a   bit for Twitter's ads -- around $250,000 for a package of 20 ads   during the games and some pre-roll ads on NFL highlights. That's   nearly half of what advertisers paid for the television   broadcasts to reach an audience about 2% the size. Twitter is   switching toguaranteed viewershipon some video ads, so the NFL deal might not be as lucrative for   Twitter this time around.FacebookFacebook offers similar benefits to the NFL as Twitter, but it   has a scale that's five times larger. While Twitter is generally   considered the place to discuss live sports events, Facebook   still has the potential to attract a much broader and engaged   audience. Facebook boasts that its users spend 50 minutes per day   on average across Facebook, Instagram, and Messenger. With a   broad portfolio of apps, Facebook should be able to promote and   attract a much bigger audience than Twitter.A deal with the NFL could help Facebook seed its dedicated   video section. The company is interested in paying for premium   video content to attract users to watch and upload more video to   the social network. Facebook is also testing midroll video ads to   directly monetize videos on its platform, and Thursday Night   Football could provide a nice playground for the ad format.AmazonWhile Amazon doesn't sport the same audience as Facebook or   even Twitter, it's certainly willing to pay up for the NFL   streaming rights. In fact, it offered $15 million for the rights   last year, $5 million more than Twitter ended up paying. The NFL   ended up going with Twitter for its ability to reach a global   audience.But things have changed at Amazon over the last year. Most   notably, Amazon expanded Prime Video globally in December. It's   also been negotiating for the rights to stream sports that are   less popular in the U.S., but very popular internationally like   auto racing and soccer. If Amazon can put together a package of   sports rights for its international subscribers, becoming a   destination to stream games, it could convince the NFL to take a   shot with it.Of course, the NFL will likely stipulate that Amazon stream   the games to everyone, not just Prime subscribers. Nonetheless,   Amazon could use it as a marketing tool for Prime Video as well   as way to grow itsburgeoning advertising business.YouTubeYouTube is currently facing some backlash for placing ads next   to objectionable content. A deal with the NFL could provide a   boost to YouTube's reputation as a place for premium digital   video content. At the same time, YouTube's current reputation   struggles could deter the NFL from making a deal in the first   place, as the league is very brand conscious.YouTube is making a play for more television ad dollars,   particularly with the impending release of YouTube Unplugged, its   over-the-top linear television service. The company will already   be selling television advertising for YouTube Unplugged, and it   could use Google's ad targeting data to maximize its ad revenue.   That factor will put it at the top of the list for its ability to   successfully monetize an investment in Thursday Night Football,   which could enable it to come in with the highest bid among the   companies in this article.Overall, each company has a lot to gain from winning the   rights to Thursday Night Football. Twitter certainly has the most   to lose if it doesn't win, considering analysts already expect a   decline in ad revenue this year. The NFL is expected to announce   a winner in the next month or so, since it announced the Twitter   deal last April.10 stocks we like better than TwitterWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Is Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) the Best FANG Stock to Buy?;3/29/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsA few weeks ago, I touched on the so-called ""FANG"" stocks. The acronym covers popular stocks likeFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB),Amazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN),Netflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX) andAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL) - formerly Google, making up the ""G."" But after delving into that from 10,000 feet, I wanted to jump specifically into GOOGL stock.makeArticleAd();I was very upbeat about Alphabet in the assessment. Despite the optimism, though, we suggested waiting for a pullback. In fact,our very words were:""At just a hair under all-time highs, now may not be the best time to buy. A retest of its 50-day moving average near $840 and a further decline to its 200-day moving average near $800 would offer better entry opportunities.""So with GOOGL stock stumbling of late, where does it leave us?According to the charts, right where we wanted.Alphabet's IssuesAlphabet's YouTube ran some controversial ads. Running alongside them, though, included ads fromMcDonald's Corporation(NYSE:MCD),AT&T Inc.(NYSE:T),Johnson & Johnson(NYSE:JNJ) and others.  As a result, many of these brands havepulled or suspendedtheir advertisements with the search and video giant. That sounds like bad news, and at least temporarily, it is.10 Clobbered Stocks to Buy That Are About to Get Red-HotThe news pushed Alphabet stock below its 50-day moving average for the first time since late-December. However, my first thought was immediately that if one didn't want to buy the stock immediately after the breach of the 50-day MA, they could wait until it hit the 100- or 200-day moving averages, or safer still, wait for a bounce.That's just what we've gotten.GOOGL stock has since rebounded off the 100-day and is now challenging its 50-day moving average. A breakthrough here would mean enormous things for the stock, including a push toward all-time highs.We took a look at Alphabet's technical aspects, but what about its fundamentals?What Makes GOOGL Stock Look So Good?When we sorted through the FANG stocks, Alphabet was our favorite in regards to fundamentals.First, consider its brand. There is no question who is the undisputed leader in search. There's a reason people don't say, ""I don't know, Bing it."" Or ""who knows, just Ask Jeeves."" Google is the king of search and until the internet dies, it's unlikely GOOGL will either.In fact, Alphabet's Google site is themost visited websitein the world. Interestingly enough, its YouTube property is ranked second. Even Google.co.in - the Google used in India - is ranked seventh in the world.Alphabet has a grip so strong it's unlikely it will ever be broken. For a long-term shareholder in GOOGL, that's money in the bank.As the quarters and years go by, Alphabet's core businesses will continue to line investors' pockets. Its consistency is attractive, but other bets look promising too.For better or for worse, Alphabet takes some chances known as ""moonshots."" Take for instance, the company's self-driving car business. Alphabet's been at this one for a long time. Renamed Waymo, the unit has been making breakthroughs, which is very promising in this suddenly strong growth market. Without moonshots,Waymowould have never been created. It's what makes Google, Google.However, these moonshots can be bad news when they don't pan out and cost too much money. The minds that started Google changed the internet forever. And while they're excellent product people, they didn't make for the best financial overseers.Bring in CFO Ruth Porat, and that changes. Porat leftMorgan Stanley(NYSE:MS) and joined Alphabet in May 2015. The stock, stagnant for a year, boomed 50% in the 18 months following her hire.Streaky earnings results were replaced with consistent beats. She tightened budgets in a way that curbed careless spending yet still gave teams the flexibility they needed. Alphabet now has better transparency with the Street as well as a share buyback.The Bottom Line for AlphabetPerhaps the best part of GOOGL stock is the valuation. While not cheap necessarily, the valuation is reasonable. Trading with a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 21, Alphabet is forecast to grow earnings 19.3% annually for the next five years.Apple Inc. Stock Hits Another Record High: How Much Further Can AAPL Run?Throw in expectations for ~18% and ~15.5% respective sales growth for this year and next, and Alphabet becomes even more attractive.With a stellar brand, reasonable current valuation, long-term growth and strong management, GOOGL is poised for success well into the future.Luckily, investors now have a chance to buy.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author ofFuture Blue Chips.

Why Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Stock Will Keep Jumping Higher;3/29/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsEarlier this month,Nvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA) announced the Jetson TX2, which is the latest iteration of the TX1, which NVDA describes as""the world's first supercomputer on a module.""The company designed the Jetson module as a tool to assist developers in advancing and creating new technology. Additionally, in partnership withMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT), Nvidia announced development of theHGX-1 Hyperscale GPU Accelerator, which promises improved performance and standardization for cloud-computing servers.makeArticleAd();Source: NvidiaThese tools will also serve NVDA stock investors (indirectly, of course), as they further the company's rise to the top of the AI industry ladder.Android Centraldescribed the Jetson TX2 best,saying:""The people who will build this technology of the future will need the tools to do so. In 2017, NVIDIA is doing its part, and the Jetson TX2 is the embodiment of this idea.""Simply put, the Jetson TX2 is a mini supercomputer that can process massive amounts of data on the spot, which can be a huge advantage for technology developers who would otherwise have had to upload all that data to an online server for cloud computing.10 Small-Cap Stocks That Could Double in the Next 3 MonthsWhat's more, NVDA's Jetson TX2 is capable of ""edge"" machine learning, a term that refers to the ability of the module to process, interpret and analyze data without the need to first upload it to the cloud, then download the resulting information and details. The TX2 has served its purpose quite successfully and it has helped Nvidia achieve its goal of simplifying developers' processes by reducing the number of steps required to garner important data.As far as the HGX-1, NVDAbelievesthat:The HGX-1 hyperscale GPU accelerator will do for AI cloud computing what the ATX standard did to make PCs pervasive today. It will enable cloud-service providers to easily adopt NVIDIA GPUs to meet surging demand for AI computing.More Iconic Brands Rely on NVDA Than You Might RealizeHistorically, Nvidia has been known for its industry-leading graphics cards. But, NVDA stock is much more than a computer GPU maker. Sure, the company still produces some of the most advanced GPUs that make hardcore gamers drool, but graphics processors are actually capable of much more.While high-end GPUs will, obviously, improve PC video quality and reduce or eliminate that annoying screen lag when you're playing a first-person shooter game, they're also used for a surprising number of non-visual applications.For instance,Alphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) andTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) use Nvidia GPU technology in the development of their respective driverless cars.Volkswagen AG (ADR)(OTCMKTS:VLKAY) andDaimler AG's(OTCMKTS:DDAIF) Audi brand have also been using Nvidia GPU units in their own driverless vehicle development projects.

But if you had to do it, they talk about 5 stocks you could buy if you've got a long-term time horizon.Stocks to Buy for the Next 5 Years1.Alphabet (GOOGL): Tracey likes it because of the growth in YouTube. YouTube is just 12 years old and its now beginning to really generate revenue, especially as it launches its own subscription services. Alphabet is nearly 20 years old and it's still generating nearly 20% revenue growth a year.2.CME Group (CME): It's expected to see double digit growth this year. The exchanges are big business and Kevin believes it's only going to get better. It already is producing trading volume records and commodities, which have been down in the dumps, are only just beginning to rebound.3.PacWest Bancorp (PACW)is a $6 billion midcap regional California bank. As the Fed raises interest rates, the banks will see a rise in earnings. Banks are where you want to be if growth is picking up in the economy.

Snap Stock: A Gimmick for Insiders to Cash In;3/28/2017;"Snap Inc.SNAP, the parent company of picture messaging app Snapchat, was known to be the most exciting IPO of 2017. Since last October, when chat of a Snap IPO began, Wall Street created incredible buzz in anticipation of one of the largest tech IPOs in history.Co-founders Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy have grown Snap to be the social media giant it is today. When boldly declining buy-out offers from FacebookFBand GoogleGOOGL, Mr. Spiegel and Mr. Murphy knew they could grow their company to be worth a lot more than they were being offered. So they worked to expand and Snap now trades on the New York Stock Exchange at a $25 billion valuation.You might be thinking $25 billion is a tremendous value. Well, insiders of Snap might be cashing in more than you think.When digging into Snap's stock issuance, it seems that the affair has the ultimate and underlying value of making their insiders rich. Due to a deviance from a primary focus on shareholders, I call Snap's stock a gimmick.Peculiar Lock-Up Periods & Insider SellingLet's begin with the curious contingencies in Snap's lock-up periods: lock-up periods restrict shareholders from selling their positions for a certain amount of time. This allows newly public companies to manage volatility in their first days of trading. With a lock-up period, shareholders are forced to contemplate if they would like to hold their shares or cash in.Also, lock-up periods create a sentiment of confidence to the market. Large investors holding shares of a new publicly traded company shows the broader market that there is reason to buy and keep the stock.So, why are Snap's lock-up periods peculiar? Snap has expected some institutional investors to hold shares for an entire year. While lock-up periods are common, a year is quite the demand to fill. Snap has also reduced the lock-up period for its employees from the usual 180 days to 150 days.So what's happening here? Snap increased the amount of time institutions have to hold their stock and decreased the amount of time until their internal employees, the ones who know the company the best, can sell.But wait, it gets even more outlandish. Within days of Snap stock trading, upper management of Snap began releasing their shares to the open market. Mr. Spiegel and Mr. Murphy both sold 16 million of their shares for $17 apiece, cashing in for over a quarter billion dollars, each. On top of that, additional directors and officers of Snap sold millions of their shares to make an immediate profit off the market's sentiment of their company.If Snap really was doing incredibly well and has the potential that the market thinks, why wouldn't Snap's most influential faces hold the stock? Why wouldn't they show the market how confident they are in their company? Is the market more bullish than Snap's insiders?Zero Shareholder SayNo one in this world knows Snap better than the people who decided to immediately sell shares, and this should really open your eyes. What's happening is Snap's insiders are taking advantage of what the market has to say about them. After a dry year of IPOs in 2016, Snap was the next big thing after AlibabaBABAand Facebook. With that, insiders chose to exploit the opportunity and run to the bank.But let's try and look on the bright side. As insiders sell shares, they're giving away ownership of the company, right? This makes their votes have less weight when deciding on corporate activity? Wrong. Class A shareholders get absolutely zero votes. So not only are Snap's insiders able to take advantage, they are able to take advantage and not lose any control of the company.How is Snap able to get away with this? Let's put our feet in their shoes.You're an insider and just sold a heavy portion of shares within days of trading, to buy yourself another vacation home. How do you keep your company's stock from tanking? Require large investors to hold it for longer, as discussed above.  Also, work with the underwriting banks that took you public to issue great ratings for your stock.Biased Snap RatingsYesterday, banks which took Snap public, such as Goldman SachsGMand Morgan StanleyMS, released their ratings for the company as theirwaiting periods to release research ended. And what do you know? Most released a ""Buy"" or ""Hold"" recommendation.Although the first ""Buy"" ratings came before Snap's underwriters released their research, the majority sentiment leaned towards the sell side on Wall Street. After the release of Snap's underwriters' recommendations, the majority of analysts have now swung to the buy side.Again, let's take a step back to see what's happening here. The banks which took Snap public are issuing great ratings, which is an entire step away from the what most of Wall Street felt prior to their release.Did these brokerages really have any other choice? If they mostly issued ""Sell"" ratings, as the majority of Wall Street had, then the stock would immediately sell off and that would hurt their firm. And to kill two birds with one stone, issuing bullish ratings keeps the stock lifted as Snap's insiders sell.Closing ThoughtsSnap's stock issuance is rich in confusion. Activity seems to be backwards from what a traditional company would do to keep their shareholders in mind.When looking under the hood it seems Snap is overvalued in the market. Also, outlook seems shaky as Snap's professionals can't even hold their shares.I realize my above ideas may sound conspiracy like, but those were not my intentions. I hope to spark your ideas and thoughts in what may be happening behind the scenes of Wall Street, concerning Snap's stock. Regardless, it's a matter of time until we see Snap's true intentions of going public rise to the surface.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!makeArticleAd();It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

Verizon Teams Up with SES, 4K Content for FiOS TV Customers;3/28/2017;"As per a recentFierceCablereport, U.S. telecom behemothVerizon Communications Inc.VZhas collaborated with Luxembourg-based satellite operator, SES, to test the latter's Ultra High Definition (UHD) platform in order to deliver 4K content to its FiOS customers.  As part of the trial, SES will deliver nine 4K channels to Verizon's FiOS users: Fashion One 4K, Insight, Travelxp 4K, Nature Relaxation, C4K360, 4K Universe, UHD1, SES Demo Channel, and NASA TV UHD.The trial will eventually help Verizon offer the next generation of HD programming to FiOS TV customers throughout the U.S. and prepare for a wider 4K rollout in the near future.Reports also give us a sneak-peek about the launch of a new internet-based set-top box later this year, for the company's 4.5 million subscribers to better enjoy 4K content.Moreover, Verizon's FiOS' fiber network, with its adequate bandwidth, is apt for delivering 4K UHD to its customers. The collaborative agreement between SES and Verizon marks an important milestone in the development of Ultra HD solution.SES currently has trial agreements for its managed Ultra HD platform with Frontier Communications Corp.FTR. Verizon's FiOS TV rival-AT&T Inc.'sTDIRECTV is also well positioned, through their satellite delivered service. DIRECTV has already started delivering limited 4K contents.Meanwhile, on Mar 13, Verizon Communications faced a legal notice from the city of New York in relation to its FiOS rollout in the city. The company was accused of failing to meet the 3.3 million estimated services as committed in 2008.We hope Verizon will easily recover from its FiOS litigations in NYC. As a recovery to the loss, the company has assured completion of FiOS expansion to the city's remaining 1 million households over the next year. For this, the company will spend an additional $1 billion. So far, Verizon has spent $3.7 billion to deploy FiOS in New York City.We further look forward to seeing how this new offering of 4K channels to FiOS customers through a UHD trial along with FiOS' prepaid plans and free mobile data offering influence the stock's price performance, growth and financials (especially subscriber count) in the ongoing first quarter of 2017 and also in the future.The price performance of the stock is depressing. Over the past three months, the stock lost 8.0% compared with the Zacks categorizedWireless Nationalindustry's decline of 3.1%.Verizon currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Might Have a Chink in Its Armor;3/28/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOne of the key reasonsAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) - while it was still called Google - grew from nothing to an advertising behemoth in just a few years lies in the fact that much of what it offered was automated. Without the need for human intervention, it could cost-effectively offer ad space to advertisers with the click of a button (and payment, of course). This did wonders for GOOGL stock.makeArticleAd();Source:Brionv via Wikimedia (Modified)There does come a time, however, when a ""hands off"" approach to … well, pretty much everything can cause problems.Alphabet stock holders were made well aware of that reality just last week when a couple of advertisers suspended their ad spending at YouTube when it was realized their advertisements prefaced some distasteful hate speech that surfaced at the popular online video venue.In its defense, the company didn't know. As was noted, ad placements are essentially automated. On the other hand, it's arguable to say GOOGL should have known something like that could happen, and prevention measures should have been put in place. The debacle may force Alphabet to operate its advertising service with at least a little more human involvement.A Big Mistake for GOOGL Stock?Although several companies pulled the plug on their YouTube ads,AT&T Inc.(NYSE:T) andVerizon Communications Inc.(NYSE:VZ) were acouple of the bigger names that called it quits… at least for the time being.10 Clobbered Stocks to Buy That Are About to Get Red-HotThere was no specific event that prompted the boycotts, nor is it a brand new realization. But, the matter had been boiling over for a couple of weeks now, withan anti-Semitic clip video called ""Jewish World Order""serving as the poster child of how vile the digital video venue can be, and how damning the power of association can be to a brand.It's theoretically not supposed to happen. Aside from the fact that ads are intended to be targeted to a plausible potential customer, but knowing that automated filters aren't perfect, human judgment can also play a role in determining the appropriateness of an ad placement. Still, that's clearly not working either.Alphabet responded:""We don't comment on individual customers but as announced, we've begun an extensive review of our advertising policies and have made a public commitment to put in place changes that give brands more control over where their ads appear. We're also raising the bar for our ads policies to further safeguard our advertisers' brands.""It's the right thing to do, but a little too late.Impact on Alphabet StockAnd it's not just an embarrassing gaffe that will blow over, as most do. Nomura Instinet believes the advertiser boycott willshave $750 million off of the company's top line over the course of the remainder of 2017.That, however, isn't much in the grand scheme of things.YouTube wasprojected to drive $7.7 billion in revenuefor that three-quarter stretch. Alphabet has done $90.3 billion in revenue for the last four quarters. Of course, inasmuch as YouTube isn't profitable, the impact on the per-share profits of GOOGL stock may be nil.Not all analysts are convinced the high-profile flub is going to do any lasting damage, however. Morgan Stanley calculates that the affected part of the company's ad businessonly makes up 10% of the organization's revenue machine, and boasts millions of advertisers. RBC Capital's math follows up on Nomura's calculation, pointing out that even in the event of a 10% lull in that arm's revenue, it would still only translate into a 1.7% lull in total revenue.Bottom Line for GOOGL StockIt's still not clear what, if anything, Alphabet specifically intends to do about the miscue and the subsequent fallout. And the plausible fiscal impact of the damage done is little more than guesswork at this point. Those matters, however, may be secondary.Should You Buy T-Mobile US, Inc. (TMUS) Stock? 3 Pros, 3 ConsWhile Google may still be the king of search and display ads and GOOGL stock is still one of the top picks in the industry, this is another dent in the company's reputation - and its operation. The automated approach of pairing up ads and publishers was clever when it was the only option, but the whole business of internet advertising has changed. Alphabet stock didn't change enough with it.Case in point: Last year, an internet advertising arrangement called Header Bidding became all the rage.Facebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB)took that ball and ran with it … and customers love it. Rather than adapt on the future of digital display ads, GOOGL doubled down on its version of the ad-selling approach that distinctly lacks the transparency so many Header Bidding users love. Most observers expect Alphabet stock to lose market share as long as it refuses to face Facebook head-on.None of this means GOOGL stock is doomed, but between being lapped by Facebook and now clearly being unable to guarantee appropriate ad placements to its biggest customers, investors should start to ask some tough questions about Alphabet's sales and delivery model.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 Small-Cap Stocks That Could Double in the Next 3 MonthsThe 7 WORST Stocks to Buy Right NowThe postAlphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Might Have a Chink in Its Armorappeared first onInvestorPlace."

The company is planning to sell 10.5 million shares of common stock, and minus fees, hopes to raise $84 million at the bottom range to $105 million at the top of the range.Depending on how its IPO goes, Yext could see a valuation upwards of $870 million if shares are priced at the top end. The company's shares will trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol ""YEXT.""Yext is looking to be the next big tech offering following that of Snapchat parent Snap Inc.SNAP, whose blockbuster IPO rocked the market earlier this month.

Is Apple Looking to Expand in the Augmented Reality World?;3/28/2017;"Apple IncAAPLis accelerating its efforts in the AR space, reports The Financial Times. However, it adds that a retail launch is unlikely to happen in the near future.There have been quite a few rumors regarding Apple's AR efforts, as CEO Tim Cook has emphasized on developing the technology time and again in the last few months. Cook had reiterated the company's AR efforts for the first time at its third quarter fiscal 2016 earnings conference call. He has been quoted saying ""AR can be really great, and we have been and continue to invest a lot in this. We are high on AR for the long run. We think there are great things for customers and a great commercial opportunity."" In fact, he has been quoted by media reports saying not VR but AR will be ""the larger of the two, probably by far"".In November last year, Bloomberg stated that Apple was mulling over venturing into the wearable headsets space but is unlikely to initiate ""mass production"" as it has just ordered a small number of near-eye displays for testing purposes from a supplier. Bloomberg also claimed that if all goes well then AR glasses will wirelessly connect to an iPhone and will display information and images directly in front of the user's field of view.Moreover, in January this year, tech blogger, Robert Scoble, citing a Carl Zeiss employee, stated that Appleis working on AR/mixed reality headsets and has partnered with the renowned lens maker. He was more optimistic about retail launch as he stated that the glasses could hit stores as early as this year.Apple Inc. PriceApple Inc. Price|Apple Inc. QuoteHowever, Apple has refrained from commenting on any of these rumors. The company has a habit of maintaining secrecy regarding its new products.Apple is under tremendous pressure to introduce new offerings, as it's most important growth driver-the iPhone-faces decelerating demand. iPhone alone contributed about 70% of Apple's total revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.Better-than-expected iPhone 7 and 7 Plus sales have definitely come as a respite. But the macroeconomic headwinds remain for now, especially in China, one of its high-growth regions. Apple revenues declined around 12% year over year in the Greater China region to $16.2 billion. Also, competition from local players has been hindering iPhone's growth in this region. Slowdown in demand from key regions like China, if continued, can significantly impact Apple's financials going ahead.Apple has been exploring newer growth avenues to boost its topline. With so much buzz created by AR/VR and AI technologies, the company has started to focus on its development. These are fast emerging as lucrative business opportunities. According to a recent IDC report, global revenues of the AR/VR market are expected to grow at a CAGR of 181.3% from $5.2 billion in 2016 to over $162 billion in 2020.  Bloomberg, which quoted Global Market Insights figures, reported that the global market for AR products will surge 80% to $165 billion by 2024.Per Bloomberg, Apple has built a team combining people who have experience in working on Facebook'sFBOculus and Microsoft'sMSFTHoloLens. The company has also acquired several smaller firms with expertise in AR hardware, 3D gaming and virtual reality software. These include Flyby Media, Emotient, TupleJump, Turi, Metaio and PrimeSense.Not only Apple, but all tech giants-right from AlphabetGOOGL, Facebook to Microsoft-are scrambling to grab a share of this lucrative market. Facebook had acquired Oculus in 2012 to fuel the company's ambitious VR efforts. Moreover, media reports add that Facebook is likely to unveil four consumer hardware products at this year's F8. These include drones, brain scanning technology, AR and next gen cameras. In March 2016, Microsoft started shipping its AR headset, HoloLens.Zacks Rank & Stock Price MovementAt present, Apple carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Is Baidu Poised to Gain from Driverless Car Unit Spin Off?;3/28/2017;"Chinese search giantBaidu, Inc.BIDUappears to be waiting for its driverless car unit to grow a bit more before it spins it off. According to co-founder and CEO Robin Li,"" When we think business is promising enough and it has reached a stage that running it independently or introducing more strategic investors would make sense, we will do that.""Usually when a company spins off a unit, it's an indication of bigger plans. The autonomous car industry is attracting a lot of attention lately and more innovation is in the offing, both by the biggest tech players and automakers and by smaller startups.Notably, the company is developing an artificial intelligence platform that combines its cloud platform with NVIDIA's self-driving technology to deliver things like HD maps, vehicle control, automated parking, and others for the Chinese market.Baidu, Inc. Revenue (TTM)Baidu, Inc. Revenue (TTM)|Baidu, Inc. QuoteFactors that Tilt the Scales in Favor of a Spin   offAn independent, fully functional self-driving car company under Baidu will be more appealing to investors and partners. It could also help the company streamline operations and enhance focus on its core online advertising business that currently faces tough competition.Just like Alphabet'sGOOGLWaymo, Baidu does not plan to manufacture a self-driving car on its own. Rather, it will focus on building self-driving technology for established automakers. This is indicative of the fact that technology companies are reluctant to sit idle and wait for the regulatory environment to turn favorable. Rather they would sell technology and continue to grow their business.Year to date, Baidu has underperformed that ZacksInternet - Servicesindustry, gaining 2.7% compared with the industry's gain of 7.7%. We believe that some success in the driverless space could boost the company's stock price in the future.Raising Barriers to EntryWith this move, Baidu could also be gearing up to enter the ride sharing business in China currently dominated by AppleAAPLbacked Didi Chuxing.This would raise entry barriers in the Chinese driverless ride-hailing space. However, outside China, Baidu will face tough competition from Waymo, Uber and Ford Motor CompanyF.Baidu plans a commercial role out of its self driving technology by 2018 and expects mass production to start by 2021.Control and Competition to RemainThe autonomous vehicles space is currently one of the best places to be in as the technology is still under development. Also, early investors can sell their interest at a nice premium.

He describes the Snapchat parent company as ""venture stage investing in premium creative platform."" He explained that the recent trend among Internet companies over the last few years is to wait for ""later stages of growth and profitability"" before filing for their IPO.While he admits that buying into a firm that's in the venture capital stage comes with more risk than buying into one that's in later stages of growth, in Snap's case, he feels that the potential reward is greater than the risk.The company has 158 million daily active users who visit the site 18 times every day for a total of 30 minutes. While the initial reviewers of Snap expressed concern about the deceleration in daily active user growth, Terry said comScore data suggests that this metric reaccelerated in the fourth quarter when monthly active users grew 18 million compared to 12 million in the third quarter.This is a particularly interesting point as other analysts noted that the timing of Snap's deceleration in user growth was in line withFacebook Inc's (NASDAQ:FB) launch of products like Instagram Stories, which looks like a clone of Snapchat.Snap's Growth Will ContinueJefferies Group LLC(NYSE:JEFF) analyst Brian Fitzgerald initiate coverage of Snap stock with a Buy rating and $30 price target and said he doesn't feel the company's growth will disappear like the photos posted on Snapchat do. He feels that advertisers will ""clamor to serve ads to its large audience of deeply-engaged users, many of whom are in the attractive millennial demographic and are located in high-value ad markets.""He notes that the average revenue per user for the company's much bigger competitor Facebook is about nine times higher ($23.77 versus Snap's $2.70), but he expects Snap's average revenue per user to grow sharply and narrow that large gap. He feels that ARPU is Snap's main growth lever and its most likely source of upside to estimates.Fitzgerald also points out that the company's strategy is an asset-light one because it outsources its infrastructure costs toAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL) andAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN).9 Stocks to Buy That Are Growing Faster Than AmazonAs a result, it should be able to scale its platform without any big capital expenditures, a recent area of contention between Facebook and investors.Snap is a Top ""Innovation Machine""RBC Capital Marketsanalyst Mark Mahaney initiated coverage of Snap stock with an 'outperform' rating and $31 price target. He bills the Snapchat parent as ""an innovation leader"" in mobile for both advertisers and consumers. He even goes so far as to describe Snap as ""one of the best innovation machines on the 'net today.""Indeed, the company does deserve some credit for innovation, as some of its ideas have been so good that Facebook decided to clone them, adding its own small spin on products that otherwise look like Snapchatcopies.Mahaney describes Snap's innovation as ""extremely impressive"" and sees ""substantial growth opportunities"" in its current daily active user base and low ARPU. He also offered up Facebook and Twitter as examples of how Snap should be able to scale its profitability.William Blair analyst Ralp Schackart initiated coverage of Snap stock with an Outperform rating, also highlighting the young age of Snapchat's user base as a huge strength because advertisers struggle to reach this age cohort. More than half of Snapchat's users are between the ages of 13 and 24.Other Initiations of Snap StockNot every new analyst report on Snap stock this morning was fullybullish, as Stifel analyst Scott Devitt initiated coverage of Snap stock with a Hold rating and $24 price target. He sees a long monetization runway, but he feels that the current share price already reflects his level of optimism in the company's long-term growth opportunities.The Core of Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Is at RiskHe would become more constructive on the stock if it were to fall closer to $20 per share, although it doesn't look like that will happen any time soon, as investors are boosting shares thanks to this morning's flood of positive analyst coverage. Devitt would also see a better risk/ reward profile for Snap stock if the company ""materially"" beats consensus estimates in its first quarter earnings report.The postSnap Inc Stock And The Running Of The Bullsappeared first onValueWalk.Many academics claim investing is a ""random walk.""

3 Big Stock Charts for Tuesday: Alphabet Inc (GOOGL), Amgen, Inc. (AMGN) and United Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS);3/28/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsStocks look to start their climb higher this morning, though just slightly. All three of the major indices touched-up on their respective 50-day moving averages during trading yesterday to find some support. This is the first time that technicals have had to step in as support since December.makeArticleAd();The next two days will determine success or failure, so traders will spend their days trading both sides of the market for the rest of the week to see how this first test of 2017 plays out.Today's three big stock charts looks at the price musings ofUnited Parcel Service, Inc.(NYSE:UPS),Alphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) andAmgen, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMGN) as three stocks that are facing similarly critical tests of their technical standings.United Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS)The logistics/delivery company has been locked in a trading range since its disappointing earnings report dropped the shares by more than 10%. Now, after several tests of what has turned into critical chart support, UPS shares are testing $104 for support again.10 Clobbered Stocks to Buy That Are About to Get Red-HotThe level ($104) can be tracked back to April and May of 2016 as a significant support level, which is why the traders are keying some buying off it now.The touch of $104 comes while UPS shares are touching down on oversold readings from the stock's RSI. This indicates that the flow of selling pressure is likely to ebb and fewer buyers will be needed to change the momentum for the short-term.A break below $104 will target another 4% to 5% decline in the shares as $100 is the next clear line of support. According to our model, the stock remains in the short- and intermediate-term bearish category given the technical breakdowns and the declining 50-day moving average.Alphabet Inc (GOOGL)Alphabet shares have snapped lower over the last week and now reside in a technical ""rock and hard place"" situation.GOOGL stock sold out of an overbought situation as it hit $875 right through its first level of support drawn by its 50-day moving average at $843. Friday and Monday's additional selling pressure dropped Alphabet stock to test its 100-day moving average at $825. This is the second time that GOOGL shares have fallen against this trendline for support in as many months.Traders need to keep an eye on the trend of the 50-day moving average on Alphabet stock as it appears to be transitioning from a bullish ascending pattern to a neutral and potentially bearish declining trend. This will have a negative implication on the price target for GOOGL shares over the short-term outlook.For now, maintain an eye on $820, which represents the stock's 100-day moving average. A break below this will see Alphabet move into that short-term bearish pattern with an initial price target of $800.Amgen, Inc. (AMGN)Amgen shares continue to recover from the news that their newest cholesterol drug, Repatha, didn't trial as well as expected. AMGN stock has shed about 12% since that news took shares downs.It appears that much of the selling has been squeezed out of the market as the stock is landing close to technical support levels that should help to build a case for short-term bulls.First, Amgen shares entered an oversold position last week on the decline below $170. This called for a likely short-term bounce, which has yet to be seen.Why Bank of America Corp (BAC) Is Becoming a Tech StockSecond, while AMGN shares could slice through their 50-day moving averages, the stock still has two important technical lifelines.The 200-day moving average for Amgen shares is trading at $161 indicating potential support. This same price level has seen significant price support and resistance over the last six months, strengthening the argument that we will see buyers enter the market at this price.Finally, AMGN's 100-day moving average, which just transitioned into a bullish pattern itself, is bringing support at $157 in case Amgen can crack through $161.Bottom line for technical traders is that the headline effect of Repatha is likely wearing off and the technicals, which remains bullish, should bring AMGN stock back into its intermediate-term bullish climb.As of this writing, Johnson Research Group did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 Small-Cap Stocks That Could Double in the Next 3 MonthsThe 7 WORST Stocks to Buy Right NowThe post3 Big Stock Charts for Tuesday: Alphabet Inc (GOOGL), Amgen, Inc.

Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Owners, Put This on Your Radar;3/28/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhile nobody could deny thatFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) has been a smashing success, those FB stock holders who keep close tabs on the company's operations know all too well there will come a time when the company can't add new users at a breakneck clip, andcan't cram any more advertisements onto each member's page.makeArticleAd();Source:SilverIsdead Via FlickrWhat if, however, Facebook could come up with a way of selling ads outside of its flagship social networking site?Actually, it has been doing that for a while, though has struggled to make a dent in the North American display ad market, which is mostly owned byAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG), via Google. With a little help fromAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) and others though, Facebook is now positioned to take a bigger bite out of that pie.Facebook Rolls Out Header BiddingIt's not a description that does the idea justice, but it does set the stage - header bidding is a way a website operator, or ""publisher,"" can pick the display ad that pays the most for appearing on a particular web page.In the web's early days, it wasn't always clear to an advertiser if the ad space they were buying was worth it.7 Consumer Stocks That Will Lead Your PortfolioLikewise, it wasn't clear to a publisher if the ad space they were selling was the best price they could achieve. But, in that the communication of such information was poor, both parties relied on the middleman (usually Google) to do the best it could do, and keep a few pennies per impression for itself.A lot has changed since the dawn of display ads, though. Namely, not unlike a stock exchange, a buyer and seller of web ads can now see the market's best bid and offer.It's not exactly a new idea. Facebook announced it was developing this so-called Facebook Audience in August of last year. That was a soft launch though, and didn't include all of its possible partners that will provide the underlying technology. It wasn't until this week the product officially launched, with Amazon.com's header-bidding platform beingone of six ad networks participating, all competing for business.Google BewareWhile FB stock owners have good reason to be excited, Google is still Google, and is a force to be reckoned with. It won't go down easy.And yet, thus far it has not developed a weapon that it can effectively fend off the growing tide of header bidding. Its best response has been what it callsDynamic Allocation… a sort of hybrid of header bidding and its traditional ad-sales approach. Advertisers aren't impressed, however, saying it only benefits Alphabet.Sortable's Chris Reid opined last year that the advent of header bidding could drive Google's display ad market sharefrom 90% to something between 40% and 50%.Conversely, publishers participating in the early dry runs of its Audience Network program saw revenuegrow between 10% and 30%.With those metrics on the table, something explained last year in the wake of the soft launch ofFacebook's header bidding planswas very much on target:""Google is frankly very defensive because their position is being threatened. If you now amplify that by Facebook saying, 'Hey, wait a second, look, there's a chink in the armor. All these independent companies have found it, why don't we do the same thing and bring our wallet to bear?' We're actually going to start to see an event that could at a very, very substantial level check the Google monopoly.""Further threatening Google is the fact that Amazon and Facebook may be better equipped to build a profile of a particular user than Google is,delivering more targeted adsfrom one device to the next. In other words, based on a user's PC history, the network can deliver a specific ad to that user on his or her mobile device.Is Netflix, Inc. (NFLX) Stock Finally Ready to Break Out?Google's user profiles allow for highly targeted ads as well, though that aging approach may not be as refined and updated as the one offered by Audience Network.Bottom Line for FB StockThe ultimate impact the new version of Audience Network may have on the profitability of FB stock isn't perfectly clear. There is clearly an upside though, with little to no downside.To the extent guesses are being made though, observers are apt to be underestimating the benefit the new scheme will have. Google's size and disinterest in being competitive have given rise to the new competition Facebook is now supporting. Advertisers are already trying that ""something else"" besides Google, and liking the switch.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceThe 10 Best ETFs to Buy for the Rest of 20177 Consumer Stocks That Will Lead Your PortfolioThe postFacebook Inc (FB) Stock Owners, Put This on Your Radarappeared first onInvestorPlace."

China is Helping Baidu's AI Efforts, and it Couldn't Come at a Better Time;3/27/2017;"Chinese internet search leaderBaidu, Inc.(NASDAQ: BIDU) has made a name for itself as one of the leaders   in artificial intelligence (AI) in the world's most populous   country. It has made no secret about its excitement regarding the   prospects for the technology and has hired some of theforemost expertsin the field for high level positions within the company. Now, it   is getting the Chinese government seal of approval for its   trouble.The government agency in China responsible for planning   economic and social strategies will providean undisclosed amount of fundingto Baidu to develop a national laboratory committed to deep   learning, a specific discipline of AI. The ""lab"" will not be a   physical structure, but an online network of interconnected   researchers sharing data. Baidu will be joined by Tsinghua and   Beihang Universities and other academics from the Chinese Academy   of Sciences. The lab's initial focus will be in the areas of   computer vision, biometric identification, and human-computer   interaction.AI will transform industry after industry. Image source:     Pixabay.makeArticleAd();AI is the new electricityBaidu's CEO, Robin Li has been outspoken regarding his belief   regarding thepotential of AI. At the Baidu World Conference in 2016, he stated ""gone is the   era of PC, and soon will we say goodbye to the era of mobile   internet...We believe that coming is the era of artificial   intelligence, which to us is the Baidu Brain.""The Baidu Brain is an AI-based artificial neural network that   sorts through reams of data and can detect patterns. Baidu's   chief scientist Andrew Ng was a founding member of the team that   developed the Google Brain prior to his tenure at Baidu. He is   also an adjunct professor at Stanford University, where he taught   AI and has made similar statements concerning his belief that AI   will be transformational:I think that AI is a new superpower. AI is the new     electricity. Two hundred years ago there was no such thing as     electricity. You couldn't talk on phones, there was no electric     lighting, you couldn't have a refrigerator. About 100 years ago     as we started to build out electricity we saw that transformed     not just one industry but industry after industry. We think     that AI will similarly transform industry to industry. In that     sense it is a superpower.This neural network and others like it have led to   far-reaching developments in image recognition, natural language   processing, voice recognition, and user profiling. These in turn   have led to thedevelopmentofvirtual assistantsthat reside on most smartphones,smart home speaker systems, advances inmedical research, and eventools for cybersecurity.White House issues report on AI. Image source: Pixabay.Governments worldwide waking up to the potential of AIChina isn't the only country considering the future of AI. A   White Housereportissued in late December titledArtificial Intelligence, Automation, and the Economythat sought to determine the ""ways that artificial intelligence   will transform our economy over the coming years and decades.""   The initialreport,Preparing for the Future of Artificial Intelligence, revealed that the US government was spending $1.2 billion on AI   research last year and recommended tripling that amount.Last year, DeepMind, a division ofAlphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google revealed that itsAlphaGo AI systemdefeated South Korea's top ranked player at Go, an ancient   Chinese game whose complexity had stymied previous computer   attempts to master. South Korea subsequently announced a plan to   invest $863 million in AI research over the coming five years.   The UK has also announced its intention to invest 20 million   pounds in the areas of robotics and AI.Foolish final thoughtsThis may be the beginning of a new era of government backing   for AI. Boston Consulting Group estimates that AI will generate   between $100 billion and $120 billion in productivity gains by   2025. Just as big tech companies are racing to stake their claim   in this transformational science, so are governments afraid of   being left behind.The bump from the Chinese government couldn't come at a better   time for Baidu -- the company has been struggling to   re-energize its slowing growth and has been counting on AI to   provide the catalyst. Online marketing, which represents more   than 91% of the company's revenue, has fallen 8.2%  and   6.7%  year-over-year respectively, in its two most   recent quarters, and the customers base that produces that   revenue have fallen 18.6% and 15.9%. In the last year, the   company has spent 14% of its total revenue on research and   development expenses, and the majority of that has been on   AI.The company is banking on AI to reverse course, and now it has   some extra backing to do so.10 stocks we like better than BaiduWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock       tip, it can pay to listen.

The 3 Stocks With the Best Businesses We've Ever Seen;3/27/2017;"A great business is extremely difficult to disrupt.   Competition has the tendency to drive down profits, but a great   business can buck this trend. A competitive advantage isn't   enough; the best businesses havedurablecompetitive advantages, what Warren Buffett calls an economic   moat. Trying to beat a company with a moat isn't impossible, but   it's often not worth the cost.We asked three of our contributors to each discuss a company   that fits the above description. Here's whyMastercard(NYSE: MA) ,Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) , andWaste Management(NYSE: WM) are three of the best businesses, and the best stocks,   we've ever seen.A toll bridge on global commerceBrian Feroldi(Mastercard):While there are a lot of great business models in existence, I   must admit that Mastercard's is the one I most admire. Mastercard   plays a crucial role in connecting merchants, customers, and   financial institutions together to enable digital commerce. In   exchange for its services, Mastercard takes a small swipe off of   each transaction. With trillions of dollars flowing through its   network each year -- yes,trillions-- those small fees add up to the tune of more than $10 billion   in annual revenue.makeArticleAd();All that revenue is wonderful, but what I really love about   Mastercard's business is its operating leverage. In essence, this   means that Mastercard's costs are largely fixed, so processing   one more transaction costs the company next to nothing. Thus,   every additional transaction that the company can incentivize on   its network almost turns into pure profit. Since consumers have   been ditching cash and checks in favor of credit and debit cards   for years, Mastercard's profit margin has skyrocketed.MA Profit Margin (TTM)data byYCharts.Looking ahead, I see no reason for this trend to change. While   credit and debit cards are ubiquitous in developed markets, they   only represent 15% of global transactions. That suggests that   this company has decades of room left for revenue and profit   growth. If true, then Mastercard's stock stands a good chance at   continuing to thump the market from here. That's why I've made   this company one of my biggest personal holdings and have no   intention to sell my shares anytime soon.An incredible technology companyTim Green(Alphabet):The amount of cash that Alphabet's Google throws off is made even   more impressive by the fact that the company is still growing at   a double-digit rate. Revenue from Google grew by 20% in 2016 to   $89.5 billion, with the business producing operating income of   $27.9 billion. While Google does face threats, ranging from   social media companies likeFacebookto e-commerce giantAmazon, the company's products are so deeply embedded in people's lives   that upending its business model would be a herculean task.Google dominates search, leaving its competitors fighting over   the scraps. Products like Gmail, Maps, and the Chrome browser   have become the standards, giving Google a massive base of users.   Google's Android mobile operating system powers more than 85% of   all smartphones sold, and its Chromebooks now account for more   than half of all U.S. classroom devices sold. All of this feeds   into it advertising business and its cloud computing   business.Image source: Alphabet.The success of Google allows Alphabet to subsidize its moon   shots. From self-driving cars to internet access delivered via   balloons, Alphabet is betting billions that one of these   long-shot ideas will take off. Many will lead nowhere, but the   potential of each idea is enormous.Alphabet is one of the most successful companies in history,   and that success has been sustained by significant competitive   advantages. Even if none of Alphabet's moonshots pay off, the   company should continue to thrive well into the future.The best kind of business: The ones you use daily but     never even considerTyler Crowe(Waste Management):I think of some of the best businesses to be in are the   ones that we don't consider on a daily basis. Those   day-to-day tasks we take for granted and think nothing of paying   for the service. Is there anything that fits that description   better than handling our refuse? Companies that collect and   properly dispose of our trash are incredibly valuable services   that we barely notice. Behind the scenes, though, it is a   business that has more competitive advantages than one can count.   That's what makes Waste Management the kind of company that   leaves me in awe of its business model.The most obvious advantage a waste handling industry has is   geography and regulations. The ability to open up a new landfill   for proper waste disposal faces mountains of regulatory scrutiny   as well as the ""not in my backyard"" mentality of local   communities. So those companies that can get a landfill up and   running have near-monopolistic reign over a particular region. If   that weren't enough, it's extremely capital intense to build and   maintain a fleet of collection vehicles. These types of strategic   benefits keep competition low in specific regions and give   those operating in a particular community incredible pricing   power.For investors in Waste Management, it has translated this   economic moat into a value-generating machine. While no one will   ever be blown away with the company's growth rates, it continues   to generate gobs of free cash flow that is used to buy back stock   and increase dividend payments. These sorts of   shareholder-friendly initiatives have made Waste Management an   incredible stock to hold for decades at a time.WM Dividenddata byYCharts.It's hard to disrupt a well-entrenched business in the   waste-handling industry, and that makes Waste Management a stock   that should tug at the heartstrings of long-term investors.10 stocks we like better than MastercardWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

U.S. Senate Votes to Eliminate FCC's Broadband Privacy Rules;3/27/2017;"Recently, the U.S. Senate voted against a set of privacy rules for broadband service providers, previously proposed by the telecom regulator FCC (Federal Communications Commission) under the democratic administration of President Obama. On Oct 2016, the then FCC chairman Tom Wheeler had proposed these rules. However, the new FCC -- reconstructed by President Trump with Ajit Pai at its helm -- voted to stay the rules of the previous regime on Mar 1, 2017.The U.S. Senate voted 50-48 to repeal the rules. The vote also prohibits the FCC from reintroducing the rules in the future. The matter will now move to the U.S. House of Representatives.What Are Broadband Privacy Rules?The broadband privacy rules proposed by former FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler required ISPs to get consumers' explicit consent before selling or sharing Web browsing data and other private information with advertisers and other companies. Since ISPs (Internet Service Providers) have direct access to user database, they used to sell the data to digital marketing firms for targeted advertising. This was a major source of revenues for the ISPs.It is important to note that ISPs like Verizon Communications Inc.VZ, AT&T Inc.Tand Comcast Corp.CMCSAare governed by FCC rules. On the other hand, Internet firms such as Facebook Inc.FB, Twitter Inc.TWTRand Alphabet Inc.GOOGLcome under the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) regulations. At present, there are no rules governing data disclosure by Internet firms.  As a result, the 'Opt In' ruling will be an advantage. However, the FCC had assured the ISPs that it will try to harmonize the regulations with the FTC.Notably, all the stocks mentioned above currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy)   stocks here.FCC in the Trump EraDonald Trump already has had quite an impact on telecom policy parameters. On Jan 2017, Trump elected Republican commissioner Ajit Pai as the new Chairman of the FCC. Ajit Pai is a staunch opponent of several laws and rules adopted by the FCC under former Chairman Tom Wheeler's regime, including Net Neutrality laws, rules to reform the business data market and set top box reform proposals. Importantly, all three major reform rules were going to hit the telecom operators and ISPs the most.ISPs to Cheer NowThe digital advertisement market is an exponentially growing space, and ISPs have been increasingly investing resources to cash in on the bountiful opportunities in this space. However, the FCC's previous directive stipulated that the ISP should notify its customers before sharing any user data for advertising. This was certainly going to mar ISPs prospects in this business. Therefore, a new FCC body with less regulatory intention will certainly bode well for the ISP industry.Zacks' Top 10 Stocks for 2017makeArticleAd();In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2017?Who wouldn't?

With all the hype, investors   may be asking themselves: What's the best way to invest in this   growing trend?Let's look at three companies with solid   artificial-intelligence programs: e-commerce titanAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ: AMZN) , Google search parentAlphabet Inc.(NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) , and cognitive-computing leaderInternational Business Machines Corporation(NYSE: IBM) .Amazon's Echo smart-home speaker, powered by AI-based Alexa.     Image source: Amazon, Inc.makeArticleAd();Amazon.comAmazon CEO Jeff Bezos believes that AI could be thefourth pillarof the company's business, behind its e-commerce, its cloud   hosting unit Amazon Web Services (AWS), and its Prime membership   program. Alexa, the company's virtual assistant and AI poster   child, hosts a variety of products that leverage her AI   foundation, including theEcho smart-home speaker, the smaller Dot, and the portable Tap, as well as the Fire   tablet and Fire TV Stick. Using natural-language processing and   cloud computing, these products respond to voice commands, and AI   allows Alexa to learn continuously the more the products are   used. Developers have created more than 10,000 ""skills"" that   provide a variety of functionality, from ordering pizza to   scheduling a ride-share.Amazon has also been leveraging its deep-learning innovations   by deploying them across AWS as managed services available to its   customers. Lex, similar to Alexa, can build sophisticated   chatbots; Rekognition provides image-recognition capabilities;   and Polly reads and recites text. Amazon grew its revenue to $46   billion in its most recent quarter, so its AI contribution is   currently microscopic, but that could change. RBC Capital Markets   predicts that Alexa could contribute an additional $10 billion   annually by 2020.Google Home smart speaker system. Image source: Google.GoogleGoogle has been investing heavily for years in a   sub-discipline of AI calleddeep learning, and the result of that research is an artificial neural   network, christened the Google Brain. By combining massive   amounts of data with complicated algorithms, the system   recognizes patterns and learns in a way similar to the human   brain. The company has infused the knowledge gained into a vast   array of its businesses, using AI to improve the reliability of   its ubiquitous search, decrease the energy consumption of its   servers, and catalog images from its Street View mapping   cars.Its AI-powered Google Assistant, the company's entry in the   growing list ofvirtual personal assistants, is available in many of the company's branded devices and is   the foundation for its Google Home smart speaker system. Google   Assistant interacts with the company's Photos, Maps, Keep,   Calendar, and other services, provides the ability to stream   music and movies to Android mobile devices, and controls   home-automation products. Google is also a well-known pioneer in   the area of AI-based autonomous driving.With $26 billion in revenue for the most recent quarter,   Alphabet will notice little effect from Home just yet; this is a   new product, so we don't have data for how popular it is, but the   potential market is huge. Activate.com estimates that smart   speakers will be in 21 million homes by 2020.Watson employs advanced analytics to ""see"" medical images.     Image source: IBM.IBMIBM's Watsonmight be best remembered for its winning stint on the popular TV   game showJeopardy!, but Watson hasn't been resting on its laurels. You won't see   consumer-facing products coming from Big Blue, but the company   has developed a wide variety of business partnerships using the   abilities of its cognitive AI supercomputer. Watson's earliest   foray was into the field of healthcare, where it has been tasked   with cancer research, immunotherapy, diabetes management, and   genomic sequencing. Most notably, Watson was recently able to   correctly diagnose cancer patients, agreeing with oncologists in   99% of cases. The cognitive computer also successfully diagnosed   a rare form of leukemia in a case that had baffled doctors -- all   within 10 minutes after being fed the data.Watson has partnered in other fields, improving the accuracy   oftax returns, providingcybersecurity, and improving regulatory compliance for financial institutions.   Watson is a bet on AI-based cognitive computing, data analytics,   and cloud computing, as the company moves away from its legacy   hardware and IT services business. IBM has yet to disclose   Watson's contribution, but ""strategic imperatives,"" where   Watson's revenue is reported, grew 13% in 2016 to account for 41%   of total revenue.Foolish final thoughtsThese companies are at the forefront of the AI revolution, but   AI innovations represent only a portion of their total business.   Investors should avoid investing in any of these companies based   solely on the advantages represented by AI.That said, if you like any of these companies and are   interested in adding AI to your portfolio, each offers that   opportunity. While it may be difficult to quantify many of the   benefits, we do know that AI can help increase revenue and   efficiency, provide a compelling and productive ecosystem to   consumers, and provide new opportunities for business.10 stocks we like better than IBMWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Better Than Cash: 8% Payouts “Hedged” Against a Market Pullback (QYLD, EOS);3/27/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIf you're worried about a pullback, I don't blame you. But don't sit in cash and earn nothing when you can hedge your portfolio AND collect yields up to 8%.makeArticleAd();Let's talk about a couple of funds that use a well-worn options tactic - writing ""covered calls"" - that can generate generous yields typically between 7% and 9%. Conveniently, you never have to deal with the complications of options contracts - these funds do all the work for you!But,why covered calls, and why now?Covered calls are an options strategy in which you sell call option contracts against stocks you hold. Selling the call options generates income, called a ""premium."" From there, a couple things can happen. If your stock reaches the strike price of the call option, you're obligated to sell your shares to the call buyer (but you still keep the premium). If your stock stays below the strike price, you still keep the premium, and you can keep your shares - and from there, if you'd like, you can keep selling covered calls against them for more income.Ziegler Capital Management, a specialty investment bank out of Chicago, extols the virtues of covered calls (emphasis mine):""Investors often consider the income from the sale of the call option as a form of downside protection. As a result of this income, covered call strategies have historically generated impressive results compared to the S&P 500 Index in terms of risk mitigation and volatility reduction. … Over a market cycle,covered call strategies have tended to produce equity-like returns with lower beta and lower volatility.""10 Mutual Funds You Can Buy and Hold ForeverThis strategy does limit your upside during raging bull markets, but whether we're about to fly into some market turbulence, or on the slim chance that a significant downturn is nigh, covered calls are the place to be.And if you don't want to deal with the complexity of trading options, don't worry. There are a number of exchange-traded funds and closed-end funds that do all the heavy lifting and deliver substantial income with lower volatility.Of course … some funds are better than others…Recon Capital Nasdaq 100 Covered Call ETF (QYLD)Dividend Yield:8%TheRecon Capital Nasdaq 100 Covered Call ETF QYLD(NASDAQ:QYLD) is an exchange-traded fund that executes the covered call strategy in a simple, straightforward way against theNasdaq-100.That's a good place to start, as the Nasdaq-100 - which is composed of the 100 largest non-financial companies on the Nasdaq, including stocks likeApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL),Alphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL) andMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) - offers solid large-cap exposure as a base.For just 0.6 percent in annual fees, QYLD tracks an index that's based on buying a Nasdaq-100 portfolio, then selling short-term covered calls (about one month to expiration) on the third Friday of each month.If it sounds simple, it's because it is - but that ultimately does a disservice to QYLD. This is a passive index that executes the same strategy, month after month, on a single index, without any regard to whether the fund is actually getting any value out of the premiums it's collecting. In some cases, the premium isn't nearly enough to cover the risk of selling the options.As a result, QYLD -as I mentioned a few weeks ago- has been a dud. Despite a nearly 8% yield (paid monthly), QYLD hasn't just trailed the annualized 15.3% return of the Nasdaq-100 since 2014 - which we would expect because of covered calls' limited upside in bull markets - but at just 5.6% annualized, price losses have eaten away at investors' income!Recon Capital's QYLD Has Been a Yield Trap for YearsEaton Vance Enhanced Income Fund II (EOS)Dividend Yield:7.8%Sometimes, cheap, passive investing works. If you haven't already, I urge you tocheck out just how important low fees from index funds can be to long-term returns. But when it comes to covered calls, it pays to pay for quality managers.The Eaton Vance Enhanced Income Fund (EOS) and its three-pronged management team of Michael Allison, Lewis Piantedosi and Yana Barton generate income not just from a single index, but from about 60 individual stocks, such asAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN),Visa Inc(NYSE:V) andCelgene Corporation(NASAQ:CELG).This allows EOS to pick its spots and grab premium when it makes the most sense - and avoid selling covered calls when doing so would be detrimental to returns. Case in point? At the end of 2016, EOS boasted sold contracts on less than half the portfolio!The 7 Best ETFs for Market-Beating ReturnsAnd while Eaton Vance's fund racks up a bit more in fees and expenses than QYLD, at 1.11%, it more than makes it up in performance. EOS boasts an annualized total return of 13% over the past five years - some capital gains to go with that meaty yield!Eaton Vance's EOS Packs a Total Return PunchThe Retirement Portfolio You NEVER Have to Touch!If you want a retirement that you can actually enjoy, you'll need a lot more than 8% yields that ultimately get you nowhere. You need the kinds of holdings that can throw off high-single-digit and even double-digit yields … but also give you a few percentage points in capital gains year-in and year-out.And that's exactly the kind of holdings you'll find in my""No Withdrawal"" retirement portfolio.Too many investors are suckered into buying big-name large-cap blue chips that boast safety on the promise of ""big"" yields … of 3%, maybe 4% if you're lucky. But these stocks more often than not can start to rot in your portfolio with dividend increases that don't even keep up with inflation, and tiny capital gains because they've given up on growth a long, long time ago. And if you're getting just 3% or 4% in returns out of these stocks, do you know what that translates to?Annual retirement income of just $30,000, maybe $40,000 a year. Think you'll get far on that?You and I both know better.That's why I recommend a""No Withdrawal"" retirement portfolio- a set of buy-and-hold dividend stocks that generate yields of 7%, 8%, or more … along with 7% to 15% upside in annual capital gains. That meansyou can live off dividend income alone without ever touching your nest egg- but if disaster strikes and you need to dip in, that's OK, because you've grown your retirement account with these double-whammy dynamos.What makes this portfolio so effective is that it's an all-star makeup - rather than focusing on just one area of the market, it's the best of the best preferred stocks, REITs, closed-end funds and more. That means diversification and continued payouts against the most volatile of markets.Don't spend your retirement hoping you can just get by on meager blue-chip returns and your Social Security checks. Collect big, regular dividend checks instead that will let you pay the bills, finance your vacations and even spoil your family.This is the path to the worry-free retirement you deserve.Click here and I'll provide you with THREE special reports that show you the path to building a ""No Withdrawal"" portfolio.

United States Steel Corporation (X) Stock Hammered by … Healthcare?;3/27/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsUnited States Steel Corporation(NYSE:X) and other steel-related stocks took a significant hit on Monday thanks to the unlikeliest of culprits: failed healthcare reform.makeArticleAd();Source:Irene Grassi via Wikimedia (Modified)X stock was off more than 4%, as wasAK Steel Holding Corporation(NYSE:AKS), andSteel Dynamics, Inc.(NASDAQ:STLD) was down more than 2% amid a reverse ""Trump bump"" trade on the heels of the American Health Care Act's failure late last week.The reasoning has nothing to do with the bill itself, of course, but instead the questions of ""what's next?"" That's because the failure of one of Donald Trump's many campaign promises has brought into doubt the timing of some of his next action items - and even whether he'll be able to push those through.The promise of a monster infrastructure spend has steel equities like X stock, as well as other infrastructure plays, down solidly on Monday morning. But the insecurity is also hitting other sectors, such as financials, which were promised a much lighter regulatory environment under the GOP.Bank of America Corp(NYSE:BAC) is helping lead the way down with 2%-plus losses.8 Places to Run and Hide in a Market CrashU.S. Steel has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of Trump-spurred buying, up roughly 65% since the November elections through the end of last week.On the flip side, U.S. Steel has also picked up quite a bit of short interest, with a bit more than 11% of the float sold short as of the most recent data.X stock has been letting off steam since late February, and had already crossed below its 20- and 50-day moving averages in recent weeks - and in fact, the shorter-term MA is close to crossing below the 50-day - a short-term technical bearish signal that U.S. Steel could do without.Now, X shares are trading around the $31.40 level - a bit of price support that the stock last hit at the start of February. Should X stock break below there, it faces what should be strong technical support at its 200-day moving average, which currently sits at $26.60.Still, that would be another 15% drop from here.As of this writing, Robert Martin did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc.

Why Apple (AAPL) Acquired Workflow And What It Means For Apple Stock;3/27/2017;"If you consider yourself a “power user” of Apple’s (AAPL) line of MacOS and iOS devices, the Cupertino-based tech giant’s acquisition of Workflow is poised to make your life a lot easier.And for investors who have worried about so-called “peak-Apple” given that shares are up some 21% in three months, Apple stock is positioned to keep climbing on the assumption that the company is becoming less reliant on the success of the iPhone — which, by the way, continues to put up solid numbers after a slight dip a year ago.First reported by TechCrunch, Apple on Thursday acquired Workflow, an app that automates frequently performed actions on its devices. Only three years old, Workflow founders and investors received what TechCrunch called ""a solid payday.” We don’t know what that means given that terms of the deal were not disclosed. However, what we do know is that Workflow, whose motto is ""spend less taps, get more done,” is one of the most-popular apps on Apple’s App Store.makeArticleAd();For only $2.99, Workflow connects apps and functions that allows users to automate the things they do most often on their Apple devices. For example, by generating shortcuts and placing the corresponding icons on their home screen, users can request an Uber just from a single tap, using a preset location. Likewise, with one tap, Workflow users can receive the top news stories from the day or order a Starbucks (SBUX) latte without opening the Starbucks app.There are several reasons why Apple bought Workflow, which awarded Workflow with an Apple Design award at its annual Apple Worldwide Developers Conference in 2015. Workflow, which is also available on Apple Watch, has been praised by Apple for features such as VoiceOver and and drag/drop. But given the rapid rise and dominance of Amazon’s (AMZN) home speaker, combined with Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Google Home, Apple can now integrate Workflow with its voice-activated assistant Siri.Likewise, Apple CEO Tim Cook has shown tons of interest in the realm of artificial intelligence (AI). Workflow’s ability to make different apps talk to each other could be the missing piece Apple has been seeking to fully immerse itself into HomeKit. And the fact that Apple has already made Workflow free on Apple devices, removing the previous $2.99 price, suggests Apple is serious about ramping up the number of people who uses the app.All told, this move also underscores the extent to which Apple is aggressively looking to grow its Services segment, which accounted for 9.2% of total revenue in the first quarter. Based on Friday’s closing price of $140.64, AAPL stock is priced at 16 times fiscal 2017 estimates of $8.94 per share, compared to 18 P/E for the S&P 500 index. Workflow’s acquisitions and others that may follow keeps Apple stock on track to reach $160 by the end of the year."

Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock Is a High-Risk All-Star;3/27/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe entire semiconductor sector is on a roll. The PHLX Semiconductor Sector(NASDAQ:SOX) started March at 985 and has already flown above the 1,000 level thanks to product launches fromAdvanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ:AMD) and a solid quarterly earnings report fromMicron Technology, Inc.(NASDAQ:MU).makeArticleAd();Source: AMDOnlyIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) stands out as the underperformer in this market. The takeover ofMobileye NV(NYSE:MBLY) for $15 billion will add risks for shareholders, as integrating such a big company will be fraught with uncertainties.Investors should stick with what they know best: Advanced Micro Devices' CPU refresh, with the Ryzen 7 and the Ryzen 5 next, holds big promise for AMD stock. And as much as that promise seems priced in … it's not.Ryzen 5 Targets the Mainstream MarketThe Ryzen 7 CPU, rebuilt from the bottom up, will compete with some of Intel's high-end chips, including the i7 processor. AMD is targeting enthusiasts here, so the chip is still at the high end. Still, at least one outlet cut theprice of Ryzento 1700X to $370. As the price falls, AMD should be able to gobble up more share.Ryzen 5 targets a different market than the 7, however.9 Stocks to Buy That Are Growing Faster Than AmazonRetailers are apparently releasing the chip weeksahead of schedule, and at a price range that won't cramp the ol' wallet. On April 11, AMD will officially announce four Ryzen 5 chips: the 1400, 1500x, 1600 and 1600X.The chips will range from 4-cores to 6-cores and will cost just $169 to $249. At that price point, Intel's budget i3 chip and Pentium chips will look laughably expensive. Ryzen 5 offers between 8 and 12 threads, which is up to three times more than that offered on the G-series Pentium processors.The high-end Ryzen 5 chips will compete with Intel's i5 7600K, since the former costs just $10 more.AMD Stock: Growth, But With RisksRyzen 7 must win PC enthusiastsnow. The more gamers that use AMD chips, the faster that game developers will optimize the software to work efficiently on Ryzen.Meanwhile, Ryzen 5 must win the OEM and PC manufacturing orders. Big companies likeDell,HP Inc(NYSE:HPQ) andLenovocould give shelf space to AMD-based computers and laptops. If that happens, AMD will be chewing market share from Intel on a couple of fronts.Also, Polaris-based graphics cards can help AMD win back some market share fromNVIDIA Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA).The combination of low price and high performance mean those two events are likely.However, those who believe in AMD stock are already sitting on a massive four-fold return in the past year. Now, shares traded at more than 47 times forward earnings projections.Meanwhile, as investors are finding out Monday, any market downswings will likely be used as opportunities to take profits in Advanced Micro Devices. And there are a lot of investors sitting on significant profits.Current and Future Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Stock Owners, Keep an Eye on ThisIf the CPU refresh is as successful as its GPU refresh, though, the stock has room to run, and CEO Lisa Su will look like a star.A Note on IntelAMD clearly is shaking up the CPU market with high-performance chips at a good price. But Intel as an investment may make more sense for certain investors.Income investors get a nearly 3% dividend holding INTC, bolstered by an increase to the dividend on March 23, to 27.25 cents per share - a 4.8% hike. Moreover, its value metrics are much more attractive than AMD's.Of course, no one expects Intel to triple its earnings, either.As of this writing, Chris Lau was long AMD.More From InvestorPlaceThe Core of Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Is at Risk3 Stocks to Watch on Monday: Apple Inc.

Current and Future Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Stock Owners, Keep an Eye on This;3/27/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsLast week, chipmaker - and graphics processing specialist -Nvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA) unveiled some encouraging but perhaps unusual news. That is, Chinese internet powerhouseTencent Holdings Ltd(OTCMKTS:TCTZF) hasselected Nvidia as the providerof its core hardware needed to make Tencent's artificial intelligence ambitions a reality.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockIt was odd, simply because that's not what Nvidia does. A more conventional computer processor and chipset name likeAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMD) orIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) would make more sense serving as the backbone for a new AI system.Thing is, this isn't the first time owners of NVDA stock have heard of the company's hardware being selected as the centerpiece of an artificial intelligence system. Just two weeks ago, Nvidia was tapped byMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) topower the next generationof its AI offering.What gives?As it turns out, traditional computer processors like Intel's Core and Pentium CPUs or AMD'sRyzenaren't necessarily best-suited for the ultra-high-speed processing needs the rise of AI has created. Investors - and not just NVDA stock holders - would be wise to note the nuance, as AI is expected to become a$16 billion marketby 2022, andgrow to $36 billionby 2025.GPU Technology vs. CPU TechnologyHistorically, while the hardware and firmware supporting a computer's (or laptop's) display screen was a key part of its performance, a device's heart and soul was its processor, or CPU. It operates… well, everything at blazing fast speed, with more RAM (memory) helping out.7 Consumer Stocks That Will Lead Your PortfolioThe graphics processing unit, or GPU, wasn't a dealmaker or a dealbreaker.As computers have become faster and more powerful, though, and performance expectations have swelled, GPUs have become very, very impressive, in many cases fully taking on the display-management role that was otherwise taken on by the CPU. Indeed, a GPU is some4thing of a mini-computer in itself…… and they're very, very fast. That makes them perfect for high-speed artificial intelligence applications, where the quantity of computations is more important than the depth or complexity of those computations.An entry posted at the Nvidia corporate blog in the middle of last year not only served as something of an omen to the tech world, but to savvy owners of Nvidia stock as well.It explains:""Computer programs contain commands that are largely executed sequentially. Deep learning is a fundamentally new software model where billions of software-neurons and trillions of connections are trained, in parallel.

Ignore the Chesapeake Energy Corporation (CHK) “Death Cross” … For Now;3/27/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsDespite much talk about OPEC production cuts and stabilizing energy supplies around the globe, the energy sector rally that many on Wall Street anticipated has yet to materialize. This has been awful news for companies likeChesapeake Energy Corporation(NYSE:CHK). In fact, CHK stock has fallen more than 32% since early December, forcing the shares to test key support at $5.makeArticleAd();Click to EnlargeBut all is not lost for Chesapeake Energy bulls, and an opportunity may be in the cards.The Death Cross (And the Rest of the Chart)Now, you're likely to hear quite a bit in the next few days about the ""death cross"" of CHK's 50- and 200-day moving averages. This technical formation is often considered a harbinger of weak intermediate-term price action.But while it might yet have some impact on CHK stock, there is plenty of room for the stock to run before the situation turns sour.For instance, Chesapeake Energy recently set a double bottom in the $5 region, as support in the area grows increasingly firm. What's more, the shares' 10- and 20-day moving averages are in the midst of a bullish cross - another technical formation that indicates short-term buying strength.Weighing the technical factors together, CHK should be able to run at least as high as $6 before encountering its 50-day moving average. And if the shares have built up enough momentum by the time this confrontations occurs, it could give Chesapeake Energy the buying power it needs to overcome this hurdle.Sentiment and OptionsTurning toward the sentiment front, we find considerable room for improvement. For instance, Thomson/First Call reports that only six of the 35 analysts following Chesapeake stock rate it a ""buy"" or better. Meanwhile, the 12-month price target rests at $7.30, implying almost 41% upside for the shares over the long-term.The 7 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for the Second QuarterIn other words, if CHK stock can make some headway toward this target, we could see an upgrade or two provide additional lift for the shares.Short interest could also play a role in a Chesapeake Energy rebound. As of the most recent reporting period, the number of shares sold short stood at 134.6 million, or 15.4% of the stock's total float. That said, CHK may need to top $6 before any of these short-sellers rush to buy back their bets.Judging from the options backdrop, many of these short sellers might be worried about a short-squeeze situation over the short-term.Currently, CHK's April put/call open interest ratio stands at 0.23, with calls more than quadrupling puts among options set to expire within the next month. Overall, April implieds are pricing in a potential move of about 7% for CHK stock over the next month.This places the upper bound at $5.62, while the lower bound lies at $4.88.2 Trades for CHK StockCall Spread:Traders looking to take advantage of a short-term rebound for Chesapeake might want to consider an April $5.50/$6 bull call spread.The Core of Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Is at RiskAt last check, this spread was offered at 12 cents, or $12 per pair of contracts. Breakeven lies at $5.62, while a maximum profit of 38 cents, or $38 per pair of contracts, is possible if CHK closes at or above $6 when April options expire.Put Sell:Alternately, if you're looking for a more conservative play on CHK stock, an April $5 put sell has a good chance at finishing out of the money.At last check, this option was bid at 17 cents, or $17 per contract. As usual with a put sell, you keep the premium as long as Chesapeake closes above $5 when April options expire. On the downside, if shares trade below $5 prior to expiration, you could be assigned 100 shares for each put sold at a cost of $5 per share.As of this writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace3 Stocks to Watch on Monday: Apple Inc.

The Core of Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Is at Risk;3/27/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAs the weather has begun to warm, some of our best writers here atInvestorPlacehave turned a little cautious onAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL), the artist formerly known as Google.makeArticleAd();GOOGL stock ""carries some risks,"" wroteLawrence Meyers.Chris TylerandNicholas Chahinerecently suggested option trades on the stock, rather than an outright buy, and Tyler even offered a bearish strategy. Even I recently put an""if""in the ""Google $1,000"" prediction.All these stories were written before the latest news to hit the company.That news is theGoogle ""ad strike,""which is highlighting the Achilles heel of the company's entire business model. It threatens GOOGL stock, and it will take more than cosmetic surgery to fix.Algorithms Killed the Publishing StarThe problem lies in Google's ""programmatic advertising"" model, which uses intrinsic targeting to decide which adsto place in front of readers.With an intrinsic model, ads are placed based on the demographics and browsing history of users, rather than content they are looking at. Any website can get the ads, even if your page has a jihadi video on it, or anti-gay hate speech, or something else an advertiser might find objectionable.The 7 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for the Second QuarterContent that YouTube will take for upload might not be the kind of contentEnterprise Rent-a-Car, which recently joined the strike, wants its ad to appear next to.Between them, Google andFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB), which also uses programmatic computer-driven advertising, should take 46% of all digital ad spending this year, over $100 billion. The global market for online ads is approaching $600 billion, nearly 40% of all advertising.Google has been aware of the danger for some time, and its efforts to correct itby taking ads off certain sitescan be as ham-handed as its advertising policy. That's because banning decisions are still being made by computers, not by people.People are good at gaming systems, and artificial intelligence isn't foolproof.The Real Problem Is BiggerGOOGL is not going to get any support from publishers here, because it's publishers who have been getting killed by programmatic advertising.The whole point of publishing is to create a premium audience, aggregating people based on their location, their industry or lifestyle, and seek a premium price for reaching those people. Programmatic advertising destroys this model, allowing advertisers to pick off readers one by one, buying access to them all at a run of network price.Thus clickbait, whether ""fake news"" or not, is crowding out real news. No one is maintaining standards. The standard for what can be published is different from the standard of what an advertiser wants his soap suds sold next to.Phone Companies Make Things WorseThis is not a question that ""more data"" is going to fix.The recent move to kill Internet privacy, allowingVerizon Communications Inc.(NYSE:VZ) andAT&T Inc.(NYSE:T) -both of which have joined the ad strike- to sell their data on consumers just throws more data on the pile, without doing anything to solve the problem.Here's Where Micron Technology, Inc. (MU) Stock Will Be a Better BuyThe problem is that advertisers want to control where their message goes. Each advertiser has its own standards and practices in this area. From a technical perspective, it would require the creation of thousands of blacklists for advertisers and keeping ads off sites that violate standards, even if the content is legal. This creates more trouble, as sites with legal contentdispute computer decisionsover their acceptability.There is another solution. Create a premium tier of highly-qualified sites and pay them premium prices for their audiences. That's what the big publishers want. It's a strategy that would keep small publishers from the Web advertising pie, because they would not be able to pay for the vetting, but it sure would make theNew York Times Co(NYSE:NYT) happy.This is a mess that goes to the heart of what GOOGL is all about, self-service content meeting self-service advertising. Self-service is the goose that laid Google's golden eggs - no other unit of the company can take up the slack.Investors need to take this as seriously as a heart attack.Dana Blankenhornis a financial and technology journalist.

Facebook Is Partnering With Amazon.com to Take on Google;3/27/2017;"Facebook(NASDAQ: FB) is already a dominant force in digital display   advertising. eMarkter expects the social network giant's share of   the U.S. market to climb to 39.1% this year, as it sells more   than three times as much display advertising as its next closest   competitor, Google. TheAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) company is expected to generate   $5.2 billion in U.S. display advertising this year.But Facebook's ad revenue is largely confined to its own   properties, such as Facebook and Instagram. The Facebook Audience   Network (FAN) -- its ad network -- generates only a few hundred   million in annual net ad revenue for the company. That number   could get a significant boost in the near term, as Facebook just   announced it's rolling out header bidding to all mobile web   publishers. That represents not only a significant opportunity   for Facebook to increase its network ad revenue, but a threat to   Google's display ad business as well.Image source: FacebookmakeArticleAd();Publishers love header biddingHeader bidding is a system that levels the playing field when   it comes to selling ads online. Previously, whenever you loaded a   web page, that publisher would check ad networks one by one until   it found an advertiser willing to pay a reasonable price to   populate the ads on the site. Since Google is such a dominant   force in advertising, publishers' searches usually started and   ended with Google.Header bidding allows publishers to collect bids from multiple   ad networks at the same time and receive the highest bid for its   ad inventory. As a result, publishers receive more revenue for   their ads, and smaller ad networks stand a fighting chance   against Google. The more ad networks supporting header bidding,   the better it is for publishers. Facebook says publishers in its   tests saw a revenue increase of 10% to 30%.Image source: FacebookAmazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) notably developed a header bidding solution last   year in an effort to potentially growits advertising business. Given Amazon's prowess in cloud computing -- supporting   hundreds of major websites -- its integrated cloud-based solution   could prove extremely popular with publishers. Now, Facebook is   partnering with Amazon and several other header-bidding system   developers to bring its ad network to more publishers.Growing the ad networkFacebook's audience network still represents a small part of   Facebook's revenue. It reached a $1 billion run rate at the   beginning of 2016, but that's gross revenue. Facebook only keeps   a small percentage of that figure as net revenue.During Facebook's second-quarter earnings call last year, CFO   Dave Wehner told analysts: ""The overall growth is still being   driven predominantly by Facebook. Instagram is clearly making a   contribution, as is the Audience Network.""That may change later this year, however, as Facebook faces ad   load saturation. But with the social network's steady user growth   and continued increases in engagement, Facebook's enormousness   will still be tough to overshadow.Nonetheless, the growth of FAN will certainly help Facebook   offset some of the slowdown at its flagship app. In fact, since   the audience network uses the same targeting data as Facebook's   in-house ads, Facebook advertisers may be inclined to start   buying more ads on Facebook, especially if header bidding   increases its ability to win bids on publishers' websites.FAN represents an opportunity for marketers to reach   Facebook's audience outside Facebook and even expand beyond   Facebook. Management says FAN offers 16% greater reach than   Facebook alone and now reaches 1 billion people monthly.The impact on GoogleThe value of FAN to publishers is that Facebook requires   marketers to bid the same on FAN ads as on its own ads.   Therefore, third-party publishers get the same (presumably high)   rates as Facebook. If Facebook's average bid is higher than   Google's, it could force Google to lower its take rate from   publishers.Last year, Google generated $15.6 billion in gross revenue   from its network partners. It also paid out $10.9 billion in   revenue sharing to those publishers, about 70%. In fact,   publishers' revenue share from Google has increased two   percentage points since 2014, when header bidding started   becoming popular.Google said that ""the increase in Network Members' TAC   [traffic acquisition cost] rate was primarily driven by the shift   in advertising buying from our traditional network business to   programmatic advertising buying."" As more ad sales shift to   header bidding and more ad networks like Facebook join the fray,   Google stands to see that number continue climbing, unless it   wants to lose out on some of that $15.6 billion in gross revenue   it generated last year.10 stocks we like better than FacebookWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Buy Some Downside to Own Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock at a Discount;3/24/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsInvestors have been hammered inAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) in more ways than one this week. But is it time to buy GOOGL stock's pullback? Let's take a look at what's behind the price action, the technical picture and a limited-risk options strategy on Alphabet to better navigate the environment.makeArticleAd();Source:Travis Wise via FlickrThe consensus view earlier this year had been anypolitical risksfacing Alphabet would surely be coming out of China or from Capitol Hill. But it was a problem from across the pond and from our European neighbors in the U.K. that sent shares of GOOGL tumbling this week.For the weekly period, shares of Alphabet are off about 4% after influential foreign ad buyers lashed out about how their ads had been placed alongside terrorist and other extremism media on Google's YouTube. For its part, Alphabet is taking action and looking to improve its""brand safety controls.""Improvements aren't happening soon enough for some though. Earlier this week, asBarron's noted,France'sHavas SA, the world's sixth largest marketing agency, stated it had pulled the plug on all client advertising in the U.K. from both YouTube and the Google Display Network.And now American companies are joining the ranks in protest as well.10 Clobbered Stocks to Buy That Are About to Get Red-HotIn the interim and while the controversy plays out withbullslike Pacific Crest and bears, or at leastalarmists, chiming in, we can take a visual look at how things are playing out in GOOGL stock.GOOGL Stock Daily ChartJust prior to this week's sudden and volatile bout of profit-taking, GOOGL stock had been making all the right technical moves. Since the beginning of 2017, shares of Alphabet managed to successfully clear the prior all-time highs, rally, establish a successful test of support and then proceed to even higher highs.Now - despite the quick drop of around 4% this week - our view is Alphabet could be setting up as a pullback entry. For the more quick-fingered among us, the hammering of shares by Thursday's close actually formed a bullish hammer low.The reversal pattern has some backing from an oversold stochastics condition and received price confirmation early Friday as GOOGL stock moved above the candlestick's high of $841.69.Is it perfect? No. There has been some distribution, the current setup is modestly below the well-watched 50-day simple moving average and trends do eventually end.Personally and given the mixed evidence, I'd rather look at entering into GOOGL stock if it were to trade down into a support zone from around $795 - $825. The potential area of support holds a couple retracement levels, the 200-day simple moving average and a second test of the prior highs, and amounts to a correction of up to 9% within the bigger picture's established uptrend.GOOGL Long Put ButterflyGiven my belief that the hammering may not be completely done in Alphabet, I like the idea of an atypical approach to positioning for downside and buying stock at lower levels.With GOOGL near $840, the April $835/$820/$805 is priced for $2.20 or better. The bearishly targeted butterfly achieves its maximum profit of $12.80 if shares fall 2.5% to $820 on expiration. More achievable, the limited risk spread maintains a profit range from $807.20 to $832.80 and prior to that third Friday, gains can even be realized outside the targeted price zone.Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock Has a Powerful New WeaponIf GOOGL stock actually begins to rally in a material way, I would personally look to cut risk using a money stop of 50%, or $1.10. While the initial debit is small, holding on and remaining on the wrong side of price action in a name the trader ultimately wants to own at lower prices doesn't make sense.Were shares of Alphabet to fall below $805, the trader will be out the full debit. However, if the end game is buying GOOGL on weakness as it enters the support zone, knowing the most you'd pay for the stock is $807.20 and possibly a lot less, is worth considering.Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in any of the securities or their derivatives mentioned in this article.

How Much Will Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Fall If the iPhone 8 Flops?;3/24/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsCalling a spade a spade,Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) is the most recognizable names in the world. By extension, AAPL stock remains one of the market's most sought-after picks.makeArticleAd();Source:iphonedigital via FlickrBoth platitudes are well deserved. The company has earned its way to the top, making a piece of hardware - the iPhone - not only a technical marvel, but a status symbol and lifestyle centerpiece like no other. The device keeps millions of consumers ranging from tweens to geriatrics with their noses buried in their smartphones in all four corners of the earth.Nevertheless …While Apple has been largely deserving of its spot on so many investors' pedestals, that sort of collective homage is always dangerous. Nothing lasts forever, and as unpopular as the premise may be, it would be wise to at least entertain the possibility that the next-generation iPhone (referred to the iPhone 8 so far) could the unveiling that starts exposing Apple's cracks.iPhone 8 Flop? Never!Before you pull out your pitchfork, start heating up the tar and gather your feathers, dial it back just a bit. This isn't to say that even a mediocre Apple still isn't better than most any other stock on the planet.10 Safe Dividend Stocks to Own During the Next Market CrashStill, there are three key reasons the iPhone 8 could end up not beingthe panaceait has been made out to be. Yes, they're rather obvious, but concerns all the same:1. People Really Are Growing Tired of the Constant ConnectivityIt was fun for a few years, but some smartphone owners - an increasing number of them - are starting to realize their unhealthy addiction to their devices. A survey performed last year indicated that42% of Americansconstantly check their phones for new messages. It's a statistic being noticed by impartial observes like CTV technology analyst Carmi Levy.Levy commentedlast year:""The promise of technology is that it'll improve our lives, but sometimes we become enslaved to the technology because there's so much going on. A certain part of our brain is always looking for something that is perhaps simpler … and delivers as promised with fewer frustrations.""Enough consumers are starting to move the notion out of their subconscious into their conscious.2. $1,000 for a Phone? Really?Yep, somebody out there won't think twice about paying it. A lot of people won't think twice about paying it. For a wide swath of iPhone fans who will sooner or later realize that's more than one month's rent or mortgage payment, though, they're due a ""get real"" moment.3. Strong CompetitionFor the longest time, Apple had little to no competition. That's changing though. Yes,the exploding battery debacleSamsung Electronics(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) faced with its Galaxy 7 phones was damning, and it's not like the Google Pixel fromAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL)was a smashing successthat threatened Apple either.Both companies are still overhauling their hardware and improving their designs though, and consumers are taking notice, for about a third to half the cost of an iPhone.Potential Impact on AAPL StockAs for the impact a lackluster iPhone 8 response might have on AAPL stock, one can only guess. But, one can still make an educated guess.For its most recently completed quarter, Applesold 78.29 million iPhones, generating $54.38 billion worth of revenue. That's not necessarily a full picture of the then-new iPhone 7's success, however. The device was actually unveiled a few days prior to the beginning of the quarter, and saw tremendous sales immediately after its launch. For the iPhone 7's inaugural quarter, the company producediPhone revenue of $28.16 billion, selling 45.51 million units. Between both quarters, the bulk of the iPhones sold were the 7 model.It was record-breaking success, by the way, with the78.29 million iPhones sold last quarteredging out sales of the second edition of the iPhone 6 in the comparable quarter a year earlier. The average selling price for the most recent quarter comes out to $695 apiece.That price tag does present something of a quandary for any estimates regarding the impending success of the iPhone 8. It could sell 30% fewer phones, but inasmuch as the cost of the 8 is more than 40% greater than the 7, Apple could conceivably do just as well (and possibly post wider margins).This is where putting AAPL stock on a pedestal becomes a bit of a problem though.Bottom Line for AppleFor better or worse, Apple shareholders have largely been trained to expect beats not just of revenue and earnings estimates, but also beats of sales as measured by units. Any weakness on any front poses a risk to a usually frothy AAPL valuation.My prediction? I firmly believe the iPhone 8 will be an unexpected disappointment, though that's distinctly different than a flop. Some - though not all - will balk at a four-figure sticker price, forcing people to finally ask themselves ""What are we doing, paying a thousand bucks to keep in touch onFacebookand to play mobile video games on a five inch screen?""Again, don't misunderstand. I fully acknowledge there are some utilitarian features on the iPhone 8 that will be viewed as a must-have for some consumers.Wireless chargingis convenient, and the built-in touch ID is going to be critical to some business users concerned about security.By and large though, I have to believe the average consumer just wants a phone they can use to stay connected, via the web and voice. An edge-to-edge screen or a lack of a home button isn't the game-changer it's being made it to be, especially at $1,000 a pop … even for people who only own the iPhone as a status symbol.Kroger Co (KR) Stock Looks Very Attractive Right NowTo quantify my pessimism, I'm guessing Apple sells 70 million units of the iPhone 8 in its first full quarter starting in October. That translates into more year-over-year revenue, but is still a letdown for what's supposed to be ""the best iPhone ever."" Such a result could easily send AAPL sock careening, though odds are good the market would figure it out before the official numbers were released by the company. AAPL stock could lose as much as 20% of its value on that kind of worry.Perhaps worse than the numbers themselves would be the sudden realization that Apple is indeed fallible. A bad quarter is forgivable. A flawed business model isn't as easily forgotten.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace9 Cheap Stocks to Buy Now Under $9 a Share10 Clobbered Stocks to Buy That Are About to Get Red-HotThe postHow Much Will Apple Inc.

Will Twitter's Proposed Subscription Model Achieve Success?;3/24/2017;"Twitter Inc.TWTRis contemplating on developing a premium version of Tweetdeck interface, for which the company will charge subscription fees. Tweetdeck helps users navigate Twitter and the premium version will probably be ad-free.makeArticleAd();But will this move be successful in reinvigorating Twitter's dwindling top-line growth?We believe that this is a tough proposition considering Twitter's meager user growth amid significant competition from FacebookFB. The complex nature of Twitter's service has been often considered as a major hindrance to user growth.With 319 million users, Twitter trails way behind Facebook, which has over 1.8 billion users. Even Facebook's subsidiary, Instagram has over 600 million users. In the trailing 12 months, Twitter's Monthly average users (MAUs) increased only 14 million as compared with Facebook's massive 269 million.This has also affected top-line growth, particularly Twitter's, which is significantly dependent on advertising revenues (roughly 90% of total revenue) as compared with Facebook. We note that the social-media giant's revenues have jumped almost 50% in last 12 months to $8.81 billion as compared with roughly 1% growth to $717 million for Twitter.Twitter, Inc. Revenue (TTM)Twitter, Inc. Revenue (TTM)|Twitter, Inc. QuoteThe sluggish user and top-line growth has impacted stock price. Twitter shares have declined 6.1% as compared with the ZacksInternet Softwareindustry's increase of 10.5%.Twitter Losing Ad revenue ShareNo doubt, Alphabet'sGOOGLGoogle division and Facebook will continue to dominate the digital ad revenue market for the next several years. However, Twitter is now anticipated to lose market share due to intensifying competition from Snapchat.As per research firm, eMarketer, Snapchat-parent Snap Inc.'sSNAPad revenues for the current year are projected to be $770 million, up 157.8% over fiscal 2016. The revenue figure is expected to hit $1.30 billion in 2018 and $2.20 billion in 2019.Meanwhile Twitter's ad-revenues are expected to decline from $1.36 billion in 2016 to $1.30 billion in 2017. The figure is expected to remain flat in 2018 and increase slightly to $1.31 billion in 2019.Twitter's mobile ad revenue market share is anticipated to decline from 2.6% in 2016 to 1.4% in 2019. In comparison, Snap's will increase rapidly from 0.6% to 2.7% in the same period.Can Twitter Rebound?Twitter's shares have recently been hit by several issues like terrorist accounts, bot problems and the top-level management exodus. However, the brand's popularity is hard to ignore as it has emerged from being a mere messaging platform to a powerful sociopolitical tool in the recent years.We believe that the subscription model can find takers among professionals, who prefer to work in an ad-free environment. A tiered pricing structure with additional features, much like LinkedIn, can actually help Twitter to attract new users. Moreover, the company's focus on promoting live video streaming will help the company to remain competitive in the market.Currently, Twitter carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Apple (AAPL) Acquires Workflow, to Integrate with SIRI;3/24/2017;"Apple Inc.AAPLrecently acquired Workflow, a popular automation app, which allows users to group together varied number of actions to complete tasks. Workflow has been developed by Ari Weinstein and his team. The app won an Apple Design Award in 2015.makeArticleAd();Per Techcrunch, Apple is likely to integrate the Workflow app with its Siri Application program interface (API) as well as its private APIs going forward. The integration will help in expanding the iOS ecosystem and improve app accessibility irrespective of the complexity of devices.Workflow is an important addition to App Store, which has become a major source of revenues for the company in recent times. (Read More:Apple's App Store Reports Record Sales for 2016)Apple Inc. Revenue (TTM)Apple Inc. Revenue (TTM)|Apple Inc. QuoteMoreover, the integration of Workflow's automation capabilities with Apple's private APIs is expected to make the process of developing Augmented Reality (AR) devices easier.AR Initiatives Present Growth OpportunityApple was not the first company to develop a smartphone. However, its flagship iPhone is an iconic product that has revolutionized the market. The device helped the company to strengthen its brand name as an ""innovator"" and boosted share price.Notably, since the launch of the first iPhone (Jun 29, 2007), the stock has gained a massive 708.3% compared with the ZacksComputer-Miniindustry's gain of 325.6%.However, Apple is now under tremendous pressure to launch a new product (especially after the lackluster Apple Watch), which can maintain its reputation. AR is one of the many fields under consideration. In fact, there have been quite a few rumors regarding the company's AR efforts as CEO Tim Cook has consistently emphasized on developing the technology in the last few months.Per Bloomberg, Apple has built a team combining people who have experience in working on Facebook'sFBOculus and Microsoft'sMSFTHoloLens. The company has also acquired several smaller firms with expertise in AR hardware, 3D gaming and virtual reality software.The market presents significant growth opportunity for Apple despite competition from AlphabetGOOGL, Microsoft and Facebook. According to Bloomberg, which quoted Global Market Insights figures, the global market for AR products will surge 80% to $165 billion by 2024. Per IDC, global revenues of the AR/VR market are expected to grow at a CAGR of 181.3% from $5.2 billion in 2016 to over $162 billion in 2020.Zacks Rank & Stock to ConsiderCurrently, Apple has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Is India the Next Big Market for Apple's (AAPL) iPhones?;3/24/2017;"Indians will soon seeApple Inc.'sAAPLiPhone 6 and 6S models packaged with a tag line of 'Assembled in India'. Yes, it's true.PerThe Wall Street Journal, the company's Taiwanese supplier - Wistron - is likely to start making the aforesaid models in the next four to six weeks at its manufacturing facility in Bengaluru, India. It should be noted that Wistron, in late Dec 2016, sought permission for expansion of its manufacturing facility from the Indian government.Though, Apple's shares were down 0.4% yesterday, it has gained 21.6% so far this year. Notably, the stock's year-to-date return is almost in line with the Zacks categorizedComputer-Miniindustry's gain of 21.5%.Why is Apple Highly Focused on India?Since 2016, Apple has been increasing its focus on India to claim a greater share of the vast smartphone market in the country, of which it reportedly holds only 2% as of now. Apple has been facing a slowdown in iPhone demand in most regions, either because of stiff competition or regulatory hurdles (China) or market saturation (the U.S). Thus, it makes sense for the company to solidify/fortify its position in India, which is projected to become the second largest smartphone market in the world.Notably, in fiscal 2016, Apple sales in India surged approximately 50% over the prior fiscal. Moreover, during its last quarterly earnings conference call, the company revealed that its smartphone sales in the country registered 51% year-over-year growth in the first three quarters of fiscal 2017.Apple, of course, is not the only tech player eyeing India for growth. Given the potential of this market, Silicon Valley's interest is well understood. From Microsoft Corp.MSFTto AlphabetGOOGL, to Facebook Inc.FB, all remain laser focused on the Indian market.Furthermore, a younger and skilled population, along with increasing investment in broadband network by the government, makes India an attractive growth opportunity for Apple over the long run. In fact, the Indian government, under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, is eager to bring foreign capital and boost manufacturing facilities in the country.The recently outlined FDI policy by Indian government also bodes well for the company as it eliminates the requirement to locally source products for at least a three-year period. This will enable Apple to open its solely-owned retail stores in India. Thereafter, the company will have to comply with the rule. In addition, company has partnered with telecom company - Reliance - which is providing its Jio (a unique all-IP network) service for free with the new iPhones.Last year, Tim Cook was on a charm offensive in India. Besides meeting Modi, he also announced the opening of an iOS App Design and Development Accelerator in Bengaluru, as well as a map development office in another Indian city - Hyderabad - in collaboration with regional firm RMSI. He was also seen hobnobbing with industrialists and movie stars during his maiden visit to the country.Will the Move Aid Apple's Cause?Per analysts, the lion's share of Apple's revenues in the country comes from devices, which are a couple of generations old. Newer models have relatively low demand given the hefty price tag. According to reports, the Apple team in India is trying to increase revenues to $3 billion by fiscal 2017-18. Also, by local assembling operations, the company can start operating its own retail outlets and avail a 10% tax benefit. This, in turn, is likely to lower prices.However, a Forbes analyst observes that even if Apple starts production locally, the prices might not come down as much. This is because, at present, only assembling operations can be carried out in India as the country lacks a robust supply chain like China. Furthermore, the analyst argues that though labor cost in the country is cheaper than China, productivity is relatively better in China. Simple assembling may not drastically bring down prices. However, if India can ""spark"" a creation of local supply chain like China, then it will be a big positive.Moreover, another analyst observes that Apple's lack of focus on regional customers' demand is a pressing concern. India is categorized by handsets that work on dual SIMs. Apparently, Apple is not keen on making dual SIM handsets. This could be a very big impediment to growth in the country. The iPhone manufacturer is already late to the party. Its rival Samsung has long been in the market, and with reportedly 23% share, it is currently the leading player in the country.Bottom LineDespite Modi's historic move of demonetizing Rs 500 and Rs 1000 currency notes to combat corruption, the company registered all-time record revenue figures in third-quarter fiscal 2017, while its various competitors were hurt by the same. In our opinion, this shows Indians' immense love for Apple's products.However, the company lags behind its competitors on the pricing front. We believe that the latest move will allow Apple evade import duty tariffs. This will enable it to price its smartphones more competitively.Furthermore, by manufacturing iPhone models in India, Apple will be able to capture considerable market share in one of the world's fastest growing economy, where it has a meager presence when compared with other rivals such as Samsung, Micromax etc.Despite the pros and cons, Apple is expected to continue its expansion drive in India. The company will be taking up a lot more initiatives this year. However, whether those initiatives yield desirable results remains a wait and watch story.Currently, Apple carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Amazon Is About to End the Competition's Only Advantage Over Alexa;3/23/2017;"E-commerce giantAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ: AMZN) has a hit on its hands with itsartificial intelligence-based Alexa virtual assistant and the products powered by the   digital darling. The Echo smart home speaker, its miniature   sibling the Dot, and the portable Tap have taken the world by   storm. Alexa was the hit of the 2017 Consumer Electronics Show,   and its family of products, which also includes the Fire TV stick   and Fire tablet, were top sellers on Amazon.com during the 2016   holiday season.If Alexa suffers from one key disadvantage, it's the lack of a   smartphone to call home. Apple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) Siri resides on the iPhone, andAlphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) Google Assistant lives on the   company's Android ecosystem. With opposingvirtual assistantstaking up residence on hundreds of millions of phones worldwide,   how would Alexa ever compete? Several recent developments are   making this disadvantage less of an issue.Just one Amazon product powered by Alexa. Image source:     Amazon.makeArticleAd();Call meRecode isreportingthat Amazon is planning upgrades that would allow Alexa-powered   devices to initiate phone calls using voice commands. This new   communication functionality would extend to other Alexa devices,   working in much the same way as an intercom. If true, this   capability would partially address the disadvantage compared to   other digital assistants, which are primarily   smartphone-based.Amazon is taking other steps to counter its virtual   assistant's marked deficiency. Amazon reveled this week that   Alexa would soon be found in Amazon's official iPhone app,   already one of the more popular downloads in Apple's app store.   Users will be able to tap the microphone button inside the Amazon   app to access Alexa, which essentially brings its myriad of   skills to the iPhone. And it won't be the only phone sporting   Alexa. Earlier this year, Chinese phone giant Huawei revealed   that its Mate 9 phone would be the ""First smartphone with Amazon   Alexa."" With these recent announcements, it probably won't be   long before Alexa is available on Google's Android phones.Alexa gets an upgrade. Image source: Amazon.In my houseEstimates for sales of the Alexa family of products vary.   Consumer Intelligence Research Partners (CIRP)estimatesthat 8.2 million US consumers own an Alexa-powered device.   Analysts at Morgan Stanley estimated total sales at 11 million by   early December 2016, but admit that number is too low, having   missed out on the high-volume Black Friday and holiday sales.   Including strong holiday sales, those numbers could be in the   range of 13 to 15 million. With an estimated 125 million   U.S. households, Alexa could be nearing a 10% penetration   rate.What have you done for me lately?Alexa's popularity seems to stem from more than the mere   novelty of the product. Amazon released a skills kit early on   that encouraged developers to create voice commands, which   connected Alexa to their products and services. Amazon recentlyannouncedthat developers had published more than 10,000 skills for the   virtual assistant, giving it the clear lead in terms of   usefulness. With that many choices, you might wonder how to find   the skills most useful to you. Alexa has that covered, with a   Skill Finder feature that also presents a ""skill of the day"" for   the asking. Other popular offerings include games like the   Potterhead quiz for Harry Potter fans, trainer tips for fans ofPokemon Go, ordering your favoriteDomino'spizza, and even help deciding what to watch on TV or at the   movies.Foolish final thoughtsAddressing the key disadvantage that stood between Alexa and   consumers is an indication of how seriously the company views its   ecosystem. The family of products have even beenprominently displayedin Amazon's growing number of bookstores. Early sales won't make   a dent in Amazon's revenue, a gargantuan $44 billion in the   company's most recent quarter, so why the big push? A recent   analyst note may provide a clue. Mark Mahaney and Jim Shaughnessy   from RBC Capital Markets predict that it could be worth an   additional $10 billion in annual sales of devices and products by   2020. With that much riding on Alexa, it's no wonder that Amazon   would go to such lengths to up its game.10 stocks we like better than AmazonWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

TripAdvisor (TRIP) Rallies on Priceline Merger Talk;3/23/2017;"On Thursday, shares of TripAdvisor, Inc.TRIPrallied on PricelinePCLNbuyout talks. TRIP is up 2.54% to $42.42 per share. These two companies are no strangers on the buyout table. Buyout rumors have occurred a few times, but no deal was struck.The trade chatter resurfaced after shares of TRIP have lost about 8.2% since its last earnings report in February. The company reported both earnings and revenue misses. Adjusted fourth quarter earnings of $0.05 per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.18 per share. TripAdvisor reported revenues of $316 million, which again missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $325 million.While it may seem like TripAdvisor has some serious work to do on the business side, the company does possess valuable assets that another online agency can benefit tremendously from.Why Would It Work?By acquiring TripAdvisor, Priceline would make itself less dependent on Alphabet's GoogleGOOGLfor traffic to their website. It would gain TripAdvisor's 390 million monthly active users, as well as the 465 million users-produced reviews and opinions that cover hotels, vacation rentals, restaurants, attractions, and experiences. While Priceline's big platform, booking.com, is popular in Europe, it lacks traffic in the U.S. With TRIP, the marketing potential and presence in the U.S. will be significantly boosted.""If you think about Priceline as mostly getting people to the destination,"" said Motley Fool Analyst Matt Argersinger. ""While TripAdvisor has things they can do when they get to the destination. Priceline becomes more of a one-stop shop.""TripAdvisor's instant booking business will also gain more recognition and leverage from Priceline's presence.Why Wouldn't It Work?While it may sound extremely beneficial for Priceline to make the buyout, it might not be that easy.TripAdvisor, Priceline, and ExpediaEXPEare considered as the three big online travel agencies. If the TripAdvisor-Priceline merger does happen, it will hurt consumers, hotels, airlines, and rental companies because only the two big companies would be dictating the terms. It may be unlikely that the Department of Justice would approve the merger.Karina Lubell, a writer for The Capitol Forum, noted, ""When the DOJ cleared Expedia-Orbitz, it had little to do with their combined market share in travel booking.""TripAdvisor has a more prominent presence compared to Orbitz, as most of the global hotel chains have signed as TripAdvisor Instant Booking partners.Furthermore, Expedia and TripAdvisor have a connection through their shareholders. Liberty InteractiveLVNTA, the venture company, has a controlling stake in both Expedia and TripAdvisor. Liberty Interactive and Barry Diller own Expedia. Greg Maffei is the CEO of Liberty Interactive and also the Chairman of TripAdvisor.Bottom LineWhile the TripAdvisor merger will suit Priceline very well, as they will receive the tools needed to strengthen their foothold in the U.S. However, there are a few obstacles ahead if Priceline does consider purchasing TRIP.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!makeArticleAd();It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

2 Stocks Hedge Funds Love;3/23/2017;"Even as the industry contracts, many of the world's   largest and most successful hedge funds remain destinations for   capital and top investing talent. Often led by seasoned and savvy   founders, these organizations are widely followed in the media   and finance industries for their stock-picking prowess.Case in point: Market research firmFactSet Research Systemspublishes a quarterly tracker of the investing activities at what   it sees as the Top 50 global hedge funds. Here's a quick rundown   of two of the most popular stocks among the hedge fund elite as   of the fourth quarter of 2016.Image source: ComcastmakeArticleAd();ComcastOwned by 22 of the top 50 hedge funds, vertically integrated   cable giantComcast(NASDAQ: CMCSA)  is one the most interesting stocks in media   today, asI discusseda few weeks ago. The reason is straightforward: Comcast is   one of the few cable companies poised to capitalize from the   increased overlap in the telecom and media industries.In the coming years, telecom companies such asAT&Tsee a major opportunity to evolve the traditional bundle of TV,   internet, and phone service into a new format in which TV   programming flows over wireless networks directly to mobile   devices. This is the underlying strategy behind AT&T's deal   to buyTime Warner. Comcast is one of the fortunate few, in addition to   AT&T, in a position to create a similar ""mobile bundle,"" much   to shareholders' benefit.Comcast owns key content assets including NBC, Bravo, CNBC,   and much more that should allow it to secure the rights to stream   cable programming over its coming mobile network. It also   has secured spectrum rights from other telecom companies and is   actively working to buy its own wireless spectrum via the FCC's   ongoing auction process.In short, hedge funds love Comcast because it's well suited to   become one of the few pure-play mobile cable operators in the   years to come.Image source: FacebookFacebookOf the 50 large hedge funds included in the survey, an   impressive 27 of them owned shares in the world's largest social   network, makingFacebook(NASDAQ: FB) the most widely held stock in FactSet's report.The bullishness is well founded. Even as Facebook has grown   into one of the world's largest publicly traded companies, its   momentum has shown no signs of slowing. Facebook has grown its   sales from $3.7 billion in fiscal 2011 to $27.6 billion in fiscal   2016, establishing itself as the only viable potential rival   toAlphabet's digital advertising empire. That's an incredible run, and one   of the more impressive growth trajectories from a large-cap   company that comes to mind.Facebook has also invested in a handful of emerging   technologies with an enviable degree of foresight. Mark   Zuckerberg and company understood the coming importance of   messaging apps as global channels for communication, commerce,   and much more develop. Many argue that messaging apps such as   Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp,Line Corp., and more will eventually become a new layer of software, akin   to the operating systems that power PC and smartphones   today. Messenger and WhatsApp -- which Facebook   acquired in February 2014 for a massive $19 billion, including   incentives -- both sport user bases of over 1 billion   monthly active users today.Facebook also spent $2 billion to acquire virtual-reality (VR)   start-up Oculus in March 2014. And though VR remains in its early   stages of development,Goldman Sachsresearch estimates that sales of VR hardware and software will   reach $80 billion by 2025.  Meanwhile, some have heralded   Facebook's $1 billion purchase of Instagram -- which has been   valued at as much at $50 billion in recent years -- as the   smartest tech acquisition of all time.Indeed, Zuckerberg is one of the world's most skilled   technology executives today. At just 32, he should be   around to benefit Facebook investors with his unique ability   for years to come. And given its unique mix of present-day   profitability and continued long-term potential, Facebook could   remain a hedge fund industry darling for quite some time.10 stocks we like better than FacebookWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

GOOGL Stock Is Falling Into a Funk;3/23/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe recent downturn inAlphabetInc(NASDAQ:GOOGL) became a little more exacerbated on Thursday morning, and now GOOGL stock is starting to dip into some dangerous territory.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockPivotal Research Group analyst Brian Wieser downgraded Alphabet shares on Monday, March 20, from ""Buy"" to ""Hold.""Wieser's issue was a number of large companies, includingMcDonald's Corporation(NYSE:MCD), bailing out their advertisements from the YouTube video platform over lack of targeting capabilities. The specific worry is that ads will be shown alongside videos from extremist and terrorist groups, as well as anything portraying hate speech.AT&T Inc(NYSE:T) andVerizon Communications Inc.(NYSE:VZ) have also pulled their ads since then. Per an AT&T spokesperson:""We are deeply concerned that our ads may have appeared alongside YouTube content promoting terrorism and hate. Until Google can ensure this won't happen again, we are removing our ads from Google's non-search platforms.""Other companies that have dropped their YouTube ads includeHSBC Holdings plc (ADR)(NYSE:HSBC),GlaxoSmithKline plc (ADR)(NYSE:GSK) andEnterprise. The price target drop - from $970 to $950 - betrayed the downgrade a little, as that still implied roughly 10% upside in GOOGL stock from there.10 Small-Cap Stocks That Could Double in the Next 3 MonthsNonetheless, shares fell hard on the news, dropping nearly 4% between then and now, including a roughly 2% drop in Thursday's early trading.GOOGL shares plunged below their short-term 20-day average initially, and today have sunk below the 50-day moving average, which has provided support for shares twice since mid-December, when the stock surged through the MA.The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has plunged to 38 - low, but still not near oversold levels.From here, GOOGL stock risks a further drop to price support around $810 - another 3% from here. Below that would be the 200-day MA, which sits just below the $800 mark.Has Apple Stock Peaked? Not Even CloseLooked at optimistically, though, Alphabet has been setting a small series of higher lows and higher highs since the beginning of the new year, precipitously dropping off in February before rebounding to hit new highs above $870 just last week.This very well could be a much-needed breather in GOOGL stock - one that has dunked the forward price-to-earnings ratio to a thoroughly digestible 21, which isn't shabby for a nearly $600 billion company that's still projected to grow revenues by double digits this year and next.As of this writing, Robert Martin did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceAMD Confirms It: Ryzen CPUs Are Locking Up PCsBank of America: BAC Stock Is a SAFETY Play?The 10 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold ForeverThe postGOOGL Stock Is Falling Into a Funkappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Has Apple Stock Peaked? Not Even Close;3/23/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAs a product and a brand,Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) seems invincible. It is doing everything right, at least at the moment. And as a result, Apple stock holders are finally seeing the go-go returns they had missed for some time.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');Source: AppleWith its iPhone 7 release, the company is capitalizing onSamsung's(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) massive Galaxy S7 Edge recall. Apple Music continues to grow subscribers. The company just refreshed its iconic iPad, by not only cutting its price but refreshing the hardware slightly.Even legendary investor Warren Buffett increased hisBerkshire Hathaway Inc.(NYSE:BRK.B) portfolio weighting in the company's shares. At a price-to-earnings ratio well below 18 and a forward P/E of just 14, is Apple cheap enough to keep moving higher?Yes … even though Apple isn't even clicking on all cylinders.iPad Sales Are on the DeclineTablet sales are dropping at a rapid clip, and Apple's iPad business is not immune. The declining popularity is not a big concern because the bigger iPhone 7 Plus alleviates any need for a tablet. The iPad Pro also fills a gap between smartphones and laptops.10 Small-Cap Stocks That Could Double in the Next 3 MonthsApple is treating the tablet market as a mature business line. After 12 consecutive quarters of falling sales, theiPad refresh at a lower pricemight be able to change that trend. The thing is, while the actual iPad has become cheaper, the iPad Mini 2 has dropped - meaning the cheapest tablet you can buy is now $60 more expensive.Strong Demand for iPhone 7On the flip side, Apple is riding strong iPhone 7 demand. In the most recent quarter, iPhone 7 Plus sales grew as a proportion of total sales. Demand was so strong that it exceed supply throughout the quarter. Apple finally balanced supply and demand levels in January.In the quarter, the company sold 78.3 million units - an all-time high for the company, and a 5% increase year-over-year.Now, with the launch of theRED iPhone 7, Apple might be able to keep up interest ahead of its new iPhone out later this year.MacBook Refresh Is UninspiringAfter many years of little change, Apple finally refreshed the Macbook Pro. The ""Touch Bar"" is the biggest change on the laptop. Unfortunately, Apple removedMagSafe, which many tech sites (likeQuartzand The Verge) and consumers dub is the smartest invention ever.Investors need not concern themselves on changes to the MacBook failing to spur sales. iPhone sales still make up the bulk of revenue and growth, while the Services division is elevating the company's profitability.iPhone 8Whispers and rumors have been going at a mile a minute surrounding an iPhone 8, marking the 10th anniversary for the successful device.One may criticize the fact that iPhone 7's only major enhancement is the improved camera. After all, the haptic home button adds no changes in its previous functionality.Expect nothing so lean from the iPhone 8.The iPhone 8 maysupportaugmented reality, virtual reality, and/or 3Dsensing. Some Android phones have so much computing and graphics processing power that they already supports these features. But that's OK. Apple has never rushed to develop new technologies - instead, it typically perfects what's already out there.Besides, there are few AR and VR apps or games that make having this tech a must-have at this time. But that will change in the next couple of years, so Apple's timing is just fine.Bottom Line on Apple StockApple is in fine shape, thus AAPL is in fine shape.AMD Confirms It: Ryzen CPUs Are Locking Up PCsWarren Buffett, legendary for his value stock picks, is holding more Apple stock than ever. The positive outlook does not even include the automotive industry adapting CarPlay, or the fact that Apple Music is highly profitable and growing.Last but not least, never discount the giant cash hoard backing Apple stock. Not only does AAPL have nearly $250 billion in cash and investments (versus $77 billion in very low-interest debt) that the company can use to finance game-changing M&A, or special dividends, or buybacks, what have you. But that cash also distorts the valuation - and in fact makes the argument that AAPL should carry a much higher P/E given just how much in raw cash it holds.Apple stock is a buy, even if gains don't come in a straight line from here.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceWednesday Apple Rumors: Hackers Plan to Wipe Millions of iPhones on April 7The 7 Most Popular Vanguard Funds for 401k Plans9 Stocks to Buy That Are Growing Faster Than AmazonThe postHas Apple Stock Peaked?

Fitbit Plunges to 52-Week Low: Three Reasons to Stay Away;3/23/2017;"Shares ofFitbit, Inc.FIThit a 52-week low of $5.42 on Mar 22.The stock declined 8.7% since it posted fourth quarter 2016 loss on Feb 22 against the ZacksElectronics - Measuring Instrumentsindustry's decline of 3.6%.Notably, the company's shares have lost a mammoth 81.6% since Jun 18, 2016, the day on which the company began trading on the New York stock exchange.Fitbit, Inc. Net Income (TTM)|Fitbit, Inc. QuoteApple Running Fitbit into the GroundFitbit's growth has been slowing down with smartwatches outshining the fitness wearable category, influx of new wearables, lack of upgrades among existing users and lackluster growth in the Asia Pacific region.Despite the broad range of devices Fitbit provides at different price points, it faces competition at both the high- and low-end products. At the high end, there is Apple'sAAPLmulti-functional Apple Watch, which renders Fitbit devices useless. There are other big manufacturers who are developing connected devices on AlphabetGOOGLowned Google's Android operating system. At the lower end, there are fitness-tracking devices from competitors like Jawbone and GarminGRMN, which also give it strong competition.With Fitbit bringing in counter strategies through the roll out new products, buying smaller companies and increasing marketing spend, its operating expenses as a percentage of revenues have increased to 53.1% in the fourth quarter of 2016 from 34% in the year-ago quarter. Increasing expenses coupled with slower revenue growth forced the company to post a net adjusted loss of 63 cents per share in the fourth quarter of 2016.Fitbit, Inc. Net Income (TTM)Recent Executive Shakeup Fails to Infuse HopeThe recent decline appears to be prompted by its announcement of an executive shakeup a few days back. With chief business officer, Woody Scal and executive vice president, Interactive, Tim Roberts, stepping down, it appears that investors are not much hopeful about the company's comeback.Concurrent with the announcement, Fitbit said that it will realign under two main businesses - Consumer Health & Fitness and Enterprise Health. The Consumer Health & Fitness business will focus on delivering more efficient health and fitness devices, diversifying into the smartwatch category and offering premium software and services.Enterprise Health, on the other hand, will enhance focus on developing and strengthening relationships with employees, insurance companies, health systems and healthcare partners. Only time will tell if these moves really work and give Fitbit a chance to make a comeback.Downward Estimate RevisionsFor the full year, five estimates have moved down in the past 60 days, compared with no upward revisions. This has caused the consensus estimate to trend lower, going from earnings of 29 cents a share 60 days ago to its current level of a loss of 62 cents.Also, for the current quarter, Fitbit has seen two downward estimate revisions versus no upward revision, which dragged the consensus estimate down to a loss of 25 cents a share from a loss of 5 cents over the past 60 days.So it may not be a good decision to keep this stock in your portfolio anymore, at least if you don't have a long-time horizon to wait.Currently, Fitbit is a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock.You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy)   stocks here.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

AT&T & Verizon Suspend Marketing Advertisements from YouTube;3/23/2017;"U.S. telecom behemothsAT&T Inc.TandVerizon Communications Inc.VZhave decided to suspend their marketing campaign on Google's YouTube site. The reason behind the decision is the appearance of their ads alongside offensive and highly controversial videos promoting adult contents, terrorism and hate speeches. Notably, Google is a division of Alphabet Inc.GOOGL.Yesterday, the two companies announced that they are suspending all their advertising from Google's non-search platforms, including YouTube as well as third-party websites that Google partners with. The withdrawal will stand until Google permanently solves the problem. So far, more than 250 companies have pulled their advertisements from YouTube including Johnson & JohnsonJNJ, the world's biggest health-care company.The decision of Verizon and AT&T is significant as telephone operators are among the biggest block of advertisers in corporate America. The two companies together spent $6.6 billion in advertisement in 2015. According to Kantar Media, Verizon and AT&T were the third and fourth largest ad spenders in the U.S. in 2016.Importantly, the two telecom giants have withdrawn their ads from Google's non-search platforms only. However, Google's search service generates the majority of its advertisement revenues which was a whopping $79.4 billion in 2016. Although Google doesn't disclose how much of its ad revenues came from YouTube, research firm eMarketer estimated it to be around $5.6 billion and has projected this figure to reach $7 billion in 2017.At this stage, it is worth mentioning that Alphabet Inc. has been in a tussle with AT&T and Verizon during the last couple of years over several regulatory issues related to broadband and data privacy. The company has significantly stepped up investments in fiber-optic broadband and wireless technologies to increase competition.Price Performance of Alphabet, AT&T and   VerizonYear-to-date, all three stocks have underperformed the Zacks categorizedComputer and Technologysector. While Alphabet gained 7.24%, AT&T and Verizon have lost 2.05% and 6.88%, respectively, in the same time frame. In contrast, the Computer and Technology sector witnessed a gain of 8.66%.

The Future of Virtual Reality: 5 Things to Know;3/22/2017;"Virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) technologies   have gotten a lot of attention over the past few years.Sony's PlayStation VR headset is shining a spotlight onthe viability of VR gaming, whileAlphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL)  Google Cardboard and new   Daydream View headsets are pushing mobile VR into the mainstream.   The unexpected success of Pokemon Go last year showed that   smartphone users are ready and willing to adopt augmented   reality. AndMicrosoft's(NASDAQ: MSFT)  development of its HoloLens goggles aim to   prove that the virtual and augmented worlds will soon become a   part of our reality.Investors looking to benefit from these two intertwined   markets should keep these five things in mind:Image source: Google.makeArticleAd();1. The future of VR could be our next computing     platformMuch of the attention surrounding virtual reality right now   has to do mainly with how it will be used for gaming, filmmaking,   or other entertainment content. ButFacebook(NASDAQ: FB) CEO Mark Zuckerberg believes that VR could surpass   all of these categories.He said in a Bloomberginterviewlast year that VR is ""a good candidate to be the next major   computing platform."" Zuckerberg thinks it'll take a while for us   to get there (more on that later), but he's optimistic that VR   could be a primary form of communication technology in the near   future:Photos are richer than text; video, much richer than photos.     But that's not the end, right? I mean, it's like this     indefinite continuum of getting closer and closer to being able     to capture what a person's natural experience and thought is,     and just being able to immediately capture that and design it     however you want and share it with whomever you want.2. It will take a while for VR to gain     tractionVR is still in its very early stages, and it's likely that it   will take many more years before it becomes mainstream --   Zuckerberg has put the timeframe at five to 10 years.Adding to the slow pace is the fact that some hyped   technologies, like Magic Leap's AR headset, have recently been   found to be behind schedule.The Informationreported(subscription required) at the end of the last year that Magic   Leap -- which has raised $1.4 billion in funding in about three   years -- pivoted away from some of its earlier fiber optic   technologies and now trails the image quality of Microsoft's   HoloLens.And even the HoloLens, which currently costs $3,000 and is   mainly for developers, has sold only thousands of units. Roger   Walkden, Microsoft's HoloLens commercial lead,recently toldThe Inquirerthat, ""We're not trying to sell hundreds of thousands or millions   or anything, it's expensive, and it's not in huge numbers. So   we're happy with the level of sales that we've got -- I can't   tell you anything about the numbers, but it's in thousands, not   hundreds of thousands, and that's fine. That's all we need.""While Microsoft may be pleased with those numbers, it's still   a clear indicator that VR and AR have a long way go before they   become mainstream.And then there's the recent news that Facebook's Oculus is   shutting down 200 of its 500 demo sites within Best Buy   stores, reportedly due to thelack of public interest. The future may be virtual, but we're getting there slowly.3. It offers a new way of seeing our worldJason Pontin, the editor of MIT'sTechnology Review,recentlyinterviewedJessica Brillhart, a filmmaker for virtual reality at   Google, and talked with her about how VR is currently used and   what it might become in the near future. When asked if   people will eventually use VR to record home videos, Brillhart   responded that we probably would but that it might not be a good   thing,Think of everything you forget about a birthday party when     you're a kid. But now the rig would capture everything. You     could watch someone you loved respond the way she used to, or     eat cake a certain way. It is going to be interesting to see     what happens when we aren't able to forget anything     anymore.The interview is a good reminder that VR is still in its early   stages and it's still unclear how this platform will be used, and   whether or not we'll like exactly how it turns out.4. Virtual reality could eventually impact all of the     sensesRight now, VR is limited to a user's visual and auditory   senses, but in the future this will likely be enhanced.   The general manager of Dell's gaming PC manufacturer   Alienware, Frank Azor, said thisin an interviewwith TIME last year:Once you begin catering to the rest of the senses, like what     we feel body-wise, temperature-wise, and smell, the reality     factor of virtual reality [becomes] stronger and the virtual     piece begins to fade.Breaking the barrier between the virtual world and the   physical world with high-end touch sensors could be the next step   in virtual reality, and it won't be here for a while, but VR   hardware and software makers are already thinking about how this   technology can go from immersive to fully interactive.5. The market potential for both AR and VR could be     hugeThe virtual reality market was worth about $1.9 billion in   2016, but that's expected to climb to $22.4 billion by 2020.   Those numbers include both software and hardware sales. And when   you factor in AR sales, the market skyrockets even higher. The   combined AR and VR market will be worth $121 billion by 2021,   according to Digi-Capital.In that same year, IDC estimates more than 99 million AR and   VR headsets will be shipped, up from just 10 million last year,   which represents a 58% compound annual growth rate between 2016   and 2021..The good news for investors is that companies are just getting   started with AR and VR, which meansthe opportunities to benefit haven't passed. There are still plenty of unknowns, but as more companies rally   around these new technologies and make the necessary investments   to get them off of the ground, we're likely to see the future of   AR and VR develop substantially over the next few years.10 stocks we like better than FacebookWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Is Alphabet Stock a Good Way to Invest in Self-Driving Cars?;3/22/2017;"Three things seem pretty clear at this point in history:Self-driving cars will begin coming to market before     long.They'll generate huge profits for some companies.Google has been a leader in developing self-driving     technology.But does it follow that Google's parent,Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) , will reap the rewards of its   technological leadership? Or put another way, are the potential   profits from self-driving cars a reason to add Alphabet's stock   to your portfolio?A lot of commentators seem to think so, but I'm very   skeptical. Here's why.makeArticleAd();Driverless ""panda cars"" were the public face of the Google     Self-Driving Car Project for several years. Image source:     Alphabet.Alphabet has what looks like a leadership position...Google began tinkering with self-driving cars way back in   2009, long before many investors began taking the technology   seriously. The original team behind what became knows as the   Google Self-Driving Car Project included several robotics   all-stars who seemed ready to invent the future. The whole thing   appeared to be decades beyond what the established automakers   were doing.For a while, it was. Of course, in the last few years, some   automakers and auto-industry suppliers have invested heavily in   the technology and made significant gains. But even so,   Alphabet's self-driving unit, which was spun out of Google and   renamed Waymo late last year, retains some big advantages:By at least one measure -- ""disengagements,"" the number of     times a human driver has to take control of a self-driving test     car -- Waymo made major progress last year andappears to be aheadof most known rivals.Maps. The first self-driving cars to come to market will     rely heavily on highly detailed maps as a backup to their     sensors. Google has been mapping the world in ever-increasing     detail for years; Waymo will have access to those maps, while     its competitors will have to look elsewhere.Waymo has developed its own self-driving sensor hardware,     including -- crucially -- LIDAR units that cost much less than     current commercially available units.Those are significant advantages. But there's a big question   that might not be obvious to investors who don't have a deep   understanding of the auto industry:How will Waymo bring all of that to market?Waymo's current test fleet was built in partnership with     FCA, but the companies have disclosed no plans to collaborate     on production vehicles. Image source: Fiat Chrysler Automobiles     NV....but bringing it to market may prove complicatedWaymo's CEO, John Krafcik, is a respected auto-industry   veteran who was hired to lead the project in September 2015.   Krafcik brought a welcome dose of realistic transparency to the   project when he made it clear that Alphabet has no intention of   manufacturing its own vehicles. Instead, he said, Waymo would   seek to bring its technology to market via partnerships with   established automakers.There's just one problem: The automakers aren't exactly   beating down Krafcik's door. In fact, the auto executives I've   talked with feel that they have very good reasons to steer clear   of a deal with Waymo, starting with control of the data generated   by self-driving cars.It's almost an understatement to say that automakers areveryaware of the smartphone precedent. The phone makers that chose to   adopt the Android operating system ended up making hardware on   very slim margins. Alphabet ended up with most of the profits,   because Android provided it with the (immensely valuable) users'   data.Auto executives don't want to end up in the same boat, and   they know that they'll soon have alternatives that will allow   them to keep at least some control of the data. At least one   alternative, a partnership betweenDelphi Automotive(NYSE: DLPH) ,Intel(NASDAQ: INTC) , andMobileye(NYSE: MBLY) , aims to have a self-driving system available to   any automaker that wants it by the end of 2019. That partnership   will allow automakers to retain much of the data, and auto   executives see it as homegrown -- created largely by   established industry suppliers, not by Silicon Valley   hotshots.Given that, why go with Waymo?That said, a couple of big automakers have kicked the tires on   Waymo's technology:Fiat Chrysler Automobiles(NYSE: FCAU) worked with Google engineers last year to createthe latest vehicles for Waymo's test fleet, based on the well-regarded Chrysler Pacifica minivan --     but there's no sign that the two will move forward on anything     that could lead to a product for sale.Honda(NYSE: HMC) issued a somewhat odd announcement in December     saying that it was ""entering into formal discussions"" with     Waymo, though nothing (so far) seems to have resulted from     those discussions. (I speculated at the time that Honda's     announcement might have been aboutprodding other potential partners to take     action. But at least as of right now, it's not clear exactly what was     going on there.)Waymo may well find a profitable line of business in selling   its sensors to other companies. And it's likely that some   automaker, somewhere, will eventually give its self-driving   system a try.But unless other research and development efforts hit   roadblocks that Waymo is somehow able to skirt, it seems unlikely   that it will be a dominant player in self-driving systems anytime   in the near future.The upshot: Don't buy Alphabet just for self-drivingThere are plenty of good reasons to consider adding Alphabet   to your portfolio. But if you're looking for a targeted   self-driving investment, Alphabet probably isn't it: As of right   now, it's not clear that Waymo will ever add much to the search   giant's bottom line.10 stocks we like better than AlphabetWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Buy the Baidu Inc (ADR) (BIDU) Stock Dip;3/22/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsChinese tech companyBaidu Inc (ADR)(NASDAQ:BIDU) has been called ""the Google of China,"" but BIDU stock's steady decline over the past six months suggests that the company is nowhere near comparable toAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG,NASDAQ:GOOGL).makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockIn mid-February, BIDU looked to be on the upswing, but the firm'sfourth-quarter earningsdealt a heavy blow to Baidu stock.With BIDU shares down nearly 10% from where they were a month ago, however, this dip could translate into a buying opportunity.Baidu EarningsIt's true that Baidu reported less-than-stellar earnings last month. The company's quarterly revenue came in a $2.6 billion, which represents a decline of more than 2% from last year's figures.5 Big Financial Stocks That Just Got Leveled (And What to Do Next)Even more concerning was the fact that online marketing customers declined 18.6% in 2016. For investors that consider BIDU to be the Chinese Google, that's a huge deal. Advertising dollars are everything to search engines like Baidu and Google.It's Not as Bad as It LooksThose figures are certainly scary, but when you look at the reason behind them things start to look a little bit rosier. It's important to note that BIDU faced some major headwinds last year, including a big change to China's advertising regulations. The cost to comply with the new rules was significant for Baidu, whichgenerates around 96% of its revenue from advertising.Not only did the new regulations hit BIDU's revenue hard, but they also hurt the firm's customers numbers. The new regulations include strict rules regarding how companies advertise and some of Baidu's current customers weren't able to meet those requirements, which resulted in a loss.However, there could be a silver lining in there for BIDU as the new requirements will help the firm identify who its quality customers are. If you look at per-customer spend, you'll see that those who were able to meet the new guidelines actually spent about 14% more than they had in the fourth quarter of 2015.Huge Growth Potential for BIDU StockWhat's important to note here is that even if BIDU is struggling now, there is a huge growth opportunity for internet companies in China. While you might think that a search engine doesn't have room to expand any further, keep in mind that China is pretty far behind the U.S. when it comes to internet users.  Just over 50% of the nation's populationhas access to the internet.That's a big deal, because it means that as the internet makes its way further afield, advertisers are going to be willing to pay to reach even more people. Eventually, online advertising will be the best way to reach the majority of Chinese residents, and marketers will have to pay for that.Bottom Line on BIDU StockNot only does BIDU have a lot of growth potential in its core business, but the firm has been investing heavily in hot new technology like artificial intelligence and self-driving vehicles. While advertising revenue still makes up the bulk of Baidu's bottom line, we could see big-time benefits from the firm's focus on the future.The company's efforts to develop self-driving technology are particularly enticing because the cars' navigation systems will be equipped to deal with China's complicated traffic conditions. That means that once the vehicles are roadworthy, tweaking their technology to make them usable on U.S. roads will be far easier than trying to do it the other way around.Baidu Inc (ADR) (BIDU) Stock Is Just Giving Away MoneyBIDU's fourth-quarter results were definitely scary on the surface, but things aren't as bad as the market would have you believe. If you have ever considered buying BIDU stock, now is the time to do it.As of this writing, Laura Hoy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace8 Places to Run and Hide in a Market Crash10 Safe Dividend Stocks to Own During the Next Market CrashThe postBuy the Baidu Inc (ADR) (BIDU) Stock Dipappeared first onInvestorPlace."

FANG Stocks are Back in Focus;3/22/2017;"A while ago someone noticed that if you took the first letters of the names of the four big modern tech companies, Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Google (GOOG:GOOGL) they spelled out a wonderful acronym, FANG. Of course, since then Google has gone and spoiled it all by rebranding their holding company as alphabet, but the acronym has stuck.At the risk of spoiling that alphabetic synergy I would add Apple (AAPL) to the list, given that companies role as the largest of the tech stocks. In fact some people substitute Apple for Amazon and obviously if you do that you still get FANG rather than the less appealing FAANG. For argument’s sake, let’s assume that all five stocks are still collectively known as the fang stocks, and right now they look like a good place to be.The reason, though, is less about tech, or indeed about business at all, than it is about politics. The market seems to be driven at the moment by what comes out of the White House. Since the election there has been a lot of faith placed by traders and investors in certain policies outlined by the new administration and the Republicans who dominate Congress during the campaign; a “beautiful” replacement for Obamacare, for example, as well as tax reform and infrastructure spending.makeArticleAd();Yesterday’s drop in the stock market, the biggest of the year so far, was reportedly triggered by worries about the healthcare bill slated to replace the Affordable Care Act. It has met with opposition from within the Republican Party, particularly from the Right, and needs some serious negotiation in order to just pass the House.That in itself would be a bad thing if repeal went ahead without the replacement passed, as most acknowledge that something has to fill the vacuum.More worrying for the market, though, is that if this bill fails, it will indicate that the fiscal conservatives in Congress are sticking to their principles, making stimulative infrastructure spending a virtual non-starter.Some of the biggest losers yesterday were in the industrial and material sectors that have gained the most since the election and which would be hurt most by delays in infrastructure spending. The reason the fang stocks look so attractive right now is because policy delays regarding healthcare and infrastructure spending will have little effect on them in the short term, but things like tax reform when it does come, especially the possibility of the repatriation of overseas profits, will make an enormous difference. The consensus is that tax reform is an area that unites the party and thus could be even hastened by a split over the Obamacare replacement.The fly in the ointment could be that much of the potential growth for these firms lies in overseas expansion, in particular to emerging economies. That would be a worry if the White House does push for more isolationist trade relationships, but again the fact that the Freedom Caucus free market types in the GOP are flexing their muscles would suggest that any eventual move would have to be negotiated, and therefore moderated from the campaign rhetoric.All in all, then, things look good for Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google. That belief seems to have taken hold today as each of the tech big five has bucked the downward trend of the broader market and gained in early trading. Of course one swallow doth not a summer make, but the logic behind these stocks’ contrarian behavior is hard to refute and they may prove to be a hedge against politics driven uncertainty over the next few weeks, or even months."

Does Facebook's Video Strategy Make It a Top Growth Stock?;3/22/2017;"Yesterday,FacebookFBwas assigned a Buy rating by BTIG analyst Rich Greenfield, who was quoted by media reports saying, ""Not having a buy [rating] on Facebook has clearly been a mistake in 2017."" He further added that ""the secular trends toward mobile devices globally and the accelerating shift of ad dollars are simply too strong to ignore.""Facebook's Video StrategySince last year, Facebook has been aggressively promoting live video content on its platform. Online video is emerging as a big opportunity to boost ad revenues. Ad revenues contribute over 95% to Facebook's total revenue. Earlier, it was reported that the company is looking to grab a share of the reportedly $70 billion brand advertising that is allocated to linear TV by increasing video content on its platform.  At its last earnings call, Facebook said that video has emerged as a ""megatrend"" on the same lines like mobile.Last year, the company signed deals with media houses and Internet celebrities to churn out more content for its live platform and added a plethora of new features to Facebook live.  These include enabling broadcast for a Group or Event and at the same time allowing audience to respond to the live broadcast in real time through Live Reactions. Also, recently, it brought on board an ex-MTV executive,Mina Lefevre, to increase original live video content on the platform.In fact, it has been on a signing spree to bring more live video content, especially sports. Streaming, particularly live sports, is one of the most lucrative opportunities as it helps to boost engagement levels (especially millennials) and brings more advertisers. Facebook has struck a deal with MLB and has collaborated with Univision Communications Inc. to live stream 46 Liga MX games for an undisclosed amount.Mobile and live video efforts are paying off big time for the social media giant.  In the last reported quarter, revenues of $8.8 billion increased 51% year over year. Advertising revenues were $8.629 billion, surging 53% year over year.Mobile ad revenues in the quarter were $7.2 billion (up 61% year over year), contributing 84% to total ad revenues.Facebook, Inc. PriceFacebook, Inc. Price|Facebook, Inc. QuoteEven Instagram has emerged as a big cash cow with over 500,000 advertisers. It is the second big ad platform after Facebook's namesake platform, though the company has so far refrained from providing actual ad numbers for Instagram. The latest Instagram-feature ""Stories"", though a SnapchatSNAPclone, looks set to lure more advertisers this year. Instagram boasts over 600 million MAUs and over 400 million DAUs while ""Stories"" on the platform have 150 million daily actives.At the last earnings call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg continued to emphasize on bringing more video content to the platform. He also informed that the company has been investing on original content and that it will keep doing the same this year as well. Facebook is also beta-testing mid roll ads in its video content to boost its ad revenues.Though Facebook's video strategy looks good on paper, it will be one big task to actually make it work given a number of challenges. Per media reports, ""professional content producers, such as CNN, HBO and Comedy Central, presents a higher quality, which garners deeper engagement and ad dollars"" and this where Facebook might suffer. Also, the competition for ad dollars from the likes of Alphabet'sGOOGLYouTube, TwitterTWTRand Snapchat is also unnerving.Plus, the fake news dissemination problem on its platform has been a raging controversy all through the last year. Fake news problem will definitely impact attracting advertisers.Our TakeContinuous rise in advertising revenues as well as its strategic efforts to sustain the growth momentum has put Facebook on investors' favorite stock pick list. Notably, in the past one year, Facebook's shares have generated a return of 23.39%, compared with the ZacksInternet Servicesindustry's return of 9.11%.Furthermore, Facebook has aGrowth StyleScore of ""A"". We note that our Growth Style Score encompasses all the essential metrics from a company's financial statements to get a true sense of the quality and sustainability of growth. Moreover, our research shows that stocks with Growth Style Scores of 'A' or 'B' has high chances of growing further.Therefore, although there are numerous challenges, we believe that Facebook will continue to retain its leadership position in the internet advertising space with its innovative ideas.At present, Facebook carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy)   stocks here.5 Trades Could Profit ""Big-League"" from Trump   PoliciesIf the stocks above spark your interest, wait until you look into companies primed to make substantial gains from Washington's changing course.Today Zacks reveals 5 tickers that could benefit from new trends like streamlined drug approvals, tariffs, lower taxes, higher interest rates, and spending surges in defense and infrastructure.See these buy recommendations now >>Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The Google Ad Controversy:  Should it Matter to Investors?;3/22/2017;"Alphabet Inc.'sGOOGLGoogle is currently in the news regarding the issue of ads emerging next to YouTube videos that display homophobic and anti-Semitic contents.The UK Government called upon Google last Thursday after ads for taxpayer-funded bodies like The Royal Air Force, The Royal Navy and BBC appeared next to ""extremist"" YouTube videos.The Government has suspended all its advertising from Google until further confirmation about those ads no longer appearing against questionable contents. The stock has lost 2.4% since, against the ZacksInternet-Servicesindustry's loss of 0.11%.Google has been summoned for the second time this week to provide the government an update of the efforts it has been making to ensure that ads appear in undisputed environments.Google's Initial Response Seemed a Bit WeakGoogle did give an explanation in a blog post the next day, stating that the company has policies to debar ads from appearing on pages or videos with offensive or derogatory contents. But implementation is not always easy, given the millions of sites in its network. Moreover, 400 hours of video get uploaded to Youtube every minute, which makes the implementation doubly difficult. The company, however, said that it had already initiated a review of the problem.Nevertheless, the investor community did not seem satisfied with a ""half-hearted"" explanation. A rating downgrade came the very next working day, with Pivotal Research analyst Brian Wieser downgrading Google parent Alphabet from ""Buy"" to ""Hold"".Adding to Google's troubles, the issue that primarily appeared to be centered on the U.K, went global in no time, with over 250 brands suspending their advertising on Youtube. The list includes big names from private as well as public sectors-Transport for London, The FCA, HSBCHSBC, ToyotaTM, McDonald'sMCD, Heinz, The guardian, Channel 4, , L'Oreal, Marks & Spencer, Hargreaves Lansdown and Sainsbury's.A Clear Policy Revamp Announcement FollowedThe severity of the issue forced Google to make some ""serious"" announcements the following day. The company posted some notable policy revamps that include a commitment to more fine-tuned advertiser controls, adding safer defaults, expanding video-level reporting for advertisers and increaseing investments to implement its ad policies faster.Google also mentioned its plans to add a significant number of staff and deploy latest Artificial Intelligence (AI) powered tools to assess dubious content.Should Investors be Wary?Google is embroiled in a legal battle across practically all continents and issues like this are likely to add to its woes, at least in the short haul. Apart from being a huge drain on ad revenues, these give it a bad name.Alphabet Inc. Revenue (TTM)Alphabet Inc. Revenue (TTM)|Alphabet Inc. QuoteNevertheless, the company has had extraordinary success in the courtroom and with government officials around the world. But developments like these are worth keeping an eye on and remain an overhang on the shares, at least for the time being.In the long run, we don't believe the issue will pose any severe threat to the company, given Google's long history of execution, leading search market share and growing focus on innovation, strategic acquisitions and android OS. With huge cash balance and technological prowess, the company has the flexibility to pursue growth in any area that exhibits true potential.Currently, Alphabet has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock is Autohome Inc.

Internap, GCP Applied Technologies, Twitter and Google highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day;3/22/2017;"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL - March 22, 2017 -Zacks Equity ResearchhighlightsInternap(NASDAQ:INAP-Free Report) as the Bull of the Day,GCP Applied Technologies( NYSE:GCP-Free Report) as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis onTwitter Inc.(NYSE:TWTR-Free Report)andGoogle(NASDAQ:GOOGL-Free Report).Here is a synopsis of all four stocks:Bull of the Day:Internap(NASDAQ:INAP-Free Report) is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and has an ""A"" for both Growth and Momentum. The stock has been bouncing up against 52 week highs and looks to continue to do more of the same. It is the Bull of The Day today.DescriptionInternap Corporation provides information technology infrastructure services. It operates through two business segments, Data Center Services and Internet Protocol (IP) Services. The Data Center Services segment provides colocation services comprising physical space within data centers and associated services, such as power, interconnection, environmental controls, monitoring, and security. Internap Corporation was founded in 1996 and is headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia.Sticking With What WorksThere is little doubt that we are in a long term bull market. One of the best ways to play this market is by buying the stocks that are seeing positive developments and are hitting new highs. INAP has both of these even and the market breaks a long streak of days without a 1% drawdown.Earnings HistoryThe earnings history isn't exactly a stellar one. I see two beats and two misses in the last four outings. None of the last four reports saw the company outperform on the top line either. But something did catch my eye.The most recent report was a beat of $0.03 which translated into a positive earnings surprise of 20%. This solid beat caused the stock to jump more than 31% in the session following the release. That has a way of making the chart look great!EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for CY2017 saw a huge boost following the most recent earnings report. The number moved from a loss of $0.57 in January to a loss of $0.52 in February and is now at a loss of just $0.34. That is a big move in the right direction.The CY18 number has also seen a dramatic move higher, going from a loss of $0.50 to a loss of $0.24 and settling at a loss of $0.16 over the same time period.If the company continues to beat expectations, profitability could come by the end of the year.ValuationWithout the benefit of positive earnings we don't get to lean on the PE for our look at valuation. Instead we have to look at the conservative measure of price to book which has the stock trading at a discount to the market. INAP trades at about 4x book, but the industry average is trading closer to 6.5x. The more aggressive measure of price to sales show the stock trading at 0.7x compared to a 6.2x industry average. Both of these metrics show considerable room for growth.Bear of the Day:GCP Applied Technologies( NYSE:GCP-Free Report) is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). The company has missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last three quarters and it is the Bear of the Day today.DescriptionGCP Applied Technologies Inc. offer specialty construction chemicals and building materials as well as packaging technologies. GCP Applied Technologies Inc. is headquartered Cambridge, Massachusetts.Most Recent QuarterDespite GCP missing the most recent quarter, the stock jumped more than 25% in the session following the release.The company reported EPS of $0.29 when $0.30 was expected. The 1 cent miss translates into a -3.3% negative earnings surprise. Revenues came in $5M under expectations for a 1.3% negative revenue surprise.Division Being SoldAt the same time of the earnings release, the company noted that they entered into an agreement to sell their Darex Packaging Technologies business to $1.05B to Henkel. The transaction is expected to close in the middle of 2017.The sale of the business likely means that estimates will be chopped. The question is will the stock see a similar move when investors realize that while GCP may be flush with cash the entire company is trading at a value of just over $2.3B at about $33 per share.Additional content:Twitter Bot Scandal Puts Further Pressure on CEO     DorseyJack Dorsey, CEO of Twitter Inc.(NYSE:TWTR-Free Report)is facing another problem in convincing advertisers to return to Twitter, as new research showed that up to 15% of Twitter's 319 million users can be bots rather than human.The research was conducted by University of Southern California and Indiana University. Researchers used more than 1,000 features to identify bot accounts on Twitter. It was estimated that between 9% and 15% of active Twitter accounts are bots.The estimate of 15% is almost twice of Twitter's own estimates. In Twitter's Q4 earnings, the company reported up to 8.5% of accounts could be bots.Twitter is hit particularly hard by this research because the company is already struggling to persuade advertisers to come back. Dorsey, one of the site's co-founders, came back in 2015 as chief executive and hopes to turn around the company's fortune; however, little progress has been made.The company is still far away from making its first profit and stale user growth.The loss from operation of fourth quarter was $143 million, compared to $67 million during the same time last year. Twitter also reported just 4% growth to 319 million monthly active users year-over-year.The company's performance and the bot scandal puts further pressure on Dorsey to step down as Twitter's CEO.A Twitter spokesperson recognized that bot accounts often have negative connation but can be extremely beneficial, like those that automatically alert people of natural disasters or from customer service points of view.While the researchers agreed on the benefits of the bot accounts, they also pointed out, ""there is a growing record of malicious applications of social bots. Some emulate human behavior to manufacture fake grassroots political support… and promote terrorist propaganda and recruitment.""This is a problem that not only Twitter is having but all social media platforms, as Google's(NASDAQ:GOOGL-Free Report)YouTube is currently suffering from ads placement issues with its advertisers.Twitter closed the day at $15.09 per share, up 0.07%.Zacks' 2017 IPO Watch ListBefore looking into the stocks mentioned above, you may want to get a head start on potential tech IPOs that are popping up on Zacks' radar.

Irrational Demands: Of Anchors, Pearls, and Procrastination;3/22/2017;"(0:20) - Dan Ariely: Predictably Irrational(4:10) - Do first impressions get imprinted on us?(6:30) - Arbitrary Coherence: Why do we accept anchors?(12:00) - Are price tags anchors?(14:30) - Dan Ariely: Payoff(16:40) - What gets scheduled, gets done.Welcome back to Mind Over Money. I'm Kevin Cook, your field guide and story teller for the fascinating arena of Behavioral Economics.Today we're going to focus on the work of Dan Ariely, author ofPredictably Irrational. When he published the book in 2008, Ariely was a professor of Behavioral Economics at MIT. Now, he's Professor of Psychology and Behavioral Economics at Duke University and he also is the founder of The Center for Advanced Hindsight. Ariely's TEDtalks have been watched over 7.8 million times.We've talked before about the cognitive bias calledanchoring. Ariely has picked up where the forefathers of Behavioral Economics like Daniel Kahneman and Richard Thaler left off by doing new experiments to find out how prevalent this bias really is.In the podcast, I read from Chapter 2 of Predictably Irrational, titled ""The Fallacy of Supply and Demand: Why the Price of Pearls - and Everything Else - Is Up in the Air.""Ariely begins with a story about the ""pearl king"" Salvador Assael who achieved a remarkable marketing feat in the 1970s New York luxury jewelry scene by making so-called black pearls from Tahiti into a nearly precious gem.He tells this story to help explain the power ofprice anchorsin decision making, especially when the initial price reference is completely arbitrary, and thus, irrational.Then he describes an experiment he conducted with colleagues at MIT in the first decade of the 21st century. The researchers used a class of 55 marketing MBA students to conduct a specialized auction where the participants were first asked to write down the last two digits of their social security numbers.The act of writing down those digits had a surprising overall impact on the results of the auction, which included fine wines, computer equipment, and chocolate. Listen to the podcast and hear me read an excerpt from Dan's book that I hope inspires you to read it yourself.The GAF EconomyAriely's experiments with price anchors and buying decisions got me thinking about my favorite ""big brothers"" and hoarders of tons of data on consumer buying behavior:Alphabet(GOOGL),Amazon(AMZN), andFacebook(FB).I bet Ariely would love to have access to these databases for virtually unlimited testing. Note to self: see if Dan is looking for research partners in this ocean of data.Followers of my stock research and trading articles know that I often talk about The GAF Economy comprised of Google, Amazon, and Facebook. My focus is on the behemoths who have changed our entertainment, education, shopping and entrepreneurship with a digital deluge of information and marketing opportunities.Together, Google and Facebook will break the $100 billion mark this year in advertising revenues according to market research firm eMarketer. Google broke the $50 billion mark a few years ago and Facebook topped $26 billion in 2016.Their combined 2017 haul will command over a 46% share of advertisers' total global digital ad spend. Just think about the volume of consumer purchases triggered by that $100 billion in ad spend.And if you have been listening to me about digital advertising growth in the past year, you know that Facebook is not stealing market share from Google in that growth. Together, they are expanding the pie as tons of small and medium-sized businesses realize the power of digitally-targeting audiences and geographies, efficient ads testing, and fine-tuning of their ad budgets.Welcome to the JungleAnd in the ""retail rainforest"" that is Amazon, consumers continue to adopt its convenient platform for more purchases -- at the expense of traditional retailers. Amazon's total annual revenues grew 27% last year to $136 billion as it was responsible for possibly one-fourth of all online transactions in the US.Testifying to that reach, according to web marketing services provider BloomReach, 55% of consumers started their product searches on Amazon in 2016, up from 44% in 2015.And here are some amazing stats from Amazon's Q4 report...Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) delivered more than two billion units on behalf of sellers in 2016, and the number of active sellers using FBA grew more than 70%. Using the FBA service, Amazon sellers from more than 130 countries fulfilled orders to customers in 185 countries.In 2016, there were over 100,000 sellers with sales of more than $100,000 selling on Amazon.To help put Amazon's share of retail sales in some perspective - I say ""some"" because the company doesn't break out their revenues clearly enough for us to know for sure -- let me share some paragraphs from an October USA Today article titledAmazon could be a lot bigger than we think...In the United States, total annual retail sales are about $5   trillion, with the Department of Commerce estimating 8% of that   is e-commerce. That puts total online sales at around $400   billion, and Amazon's share at 15% (for domestic revenues   only).Amazon's retail revenue, however, doesn't reflect the full   value of the items sold on Amazon by other retailers. These are   companies that use Amazon as an online sales venue, sometimes   their only one. Amazon says 49% of its units sold come from   third-party sellers.The company may actually be handling double that amount - 20%   to 30% of all U.S. retail goods sold online - thanks to the   volume of sales it transacts for third parties on its website and   app. Only a portion of those sales add to its revenue.""The punchline is that Amazon's twice as big as people give   them credit for, because there's this iceberg under the surface,   but you only see the tip,"" said Scot Wingo, executive chairman of   Channel Advisor, an e-commerce software company that works with   thousands of online sellers.When third-party sales are taken into account, Amazon's share   of what U.S. shoppers spend online could be as high as $125   billion yearly, and it could represent close to 30% of the online   goods Americans buy, according to an analysis of Amazon's   financial statements.Gene Munster, a senior analyst at Piper Jaffray, estimates   Amazon touches 30% of total e-commerce in the United States, and   its share is growing.""Amazon's just going to slowly grab more and more of your   wallet,"" he said.Again, Dan Ariely if you are listening, we need to study the buying data and behavior of the GAF Economy. There must thousands of A/B split tests just sitting there waiting with evidence of how predictably irrational we are.A Surprisingly Simple Solution for   ProcrastinationFinally, at the end of my podcast I introduce Ariely's latest book,Payoff: The Hidden Logic That Shapes Our Motivations. I share a productivity secret from Dan that could literally change your life. It's a real golden nugget that will help you control, if not crush, procrastination. Or should I call it a black pearl?Make the time to read Ariely's book. If you liked Freakonomics for the way it gave you new perspectives about society and human behavior via statistics, you'll lovePredictably Irrationalfor its ability to go inside our decision making.And be sure to listen to the podcast for that ""productivity pearl.""

AMD's (AMD) Success Is Not The Death Of Intel (INTC);3/22/2017;"My article on Tuesday, which highlighted (some might say “boasted”) the recent achievements of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), was perceived by some readers as an attack on Intel (INTC). But that was the intent.While I’m admittedly an unabashed cheerleader of Intel, I can still appreciate the rags-to-riches story that AMD CEO Lisa Su has successfully executed since her appointment in January 2012. AMD stock traded at $5.40 at the time. The stock recently made a 52-week high of $15.55. Save for the people at AMD headquarters, no one anticipated this remarkable turnaround. But what’s good for AMD is also good for Intel since a excitement surrounding chip battles increases consumer interest.Notably, this renewed battle comes even as the rate of PC revenue continues to decline. In other words, both companies, which struggled at the height of the mobile era, have moved beyond being just PC shops. And while AMD continues to make impressive leaps, Intel is still the leader. The extent to which AMD pushes Intel to innovate, the better off Intel will be. And that’s exactly what Intel CEO Brian Krzanich has begun to demonstrate.makeArticleAd();Looking to avoid the another mobile-type miss, Intel is pushing heavily to be future-ready. Fresh off its second mega-deal in less than two years, Krzanich — in his fifth year at the helm — seems intent on putting Intel’s cash to use. The company’s$15.3 billion acquisitionof Israeli self-driving technology company Mobileye (MBLY) was the most recent example. This follows $16.7 billion deal for Altera back in 2015.These two deals suggest that Intel is not worried about what AMD is doing. It can be argued that it should. But Krzanich, who has found ways to get Intel’s top line growing again, has shown to have a good pulse on what the company needs. Not only does Intel, thanks to Altera, now have an inside track on the Internet of Things and data center market, Mobileye now puts Intel in the driver's seat in the realm of autonomous cars, allowing it to better compete with Tesla (TSLA) and Google (GOOGL).In both acquisitions, however, market pundits, who were unable to immediately see the financial benefits, criticize Intel for overpaying. But, recall, Google was laughed at for buying YouTube in 2006 for $1.65 billion. Today YouTube is worth anestimated $40 billiontoday. Likewise, Facebook (FB) was criticized for taking out Instagram. But assuming Intel can realize the estimated $70 billion total addressable market of driverless cars by 2030, Mobileye could prove to be a bargain.In short, AMD’s improvements don’t spell the doom of Intel. The management of both companies are executing on their stated operating objectives. And both stocks should perform well in the next 12 to 18 months. As to which stock is right for you? That all depends on where your allegiance is."

As AAPL Stock Hits All-Time High, Apple Launches Red iPhone, New iPad;3/21/2017;"Apple Inc.AAPLopened the day at an all-time high at $142.15 per share with the release of a new color of the iPhone 7, new video app, and new iPad.New ProductsThe first product is a special edition Red iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, from the partnership with the Red project to raise funds to fight AIDS. Apple has previously released other products in support of Red, but this is the first time that the company is pairing Red with its most popular item. Apple recorded 78.3 million iPhones sold in the first quarter of 2017.The special new iPhone will be available in stores and online starting Friday for a limited time. Apple didn't specify on the timeframe for the Red iPhone and what percentage of the sales will be donated.Apple also announced a new video app, called Clips. It lets users create a montage of videos, photos, and music with filters, emoji, text, animated titles and narration to be saved to users' phone or shared directly to Facebook Inc.FB, Instagram, Snap's SnapchatSNAP, Alphabet's YouTubeGOOGLand TwitterTWTR.Usually, the third product that was released today has a spotlight for itself in Apple's events, but the market proved otherwise.The tech company updated its most popular-sized iPad with a brighter 9.7-inch display, faster processors, stronger battery performance and a $70 slash in price. Instead of the typical exciting products announcement, Apple introduced their latest iPad with apress release.It may sound like a surprise to many, but the company's latest quarterly report showed that iPad sales had dropped for 12 straight quarters, according toCNET.Despite the declining sales, Apple still leads in the tablet market, though it is a shrinking market. According toInternational Data Corporation, global shipment for tablets dropped 14.7% year-over-year to 43 million shipped in the third quarter 2016.Apple's quiet announcement of the new iPad further proves the declining needs of tablets in the market. Initially, tablets were the replacement for desktops and laptops. Today, larger screen smartphones, phablets, and detachable laptops are replacing tablets. While Apple and Samsung Electronic Co.SSNLFare still dominating the market and coming out with new products, the tablet is losing its charm.Stock RecordIt wasn't the release of new products that raised Apple's stock today but the continued anticipation of the new iPhone that brought up the price. With a series of positive analysts reports this week, Bernstein Research analyst Toni Sacconganhi raised Apple's price target to $160 from $140.Sacconganhi isn't the only analyst that raised the price target. Timothy Arcuri from Cowen & Co.COWNalso raised his price target to $155 from $135. Investors are betting on the new features of iPhone 8 to attract sales. Zacks sees seven positive estimate revisions for the current year in the last 60 days and six negative revisions.After opening at an all-time high, Apple closed the day at $139.84 per share with a 1.15% drop.Apple holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric   Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

Tech Roundup: Intel Buys Mobileye, Pandora Launches Premium;3/21/2017;"The top news from last week was IntelINTCbuying Mobileye for $15 billion, but Pandora'sPPremium tier, Nintendo's success with the Switch and other news also made headlines.Here are the top stories from last week:Intel Buys MobileyeIntel paid $15 billion for Mobileye that some analysts thought was a huge price tag, especially since it generates revenue of around $350 million only and Intel was anyway already in collaboration with the autonomous technology provider. But given its strong relationships with automakers and design win pipeline, the possibility for deeper collaboration, lower cost of development and other cost synergies as a result of the acquisition, it may be just what Intel needed to battle the rapidly growing competition.Also, Mobileye's maps and data are of strategic value, not only because they are important building blocks of self-driving technology, but also because they will increase the value of Intel's solutions.Pandora Launches On-Demand Music ServicePandora has launched its long-awaited on-demand music streaming service called Pandora Premium for $9.99 a month, similar to other services like Spotify and Apple Music.The company's has a tiered service, starting with Pandora, an ad-supported free radio service that allows you to create ""stations"" based on your preferred artists, songs on genres with Pandora curating the playlist. This is followed by the $5 a month Pandora Plus, which is ad-free, but has limited freedoms in the form of track replay, offline listening (3 most-played stations), etc.Pandora Premium offers all this plus the ability to search and play songs on-demand, no timeouts, fully customizable playlists and more offline listening options. What's more, it comes with an Rdio-like streaming interface that was popular with customers until that company was acquired by Pandora.Pandora has 20 million customers, significantly higher than both Spotify and Apple Music, but while those services are growing strongly, Pandora isn't doing as well, resulting in growing losses year upon year. The just-launched Premium service may not be a runaway success because those looking for such a service have most likely shifted to one of the other services. So if Pandora is to get back in the game, it has to differentiate, or find a way to lure new users the way Apple did. Human curation and artificial intelligence to improve discovery could do the trick, so Pandora is going that route. But will it succeed? We'll have to wait and see.Nintendo's Switch Is on a RollAt launch, Nintendo expected to sell 2 million units of its new Switch game console in the first month. IDC analyst Lewis Ward estimated 8 million units in the first year. But fresh reports from the WSJ, which talked to people with knowledge of the matter, say that in its new fiscal year starting in April, its assemblers are planning to manufacture 16 million more units.The strength in demand across Europe (in a seasonally weak period), the Americas and Japan stems from record sales ofThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wildand the new features.The WSJ says that this likely means that the company will sell around 10 million units, arousing the interest of game developers to produce more games for the device. Nintendo officials have also said that the console may in the future stream content from Netflix, Hulu, Amazon and the like although gaming is the focal point for now. This is really good news for the console maker, which had a failed product in the Wii U (the earlier generation console that launched in 2012).The $300 Switch manages a tabletop mode while also doubling as a portable handheld (for around six hours at a time anyway) and including a docking station for using the TV screen. The table top version allows you to detach the Joy Con controllers so two can play a game. The goal for the Kyoto-based company is to reach the largest number of gamers whether they are serious, casual or just starting out. In this respect, it may be slightly limited because it supports fewer games than the competing XB1 and PS4 although it's still a larger spread than the Wii U.JP Morgan analyst Haruka More says: ""We expect acceleration in its sales momentum toward end-2017 driven bySplatoon 2, scheduled launching this summer.""Other storiesCorporateApple R&D Centers in China: In addition to Beijing and Shenzhen, AppleAAPLhas said that it will now open two more R&D centers in Shanghai and Suzhou, in line with its China R&D investment target of 3.5 billion yuan ($507.1 million). Apple is on slippery ground in China as the battle with local players is full on and the U.S. government's China policies can increase its problems with the Chinese government.LinkedIn Founder Reid Hoffman Joins Microsoft Board: Co-founder, ex-CEO and ex-executive chairman of LinkedIn Reid Hoffman is joining Microsoft's (MSFT) board three months after its acquisition by the Windows maker. His role in the position, as defined by Hoffman himself is: ""continue to focus on helping LinkedIn fulfill its mission of increasing the economic productivity of individual professionals and the companies they work for… I'll also contribute more broadly as Microsoft deepens its presence in Silicon Valley and continues to weave social, AI, and other technologies into [its] products.""Google-Facebook Data Highway: The highest-capacity internet link between Asia and the U.S. is about to be constructed by Chinese real estate magnate Wei Junkang's Pacific Light Data Communication Co (60% share), FacebookFB(20%) and Google (20%). American contractor TE SubCom will lay the 17-millimeter wide, 12,800-kilometer-long cable, which will in all probability be operational by late 2018.Legal/RegulatoryGoogle, Facebook Battle Hate Speech in Europe: In AlphabetGOOGL-owned Google's case, the problem was in the UK, where government ads didn't appear in a desired way. According to the government, ""Google is responsible for ensuring the high standards applied to government advertising are adhered to and that adverts do not appear alongside inappropriate content… We have placed a temporary restriction on our YouTube advertising pending reassurances from Google that government messages can be delivered in a safe and appropriate way.""In Germany, the government praised Google's YouTube for deleting 90% of flagged illegal content, while pulling up social networks like Facebook because ""Too little illegal content is deleted, it's not deleted quickly enough and it looks like the operators of social networks aren't taking their users seriously enough."" Under the draft proposal of new legislation being framed, the government promised fines of up to 50 million euros ($53 million) for failing to give users the option to complain about hate speech and fake news or refusing to remove illegal contentPakistan Wants Tech Help on Blasphemy: Pakistan wants to crack down on Pakistanis living in Pakistan or abroad who have shared material deemed blasphemous against Islam or the Prophet Muhammad. Facebook has said, ""We disclose information about accounts solely in accordance with our terms of service and applicable law. A Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty or other formal request may be required for international requests, and we include these in our Government Requests Report."" Twitter has yet to respond.Tech Companies Support Google's Fight with FBI: Apple, Cisco, Amazon and Microsoft filed a friend-of-the-court brief supporting Google in a case where it is seeking to overturn the order of a lower court to turn over to the FBI certain data stored on servers in other countries. They said, ""So bold a projection of U.S. law enforcement power into foreign countries would show disdain for their sovereignty and threaten to disrupt the harmony existing between the United States and other nations."" There is a precedent in this case: Microsoft won a similar case against the FBI, which wanted to see emails of a foreign national stored on an Irish server.Alphabet Adds to Case Against Uber: Alphabet's Waymo just added a fourth patent that it says was infringed upon by Uber and furnished further details including the statement of an eye-witness in a new filing on Friday. The statement is from Pierre-Yves Droz, a former colleague and close confidant of Levandowski's (the ex-Googler who has allegedly run off with Waymo self-driving technology and trade secrets to form self-driving trucking company Otto, which was subsequently bought by Uber for $680 million).The lawsuit specifies the time at which Levandowski met Uber executives in Jan 2016, registering the company that would become Otto the following day. Waymo is now seeking an injunction to prevent Uber from using the technology in its self-driving vehicles and seeking damages for any proven infringements.New Technology/ProductsMicrosoft Teams: Since its official preview in November last year, Microsoft has added more than 100 new features to the group communication and collaboration service, including things like scheduling capabilities; mobile audio calling, with video calling on Android now and coming soon to iOS and Windows Phone; email integration; and new security and compliance capabilities.Last week, the company rolled out Teams as part of Office 365 across 181 markets and in 19 languages. It's also said that more than 50K organizations have started using Microsoft Teams, including Alaska Airlines, Cerner Corporation, ConocoPhillips, Deloitte, Expedia, J.B. Hunt, J. Walter Thompson, Hendrick Motorsports, Sage, Trek Bicycle and Three UK.Google Voice Ads Test: ""By the way, Disney's live action Beauty and the Beast opens today,"" the Google Home smart speaker told people after giving them the time, weather and travel update as part of its ""My Day"" feature. Google said it wasn't an ad but speculation is running rife as everyone tries to figure out Google's monetization strategy for Home. ""We're continuing to experiment with new ways to surface unique content for users and we could have done better in this case,"" Google said by way of explanation.Google Tries ""Offensive"": Similar to Facebook's ""disputed"" tag, Google has decided to create groups called review teams to flag content they deem ""upsetting-offensive."" Some of the criteria Google's using to flag content would make you smile: ""high-quality"" pages could be the home page of a newspaper that has ""won seven Pulitzer Prize awards,"" and ""low-quality"" pages could be articles that include ""many grammar and punctuation errors."" Thankfully, the results will still show up, but with the flag.Google Payments Through Gmail: Google is extending the peer-to-peer payments service for Gmail users to the Gmail app for Android. Clicking on the attachments tab will now also throw up options to send or receive money with the funds then being transferred from one bank account to the other. The service will be directly pitted against PayPal's Venmo (although without its social aspect) and SquareCash.M&A and CollaborationsSky, Cisco Combine for OnPrime TV: The two have developed a new innovative app-based streaming service called OnPrime TV that will allow consumers in the UK, Italy and Germany to access popular foreign language film, television and news channels in one place. The app can be downloaded via the app store on Apple TV4 and is coming to other devices and other European countries soon. All channel packs offer a 30-day free trial, and range in price from £8.99 to £17.99 a month.Alibaba-Govt of Denmark: Alibaba GroupBABAExecutive Vice-Chairman Joseph Tsai and Danish Minister of Foreign Affairs Anders Samuelsen witnessed the signing of a memorandum of understanding (MoU) that will increase exports from Denmark to China and see the Chinese company promote Denmark as a tourist destination for Chinese travelers. Alibaba's reach (440 million annual active buyers) makes it an attractive platform for foreign advertisers and sellers even through it isn't perfect in terms of curbing counterfeits.Alibaba's Tmall Global has developed country pavilions to familiarize Chinese customers with a true essence of the country in question and help them identify authenticity. The Danish pavilion will have more than 20 brands selling high-quality Danish products in the fashion, lifestyle, home and food categories for starters.Twitter Inks Deal with National Lacrosse League: Twitter has signed a two-year deal that will see it broadcast one game a week with the National Lacrosse League (NLL). Twitter will also live stream the NLL's playoffs and show highlights. The games will also be aired on NLL's video subscription service called NLLTV.com. This isn't of course in the same league as the NFL, NHL, professional boxing and eSports that Twitter dealt with earlier, but it's evidence that the deals continue to trickle in. But the NLL doesn't have a broadcast TV partner, so this is a big deal from its perspective.NVIDIA Self-Driving Partnerships: At the ConnectedWorld event in Berlin, Germany, NVIDIA announced a couple of autonomous driving partnerships with the world's largest auto parts supplier Bosch and popular trucking company PACCAR. The companies will be using NVIDIA's artificial intelligence-powered Drive PX AI technology to develop self-driving cars and trucks.Google-Levi's: Google's Project Jaquard, which combines thin, metallic alloys with natural and synthetic yarns to create touch-sensitive interactive fabrics is finally inside smart jackets from Levi's. The jackets, which will allow you to skip songs, use Google maps and make phone calls by the brush of your sleeve, will sell for $350 from this fall.Some NumbersAmazon Cash Rewards: Alexa has been steadily adding ""skills"" or apps that make it more useful for developers and from last week, owners can ask it to deliver one of the three recently-ordered meals from GrubHub. They just have to say something like, ""Alexa, tell GrubHub I'm hungry"", to which Alexa will respond with the options to choose from. Also from last week, Alexa can get iRobot's Roomba robot to start cleaning your house and give you detailed reports about the job done, time taken etc.So to add to the fun, Amazon decided to make it easier for developers to do more with Alexa by giving them cash rewards. They get a $100 AWS promotional credit and an additional $100 per month in AWS credits if they incur usage charges for their skill. So Amazon basically takes care of app development and hosting until they've made enough themselves to be happy.Google, Facebook Lead in Digital Ads: According to eMarketer's latest forecast, U.S. digital ad spending will increase 16% this year to $83 billion with Google and Facebook claiming the largest share by virtue of their strength in search and display, respectively. Google's overall share of digital ad spending will be 40.7% this year while Facebook's will be over 19%.Facebook is expected to continue growing much faster than Google off a smaller base. Google will dominate in search with a 78% share and Facebook in display with a 39% share. Twitter, which derives 89% of its total ad revenue from mobile, will for the first time see mobile ad revenue shrink, by 5%. Snapchat, which commands just 1.2% of the total U.S. mobile ad market, and just 4% of the total growth in U.S. digital advertising, will grow its ad revenue by 158% to $770 million.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric   Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

1 Great Tech Stock for Wary Retirees;3/21/2017;"Many retirees shy away from tech companies -- to their own   detriment. Maybe it's due to fear of a sector that, as a whole,   is often considered to be higher risk than other, less dynamic   industries. But there are a select few companies that, thanks to   their dominant competitive advantages, offer an excellent   low-risk way for investors to profit from emerging technologies.   Read on to learn about one of the best.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();All hail the kingFew businesses are as dominant within their respective   industries asAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) . The parent company of Google   gives investors an opportunity beyond a core Internet search   business that legendary investor Charlie Munger once described as   havingthe largest competitive moathe's ever seen.With a more than 90% share of the global search engine market,   Google is the undisputed king of search. Yet it refuses to grow   complacent; it's constantly expanding its reach with an   ever-growing array of services. It now possesses an incredible   collection of platforms that serve more than 1billionusers each, including YouTube, Android, Chrome, Gmail, Maps,   Google Play, and nowGoogle Cloud. Together, they serve to expand and strengthen Google's powerful   ecosystem and widen its competitive moat.Moreover, Google generates enormous amounts of cash, to the   tune of nearly $26 billion in 2016, which it has used to build a   fortress-like balance sheet with more than $86 billion in cash   and less than $4 billion in debt. This financial strength allows   it to invest aggressively in research and development, and in the   acquisition of companies that are leading the way in important   new technologies. All of this, combined with Google's renowned   culture of innovation, helps it remain at the forefront of   technological change.Image source: Getty Images.Other betsIt's this innovation that necessitated its reorganization into   its current ""Alphabet"" structure. The design is brilliant, as it sends a clear message   about what the company has become: a collection of businesses   with investments in a far-ranging array of exciting technologies   that are poised to pay increasing returns to shareholders in the   years ahead.Alphabet's holding company structure allows disparate   businesses -- such as self-driving technology leaderWaymo, life sciences companyVerily, and connected home device makerNest-- to be run and scaled independently. Management believes this   will give these ""other bets"" their best chance at receiving the   resources and attention they need to succeed over the long   term.Alphabet therefore gives investors many ways to win. The   company's core Google business is as dominant as they come, which   helps to lower Alphabet's overall risk profile. And the company's   other bets have in many ways become analogous to an emerging   technology fund overseen by two of the greatest minds on the   planet: co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin. It's the perfect   balance of market dominance and optionality; cash flow and   reinvestment opportunity; current success and future growth   potential.ValuationAt first glance, Alphabet's forward price-to-earnings ratio in   the low 20's may seem a bit expensive compared to the   S&P 500's forward P/E of about 18. But if you adjust for the   more than $82 billion in net cash it has on its balance sheet --   which equates to about $119 per share -- Alphabet's ex-cash P/E   drops to less than 19. On that basis, Alphabet's stock is quite a   bargain, especially considering its superior growth rates   compared to the market as a whole.Moreover, investors who buy shares today will be buying   alongside Alphabet itself. The company has a $7 billion share   repurchase program currently under way -- a figure that's likely   tocontinue to growalong with Alphabet's ever rising cash flows. These share   buybacks should further help to support Alphabet's stock price,   and they signal management's increasing willingness to return   capital to shareholders.All told, Alphabet offers retirees an excellent and relatively   low-risk way to profit from emerging technologies -- a high   potential field that's often underrepresented in retirement   portfolios.10 stocks we like better than Alphabet (A     shares)When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run     for over a decade,Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has tripled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy right now... and Alphabet (A shares)     wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks     are even better buys.Click hereto learn about these picks!*Stock Advisor returns as of February 6, 2017Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The     Motley Fool's board of directors.Joe Tenebrusohas no position in any stocks mentioned.

Movado Group, Inc.'s Earnings Sink as Retailers Struggle;3/21/2017;"Movado Group(NYSE: MOV) reported fiscal 2017 fourth-quarter earnings on March   20. In the face of falling sales and profits, the luxury   watchmaker is attempting to adapt its business to the rapid   growth of e-commerce.Movado Group results: The raw numbersMetricQ4 2017makeArticleAd();Q4 2016Year-Over-Year ChangeSales$130.785 million$143.264 million(8.7%)Net income$5.232 million$7.888 million(33.7%)Earnings per share$0.22$0.34(35.3%)Data source: Movado Group Q4 2017 earningspress release.Image source: Movado.What happened with Movado Group this quarter?Net sales fell 8.7% year over year to $130.8 million, and   7.5% on a constant dollar basis, as Movado continues to be   negatively impacted by the struggles of department stores and   other traditional retailers. ""We are seeing a significant   shift from brick and mortar to e-commerce and a continuing   challenged fashion watch market in the United States,"" said   Chairman and CEO Efraim Grinberg in a press release.Gross profit declined 14% to $64.7 million, with gross margin   falling to 49.5% compared to 52.6% in the fourth quarter of   2016. Lower sales also dented operating income, which   dropped 36% to $7.4 million. All told, net income   tumbled 34% to $5.2 million, and earnings per share   decreased 35% to $0.22.Looking forwardIn response to this challenging retail environment, Movado is   implementing multiple cost-saving initiatives and devoting more   resources to its e-commerce business. ""Given the evolution   of the retail market place, we are consolidating certain   operations and shifting a greater portion of our investment into   the continued development and growth of our digital footprint,   including allocating a larger percentage of our marketing budget   to online venues,"" said Grinberg.""We are fully committed in our investments in digital and are   very pleased with the multiple initiatives underway,"" added   President Ricardo Quintero during a conference call with   analysts. ""Movado.com was our fastest-growing business unit with   double-digit increases and our digital advertising and social   media footprint continues to grow and gain traction.""To further adapt to changing consumer preferences, Movado is   also expanding its lineup of smartwatches by partnering withAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) subsidiary Google. ""While we   believe in the continued growth potential of the traditional   watch category, we are also excited about our recently announced   partnership with Google to launch a new smartwatch   collection, Movado Connect,"" Grinberg said.Still, Movado is reducing its workforce in an attempt to cut   operating costs by $12 million in fiscal 2018 and $15   million annually thereafter.

Why the Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock Comeback Is Just Beginning;3/21/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) has gotten some of its moxie back. Granted, the growth is nowhere near the pace of the glory years of the 1980s and 1990s. But then again, the shareholder returns have been impressive. During the last 5 years, Microsoft stock has logged a gain of nearly 100%. By comparison,International Business Machines Corp.(NYSE:IBM) has a loss of 13% andQualcomm, Inc.(NASDAQ:QCOM) lost about 11%.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockBut it does seem like the opportunity may be mostly gone for Microsoft stock. Let's face it, the valuation is far from cheap.Consider that the price-to-earnings ratio is about 30X and MSFT stock is near an all-time high. Yet, I think there remains more upside. The fact is that Microsoft stock is a great way to play the cloud megatrend, which is likely to see growth for many years.Why MSFT Stock Is a Good BetThis technology has many benefits that are just too critical to ignore, such as the ability for real-time analytics, better integration with other systems and seamless updates. The business model is also fairly predictable, since it is based on ongoing subscriptions.According toAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Cloud Chief Diane Greene, only about5% of the world's data is in the cloud. She thinks that ultimately the market could hit a stunning $1 trillion.7 Small-Cap Tech Stocks on the Cutting EdgeBut there is another important driver: In today's world, just about all companies need a strong digital presence to be successful. Simply put, customers have come to expect that they should go to a site or app - and quickly get what they want.So to provide this service, companies will need to rely on cloud services. And for now, the two main players include MSFT andAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN).But Microsoft stock may be in the best position. The company has a trusted global brand, a massive global infrastructure, a network of millions of developers as well as thousands of partners and a wide assortment of enterprise software products. Oh, and there is a massive customer base that uses productivity apps like Office.Such advantages are extremely tough to replicate.Bottom Line on Microsoft StockBut what's also important for MSFT stock is that the company has essentially gone all-in with its cloud efforts, such as integrating features among its products and engaging in aggressive M&A.For example, the company has acquired MileIQ, Xamarin and SwiftKey to bolster its mobile footprint. And more recently, MSFT has been acquiring companies in the Artificial Intelligence space. Some examples include Genee (AI-powered scheduling) and Maluuba (natural language processing).Chesapeake Energy Corporation (CHK) Stock Is an Absolute Steal Right NowYet the $27 billion purchase for LinkedIn will perhaps be the most significant for Microsoft stock. With the deal, MSFT gets the global leader in professional online networks - there are over467 million members- that should allow for powerful synergies with existing assets. Already, the company has added LinkedIn services with the Dynamics CRM platform.So yes, it should be no surprise that the quarterly reports from MSFT reflect lots of momentum. In the latestquarter, the company's Azure service, which is similar to Amazon Web Services, saw revenues spike by 93%. In fact, the annual run-rate for the total cloud segment is at over $14 billion.It's true that the cloud market is getting increasingly competitive, as seen with the efforts of companies like IBM,Oracle Corporation(NYSE:ORCL) andHewlett Packard Enterprise Co(NYSE:HPE), but they are all really playing catchup and they do not have the breadth of services that MSFT has. In other words, when it comes to playing the cloud, Microsoft stock remains a great option for investors.Tom Taulli runs the InvestorPlace blogIPO Playbookand is the author of various books, includingTaxes 2017: Saving A Bundle.Follow him on Twitter at@ttaulli.

IBM's Prospects Bright on Watson's Increasing Popularity;3/21/2017;"International Business Machines Corporation'sIBMcognitive solution platform, IBM Watson, seems to be on a roll. Recently, the company's artificial intelligence (AI) platform has been adopted by the likes of AT&T Inc.T, Harry & David, Charlotte Russe and Performance Bicycle.Notably, AT&T will integrate its own Internet of Things (IoT) solutions with IBM Watson on the cloud to provide its enterprise customers enhanced analytic insights into industrial IoT data.Also, Harry & David - the leading supplier of gourmet food products and premium class, gift quality fruits - adopted the full suite of Watson Customer Engagement solutions on the IBM Cloud. This should enable the company to let customers zero-in on the perfect gift at the right time.Similarly, Charlotte Russe, a U.S.-based women's clothing retailer adopted Watson Customer Engagement solutions on IBM Cloud to streamline its order fulfillment process, boost profitability as well as ascertain customer satisfaction.These apart, Performance Bicycle and Titan Company Limited, a leading manufacturer of watches and other personal accessories in India adopted the Watson Customer Engagement solutions on the IBM Cloud.Cognitive Solutions Driving Top-line GrowthWe note that, IBM has been moving away from its traditional businesses to newer (read lucrative) business avenues like cloud and data analytics. During the last reported quarter, Cognitive Solutions (solutions software and transaction processing software) revenues grew 1.4% (up 2.2% at constant currency) year over year to $5.30 billion.International Business Machines Corporation Revenue     (TTM)International Business Machines Corporation   Revenue (TTM)|International Business Machines Corporation QuoteIn 2016, IBM's strategic imperatives (cloud, analytics, mobility and security) revenues increased 13% (up 14% at constant currency) year over year. Cloud revenues surged 35% year over year to $13.7 billion.We also note that IBM continues to expand Watson product offerings. During the last quarter, the company introduced new applications like the Watson Data Platform, Watson Discovery Service and trade surveillance for Financial Services. Further, the company added new cognitive capabilities for conversation to Watson.Per the recent IBM Investor Briefing 2017, IBM estimates the market for IBM Watson on Cloud as a decision making support system to be worth nearly $2 trillion by 2025.What Does this Mean for IBM?Per an IDC report, worldwide spending on cognitive systems and artificial intelligence is expected to be over $47 billion by 2020, which is currently growing at a CAGR of 55.1%.Given the huge opportunity the sector has to offer, the company faces stiff competition from major players like MicrosoftMSFT, AlphabetGOOGLand Apple.However, we believe that IBM is well positioned to brave the headwinds due to the ongoing adoption trend for Watson cloud. We believe that the increasing popularity of Watson cloud bodes well for the company in the long run.We note that the growing adoption trend of the Watson platform has helped IBM outperform the S&P 500 in the last one year. While the stock has gained 18.2%, the S&P 500 Index has registered an increased 15.3% in the same period.Zacks RankAt present, IBM carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Google Pixel 2 Revealed in Leak, Game Changer for Alphabet?;3/21/2017;"If rumors are to be believed, Alphabet Inc.'sGOOGLGoogle is already working on Google Pixel 2, its next smartphone offering. The buzz is that the new phone will sport a slimmer body, powerful camera and hardware, and stay ""premium"".Google Pixel was released last October, and has gone on to become one of the most popular and exciting smartphones. The phone is a big hit among media and consumers.Google Pixel comes at a premium price and targets high-end consumers. This puts Google in direct competition with AppleAAPLand Samsung's high end offerings.The flagship fight is already intense among Google Pixel, Samsung Galaxy S7 and iPhone 7. With speculation already building around Galaxy S8 and iPhone 8, it will not come as a surprise if Google rolls out the next generation of its pixel phone.Alphabet's shares appreciated 6.4% over the last six months, from the time Google Pixel was released, compared with the ZacksInternet-Servicesindustry's gain of 3.6%. It would be interesting to see how the new device (if launched) influences share price.Leaks Reveal Notable Design ChangesMultiple sources have revealed that Google is working on Pixel 2, reportedly codenamed ""taimen"". Considering what taimen literally means (a fish weighing over 100 kilogram) and Google's habit of indicating device size through codenames, we can expect a massive phone with at least 6 inches display.Renders surfacing online suggest notable differences between Pixel 2 and its predecessor. It seems that the new phone will feature narrower bezels both on top and bottom, two speaker grilles, indicating a possible inclusion of stereo speakers, separate volume buttons instead of a rocker, a redesigned glass back with chamfered edges, fingerprint sensor and center-aligned camera module.The position of USB Type-C port at the base and 3.5 mm audio jack at the top remains unchanged.Game Changer for Alphabet?First, we have to wait till Google I/O in May and see if there is actually a new Pixel phone in the company's pipeline.In case, the rumors are found to be true, we don't believe that the device will be anything like a game changer for Google.To make the phone as fascinating as a game changer, the company will have to outsmart Apple and Samsung on both the software and hardware fronts at a competitive price, and that's really hard to achieve. However, we expect the device to give tough competition to similar offerings from rivals.Alphabet Inc. PS Ratio (TTM)Alphabet Inc. PS Ratio (TTM)|Alphabet Inc. QuoteNotably, the major challenge that hovered around Google Pixel was its high price. Several reports have suggested that Pixel 2 will have a pocket-friendly companion to help the company broaden its customer base and boost sales. The rumored Pixel 2B will be priced lesser than the main device, sacrificing on some hardware power.We also note that the initial Pixel device has a high performance 12.3 megapixel camera, but it lags the likes of Samsung Galaxy S7 in terms of pure megapixels. It has been rumored that Google with replace this camera in the new device with one that works extremely well in low light.Google is reportedly testing a number of processors, including the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon chips and specialized Intel hardware. So, we can expect the inclusion of a powerful processor as well as more memory and storage. Reports also claim the inclusion of waterproof design for the first time.Wrapping UpIt goes without saying that Google must do something to outsmart its rivals Samsung, Apple and SonySNEin the high range smartphone market. With an increasing focus on innovation, huge cash balance and technological prowess, Google has the flexibility to pursue growth in this area and give tight competition to the others.Currently, Alphabet has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A better-ranked stock is Autohome Inc.ATHM, sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Driverless Tech at South by Southwest 2017;3/21/2017;"South by Southwest (SXSW) is a giant conference where some of the biggest minds in tech gather to talk about their most exciting new ideas.In this clip from Motley Fool'sIndustry Focuspodcast, our Fools on the ground at this year's conference in Austin, Texas, share some of the most interesting presentations they've seen so far about self-driving cars and developments in the state of self-driving car technology -- including a city that already has a fleet of self-driving taxis running on the streets, howAlphabet's Google(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) might cash in on its self-driving project a few years (or decades) down the line, and more.makeArticleAd();A full transcript follows the video.10 stocks we like better than AlphabetWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade,Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has tripled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy right now... and Alphabet wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.Click hereto learn about these picks!*Stock Advisor returns as of February 6, 2017This podcast was recorded on March 16, 2017.Sean O'Reilly:So, while you're down there at South by Southwest, what did you learn about this possible use of the future?Simon Erickson:It's, I think, the natural next step that we're going to have self-driving fleets instead of just self-driving cars. If you're driving to work and leaving your car in a parking garage all day, you're really not getting the benefits of it being able to navigate and drive itself. They're really meant to be used to be driving all day long. And when you do that, you get a higher utilization out of the vehicle, and that really brings the cost of them down. And you have powerful things behind the scenes. You have neural networks, and all the chips that aren't really cheap. This is really the way that these are meant to be used, to be in fleets. Uber andHertzand all the large fleets and self-driving taxis are really aiming to do this. As far as South by Southwest, you were asking some of the things we learned, we found out that about half the world's population is in cities today, and that's going to grow to about two-thirds by 2050. So, we're going to be moving from about 3.5 billion people in cities today to 7 billion within the next 30 years or so. And you can't just keep building out more and more suburbs and highways and parking garages as infrastructure to have this many people moving into the cities. It needs to be a better-designed city. And I think we're going to see self-driving cars play a key role in how cities are actually designing themselves to accommodate for the population boom.O'Reilly:Yeah, I remember another Fool, Armun Asgari, he had that piece back in October,The Race to Autonomy: An Investor's Guide to Self-Driving Cars. It's a bit of a read, but it was awesome. And one of the things that it's common sense that he points out is, the average American family owns 2.2 cars, and it's a $30,000-$50,000 asset that is rapidly depreciating. Wouldn't it be nice to get some use out of that? Wouldn't it be nice if our cities weren't just these monoliths of concrete to park these things that aren't being used 95% of the time? Did you see anything hard or tangible down at the conference there, on this trend?Erickson:There were sessions. It was more academic, as far as what we had seen at South by Southwest. In terms of use cases, though, I think Singapore is one that we can keep an eye on, if you want to see this in action right now. Singapore, of course, is a city that likes to monitor everything. There's no littering there. They're really cracking down on only smoking in certain areas. It's a very oversight city, so, they're really ahead of the curve on monitoring things. Even today, Sean, they have their analog for Uber. It's a company called Grab, who's teamed up with another company called NuTonomy that's already got self-driving cars navigating around the city, picking people up, basically a taxi service that is happening right now. There is an engineer in the passenger seat just for the peace of mind for the riders. But they're planning to have 100 driverless cars within the next year. This is something that's already happening out there -- you can actually get into a car that's navigating itself to the location for you.O'Reilly:Throughout Singapore, yeah. Can I ask what kind of car is it? I know that Uber was testing driverless cars in Pittsburgh, and I believe they were Volvo crossover SUVs or something. Do you know any of that stuff off the top of your head?Erickson:Yeah, it is Volvo for the U.S. for Uber for self-driving cars. There's also a company called Otto for self-driving trucks, which could be for transport.O'Reilly:Wow. I have to go to my local Volvo dealership and see if they have an engineer sitting around that can take me out on one of these things.Erickson:I have a crazy futuristic idea for you, also.O'Reilly:Is this better than the driverless luggage?Erickson:It is. And you knew, when you invited me on the show, being anExplorer, futuristic kind of guy, that I was going to have to throw some ideas like this to you, right?O'Reilly:I'm all ears.Erickson:The economics are such that the average taxi fare, in the U.S., is charging about $3.50 a mile. Pretty expensive. And it's generally accepted that by 2021, when we're expecting autonomous vehicles to really start going mainstream, that the cost of an autonomous car will cost in the neighborhood of $0.30 a mile. Less than a tenth of the cost today. Now, when you get to that kind of price point, Sean, that opens up a lot of options of who is actually paying $0.30 a mile per trip for customers. And the idea would be, this can be subsidized by advertising companies like Google, where you can get into an autonomous car. Yeah. Get in for a free ride. It'll bring you within a 10-mile radius, or whatever the distance would be. It'll cost Google maybe $3 for your trip, at $0.30 a mile. But in exchange, they have your undivided attention that they can serve you ads in the car.O'Reilly:Oh, my gosh. I mean, I would obviously just look at my phone or read a book. But that's awesome.Erickson:Yeah, especially when you consider the numbers that you threw out earlier. The average American is spending a third of their household income every year on these rapidly depreciating assets that we call cars. It doesn't have to be that way when you start getting into the discussion of $0.30 a mile.Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.Simon Ericksonhas no position in any stocks mentioned.Sean O'Reillyhas no position in any stocks mentioned.

New Details Emerge on Apple's Augmented Reality Ambitions;3/20/2017;"We already know thatApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is extremely interested in augmented reality (AR)   thanks to astring of commentsmade by CEO Tim Cook over the past year or so. Given Cook's   statements, it should be obvious that the company is working onsomethingin AR; what's less clear is how Apple plans to create and deliver   AR experiences. Will it be a function of future iPhones? Perhaps   a new hardware product designed specifically for AR? Probably   both.Bloomberg's Mark Gurmannow has new details on the Mac maker's AR ambitions.Tim Cook hopes augmented reality will be Apple's next big     thing. Image source: Apple.makeArticleAd();With our powers combinedUnsurprisingly, Apple has already assembled a team of   experienced hardware and software engineers, while also tapping   ""talented outsiders,"" according to the report. The team includes   engineers who have worked onFacebook's(NASDAQ: FB) Oculus Rift andMicrosoft's HoloLens. Some special effects artists from the movie industry   are supposedly even in the mix. The company has also made a   handful of AR-related acquisitions to accelerate its efforts,   such as the 2015 purchase of AR start-up Metaio or the 2016   acquisition of spatial perception start-up Flyby, among   others.Gurman believes that Apple AR glasses will launch after Apple   attempts to include AR functions into future iPhones. The   challenge will be keeping the form factor thin and light while   being able to deliver compelling experiences. For this reason, AR   glasses may be tethered to the iPhone, which has more processing   power and can transmit data to AR glasses wirelessly. Keeping   costs down will also be important, since the inevitable price   point needs to be justifiable to mainstream consumers.Mike Rockwell, a former executive atDolby, is reportedly in charge of the team. Rockwell reports to   hardware engineering chief Dan Riccio. The report also details   many other members of the team, and a diverse range of   experiences and skill sets that will contribute to Apple's AR   vision.This all comes shortly after IDC recentlypredictedthat while virtual reality (VR) may be the early winner in the   AR/VR race, AR very likely has greater revenue opportunities over   the long term.In other AR newsFacebook may be prioritizing VR with Oculus, but a report   yesterday fromBusiness Insiderdetails some of the social network's other hardware projects   within its Building 8 division. Facebook has been ramping its   hardware efforts, and has no less than four projects that it is   currently pursuing, notably including one that involves cameras   and AR. The company is betting big that the next big computing   revolution will come in the form of VR and/or AR, and being   relatively new on the tech behemoth scene, it is determined to   help shape the technology.Once upon a time,Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) was the poster child for AR with   Google Glass. While Google Glass flopped on the consumer front,NPRreports that Google Glass is still very much in use in industrial   settings. Manufacturing companies are exploring ways to improve   productivity with Google Glass and AR, which allow workers to   access more information more easily while still being able to use   their hands. Workers previously used tablets, but wearable AR   technology delivers many of the same benefits.In the coming years, the AR front is going to get a whole lot   more exciting -- and crowded.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Twitter Bot Scandal Puts Further Pressure On CEO Jack Dorsey;3/20/2017;"Jack Dorsey, CEO of Twitter Inc.TWTR, is facing another problem in convincing advertisers to return to Twitter, as new research showed that up to 15% of Twitter's 319 million users can be bots rather than human.The research was conducted by University of Southern California and Indiana University. Researchers used more than 1,000 features to identify bot accounts on Twitter. It was estimated that between 9% and 15% of active Twitter accounts are bots.The estimate of 15% is almost twice of Twitter's own estimates. In Twitter's Q4 earnings, the company reported up to 8.5% of accounts could be bots.Twitter is hit particularly hard by this research because the company is already struggling to persuade advertisers to come back. Dorsey, one of the site's co-founders, came back in 2015 as chief executive and hopes to turn around the company's fortune; however, little progress has been made.The company is still far away from making its first profit and stale user growth.The loss from operation of fourth quarter was  $143 million, compared to $67 million during the same time last year. Twitter also reported just 4% growth to 319 million monthly active users year-over-year.The company's performance and the bot scandal puts further pressure on Dorsey to step down as Twitter's CEO.A Twitter spokesperson recognized that bot accounts often have negative connation but can be extremely beneficial, like those that automatically alert people of natural disasters or from customer service points of view.While the researchers agreed on the benefits of the bot accounts, they also pointed out, ""there is a growing record of malicious applications of social bots. Some emulate human behavior to manufacture fake grassroots political support… and promote terrorist propaganda and recruitment.""This is a problem that not only Twitter is having but all social media platforms, as Google'sGOOGLYouTube is currently suffering from ads placement issues with its advertisers.Twitter closed the day at $15.09 per share, up 0.07%.Zacks' 2017 IPO Watch ListBefore looking into the stocks mentioned above, you may want to get a head start on potential tech IPOs that are popping up on Zacks' radar.

Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Finds Growth in AI and Mobile;3/20/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsYou would think that irrelevant ads on mobile devices and desktops would go away, yetAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) defies that belief. The search engine giant is as relevant as ever, and its targeted advertising model is a favorite for advertisers and marketing teams.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockNear a yearly high and at a price-to-earnings ratio of around 31 times, the company faces no headwinds. Competition fromFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) is hardly a concern, even after GOOGL's weak Google+ offering.Alphabet's Electronic Money BusinessGoogle's Gmail for the web now allows for sending money from within the Android app. This could threatenPayPal Holdings Inc(NASDAQ:PYPL).For now, though, PayPal need not worry. Google users may not even know about this money-transferring features. PayPal's branding is so solid that it, along with investors, should not expect an erosion in its business. So, Google Wallet, and evenApple Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AAPL) Apple Pay, have too little of the market share in electronic payments at this time.Still, GOOGL's foray in this business is a necessity. It cannot rely entirely on advertising for all of its revenue.7 Dividend Stocks With Yields That Grow Like WeedsDespite Google and Facebook dominating the digital advertising space, Google's reliance on ad clicks is a clear risk. In the fourth quarter, the company faced higher hardware costs, as itinvestedin the new Pixel phone, Daydream View Virtual Reality and Google Home.But the good news is that Google's revenue growth of 22% year-over-year to $26.06 billion allows the company to invest. Investors are hardly worried: the stock bottomed at the $800 per share range on Feb. 1 and has surged over $860 a share.Increasing ad content to grow profit margins brings risks for GOOGL shareholders. Google's search results will worsen if it continues pushing too many paid ads or its own services before it connects the user to the proper search results. Just do a search for a ""car,"" The search results display at least five ads before the useful results show up below them. On the desktop, this is not entirely unusable because the user gets the results on one screen. On mobile, the ads add to scrolling time for the user. The more frustrating the user experience, the more likely users will start abandoning Google.com in favor ofMicrosoft Corporation's(NASDAQ:MSFT) Bing or DuckDuckGo.Growth in MobileGoogle's focus on high-end hardware, notably the Google Pixel phone, ensures the company is at the forefront of mobile. Google Assistant is the key software solution in the hardware. And it lets GOOGL stock continue its development in AI solutions. Microsoft's Cortana and Apple's Siri are the competitors to the Assistant.Pixel is still in the early phases of hardware development. Since Google puts an emphasis on the user experience, future iterations will only offer a better experience. So this will result in users spending more time using Assistant, Google Search, and other Google apps:""In terms of Google Assistant on the Pixel along with how search works, I think definitely it gives us a way to iterate and move faster and make sure it's working better for users.

Google's Rating Cut Over YouTube Ad Placements;3/20/2017;"Alphabet Inc.GOOGL, the parent company of Google, received a downgrade today to ""Hold"" from ""Buy"" by Pivotal Research analyst Brian Wieser. The reason for the rating cut centered on the placement of YouTube's ads. Some ad buyers had voiced that their ads appeared next to videos carrying homophobic or terroristic videos on YouTube.This has become a large problem for Google in the UK, as many of the largest brands have suspended their advertising on YouTube. Agency holding company HavasHAVSFannounced that it has suspended all advertising on YouTube and Google Display Network for its clients in the U.K. Havas' clients includes the UK Government, L'OrealLRLCY,McDonald'sMCD, and Sainsbury,JSAIY.""We think that the problems which have come to light will have global repercussions as marketers potentially adapt their U.K. policies to other markets and as marketers around the world become more aware of the problem,"" said Wieser in a report.Outside of the U.S., Britain is Google's largest market for advertising revenues. It generated almost 9% of Alphabet's total revenues in 2016.On Friday, Google said that it worked hard on making sure ads don't appear on pages or videos with hate speech, or gory or offensive content but with 400 hours of video uploaded to YouTube every minute, it is very hard to get everything correct.""We have always said Google, Facebook and others are media companies and have the same responsibilities as any other media company. They can't masquerade as technology companies, particularly when they place advertisements,"" said Martin Sorrell, the CEO of WPP Plc.WPPGY, the world's largest advertising firm.Google apologized on Monday for the incidents and made a commitment to simplify advertiser controls, add safer defaults and increase investments to enforce its ad policies faster.Alphabet closed the day with a decrease of $4.46 (0.51%) to $867.91 per share.Zacks' 2017 IPO Watch ListBefore looking into the stocks mentioned above, you may want to get a head start on potential tech IPOs that are popping up on Zacks' radar.

Is Google or Amazon Winning the Home Assistant Market?;3/20/2017;"Of all the recent technological trends, the rise of home assistant products is one of the most intriguing ones. These products are developed to control home devices like home security, lighting and sprinklers, to name a few. Home assistant products also make online shopping an easy task.As these products are fast becoming a part of our homes, the competition too is gradually heating up as to which products can emerge the best home assistants. So far, the two main competitors in this space are Amazon'sAMZNAmazon Echo and Google'sGOOGLGoogle Home.Let's see what Amazon and Google have been doing to maintain their supremacy in the Home Assistant device space and how these devices help the companies in increasing their sales.Amazon Echo DevicesAlways aiming for innovation, Amazon is definitely a frontrunner in the growing Home Assistant market.Not many people could have predicted the popularity of Amazon's Alexa when the product was first announced in 2014.It is a small speaker-like home automation device that can do everything from streaming music to dimming lights or cranking up the heat on the compatible thermostat through voice commands. It is capable of interacting with smart home products, such as the Philips Hue smart light bulbs and smart thermostats from Alphabet-owned Nest.Amazon has been continuously adding new features to its Echo devices. So the growing list of things its devices can do has been keeping Echo in the headlines. The list includes a formidable lineup of compatible smarthome devices that Echo can control.How Will These Echo Devices Increase Sales?It is important to understand the nature of Amazon's core business. It is primarily an online retailer that sells a wide array of products. So, these Echo products play right into Amazon's core retail business. These Amazon's Echo devices help a consumer in making online purchases through voice command, thus saving time and energy.  Also, Alexa can play music from Amazon's paid for subscription service and thereby act as a passive block on using rival shopping sites.These new products from Amazon have the potential to increase sales and garner higher revenues.Coming to the price performance, over the past one year, shares of Amazon outperformed the Zacks categorized Electronic Commerce industry. While the industry gained 53.88%, the stock returned 40.11%.Google's Efforts toward Fight CompetitionGoogle on the other hand, became the second entrant in the Home Assistant space with the launch of Google Home in October last year. Much like Echo, Google Home, also performs an array of tasks such as playing music, reading books, managing calendars, answering queries, searching places, calling over cabs, controlling smart home devices and so on. It runs on Google's new voice assistant.Though it is still unclear how Home will benefit Google, but it will surely help create some competition with Alexa. Moreover, as voice is being seen as the next big thing in computer interaction, these products could help Google expand its revenue going forward.Research company, Gartner, said that, 30% of all interactions with devices will be voice-based by 2018, because people can speak up to four times faster than they can type. Also, the technology behind voice interaction is continuously improving, thus increasing its use in future.However, if will it be accepted by the mass is yet to be seen.Coming to the price performance, over the past one year, shares of Alphabet have been steadily treading higher. The stock returned 14.45% compared with the Zacks categorizedInternet Servicesindustry's gain of 11.46%.Stupendous Growth Expected in This MarketPer the recent report from Gartner, consumer spending on virtual personal assistant-enabled wireless speakers will reach $2.1 billion worldwide in 2020, up from $360 million in 2015.Also, the research firm claimed that by the year 2020, 3.3% of global households are expected to adopt a VPA-enabled wireless speaker. Werner Goertz, an analyst at Gartner, said, ""The widespread adoption and proliferation of VPA speakers could result in a significant number of online shopping orders in the home being initiated from a VPA speaker, rather than a laptop or mobile device.""The strong growth projection for the personal assistant market is a key growth catalyst for Amazon and Google. It looks like these tech companies won't stop until they have full control over everyone's home.As a booming future is being predicted for the home assistant market, Amazon and Google's home assistant devices could quite well add to their top and bottom-line figures going forward.Bottom LineImportantly, the personal assistant space is still in its nascent stage. Therefore companies like Google and Amazon, among others are strong contenders in the new war of capturing consumers' homes.Although both the companies are making continuous efforts toward releasing and upgrading new products in this space, it will be interesting to see which way consumers lean and how sales affect both companies going forward.As technology continues to improve, home assistants could soon become even more commonplace.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, both Amazon and Alphabet carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector include ON Semiconductor CorporationONand Advanced Energy Industries, Inc.AEIS, each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks   here.For the current year, estimates for ON Semiconductor went up 7.8% in the past 60 days, and those for Advanced Energy increased 18.2%.Zacks' 2017 IPO Watch ListBefore looking into the stocks mentioned above, you may want to get a head start on potential tech IPOs that are popping up on Zacks' radar.

Why Alphabet, DryShips, and Sonic Slumped Today;3/20/2017;"Following a strong end to last week as the Federal Reserve   decided to increase interest rates, the stock market was mostly   flat on Monday, with major indexes waffling between positive and   negative territory throughout the day. Still, a few stocks left   investors reeling today, includingAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG)DryShips(NASDAQ: DRYS) , andSonic Corporation(NASDAQ: SONC) . Let's take a closer look at what drove   these declines.Is Google losing its advertising mojo?Shares of Google parent Alphabet fell a modest half percent   after Pivotal Research group analyst Brian Wieser downgraded his   rating on shares to hold from buy, expressing concern that   advertisers are pulling marketing investments from the internet   search titan's platforms over concerns regarding the placement of   their ads. To blame, Pivotal says, was aTimes of Londonreport(may require subscription) last month indicating video ads   from several well-known brands were seen displayed on neo-Nazi   and jihadist websites.Image source: Alphabet.makeArticleAd();In particular, Pivotal notes global advertising company Havas   opted to stop spending on YouTube and Google display ads last   week, while separate reports indicate several industry giants   likeMcDonald's,HSBC, and Audi are all considering similar moves to pull away from   Google advertising.""While Google has apologized for the incidents,"" Wieser added,   ""and while the scale of the underlying problem may be relatively   small in absolute terms, for larger marketers any one instance of   an inappropriate brand placement may be enough to seriously harm   a brand's business value.""DryShips' big offeringNext, shares of dry bulk shipping company DryShips dropped   more than 17% after the company filed for a massive $2 billionmixed shelf offering. The move gives DryShips the flexibility to sell a variety of   its securities to raise money including common shares, preferred   shares debt securities, warrants, purchase contracts, rights, and   units, and provides no specific time table or limit to the number   of offerings it can employ to do so.Dryships has already gone through a staggering transformation   over the past year, from selling ships to pay debt, raising   capital and opening revolving credit facilities to solidify its   balance sheet, and announcing its strategic expansion in the gas   carrier market just over two months ago. But this mixed shelf   offering means more dilution for shareholders is likely coming,   even after the company'squestionable decisionto initiate a fixed $2.5 million quarterly dividend a few weeks   ago.Sonic gives one analyst indigestionFinally, shares of drive-in restaurant chain Sonic fell 3%   after receiving a downgrade to hold from buy at Canaccord   Genuity. Canaccord also reduced its per-share price target on   Sonic to $24 from $30 -- shares currently trade just above $23 --   citing a trend of softer sales lately and longer-term concerns   over increasing competition from ""non-traditional venues"" like   convenience stores.What's more, the analyst firm believes Sonic's recent   discounting will continue, and that its lack of new menu   innovation will do it no favors in today's difficult dining   industry environment. As it stands, investors should receive more   clarity on Sonic's business when the company releases fiscal   second-quarter 2017 results next week. But in the meantime, this   downgrade has pushed Sonic stock to near a fresh 52-week low.Offer from The Motley Fool: The 10 best stocks to buy     nowMotley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more     than a decade beating the market.

Uber's President Quits: Are IPO Plans Toast?;3/20/2017;"Ride-hailing giant Uber Technologies confirmed on Sunday that   its president, Jeff Jones, has resigned.Jones, hired just six months ago, was the second-highest   ranking executive at Uber after CEO and founder Travis Kalanick.   His decision to leave Uber follows the departure of two other   Uber executives in recent weeks, and a growing list of scandals   and challenges that calls into question when -- or whether --   Silicon Valley's most valuable private company will be able to go   public.The challenges facing Uber include an important lawsuit over     its self-driving technology. Image source: Uber     Technologies.makeArticleAd();Two explanations for Jones's departureWhy Jones left depends on who you ask.If you ask Uber, or at least Kalanick, Jones' decision to   depart followed an announcement that Uber has decided to seek a   strong chief operating officer to assist Kalanick in running the   compnay. In a note to Uber staff on Sunday, Kalanick said that   Jones ""came to the tough decision that he doesn't see his future   at Uber"" after the announcement, according to a Recodereport.But if you ask Jones, it was a little more complicated. In a   statement provided to Recode, Jones said, ""It is now clear,   however, that the beliefs and approach to leadership that have   guided my career are inconsistent with what I saw and experienced   at Uber, and I can no longer continue as president of the   ride-sharing business.""Why Jones might have decided to get out nowFor starters, Uber's decision to seek a COO was spurred by an   embarrassing video that showed Kalanick arguing with an Uber   driver over fare reductions that the driver claimed had hurt his   income. It also followed a former Uber employee's serious,credible allegationof a pattern of sexual harassment at the company.Uber has hired two outside law firms to conduct investigations   related to the former employee's claims. One will investigate her   claims specifically, the other is conducting a broader   investigation into Uber's workplace practices.In what may be related developments, two other executives have   departed recently:Uber's senior vice president of engineering, Amit Singhal,     resigned after a reporter from Recodeinformed the companythat Singhal had left a prior job at Google following a     ""credible"" allegation of sexual harassment.Uber's vice president of product and growth, Ed Baker, also     resigned following allegations that he had been seenkissing an Uber employeeat a company event.There's more.The New York Timesreportedearlier this month that Uber has been using a software tool   called ""Greyball"" to deceive authorities in markets where its   service had been pressured by law enforcement or banned.And in perhaps the most dangerous development for the future   of Uber's business,Alphabet's Waymo self-driving subsidiary has sued Uber, claiming that the   head of Uber's self-driving research program, Anthony   Levandowski, took proprietary technology secrets with him when he   left Google in early 2016 to found self-driving truck start-up   Otto, which Uberacquired last summer. Waymo is seeking to halt Uber's self-driving operations. (Uber   has called Waymo's allegations ""baseless,"" but hasn't yet   responded in detail.)Long story short: Uber's growth story could be in serious   trouble.The latest sign that Uber could be in serious troubleTaken together, the recent reports paint a picture of a   company where sexual harassment is tolerated, laws are seen as   inconveniences to be circumvented, and a showcase technology   effort might be based on stolen secrets.That's all bad for obvious reasons, and for one reason that   might be a little less obvious: Like all tech companies, Uber is   in a constant battle to hire and retain top talent. These kinds   of stories hurt.Jones, who had come to Uber fromTargetjust six months ago, apparently decided that he had seen enough.   But his departure raises a big question: What will Uber's   valuation look like the next time it has to raise money -- or   when it attempts to go public?10 stocks we like better than Wal-MartWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock     tip, it can pay to listen.

IBM's Cloud Computing Holds Potential: Should You Buy?;3/20/2017;"International Business Machines Corp'sIBMrecent investor briefing reflected its continuing focus on being a cloud-first company. Notably, cloud revenues grew 35% to $13.7 billion for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock in 2016. You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank   stocks here.makeArticleAd();The annual exit run rate for cloud as-a-service revenue increased 53% on a year-over-year basis to $8.6 billion. Moreover, IBM had more than 50 cloud centers globally and its Bluemix platform was one of the largest open public cloud deployments worldwide at the end of 2016.We note that the impressive growth has helped IBM outperform the S&P 500 in the last one year. While the stock has gained 18.1%, S&P increased 15.3% in the same period.Cloud Computing: Robust Growth ExpectationsWe note that IBM's growth expectations from cloud computing remains positive in the long haul. Management expects market opportunity in enterprise cloud to be greater than $800 billion by 2020. Moreover, the company anticipates more than 85% of enterprises to commit to multi-cloud architectures by 2018, which is positive for its hybrid cloud offerings.As such, the overall growth expectation for the public cloud computing services market is very much bullish. According to Gartner, worldwide public cloud services market is projected to grow 18% over 2016 to $246.8 billion in 2017. Further, the figure will increase to $383.3 billion by 2020.Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) is projected to be the highest growth service driven by improvement in PaaS and massive adoption of artificial intelligence (AI), analytics and the Internet of Things (IoT). IaaS is projected to grow from $25.29 billion in 2016 to $71.55 billion in 2020.IBM Lags Behind in the CloudDespite the impressive growth figures and bullish sentiments, we note that IBM lags behind the likes of AmazonAMZNand MicrosoftMSFTin the public PaaS and IaaS cloud computing markets.According to Synergy Research's latest report Amazon Web Services (AWS) maintained its dominant position in the market followed by Microsoft Azure, Alphabet'sGOOGLGoogle and IBM at the end of fourth-quarter 2016.The research firm noted that these three have gained market share in the last one year at the expense of smaller players as well as strong performance from Microsoft and Google. However, their combined market share of 23% lags a fare bit as compared with Amazon's 40%.We believe that IBM's hybrid approach is yet to find many takers in both the public and private cloud markets. Despite significant investments - first on acquiring SoftLayer for $2 billion and then spending more than $1 billion on data centers - the clientele is not as impressive as Amazon or Microsoft.China: IBM's Savior?Per Gartner, China has become a significant IaaS cloud market. The research firm noted that ""While China's cloud service market is nascent and several years behind the U.S. and European markets, it is expected to maintain high levels of growth as digital transformation becomes more mainstream over the next five years.""IBM is now planning to tap into China's fast- growing cloud computing market through a new company formed in collaboration with Wanda Internet Technology Group. The new company will offer IaaS and Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) to Chinese enterprises and businesses. Reportedly, IBM will have a share in revenues.Moreover, as a part of the deal, the company will launch Watson services to China. IBM is expected to offer Watson Conversation services at the first, which will allow developers to add natural language interactions between applications and client.ConclusionDespite lagging in competition, we believe that IBM is developing a niche for its hybrid cloud services along with ""Strategic Imperatives"" (cognitive computing, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning).IBM Watson on Cloud is a key growth driver in IoT, healthcare and financial services end-markets. IBM Watson is anticipated to reach more than 1 billion people by the end of 2017. Moreover, Blockchain initiatives, Quantum computing, Containers are some of the other catalysts that will support growth trajectory in the long run.Zacks' 2017 IPO Watch ListBefore looking into the stocks mentioned above, you may want to get a head start on potential tech IPOs that are popping up on Zacks' radar.

Alibaba Continues to Diversify, Invests in Gaming Platform;3/20/2017;"Year to date, shares ofAlibaba Group Holding LimitedBABAappreciated 20.3% compared with the Zacks Internet Commerce industry's gain of 18.2%. This outperformance was largely backed by the company's near monopoly in the Chinese e-commerce market and strengthening position beyond it.The company is reportedly investing $145 million (1 billion yuan) in partnerships with some mobile gaming companies to expand mobile game distribution globally.Per CNBC, the Chinese e-commerce giant is putting cash into a number of e-commerce companies to facilitate distribution of games between China and other parts of the world. The report also states that Alibaba will leverage on its big data capacities to suggest game downloads to customers.Eyeing an Attractive IndustryAccording to IDC, China-developed online games grew in double digits, generating $7.2 billion in revenues from overseas in 2016. IDC expects operating revenues of the China gaming market to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12.2% from 2016 to 2020.Revenues from mobile eSports games in China are expected to increase to $7.7 billion by 2020 from $2.5 billion today. China's Virtual Reality (VR) game market size is anticipated grow to $1.5 billion and gaming cloud revenues are likely to touch $525.6 million by 2020.International players are increasingly trying to team up with local Chinese vendors to overcome China's policy issues and bring their games to the market. FacebookFBis trying to team up with Chinese game companies. Last year, Alphabet'sGOOGLGoogle launched a Chinese developers' website to allow local mobile game developers promote their products in international markets. Being a major player in the market, these trends play into Alibaba's sweet spot.Strengthening Position Outside E-commerce and   ChinaInvestment in gaming platform would diversify Alibaba's business as e-commerce growth has slowed down in China. The move can also be a part of Alibaba's bid to strengthen its foothold in the U.S. We will have a clear idea if the report comes out to be true and the company reveals more details about the gaming firms that it is investing in. In 2014, Alibaba invested $120 million in Kabam, a privately held mobile gaming company in the U.S.Alibaba Group Holding Limited Revenue   (Quarterly)Alibaba Group Holding Limited Revenue   (Quarterly)|Alibaba Group Holding Limited QuoteWe note that Alibaba faces tough competition from AmazonAMZNin the U.S. but has successfully prevented Amazon from encroaching into its home turf.The company has been taking other steps to diversify as well. In March, it bought a majority stake in India's Paytm E-Commerce. Apart from buying stakes of e-commerce companies and pushing its AliExpress site in emerging markets, the company is also exploring the offline retail space.In February, the company entered into a strategic partnership with Bailian Group to leverage on its big data capacities and to explore new retail opportunities across outlet design, technology research and development, customer relationship management, supply chain management, payment and logistics.It has also partnered with Intime Retail Group Co Ltd founder, Shen Guojun, in a $2.6 billion bid to privatize Intime and purchased a stake in grocery chain Sanjiang Shopping Club Co Ltd. It has also invested $1.25 billion in a food delivery service in China called Ele.me.We also see Alibaba's growing interest in the global logistics business. The company has been exploring this space with investments in couriers and warehouses in the recent years. It has opened its own logistics service known as Alibaba Logistics.Recently, the company sealed a partnership with Maersk, a unit of Denmark's A.P. Moller-Maersk and the world's biggest container shipping line, to offer online reservation of space on Maersk's vessels. The service eliminates freight forwarders from the booking process and limits their services to haulage.It seems that Alibaba is leaving no stone unturned, in case the online retail industry hits a roadblock.Currently, Alibaba carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

What Is the Internet of Things?;3/18/2017;"Defining the Internet of Things (IoT) can be simplified down   to the connection of everyday things -- like homes, industrial   equipment, watches, etc. -- to the internet, for the purpose of   collecting data, tracking usage, and automating systems. While it   encompasses many technological devices, it's important to   remember that the Internet of Things spans across all major   sectors. The amount of connected IoT objects will reach 50   billion by 2020 and will be worth $7.1 trillion by that same   year.Now that you know a little more about what the IoT is, let's   take a look at how companies are using the IoT right now, and a   few IoT examples you might not know about.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();You've probably already seen the IoT in actionIf you've ever seen anApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Watch or an internet-connectedFitbitfitness tracker, then you're familiar with the Internet of   Things. These devices fall into the broader wearable technology   market and they're what many people think of when they think of   the IoT.Or perhaps you've heard of a Nest programmable thermostat.Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL)  owns Nest, which makes   internet-connected thermostats that you can control via a   smartphone or tablet, and learns your heating and cooling   preferences the more you use it.Both Alphabet andAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) are also pushing the Internet of Things into homes   with their smart home hubs, like Google Home and the Amazon Echo.   Both devices use virtual assistants to answer questions, order   things online, or connect to door locks, lights, and home   security systems. Connected homes are a major part of the   consumer side of the IoT, and will bring in $14 billion in   revenue this year in the U.S.Smartwatches, internet-connected fitness trackers, and smart   home connections are just a few examples of how companies are   investing in the IoT. While there are lots of companies betting   on the Internet of Things, here's a quick list of some of the   biggest players.CompanyIoT FocusMarket CapAppleSmartwatches$729 billionAlphabetSmartwatches, Nest, Android Things, Google Home, Weave         platform, Google Cloud IoT services$590 billionAmazonAlexa-powered devices, AWS IoT$406 billionGeneral Electric(NYSE: GE)Predix software, Asset Performance Management software,         Brilliant Manufacturing software, and IoT security         monitoring$257 billionVerizon Communications(NYSE: VZ)Smart city connections, ThingSpace platform, asset         tracking and management, smart device monitoring, 5G         wireless$201 billionHere's what you might not knowWhile much of the IoT may seem like it's focused on consumer   devices, most of the growth with come from the enterprise market.   Research from BI Intelligence shows that enterprise devices will   account for 40% of all 23.3 billion IoT devices by 2019.Agricultural-equipment makerDeere & Companyusesinternet-connected field equipment, along with sensors, analytics software, and cloud services to   track the efficiency of seed planting. This type of agricultural   technology is transforming how food is grown and how farmers   manage their fields and equipment.Many other non-tech companies are also jumping into the IoT as   well. General Electric, the 125-year-old conglomerate, has   developed its own analytics software for industrial equipment. GE   uses its software to help its customers manage their equipment   more efficiently and anticipate when it needs to be fixed.Scottish and Southern Energyuses GE's Reliability Management software to track its   equipment and maintain uptime, which saves the company an   estimated $3.6 million dollars every year.What the Internet of Things needs to growIn order for more devices, equipment, and services to be added   to the IoT, new and more sophisticated wireless networks are   being developed. Verizon is at the forefront of this change and   said last year that its upcoming 5G network will help address the   IoT's network needs. Verizon will roll out pilot tests of   its 5G network in 11 cities across the U.S. in the first half of   this year.While there's often a lot of hype around new technologies,   it's clear that companies are already taking the IoT seriously   and finding ways to use connected devices and software to offer   better products and services. And if this year is any indicator,   it appears thatnow is one of the best timesfor investors to consider getting on board with this   technological shift.10 stocks we like better than AlphabetWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

This Week in Solar;3/18/2017;"The solar industry had another busy week with a number of   announcements and earnings reports from some of the largest   companies in the business. It was so eventful, in fact, that I   can't cover everything in this week's roundup, but I can hit the   items investors most need be aware of.As the solar industry evolves into a more mature market and   players define where they think they'll have a competitive   advantage, it's time for investors to start looking at where   companies fit into the market and whether they'll have a   profitable future. With that context in mind, here are the   notable news items from the solar industry this week.X-Series solar panels on a residential rooftop. Image     source: SunPower.makeArticleAd();SunPower signs a P-Series supply dealSunPower(NASDAQ: SPWR) has been laying out its plans for the future, and   a central piece of its strategy is based on combining the   P-Series solar panel (which uses commodity cells to create a   slightly higher efficiency ""commodity-plus"" panel) with the Oasis   power plant design. The company is essentially transitioning from   the utility-scale project-building business to supplying   pre-engineered solutions to developers, like utilities. The   strategy makes sense, but we had yet to see much indication that   it was taking hold in the market... until this week.SunPower signed a 125 MW supply agreement withNextEra Energy(NYSE: NEE) to provide its P-Series modules to the developer   between June and October of this year. There wasn't any   disclosure about whether the deal included the Oasis tracking   system or any design services, but even if it's just a panel   supply agreement, it would be a positive sign.If deals like this continue to come through in 2017 and   SunPower is able to supply panels and other services to   developers on short lead times, it would be an immensely positive   development. One deal isn't a confirmation that the   P-Series/Oasis strategy is a success, but it's a step in the   right direction for SunPower shareholders.Google takes Sunroof nationwideAlphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google subsidiary started the   Project Sunroof initiative in 2015 to try to give customers and   installers an easy view of the solar potential of homes around   the country. Initially, the project covered just a few cities,   but the idea was to eventually roll it out nationwide. This week,   that happened.Project Sunroofnow allows people across the country to quickly view an outline   of their home's solar potential, and get an idea of what a solar   system might cost them. Installers can be plugged into the search   to make sales easier, and I would expect some will even use it as   a tool to target sales opportunities. This is one big example of   how solar is becoming a little easier for customers to understand   and see as accessible, particularly outside of traditional solar   hubs such as California and Massachusetts.Trina Solar goes privateIn a deal that has been in the works for months, Trina Solar   was finally taken private this week. The $11.60-per-share offer   made by a group led by the CEO looked to be on shakier ground   late last year as solar panel prices plunged and demand in the   solar market declined, particularly in China.I questioned whether or not the deal would go through given   the questionable history of Chinese buyout offers and the decline   in the market overall. But Trina Solar is now private, and the   fact that the deal went through may mean management sees a   brighter future than many investors currently do.Takeaways from earnings seasonEarnings season is about over for the solar industry, and   afterJA Solar(NASDAQ: JASO) andVivint Solar(NYSE: VSLR)reported this week,there were a few major takeaways from the end of 2016 and early   2017.Chinese solar panel manufacturers are down, but not out.     Gross margins in the fourth quarter were in the low to mid     teens at most manufacturers, and while profitability generally     dropped, they were able to cut costs and remain near breakeven     levels.National residential solar companies are generally in     decline and having a tough time transitioning to a market where     loan and cash sales are the dominant financing option.Sunrunis the one company that has doubled down on leasing, and it's     currently going well for the company. But withSolarCityand Vivint Solar seeing installations decline, there's a lot of     uncertainty about what the residential solar industry will look     like in the future.Technology improvements are coming, and those who stand pat     will eventually get run over. Whether it's First Solar     upgrading from Series 4 to Series 6 solar panels, SunPower     discontinuing most of its mid-level E-Series production in     favor of its high-efficiency X-Series, or the advance of     mono-PERC, efficiency matters more than ever in the solar     industry.That's all for this week in solar.

Investors Are Betting Against U.S. Concrete -- Here's Why They're Wrong;3/18/2017;"The construction industry is highly cyclical. When the general   economy is doing well, or even booming, the industry usually   isn't far behind. When growth slows or a recession strikes, the   appetite for construction projects takes a big hit. Luckily for   investors, we're currently in the midst of a broad economic   expansion.That has made construction companies, and specifically those   of cement and concrete manufacturers, some of the best-performing   stocks over the last three years.Vulcan MaterialsandMartin Marietta Materialshave nearly tripled the returns of the S&P 500 during that   period, while the smallerU.S. Concrete(NASDAQ: USCR) has gained an incredible 181%.Although there are great fundamentals supporting the stock's   rise, investors appear to be suspicious. Slightly over 28% of the   the company's shares are traded short, according to numbers   compiled by Yahoo! Finance. There's no denying that shares have   outperformed most other stocks, but I think investors are wrong   to bet against U.S. Concrete. Here's why.makeArticleAd();Image source: Getty Images.Why short-sellers are wrongThe stock trades at an eye-popping 125 times trailing   earnings, but there's an innocent, if not downright weird,   explanation. It may sound odd, but the better the stock performs,   the bigger the company's GAAP net loss becomes. That's because   U.S. Concrete must account for non-cash derivative gains and   losses from fair value changes in its issued warrants when the   stock price moves down or up, respectively, in any given   period.The good news is that recent quarterly GAAP net losses have no   impact on the company's cash position and have not had major   impacts on the share price. The great news is that operations   have maintained a strong level of performance for several years   in a row.U.S. Concrete notched $75 million in operating income and   $1.17 billion in revenue in 2016. Those metrics grew 235% and   95%, respectively, from the performance achieved three years ago.   Operating cash flow reached $112 million last year, which was   well above the $24 million achieved in 2013.In other words, the stock has certainly earned its 181% gain   in the last three years.USCRdata byYCharts.That said, there's a strong case to be made that the company's   growth isn't over. Unlike other cement and concrete   manufacturers, U.S. Concrete has strategically (and almost   exclusively) focused on major metropolitan areas in Texas, New   York/New Jersey, and northern California. Those markets were   responsible for 38%, 31%, and 25%, respectively, of total revenue   in 2016. There are several advantages to that strategy that   short-sellers may be overlooking.First, it allows the company to strategically acquire assets   to become a major and dominant player in each region and city.   Consider that in 2016 alone, U.S. Concrete acquired four smaller   ready-mix concrete operators in the Bronx, Queens, and Brooklyn.   The acquisitions provided the company with 10 ready-mix concrete   plants and 189 mixer trucks. In addition to swiping away   competition, the acquisitions allow the company to make more   competitive bids on larger projects. And in New York City, there   are some pretty big projects.In fact, the company supplied the concrete that built the new   World Trade Center Complex, including Freedom Tower, which was   the highest height concrete has ever been pumped in North   America. Expansions at LaGuardia Airport and the Modern Museum of   Art were also aided by the company, as are other major ongoing   projects in the New York, Dallas-Fort Worth, and San Francisco   metropolitan areas.Second, extending its leadership position in each major market   allows U.S. Concrete to have a greater influence on product   pricing. The fourth quarter of 2016 marked the 23rd straight   quarter that the company achieved year-over-year ready-mix   concrete price increases. That has an obviously beneficial impact   on revenue and margins, and it has played a huge role in the   company's industry-leading margins in the ready-mix concrete   segment. Whereas the average material spread margin in the   industry was 45% last year, U.S. Concrete achieved 49.2%.US Industrial Production: Cementdata byYCharts.Third, operating in urban environments allows the company to   benefit from environmental considerations and initiatives, such   as LEED building certifications. Humans manufacture more cement   than any other material. Unfortunately, cement is also one of the   most carbon-intensive materials to produce, accounting for 5% oftotal global CO2 emissionseach year. While certain materials can be substituted into cement   production processes, they can significantly alter the   performance of mixed concrete. In other words, it's not easy   being green.Luckily, U.S. Concrete is a leading producer of low CO2   concrete. The company's EF Technology can reduce the greenhouse   gas emissions associated with cement production by between 42%   and 46%. Today, over 30% of concrete used by the company benefits   from the technology. That allows it to place highly competitive   bids on major construction projects with LEED requirements -- an   increasingly important consideration. That's especially true in   environmentally conscious San Francisco, where the company has   won projects including the Google Bayview Campus, the Workday   Campus, and even the Golden State Warriors Arena.What does it mean for investors?It takes a bit of digging around the company's primary   strategy and the driving forces for the industry at large, but I   think short-sellers are wrong about this stock. The only way   short-sellers could be right about U.S. Concrete stock is if the   American economy heads for a slowdown, which would have much   broader consequences. While that's not impossible -- in fact,   with recessions occurring every eight years or so, we're ""due""   for one -- it's unlikely to sneak up on investors. The company   works off of a backlog of projects that are agreed to years   prior, which provides fair warning to shareholders of potential   trouble on the horizon. Right now, though, there appears to   be consistent growth ahead for the foreseeable future.10 stocks we like better than US ConcreteWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Microsoft and Alphabet Are Catching Up to Amazon in the Cloud;3/17/2017;"Amazon.com's(NASDAQ: AMZN) all-important Amazon Web Services (AWS) segment   has been the undisputed leader of cloud infrastructure, by far,   for years. The most recent third-party estimate from Canalys pegs   AWS global market share at nearly 34% in the fourth quarter,   larger than the next three largest competitors --Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) ,Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) , andIBM-- combined (31%).Competition is heating up, and rivals are starting to chip   away at AWS' dominance.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();AWS is hugely important to the Amazon thesisThat's the underlying theme of a research note from Pacific   Crest (viaTech Trader Daily). Analyst Brent Bracelin is reiterating an overweight rating but   slightly reducing his price target from $905 to $895, while   expressing some concern that Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud are   starting to catch up and ""becom[e] more viable."" The software and   search giants both continue to invest heavily in their cloud   offerings, both in terms of technical capability as well as   geographic expansion and reach.Since AWS is immensely more profitable that Amazon's core   e-commerce business, its results carry a disproportionate weight   when it comes to the bottom line, and strong AWS performance has   been a key driver of Amazon's rally over the past two years,   which has seen shares more than double.AMZNdata byYCharts.Microsoft Azure is making inroads at large enterprise   customers and government agencies, which are increasingly   transitioning their needs away from their own data center   infrastructures and toward public cloud platforms. Google Cloud   has scored a high-profile win inSnap, which has committed to spending $2 billion with the search   giant and is onlyusing AWS as a backup. Google also recently announced a handful of other big wins for   its cloud business.Bracelin still believes that AWS has a ""multiyear competitive   lead,"" despite rivals starting to catch up in different ways. As   a result, he is tempering his expectations for growth for the   next two years. Overall, the analyst considers decelerating   growth a ""minor concern,"" but it's definitely something that   should be on investors' radar.Rising cloud use lifts all infrastructure vendorsIt's worth pointing out that the cloud infrastructure market   is growing so fast -- up 49% last year and expected to jump   another 46% this year -- that there should be plenty to go   around. The cloud infrastructure market could generate a total of   $55.8 billion in total revenue this year. Of course, the dominant   vendors will compete aggressively, but we're not talking about   zero-sum competition.10 stocks we like better than AmazonWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

3 Companies Set to Make a Killing From Driverless Cars;3/17/2017;"Driverless car technology is still in its nascent stage but   will grow in leaps and bounds in the coming years. IHS Automotive   forecasts that autonomous vehicle sales will shoot up from   600,000 units in 2025 to almost 21 million by 2035, clocking a   compound annual growth rate of 43%.The Boston Consulting Group, meanwhile, expects the driverless   car market to create a $42 billion revenue opportunity in 2025   itself, indicating that there is a lot of money to be made in   this space. One of the ways to tap this huge opportunity is   through technology providers such asAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) ,Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) , andNVIDIA(NASDAQ: NVDA) , as they will play mission-critical roles in   enabling autonomous cars.NVIDIA's GPUs are boosting self-driving technologyNVIDIA is best known for making gaming graphics cards, but its   products are in high demand from automakers as well.Tesla, for instance, is using the chipmaker's artificial   intelligence-based DRIVE PX2 platform in the Model S and Model X   cars. What's more, the automaker is also going to deploy NVIDIA's   supercomputer in its mass-market Model 3.makeArticleAd();The Tesla partnership is already delivering results, as   NVIDIA's automotive revenue shot up over 37% year over year for   the fiscal fourth quarter. The company could sustain its   automotive momentum, as it is working with German giant Audi to   bring a Level 4 autonomous car to the market by 2020. Level 4   means it can drive itself entirely on its own.The two companies showcased an Audi Q7 at CES earlier this   year, claiming that the car learned to drive on its own in just   four days using NVIDIA's AI-based DRIVE PX2 supercomputer. More   importantly, NVIDIA is looking to push the envelope: It's now   working on a more advanced supercomputing platform -- Xavier --   that consumes less power but packs more computing capacity.NVIDIA's graphics processing units accelerate the processing   of huge amounts of data in real time, allowing the vehicle to   make quick decisions. As the company increasingly turns its   attention toward making its self-driving supercomputers better   through partnerships with big auto companies, it won't be   surprising if its platform ends up powering fully autonomous cars   by 2020.NVIDIA, therefore, looks right on the edge of tapping the   driverless car opportunity, as 80 companies are using the DRIVE   PX2 platform to develop their technology.Microsoft's big data opportunityDriverless cars, or any connected car for that matter, will   generate huge volumes of data from their sensors and cameras that   will need storage and processing. Microsoftwants to ingestall this data and then use its artificial intelligence (AI)   skills to analyze it to help cars drive better through its Azure   cloud-based Connected Vehicle Platform.Image source: Microsoft.The Redmond-based company has picked a sweet spot to tap the   driverless car opportunity, as a connected vehicle is slated to   produce 20 gigabytes of data per day in 2017 if driven for just   two hours. In the case of autonomous cars, the data generation   could be at least 10 gigabytes per second. Now, all this data   can't be stored on the car itself due to limited storage   capacity, creating an opportunity for Microsoft to push its cloud   product to automakers.TheRenault-Nissanalliance has already decided to use the software giant's   connected vehicle platform, pledging to put 10 cars with   autonomous technology on the road by 2020. Additionally, Indian   automakerTata Motorsis adopting the platform to bring connectivity   features and predictive maintenance at affordable prices to   mass-market vehicles in India.Microsoft is also finding demand for its connected car   platform beyond automakers. For instance, reinsurance provider   Swiss Re will analyze driving behavior with the help of the   telematics data collected by the cloud, and then create   customized insurance deals for customers.The inevitable data increase from driverless and connected   cars could power Microsoft's Azure cloud business to new highs in   the long run, allowing it to sustain rapid revenue growth from   this segment.Image source: Waymo.Alphabet's Waymo moonshot could be a big businessAlphabet's Waymo division has thebest driverless cartechnology, according to data from the California DMV. As it   turns out, its driverless cars have the lowest incidence rates   and the highest miles logged compared to the others testing their   technology on California roads.Alphabet can use its lead in this space by becoming an   infrastructure and knowledge supplier to auto companies, and this   is what it is probably planning to do. Earlier this year, Waymo   announced that it is going to manufacture   driverless-technology-enabling sensors on its own so that it can   better integrate the software into hardware.In fact, the Waymo division has slashed the price of the   crucial LIDAR sensor by 90% since 2009, so it makes sense for it   to offer a packaged hardware-software bundle to potential   customers. The company has already gained a customer in the form   ofFiat Chrysler Automobilesfor its self-driving technology, with Bloombergreportingthat both companies could eventually roll out a ride-sharing   service.On the other hand,Hondaseems to be warming up to Waymo's self-driving capabilities to   accelerate its own driverless car development. The Japanese   automaker is now exploring the possibility of equipping its cars   with fully autonomous driving technology in cities instead of its   earlier ambition of just highway driving.Therefore, Alphabet's years of leadership in driverless cars   make it one of the hottest prospects to benefit from this   emerging technology.10 stocks we like better than MicrosoftWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock       tip, it can pay to listen.

After that, it's Facebook, which has generated 265%. Amazon's 360% return stands out and Netflix's 830% gain jumps off the page. Have these stocks gone too far, though?7 Small-Cap Tech Stocks on the Cutting EdgeI wouldn't necessarily argue that. Some names warrant some extra caution in my view, however. Let's take a further look to see which stocks are worth holding onto and which are worth taking profits in.FANG Stocks: Facebook (FB)Source:The Crunchies! via FlickrWe'll keep the FANG stocks in order, so let's begin withFacebook. Facebook has impressively captivated billions of users through its platform. At last check, Facebook catered to 1.23 billion daily active users, an 18% increase year-over-year. Monthly active users of 1.86 billion increased 17% year-over-year.Even more impressively, Facebook has found a way to grow its revenue growth. That may seem like a typo, but it's not. FB has managed to not only grow sales on a year-over-year basis, but also accelerate that rate of growth as well. After impressively growing sales in the 40% to 49% range through fiscal 2015, FB has now managed 50%+ revenue growth for five consecutive quarters. Obviously the company hasfound a way to continually growand its users are not tiring of its various ad formats.FB stock is not egregiously priced either; with a forward price-earnings ratio of just 21, Facebook shares are not that expensive with earnings per share expected to grow 28.1% this year and 23.4% next year.Throw in the fact that Facebook has topped earnings expectations over the past 13 quarters and the stock becomes even more attractive. Shares have been on a tear this year. But a pullback to its 50-day moving average near $131 could be a buying opportunity.FANG Stocks: Amazon (AMZN)Source: ShutterstockAMZN stockhas also done well in 2017, up 14%. We all know about the decaying retail sector and Amazon's ability to capitalize on that weakness. But judging the future of commerce can be difficult, especially with how quickly Amazon continues to move.The biggest concern for Amazon skeptics has been earnings. Despite years of 20%-plus revenue growth, AMZN's bottom line has hugged the flatline. Management argues that it's investing in itself for even more growth and so far, investors have been patient. They've also been rewarded. Over the past 10 years, shares are up more than 2,000%. Thankfully, Amazon started to pad its bottom line with its Web Services cloud business.While I personally love Amazon, I would be a bit leery of AMZN stock at these prices. Just last year we found out the hard way how fast things can change with sentiment. In the beginning of 2016, AMZN stock stumbled from $675 to sub-$500 in just five weeks. That 26% haircut startled plenty of investors, despite the stock rebounding to north of $800 a share within a year.The lesson here is simple: Amazon shares are not invincible during pullbacks. Should we get a notable broader market correction, AMZN stock will not be spared. That is the best time tobuy the stock. Now that it's through the holiday season andcontinues to invest at a heavy pace, shares could struggle in the intermediate term.7 Small-Cap Tech Stocks on the Cutting EdgeA decline to its 200-day moving average would be a great place to initiate a long position. That mark is currently near $780 per share. Any further declines could be used to accumulate the stock.FANG Stocks:Netflix (NFLX)Source:Via NetflixNFLX stockis one a lot of investors are kicking themselves over. Shares languished below $100 through most of 2016. At the time, some feared higher content costs and sloppy overseas execution.Those fears still exist to some point, but Netflix has shown better execution as of late. As a result, shares have catapulted to north of $140. The stock has been consolidating nicely around this level. With the 50-day moving average just below, it appears Netflix may be setting up for amove to new all-time highs.Investors who want to buy now could use the 50-day moving average - or a price just below - as their stop-loss. They could also wait for a possible decline to its 200-day moving average, currently just below $115, to buy. Longer-term investors may consider initiating a position in the name, with a plan to purchase more on additional declines.The problem with NFLX stock is simple: valuation. Not many investors question the shift in video content consumption. The trend is in favor of Netflix, which holds a dominant position in the streaming world. I consider Netflix a very battleground-based stock. On the one hand, it's trailing P/E ratio of 384 is near the top of its five-year range. On the other hand, its forward P/E ratio is the lowest it's been in the same time frame.The streaming offerings from Alphabet's YouTube, as well asHulucould also be a concern. For now, the bulls seem to be in control of NFLX stock. Should Netflix's execution deteriorate or competition eat into its growth, the narrative may change. But for now, staying long Netflix seems like it will work.FANG Stocks: Alphabet (GOOGL)Source: ShutterstockLike Facebook, one of the main attractions toAlphabetis actually the valuation. Trading at 21.8 times next year's earnings, shares of Alphabet aren't priced too expensive. Analysts expect GOOGL to churn out earnings growth of 17.5% next year, along with 19.3% annual earnings growth over the next five years.Alphabet's founders may have paved the way for internet domination. But there's a new team member to its C-suite that has given GOOGL a much-needed boost. CFO Ruth Porat joined the company in May 2015.In the year leading up to her hire, shares had been stagnant, returning just 5%. Since her addition, though, the stock is up a whopping 60%. Does it also seem like a coincidence that Alphabet missed analysts' estimates on at least six straight quarters prior to her arrival? Since then, Alphabet has topped estimates in five of the past six quarters.Admittedly, Alphabet's transparency has been better, making it easier for analysts to form estimates. But this added clarity makes it easier on investors and helps lower volatility. For better or for worse, Alphabet takes some gambles. For instance, consider Alphabet's self-driving car unit, Waymo. Porat has not stifled this growth. Rather, she has reigned in expenses and channeled GOOGL's focus. As a result, the bottom line has improved,without future potential being eliminated.8 Places to Run and Hide in a Market CrashWith a consistent core business in Google and potential upsides in businesses like Waymo, GOOGL stock is attractive. With its dependable growth and a reasonable valuation, it's even better. At just a hair under all-time highs, though, now may not be the best time to buy. A retest of its 50-day moving average near $840 and a further decline to its 200-day moving average near $800 would offer better entry opportunities.As of this writing, Bret Kenwell did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.The post4 Famous Tech Stocks That Could Lose Their Fangsappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Privacy Revamp Makes Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Even More Attractive;3/17/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsScore one for civil liberties. This week, social networking giantFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) overhauled its privacy policies,blocking police departments from using the siteas a means of keeping tabs on users who may also be associated with violent protesting.makeArticleAd();On the surface, it may seem irrelevant to the current and future value of Facebook stock. Most members of the ad-driven platform know they're of no interest to law enforcement officials, and the protestors that were making themselves known on the social media site likely didn't know they were being watched (and therefore didn't alter the way and frequency with which they used the website).In other words,so what?Thing is, it's more than conceivable there were enough users of the Facebook platform that had been steering clear due to privacy concerns - just on principle - to expect them to log on now that their privacy is being protected.Privacy Remains Contentious TopicIt's neither a new debate, nor is it a minor one.Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL)battled the FBI early last yearover the bureau's request that the company unlock an iPhone as part of a terrorism investigation.Alphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) has long been deemed to be too intrusive,keeping a detailed dossier on everyone who uses Google and its servicesthat facilitates more target marketing.EvenWal-Mart Stores Inc(NYSE:WMT) is getting in on the snooping act,using cameras to watch what shoppers pick up in stores, and then put down without purchasing.So, in the grand scheme of things, it's not difficult to believe that Facebook was looking the other way when it knew law enforcement officials were using its platform as a new tool in the war on crime.7 Dividend Stocks With Yields That Grow Like WeedsThe question Facebook stock holders should be asking: At what point does accommodating every policy and agency request make the website too alarming for even the average user to visit?The American Civil Liberties Union asked the question, and thenanswered it in a way that put Facebook in a questionable light. The company responded with a change in its policy.New Policies Curtail PinpointingAs of Monday, police and other law enforcement agenciescan no longer tap Geofeedia's data, which was built to pinpoint where Facebook users are - Facebook completely cut off Geofeedia's access to the site. It's not necessarily a permanent hurdle, but it is one that will remain in place indefinitely on the location-based analytics platform.Facebook's deputy chief privacy officer Rob Sherman commented: ""Our goal is to make our policy explicit.""New PageThe clarified policy does not preclude FB from assisting law enforcement officials on a case-by-case basis. Indeed, the company says it still intends to assist police when appropriate. Presumably, this would mean instances where a search warrant has been issued, which requires a reasonable suspicion that retrieving such information would help lead to a successful prosecution.Twitter Inc(NYSE:TWTR) and Facebook unit Instagram also booted Geofeedia from using their websites to gather and sell user information following the ACLU's exposure of the organization's invasive tactics.Bottom Line for Facebook StockOn the surface it seems like a potential setback for Facebook, and by extension for Facebook stock. One of the most compelling features of the social media platform to advertisers was the deep, broad, and well-defined data the company could collect about each and every user.If it's scaling that detail back - and presumably it's doing so to more developers than just Geofeedia - then the potential value to advertisers is crimped.Amgen, Inc. (AMGN) Stock Crashed. Here's How to Trade.Don't overthink it, though, and don't assume there's a cut-and-dried if/then relationship between how invasive a website can be and how valuable detailed user data is to an advertiser. They say they want stratification, but many advertisers are content to promote their product or service to any reasonably targeted consumer.On the other hand, consumers are more apt to use caution when it comes to websites that may nefariously collect data on a consumer, even without their consent or knowledge. People have a decent sixth sense when it comes to being unreasonably monitored.In other words, a FB that's more interested in basic civil rights is a better investment than one that's not. The trade-off is more than palatable.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace7 Blue-Chip Stocks Holding You Back10 Mutual Funds You Can Buy and Hold Forever10 Monthly Dividend Stocks to Buy to Pay the BillsThe postPrivacy Revamp Makes Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Even More Attractiveappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Google and Facebook Will Account for 74% of Digital Ad Growth in 2017;3/17/2017;"Marketers will continue to shift a larger percentage of their   ad budgets to digital in 2017. U.S. digital ad spending is   expected to reach $83 billion this year, up 16% according toeMarketer.By far, the two biggest digital advertisers areFacebook(NASDAQ: FB) and Google, a subsidiary ofAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) . The two will combine to take 57%   of the market this year. That's up from 54% last year as the two   combine to take about 74% of all the growth in U.S. ad spend.Even with the recent introduction of ads on the extremely   popular Snapchat fromSnap(NYSE: SNAP) and continued pressure fromTwitter(NYSE:TWTR) andMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) , the two giants continue to completely dominate   the competition.makeArticleAd();Image source: Google.Google search takes $0.78 of every dollarGoogle's biggest business, search, is also its biggest growth   driver. Google's search ad revenue is expected to climb 16% this   year compared to its overall revenue growth of 15%. eMarketer   expects Google to take 78% of all U.S. search ad spend as it   takes share from Microsoft and other smaller competitors. The   search giant will bring in about $28.6 billion from search ads   this year, according to the research group.Google's growth stems largely from mobile. Android is the most   popular mobile operating system in the U.S., and Google is the   default search engine on iOS, the second most popular mobile   operating system. Microsoft's efforts to penetrate the mobile   market largely fell flat, although it is the search engine behind   Siri on iOS.Americans use Google for about 94% of their searches on   mobile. As mobile continues to account for more and more of our   time, Google's lead in search will only grow wider.Facebook dominates display advertisingWhile Google grows more dominant in search, Facebook is   increasingly dominant in display ads. eMarketer expects   Facebook's U.S. advertising to grow 32.1% to $16.33 billion this   year. Google is its next closest competitor, and it's expected to   generate just $5.24 billion from display ads.Image source: Facebook.eMarketer's projection for U.S. ad revenue growth is actually   below analysts' consensus estimate for Facebook's overall revenue   growth this year. It's worth noting the U.S. is historically   Facebook's largest and one of the faster-growing regions in terms   of revenue. However, saturation in ad load could cause U.S. ad   growth to slow more significantly compared to regions where   Facebook has faster user growth.Instagram will make a significant contribution to Facebook's   U.S. ad revenue this year, growing to account for about 20% of   Facebook's total on mobile, up from 15% last year. Mobile   accounted for 84% of Facebook's total ad revenue last   quarter.The competition can't touch Facebook or GoogleOne of Facebook and Google's biggest competitors in display   advertising, Twitter, is expected to see its mobile ad revenue   decline for the first time in its history. Its revenue on mobile   devices will fall about 5% to $1.15 billion, according to   eMarketer. Mobile accounted for 89% of Twitter's total ad revenue   in the fourth quarter.The expected to decline comes after management provided anemic   first-quarter guidance and followed it up byde-emphasizing certain ad products. Twitter is shifting its focus to its most profitable products   in order to make good on its effort to become profitable this   year.Meanwhile, Snapchat is a growing force in video ads. Indeed,   eMarketer expects the company's U.S. ad revenue to grow 158% to   $770 million. Even with its robust growth, Snap's app revenue   still only accounts for 1.2% of the total U.S. mobile ad market,   and just 4% of the total growth in U.S. digital advertising.Even with strong competition, Facebook and Google continue to   dominate the market as users flock to their services. The trends   favor both to continue growing faster than the rest of the   industry for the foreseeable future, too.10 stocks we like better than FacebookWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

5 Signs Snap Inc's High Growth Days are Over;3/17/2017;"Snap(NYSE: SNAP) , the parent company of Snapchat, made its public   debut on March 3, and the results were underwhelming. Snap made   its public debut at $17, surged to nearly $30 on the first day,   then tumbled back to just over $20 in less than two weeks.Why did investors seemingly snub Snap, which some bulls have   hailed as the ""nextFacebook(NASDAQ: FB) ""? The answer is simple -- six red flags indicate   that the stock could slide much lower before it's considered a   bargain.Snap's Android app. Image source: Google Play.makeArticleAd();1. Slowing user growthThe decline ofTwitter's (NYSE:TWTR) stocktaught usthat social networks live and die by their active user growth.   Without active user growth, advertisers start skipping the   platform in favor of faster growing ones. Snapchat's daily active   users (DAUs) rose just  3% sequentially to 158 million last   quarter, compared to 7% growth in the third quarter and 17%   growth in the second quarter.That slowdown was likely caused by the launch of new   Snapchat-like features for Facebook's Instagram and Messenger   apps -- which include Instagram Stories, vanishing Instagram   photos, Instant Video for Messenger, and a Messenger Day app   which deletes photos and videos after 24 hours. Instagram   Stories, in particular, grew its DAUs from 100 million to 150   million between last October and  this January.2. Its cash burn rateSnap's S-1 filing revealed that it finished fiscal 2016 with   just $150.1 million in cash and equivalents -- a 77% decline from   $640.8 million at the end of 2015. The company had a negative   operating cash flow of $188 million in the fourth quarter of   2016, and it burned through $1.14 in cash for each dollar in    generated revenue.Snap will retain $2.3 billion of the $3.2 billion it    raised during its IPO. That amount will help Snap tread   water for a while, but it might not last long if its cash burn   rate accelerates. Susquehanna analysts believe that Snap won't   achieve positive free cash flow until fiscal 2020. However, that   estimate could be far too optimistic if rivals like Instagram   Stories continue throttling Snapchat's growth.3. Widening lossesSnap's revenue surged 590% to $404.5 million in 2016. But on   the bottom line, its net losswidenedfrom $372.9 million to $514.6 million. The company's biggest   expenses include multi-billion dollar cloud contracts withAlphabet's Google andAmazon.If Snap can't narrow its losses with such massive revenue   growth, things could getveryugly once its top line growth slows down. Snap has also warned in   its SEC filing that it ""may never achieve or maintain   profitability.""4. Unrealistic revenue growth targetsSnap claims that it can  generate $500 million to $1   billion in revenues in 2017. That's a very wide range, but   analysts are modeling their forecasts on  the high-end, with   an average estimate of $1.04 billion. However, it's unclear how   Snap plans to hit that target.The three types of Snap ads. Image source: Snap.96% of Snap's revenue came from advertising in 2016. Snap's ad    products include full-screen video ads, sponsored   geofilters, and sponsored lenses. If Snap's user growth peaks, it   could possibly boost its number of marketing partners to generate   higher ad revenues per customer. But more than doubling its 2016   revenues to $1 billion in 2017 seems like ahugestretch.Research firm eMarketer recently trimmed its 2017 ad    revenue forecast for Snapchat from $800 million to $770   million. That reduction was modest, but it indicates that   analysts aren't certain that it can hit its ambitious growth   targets.5. It thinks it's a ""camera company""Co-founder and CEO Evan Spiegel has repeatedly declared that   Snap is different from other social networks because it's a   ""camera company."" Tthat statement sounded reasonable because it   produced special filters and lenses for smartphone cameras, but   rivals like Instagram can easily make similar claims.Snap's Spectacles. Image source: Snap.Spiegel didn't say that Snap would sell physical cameras   anytime soon, but the company launched its Spectacles   Snap-capturing glasses late last year. The devices attracted lots   of shoppers, thanks to a clever marketing campaign featuring   vanishingvending machines.If Snap builds upon that idea, it could start selling other   cheap image capture devices to build its brand and differentiate   itself from Instagram. However, that move could cause it to burn   through its cash even faster and weigh down its bottom line with   a low-margin hardware business.Should you avoid Snap?Snap looks like a company that went public before it formed a   coherent roadmap toward positive cash flows and profitability.   Without the ability to reach those goals, Snap remains an   incredibly overvalued stock at nearly 60 times sales.To put that into perspective, Facebook had a P/S ratio of   about 10 at the close of its first trading day. Twitter ended its   first day with a P/S ratio of about 11. This means that Snap   could easily plummet to the single digits if investors realize   that this ephemeral emperor has no clothes.10 stocks we like better than Snap Inc.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

IBM Watson Health Inks Deal with MedyMatch for Healthcare AI;3/17/2017;"International Business Machines CorporationIBMowned Watson Health has recently inked a five-year agreement with MedyMatch, an artificial intelligence (AI) startup based in Israel. The objective of the deal is to integrate MedyMatch's AI technology with Watson Health for enhanced detection of bleeding in the brain as a result of stroke or head trauma.Initially, IBM Watson Health will launch the MedyMatch brain bleeding detection application globally. Later, the two companies will proceed toward integrating and achieving interoperability between IBM Watson Health's imaging offerings and MedyMatch's AI application.Reportedly, IBM will incur several millions of dollars as recurring annual licensing fees to MedyMatch over the span of the agreement.Notably, shares of IBM have underperformed the ZacksComputer - Integrated Systemsindustry over the last one year. While the industry gained a modest 24.3%, the stock appreciated only 20.5%.The underperformance of the stock could be due to the time consuming transition to the cloud, weakness in traditional businesses and lower IT spending worldwide. However, we expect the stock to rebound given such strategic deals.What Does This Mean for IBM?As per a report by the World Health Organization, nearly 7.6 million people are likely to be affected by stroke by 2030. As per another report by Zion Market Research, worldwide spending on global stroke diagnostics and therapeutics is estimated to reach $31 billion by 2021 at a CAGR of 7%.There is thus a huge scope for application of IBM's cognitive technology as it helps in detecting bleeding in the brain as a result of stroke or trauma.We note that Watson Health has been fast gaining traction in the recent times. Earlier this month, the company launched IBM Watson Imaging Clinical Review, a cognitive imaging offering, at the Health IT Conference for 2017 to address various cardiovascular diseases. (Read More:IBM Watson Introduces Cognitive Imaging to Boost Healthcare).Also, earlier this year, IBM Watson Health partnered with the FDA to advance cancer research.

3 Stocks to Buy -- Even in a Bull Market;3/17/2017;"There's no doubt about it: We're right smack in the middle of   a bull market. The S&P 500 is up about 70% over the past five   years and about 18% in the past 12 months alone. While this   is great for investors who already own stocks, it means it's more   difficult for investors to find attractive stocks to buy   today.But rest assured there are still some solid long-term bets.   Here are three that stand out even in this raging bull market:Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) ,Yum! Brands(NYSE: YUM) , andWells Fargo(NYSE: WFC) . Even after rising about 17%, 14%, and 19%,   respectively, in the past 12 months, each of these stocks still   looks attractive today.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();AlphabetWhile Alphabet, parent company of Google, is a pure technology   stock, investors shouldn't automatically assume it's just another   risky tech stock. On the contrary, Alphabet's leadership in   search has carved out a wide economic moat for the company.Alphabet's Google advertising business, which comprises about   86% of Alphabet's total revenue, is driven by the company's   powerful search business. Helping Google's advertising revenue   increase 17% year over year, Alphabet's search business not only   remains dominant, but its lead over competition even seems to be   increasing. Research company eMarketer recently forecasted   Alphabet's share of U.S. search advertising will increase from   75.8% to 80% in 2018, thanks to the company's timely and   aggressive investments in mobile search.With a price-to-earnings ratio of about 30, Alphabet isn't   cheap. But a wide economic moat and persistent strong growth make   this stock worth owning.Yum! BrandsYum! Brands offers investors a way to buy into a collection of   some of the most well-known food franchises on the planet: KFC,   Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell. With these highly scalable   quick-service restaurants under its ownership, Yum! Brands is   well positioned to not only grow, but also to pay investors a   solid dividend while it's at it; management expects annualized   growth in system sales and operating profit of about 7% in   constant currency, and the stock currently offers a dividend   yield of about 1.9%.With a price-to-earnings ratio of about 26, Yum! Brands   certainly isn't trading at a deep discount. But its sustainable   business model and management's expectations for robust system   sales make this stock look tasty.Wells FargoAs the biggest bank in the U.S. measured by deposits, Wells   Fargo is a bet on a bank with significant scale. Add in Wells   Fargo's emphasis of enduring customer relationships, operational   excellence, and conservative risk management, Wells Fargo is   nearly in a class of its own.While the bank's sales culture created some ethical problems   for the company recently, it's worth noting that even famed   investor Warren Buffett'sBerkshire Hathawayhasn't sold a single share of the bankamid the high-profile headlines -- a notable move considering   Wells Fargo is Berkshire's biggest holding, valued at about $30   billion.While Wells Fargo is up sharply recently, its attractiveness   is highlighted by its 2.6% dividend yield and its conservative   price-to-book ratio of 1.7 (which is still well below   pre-recession levels). Further, the stock still trades at a   fairly conservative price-to-earnings ratio of about 15.In a bull market like this, a pullback in the overall stock   market is certainly possible -- and these three stocks could very   well suffer along with the market if this happens. But these are   the sort of stocks that have a good chance of performing solidly   on a five-year time horizon even if they are purchased at today's   prices.10 stocks we like better than AlphabetWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

"Google Eyes Algorithm Enhancement, Flags ""Offensive"" Content";3/17/2017;"makeZacksArticleAd();Alphabet Inc.'sGOOGLGoogle is reportedly taking steps to spot potentially upsetting or offensive content and reduce their appearance on the search results page. This will result in more accurate, realistic and truthful information for users.Guidelines Updated With a New SectionGoogle uses around 10,000 contractors across the world as quality raters of its search results. The company has added the option of flagging ""Upsetting-Offensive"" content in its guidelines to these quality raters.They now can now flag content that promotes harmful activities such as discrimination or violence against any group of people, animal cruelty, child abuse, racial slurs or human trafficking. Basically any hurtful or displeasing content may be flagged depending upon the motive of a search.The Broader Plan of Algorithm EnhancementData from quality raters will be used to train human coders (search algorithm writers) as well as update machine learning system on how to differentiate upsetting and offensive content from factual and appropriate ones.The broader aim is to make search algorithms capable of automatically flagging such content. This can happen if the algorithms better understand the motive of a particular search and display results accordingly.However, that doesn't necessarily mean that that an offensive or upsetting content will not appear on the search results page. Rather, the enhanced search algorithm will display results if it finds an explicit search being made for such content.We believe that Google's near-monopoly position in the search market is likely to drive Alphabet's stock price going ahead. Its shares have appreciated 15.2% in the last one year compared with the ZacksInternet-Servicesindustry'sgain of 11.6%.Our TakeWe believe that updates of this kind will improve Google's search quality and furnish quality results.

Why This Market Researcher Lowered Its Revenue Expectations for Snap;3/16/2017;"Analysts haven't been kind toSnap(NYSE: SNAP) since it made its IPO. Not one analyst has given   Snap stock a buy rating, and shares have fallen considerably from   its opening price at the beginning of the month.Most recently, market researcher eMarketer lowered its   expectations for Snap's U.S. ad revenue from $800 million to $770   million. The reason behind the lower estimate is   ""higher-than-estimated revenue sharing with partners.""Snapchat offers revenue sharing as an incentive for content   publishers to use its Publisher Stories (formerly Discover)   format. Snap is also partnering with various media companies to   produce original shows, which may provide even more favorable   revenue share for the content producer.makeArticleAd();Let's take a look at how revenue sharing affects Snap's   financials.Image source: Snap/Author.Revenue sharing doesn't impact Snap's top lineWhile eMarketer is lowering its expectations for Snapchat, the   actual decline in net ad revenue won't show up in Snap's top   line. Snap reports gross revenue similarly to howAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) reports Google's revenue. Google   lumps in revenue from its network partners with its search and   YouTube revenue, and then accounts for revenue sharing as part of   its traffic acquisition costs.The amount of revenue Snap shares with its publisher partners   is then reported as an item in the company's cost of revenue. So,   eMarketer may have well said it expects Snap's cost of revenue to   come in $30 million higher than originally anticipated.Snap's Publisher Stories. Image source: Snap.Last year, Snap says revenue sharing payments increased $48.2   million from 2015, but it doesn't provide a specific amount it   paid to partners. That does at least provide a floor, and it's   nearly 12% of Snap's $404.5 million in total revenue last   year.For comparison, Google paid out $10.9 billion in revenue   sharing to its network partners (not including YouTube) in 2016.   That's almost 14% of its total ad revenue for the year.Revenue sharing may increase even fasterWhile most analysts expect Snap to grow its top line to around   $1 billion this year, its path to that mark may mean less of that   revenue makes it past the second line (cost of revenue) on its   income statement. Snap has inked several high-profile deals with   media companies over the last year.It already has deals in place with NBC, ABC, BBC, Turner, New   York Time, Discovery, Time, A+E Networks, and VICE to produce   original shows for Snapchat. Snap is still actively pursuing   these high-profile deals.It's important to note that Snap says its revenue-sharing   arrangements ""generally do not contain minimum financial   commitments to our publisher partners and are generally not tied   to specific events or promotions."" That seems to indicate Snap   doesn't pay anything up front for these productions, but Snap may   help out with the costs as ""content creation costs"" also show up   in management's description of cost of revenue. Content creation   costs include personnel-related costs, according to Snap's   S-1.With the growth of the Publisher Stories platform, investors   should expect a stark increase in cost of goods sold due to   revenue-sharing and content-creation costs.Cost of revenue is already under scrutinySnap posted a negative gross margin last year as its cost of   revenue overshadowed its revenue. The biggest factor behind it is   Snap's hosting expenses, for which it primarily relies on Google   Cloud. It's already committed to spending $3 billion in total on   cloud infrastructure over the next five years, which will   continue to put pressure on Snap's gross margin as it tries to   scale.Add to that the fact that one of its revenue drivers is   growing content from publisher partners, which contributes to   even more cost of revenue. While a few tens of millions of   dollars is relatively small compared to the hundreds of millions   Snap is spending with its cloud partners each year, Snap's   margins are so thin that every dollar counts.10 stocks we like better than Snap Inc.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Better Buy: Intel Corporation vs. NVIDIA;3/16/2017;"Intel(NASDAQ: INTC) andNVIDIA(NASDAQ: NVDA) are titans of the same semiconductor industry,   born a generation apart. As in all human endeavors, the only   constant in business is change, and Intel and NVIDIA find   themselves today at different stages of their corporate life   cycles.Thanks to coming adoption of technologies such as self-driving   cars and artificial-intelligence (AI) software, NVIDIA has seen   demand for its graphics chips move from a niche into the   mainstream. On the other hand, Intel roared to global dominance   during the rise of PCs and mainframe servers, but it has   struggled to tap into more recent growth markets such as mobile   computing, deep learning, and the like.So which is the better stock for you to buy today: Intel or   NVIDIA? Let's examine three different aspects for NVIDIA and   Intel to determine which companies' shares appear more attractive   today.makeArticleAd();Financial fortitudeThose same life-cycle differences reveal themselves in   assessing the financial strength of NVIDIA and Intel. Look at   these four important metrics of liquidity and solvency for both   companies.CompanyCash and InvestmentsDebtCash From OperationsCurrent RatioNVIDIA$6.8 billion$2.8 billion$1.7 billion4.7Intel$14.9 billion$25.2 billion$21.8 billion1.7Data sources: NVIDA and Intel investor relations; Yahoo!   Finance.NVIDIA easily beats Intel in terms of near-term liquidity --   as evidenced by its current ratio -- and in terms of net debt,   which is just a fancy accounting term for cash and equivalents   minus debt. That being said, Intel's cash flow-generation   capabilities are staggering. Though $18.4 billion of its debt   will mature in 2022 or later, Intel could easily erase the   majority of its leverage in a single year, even after subtracting   the $9.6 billion it spent on capital expenditures in 2016.Intel is also an example of a company that uses debt, or a   leveraged capital structure, as a source of competitive   advantage. It's one of the few semiconductor companies that also   owns its chip fabrication plants; NVIDIA outsources its fab to a   consortium of partners includingTaiwan Semiconductor,Samsung, and more. Operating large fixed assets such as   semiconductor manufacturing plants requires plenty of capital,   which explains Intel's use of ample leverage. Either way, both   companies are in fine financial shape, given their respective   strategies, so let's call this one a tie and move on.Winner: Tie.Image source: Getty Images.Durable competitive advantagesNVIDIA and Intel each enjoy meaningful competitive advantages   in their respective areas of the global semiconductor market.Sources estimate Intel controls 87% of the PC CPU market and   95% the server CPU market, although the exact numbers aren't as   important as knowing that Intel dominates the global PC and data   center microprocessor markets, and for a predictable reason:   Intel's longtime performance advantage over the competition --   namely,Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD)  -- has allowed the company to charge higher   prices per unit for its chips.Intel plows an aggressive portion of its profits back into its   research and development, which has, in turn, allowed it to   maintain the performance advantages of its chips. Barring   execution risks, which have been a concern fromtime to time, this long-standing trend has served as a virtuous cycle that   has allowed Intel to dominate its core markets and consistently   produce above-average profits for its shareholders.The dollar values involved help flesh this dynamic out a bit   more. In the past three years, AMD's revenue has totaled $4.2   billion in 2016, $3.9 billion in 2015, and $5.5 billion in   2014. In contrast, Intel's research-and-development budgetalonehas totaled $12.7 billion, $12.1 billion, and $11.5 billion over   the same period. This kind of structural advantage is   incredibly difficult to overcome.NVIDIA's competitive advantages are more technological than   structural at the moment. Because of its long-standing place as   the creator graphics computing, on which it still focuses,   NVIDIA's chips have generally been the best of breed in each of   the graphics processing applications its products serve. The   company pressed that advantage with last year's debut of its   Pascal architecture, around which it launched a number of new   chips.Better still, NVIDIA has used its advantage to help   consolidate early leads in core growth markets such as AI   computing platforms and driverless cars. In recent years, NVIDIA   has become the GPU supplier to the AI efforts atMicrosoft,Facebook,Amazon.com,Alphabet, andApple,to name a few. Much has also been made of NVIDIA's potential in   self-driving cars, where it supplies the graphics chips that   power the autonomous-vehicle efforts ofFord,Tesla,Volkswagen,Honda, and many more. Both of these industries figure to offer   substantial growth opportunities over the coming decade, and   NVIDIA's place as the go-to supplier to support these emerging   technologies speaks to their compelling value proposition.Winner: NVIDIA.ValuationThe way the market is pricing Intel and NVIDIA shares should   come as little surprise, given what we just learned about the   outlook for their businesses. Here's a snapshot of three of the   most commonly used valuation metrics for Intel and NVIDIA.CompanyP/EForward P/EEV/EBITDANVIDIA38.329.523.6Intel16.912.37.8Data source: Yahoo! Finance.Both companies also pay dividends: Intel shares currently   yield 2.9%; NVIDIA, a mere 0.5%.As for which stock appears the more attractively valued, I   think both companies appear reasonably valued, given their   respective growth outlooks. The multiple trends fueling NVIDIA's   growth should support its earnings growth for arguably a decade   or more, so its sky-high valuation shouldn't be a deterrent for   investors with a similarly long time horizon.As more of a mature company, Intel will have its investment   outlook driven by its ability to grow its EPS and return excess   capital to shareholders. Its fantastic economics should allow it   to do so, but it's hard to get excited about a company that   analysts see growing sales just 0.9% this year and 2% in   2018. So in terms of which company is more appropriately   valued, I think both companies trade near prices that seem   fair.Winner: Tie.And the winner is... NVIDIA by a noseBoth companies present interesting value propositions to   investors today. Intel offers a mix of profitability and income   at a fairly discounted price, which could prove compelling to   more conservative investors. However, many of NVIDIA's growth   markets are in their early stages, which makes it the more   attractive stock to own over the long term.10 stocks we like better than IntelWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Oracle (ORCL) Stock Spikes on Impressive Q3 Earnings and Cloud Revenues;3/16/2017;"Oracle CorporationORCLis up 7% at $45.94 per share in midday trading on Thursday after posting impressive third quarter earnings yesterday, beating both the Zacks Consensus earnings and revenues estimates.  (To learn more about Oracle's Q3 Earnings, check out this Zacks article:Oracle (ORCL) Beats on Q3 Earnings & Revenues: Stock Up)The California-based company is one of the world's leading suppliers of software for information management and is a new participant in the cloud software service, which is dominated by Amazon.comAMZN, while International Business MachinesIBM, MicrosoftMSFTand GoogleGOOGLare becoming notable competitors.Oracle on Wednesday reported cloud software revenues of $1.1 billion, up 85% compared to the same period a year ago and total revenues were $9.3 billion, up 3%. In dollars, the cloud business grew by almost $500 million year-over-year while the total revenues grew $260 million.The software company's new cloud-computing service has been offsetting the revenue decline in the company's long-time software-licensing operations. Revenues from new software licenses saw a $266 million decline, a 16% fall from a year earlier.""Both our SaaS and PaaS business are doing great, I'm even more excited about our second generation IaaS business,"" said Oracle co-founder and Chief Technology Officer, Larry Ellison. ""Our new Gen2 IaaS is both faster and lower cost than Amazon Web Services.""There is no doubt that Oracle has been investing money to ensure their products and services are in the best shape to compete against powerhouses like Amazon. The operating expenses in cloud software as a service and platform as a service went up by 25% while $4.5 billion were put into research and development for the reported quarter.Despite the impressive growth in its cloud software sector, Oracle is still nowhere near Amazon, who dominates the cloud spaceowning 40% of the cloud market share. However, in February, Oracle altered the terms of its licensing policy to double the cost of running its software in Amazon's cloud environment, reported byMarket Realist.With this move, Oracle took away one of Amazon's cloud service's main selling points, which is the cheaper route to the cloud and presented its own cloud platform as the cheaper option.Oracle reported earnings of $0.63 per share and revenues of $9.27 billion. The company's Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.19 per share of outstanding common stock, up 27% from the current quarterly dividend of $0.15.Oracle expects the fourth quarter of 2017 to be another strong quarter.

Valeant Pharmaceuticals Intl Inc (VRX) Stock: Goodbye, Not Good Buy;3/16/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSome may be tempted to declare ""capitulation!"" inValeant Pharmaceuticals Intl Inc(NYSE:VRX) as one notorious and maligned bull bids farewell. Loathing aside, heavy debt and a burdensome Valeant stock chart suggests bears, not bulls or pigs are still in control of VRX.makeArticleAd();Love him or hate him (and most arguably seem to dislike Bill Ackman), now is not the time to bet against the hedge fund manager and activist investor by picking up Valeant stock.After a very long, painful and much-publicized campaign in shares of VRX, Bill Ackman announced this past Monday night, his hedge fund Pershing Square has exited Valeant Pharmaceuticals.The investment inVRX has been more than an eyesorefor the storied hedge fund manager. Over the past two years, Valeant stock has tanked nearly 95% from the firm's initial purchase price of $190 to $11 a share. Even worse, exiting VRX required a massive liquidation of some 27 million shares. What's more, the Valeant stake represented Pershing Square's most concentrated bet and only magnified the loss, both on and off paper, for Bill Ackman.But love him or hate him, thinking his company's capitulation in Valeant stock, which admittedly required a ""disproportionately"" large amount of firm's resources, means VRX is now free to rally; think again.10 Safe Dividend Stocks to Own During the Next Market CrashThe fact of the matter is Pershing Square decision only came after a substantial year-long commitment to help Valeant sell key assets, establish a new management team and overhaul of the company's board. As well and despite those efforts, there remains $30 billion in under-funded debt obligations.Bottom line, if a storied hedge fund with an otherwise very enviable record of success over the past couple decades can't justify staying the course, though they do have to answer to their dwindling investment base; it's time to face the truth of an equally problematic chart in Valeant stock.Valeant Stock Daily ChartLooking at the daily chart of VRX and it's obvious, to us at least, there have been occasions over the past year where Valeant shares deserved the benefit of the doubt - and even offered decent size, short-term trading profits to bulls.At this point in time though, and without being too pessimistic, it would be hard to defend VRX stock. On a technical basis this week's latest tumble put shares at multiyear lows and pointed towards the financial crisis low of $6.65 - and to be quite honest, maybe much lower in 2017.VRX Stock Bearish Combo SpreadIn reviewing the VRX options board and with shares at $10.96, I like the idea of creating a bearish modified spread. One combo of interest is selling the April $11/$12.50 call vertical and purchasing the April $10 put for even money.If Valeant stock disappoints this bearish trader, the worst case scenario is a loss of $1.50 above $12.50 at expiration. That would require a complete reversal of this week's bearish gap.How to Make Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Pay You High YieldLooking optimistically lower on the price chart, if VRX shares remain wedged between $10 and below $11 a share at expiration, both parts of the combo go out worthless and the trader breaks even. However, an interim move towards the held put could produce paper profits. The position does maintain a bearish delta, or directional bias, when there's still time on the calendar prior to expiration.Lastly, if VRX stock dropped below $10, the combination would begin to trade just like short stock, but without the open-ended risk of that type of position. If that were to happen, I'd look to close the bear call spread and sell a portion of the long put inventory for even money. That adjustment would allow the trader to safely maintain the balance of his or her bearish long put position with no risk.Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in any of the securities or their derivatives mentioned in this article.

Better Buy: Facebook, Inc. vs. Line Corp.;3/16/2017;"They were the largest tech IPOs in the respective years they   went public. They compete head-to-head in what many expect to   emerge as an increasingly important area of consumer tech in   coming years. They're social-media powerhouseFacebook(NASDAQ: FB) and messaging platformLine Corporation(NYSE: LN) .Line made its public debut last July, so the sample size   of its trading history is minuscule. However, in the months since   its IPO, the respective fortunes of Line and Facebook have   diverged to a meaningful degree.makeArticleAd();LNdata byYChartsOf course, this only tells any investor a fraction of what he   or she needs to know. Let's examine three important aspects of   Facebook's and Line's investment narratives, to figure out which   stock is the better buy today.Financial fortitudeThe comparison of financial might between Line and Facebook is   an instance of David versus Goliath. Look at these four important   measures of solvency and liquidity for both companies:CompanyCash and InvestmentsDebtCash From OperationsCurrent RatioFacebook$29.4 billion$0$16.1 billion11.9Line Corp$1.2 billion$0$253.4 billion2.0Data sources: Facebook and Line Corp. investor   relations, Yahoo!

However, the   winner here was inevitable.Winner: Facebook.Image source: Getty Images.Durable competitive advantagesThe size contrast between Facebook and Line continues in   examining their durable competitive advantages.As of its most recent earnings report, Facebook counted 1.86   billion monthly active users (MAUs) on its core social-networking   platform, or about 58% of the world's population that has access   to the internet. Beyond this, Facebook owns other   social-media platforms and messaging services, such as Instagram   (600 million MAUs), Facebook Messenger (1 billion   MAUs), and WhatsApp (1 billion MAUs), that are seeing   large and growing user counts as well. This immense base of users   has allowed Facebook to create the most powerful digital   advertising this side ofAlphabet. Better still, Facebook is moving into emerging areas of   technology, including virtual reality, artificial intelligence,   live digital video streaming, and much more. Facebook, in short,   has quickly ascended to become one of the most important   technology companies on the face of the earth.Line, on the other hand, is far smaller. As of its most recent   earnings report, the company counted 217 million monthly active   users on its messaging platform, though 76% of its users are   concentrated in just four core markets: Japan, Thailand, Taiwan,   and Indonesia. Worse, its user growth declined sequentially from   220 million in its Q3 report, suggesting that Line may be   feeling pressure from larger global messaging platforms -- like   the ones Facebook owns. The company has moved aggressively to   monetize its users through products such as paid stickers, games,   and a host of other mobile apps, but the jury remains out on   whether Line can translate its regional strength in messaging   into a sustainable long-term business. Compared with Facebook,   it's clear which company enjoys more substantial durable   competitive advantages.Winner: Facebook.ValuationA meaningful gap exists between Facebook's and Line's   valuations, and for good reason. First, look at three of the most   commonly used valuation metrics for both companies:CompanyP/EForward P/EEV/EBITDAFacebook39.120.424.7Line Corp.111.834.634.3Data source: Yahoo! Finance.Again, Facebook beats Line across all three valuation   statistics. Comparing this performance to their projected future   growth rates, analysts estimate that Facebook's earnings per   share will grow at an average annual rate of 23.5% over the next   five years, versus 39.3% for Line -- which has only one sell-side   analyst covering its stock at the moment. I think the key   question here is to what extent investors believe in Line's   monetization capabilities. If Line can indeed grow its EPS at   such above-average rates, Line shares could do quite well.   However, the cracks that have emerged in its user growth story   give me pause. So let's call this section a draw and move on.Winner: Tie.And the winner is... FacebookFacebook remains undeniably stronger than Line, even factoring   in Line's higher estimated future growth rates. The Asian   messaging platform still has plenty of questions to answer about   whether it can continue to expand its uses. On the other hand,   Facebook is one of the most powerful and iconic companies in all   of tech. It stands as the better buy between the two today.10 stocks we like better than FacebookWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

How to Make Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Pay You High Yield;3/16/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe Nasdaq-100 is posting new highs, and it's being led higher by companies likeAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL). To most traders, though, it would seem like it's too late to initiate a long position in GOOGL stock by purchasing shares at $870.makeArticleAd();Luckily, you and I have the options markets.With GOOGL options, we can design trades that allow for a margin of error. That would give us a lot more confidence going forward; otherwise, our stops would kick in on the first few red days.Less than 30 days ago, I shared atrade that was designed to be a sure thing. Almost $4 per contract in profits came fast. Today, with those profits in my pocket, I want to ""range trade"" Alphabet stock instead. We could all use a little speculative risk in our portfolio.The short story of Alphabet is that fundamentally it's as solid as it gets. It's the king of search, and that's a cash cow that just keeps getting fatter. So with a trailing price-to-earnings ratio of 30, GOOGL's potential is built in somewhat … but I think it's not fully built in. I think what people are forgetting is that Alphabet can still monetize the billions of users on the Android OS much better than it already is.Click to EnlargeTechnically speaking, Alphabet stock is at all-time highs, but still has room to run. I'd just expect some resistance first.How GoPro Inc (GPRO) Stock Could Stage a ComebackFor now, then, this is what we'll do.How to Trade GOOGL StockThe bullish side:Sell the GOOGL 13 Apr $845/$842.5 credit put spread for 40 cents per contract. We have an 80% chance that price will stay above my strike where we need it.The bearish side:Sell the GOOGL 13 Apr $887.5/$890 credit call spread for an additional 60 cents per contract. Here, given the upside potential in markets, our chances of success are around 75%.Taking both trades would constitute a sold iron condor for a total $1 in credit. Since we can only lose on one side or the other, our max risk drops, thereby raising my potential yield above 60% on risk. This trade's delta is much higher than my usual points of entry, and that's what makes it a speculative setup in GOOGL stock.In this market, I know we'll need to tightly manage this iron condor. So we shouldn't risk more money than we can afford to lose.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director ofSellSpreads.com.

An Uber IPO Will Be a Down Round;3/16/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAmong venture capitalists a ""down round"" is defined as funding in a private company that carries a lower valuation than the previous investment.makeArticleAd();It means a company's investors are taking a loss. That's what is likely to happen whenUbergoes public.Right now,Uber is said to be worth $69 billionafter taking losses of $2.2 billion during the first nine months of 2016. Its 2016 revenues were estimated at $5.5 billion, and it is not unusual for fast-growing companies to sustain losses as they invest to keep the growth going.Valuing a company at 12.5 times revenue when it seems to be at the peak of its performance may seem to make sense for wealthy Silicon Valley investors, but here in the real world, we have a word for that kind of offer, and the word is no.Trouble Ahead, Trouble Behind for UberUber drivers are not employees. They are, in theory, business partners who pay Uber a commission to bring them work driving people around.They are unlicensed taxi driverswho don't pay for medallions and are thus subject to harassment by the government.10 Safe Dividend Stocks to Own During the Next Market CrashBut the Uber drivers I have met are incredibly professional, and their cars are clean, thanks in part to a""Vehicle Solutions""program that lets them rent, lease or buy new or nearly new cars. This is how the company has grown.But relying on contractors carriesrisks. Uber is said to have a""toxic""work culture,one rife with sexual abuse, leading to aTwitter Inc(NYSE:TWTR) campaign advocating thatcustomers delete the app.CEO Travis Kalanick described his corporate culture as""baller,""and once joked to a magazine thatcalling the company ""Boober""was fine because it got him sex.Pando Dailyfounder Sarah Lacy has beenan especially harsh critic, and political polarization now seems to be having an effect, as rivalLyfthas reportedly grown7%in just the last two months, although both companies have seenless traffic lately.Self-Driving MessFor investors, Uber's biggest risk may lie in its efforts to get into the self-driving car business.Alphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG), the parent of Google andWaymo, a self-driving car pioneer, has filed a legal complaint charging thatUber stole Waymo's trade secretsby having an employee walk out with them, founding a company called Otto, then buying Otto for $700 million. If Alphabet wins the case, it could take Uber completely out of that business.Uber is also challenging Google Maps,pushing its own system on drivers, one that will make their driving fit corporate needs. It also gives the company a direct online connection to drivers.Uber's fraught relations with competitors, drivers and government is nowa global phenomenon. Competition from new entrants is also increasing, even in Africa.The Bottom LineBuying Uber stock is based on a belief that the company will grow, but it's more likely that Uber is now at the replacement end of the curve, where growth slows down.Buying Uber in hopes of getting into the self-driving ""cars as a service"" craze is also risky, because Uber's ownership of the necessary intellectual property is under question.Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Is Flying High, But Don't Go Contrarian Yet!The risk of venture capitalists holding companies through their period of maximum growth is always that they will hold on too long, that they will be unable to exit the investment on their own timetable - that they will, in the end, get too greedy.That's what has happened here. When Uber goes public, wait for all lock-up periods to expire before considering an investment. See what its full value is before you buy. Don't bet on the hype of the IPO.

Google Home Is Catching Up to Amazon's Echo;3/16/2017;"Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) had a surprise hit on its hand with the Echo smart   speaker. After releasing it exclusively to Prime members in late   2014, the device proved so popular that Amazon was able to   quickly open orders to everyone in the U.S. by the following   summer. On Christmas Eve of 2015, the Echo was one of the top   five items ordered, according to Amazon's annual holiday press   release. Last year, Echo device sales climbed nine times compared   to 2015's holiday season.That's despite the November introduction of Google Home, a   competing smart speaker from theAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) subsidiary. During Alphabet's   fourth-quarter earnings call, RBC analyst Mark Mahaney suggested   Echo devices, powered by the virtual assistant Alexa, outsold   Google Home 10-to-1 in the quarter.But Mahaney is changing his tune after conducting a more   in-depth survey. ""Home's awareness and installed base could be   much closer to Alexa -- with a brand awareness in the U.S. 80%   that of Alexa and an installed base that may be close to a third   that of Alexa,"" he recently wrote in a note.makeArticleAd();It looks like Google Home is quickly catching up to Amazon's   Echo.Image source: Google.Google plans to keep investing in Google HomeGoogle plans to keep making Google Home a better device by   improving its search capabilities and functionality. ""We are   going to invest a lot in it over 2017,"" Google CEO Sundar Pichai   told investors on Alphabet's fourth-quarter earnings call. ""I   think there is a lot of work ahead to make all of this work well   for users. And this is the core area where we've invested in for   the very long term,"" he added.Google intends to leverage its massive Android platform to   continue improving Google Assistant, the artificial intelligence   (AI) behind Google Home. At least 200 million devices will have   access to the voice assistant, which will provide Google with a   lot more opportunities to learn exactly what people are looking   for when they say, ""OK, Google.""Google will also have to improve Google Home's capabilities.   The device currently has around 80 Actions, which is nothing   compared to the 10,000-plus functionalities available with Alexa.   To that end, Google launched the Actions on Google developer kit   in December.Strategy Analytics estimates Google will sell 1 million Google   Home devices by midyear. That still trails Amazon's sales by a   significant margin. The research group estimates Amazon sold 6.3   million Echo devices last year, and that should go up   meaningfully in 2017. Mahaney estimates Amazon will sell 60   million Echo devices by 2020, bringing the install base to 128   million.Google still doesn't know how to monetize voice searchWhile Google Home sales are improving relative to Amazon Echo,   it's not clear device sales will follow a similar path. Google   Home lacks one of the key functionalities of Amazon's devices:   the ability to easily shop on Amazon.Seventeen percent of Echo owners use Alexa to place orders on   Amazon, according to Mahaney's survey. As the number of devices   in use grows, Mahaney expects the amount of shopping done via   Alexa on Amazon to grow as well. By 2020, sales through the voice   assistant could reach $5 billion, according to the analyst's   estimate.Google doesn't even have a business model for monetizing   Google Home beyond hardware sales. Search and display ads don't   work very well on a device with no display.Moreover, Google doesn't offer a compelling differentiating   factor for consumers to pick its device over another smart   speaker. Comparatively, Amazon Prime members, of which there'sa rapidly growing number, have lots of reasons to pick the Echo, like easy access to   ordering things on Amazon or inexpensive use of Amazon Music   Unlimited.As such, Amazon is poised to win the long-term competition   even if Google Home is catching up in the short term.10 stocks we like better than AlphabetWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actuals and estimates for the current and following periods,please click here>>>The Q1 earnings season will follow a strong showing in the preceding reporting cycle, with growth reaching its highest level in two years and the overall quarterly earnings tally reaching a new quarterly record. The market will be looking for continuation of these favorable trends in the Q1 reporting cycle as well, which has (officially) gotten underway already but wouldn't be in the spotlight for another four weeks.Total Q1 earnings are expected to be up +6.4% from the same period last year on +6.5% higher revenues. This would follow +7.1% earnings growth in 2016 Q4 on +4.4% top-line gains, the highest growth pace in two years.Estimates for Q1 came down as the quarter unfolded, with the current +6.4% growth down from +10.4% at the end of December.Please note that while Q1 estimates have followed a well traversed path that we have been seeing consistently over the last few years, the magnitude of negative revisions compares favorably to other periods. In other words, Q1 estimates have come down, but they haven't come down by as much.At the sector level, ten of the 16 Zacks sectors are expected to earn more relative to the year-earlier period, with earnings growth for the Technology sector expected to be up +10.2% from the same period last year. The sector is expecting strong earnings growth despite the relatively flattish expectation fromApple(NASDAQ:AAPL-Free Report). Strong growth atAlphabet(NASDAQ:GOOGL-Free Report),Facebook(NASDAQ:FB-Free Report) and easy comparisons atMicron(NASDAQ:MU-Free Report) are the big positive contributors to the sector.

Twitter's (TWTR) Prominent Accounts Hacked, Shares Fall;3/16/2017;"makeZacksArticleAd();Reportedly,Twitter IncTWTRwas in for a rude shock after some of its high profile accounts were hacked and used to post tweets in favor of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Shares went down nearly 2% to $15.03 yesterday.Per reports, the accounts were not hacked from the main platform but from Twitter Counter, an Amsterdam based third party statistics service for Twitter. Some of the prominent accounts hacked included pop sensation Justin Bieber's Japan account, BBC North America, Reuters Japan, Forbes, UNICEF, Duke University, Amnesty International and Starbucks Argentina. Tweets filled with swastika (Nazi symbol) and hashtags like ""NaziGermany"" and ""NaziHolland"" were sent from these compromised accounts.Currently, it is uncertain as to who carried out this mass hacking.Turkey/Netherlands Face-offPer media reports, Turkey and Netherlands are embroiled in a political spat ever since the latter barred Turkish ministers from attending a political rally in the country ahead of a referendum in Turkey. The rally was organized to gain support for Erdogan. Turkey is drawing up a new constitution that will significantly enhance the President's power and make the post of prime minister and vice president redundant. The referendum is scheduled to take place on Apr 16.Following the treatment meted out to its ministers, Turkey has ""suspended high level ties"" with Netherlands as well as barred the Dutch ambassador from returning to Ankara. It has also labeled Dutch action as ""Nazi tactics"".Twitter, Inc. PriceTwitter, Inc. Price|Twitter, Inc. QuoteTwitter's Trolling Trouble & MoreAnalysts observe that this incident is unlikely to cause much damage to Twitter but the increase in these types of occurrences (hacking, fake news & hate speech) can prove detrimental.  Social media sites have come under tremendous scrutiny following the U.S presidential elections in 2016. FacebookFBand Twitter were accused of disseminating fake news resulting in surprising election results.Rising concerns have also come from Germany as the Social Democrat Party, reportedly, said it will fine social media companies 50 million euros ($53 million) for their inability to contain a hoax.  Since the beginning of the year, German intelligence agencies have been on their toes as there are chances that fake news will alter election results. Reportedly, Buzzfeed has found that there are several fake reports on Facebook about Angela Merkel, who is campaigning for the fourth term as the chancellor.Twitter has been trying to contain the trolling menace that has plagued its platform for long now and possibly kept potential users as well as buyers at bay.Apart from taking down accounts of offenders, Twitter also announced several measures to combat trolling. The company has improvised the ""mute"" button, which will enable users to block tweets that include objectionable words, phrases and conversations. Plus, it has empowered users by giving them a ""more direct way of reporting"" hateful conduct. Twitter users can now report any hateful conduct that they come across on the platform. Per Twitter, this ""helps reduce the burden on the person experiencing the abuse, and helps to strengthen a culture of collective support on Twitter."" The company said that it is also ""retraining"" its staff to better tackle abusive behavior on the platform.Twitter cannot afford more troubles as it passes through one of the toughest phases in its corporate history. User growth is sluggish and advertising revenues are decelerating. Amid this entire fracas, the exodus of high profile executives continues. In the past one year, Twitter shares declined 10.18%, as against 8.57% rise in the ZacksInternet Softwareindustry. Its CEO, Jack Dorsey's focus on ""live"" and user friendly changes hasn't yet moved the needle for Twitter.To top it, the widely expected takeover didn't materialize, with interested parties like AlphabetGOOGL, Salesforce and The Walt Disney CompanyDISpulling out last minute, given the challenges that Twitter faces alongside trolling.At present, Twitter carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Sound The Alarm, ALRM is Headed Higher;3/15/2017;"makeZacksArticleAd();Get ready for some upward revisions to the earnings estimates ofAlarm.com( ALRM).  The stock is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now but reported earnings after the close on Wednesday, March 15.  The company posted revenues of $69.79M compared to the consensus of $63.95M.  EPS of $0.19 was $0.06 better than the Wall Street consensus estimate.In the release, the company guided Wall Street higher.  FY2017 is now expected to produce revenue of between $322M to $325.5M and that is comfortably higher than the $300M consensus estimate.  The company expects to earn $0.73 to $0.75 for the year and that is also above the $0.65 consensus estimate.In late after hours trading, I see the stock at $33.39 up $2.76 or about 9%.Estimates Likely Moving HigherWhen a company raises guidance over the consensus you can expect the analysts to adjust their models.  These models help them derive their earnings estimates which are used in the Zacks Rank.  Since there haven't been any earnings revisions over the last 60 days, ALRM is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).  In the coming days I anticipate the stock to see several upward revisions which should help boost the Zacks Rank for this stock to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) or a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).AcquisitionsALRM made a few recent acquisitions and they were touched on during the conference call.  During the call, management talked about how the ObjectVideo acquisition will allow customers to track cars and license plates or even customers in a store.The Icontrol Networks deal closed in the quarter and the company mentioned how the Piper unit powers a portion of the ADT platform.  The industry had been viewed as ""we versus ADT"" but that has changed with the advent of customer home protection services offered by cable companies.An analyst questioned if the company was looking to a product offering around cars, and while the company would not commit on a specific answer, it was clear that it could be something coming down the road.  Many times during the call management noted that they were maintaining a healthy level of spending for R&D.  Having an expandable platform is key because the security business has been changing very rapidly.Follow Brian Bolan on Twitter @BBolan1OutlookAs we think about the changes in home security, it is clear that people are adding devices and services thanks to the relative ease of the internet.  Management noted on the call that people want these products and services to come from one source.As an example, I have a Google Cam (formerly Dropcam) and while it is accessible via its own app I would like to see it be usable via my Amazon echo.  Yes the Google Nest is controllable via the voice recognizing tool, but I would like more functionality.  I often search on Amazon for devices that are compatible with Alexa since I have power out that is controlled by another company.  It too has its own app and with only a few devices having multiple apps is already a pressure point for me.With the strong revenue guidance, management believes that its products and services will be well received by customers.Analysts Notes ComingAs I look at where most recommendations are, I see a few potential upgrades tomorrow.  Goldman Sachs started coverage of the stock with a Neutral rating on January 31 and a $31 price target. The analyst for the firm asked about the potential for organic growth from Icontrol which allowed management to talk about how they were going to hold their cost structure constant and could expect about $66M in EBITDA which translates to better than 20% margin.  It is possible that Goldman Sachs ups the stock to ""Buy"" tomorrow.Raymond James downgraded the stock back on August 16 as the moved their rating to Market Perform from Outperform.  Imperial Capital has the stock as ""In-line"" with a $30 price target.Roth Capital started coverage on October 3 with a buy and a $33.50 price target.  Don't be surprised to see that price target moved to $37.50 range.Maxim Group initiated with a buy rating and $37 price target on December 1.  They are clearly the most bullish on the stock and for good reason.  I would look for the Maxim price target to expand to $40 or more given the recently posted results.Trading Range?The stock has a 52 week high of $34.43, but don't be too surprised to see a new level reached tomorrow.  Why do I say this?  Well back on October 31, 2016 some unusual call buying was spotted in ALRM.  The call was a $35 strike with a March expiration.  At the time, the stock was $29 and change so it was a pretty big reach.  I see those same calls closing at $0.17 with open interest of 856 - so not anything to get too excited about.What did catch my eye on the option chain was all the puts that moved the day of earnings.  The 27.5 strike that expires on Friday saw 729 contracts vs open interest of 898.  Check that open interest level tomorrow to see if those were all premium sellers as the put was paying $0.42.I like the chances of several price target increases coming tomorrow.  There is an outside chance we get an upgrade on the stock as well.  Throw in the idea that some mildly aggressive calls were bought several months ago I and I like the chances of this stock trading over $35 on March 16 or soon thereafter.

You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actuals and estimates for the current and following periods,please click here>>>The Q1 earnings season will follow a strong showing in the preceding reporting cycle, with growth reaching its highest level in two years and the overall quarterly earnings tally reaching a new quarterly record. The market will be looking for continuation of these favorable trends in the Q1 reporting cycle as well, which has (officially) gotten underway already but wouldn't be in the spotlight for another four weeks.Total Q1 earnings are expected to be up +6.4% from the same period last year on +6.5% higher revenues. This would follow +7.1% earnings growth in 2016 Q4 on +4.4% top-line gains, the highest growth pace in two years.Estimates for Q1 came down as the quarter unfolded, with the current +6.4% growth down from +10.4% at the end of December. The chart below shows how Q1 earnings growth expectations have evolved over the last three months.Please note that while Q1 estimates have followed a well traversed path that we have been seeing consistently over the last few years, the magnitude of negative revisions compares favorably to other periods. In other words, Q1 estimates have come down, but they haven't come down by as much.At the sector level, ten of the 16 Zacks sectors are expected to earn more relative to the year-earlier period, with earnings growth for the Technology sector expected to be up +10.2% from the same period last year. The sector is expecting strong earnings growth despite the relatively flattish expectation fromApple(AAPL). Strong growth atAlphabet(GOOGL),Facebook(FB) and easy comparisons atMicron(MU) are the big positive contributors to the sector.

Twitter, Inc. Is Missing Out on This Major Catalyst;3/15/2017;"Twitter(NYSE:TWTR) has undoubtedly missed the mark recently. Last year, the social   network's sequential monthly active user growth stalled and even   temporarily turned negative. Meanwhile, Twitter's revenue growth   rates have decelerated rapidly and its stock price has plummeted   nearly 70% in two years.Going further, there isn't a clear end in sight to Twitter's   revenue challenges. A new report by research company eMarketer   (viaRecode) forecasts Twitter's U.S. mobile ad revenue will actually   decline in 2017 compared to 2016 asFacebook(NASDAQ: FB) andAlphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google gobble up marketers'   rising spending on mobile advertisements.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();Twitter's missed opportunityIn 2017, Twitter's U.S. mobile advertising revenue will   decline from $1.21 billion last year to $1.15 billion, eMarketer   estimates. A quick glance at Twitter's financials in the   company's most recent quarter suggests this estimate is   realistic. Twitter's $382 million in U.S. advertising revenue in   Q4 was down 7% from the year-ago period. And given that 89% of   Twitter's global ad revenue during the quarter came from mobile,   it's safe to say that Twitter's mobile ad revenue in the U.S.   probably isn't faring too well.What's unfortunate about Twitter's struggling mobile ad   business in the U.S. is that it's happening at a time when   marketers are spending more on mobile ads. Total mobile ad spend   in the U.S. is expected to increase 25% in 2017 compared to 2016,   eMarketer estimates.Unlike Twitter, advertising juggernauts Google and Facebook   are well-positioned to snap-up this incremental spending. The two   companies' combined share of U.S. mobile ad spend will increase   from 54% in 2016 to 57% in 2017, eMarketer estimates. But   eMarketer estimates that Twitter's share of U.S. mobile   advertising revenue will decline from 2.6% in 2016 to 2% in   2017.Twitter management likely agrees that it won't be keeping up   with Google's or Facebook's growth rate in 2017. In the company's   fourth-quarter shareholder letter, management said, ""escalating   competition for digital ad spending"" could present challenges for   advertising revenue growth in 2017.Image source: Twitter.Can Twitter reinvigorate growth?Looking further into the future -- perhaps toward the end of   2017 and into 2018 -- Twitter's domestic advertising revenue   could start growing again. Management believes that the company's   recentreaccelerationin user growth will drive revenue growth. But it's going to take   time as management expects ""advertising revenue growth to   continue to lag that of audience growth in 2017,"" the company   explained in its fourth-quarter shareholder letter.But if Twitter does return to mobile ad growth in the U.S.   toward the end of the year or in 2018, don't expect growth rates   to be very high. Not only may overall growth in U.S.-based mobile   ad spend be much slower by then, but Twitter's anemic 3%   year-over-year growth in U.S. monthly active users during the   company's most recent quarter -- notably below Facebook's 5.5%   year-over-year growth in U.S. monthly active users in the same   period -- suggests the user growth won't be much help for Twitter   in driving domestic ad revenue growth.10 stocks we like better than TwitterWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock       tip, it can pay to listen.

Genpact (G) Acquires Rage Frameworks to Boost AI Offerings;3/15/2017;"Genpact LimitedGrecently announced plans to acquire Rage Frameworks, a Dedham-based artificial intelligence (AI) startup. The acquisition is expected to boost its AI technology platform targeting enterprises. However, the terms of the deal were not disclosed.We note that the two companies have partnered many times in the past to cater to clients in the financial services and insurance sectors.With this acquisition, Genpact will be able to provide AI offerings across industries such as consumer packaged goods, industrial engineering, life-sciences and high-tech.Genpact Limited Price and ConsensusGenpact Limited Price and Consensus|Genpact Limited QuoteWhy this Move?As per an IDC report, worldwide spending on cognitive systems and AI is estimated to go past $47 billion by 2020 at a CAGR of 55.1%. Given the huge scope the segment has to offer, it is not surprising to see a number of companies flocking to the scene.Apart from IBM'sIBMWatson, Google'sGOOGLDeep Mind, Microsoft'sMSFTCortana and Apple's Siri, there are some rookies in the industry too such as AIBrain, Anki and Entefy that are trying to carve a niche in the segment.With this acquisition, we expect Genpact to better position itself in the enterprise AI space, resulting in greater adoption for its services. Also, the company's thorough domain expertise is a positive, helping it to generate enhanced actionable insights for enterprises.Moreover, Rage Frameworks has a commendable portfolio of 20 ""intelligent machines"", which can streamline an enterprise's business processes such as contract reviews and supply chain cost audits. These will help Genpact to offer customized solutions.Stock Performance OverviewShares of Genpact have largely underperformed the ZacksOutsourcingindustry over the last one year. While the industry gained a modest 14.5%, the stock declined 8.3%. The underperformance of the stock could be due to rising labor costs and a competitive landscape.Zacks RankCurrently, Genpact carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.Click here to find out which 9 other ETFs had   notable inflows »"

Snap Inc's (SNAP) Revenue Forecast Slashed, Shares Fall;3/15/2017;"As per research firm, eMarketer,Snap Inc.'sSNAPad revenues for the current year are projected to be $770 million, $30 million less than the earlier estimate (Sep 2016), due to ""higher-than-estimated revenue sharing with partners."" Despite the slash, revenues are still expected to be up 157.8% from last year.Following the news, Snap shares were down 2.4% in the session before closing at $20.58. Though Snap had a spectacular debut, rising 44% on the first day of trading, it has not been able to keep up the momentum. In the last few days, shares fell below its IPO price amid bearish reports by analysts.Citing instances of TwitterTWTRand many others, analysts believe that Snap ""will follow a pattern of hot, then cooling, tech IPOs.""They argue that Snap has already started seeing its average daily user growth rate slow down.  Plus, it is yet to make profits. Though the company's revenues are on the rise, losses are ballooning. Per reports, in 2016, Snap's revenues of $404.5 million were nearly six times higher than 2015 revenues but net loss for the year increased 38% to $514.6 million.Moreover, since Snapchat has just one source of revenues i.e., advertising, which only began in Oct 2016, it may be a concern for investors.

QuoteOther Snippets from the ReportIn its report, eMarketer further added that U.S digital ad spending will grow 15.9% to $83 billion with Alphabet'sGOOGLGoogle accounting for 40.7% of the ad revenues. Also, Google will lead search market revenues with 78% share of the domestic search ad revenues. For the year, Google's search revenues are expected to be up 16% to $28.55 billion.On the other hand, Facebook's share of the total U.S ad digital spend will be much less than that of Google. However, Facebook continues to net the biggest domestic revenue share of the display business. In 2017, Facebook's display business will likely grow 32.1% to $16.33 billion, representing 39.1% of the total display market. Instagram has emerged as an important cash cow and will contribute 20% of Facebook's U.S. mobile revenue as against 15% reported last year.While Snapchat is still a very small player with just 1.3% revenue share of the total domestic mobile ad market expected this year, the same is expected to grow to 2.7% in 2019, per eMarketer.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric   Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

4 Stocks That Can Rival Intel in the Driverless Car Market;3/15/2017;"Intel Corp'sINTCrecently announced plan to acquire Israel-based Mobileye will improve its competitive position in the fast growing driverless car market. The $15 billion deal, which many analysts believe is steep as Intel is paying a whopping 34% premium, will aid the company seize a portion of the market estimated to be worth $25 billion annually by 2025, as per consulting firm Bain & Company.makeArticleAd();According to Boston Consulting Group estimates, the autonomous car market will be worth $42 billion by 2025 and $77 billion by 2035. Per market research firm IHS, autonomous car sales will hit 21 million by 2035, growing at a CAGR of 43% over 2025-2035 time frame. In the U.S. the figure is anticipated to be 4.5 million autonomous vehicles by 2035.The massive growth prospect of the self-driving car market has not only lured semiconductor companies like Intel, QualcommQCOMand NVIDIANVDAbut also hardcore technology companies like AlphabetGOOGLand AppleAAPLto foray into the market. Cab-aggregators Uber, Lyft, search-engine Baidu, Microsoft as well as auto-makers General Motors, Ford and Volkswagen are prominent names flocking to capitalize on this highly lucrative opportunity.The robust growth in number of autonomous vehicles deployed in streets will surely escalate demand for sensor technology and auto components (chips, electronic circuits, algorithms) that support advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), the basic building block for self-driving cars. This is a significant boost for semiconductor companies.As per J.P. Morgan, the estimated total available market for semiconductors used in semiautonomous and fully autonomous cars will reach about $7.3 billion by 2025, a CAGR of approximately 62.5% starting in 2017.Moreover, the massive data generated by these autonomous vehicles related to road conditions, accident prone zones, location mapping, weather report, as well as user preferences during the driving (privacy issues notwithstanding) will actually be a much prized resource for companies, which they can monetize later.How Mobileye Benefits Intel?The driverless market is lucrative for Intel as it faces declining growth in core PC and data center markets. The latest acquisition will help Intel to rapidly penetrate the ADAS market. (Read More:Intel to Expand in Automated Car Space with Stake in HERE)We note that Intel a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, has underperformed the ZacksSemiconductor Generalindustry, in the last one year. While the stock has gained 11%, the industry witnessed an increase of 44.5% over the same time frame.Currently, Mobileye's sensor technology is used by a number of automakers like General Motors, Audi, BMW and Ford. Intel will definitely benefit from these partnerships with the leading automakers.In Jul, 2016, the company along with Mobileye and BMW announced a collaboration to manufacture self-driving cars for streets by 2021. The companies plan to put a fleet of 40 self-driving BMW cars on the street by the end of 2017. It has also signed partnership deal with Delphi Automotive.Competition Heats Up: 4 RivalsAlthough the acquisition gives Intel a slight edge, we believe that NVIDIA, Alphabet, Qualcomm, and Apple are close on heels:NVIDIA- A Zacks Rank #3 stock, NVIDIA's approach is more focused on the artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning part of the driverless market. The company's powerful graphic processor units (GPUs) are supporting the endeavors.NVIDIA's collaborations with HERE (Intel has a stake in this company) and ZENRIN expand the Live Map capabilities of autonomous vehicles. The company's collaboration with Honda, Tesla Motors, Audi, Volvo, Mercedes-Benz and BMW makes it a formidable force in the driverless car market. (Read More:NVIDIA or Intel: Which Is Better for Driverless Car Investors?)Moreover, the upcoming third generation Xavier supercomputer chip leverages NVIDIA's position in the driverless car market going ahead. (Read More:Will NVIDIA Stock Benefit from Intel's Acquisition of Mobileye?)Alphabet- This Zacks Rank #3 stock was really the primary aggressor among the technology companies in the driverless car market. Alphabet, then Google, unveiled the first fully operational driverless car way back in 2010. The recently created Waymo now primarily focuses on developing the applications and technology that drive these cars, whether for ride-sharing or personal use. (Read More:Google Finds 'Waze' to Build Self-Driving Technology)Alphabet has also partnered with Fiat Chrysler under which Google will incorporate its self-driving technology into 100 Chrysler Pacifica minivans to be used as test vehicles. Separately, Google and Ford Motor have partnered to lead a coalition of companies that will push for federal approval of autonomous cars in the near future.We also believe that Alphabet's expertise in data collecting, storing and monetizing makes it a formidable opponent of Intel in the autonomous driving market.Qualcomm- Another Zacks Rank #3 stock, the company's partnership with the likes of OnStar and TomTom are helping it to penetrate the driverless car market. Qualcomm's drive data platform ""is designed to intelligently collect and analyze information from a vehicle's sensors."" The company has partnered with Volkswagen for current and future autonomous driving vehicles.Moreover, the acquisition of NXP Semiconductors will boost Qualcomm's presence in the connectivity market. (Read More:Qualcomm Moves Closer to Acquiring NXP Semiconductors)Apple- Perhaps the most secretive challenger, the iPhone-maker has acknowledged its interest in autonomous driving. The company has been investing heavily in machine learning and automation. For years, the company has been rumored to work on self-driving Project Titan and has also hired executives from Tesla Motors and other automakers. The company carries a Zacks Rank #3.

Should You Buy Twilio Inc (TWLO) Stock? 3 Pros, 3 Cons;3/15/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe deflation of theTwilio Inc(NYSE:TWLO) IPO has certainly been stunning. The company pulled off its offering in June at $15 a share and within a few months, the price hit a nose-bleed $69. But then there was an avalanche of selling with Twilio stock. As of now, the price is at $31.makeArticleAd();Source:Web Summit Via FlickrDespite all this, TWLO has continued to grow at a rapid pace. In the latestquarter, the revenues jumped by 60% to $82 million, as the number of active customer accounts went from 34,457 to 36,606.In fact, Twilio beat the Street consensus. The company also forecasted that the growth ramp would continue throughout the year.But it was not enough to get TWLO stock back into gear. For the most part, Twilio stock has been trading in a tight range.So might there be an opportunity? Perhaps TWLO stock has bottomed out and is poised for a move on the upside? Well, to see, let's take a look at three pros and three cons:Three Pros to Twilio StockPowerful Platform: TWLO has a suite of powerful cloud-based applications, allowing for SMS, chat, voice calling and video. A developer can easily embed this technology into an app, providing access to a sophisticated communications network.7 High-Yield Dividend Stocks That Are Actually SafeThe business model is also enticing. That is, payments are only required when there is usage of the Twilio service.As a result, the company has been able to quickly attract developers. Note that there are over 1 million accounts.Going Upmarket: TWLO has an Enterprise Plan, which is focused on large customers that have tough requirements for compliance, security and administration. A key part of this was the recent granting of ISO 27001 certification, which is a global standard for security.While still in the early stages, the Enterprise Plan is showing encouraging results. For example, in the latest quarter TWLO snagged a major airline as well asCapital One Financial Corp. (NYSE:COF) and the Blue Cross Blue Shield companies.According to CEO Jeff Lawson, on the most recentearnings call: ""We are seeing really good response in terms of the enterprise. Again, I would say this is our developer first model at play where developers are the ones bringing Twilio into the enterprise just like they've brought us into a number of different types of technology first companies.""Growth Opportunity: Companies like Uber,Alphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG,NASDAQ:GOOGL) andAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) have raised the bar when it comes to apps and cloud technologies. Customers have come to expect that they can get quick service with just a few taps.This is where TWLO is so powerful. The company's systems can easily allow for must-have features to remain competitive.So in light of this, it should be no surprise that the market opportunity for Twilio stock is enormous. According toresearch from IDC, it's estimated at about $45.4 billion.Three Cons to Twilio StockCompetition: It's certainly fierce. Just some of the rivals includeCisco Systems, Inc.(NASDAQ:CSCO),Vonage Holdings Corp.(NYSE:VG), CallFire, Nexmo and Bandwidth.com. In fact, some of TWLO's own customers could wind up being competitors, such asFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB). And telecom operators likeAT&T Inc.(NYSE:T) andVerizon Communications Inc.(NYSE:VZ) could leverage their own networks to take on TWLO.Granted, the low-price strategy of the company has probably been a key in maintaining marketshare. But then again, this may make it tough for it to ultimately get to profitability on a GAAP basis.Customer Concentration: It is fairly heavy. Last year about 30% of revenues came from only 10 customers. Keep in mind that FB's WhatsApp represented 9% and Uber was over 10%. It's important to note that TWLO also generally allows customers to terminate their contracts at any time.What Will Apple Inc. (AAPL) Show Off in Its April Event?Now this is not to say that these customers will suddenly bolt. Again, TWLO has continued to invest in R&D and to provide strong service.Yet there are still risks. Let's face it, large companies can certainly leverage their power to exact better terms, especially when there are alternatives available.Valuation: Even with the plunge in Twilio stock, the multiple is still at hefty levels. Note that the price-to-sales ratio is roughly 10X. Even for a fast-growing cloud company, this is steep.Take a look at some of the valuations in the industry:CompanyPrice-to-Sales MultipleNew Relic Inc(NYSE:NEWR) 8XBox Inc(NYSE:BOX) 5.3XApptio Inc(NASDAQ:APTI) 3XBottom Line on TWLO stockTwilio definitely has a strong platform and it has continued to innovate it. Going forward, the company should benefit from the megatrends of cloud computing and mobile.But for now, it's probably best not to take a position in TWLO stock as the valuation remains fairly high. Let's face it, there are cheaper alternatives available when it comes to fast-growing enterprise plays, such as NEWR, BOX or APTI.Tom Taulli runs the InvestorPlace blogIPO Playbookand is the author of various books, includingTaxes 2017: Saving A Bundle.Follow him on Twitter at@ttaulli.

PayPal's Stock Dips After Google Announces Money Transfer Feature;3/14/2017;"PayPal'sPYPLstock closed the day down 1.5% on Tuesday to $42.10 after Googleannounced in a blog postthat users would now be able to send and receive money in their Gmail app.Alphabet'sGOOGLGoogle said that users would be able to receive and request money as an email attachment through their Gmail App on Android. This service will have no fees, and will work with other email services as well. Recipients can also arrange the money to go straight to their bank account. To use the new feature, users will have to set up a Google Wallet account if they don't have one.Google's move to mobile could be a direct challenge to PayPal's Venmo, the dominant person-to-person mobile payment app and social network.Will It Work?As personal finances become digitalized, users not only want payments to be faster and safer, but millennial users also look to share them. While the Gmail App allows users to send and receive money, users won't be able to brag about their transactions like on Venmo.Venmo users can send money to a friend and write a memo. After the transaction is completed, all of the user's friends on Venmo will be able to see the amount of money sent and the memo. And it turns out that people are interested in knowing whom their friends eat with and where they eat.""A lot of what we're seeing there is that people don't just come to transact. They 're coming there to see what their friends were doing,"" PayPal's chief operating officer Bill Ready said at a Morgan Stanley technology conference in late February.One of the main reasons that PayPal is the top person-to-person vendor in the U.S. is that Venmo processed $5.6 billion in payment volume in the fourth quarter of 2016, an increase of 126%, the company said in its earnings report.Bottom LineIt is hard to say whether or not Google's new feature will disrupt PayPal's dominance in person-to-person transactions. With the introduction of One Touch, a faster check out option online, and Venmo expanding with their ""Pay with Venmo,"" PayPal is certainly fortifying its power in the online transaction service.Zacks' 2017 IPO Watch ListBefore looking into the stocks mentioned above, you may want to get a head start on potential tech IPOs that are popping up on Zacks' radar.

Apple Found Guilty of Price Fixing iPhones in Russia;3/14/2017;"AppleAAPLhas beenfound guilty for price fixingiPhones in Russia by Russian anti-trust regulator FAS (the Federal Antimonopoly Service). Apple has been price fixing in Russia since the release of the iPhone 5 and through the iPhone 6s; allegations against the iPhone 7 have not been proven.The FAS's investigation shows that when retailers in Russia attempted to sell Apple's iPhones at a lower price than what Apple wished, a local subsidiary of Apple would email the retailers demanding them to hike their discounts. If the retailers failed to comply then Apple threatened to terminate their contracts to sell iPhones.No comments have been made from Apple yet; however, FAS head Andrey Tsarikovsky stated Apple has ""actively cooperated"" to resolve the issue. Penalties have yet to be announced; in the meantime, Apple has three months to challenge the ruling if they choose to do so.In translation from a statement by the FAS, their public announcement wrote, ""At the same time, Apple Rus monitored retail prices for Apple iPhone smartphones installed by resellers in online stores and retail outlets, and, in case of setting ""unsuitable"" prices, the Russian subsidiary Apple sent emails to resellers with a request to change them. Also, compliance with recommended retail prices by resellers could be due to the provisions of contracts between Apple Rus and resellers.""Reporters say that the worst case scenario for Apple will be a fine calculated by 15% of Russian sales; however, an official penalty will take several months to figure out.Apple is not the only leading smartphone producer to be found guilty of fraudulent activity in Russia. GoogleGOOGLwas fined $6.75 million by the FAS just last year for preinstalling their apps on Android smartphones and tablets.Zacks' 2017 IPO Watch ListBefore looking into the stocks mentioned above, you may want to get a head start on potential tech IPOs that are popping up on Zacks' radar.

Twitter Is Selling Ads Like It's Television;3/14/2017;"One of the strongest trends in advertising is the shift of   budgets from television to digital as people spend less time   watching conventional TV. Consumers are spending much more time   on social media sites likeFacebook(NASDAQ: FB) ,Twitter(NYSE:TWTR) ,Snap's(NYSE: SNAP) Snapchat, and YouTube -- the subsidiary of Google,   anAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) company.But if advertisers are going to replace television ads with   digital ads, they'd prefer to buy them the same way they buy   those old TV commercials. Twitter is happy to oblige. The company   started offering guaranteed views for pre-roll video ads, and   it's also letting marketers decide what content its ads run   against, according to a report fromAdAge.Back in July, former COO Adam Bain described Twitter's ability   to attract television ad spend as a huge opportunity for the   company. With Twitter's revenue expected to fall this year,   Twitter needs to do everything it can to attract those   budgets.makeArticleAd();""The Starters"" is Twitter's first live show created as part     of its deal with the NBA. Image source: Twitter.A bigger focus on video adsLast month,Twitter decided to reassessits direct response, promoted tweets, and TellApart products, and   focus more intently on video ads. That's where Twitter sees the   potential for its highest return on investment after slashing its   marketing and sales personnel by 9% last fall.The company has been growing the amount of video on its   platform by integrating Periscope, partnering with major media   companies, and shifting to an algorithmic-based timeline so it   can push more videos into users' feeds. In the fourth quarter,   Twitter streamed more than 600 hours of live premium video from   content partners, attracting 31 million unique viewers. Deals   with the NFL, NBA, Bloomberg, and others has opened up a lot of   high-quality video ad inventory similar to television.By offering guarantees on marketers hitting their target   audiences, Twitter should be able to attract more TV ad budgets.   Television networks also offer guarantees, and use extremely   popular events to make good on them if they fail to hit the mark   with the original ad run. Twitter has the advantage of more   advanced targeting capabilities than television, which should   enable it to dynamically insert ads based on users' profiles, and   more easily make good on those guarantees.But Twitter has a lot of competitionTwitter isn't the only company competing for television ad   budgets. Snap explicitly talks about the decline in television   viewership among millennials, its primary demographic, as a   massive opportunity for it to capitalize upon. Snapchat has   several ad formats, and it's currently focusing on increasing the   number of video ads it can show in users' stories, publisher's   stories, and live stories.Meanwhile, Facebook is going after the television ad market by   developing more video features on both its flagship app and   Instagram. Facebook now has a dedicated video section within the   app, and the company is seeding it with high-quality content.   It's been testing mid-roll ads to grab more ad revenue as it   faces saturation of its regular newsfeed ads.YouTube has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of shifting   ad budgets, and now it's looking to prove its worth with literal   TV ads. The impending launch of YouTube TV will provide a few ad   slots per hour for YouTube to fill in its over-the-top streaming   TV service. If YouTube can prove results better than regular   television commercials, it may attract more ad spend to its main   platform, as well.Can Twitter take the pressure?With a growing number of options for marketers to buy   high-quality digital video ads, Twitter has to do what it can to   stand out from the crowd. It's notably outsized by both Facebook   and YouTube, and Snapchat boasts much better engagement and the   demographics marketers look for.Offering guarantees, and more say on what kind of content ads   are paired with, is a good start, but those offers are easily   replicated. YouTube, for example, already offers the option to   buy into Google Preferred, which lets advertisers select specific   packages of the most popular YouTube channels. If the guarantees   make a big difference in buying trends, don't expect Twitter's   victory to last long, as Google and Facebook quickly jump on   board with their own guarantees.10 stocks we like better than TwitterWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Web Browsers Are Making A Comeback, Just Not In The U.S.;3/14/2017;"In the U.S. where the monthly data plan and Wi-Fi are abundant, the market for single-purpose apps like FacebookFBand SnapchatSNAPhas flourished. However, across the world, it is not apps that are racking up users but mobile web browsers.Browsers are popular again, especially in developing countries, where data plans are not accessible for everyone and prepaid data plans can't support data heavy single-purpose apps. Users are finding themselves turning to web browsers to stay connected.It is not a second choice either. While it may feel like apps are faster and easier to use, browser developers have been working hard to compensate users. Not only have browser companies like UC Browser from AlibabaBABA, Google Chrome from Alphabet Inc.GOOGLand Opera Mini by Opera Software, have made their browsers data-efficient, but these companies have also beenadding new featureslike voice recognition, file sharing and integration with social media.In countries where it is easy to buy used or refurbished smartphones for as little as $25, it is easy to see why users lean towards web browsers instead of single-purpose apps. You spend less and achieve more.The number of Internet users globally has reached around 3.5 billion and many of the people that became Internet users in the past few years are all part of the rise of the global middle class in emerging markets. And they provided the biggest user growth for browser makers. These companies also know how to keep their users occupied and monetizing them through mobile advertising.Internet giants like Google and Facebook are noticing these trends. Two thirds of Facebook's users are in emerging markets and Google's Chrome remains the dominant browser in many emerging markets. Facebook has Facebook Lite, an app designed for low-bandwidth users and Google pays other search engines to direct search traffic to ad-supported Google services.It is logical that these new users in the emerging markets will likely follow in the footsteps of their richer peers and make the shift from web browsers to apps as they get wealthier and data becomes cheaper, though this doesn't worry the browser developers. There will always be a new group of users joining emerging market.India is projected to increase its per-capita income by 125% by 2025 with its population of 1.3 billion people, according to Morgan StanleyMS. Opera Software said Africa is growing the fastest in terms of new downloads and there are 600 million potential users in Southeast Asia, which is a huge market for these browsers.Until cellular connection become more accessible and affordable, web browsers will maintain its popularity.Zacks' 2017 IPO Watch ListBefore looking into the stocks mentioned above, you may want to get a head start on potential tech IPOs that are popping up on Zacks' radar.

Can Intel Catch Tesla, Google, Apple In Autonomous Car Race?;3/14/2017;"Thanks to its$15.3 billion acquisitionof Israeli self-driving technology company Mobileye (MBLY), Intel (INTC) is no longer on the outside looking in when it comes to the autonomous car market, which has become the new battleground for high-tech companies looking new revenue streams.While Intel’s semiconductor prowess and breadth in R&D should accelerate the pace of Mobileye’s technology innovation, will the combined company have enough tread to catch the likes of Tesla (TSLA) and Google (GOOGL)?Intel seems to think so. The deal, which sent MBLY stock soaring 28% in active trade Monday, ""merges the intelligent eyes of the autonomous car with the intelligent brain that actually drives the car,” said Intel CEO Brian Krzanich in a statement. “The saying 'what's under the hood' will increasingly refer to computing, not horsepower.”makeArticleAd();Investors weren’t immediately impressed, sending Intel shares down 2.1% to close at a three-month low of $35.16. This isn’t Intel’s first run at self-driving cars, however. The Santa Clara, Calif.-based chip giant, through its financing arm Intel Capital, hasspent $250 millionin R&D looking for an edge. The Mobileye deal, meanwhile, has now made it known that autonomous driving capabilities was never a hobby for Intel. It’s become a critical market for the company.Still, Tesla and Google won’t be run off the road. In December, GooglelaunchedWaymo, which stands for “a new way forward in mobility.” Waymo’s website features a two-seater prototype fitted with Google’s hardware and software that is built to move with the touch of a button, with neither a steering wheel nor a brake pedal. Meanwhile, in Tesla’s most popular sedan, the Model S, the company has already rolled out self-driving capabilities that receive incremental updates on autopilot features.These updates, which include “exit ramp autonomy” on highways, automatic lane-changing, and auto-steering, are also available to Model X, its SUV family. And to say nothing about Apple’s (AAPL) own autonomous car ambitions, which theWall Street Journalrecently confirmed. With more money stashed than the U.S. Treasury, Apple’s autonomous car position depends only on how hard it wants to mash the accelerator.But here’s the thing: Mobileye was once a prominent partner to Tesla, meaning it could have had first-hand knowledge of what Tesla has under its hood. And to the extent Intel can utilize that knowledge to accelerate its own technology, Intel will narrow that gap relatively quickly.At the same time, the fact that Intel wants to emerge as the go-to chip name when it comes to autonomous car processors, powering functions such as displays and communication between two self-driving vehicles, Intel doesn’t necessarily have to be the car, it can just be the brainsinsidethe car — something it thrived on during the height of the PC era."

Don’t Follow Warren Buffett Into Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock … Yet;3/14/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhen it comes to investing, Warren Buffett says investors should go with index funds. But Buffett himself takes a different approach by buying individual stocks, such asApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL). The question is: Should you do as Buffett says and index, or do as Buffettdoes, and buy AAPL stock?makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockBuffett's lack of technology exposure is well-known among Wall Street veterans. In fact, many even ridiculed the Oracle of Omaha for missing out names like Apple,Alphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL) andAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN).Until Apple came along,International Business Machines Corp.(NYSE:IBM) was Buffett's largest tech play. He used to say he skipped over tech stocks because he didn't understand them well enough.But it appears that Buffett's understanding of technology is growing.I n 2016,Berkshire Hathaway Inc.(NYSE:BRK.B) reported a 9.8 million-share position in AAPL stock as of March 31. That position almost doubled to 15.2 million shares as of Sept. 30, then almost quadrupled to a whopping 57.3 million shares by year's end.So what has Buffett done with AAPL stock in 2017?7 Blue-Chip Stocks Holding You BackThe Oracle of Omahahas more than doubled his position. The stake now stands at some 133 million shares worth about $18.1 billion. Buffett buying some 75 million shares of AAPL stock in such a short span shows confidence in Apple.While Buffett is not known for his short-term predictions, he is heralded for his long-term investments. So, what does he like so much about Apple stock anyway? ""Apple strikes me as having quite a sticky product, and an enormously useful product to people that use it,"" Buffett told CNBC in late-February.Perhaps the most ironic part of Buffett's discussion on Apple centered on his own device - the famed investor doesn't even own an iPhone.Positives for AAPL StockApple stock has a lot of positives. For starters, the company is flush with cash. With more than $40 per share of cash, Apple could go on a transformative M&A spree - even with the repatriation tax that, right now, it would have to pay. Add in the potential for a tax repatriation holiday from the Trump administration, and Apple's in even better shape.Additionally, Apple is a cash cow that continues to bring in billions of dollars each quarter, which should help continue to fund dividends and stock buybacks. Plus, its cash hoard should continue to grow over time.Despite rallying more than 40% over the past eight months, AAPL stock still trades with a below-market valuation. Sporting a price-to-earnings ratio of around 16, it's hard to consider Apple overvalued.And the valuation argument is important. Too many investors try to justify a higher Apple stock price by applying a market-average multiple. That's an inaccurate measurement, as Apple tends to trade between a P/E range of 10 to 17 (more on that in a moment). So rarely will it trade in-line with the averageS&P 500stock.With that said, having a low valuation is part of what makes Apple stock attractive. Shares go through pretty extreme ups and downs. But long-term investors can feel confident in buying a stock that's not egregiously priced.Finally, investors can look forward to Apple releasing themuch-anticipated iPhone 8later this fall. With a higher potential selling price and plenty of fancy features, the new device is likely to drive record results.Add on its quickly growing, high-margin Services business, and AAPL stock becomes even more attractive for long-term investors.Should You Follow Buffett Into AAPL Stock?With all these positives, Apple stock may seem like a slam-dunk.However, I think investors would be best off waiting for a pullback. While we just highlighted its P/E ratio as a positive, itisclose to the top of its five-year range. AAPL stock is cheap compared to the average stock, but getting expensive compared to its historical average.Additionally, Apple stock has gone on a massive rally. While it's admittedly consolidating nicely just under $140, I find it hard to be a buyer at these levels.Why General Electric Company (GE) Stock Is Way Too DangerousWith the overall market still up big, I can sleep more comfortably at night waiting for a pullback to buy Apple stock. If it doesn't materialize, that is something waiting investors will have to live with. I would rather miss a few points of upside in order to avoid significant points on the downside.Historically, Apple's stock is volatile, whichmakes a pullback likelyat some point in the next few months.A 7% to 10% correction would be needed for me to get interested.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author ofFuture Blue Chips.

How a Major Drugmaker Plans to Cure Disease... Without Drugs;3/14/2017;"Pharmaceutical giantGlaxoSmithKline plc(NYSE: GSK) has the resources to pursue long-term bets in   medicine that could eventually change the course of disease   treatment and yield large payoffs. Three and half years ago the   company announced its plans for an audacious goal: to literally   eavesdrop on the body's electrical system and enter into the   body's own internal conversations in order to heal disease.Not as crazy as it soundsMedicine has long focused on chemical processes to alter   biological function, but every organ has a nerve connection that   regulates its function. Organs are controlled by patterns of   electrical impulses transmitted through nerve fibers, but when   organs dysfunction in chronic disease, the electrical patterns   are different. That fact opens up the possibility that inserting   patterns in nerves to certain organs can correct conditions that   lead to disease. Using electrical impulses to influence organ   function is nothing new -- cardiac pacemakers have been in use   for decades -- but scientists are just beginning to realize the   possibilities of using nerve signals to restore organs to normal   function and actually treat disease.Image source: GlaxoSmithKline plc.makeArticleAd();A seminal paper was published in the scientific journal Nature   in 2000 which presented evidence that stimulation of the vagus   nerve could actually trigger an anti-inflammatory response in   rats. Electrical stimulation of the nerve inhibited the   production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), which is also the   mechanism used by some blockbuster anti-inflammatory drugs such   asAbbVie's Humira. Since then, researchers have come to believe that   influencing the the body's electrical system could lead to   treatments for conditions as diverse as asthma, arthritis,   inflammatory bowel disease, hypertension, diabetes, infertility,   and even cancer. A drug gets dispersed throughout the body,   affecting multiple pathways and organs in the process and   potentially causing undesired side effects, but targeting the   signals of a specific nerve bundle with an implanted device has   the potential for producing highly localized and specific   effects.GlaxoSmithKline announced in 2013 an effort to pour resources   into the field of bioelectronics, taking a leadership role in the   industry. The company announced a $1 million innovation prize,   the creation and funding of a network of researchers, and the   launch of a $50 million venture capital fund, Action Potential   Venture Capital, to invest in pioneering bioelectronic   technologies.The investment is already producing visible progress. The   first investment by the venture capital fund was in SetPoint   Medical, a privately held California company that is developing a   platform to treat inflammatory diseases by modulating nerve   signals with implanted devices and was co-founded by one of the   authors of the original 2000 paper in Nature. In July 2016 the   company reported the results of a first-in-human study of vagal   nerve stimulation by an implanted device for treatment of   arthritis. The study showed that the approach inhibited TNF   production and improved symptoms, including in some patients who   had not responded to conventional drug treatments. In January   2017, SetPoint reported positive results of another human study   using its device to treat Crohn's disease.Googling the body's internal networkImage source: GlaxoSmithKline plc.As encouraging as the results from SetPoint are, that approach   is primitive compared with the ambitions of a $715 million joint   venture that Glaxo andAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) birthed last August called Galvani   Bioelectronics. The collaboration with Verily Life Sciences,   formerly known as Google Life Sciences, aims to do no less than   to map the human nervous system, crack the electrical codes   flowing through nerves controlling the body's organs, and be able   to modify the signals to restore health using implantable   devices the size of a grain of rice.The effort has enormous potential... and enormous challenges.   Verily will contribute expertise in device miniaturization and   software. The tiny devices will need a read/write interface to   nerve fibers and a way to be powered without heating the body --   both significant technical problems yet to be solved. The   approach will also require the analysis and interpretation of   massive amounts of data taken from the signals sensed on   individual bundles of nerves controlling the targeted organs,   something that's right up Google's alley. Glaxo, for its part,   has been working for several years on a ""nerve atlas"" with the   goal of identifying the specific nerve fibers whose signals will   need to be decoded and modulated.A long shot, but we could get news by 2019Executives from GlaxoSmithKline and Verily are optimistic,   though. At the time of the announcement last August, Glaxo   executive Moncef Slaoui expressed the belief that Galvani could   begin human trials within 18 months, achieve proof of concept in   three years, and begin commercialization in seven years. This   timeline puts the effort on the radar of long-term investors, who   could be seeing news on developments in the next few years.The challenge is huge, but then so is the potential   payoff. ""Bioelectronic medicines have the potential of doing   to the pharmaceutical industry what biopharmaceuticals did to   small molecules back in the 1980s,"" says Imran Eba,   partner in Action Potential Venture Capital. If that happens,   GlaxoSmithKline could be in ideal position to benefit from the   next big disruption in medical technology.10 stocks we like better than GlaxoSmithKlineWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Carries Some Risks;3/14/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsI recently wrote anarticlesuggesting thatAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) was the perfect value play, as it was a growth stock that was not unreasonably valued based on various criteria. Now I'll dive into what I think the risks of GOOGL stock are, and how they may manifest.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockMy biggest concern with GOOGL stock has always been that it is effectively a one-trick pony. Alphabet is the largest digital advertising billboard in the world, with about 88% of its revenues coming from advertising. Moreover, GOOGL stock's growth has been driven by this spectacular seizure of internet territory from competitors.In fact, during the financial crisis, ad revenues still grew about 8% year-over-year in 2009 despite a worldwide ad revenuedeclineof 11% that year.GOOGL Stock and Digital AdvertisingNow, digital advertising was still in its hyper-growth phase back then. Should another major crisis hit, I'm not so sure that Alphabet won't see a decline. Yet what's so astonishing about GOOGL stock is just how much money it makes from advertising. It could get hit with a 20% decline in total revenues, which would bring it roughly in line with fiscal year 2015 results, and still generate net income of $15 billion or so, and operating cash flow of $26 billion or so.This is hardly a catastrophe, which shows that for now at least, GOOGL has a lock on substantial growth in ad revenue. However, that advertising is the result of people using Google's search engine. What if that changes? Right now, Google has more than 80% search engine marketshare. It's so popular that we now use the product's name as a verb.7 Blue-Chip Stocks Holding You BackI think it will be very difficult to supplant Google as far as search engine usage goes. However, there is other behavior which may result in less reliance on the search engine and, therefore, fewer eyeballs for ads. Mobile apps have obviously exploded in number and usage. The more adept and fully functional that apps become, the less Google may be used.Social media is only going to grow, and the more that these products offer in terms of either their own search engines, or places for advertisers to divide their ad spend, the worse it is for GOOGL.There's also some interesting competition in the form of product searches, and of course, that competition comes fromAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN). According to a 2016 PowerReviewssurvey, 38% of users use Amazon as a place to search for products, and Google comes in second at 35%. I think about my own usage when it comes to product searched, and yes, I always start with Amazon. Inventory, price and reviews are the reasons why people start there. The larger that Amazon grows, the stickier it will become as far as product searches, and that could mean fewer eyeballs for GOOGL.Obviously, Alphabet Inc. has plenty of money and can ramp up competition in mobile access, butApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) andFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) obviously have a corner on that market so far.What Nvidia Needs to Avoid a Breakdown (NVDA)There is some regulatory risk, as well. The EU slammed Alphabet Inc. for tweaking search results to direct people to its own shopping sites. The FCC is an unknown beast - it could end up regulating the internet in ways harmful to GOOGL stock.However, when it comes to buying the stock, I don't see immediate dangers to GOOGL that makes its valuation less attractive. At 18x next year's earnings, and five-year annualized analyst projections of 19.3% growth, it's already undervalued. When I give it a 10% premium for global brand name, cash flow and cash on hand, it becomes a true growth and value play.

3 Reasons Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Is Becoming Tougher to Own;3/14/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBy most accounts, the future looks bright forApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL). Citi recently upped its price target on Apple stock in anticipation of a massive wave of upgrades from iPhone owners who have aging models, and the company's plans to double its high-margin service revenue over the course of the coming four years doesn't seem un-doable.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockAfter all, AAPL has been beefing up its app and digital content business at a rather brisk pace for some time now.And yet, to observers not looking at the company through rose-colored glasses, there's potential trouble ahead. Here's a closer look at three headwinds that could slow AAPL shares down more than most traders might expect.Three Troubling Realities for Apple StockLast week, analysts with Citi raised their price target on Apple stock from $140 to $160 per share (maintaining the research outfit's ""Buy"" rating), thinking a wide swath of the 715 million iPhone owners out there right now are on the verge of finally upgrading their device, as31% of those owners haven't upgraded in a couple of years.It's not bad logic; we know the company's best new customers are its old ones.10 Dangerous Dividend Stocks to Dump NowMeanwhile, though it was little more than an afterthought just a year ago, CEO Tim Cook has put plenty of emphasis on sales of services and digital content. He's only scratched the surface, however. After generating roughly $25 billion in revenue in 2016, Apple is aiming for $50 billion in services revenue by $50 billion. That's still only a fraction of the $215 billion worth of revenue Apple mustered in 2016, but digital sales now make up the company's second-biggest segment; the iPhone is still the biggest.Before we pop the corks on the champagne bottles though, there are three red flags everyone would be wise to process.1. The iPhone 8 (probably) costs too muchWhile the launch of the iPhone 7 in the fall of last year could be considered a success in that the company sold arecord-breaking 78.2 million units in the previous quarter, given thehype surrounding the device, the company should have blown away sales figures for its iPhone 6.Some (many) suspect the demand that should have materialized for the 7 was ultimately displaced to the iPhone 8, which is supposed to be unveiled in September of this year. The word is that the admittedly impressive device is going togo for a cool $1000 each. At that price, even the most loyal of Apple fans could balk.2. The popular smartphone is preemptively cannibalizing itselfAside from sticker shock, would-be owners of the upcoming iPhone 8 may keep their wallet closed for the same reason many potential buyers of the iPhone 7 didn't pull the trigger - they're waiting for the phone after the next phone, which is sure to be even more amazing.To that end, what's currently being referred to as the iPhone 9 already promises (in rumors) to be an amazing piece of hardware,complete with a folding screen. That may postpone purchases of the iPhone 8 later this year, though 2018's iPhone 9 could see softer demand because whispers of the iPhone 10 rumors will be circulating by then.It's a vicious cycle, with Apple arguably unable to ever really log a blowout iPhone launch.Fitbit Has BlackBerry Syndrome (FIT)3. The Google Pixel is really, really impressiveFinally, as solid as the recent Pixel phone fromAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) subsidiary Google was, it wasn't a game-changer. Analysts estimate the companyonly sold about 2.5 million of the device.Bear in mind, however, this is Google's first direct foray into the smartphone world, and could be considered little more than a dry run.The Pixel 2 is slated to debut sometime this year, and it's a good bet the company has made a point of learning a lot with its first outing.Bottom Line for AAPL StockInvariably, some (or several) owners of Apple stock interpret these concerns as a call that the company is doomed, and then proceed to ""colorfully disagree."" So, let me clarify something that shouldn't need saying. That is, even on AAPL stock's worst day it's still essentially unstoppable to other smartphone players. Don't read too much into the worries.On the flipside, in that Apple stock is all too often found on investors' pedestals - lifted there by assumptions that the company is infallible - it's never a bad idea to recognize all plausible risks. These three risks could each end up stirring up surprising headwinds, and nothing takes a toll on a stock like an unexpected disappointment.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace7 Blue-Chip Stocks Holding You Back7 Future Blue-Chip Stocks You Need to BuyThe post3 Reasons Apple Inc.

About to Buy Driverless Car Stocks? Read This First;3/13/2017;"There's no shortage of technology companies and automotive   makers that are are betting that autonomous vehicles will   transform both of their industries. But how do you figure   out which companies are poised to benefit the most?To answer that, investors first need to know what the market   potential is for driverless cars, what might slow it down, and   how long it will take for the segment to mature, and then   determine which driverless car investment angle they want to   take. Here are a few steps to help you get started:Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();How much the driverless car market will be     worthBy 2025, the driverless car market is expected to be worth $42   billion, according to Boston Consulting Group. The market size   jumps up to $77 billion by 2035, which is the same year thatIHSestimates that there will be 76 million autonomous vehicles   already on the road.And it doesn't end there. Driverless cars are expected to   transform ride sharing services, allow car owners to rent out   their own vehicles -- asTesla's(NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO Elon Musk has suggested -- and even help   traditional carmakers create their own ride hailing services,   likeFord(NYSE: F) has proposed.This might slow driverless car stocks downIt's not going to be all sunshine and lollipops for driverless   car stocks though. There are still many hurdles facing these   companies, including federal regulations, safety concerns, and   consumer adoption issues.The two biggest automotive markets, however -- the U.S. and   China -- have thus far been very open to driverless cars. Back in   September, the federal government released guidelines for states   to help ensure that companies are able to innovate and not be   hampered by differing rules across state lines. But the problem   is that we're still in the very early stages of driverless   car technology (i.e. neither you nor I can buy fully autonomous   vehicles), so while the government is open to it now, that could   change when more tech starts being used by the general   population.And even if the government doesn't end up stifling autonomous   vehicles, there's currently a growing movement toban driverless cars in New Yorkbecause people are afraid they'll eliminate jobs for taxi   drivers, bus drivers and others in the transportation sector. Add   to that the fact that there are parts of the population thatfeel very uneasyabout driverless cars and it's clear that the autonomous vehicle   market still has a long way to go.There are plenty of ways to investCompanies like Tesla are among the obvious choices for betting   on driverless cars. CEO Elon Musk has said he wants to have a   fully autonomous car capable of driving itself across the country   by 2018, and every new Tesla built right now already has the   hardware capabilities for full autonomy (though not all of the   software is activated).Tech behemothAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) is another clear choice. Google's   parent company recently spun out its driverless car segment into   its own company,called Waymo, and is working to bring fully autonomous minivans to the roads   this year for public testing, along with a ride-sharing   service.And then there are chipmakers likeNVIDIA(NASDAQ: NVDA) , which is investing heavily in artificial   intelligence and its own supercomputers to power driverless cars.   The company'sDrive PX 2 supercomputeris already used by 80 automakers and automotive suppliers   (including Tesla) and is likely to expand its automotive revenues   substantially in the coming years.Of course, you could go the traditional route too and bet on   automakers like Ford, which is also focusing its attention on   self-driving technologies. The company recently invested $1   billion in a self-driving car start-up, called Argo AI, and says   that it will release its own fully autonomous vehicle (with no   steering wheel!) by 2021.Ford may be taking a slower approach than some other   self-driving tech makers, but it has plans to have 90   self-driving test vehicles on the road this year and is working   with more than 40 start-ups on driverless car technology.And if you're looking for a driverless car stock outside of   the U.S., thenBaidu(NASDAQ: BIDU)  isprobably your best bet. The company has been developing self-driving technology for   years and just launched a test program in some Chinese cities to   implement its tech. The company wants to release a fully   self-driving car by next year with the hopes of having a   ride-hailing service in the coming years. Aside from its   aggressive driverless car approach, Baidu benefits from China's   openness to self-driving technologies and fewer regulations for   road tests than the U.S.Here's how long you might need to wait for this to play     outAlright, so now we know how big this market will be, some of   the potential hurdles, and who the key players are. So how long   will investors have to wait for this opportunity to pan out? IHS   estimates that we'll reach worldwide driverless car ubiquity by   about 2050.That doesn't mean it'll take that long for driverless car   stocks to benefit of course, but it does mean that we still have   a long way to go before the market will mature -- which makes now   the perfect time for investors to start considering driverless   car stocks.10 stocks we like better than NvidiaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Does DISH, Sony, or AT&T Have the Best Live-Streaming Cable Deal?;3/13/2017;"Cable without an actual cable may be the next big thing not   just for cord-cutters looking to save a buck, but also for   consumers looking to leave their current providers without making   a major sacrifice.DISH Network(NASDAQ: DISH) was the first player in the space with the launch   of its live-streaming cable alternative a little over two years   ago.Sony(NYSE: SNE) began testing its own PlayStation Vue in select   markets not long after that and has since taken its cable-like   streaming product national. Most recently,AT&T(NYSE: T) launched DirecTV Now, giving consumers three distinct   choices (not counting the not-yet-launched options from YouTube   and Hulu which are still developing).For consumers it's a lot of choices, but unlike traditional   cable where every company offers roughly the same package, these   three players are somewhat different. That makes determining the   best one a bit of a moving target, but with three players in the   space (and two more coming) it's clearly a buyer's market.makeArticleAd();DISH Sling has the cheapest offer. Image source: DISH.DISH has the lowest base priceFor consumers looking to cut the cord in order to save money   (or those who never had a cord, but are looking for the cheapest   way to have some live-streaming channels) DISH'sSling   TVmay be the answer. The service offers 30 channels including ESPN,   CNN, TNT, and a number of other cable favorites for $20 a month   as part of its ""Orange"" package. For $25 a month consumers could   opt for ""Blue"" which drops ESPN but adds the FOX family of   channels including the broadcast network while offering 44 total   choices.On top of the base packages Sling Subscribers can choose from   a number of extra add-ons in areas like news, sports, and kids   programming which cost $5 or $10 each. Sling members can also add   HBO, Cinemax, Starz, or one of a variety of global programming   options which conveniently all work within the same player making   for a very television-like experience.PlayStation Vue is cord-free cableSony's PlayStation Vue has four packages starting at $29.99 a   month. The entry-level offer, ""Access Slim"" comes with 45   channels, including in very-limited markets some broadcast   networks. Most of the stations offered are the same ones Sling TV   has, with consumers paying slightly more money for them. The   ""Core Slim"" package offers 60 channels for $34.99 (perhaps the   best deal) while ""Elite Slim"" comes with 90 channels for $44.99,   and Ultra Slim at $64.99 which has the same 90 channels plus HBO   and Showtime.Like Sling, PlayStation Vue also offers add-on packages of   Spanish-language and news programs. In addition users can buy a   number of premium channels on a stand-alone basis along with HBO   and Showtime. The bottom tiers for PS Vue are very similar to   DISH, albeit pricier, while the higher-end tiers are essentially   full-on cable packages (minus the broadcast networks in most   cases) at better-than-cable pricing.Here's what DirecTV is doingAT&T's entree into the space looks a lot like Sony's.   DirecTV Now offers very similar pricing with 60 channels costing   $35, including ABC and FOX, along with some top-tier cable   favorites. $50 a month gets users 80-plus channels, while $60 a   month comes with over 100, and $70 takes the package to over 120   stations including Starz.Subscribers can also add Starz separately to lower-tier deals,   or add HBO or Cinemax. AT&T does not offer add-on channel   packages covering specialty stations the way its rivals do. In   addition DirecTV Now launches with better pricing (the $35 price   for the $50 package) and it seems likely that AT&T will offer   future specials likely tied to bundling other services from the   company.Which one is the best?For consumers it's easy to test each service because all offer   free trials, while also letting users come and go as they please   without contracts or penalties. Sling has the best service for   people looking to cut expenses while Sony and AT&T offer good   deals on services that come close to mirroring actual cable. Of   those two, DirecTV Now gets a slight edge because it offers ABC   and FOX nationally while PlayStation Vue only offers access to   broadcast networks selectively.In addition to varying channel selections, all three services   have different rules when it comes to multiple streams. Sling   Orange, the cheapest service, only offers a single stream, while   the $25 Blue packages allows three. DirectTV Now offers two   streams to all subscribers while Sony's service allows customers   to stream on five registered devices at a time giving PS Vue the   advantage in this area, but it's a minor edge over Blue.When it comes to interface all three leave something to be   desired. Sony's service has a DVR (with a lot of limitations)   while Sling has some on-demand programming, as does DirecTV. The   biggest drawback of the streaming services is that none of them   offer an experience that feels like flipping around with   traditional cable. Still, once you have selected a show, the   viewing experience works and feels familiar.Sony and AT&T have decent products that save consumers   some money over the average comparable cable package. But for a   traditional family watching on multiple televisions, the savings   may not be worth the holes in what's offered along with a viewing   experience that still lags traditional cable. Sling has those   same limitations, but the three streams for $25 Blue package   represents the best combo of content and value, giving it a small   victory in an emerging space.10 stocks we like better than DISH NetworkWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Should Apple Inc. Cut Its Dividend? (AAPL);3/13/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) is the world's largest technology company, and it once was one of the best growth stocks on the market. It has shifted gears, though, and now Apple stock is one of the more promising dividend growth plays on the market.makeArticleAd();Source:FlickrAAPL paid its first dividend - at least since 1995 - on Aug. 16, 2012. It paid investors 38.9 cents per share on a split-adjusted basis.The payout has been hiked four times since, and currently sits at 57 cents per share. That's a compound annual growth rate of 10%, with 2017's dividend increase expected to be similar. After all, AAPL stock only has a payout ratio of 27% of its trailing earnings and a 1.6% yield.When you look at shareholder yield - dividends plus buybacks - Apple's record is even more impressive. The company spent $12.2 billion on dividends and a whopping $29.2 billion on share repurchases in 2016. That works out to a shareholder yield of 5.6%.AAPL is returning capital at a blistering pace.10 Monthly Dividend Stocks to Buy to Pay the BillsHowever, while most shareholders are ecstatic with the dividend on Apple stock, allow me to present an alternate argument:Apple should cut its payout … and maybe even eliminate it altogether.Apple, Meet AlphabetLet's take a minute to compare Apple to one of its peers,Alphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL).Alphabet's dividend policy is pretty clear. It saidin its 2016 10-K filing, ""We have never declared or paid any cash dividend on our common or capital stock. We intend to retain any future earnings and do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.""Alphabet can easily afford a dividend, too. It made $19.5 billion in 2016, or $28.32 per share.The reasoning behind this is simple. Alphabet is aggressively investing in the kinds of projects that can really boost its top line. It has been working on a self-driving car since 2009. It invested more than$6 billion on Google Fiber. Alphabet also teamed up withFidelitytoinvest $1 billion inSpaceX.In total, Alphabet spent $13.9 billion on research and development in 2016, as well as $10.2 billion on capital expenditures.Apple is still investing in the future, but not as aggressively as Alphabet. AAPL spent $10 billion on research and development and $13.5 billion on capital expenditures in 2016, despite making a net profit of $45.7 billion.In other words, Alphabet reinvested $24.1 billion back into its business in 2016 while earning $19.5 billion. Apple reinvested $23.5 billion while earning $45.7 billion. AAPL barely reinvested half of its earnings back into its business.AAPL Needs to Make Some AcquisitionsApple does have some exciting plans. One of the tech world's worst-kept secrets is Apple's plans to somehow be a part of thecar of the future. It has also been working in thevirtual reality space, and many expect big improvements toApple TV. These investments are great. But I don't think they'll be enough to usher in a new era of growth.It's time for Apple to go shopping.Apple could easily take the $41 billion it gave back to shareholders in 2016 and use it to make a huge splash.Say Apple agreed to buyNetflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX) at a 50% premium to today's price - so, roughly $91 billion. AAPL could pay off the deal in just a few years from its existing cash flow alone, and would own a company that has doubled revenues in the last three years.Intel Corporation (INTC) Buys Mobileye NV (MBLY) to Win the Auto MarketApple's main growth driver today is service revenue. In its most recent quarter, AAPL grew its top line 3% on a quarter-over-quarter basis.It grew services revenue by 18%. Acquiring Netflix would would not only supercharge that division, it would give Apple access to Netflix's whole library of content.The Bottom Line on Apple StockThere's a reason why AAPL trades at the same multiple as the rest of the market. Investors assume - rightfully so - that it is a mature company with no immediate growth prospects. If Apple slashed its dividend and announced it was using that money for acquisitions, investors would sit up and take notice.There's no guarantee such sentiment would send Apple stock soaring right away. In fact, it'd be easy to see the market taking the short-term view that something is amiss, and selling AAPL as a result.But if executed right, such a strategy would make Apple shareholders richer in the long run.As of this writing, Nelson Smith did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Can NVIDIA Regain Its Mojo?;3/13/2017;"It seems somewhat disingenuous referring to a stock that has   rallied roughly 530% over the last five years as having ""lost its   mojo.""However, the fact remains that shares of graphics chip leaderNVIDIA(NASDAQ: NVDA) have indeed fallen roughly 18% from their 52-week   high in early February.makeArticleAd();NVDAdata byYCharts.So, how should investors think about this newfound bearishness   in NVIDIA shares? Does the sell-off in its stock represent a   paradigm shift in investor sentiment toward the company, or does   it create an attractive potential entry point? Let's explore this   topic in greater detail.NVIDIA stock: What goes up must come down?The only major news to break since NVIDIA's stock peaked --   which occurred on February 7th -- was the company's release   of its full-year and fourth-quarter results for its fiscal year   2017, which took place on February 9th. As a quick point of   clarification, NVIDIA runs its fiscal year one full year ahead of   the calendar year, for some odd reason.At any rate, NVIDIA actually released earnings that exceeded   analyst estimates in terms of sales and profits.If anything, it seems safe to say that some investors have   been simply taking profits on their NVIDIA investments, a   strategy that seems sensible for short-term investors concerned   about NVDIIA's admittedly rich valuation. Moreover, while it   enjoys many well-defined positives, there is one potential storm   forming on the horizon that could sap some of the wind from   NVIDIA's sails.Long-time graphics laggardAdvanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD) plans to launch its Vega chip series later this   year, a move that some analysts believe could allow AMD to steal   significant market GPU market share from NVIDIA. Though we don't   know any of the specifics regarding AMD's Vega chips yet, the   hope is that they will serve as a cheaper alternative to NVIDIA's   GTX chip series, while not sacrificing much in the way of   performance. If that proves to be the case, NVIDIA could be   forced to lower the prices of corresponding chipsets. Of course,   worrying about this is putting the cart before the horse to a   certain extent, but it bears noting as something that could   inhibit NVIDIA's growth. And given NVIDIA'ssky-high valuation, that could be enough to compel investors sitting on large paper   gains to sell.Image source: NVIDIA.NVIDIA long-term business outlook remains favorableIn as much as NVIDIA has indeed ""lost its mojo,"" it's   important to remember that NVIDIA's multiyear investment thesis   appearsas strong as ever. As we saw in its earnings release, the main drivers   underpinning NVIDIA's growth today are high-end gaming,   artificial intelligence (AI) software, and self-driving cars.eSports still don't receive a lot of coverage from the   mainstream media, but the craze's momentum is undeniable.   eSport's global audience was estimated to reach 256 million   viewers in 2016, according to one industry researcher. Large   events regularly enjoy sponsorship from blue-chip brands likeCoca-Cola,Nissan, and more, which has led to a dramatic increase in purse sizes   for some of the genre's most popular events. This, in turn, has   helped increase the awareness of the pastime to many casual fans,   particularly in Asia, where the sport is most popular. The   same researcher believes total revenue related to eSports will   reach $1.1 billion by 2019, up from $463 million in 2016. The   rush of money and interest into the sport should help continue to   create demand for NVIDIA's best-of-breed graphics processing   chips, which rose 44% last year.Better still, major trends like AI software and driverless   cars remain in their early stages. Last year, NVIDIA saw an   unprecedented surge in demand for its GPUs to power an impressive   host of applications. NVIDIA's GPUs are the chip of choice to   power the various AI projects at tech giants such asMicrosoft,Alphabet,Facebook, the National Cancer Institute, the U.S. Department of Energy,   and many others. Turning to self-driving cars, NVIDIA has also   partnered with an impressive array of major automakers,   though this technology figures to more meaningfully contribute to   its growth early next decade.Not to belabor the point, but hopefully it's clear now that   NVIDIA has far from lost its mojo. True, the company's stock   prices has fallen from its recent all-time highs, but it easily   remains in positive territory over the last 12 months, and for   good reason. NVIDIA is one of the best-positioned companies to   profit from several of the largest continuing trends in   technology.10 stocks we like better than NvidiaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Rev Up Free Profits from Ford Motor Company (F) Stock;3/13/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsLast year, I delivered results tradingFord Motor Company(NYSE:F), the easiest of which was a range trade thatyielded 50%. This year I am chasing a potential breakout that has been slowly developing.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockFundamentally, Ford has good management pedigree. They weathered the effects of the 2008 financial crisis as well as could be expected. For the last few years we've had record vehicle sales.Therein lies my frustration with this breakout. Everything is going the auto manufacturing industry, yet their stocks have yet to wow us. Ford stock has been in a descending trend for almost two years.Click to EnlargeEquity markets are at all-time highs. With auto sales also at or near record levels, I expect better performance from F stock. For some reason it's mired under $13 and in a descending trend.General Motors Company(NYSE:GM), on the other hand, has enjoyed an ascending 12 month trend.Even so, I still like the Ford trade better.10 Monthly Dividend Stocks to Buy to Pay the BillsTechnically, the recent price action in F stock has been building energy. We see lower highs and higher lows coming to a tight point. This energy needs to resolve itself soon. Unless there is bad news coming from Ford or a general equity correction, the move should be to the upside.If that happens, it could rally 8% to 10%. Today I want to set a pair trade to capture the upside breakout.F Stock Trade IdeaThe Bet:Buy the F May $13 call for 23 cents per contract. This will give me over two months to capture an upside move.To lower my out-of-pocket expenses, I will finance the bet by selling risk against lower levels of Ford that I deem safe given the current environment.The Bank:Sell the F Sept $11 put and collect 35 cents. This is a bullish trade that commits me to buying F stock if price falls below it. I have an 85% theoretical chance of having F stock stay above my sold put. I only sell naked puts if I am willing to own it there.Taking both trades means that I am getting paid to bet on a Ford stock rally. Even if nothing happens, I would be left with a net credit. As long as the price stays above $11 per share, any premium I collect from selling back the May call is pure profit.Since I am not required to hold my trades open through expiration, I can close any of them for partial gains or losses at any time.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director ofSellSpreads.com.

Buy First Solar, Inc. (FSLR) Stock, Make 55% in 18 Months;3/13/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFirst Solar, Inc.(NASDAQ:FSLR) is having a rough go of it. FSLR stock has plummeted as much as 17% since reaching its February high of $38.50, and nowthe solar stock is being booted from theS&P 500.makeArticleAd();Source:U.S. Department of the Interior via FlickrYes, the residential solar installer recently beat Wall Street's fourth-quarter estimates on both the top and bottom lines, and raised its sales guidance for 2017.However, thanks to apre-tax charge of $729 millionduring the quarter, the company reversed last year's Q4 operating income of $131.82 million to a loss of $765.41 million. What's more, investors realized that even though First Solar did beat consensus estimates on the top line with $412.76 million, it still marked a year-over-year decline of 56% from revenue of $942.32 million a year ago.And yet, there's reason to believe FSLR stock could still put up huge gains before 2017 is through.Why the Trouble in First Solar?First Solar's business has been hurt by several factors, including weak economic concerns in China, resulting in slow on solar panel purchases and causing a rise in First Solar's inventory. This was one of the reasons competitors such asTesla, Inc.(NASDAQ:TSLA) opted to acquireSolarCity, shielding the latter from the negative effects of the industry.7 Blue-Chip Stocks Holding You BackAside from these factors, it hasn't helped that President Donald Trump - unlike former President Obama - hasn't embraced renewable or green energy to the extent he has supported the coal industry.Nevertheless, withSunPower Corporation(NASDAQ:SPWR) making some optimistic comments about the state of the solar industry, now's an ideal time to place a bet on FSLR stock, which closed Friday at $32.40, losing 6.4% for the week. At some point, solar energy - which continues to gain global acceptance as it decreases in costs - can't be avoided any longer.And this is where First Solar's restructuring efforts - including plans tocut about 27% of its workforce- make sense.FSLR, which has now beaten earnings estimates in seven straight quarters, sees 2017 net revenue in the range of $2.8 billion to $2.9 billion, which is above its prior range of $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion and higher than the $2.53 billion analyst were looking for. The upbeat revenue forecast means First Solar expects to realize revenue from - among others - the 250-megawatt Moapa project, near Las Vegas.Plus, the company is now diverting cash toward its Series 6 solar modules ahead of schedule to 2018, which offers significantly lower capex than Series 4, while abandoning plans for the Series 5 product. And while the Series 6 products offers more risk, First Solar's nearly $2 billion in cash on the balance sheet (or $19 in cash per share) gives it plenty of time to get it right.Bottom Line for FSLR StockAfter flaming out in 2016, losing some 51% of its value, there's still a lot to like with First Solar stock, which has fallen 56% from its 52-week high of $74.29.Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Android Smartphones Found With Pre-Installed MalwareAssuming the company can execute on its workforce reduction, lowering costs, while accelerating its Series 6 solar modules, FSLR stock could rebound above $50 in the next 12 to 18 months.

Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Android Smartphones Found With Pre-Installed Malware;3/13/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMalware made the leap from PCs to smartphones along with users. It's always been known that devices runningAlphabet Inc's(NASDAQ:GOOGL) Android operating system are much more susceptible to being infected thanApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhones. However, the situation may be even worse than we realized.makeArticleAd();Source: Check Point Software TechnologiesA mobile security research team posted on Friday that it scanned devices owned by two large companies and found Android malwarepre-installedon smartphones from 38 different manufacturers.That discovery should concern both corporate IT departments, and consumers. And it once again validates Apple's ""controlling"" iPhone approach.Android Malware Illustrates the Downside of Google's ApproachFrom the launch of the first iPhone in 2007, Apple retained full control of its iOS operating system and installed it only on its own hardware. Apps can only be downloaded from the App Store and these are checked and vetted by Apple engineers.7 Blue-Chip Stocks Holding You BackWith limited hardware configurations, Apple is able to test iOS thoroughly for all iPhone users. The company is aggressive about pushing out new iOS versions (79% of all iPhones are running iOS 10), and in the event of a security issue, it's able to quickly push out system updates to address it.With Android, GOOGL took a very different approach from Apple. It went wide open, licensing Android to dozens of different smartphone manufacturers. Users are free to tinker with the operating system and they can download apps from virtually anywhere - not just Google Play. This open approach helped Google to dominate the smartphone industry, with nine out of 10 new smartphones running Android.But the approach makes smartphone security a nightmare.Android updates often require manufacturer and/or carrier cooperation. As a result,only 2% of Android devices are running the latest version of Android, while the majority are running software that's at least several years out of date.Freedom to install questionable apps plus an older version of the operating system has let Android malware run rampant. At one point it was estimated to account for97% of all mobile malware.Check Point's Pre-Installed Android Malware DiscoveryCheck Point Software Technologies Ltd.(NASDAQ:CHKP), an IT security company, reported in aFriday blog postthat it had scanned the smartphones for two large companies (identified only as ""large telecommunications company"" and a ""multinational technology company"") and discovered Android malware had been pre-installed on smartphones from 38 different hardware manufacturers.Android malware identified ranged from adware to mobile ransomware capable of encrypting all data on the device until a fee is paid to unlock it. Some had been added to the smartphone ROM, meaning reinstalling Android would not remove it. And none of this malware was downloaded by users. The smartphones arrived at the two companies pre-infected, with installation happening ""somewhere along the supply chain.""Some of the most popularAndroid smartphones from 38 different manufacturers were infected, includingSamsung Electronics Co Ltd's(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) best-selling Galaxy S7. Also caught in the sweep was the Nexus 5 - anLGsmartphone co-developed with Google.The Nexus 5 is several years old, but the Android malware discovered on it had been there since the time of delivery.If a smartphone released in cooperation with Google itself is not immune from being infected before it even reaches the user, then Android's smartphone security issue is even bigger than previously thought.Apple's Long-Term AdvantageThis isn't the first time Android malware has made headlines. Last November, Check Point discovered a widespreadinfection of Android smartphones with HummingBad. This Chinese malware was found to have infected over 10 million Android smartphones worldwide.3 Stocks to Watch on Monday: Mobileye NV (MBLY), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) and Boeing Co (BA)And of course, there was the infamousWikiLeaks CIA dumplast week that shone a light on smartphone security and the tools used by government agencies to bypass it. Several dozen Android vulnerabilities were revealed, along with 14 iOS exploits.The difference is, Apple had addressed most of the iPhone issues in iOS 10, which has widespread adoption. Google may have patched Android, but chances are most Android smartphones out there won't get the update and will remain vulnerable. This latest Android malware discovery shows that the weakness to GOOGL's approach extends all the way to the supply chain. Even the most trusted manufacturers are not immune to having their smartphones compromised before the consumer even gets their hands on them.Google's wide-open Android approach has let it build a commanding 90% smartphone marketshare. But with Android malware increasingly in the spotlight and no easy solution in sight, the stage is set for Apple to press its advantage over GOOGL's approach.Apple built its iPhone empire around premium design, ease of use and plentiful apps. But its advantage in smartphone security may turn out to be the factor that lets it eat into Google's Android lead in the long term.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceTrade of the Day: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)An Apple Inc.

3 Great Reasons to Buy Amazon.com Stock;3/12/2017;"Behold, the awe-inspiring rise ofAmazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) stock:AMZNdata byYChartsmakeArticleAd();After the company's two decades of torrid growth, you'd be   excused for thinking its days of market-crushing gains are a   thing of the past. You'd also probably be wrong. In fact, here   are three reasons you may want to buy Amazon's shares today.Image source: Getty Images.1. 91.7%That's the percentage of U.S. retail sales conducted offline.   Said differently, e-commerce sales -- even after years of   staggering growth -- still comprise less than 10% of retail   sales.US E-Commerce Sales as Percent of Retail   Salesdata byYChartsResearch firm eMarketer estimates that global retail   e-commerce sales will increase to more than $4 trillion in 2020,   up from less than $2 trillion in 2016. With millions more people   gaining access to the internet every year, e-commerce appears set   to grow at a rapid pace for at least another decade, and probably   much longer. Amazon stands to benefit from this megatrend perhaps   more than any other company.2. Shopping = AmazonAmazon is growing increasingly synonymous with the word   ""shopping"" in the minds of consumers.Fifty-five percent of consumers begin their search on the   retail titan's website when shopping online in September -- up   from 44% a year earlier -- according to areport(opens a PDF) by marketing firm BloomReach. During that   time, the share of shoppers whose searches originated at all   other retailers' sites combined fell from 21% to only 16%.Amazon is also taking share from search engines. The   percentage of customers who began their product hunts on search   sites declined to 28% from 34%. These developments haven't   escaped the attention ofAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) subsidiary Google, which has named   Amazon itsNo. 1 competitor.This powerful trend is a testament to Amazon's increasingly   dominant consumer mindshare. Moreover, investors should expect   these figures to continue their ascent in the coming years, as   Amazon's competitors continue to struggle.3. Brick-and-mortar bloodbathIn addition to its retail search rankings, Amazon's dominance   can also be seen in its utter dismantling of traditional   retailers.After reporting weak holiday sales,J.C. Penney(NYSE: JCP)  recently announced that it will close 130 to   140 stores, which represents 13% to 14% of the struggling   retailer's current store base. J.C Penney Chairman and CEO Marvin   Ellison directly acknowledged that the growth of e-commerce was a   primary reason for the closures. ""We believe closing stores will   also allow us to adjust our business to effectively compete   against the growing threat of online retailers,"" Ellison   said.Another struggling retailer,Sears Holdings(NASDAQ: SHLD) , plans to close 150 Sears and Kmart stores in an   effort to cut $1 billion in costs in 2017. Sears has been   downsizing its store base and selling off many of itsmost valuable assetsin hopes of preserving liquidity and remaining solvent. But in   the face of plunging same-store sales, mounting losses, and   dwindling cash reserves, Sears Holdings' daysappear to be numbered.You can add to this list of besieged retailersMacy's,Kohl's,Abercrombie & Fitch,andOffice Depot-- all of which have closed stores in response to the relentless   onslaught of the Amazon.com-led e-commerce revolution. In doing   so, a clear picture emerges: Retailers of all types arelosing shareto the mighty Amazon -- and some may not survive.As its competitors fade away, Amazon stands to claim the   spoils. The online retail juggernaut is positioned to capture a   huge swath of the rapidly growing global e-commerce market as its   rivals crumble by the wayside. In turn, its stock should continue   to deliver handsome gains to shareholders in the years ahead.

In Part I, I discuss why it's now     increasingly clear that the human voice will become society's     next major computing interface, and why it will continue     proliferating through our homes and businesses. In Part II,     I'll dive deeper into the new and emerging business models. In     Part II, I'll discuss the various players involved in the race     to commercialize the technology -- those best-positioned to     profit today, those positioning themselves to thrive tomorrow,     and those dropping the ball entirely. I'll also dive deeper     into the fascinating business models voice computing will soon     enable, and how those models will evolve as the technology     continues to improve.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();For nearly 40 years, we've seen the computer evolve into an   indispensable accessory of Western society driven by three   powerful technologies that defined their eras and played a   monumental role for investors along the way.The personal computer gave many of us our first glimpse at the   digital world, normalizing the idea that such machines have a   place in our homes and everyday lives. The internet tapped us   into that world, offering us endless floods of information,   entertainment, and commerce around which we willingly began   shaping our civilization. And then the smartphone encouraged us   to take that digital world everywhere we go, leaving nothing but   a few taps on a touchscreen between us, our computers, and   constant immersion.Now, a fourth technology -- voice computing--is removing that last barrier.Reimagining the roles computers playImagine driving down the highway, coming home from work, and     without taking your hands off the wheel or hitting any buttons,     asking your car to turn up the heat in your house, preheat the     oven for dinner, and play your favorite album, all in the same     breath. Picture negotiating with a street vendor in Beijing,     having your phone translate the entire conversation between     Mandarin and English out loud, so you can haggle in real time.     Or how about a stuffed animal that can tell your daughter     interactive stories every night before bed, reshaping the     adventure at every twist and turn based on her responses and     reactions.These aren't hypothetical scenarios -- they're happening     right now.The human voice is well on its way to becoming the next     major medium we use to interact with computers, and as we'll     explore in this two-part series,voicecomputingis the burgeoning field of technology making it possible.     Already spanning multiple consumer and enterprise ventures     (think call center routing, digital dictation, or the virtual     assistants on smartphones), the industry's ultimate aim is     enabling people to carry on hands-free, conversational-style     interactions with computers.It's an ambitious prospect capable of significantly     expanding the roles computers play in our everyday lives, but     it's also one that appears inevitable when considering the     trajectory computers have taken, without fail, since their     introduction, evolving in shape and form around contemporary     technology to solve unmet needs.Image Source: Getty ImagesAnd yet voice computing's evolution is different. Unlike any     form of computing to come before it, the technology bypasses     the physical realm, allowing users to query the internet,     manage their surroundings, and connect to third-party services     without ever having to touch a physical device -- all in the     time it takes to form a sentence.If that sounds unnecessary, then consider just how limitless     the applications could be. From the surgeon who needs to     rapidly adjust the conditions of her operating room     mid-procedure, to the disabled veteran who simply hopes to     access the appliances in his home. The sheer number of everyday     applications for such a technology has prompted Grand View     Research to project the global market for voice recognition     technology will reach $128 billion annually by 2024, an     estimate that may undershoot the overall economic opportunity     at play considering the potential verticals include healthcare,     defense, entertainment, consumer goods, and more (I'll discuss     these in more detail in Part II).There is one thing we can be certain of, however. Voice     computing is extremely likely to transform the way we interact     with technology in society, but before that can happen, a     large-scale societal shift toward adopting the interface must     occur, a shift thatcannotoccur until several key hurdles are overcome.Understanding the challenges aheadTo analyze those obstacles, let's turn to the most       promising application of voice-driven technology today:       virtual digital assistants.Data Sources: Socratic Technologies, Vantiv, Statista.         Chart by AuthorThanks to the success of the iPhone andApple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) other devices, Siri is currently the most       wildly used virtual assistant in the United States, but until       recently, it's also perfectly exemplified what's holding       voice computing back. To put it simply, speaking with Siri       can often feel more like a novelty than a time-saver, a       sentiment shared not just among Apple users, but most       smartphone owners with access to similar voice computing       technology.It's a problem we can break down into three fundamental       hurdles.The first is that users must often resort to awkward       combinations of hyper-specific phrasing and hurried       robo-speak to have their speech accurately recognized. Andrew       Ng, chief scientist atBaidu(NASDAQ: BIDU) and one the most respected names in the field,       perhaps put it best in 2015 when he noted, ""Speech       recognition, depending on the circumstances, is say 95 per       cent accurate. So maybe it gets one word in 20 wrong. That's       really annoying if it gets one in 20 wrong and you probably       don't want to use it very often. That's probably where speech       recognition is today.""The second hurdle is that even when our speech iscorrectlyrecognized, there still remains a strong chance it will bemisinterpretedwhile undergoing natural language understanding, a process in       which the assistant attempts to comprehend what we want using       the sequence of words (and eventually, the tone, pace, and       inflection) we give. And even if that speech is correctly       understood, an assistant may still simply be unable to solve       for the request due to technical constraints. Examples of       both cases can be seen in the screenshot below, along with a       sense of how frustrating the encounter can be.Image Source: Author's iPhoneEncounters like these make us feel as though we're wasting       our time trusting our phones to do what we could have done       ourselves with only a little more effort upfront. Over time,       they build up, eventually discouraging us from even tryingto       use our assistants for anything complex, instead relying on       them only for the most trivial of tasks, like setting alarms       or creating reminders.Thankfully, these first two hurdles are solvable with data,   third-party partnerships, and time, each of which the major   players in this space have been actively accruing for years.   Returning to our example, since Siri was introduced to the world   in 2011, virtual assistants have grown far more capable of   correctly interpreting requests thanks to advances in deep   learning, a thriving field of AI being utilized byAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) ,Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) , Baidu, and others to improve speech recognition,   natural language understanding, and other components of voice   computing at astounding rates. (Click herefor an outstanding story byThe New York Timeson Google's significant role in making this happen).Equally as important, decisions by Apple and its competitors   to open their platforms up to third-party services have made   today's voice-based assistants feel far more capable than in   years past. These decisions allow Siri, for example, to call you   a ride using your Uber account, or order a pizza through your   storedDomino'sinformation -- not unlike anactualsecretary would do.As the potential behind voice computing becomes increasingly   obvious in the coming months and years, we should expect more and   more third parties to hop on board, eventually expanding the   scope of what a partnership could entail (instead of ordering an   Uber, imagine ordering a plane ticket). One look at the rate of   growth for third-party commands available on Amazon's voice-based   assistant, Alexa, can tell us a lot.Data Source: Voicebot. Chart by AuthorWith time, these technical achievements and partnerships will   continue compounding, eventually making for a highly practical   voice computing experience. Even marginal improvements in the   technology will convince users to begin using voice as an   interface more frequently. In the same talk regarding the current   state of the voice industry, Ng went on to say, ""I think that as   speech recognition accuracy goes from say 95 per cent to 98, 99   to 99.9, all of us in the room will go from barely using it   today, to using it all the time."" He added, ""Most people   underestimate the difference between 95 and 99 per cent ... 99   per cent is a game changer.""Although we're not yet able to predict when the technology   will reach that point, if the recent pace of progress is any   indication -- since Ng's speech, Baidu has built a program   capable of dictating English three times faster, and with 20%   less errors, than human beings -- it won't be much longer.In the meantime, an arguably far more important hurdle stands   in the way. It's a problem shared by every other major computing   medium in use today, only voice is actually solving for it.An instantaneous computing experienceNo matter the medium, we've always interacted with computers   by issuing commands. In the 1950s, we meticulously punched those   commands into cards before feeding them into hulking machines.   Now, technology allows us to simply type, click, and,   increasingly, speak them and expect a result.Yet despite these advancements, today's mediums still subject   users to a unique set of delays, a sort of friction that   inherently slows down the process betweenthinkinga command and actually being able tocommunicatethat command to your devices. A decade ago, that friction most   likely entailed tracking down a PC with internet, using the mouse   to open a browser, using the keyboard to run a search, and then   sorting for the result. But today, for most Americans, it simply   means reaching into our pockets for our phone, scrolling with our   thumb, and tapping away.It's a process so effortless, the average American now checks   their phone an estimated 46 times per day. It's even become   fashionable to argue there's no longerenoughfriction separating society from our devices; that we'retooplugged in to the digital world.So when you consider that voice computing's primary advantage   iseliminatingfriction, it becomes tempting to dismiss the technology as a   solution to a trivial problem. What that argument critically   fails to consider, however, is that friction is about more than   simple convenience, and that any amount of friction, no matter   how small, fundamentally limits the dynamic between a user and   their computing medium in two ways.Let's take the smartphone for example.Image Source: PixabayThe seemingly trivial motions we make when reaching for our   phone still require us to be in immediate proximity of the   device. We have to walk over to kitchen counter if we left our   phone there; we have to remember it's on the counter even before   we can do that. Then, once we've reached our phone, we're   required to physically handle it, a process that generally   requires we have one hand free and able.That may not sound like much, but these limitations force our   computing experience to revolve around the location of our   device, as opposed to it revolving around us.They can create roadblocks for those with disabilities affecting   their vision or hands (or really, even those who just have sticky   hands, wet hands, or their hands full), those far away from their   device, and most importantly, those with an immediate computing   need.There's a reason speech is our most instinctual form of   communication.If we have a question, and if we know those around us can   answer that question, we don't pull out our phone and run a   search, we open our mouths and ask. We do that because it's   instantaneous. Now contrast that with having to locate your   phone, having to type in your password, having to navigate to an   app, having to tap, type, or speak your command. These behaviors   are not instinctual,but we put up with them because the people around us usually   don't have the answers, and because smartphones are our best   alternative.But they don't have to be.The rise of voiceIt's not obvious quite yet, but today's physically bound   mediums have left a large hole to fill and voice computing is   starting to fill it.Over the past two years, the technology has begun manifesting   itself in the form of always-on, always-listening devices able to   virtually bypass the friction inherent in today's major computing   mediums. Currently, these devices are best exemplified by   Amazon's line of Echo smart speakers, which employ far-field   voice recognition technology allowing users to command Alexa from   across multiple rooms and through various background noises at   any time simply by calling for it out loud.Image Source: Amazon.com.Put another way, for as little as $50, Amazon's Echo is giving   consumers their first glimpse at a frictionless computing   experience. Following its initial setup, there's no pressing   buttons, no looking around for the device, and no navigating   through screens to issue a command. When it works correctly (like   Siri, Alexa is still very much in its infancy and subject to   misinterpreting commands) it really does allow users to convert   their thoughts to a command in the time it takes to form a   sentence, capturing the essential promise of voice as a   medium.And if the early estimated adoption rate for the device is any   indication -- Amazon hasn't officially released sales   figures, but as of January 2016, Consumer Intelligence Research   Partners (CIRP) estimates a staggering 8.2 million Echos have   already been sold in the U.S. (a number that pales in comparison   to Morgan Stanley's estimates of over 11 million), suggesting the   device has achieved well over 5% household penetration -- early   demand for a seamless computing experience is strong, and will   likely grow stronger as capable competitors race to introduce   their own offerings (see Google's Home,Nvidia's(NASDAQ: NVDA) Spot, or Baidu's Little Fish), and as voice   recognition, natural language understanding, and third-party   support continue improving at rapid pace.Data Sources: VoiceLabs, CIRP, KPCB, InfoScout. *2017     figures are VoiceLab projections. Chart by AuthorTo be clear, these devices will never replace today's existing   computing mediums, but will rather augment them. While   screens will remain the preferred medium for our more detailed   and visual computing needs, voice will begin its ascent by taking   on an increasing share of our more ""conversational"" demands,   common requests we want addressed with the immediacy we expect   from dialogue (""Cancel my doctor's appointment."" ""Pause that   music!"" ""What's a good non-fiction book to read on the beach? ...   Great, order that one."")As the technology grows capable of handling increasingly   nuanced and complex requests, and as voice-enabled devices   proliferate and evolve, we can expect more users to grow   comfortable engaging with the technology around the home, in the   workplace, and gradually more pervasive aspects of society.Andthat'swhere the real opportunities begin.The opportunity at handSome of the biggest tech empires in modern history have been   built around the personal computer, internet, and smartphone,   each of which has provided the infrastructure for technology to   penetrate deeper and more reflexively into everyday life,   allowing creative companies to reach consumers in entirely new   ways.In just 10 years, the iPhone helped Apple grow to become the   largest corporation in the world, but it also popularized   smartphone technology in the U.S., helping to create the   infrastructure that in turn enabledFacebook(NASDAQ: FB) ,Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) , Alphabet, Uber,Snap, Amazon,Shopify(NYSE: SHOP) , and countless others to create businesses that   reach deeper into our lives than any before.Image Source: Author's iPhoneAnd yet voice technology is going deeper.It's becoming an invisible, always-listening medium that   surrounds us, weaving itself more seamlessly into the fabric of   our lives than any before it. It's called on using our most   instinctual, reflexive form of communication, and it's accessible   in the time it takes to form words. It's a technology that   provides tomorrow's innovators a far more intimate and pervasive   way to help us satisfy our digital wants.It's a startling but increasingly inevitable reality for both   investors and society.In Part II: The Playing Field, I'll discuss various players   involved in the race to commercialize voice computing.

The 5 Biggest Challenges to the Driverless Car Revolution;3/11/2017;"The year 2017 is gearing up to be a momentous year for the   driverless car race. But despite major initiatives by   megacorporationsAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) ,Tesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) , and others, there are major road blocks ahead   for the driverless car revolution. A recentMcKinseyreport highlights five of them.1. PricingNo matter how incredible an innovation might be, it's useless   if it's not affordable. Although Alphabet's Waymo has clocked   more than 2 million road miles in its autonomous vehicles,   McKinsey estimates that self-driving cars are ""unlikely to be   available before 2020."" Alphabet and others are inching closer to   commercializing their products. A partnership withFiat Chrysler Automobiles NV(NYSE: FCAU) will, for the first time, take Alphabet's autonomous   driving technology out of its peculiar ""panda car"" and into 100   Pacifica Hybrid minivans in early 2017. But those minivans aren't   for sale, and, if they were, would probably cost magnitudes more   than an average minivan.2. Consumer UnderstandingmakeArticleAd();Video source: Waymo viaYouTubeEven if driverless cars become affordable, no one will buy   them if they don't understand them. That means that self-driving   car companies need to educate consumers on the advantages of   autonomous vehicles. Informational videos like the one above   produced by Alphabet's Waymo are an important start, and others   like Tesla Motors are producing their ownvideo vignettesto make self-driving cars salient. Tesla Motors and others have a   clear business incentive to make self-driving seem mainstream,   and the more that their message is spread, the brighter the   future for their sales and sustainability.3. Safety/Security issuesConsumer understanding goes hand in hand with a major concern   about autonomous technology -- safety and security. At no point   was this clearer than in May 2016, when Tesla Motors reported the   first driver fatality while its Autopilot technology was engaged.   The tragic crash occurred when neither the driver nor Tesla   Motors' technology recognized a truck's white-colored trailer   crossing its path on a highway. There will certainly be more   tragedies in the future of autonomous vehicles, and it will   remain a continuing challenge and the highest priority for   self-driving car companies to minimize safety and security   issues. However, it's also important to remember that these   high-profile cases can cause over-reactions, and sticking to   statistics can help investors, companies, and consumers alike   identify the best autonomous option for investing, manufacturing,   and purchasing.4 & 5: Regulation and TechnologyAs with all new innovations, regulation and technology can   make or break a revolution. The McKinsey report is quick to note   that regulation is a hurdle, rather than a never-ending issue. It   makes sense, then, that Ford, Alphabet, Lyft, Uber, and Volvo   Cars have all joined together to create the ""Self-Driving Coalition for Safer Streets."" Rather than rally for ""wild west"" free market competition,   these companies want to see a sensible framework of standardized   regulation upon which they can confidently build their new   business units.Technology isn't a hurdle, but there is a minimum threshold   below which driverless cars will never be the norm. Companies   like Alphabet's Waymo and Tesla Motors are aiming for full   autonomy, while others are taking the more step-wise approach of   offering semi-autonomous additions like Audi's ""Traffic Jam   Assist."" The McKinsey report estimates that, once regulation and   technology issues have been resolved, ""up to 15 percent of new   cars sold in 2030 could be fully autonomous.""Hit the brakes?Image Source: Getty Images.2017 will not be the year self-driving cars take over our   roads. Pricing, consumer understanding, safety/security,   regulation, and technology issues will continue to impede this   industry's revolution. But Alphabet, Tesla Motors, and others are   making steady gains on addressing these issues, and the ultimate   widespread adoption of autonomous technology is almost   inarguable. Forward-looking investors with long-term horizons   should acknowledge these issues, select their self-driving stocks   accordingly, and sit back to enjoy this multi-year market road   trip.10 stocks we like better than Wal-MartWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock     tip, it can pay to listen.

What Snap Inc Wants From Drones;3/10/2017;"Recently public social media companySnap(NYSE: SNAP)  has been making a few head-scratcher decisions with their marketing strategies lately, not the least of which is its growing interest in drone technology. While it makes sense for companies likeAppleandGoogle(NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG)  to pour money into moonshot technology projects, it's a bit more of a confusing move for Snap to make.In this clip fromIndustry Focus: Tech, tech sector bureau chief Dylan Lewis and contributor Evan Niu talk about what Snap might possibly want from their investment in drones, a few reasons why putting so much money and time into drones is probably ill-advised, and more.makeArticleAd();A full transcript follows the video.10 stocks we like better than GoProWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade,Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has tripled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy right now... and GoPro wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.Click hereto learn about these picks!*Stock Advisor returns as of February 6, 2017This podcast was recorded on March 3, 2017.Dylan Lewis:The next piece of news we're going to talk about is even more bizarre. According to reports fromThe New York Times, the company had other hardware ambitions, namely drones. At the moment, details are scarce, but several anonymous sources at the company confirmed Snap has been pursuing a drone camera project. I guess the thought here is, drones would allow aerial Snaps, it would allow people to capture video and images in a more novel way and a cool landscape way. Again, this seems kind of crazy to me, for this to be the focus.Evan Niu:[laughs] Yeah. It makes no sense to me. As ridiculous as the Spectacle thing is, trying to brand a company around those, the drone thing also makes no sense to me. It's hard to imagine someone buying a drone. First of all, it's hard to imagine Snap coming out with a drone that is competitive with what's already out there from DJI and evenGoPro. Look at even GoPro trying to get into drones -- they've had a lot of trouble. A company like GoPro that had experience making cameras still has trouble making a really compelling drone that has all the full features that people expect nowadays.Lewis:They famously had to recall one of their products, because they were having trouble with it.Niu:Yeah, because the battery was loose. If you shook it, the battery would move by a millimeter and the contacts would lose power, which is a really simple and kind of embarrassing problem. It was such a silly little mistake, and it probably had something to do with their manufacturing or something, I don't know. But yeah, the point being, GoPro hasn't really pulled off the drone thing very well either. And they were probably much better-positioned to make that kind of jump in the first place. And, of course, this is just a report that they're working on. Who knows if they actually do it. I hope they realize that it's a bad idea, and probably save everyone a bunch of headaches if they just don't do it at all. I mean, I guess it's not surprising that they have looked into it, since they want to become a camera company. But whether or not they actually do it, I think the chances are probably against it. I would hope so.Lewis:Yeah. I get that, it's tempting to be a tech company and have these really sexy side project. You see the stuff that Alphabet has done with Google's self-driving cars. That is so far afield from their core search property. Even getting into virtual reality on the hardware side with Oculus. But, you look at those two companies, those are businesses that have a cash cow underlying all of these futuristic R&D projects. Their core platforms, their ad-selling platforms are doing wonders for them, and are allowing them to throw money off on the side, and see what happens with these more futuristic, hard-to-pin-down-what-the-impact-might-be type projects. I think with Snap right now, there's a little bit of a focus concern on my end, because you haven't really figured out your core platform yet, you haven't monetized it really well. You're still rolling ads into it and building it into the user experience. And, you have like 3% quarter-to-quarter user growth. You have so many issues with what should be your core focus, I'm not really sure why they're doubling down on their hardware initiatives, if this is something they're really spending a lot of time on.Niu:That's a good point, I agree completely. Why aren't they focusing on getting the core business up and running in a good way? They're just now really rolling out these ads. Of course, in advertising, your ability to target ads is really critical in delivering value to your advertisers, who are the actual customers. That's who pays you.Facebookdoes a really good job with ad targeting because they have so much of your data.Twitter, I think, has had some troubles, which is partially why they're not monetizing as well as they should be. So, I guess the question is, how much user data can Snap really get, and how valuable will that be? Most of the stuff you're putting on Snapchat disappears immediately. What kind of data can they gather that's going to be really useful to turn around and use for targeting? It's kind of the same thing with Twitter. A lot of times, people can view tweets publicly without having to sign in, which limits Twitter's ability to gather data on them, which is also why it's harder for them to monetize their users. It's a big question on execution going forward, how they can really grow this ad business. If they can, this will do well. They are very new to this.Lewis:Yeah, it's something that I think they really have to figure out still. You look at the data points that Facebook and Google have on their users, and you're right, it's totally different, the profile is so robust for what people have on their Facebook. They know all my interests, they know everything I like, and they're able to incorporate that into the algorithms they're using to feed stuff up to me. Google knows exactly what you're searching for, and can serve up hyper-relevant stuff. With Snap, they know your friends, they know your demographic, and maybe they know some of the outlets that you're typically interested in on the story side. But I think they still need to do a ton to figure that out, and I'd rather see them doubling down there than going further afield with some of these hardware projects.Niu:Yeah. The big emphasis on hardware in general is confounding to me. I don't understand why they're doing it, or why they're trying to make this pivot -- if you want to call it a pivot. They should just get down to working on their actual ad platform, focus on the software-as-a-service stuff, before they really start dabbling in this hardware stuff. Hardware is hard.Lewis:And the way that their hardware is set up, too, their Spectacles are built-in to integrate with Snapchat. They're not really a device that you can use across platforms.Niu:Well, you can export, and it exports in a circular format as opposed to the square format that most people see. So, there is a way that you can export content that you take on Spectacles. But, yeah, the point is, you would think they would want to tie exclusively to the platform. But then, it's like, why would you buy some product that's only available for this platform? Conversely, if it's not a good product, if it works on all platforms, why would you buy it unless it's the best product out there? It's this really weird Catch 22. Imagine, would you buy a product that could only submit stuff to Facebook? It doesn't make any sense. But that would be the differentiating factor. But yeah, their whole strategy makes no sense to me.Lewis:Yeah, it seems a little backwards. The point that I was going to make is just, the biggest salesman for the hardware stuff is going to be people being on the platform in general. The addressable market for those products is going to be whatever the user base that they have is. Right now, it's around 160 million daily active users. The most compelling way to make that hardware business look appetizing is to continue to grow that user base, then maybe you have people that want something that's a little bit more dedicated. I'm still skeptical of that.

Sears Holdings Corp (SHLD) Soars Amid Potential for More Closings;3/10/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSears Holdings Corp(NASDAQ:SHLD) shares were up by double digits on Friday amid what appears to be optimism over the possibility of more store closures prompting a short squeeze in SHLD stock.makeArticleAd();Source:Mike Mozart via FlickrSears is coming off afourth-quarter beat on the top and bottom lines, but with still-horrid numbers. Revenues in Q4 were down more than 16% to $6.1 billion, and the company lost $607 million.Nonetheless, SHLD stock rebounded by 7%-plus Thursday, and now is up another 15% on Friday.Business Insider's Hayley Peterson writes that the company's conference call points to thepossibility of more store closings and sales. CFO Jason Hollar said:""We have a valuable real estate portfolio, which at the end of the fourth quarter comprised 1,050 leases with significant optionality, as well as 380 owned stores, many in prominent locations. We will continue to assess opportunities to right-size our store footprint and inventory levels aligned to our ongoing transformation to an asset-light integrated retail model.""Hayley surmises that ""By highlighting the leases with optionality, Hollar seems to be suggesting the point that Sears can find ways to either partially or entirely get out of those leases before they expire. Meanwhile, the owned stores can be sold for cash.""3 Short Squeeze Stocks That Are Ready to Fly MUCH HigherSHLD has knocked its store count down by nearly 600 stores over the past five years as it tries to repay debt amid a failure to turn around the core business.The short-term optimism in SHLD stock appears to be scaring what is an overwhelmingly bearish crowd. Roughly 84% of Sears' float was sold short as of the most recent data, good for a short ratio of 8.52 - basically, it would take more than eight days' worth of selling at average volumes to clear out all the bearish bets on SHLD.As of this writing, Robert Martin did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceSnap Inc (SNAP) Stock Is the Perfect Buy at This PriceHow to Trade Apple Inc.

Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Is More Expensive Than Alphabet Inc (GOOGL);3/10/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIt's not by much, but it's there.Alphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL), the parent of Google, was valued at 30.35 times last year's earnings as the market opened March 10.Microsoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT), the parent of Windows, was valued at 30.48 times earnings.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockSeen solely through the prism of financial reports, this makes no sense. Microsoft revenue for its fiscal 2016 was its lowest in three years. Alphabet's margins remain superior and its top line was up 20% in 2016 - ""The Google"" recorded more revenues than ""Mister Softy"" for its most recent fiscal year.Why all the investor love for MSFT stock?Credit the transformation engineered by CEO Satya Nadella, and a new enterprise buying cycle. Simply put, the cloud is where the action is, and Microsoft has essentially becomeInternational Business Machines Corp.(NYSE:IBM), the default choice for running cloud applications.Cloud App DominanceEnterprises - that is large businesses, governments and institutions - are finally moving to the cloud in the form of cloud applications. These include software used for collaboration, marketing, planning, human resources, and for information management.7 Future Blue-Chip Stocks You Need to BuyThe importance of this market, and its potential, can be seen in the recent action of IBM. Its revenues and margins improved dramatically during its most recent quarter, and the stock has risen 28% over the last year. IBM's price-to-earnings metric is still in the mid-teens, but if it can keep the top-line momentum growing when it reports next month, it could be a buy.Synergy Research writes this week, however, thatMicrosoft is leading the enterprise application charge. They are a leader in half the niches identified by the research company, the only cloud software firm identified in more than one area.The one area where GOOGL is even competitive, writes Synergy, is cloud collaboration, shared office applications like Microsoft Office 365 and, on Google's side, the G Suite. Microsoft took the overall market lead in the second quarter of last year and has not looked back.You can start to see the turn in the last few quarterly reports. MSFT revenues of $24.09 billion were up nearly 20% from the previous quarter's $20.45 billion, and more than 20% of that money hit the net income line. Alphabet had more revenue, $26.06 billion, but slightly less of that money fell to net income.Remember: What matters with stocks isn't what you did, but what you're doing, and what you can be expected to do. Expectations for MSFT stock are suddenly sky-high. Thus Microsoft's earnings are worth more.This week, Alphabet tried to halt that momentum at its Google Cloud Next event. How well it succeeded won't be known for some time, although it wasmaking big claims.That Google faces a challenge an enterprise challenge in cloud, however, is now undeniable. It's why the company did an ""acqui-hire"" of VMware co-founderDiane Greenein 2015, making her the head of Google Cloud in 2015, three years after joining the parent company's board.Experts Like BothInvestorPlacewriters are clued-in to the Microsoft momentum, which has the stock up 24% over the last year, outstripping Alphabet's 17% gain.Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

I have both, and believeGoogle still has unrealized potentialon the consumer side of the market. Serge Berger agrees.It's still the one, he writes.But it does mean you want to look closely at cloud applications for profits this year. It does mean that MSFT stock is no longer a client software play, but a cloud play, and that its best days may yet be ahead of it.Dana Blankenhornis a financial and technology journalist.

Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock Is MUCH More Than Ryzen;3/10/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe past couple of weeks have been … well, interesting ones forAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMD) shareholders. AMD stock, after more than quintupling over the course of the prior 12  months, fell 16% in just four days a week ago and has struggled to pick itself up off the mat in the meantime.makeArticleAd();Source:Matthew Rutledge via FlickrThe prod for the pullback? Reports that its new (and well-hyped) computer processor wasn't performing quite as well as expected once put to the test in real-world applications.As Ars Technica reviewer Mark Walton put it:""The [Ryzen] 1800X lags behind its Intel counterparts in gaming, regardless of whether it's running at the same clock speed or higher.""It was a real blow to optimistic investors, who had bid AMD stock up in a big way on hopes that the new CPU would be the centerpiece of a turnaround story. Now that story is in question.Thing is, the Ryzen may not be as central to the company's rebound as it's been made it to be. Indeed, Advanced Micro Devices has a lot more going for it besides the new CPU that investors aren't giving it credit for. Three specific items come to mind. Note than a handful of AMD's competitors are now becoming partners.3 Things AMD Still Has Going For ItWhile investors had high expectations for Ryzen, the future for Advanced Micro Devices isn't dependent on it. In fact, there are three other areas that may end up meaning even more for its top and bottom lines.9 Stocks to Buy That Are Growing Faster Than AmazonIn no particular order …Penetrating the Cloud Market:While AMD has always had a presence in most key tech markets, cloud computing was never a key one for the company. That's changing now though… a ball that got rolling just in the past few weeks. In November,Alphabet Inc's(NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google division tapped AMD,looking to add its graphical processor units to Google's machine learning architecture.It's a curious development, as GPU chips weren't designed to do anything more than handle a computer's display screen. As it turns out, though, its GPUs are very capable of parallel computing, which is a critical aspect of this new cloud-based function.In the meantime,Microsoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) selected AMD processors to power its next-generation open course cloud platform.At stake is a piece of the cloud infrastructure market worth an estimated $300 billion per year.More Licensing Revenue:It's only an unconfirmed rumor thus far, but a reasonably credible one. That is,Intel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) is reportedly interested in using AMDs Radeon graphics technology to power Intel's integrated GPUs in future computers … displacingNvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA). The agreement between Nvidia and Intel ends at the end of March.At the very least, the prospect of such an IP licensing deal could mean a couple hundred million dollars in annual high-margin revenue. If Intel really wants to step up its game, though, it could help fund improvements in the way its CPUs handle graphics.New GPUs Will Enhance New CPU Revenue:While the reviews for the new Ryzen processor have been mixed, AMD stock holders should bear in mind that they're only half the next generation of hardware for Advanced Micro Devices.The other half of the one-two punch combination for AMD this year is the new Vega GPU, which should be unveiled around the middle of this year.As was noted back on Feb. 7:""Vega, is a second-generation high bandwidth memory (or HBM2) design found on a stacked-memory architecture that performs significantly better than the more common GDDR5 (double data rate type-five) utilized by most graphics processing units today. An essentially-infinite amount of memory can be dedicated to handling the display - the maximum virtualization is capped at a ridiculous 512 terabytes. This platform is about twice as powerful as most current alternatives, and will make Advanced Micro Devices competitive with the newest generation of GPU architecture from Nvidia, called Pascal.""More important, Vega was largely built with the Ryzen processor in mend, with each getting the most performance out of one another.Snap Inc (SNAP) Stock Is the Perfect Buy at This PriceIn the meantime, it's not like the Ryzen CPU is a lost cause.As the company's CEO Lisa Su recently explained, ""We hear people on wanting to see improved 1080p performance and we fully expect that Ryzen performance in 1080p will only get better as developers get more time with 'Zen.' We have over 300+ developers now working with 'Zen' and several of the developers for Ashes of Singularity and Total [War:] Warhammer are actively optimizing now.""Bottom Line for AMD StockAs encouraging as the future may be for the company whether or not Ryzen ends up performing well, there's still no denying that AMD stock is overbought and ripe for some profit-taking; that 16% dip is nothing compared to 2016's huge rally.But don't confuse any future weakness from AMD as evidence of what's in store, results-wise, from the company. Advanced Micro Devices is very well positioned for a great 2017. The trick is just being patient enough to wait for a truly palatable entry price. That could still be well below the recent low.In other words, you don't want to step into AMD stock for the long haul until it's almost uncomfortable to do so. We aren't there yet.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace3 Reasons Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

Why Excluding Snap From the S&P 500 Is a Big Deal;3/9/2017;"Snap's(NYSE: SNAP) decision to issue non-voting shares through its   IPO may already have cost it billions of dollars in investor   support.A group of institutional investors have approached stock index   providers S&P Dow Jones Indices and MSCI to bar the shares   from becoming part of several major indexes. Their argument is   that one of the criteria for inclusion in the indexes is ""a   corporate governance structure consistent with U.S. practice.""   Snap's corporate structure is quite unusual, with the founders   holding about 90% of the voting rights, and average investors   holding no votes at all.Excluding Snap shares from the S&P 500 may not sound like   a big deal -- it doesn't affect the underlying fundamentals of   the company. But the growing popularity of index funds and ETFs   means Snap will miss out on billions of dollars of buyer support   that early investors may have been expecting down the road.makeArticleAd();Image source: Spectacles.com.$6 trillion and growingIndex funds and ETFs are expected to overtake actively managed   investments in the next seven years or so, according to Moody's.   Currently, investors have plowed $6 trillion in assets into the   passive investments. $2 trillion of those assets track the   S&P 500 index.Getting added to the S&P 500 is a big deal. WhenAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) was added to the S&P 500, it   received an immediate 7% bump in its share price.Facebook(NASDAQ: FB) received a 4% boost upon the news that it would have   a place in the index.What's more, the stocks continued to benefit for some time as   active funds that are benchmarked against the index were   compelled to buy more shares of the heavily weighted stocks.   Alphabet and Facebook are two of the largest companies in the   S&P 500. Snap, with its market cap floating around $30   billion, would be more moderately weighted than both, but it   would still see similar benefits.Snap knew this was a possibilityIn Snap's S-1 filing with the SEC, it wrote that it couldn't   predict whether its decision to make its Class A shares   non-voting ""will result in adverse publicity or other adverse   consequences."" Certainly, it saw it as a possibility, and it even   noted that no other company has made an IPO with non-voting   shares.While Snap's capital structure is different from those of most   U.S. companies, it's worth noting that it's not the only company   with non-voting shares. In fact, Alphabet has two publicly traded   share classes -- one voting and one non-voting -- and it's   included in the S&P 500. Likewise, Facebook plans to issue   two non-voting (Class C) shares to current shareholders of any   class under its approved stock split plan.But the fact that investors cannot buy voting shares of Snap   on the open market makes its situation unique.How will it impact investors?While having buyer support in the form of institutional   investors is a nice insurance policy, it's not the only thing   that matters. After all, the primary driver of a stock's value is   the underlying company's performance. If Snap can continue   growing its user base and revenue at a rapid clip, the share   price should inevitably climb to meet its fundamental   performance.There are a lot of question marks surrounding Snap, especially   in light of the recent slowdown in user growth seemingly brought   on by the increased intensity of Facebook's competition. The   potential for several major indexes to exclude the stock make it   even riskier.10 stocks we like better than Snap Inc.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

"Get Your ""MPA"" in Deep Learning";3/9/2017;"Big happenings in AI land recently as new supercomputers get built and Einstein meets Watson. Both events were announced on March 6, 2017 and old Big Blue,IBM, finds itself at the center of all of this, still as relevant as the day Deep Blue beat Garry Kasparov in 1996.The supercomputer comes from Fujitsu who is using 24NVIDIA (NVDA)DGX-1 AI systems to help build a supercomputer for RIKEN, Japan's largest comprehensive research institution, for deep learning research. Scheduled to go online in April 2017, the RIKEN Center for Advanced Intelligence Project will use the new system as a platform to accelerate R&D into AI technology.The largest customer installation of DGX-1 systems to date, the supercomputer will accelerate the application of AI to solve complex challenges in healthcare, manufacturing and public safety.""DGX-1 is like a time-machine for AI researchers,"" said Jen-Hsun Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. ""Enterprises, research centers and universities worldwide are adopting DGX-1 to ride the wave of deep learning - the technology breakthrough at the center of the AI revolution.""According to the NVIDIA blog post on this news…""Conventional HPC (High-Performance Computing) architectures are proving too costly and inefficient for meeting the needs of AI researchers. So companies like Fujitsu and customers like RIKEN are looking for GPU-based solutions that reduce cost and power consumption while increasing performance. Each DGX-1 combines the power of eight NVIDIA Tesla P100 GPUs with an integrated software stack optimized for deep learning frameworks, delivering the performance of 250 conventional x86 servers.""In the video that accompanies this article, I share some simple graphics from NVIDIA that explain how GPU (graphics processing unit) semiconductors work.In the video, I also explain the IBM-NVDA connection as the two have been working together for several years on building HPC architectures and in November announced collaboration on a new deep learning tool ""to help train computers to think and learn in more human-like ways at a faster pace.""Einstein Taps Watson's BrainThe second story revolving around IBM, involvedSalesforce (CRM), who was the talk of the town this week.First, Jim Cramer was talking early in the day on March 6 during CRM's presentation at the Raymond James Institutional Investors Conference and he had a directive forAlphabet (GOOGL):Better buy CRM since nothing else is comparably affordable in embedded enterprise SaaS!Here was the story from StreetInsider.com, with arecap of their own similar call 5 weeks ago...Salesforce.com shares are now trading in positive territory following a mention by Jim Cramer earlier saying that Alphabet needs to by Salesforce.com. This follows a Street Insider post back in January where we wrote ""It would appear reasonably obvious that Alphabet would over pay forFacebook (FB), struggle to buyoutAmazon (AMZN), leaving the rumor-popular Salesforce as the next candidate. Alphabet did not buyback any stock in 2016, likely shoring up capital for a Salesforce purchase. Given that Microsoft, a leading rumored contender for Salesforce, bought LinkedIn, it appears that Alphabet is on the prowl for Salesforce.""Now today, on CNBC during a segment on Unusual Option Activity, at the 1:40 mark Jim Cramer goes on about what Google needs (emphasis ours): ""I think Alphabet, Google, needs very much to get away from a model that is advertising based. People feel they are trapped in it. That's why they're doing Waymo, autonomous cars, which is going very very well. It's why they're doing data-center work, the $400 million thatSNAP (SNAP)is paying them. But if you want to own the enterprise, OK you want to own it, you just BUY SALESFORCE. You take $80 billion and you buy it. Does Marc Benioff want to sell with the beautiful new tower coming and loving the independence of it? They have a close relationship. I think it's up to Benioff if he wants to sell but I do think that Alphabet NEEDS BENIOFF! NEEDS SALESFORCE to get a higher price to earnings multiple.""Then, after the close, Ginni and Marc got together (from the press release)...IBM and Salesforce today announced a global strategic partnership to deliver joint solutions designed to leverage artificial intelligence and enable companies to make smarter decisions, faster than ever before. With the partnership, IBM Watson, the leading AI platform for business, and Salesforce Einstein, AI that powers the world's #1 CRM, will seamlessly connect to enable an entirely new level of intelligent customer engagement across sales, service, marketing, commerce and more. IBM is also strategically investing in its Global Business Services capabilities for Salesforce with a new practice to help clients rapidly deploy the combined IBM Watson and Salesforce Einstein capabilities.The partnership will bring new insights from Watson directly into the Salesforce Intelligent Customer Success Platform, combining deep customer insights from Salesforce Einstein with Watson's structured and unstructured data across many sources and industries including weather, healthcare, financial services and retail. Together, Watson and Einstein will ingest, reason over and derive recommendations to accelerate decision making and drive greater customer success.Comments on the News: ""Within a few years, every major decision-personal or business-will be made with the help of AI and cognitive technologies,"" said Ginni Rometty, chairman, president and chief executive officer, IBM. ""This year we expect Watson will touch one billion people-through everything from oncology and retail to tax preparation and cars. Now, with today's announcement, the power of Watson will serve the millions of Salesforce and Einstein customers and developers to provide an unprecedented understanding of customers.""""The combination of Einstein and Watson will make businesses smarter and our customers more successful,"" said Marc Benioff, chairman and CEO, Salesforce. ""I'm thrilled to form an alliance with IBM-no company's core values are as close to Salesforce's as IBM's. It's the best of both worlds.""This is a huge move by both companies!In the after-hours session on March 6, CRM shares hit a new 52-week high above $85. We have yet to see bullish investors able push it back there since, even as Wall Street investment banks raise their price targets, with Morgan Stanley now at $107, Wedbush at $102, and Cowen and Stifel at $100.But the story is clear: GOOGL is now farther away from doing anything with CRM.And IBM is certainly closer, though that is probably a distant reality this year.In any case, the investment case for CRM was sound last week and just got a lot sweeter this week.And the case for owing NVDA shares below in the $90's is ever sound.To learn more about the ""massively parallel architecture"" that runs NVIDIA processors and IBM supercomputers, check out my video attached to this article.

And an increasing number of larger   businesses are utilizing Mindbody's more extensive -- and   higher-priced -- packages. In this way, Mindbody is able to scale   its business along with the success of its customers.More than 60,000 businesses have turned to Mindbody's platform   for these solutions. That's up from less than 34,000 subscribers   in the first quarter of 2014. During this time, Mindbody's   revenue has nearly doubled from $70 million in 2014 to $139   million last year.Still, Mindbody isnot yet profitable, which is likely why its stock is currently trading for around   $27; properly valuing early-stage growth companies can be   difficult. But at that price, Mindbody's current $1.1 billion   market cap drastically understates its market potential. The   60,000 businesses Mindbody currently serves are just a tiny   fraction -- about 1.5% -- of the 4.2 million wellness businesses   that the company says exists around the world. And its $139   million in revenue is just a smidgeon of the $9.5billionthat Mindbody estimates as the current size of its addressable   market -- a market that itself is growing, as more people come to   understand the benefits of fitness and overall healthier living.   That's a massive untapped opportunity that could offer Mindbody   years -- and potentially even decades -- of strong growth.Mindbody's powerful network effects should allow it to capture   the lion's share of this immense market. Each new user expands   the base of potential customers for Mindbody's business clients,   and each business that joins Mindbody's platform increases the   number of wellness offerings that users can choose among. It's a   virtuous cycle that should continue to grow stronger as Mindbody   expands its user and subscriber counts in the coming years.To further strengthen its ecosystem, Mindbodyreached a dealwithUnder Armour(NYSE: UA) (NYSE: UAA) that lets the more than 180 million users   of Under Armour's MyFitnessPal app sign up for classes offered by   Mindbody's subscribers. Mindbody also has apartnership withAlphabet's Google(NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) allowing people in several major   cities to book classes listed on Mindbody directly through Google   Search and Maps. These two titans choosing to partner with   Mindbody is a major vote of confidence for its platform, and I   wouldn't be surprised if a company like Under Armour makes a bid   for Mindbody at some point in the future.All told, Mindbody is a leader in a huge and expanding   industry with the ability to grow its market share exponentially   in the years ahead. And at current prices, Mindbody offers   long-term investors a chance atmultibagger-type returnsin the coming decade. That makes this currently small-cap stock a   great buy today.10 stocks we like better than MindbodyWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Alphabet (GOOGL) Continues its Push into AI, Acquires Kaggle;3/9/2017;"Alphabet Inc.'sGOOGLGoogle announced the acquisition of Kaggle, an operator of data science and machine learning competition platform, at the Google Cloud Next conference in San Francisco.Founded in 2010, Kaggle's platform enables data scientists to conduct machine learning contests, host data sets and write and share codes. Over the years, Kaggle has become the world's largest data science community, leveraging on its early mover advantage and focusing on a niche market.Earlier this month, Google and Kaggle hosted a $100,000 machine learning competition around classifying YouTube videos.In recent times, Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning has helped Google in launching innovative products and services for multiple industries. Machine learning is also helping the company to overcome bigger challenges such as improving energy efficiency of data centers.We believe that continuous focus on innovation is likely to drive the Alphabet's stock price going ahead. The shares have appreciated 16.7% in the last one year compared with the ZacksInternet-Servicesindustry'sgain of 14.1%.Google Gearing Up Against Microsoft and AmazonWith more than 0.8 million data scientists on the platform, Kaggle opens up an opportunity for Google to broaden its reach within the data science community and be on an equal footing with Amazon'sAMZNAWS and Microsoft'sMSFTAzure that also offer data science services.As Alphabet generates significant cash from operations and also holds a huge cash balance, management has the flexibility to pursue growth in any area that exhibits true potential. It has the scale and resources to match up to its competitors.Buying Kaggle could also boost Google's recruiting efforts, giving it access to a large pool of scientists.Alphabet Inc. PE Ratio (TTM)Alphabet Inc. PE Ratio (TTM)|Alphabet Inc. QuoteKaggle Eyes Infrastructure, Scalability and Improved   ServicesAccording to Kaggle co-founder and chief executive Anthony Goldbloom, the acquisition will help Kaggle better serve its community with more powerful infrastructure, scalable training and deployment services and the capacity to store and query large data sets.The Kaggle team will join Google Cloud but operate as a distinct brand.To ConcludeGoogle's innovations outside the core search business include healthcare (partnership with Johnson & Johnson for the development of surgical robots), self-driving cars (partnership with Ford), cloud computing and drones, all being driven significantly by machine learning. We believe that the company has the financial muscle to overcome any short-term adverse conditions to continue pursuing these initiatives.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, Alphabet has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Is Betting BIG on Google Cloud in 2017;3/9/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsCloud services are a big business that is only getting bigger. When you think of the cloud, the one company that tends to immediately come to mind isAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) - if for no other reason than when its AWS cloud servers go down, half the internet seems to go with them. ButAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL) is betting big on the cloud too, and at its Next 2017 event, the company had some big announcements.makeArticleAd();Source: GoogleGoogle cloud is celebrating some much-needed wins, including new partners, a significant steal for G Suite and recognition for topping cloud providers in 2016 for reliability.Google Cloud Takes Aim at AWS, AzureThe public cloud is currently dominated by Amazon's AWS, withover 30% of the market- triple the footprint of second-placeMicrosoft Corporation's(NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure. Google cloud is in fourth place, trailingInternational Business Machines Corp.(NYSE:IBM).The cloud is a huge market already and it's expected to get far larger, quickly. Forrester recently pegged the expected value of the public cloud - services like AWS, Azure and Google Cloud - toreach $236 billion by 2020.9 Stocks to Buy That Are Growing Faster Than AmazonAnd Google wants a bigger piece of that pie.At its Next 2017 conference keynote, the company made the case for choosing Google cloud over AWS or Azure. While noting that it has invested $30 billion in its cloud services, the company rattled off an impressive list of companies that haverecently made the move to Google cloud.eBay Inc.(NASDAQ:EBAY) andColgate-Palmolive Company(NYSE:CL) represent the large corporate side of Google cloud's capabilities, while popular apps likePokemon GoandSnap Inc.'s(NYSE:SNAP) Snapchat show off its suitability for hosting consumer apps.Google cloud's head Diane Greene, took the opportunity to fire a shot at Amazon's AWS and the bad PR it's received for large-scale outages. Chances are, you were affected by anAWS issue at the end of Februarythat slowed or took down thousands of websites, apps and services for hours.Greene noted that Google cloud has been recognized for topping all cloud service providers in availability for 2016. She puts that availability level at 99.999% reliability, which is very impressive.It certainly makes a case for switching from AWS.Big Wins for Google Cloud, and G SuiteSeveral big wins for Google cloud were also touted at Next 2017.SAP SE (ADR)(NYSE:SAP) is the world leader in enterprise resource planning software, counting over 345,000 companies as customers. Many large corporations rely on SAP software and it's big enough to be hosting its own cloud services. However, it has signed on for its SAP HANA database to be hosted on Google cloud, instead of at its own data centers.AsTechCrunchnotes,Microsoft and Amazon already had deals signed with SAP. Beating AWS and Azure to host HANA has an even greater significance given that the competition already had an established relationship with SAP.Drop Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock. Here's Why.Also announced at Next 2017 was a big win for G Suite, Google's cloud-hosted productivity apps.Verizon Communications Inc.(NYSE:VZ) announced it has dropped Microsoft Office for 150,000 employees, moving them instead to Google's G Suite.Look for Google to continue aggressively pushing Google cloud services in 2017. The company has been spending big on ramping up its infrastructure, its ""Other"" revenue (which includes cloud revenue) wasup 62% in the last quarterand the majority of its 2,100 hires in Q4 went to cloud operations.As Google cloud's Diane Greene said onstage, ""I think 2017 will be a good year, too.""As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceApple Inc.

3 Value Stock Naked Puts to Make a Quick $1,000;3/9/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsI'm mostly a value stock investor. Value stocks offer greater returns over the long haul than growth stocks, and there is a greater margin of error should you choose poorly. One of the great things about value stocks and naked puts is that the latter allows you to potentially scale into a value stock position even if you aren't certain the stock has yet hit its bottom. If it has, naked puts are still of use.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockNaked puts that generate income like this are a cornerstone strategy of my forthcoming stock advisory newsletter,The Liberty Portfolio.By selling naked puts on a value stock, should the stock get put to you, you get it at an even better value than just buying shares outright. If you also nibble a little at the value stock, you are covered two ways in terms of getting into the stock.7 Cheap Dividend Stocks to Buy NowIf you aren't sure, naked puts allow you to hedge by collecting some premium income.Naked Puts on Value Stocks: Teva (TEVA)Source:Open Grid Scheduler (Modified)Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited Ltd (ADR)(NYSE:TEVA) is just such a potential play for naked puts and value stocks. TEVA is the largest generics company in the world, but it also develops and markets its own biologics, as well as biosimilars.The company has been hit with a wave of bad PR lately amid being sued in a price fixing case. What's more, Teva's also seen one of its top drugs go off-patent, is being investigated for bribery in Russia and its CEO has stepped down. But with shares at their lowest point in ten years, I think the selling is overdone.TEVA closed Wednesday at $32.80. My suggestion is to sell the 19 May $32.50 naked puts for $1.75. Sell three of them to collect $525. That's an incredible return of 5.3%, which you never see for a 67-day holding period, which also equates to about a 29% annualized return.Naked Puts on Value Stocks: BP (BP)Source:Mike Mozart via FlickrBP plc (ADR)(NYSE:BP) is another company that has an even worse, and ongoing, PR problem. Deepwater Horizon remains on in the zeitgeist, thanks also to the recent movie. While BP has been slammed with more than $62 billion in payments from this disaster, it's actual core operating business is doing better.Upstream production is now profitable after quite some time of losing money. It's making money now from the partnership withRosneft(OTCMKTS:OJSCY). But more to the point, it's a value play. BP's EV-Ebitda ratio sits at 8.6 right now. By comparison,Exxon Mobil Corporation(NYSE:XOM) is at 16.1,Chevron Corporation(NYSE:CVX) is at 18.5,Royal Dutch Shell plc(NYSE:RDS.A) is at 10.7 andConocoPhillips(NYSE:COP) is at 16.5.8 Energy Stocks in Peril as Crude Oil Breaks DownBP closed Wednesday at $33.35. You might consider selling the 19 May $33 naked puts for $1.20. If you sell three of them for $360, you have a total of $885 collected so far. You also have a 1% buffer before having the stock put to you.Naked Puts on Value Stocks: Alphabet (GOOGL)Source: ShutterstockFinally, it may come as a surprise but I considerAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) to be a value stock. Well, actually I consider it a GARP stock - growth at a reasonable price.To me, a GARP stock is a growth stock that trades at a value price. That's because, when you back out its net cash position, it trades at a very reasonable multiple compared to its growth rate. Add in a great free cash flow situation and a big brand name, and you have a great stock.As it is, GOOGL trades at $858.27. There are some very aggressive naked puts you can do here that may earn you a cool grand on one trade alone. But since we are just rounding out $1,000 worth of naked puts, and we only need $115, just sell the 19 May $705 naked puts for $130. If you get GOOGL put to you at that price, you'll be thrilled!Lawrence Meyers is the CEO of PDL Capital, and manager of the forthcomingLiberty Portfolio stock newsletter. As of this writing, has no position in any stock mentioned. He has 22 years' experience in the stock market, and has written more than 1,600 articles on investing.

The shares lost most of the gains thereafter and remained below the S&P 500, as they have been since the election.It's widely believed that Google won't have as strong a standing with this government as it had with the previous one, but not for lack of trying. Company executives have been visiting the White House, but Google's very public stand against many of President Trump's sentiments are expected to work against it.Google's results had been stellar in 2016. After the customary dip in the first quarter, both revenue and earnings rose consistently through the year, pulling share prices along... that is, until the election.Revenue strength has come from both the search business as well as new areas including hardware, Play and cloud. Management said on the last call that there was ""tremendous potential"" in these areas and enthused over ""continued development of non-advertising revenue streams for YouTube.""In that they were probably referring at least in part to YouTube TV, an expansion of the Google service that is better known for letting you watch thousands of hours of video from a seemingly endless stock.DetailsThe company has joined with all four major broadcast networks (CBS, ABC, NBC and Fox), so a family of six can stream live content from 40+ channels at $35 a month. The company will maintain separate accounts for each member although only three can stream at a time.The price indicates that YouTube is probably still in negotiations to add more channels in the few months until it launches in important U.S. cities like New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and Philadelphia. The company plans to expand gradually to other U.S. cities. International expansion plans weren't mentioned.Also, as far as channels are concerned, there are some important exclusions: HBO, CNN, PBS, the Cartoon Network, TNT, or Viacom channels such as Comedy Central, MTV and VH1, Nickelodeon, Scripps' Food Network and Home and Garden TV.But Google does offer you all the goodness of YouTube (and that includes YouTube Red for original content, if you are a subscriber). The YouTube TV app for Android/iOS also allows you to stream whatever you're viewing to Chromecast, so you can make use of the larger TV screen (built-in Chromecast TVs will also do the job). At some future date (the demo failed during this announcement), Google hopes that you will be able to tell your devices via Google Home or Cast to turn on what you want to see.The best part? It gives you a real DVR experience by allowing you to store an unlimited number of your recordings for up to nine months, quite unheard-of amongst its competitors like DirecTV Now, PlayStation Vue and Sling TV. The Vue allows you to save shows from some channels for up to 28 days while Sling TV is still testing a service that will allow you to save up to 100 hours of recordings.Is It a Good Deal?That depends.If you're into traditional TV, you would be spending $80-100 on it, while making do with long-term contracts. YouTube TV is a good deal that way because it comes for just $35, no strings attached while also allowing you mobility. Then again, if you like all the content that's still exclusive to PayTV, you may want to stick with your current subscription.If you're more of a netizen, you're already familiar with the ""skinny bundle"" concept, wherein the most-watched/popular channels are served at a lower price. Either way, there's plenty of choice.So YouTube, which still focuses on user experience more than profits and has the resources to go for the best content, may be more capable of delivering the superior experience.What's In It for Google/YouTube?YouTube has for long been the go-to destination for online video consumption although Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN-Free Report) , Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX-Free Report) and others also have their own thing. Now that it is getting into live TV streaming, it's also pitted against traditional operators like AT&T (NYSE:T-Free Report) with its DirecTV Now, DISH Networks (NASDAQ:DISH-Free Report) with its Sling TV and CBS with its All Access that are also turning to the Internet to protect their revenues. The market is very crowded, so prices are under pressure.But if data from GfK is to be relied upon, the portion of American homes subscribing to a Pay TV service has shrunk to 75% with a much smaller 6% using Apple TV-like devices to stream shows to a TV. Moreover, the number of TVs per home is declining while the number of homes without a TV is on the rise (U.S Energy Information Administration survey). According to Morningstar, Pay TV executives estimate that 10 million homes subscribe to broadband only and not TV.eMarketer estimates that YouTube's 180 million viewers generated $3 billion last year and Google recently announced that it surpassed a billion hours of daily viewership. TV ads reportedly generate $70 billion in revenues annually, so there's a fair chance that as consumer preference continues shifting to online channels, YouTube TV will allow Google to take its share of those dollars.About Zacks Equity ResearchZacks Equity Research provides the best of quantitative and qualitative analysis to help investors know what stocks to buy and which to sell for the long-term.Continuous coverage is provided for a universe of 1,150 publicly traded stocks.

10 Companies Set to Dominate the Next Decade;3/9/2017;"Image source: Getty Images.Any investor would love to get their hands on a crystal ball   and take a quick peek at what's going to happen over the next   decade. The problem is, those crystal balls are hard to come by,   so we all have to settle for looking at what companies are doing   right now -- and attempt to anticipate how that will help or hurt   them in the future.makeArticleAd();The good news is that therearecompanies positioning themselves for growth over the next decade,   and setting themselves up to dominate in their respective   markets. Take a look:Image source: Amazon.1. AmazonAmazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) has its hands in so many business it's hard to   keep up. For some companies, that degree of diversification can   proof more trouble than it's worth, but Amazon's has shown it can   sell everything from tablets to its Echo speaker, while   simultaneously creating award-winning television shows and   managing a massive online consumer goods marketplace, andstillhave business bandwidth to power some of the biggest websites   through its Amazon Web Services unit.The company's ability to diversify its businesses -- while   still tying many of them to its Prime service -- has given Amazon   a lead over its competitors that won't fade any time soon.Image source: Google.2. AlphabetWith a $581 billion market cap, Google parentAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) is a juggernaut of the technology   industry, yet it still innovates like a much smaller, scrappier   company. Alphabet may still earn most of its revenue -- 99% --   from Google, but that hasn't stopped it from making big bets on   thedriverless car marketand even moonshots like curing cancer.Among the more than 20 companies under the Alphabet umbrella,   there are units trying to secure major positions in the future of   transportation, artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and the   burgeoning Internet of Things. Add to that the company's mobile   dominance with its Android platform, and its new devices like the   Pixel Phone and Google Home and its crystal clear that Alphabet   will still be one of the most dominant tech giants a decade from   now.Image source: Facebook.3. FacebookEvery day, the world feels like it gets a little bit smaller   and slightly more connected, andFacebook(NASDAQ: FB) deserves at least partial credit for that. With more   than 1.86 billion users on the company's main platform, and more   growth coming in huge markets like India, Facebook shows no sign   of slowing down in the social media space.The company plans to have 5 billion users by 2030. Take a   minute and remember that we have 7 billion people on the planet   right now. That's a hefty goal, but if any company can do it it's   Facebook. Aside from its main Facebook platform, the company is   investing billions in connecting people around the world through   its WhatsApp, Instagram, Messenger, and is investing heavily in   building what CEO Mark Zuckerberg calls ""the next computing   platform"" -- virtual reality.Image source: Lockheed Martin.4. Lockheed MartinLockheed Martin(NYSE: LMT) has gotten some flak for the high price of its F-35   Lightning stealth fighter jet, as President Trump has so kindly   pointed out onTwitter. But despite the criticisms, the F-35 is poised to help Lockheed   Martin dominate the aerospace industry over the next decade.Consider that the F-35 is expected to be in service until 2070   and could bring in more than $1 trillion in revenue for the   company over that time span. Sure, Lockheed may further trim the   cost of the planes -- as it did recently, when it announced its   long-term efforts to reduce costs had cut the price on its next   batch of 90 planes by $700 million -- but with more than 50   years of revenues expect to come from this jet family, there's   little reason to be skeptical of Lockheed's dominance.Image source: Netflix.5. NetflixNot so long ago, the idea ofNetflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) being capable of creating original, award-winning   programming would have seemed absurd. But over the past few   years, the company has amassed a vast trove of original content   that has not only won over critics but also helped the company   win new customers. In fact, 57% of the streaming service's U.S.   subscribers say they signed up for because of its original   content.Netflix now boasts about 93.8 million subscribers in 190   countries, and it's still growing. The company faces rising   competition from Amazon's Prime video service, but says it plans   on investing $6 billion in original content this year, which   should help it fend off rivals. A decade from now, Netflix will   have the advantage of that much more original content production   under its belt, and more streaming experience than any of its   competitors.Image source: Disney.6. DisneyWalt Disney(NYSE: DIS) expanded its empire back in 2009 when it purchased   Marvel Studios for $4 billion, and followed that up with another   $4 billion purchase -- of Lucasfilm -- in 2012. Those two   entertainment land-grabs alone will provide huge catalysts for   the company over the next decade, as it reaps the benefits from   theStar Warsfranchise, Marvel movies, merchandise, licensing ... you get the   picture.Add to all of that the company's long list of theme parks,   cruise ships, resorts, and its Pixar Studios, and it's easy to   foresee Disney holding a powerful position the entertainment   business for years to come. The company will have to adapt to a   shifting pay-TV landscape, and adjust to how those changes will   impact the company's all-important ESPN networks. But investors   would be wise to remember that the company already has many   decades worth of strategy-shifting experience.Image source: GE.7. General ElectricGeneral Electric(NYSE: GE) has weathered more changes than most companies over   its 100-plus year history, and the conglomerate  recently   reinvented itself once again to benefit from the rapidly evolving   industrial and technological landscape.Consider that CEO Jeff Immelt said back in 2015 that his   company is ""on track to become a top 10 software company.""    Software may seem like a far cry from the engine turbines   and other industrial equipment GE is known for, but it's   anticipating the rise of the Industrial Internet of Things   (IIoT), in which equipment is connected to the Internet, collects   data, and then analyzes it, helping make companies and systems   more efficient. GE is already well on its way in this market, and   with the IIoT estimated to add $14.2 trillion to the global   economy by 2030, there's plenty of room for growth.Image source: Tesla.8. TeslaCompared to other U.S. automakers,Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) is still  in its infancy, but the electric   carmaker is quickly becoming key player in the space. Tesla   is preparing to launch its fourth vehicle, the Model 3, later   this year, and estimates that it will produce 500,000 cars   annually starting in 2018.That's not so impressive when compared to, say,Ford's 2.6 million U.S. vehicle sales last year. But Tesla is betting   that the future of passenger cars is electric, and it's building   out a vast network of supercharger stations across the U.S and   Europe to fuel them, has already built the   battery-making Gigafactory to help drive down vehicle costs,   and is a leader in the driverless car space. If electric and   self-driving vehicles are the future, then the next decade could   certainly be dominated by Tesla.Image source: Oracle.9. OracleOracle(NYSE: ORCL) is slowly shifting from a hardware-dominated sales   model to one that generates more recurring revenue from software   and services. Its cloud computing revenue was up 64% year over   year in its most recent quarter, and topped $1 billion for   the first time. Oracle is now the leading cloud computing   provider for companies that have 1,000 or more employees, and has   made major investments in the space with acquisitions such as   cloud provider NetSuite, which it picked up for a cool $9.3   billion.The shift away from hardware to software and services may have   been slow in coming for Oracle, but it's making up for lost time,   and betting that its current cloud investments will pay off over   the long term. Given its current position in the tech world, and   its rising power in cloud computing, you can bet Oracle will   maintain its position for years to come.Image source: Nike.10. NikeNo other company dominates the sports apparel world likeNike(NYSE: NKE) , and at this point, there's virtually no stopping   it. It has not only built one of the strongest brands on the   planet, but it also knows how to keep the momentum going.   Consider that the company's $93 billion market cap allows it do   things like sign a lifetime sponsorship deal with Lebron   James that's estimated to be worth up to $1 billion.But branding is only part of the company's staying power. Nike   has proved that it can continue innovating its product lines, and   it has 40-plus years of success in marketing them in the right   way. Others may sprint faster for a time to gain share in   the $320 billion athletic apparel market, but Nike is   running a marathon, and it's clear it trained harder and has more   stamina than any of its competitors.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Apple Inc. iPhone Grabs Even More Market Share;3/8/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWarren Buffett knew better than David Tepper when it came to buying or sellingApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) last quarter. The Oracle of Omaha kept buying Apple through and around its earnings report in January. Most investors expected further slowdown in iPhone sales, yet Apple's flagship iPhone wrangled even more market share to remain the most popular original equipment manufacturer in the U.S.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockThe data, courtesy ofcomScore MobiLens, compiles the three-month average ending in January, placing Apple in the No. 1 OEM spot and as the second-most popular smartphone platform - behindAlphabet Inc's(NASDAQ:GOOGL) Android, of course.Apple holds nearly 45% of the U.S. OEM market, and in a distant second isSamsung Electronics(OTCMKTS:SSNLF), with 28% of the market.Notably, Apple is one of the only companies to actually advance its market share from October through January, from 42.3% to 44.6%, for a 2.3% gain. Samsung's market share declined 2% from 30%, and much of that could be attributed to its exploding Galaxy Note 7 fiasco in late 2016.The only other company to see an increase?LG, which wafted up 0.7% to hold 10.3% of the market.Why Apple Inc.

Smartphone subscribers for Android phones declined 2%, from 55.2% to 53.2%, while Apple gained 2.3%, from 42.3% to 44.6%.

Why Alphabet and Microsoft Should Start Disclosing Cloud Revenue;3/8/2017;"Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) is currently hosting its Google   Cloud Next '17 developer conference, which kicked off earlier   today in San Francisco and runs through March 10. Speaking at the   event, Google CEO Sundar Pichai made it clear that he sees Google   Cloud as an incredibly important part of the search giant's   future, and not just one of the company's many side bets. ""To me,   Google Cloud is a natural extension of our mission to make the   world's information accessible and usable,"" Pichai said.The distinction is that while search helps regular users   access information, cloud computing infrastructure and the   related value-added services like analytics help the enterprise   organize and access their information. The cloud infrastructure   market is booming, growing 49% last year to $38.1 billion,   according to market researcher Canalys. It's expected to jump   another 46% this year to $55.8 billion. As the market grows, so,   too, does the impact on the financials of the major players:   Google Cloud,Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Azure, andAmazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) AWS.Google data center in Council Bluffs, Iowa. Image source:     Google.makeArticleAd();As such, the former two should start disclosing exactly how   much cloud revenue they're bringing in.Follow Amazon's leadI never thought I'd see the day when Amazon was leading the   way in investor transparency, given the e-commerce giant's   long-standing refusal to share various operating metrics that are   pertinent to investors. Yet, when it comes to AWS and cloud   revenue, Amazon is doing just that; Amazon started sharing AWS   financials in 2015. AWS revenue was $12.2 billion last year,   translating into $3.1 billion in operating income.Microsoft only discloses growth rates for Azure (up 93% last   quarter), but lacking a base number, that data point is less   meaningful. We do know that total revenue in Microsoft's   intelligent cloud segment, which includes Azure among other   offerings, was $6.9 billion last quarter, resulting in $2.4   billion in operating income. Lacking an official figure, JPMorgan   analysts estimate Azure revenue for all of 2016 was $2.7 billion,   which would make AWS nearly five times bigger.Google includes Google Cloud revenue within its Google other   revenues segment, which generated a hair over $10 billion in   sales in 2016. That also includes revenue from Google Play as   well as the company's growing hardware portfolio. One   particularly prominent Google Cloud customer that just went   public likely spent between $400 million to $450 million last   year, and is committed to $400 million per year for thenext five years, so there's that.Sharing is caringYou could reasonably argue that AWS is far more important to   Amazon than its peers' respective cloud businesses, though,   specifically since AWS is by far the market leaderandit's such a major contributor to profitability due to razor-thin   margins in the core e-commerce business. In contrast, Google and   Microsoft enjoy much higher gross margin, as they each specialize   in software and services.Still, the cloud infrastructure market is only going to become   increasingly important in the years ahead, and investors will   want to see the results from the three largest players to assess   each company's competitiveness. Google and Microsoft should start   sharing more, especially if it's as important as Pichai says it   is.10 stocks we like better than AlphabetWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

YouTube TV's Biggest Advantage;3/8/2017;"YouTube recently announced its plans to offer a live   television streaming service to compete with the likes of DirecTV   Now, PlayStation Vue, Sling TV, and more traditional pay-TV   operators. YouTube TV will include 40 live channels and will be   initially available in select markets.While YouTube TV is missing quite a few channels compared with   competing services, it has the potential to attract a lot of   attention from media companies in the future thanks to one huge   advantage over the competitors: Google, theAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) subsidiary and owner of YouTube,   is one of the best digital video advertisers in the world.Image source: YouTubemakeArticleAd();Disney already sees the value in digital streamingDisney(NYSE: DIS) CEO Bob Iger is actively trying to get his networks   into digital skinny bundles. Indeed, Disney's networks, including   ESPN, are available in the lowest-priced tiers of all of the   aforementioned streaming services.Importantly, Disney is not sacrificing any of its affiliate   fees to get its channels into those tiers. ""The per-channel fees,   which we are not getting too specific about, are commensurate   with what the fees are on the existing services,"" Iger said about   its deal with DirecTV Now.But there's an added benefit to going digital. ""Some of the   technology platforms will offer dynamic ad insertion. We think   that that has got some real potential for the company,"" Iger told   investors on the company's third-quarter earnings call last   year.Dynamic ad insertion allows media companies to serve targeted   ads to viewers instead of using the one-size-fits-all system of   traditional live broadcasts. YouTube TV may give media companies   the opportunity to tap into Google's targeting data. On top of   that, YouTube already has millions of advertisers on its   platform, which it could tap for more premium YouTube TV ads.Media companies might give YouTube TV a bigger break on   affiliate fees if it can produce meaningfully higher ad revenue   per viewer than its competitors.YouTube will have a chance to prove itself, tooMedia companies will handle the majority of their ad buying at   the launch of YouTube TV, but YouTube will have access to about   two minutes of ads for every hour of viewing. That's the ad   inventory that every cable company receives. If YouTube can use   its decade of advertising experience and produce outsize results,   it could increase interest from media companies for its   services.That bit of advertising is about the only thing that will make   YouTube TV profitable, as analysts estimate its affiliate fees   total about $29 before accounting for various regional sports   networks, which could add $4 to $5.Suffice it to say YouTube TV has a lot running on that small   slice of advertising inventory.Taking on a $71 billion marketThe market Google is going after with YouTube TV isn't so much   the pay-TV market as it is the television advertising market.   Google tried to break into the market before by partnering with   media companies about a decade ago. Now, it's using YouTube TV as   a platform to gain access to that inventory, which generated   about $71 billion in the U.S. last year.Getting YouTube TV off the ground and showing media companies   what it's capable of with advertising is the first step. The more   successful it is with its own ad inventory, the more likely it is   to win the business of more media companies. In turn, more   customers will sign up as the value improves and YouTube is able   to bring on more networks.If YouTube TV is successful, it will be because its superior   advertising makes it a win-win-win -- the media companies, the   consumers, and YouTube.10 stocks we like better than Alphabet (C   shares)When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Then, QCOM stock could regather its momentum.Technically, it's currently in a measured run with still some upside potential. In today's trade I am not chasing the potential upside. It's more like I want to profit from the value below.Instead of chasing prices, I prefer selling risk against known ranges. It's easier to know where QCOM stock is not likely to go than to determine its future stock target value. So looking back a few years, I see clear areas of defense. The idea is to sell downside risk against levels that should be defended in case of corrections.9 Stocks to Buy That Are Growing Faster Than AmazonI also would be remiss not to note this: The industry and the broader equity markets are near all-time highs.

The company's IPO was multiple times oversubscribed and shares soared 44% on the first day of trading. However, shares fell nearly 10% yesterday amid reports that the company has come under fire from several institutional investorsSnap Lands into Trouble with Institutional   InvestorsInvestors aren't happy with the company's offering of 200 million Class A shares that carry no voting rights. Per a Business Insider report, they have ""approached"" stock index providers such as S&P Dow Jones Indices and MSCI Inc to prevent Snap and other such companies that offer shares without voting rights from getting incorporated into these benchmark indexes. The meeting is scheduled sometime this week.Investors argue that the absence of voting rights completely bars a shareholder from speaking on issues like a company's growth plans or compensation shelled out to executives. Business Insider also adds that if such a company is listed on any of the indices, ""then managers of stock index portfolios will have to buy its shares and other investors, whose performance is tracked against such indexes, would likely follow suit.""The absence of voting rights implies that the company does not intend to dilute its decision making power. Snap will have a three-tier share structure and founders Evan Spigel and Bobby Murphy will have maximum voting rights through the ownership of Class C shares, which carry 10 votes per share. The Class B shares carry one vote per share. Such form of corporate governance might prove detrimental for investors, especially when there is uncertainty about its future.What's Concerning Investors?Snap Inc has been shunned by many Wall Street analysts for various reasons. Citing instances of Twitter Inc.TWTR, Groupon Inc and many others, analysts believe that Snap ""will follow a pattern of hot, then cooling, tech IPOs.""Reportedly, most analysts have initiated coverage on Snap with a ""sell"" rating. These analysts argue that Snap has already started seeing its average daily user growth rate slowdown.  Plus, the company is yet to make profits. Though the company's revenues are on the rise, losses are ballooning. Reportedly, in 2016, Snap's revenues of $404.5 million were nearly six times higher than 2015 revenues but net loss for the year increased 38% to $514.6 million.Moreover, since Snapchat has just one source of revenues i.e., advertising, which only began in Oct 2016, it may be a concern for investors. Also, it attracts a particular segment of the demography.Analysts argue that teens are inclined to sudden changes in preferences. Media reports have quoted Snap ""admitting"" that increasing competition from big players like Facebook IncFB, which have better resources, is a big threat as they can easily lure users to their platform.In fact, Facebook outshines Snap in almost all aspects. The company enjoys a first mover advantage in the social media space with over 1.9 billion users from every segment of demography. It has a gargantuan base of over 1 billion DAUs compared with 158 million for Snap. Facebook presents a much larger canvas for advertisers than Snapchat. In fact, Facebook's total addressable market (TAM) has been reported to be 80% bigger than that of Snap.Also, Facebook through its Instagram application has started to emulate Snapchat features, which is a big threat for Snapchat. Analysts observe that Facebook can easily take chances by unveiling features that are similar to other social media services. This is because if these ""inspired"" features do not work, it can easily roll them back like it did previously with Poke, Slingshot and Bolt.After all, platforms like Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger do have their own inherent features that will prevent the loss of users. If these ""inspired"" features become popular like Facebook Live, people will view it as an improvement over the inherent features. This will significantly cut down the risk of migration if Snapchat becomes popular going ahead.An analyst was quoted saying ""Good-enough features plus being the first app to offer them at scale in a market could succeed better than having the best features but showing up late."" Compared to Facebook's worldwide popularity, Snap is mainly popular in the U.S and Canada. Apart from Facebook, Alphabet'sGOOGLYouTube is another formidable opponent for ad dollarsAlso, Snap's valuation is nosebleed. At nearly 60 times its revenues, analysts remain wary as it is too high compared to existing and future growth prospects.Wait, Not All Is Lost!!However, there are some analysts who aren't so negative on the stock. They believe that product innovations might help Snap to sustain the momentum.Thebest partabout the company is that it does not follow the usual advertising model of charging per click, rather it charges advertisers per day. The consistently expanding daily active user base has been attracting more and more consumers.Apart from this, the company's Snapchat Discover feature has enhanced its picture and video library, thereby attracting more and more advertisers. The feature also allows the company to partner with major events like the Oscars and Super Bowl. Discover currently accounts for a majority of the company's advertising revenues.At the Morgan Stanley conference held a couple of months back, CEO Spiegel was quoted by media reports as saying that 50% of its new user base now comprises users over the age of 25. Plus, Snapchat, in order to diversify its revenue base, has started selling Snapchat spectacles worth $130.ConclusionSnap is currently stealing all the limelight. It remains to be seen whether the company can keep the excitement alive by providing a more immersive experience. We can only hope that its success will not be ""ephemeral"" like its messaging features.Want to learn more about Snapchat stock?

Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock Looks Overbought. It Isn’t.;3/8/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFew names in the markets have almost universal appeal.Microsoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of them. Sure,Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) products have more appeal,Alphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG,NASDAQ:GOOGL) is more popular andAmazon.com, Inc(NASDAQ:AMZN) is more engaging, but let's give credit where credit is due. Most of us have grown up with Microsoft programs, and we continue to use them frequently to this day.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockOf course, emotional sentiment only goes so far. To prove its relevance in a changing world, Microsoft must deliver the goods. For most of this decade, the results for Microsoft stock have been fantastic.We're talking five out of seven years in the black, with an average annual profit of nearly 14%. In addition, MSFT stock has enjoyed four consecutive years of double-digit growth.I don't care how many caveats you can mention about the proverbial old dog … that's a trick that's tough to master at any age. Seemingly, the change at the top of the Microsoft war room, from Steve Ballmer to Satya Nadella, is working wonders. Most importantly, the willingness to aggressively push into new territory is encouraging for potential Microsoft shareholders.9 Stocks to Buy That Are Growing Faster Than AmazonInvestorPlace contributor Will Ashworth took this confidence further by declaring that MSFT stock willhit $80 this year. Is this wishful thinking, or is there more to this than mere bravado?Challenges Facing MSFT stockFirst things first - I admire the guts Ashworth displayed. That's putting yourself out there and giving clarity to your point of view. It's something I wish I could see in Washington, but that's a whole different ballgame.With MSFT stock specifically, the bullish argument is an easy one, but so is the cautious approach. Shares have soared despite the wave of competition in the consumer tech sector. InvestorPlace contributor Vince Martin speaks for a lot of people whenhe wrote, ""I continue to be surprised at the strength shown by Microsoft stock. MSFT stock has risen roughly 150% in just four years - despite little movement in profits.""The lack of fundamental growth is even more perplexing when you consider Microsoft's position within the fierce environment. The company is either lagging, or is getting challenged by rising up-and-comers. Martin writes:""For Office 365,Tableau Software Inc(NYSE:DATA) is challenging Excel - and 27% revenue growth in 2016 suggests DATA is taking share from MSFT. Behemoths likeOracle Corporation(NYSE:ORCL) and many others are in the cloud space. Microsoft's Dynamics CRM product is a distant second tosalesforce.com, inc. (NYSE:CRM).""A huge concern for those trading MSFT stock is the market capitalization. I'm not a fan of focusing on any one metric. Still, with its equity valued at half a trillion dollars, you have to take a step back. Is Microsoft stock really worth that much?Click to EnlargeKeep in mind that despite four consecutive years of double-digit growth, the magnitude has also declined. The first strike was 39.5% in 2013, followed by performances of 28.4%, 21.9% and 16.5%.Microsoft Stock Is a Proven WinnerAdmittedly, that's not the direction the trend should go. Nevertheless, I think Ashworth is going to be a happy camper. Like other tech names, Microsoft stock starts off the year fairly slowly. For example, its first quarter returns are a relatively pedestrian 8%.But at year's end, the average return jumps up to 30.7%, nearly four times higher. That also means that those who are concerned about this year's slow start for MSFT stock shouldn't be.The other attribute that is remarkable about Microsoft is its resiliency. Between 2000 and 2011, MSFT stock suffered a negative Q1 performance ten times. But in four of those instances, shares managed to claw back positive returns for the year. That provides a lot of security for those making strongly optimistic calls for Microsoft stock.While investors have reason to look at MSFT cautiously, I think Wall Street is giving Nadella and company a fair shake. They want to see what it can do with its long-term strategy, and the signs are encouraging. A prime example is Microsoft'shigh-profile acquisitionofLinkedIn. By integrating its intellectual capital with Microsoft's vast networks, it can do serious damage in the social media sphere.Snap Inc (SNAP) Stock: Stay Away at All Costs!Overall, $80 for Microsoft stock is very reasonable. Although not dominant, it's competing well in some of the most exciting and high-growth sectors. Both the company and the markets are loving the change in leadership and culture. Finally, Microsoft continues to find ways to do well, even in the most trying of circumstances. The only question is, can I be the first to call $100 in 2018?As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace3 Drug Stocks Hit by Trump's Call for Lower Prices4 Food Stocks at Risk Thanks to Record HeatThe postMicrosoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock Looks Overbought.

Has Snap Inc (SNAP) Become a Takeout Target for Facebook Inc (FB) Stock?;3/8/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIt's not exactly like taking candy from a baby, but themassive declineinSnap Inc(NYSE:SNAP) is being celebrated by short sellers who saw this fall coming from a mile away. I won't go so far to say ""I told you so,"" but you were warned. And with SNAP stock still under heavy selling pressure, calls forFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) to put SNAP out of its misery are growing. But does it make sense for FB stock?makeArticleAd();Source:The Crunchies! via FlickrFresh off its 44% one-day surge last Thursday, SNAP stock closed Tuesday at $21.44, plunging as much as 30% from its high Friday of $29.44. The parent of popular messaging app Snapchat is projected to lose money for the next couple of years. But that was the case a week ago, too.On Monday, Laura Martin, analysts at Needham & Company, rated SNAP stock a ""sell"" and slapping it with low target range of $19. She's one of five analysts will a sell rating.It seems analysts have begun to look beyond the initial hysteria to now realize Snap's slowing user growth puts it closer to the reality ofTwitter Inc(NYSE:TWTR), which is trading more than 40% below its own IPO price from a couple of years ago.Still, Snap's suffering could be Facebook's gain. Snap's platform and its existing user demographic have tons of value to sustain Facebook's ad growth objectives.7 Stocks That Will Hit All-Time Lows in 2017Since its launch, the Snapchat app has consistently focused on introducing new and unique features, making it widely popular among teenagers. The company claims the app had 158 million daily active users per day at the end of 2016 - majority of which are between 18 and 34 years old. These totals mark a 48% year-over-year increase. And the fact that the daily users visit more than 20 times per day (on an average 30 minutes per visit) could be a boon for marketers.Beyond being a revenue driver for Facebook, by acquiring Snap, FB stock would be eliminating a potential threat. This is something it has strategically done with acquisitions of both Instagram and WhatsApp, which have become core to Facebook's growth. In that regard, CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been brilliant.The question, then, at what point (or valuation) does it make sense for Facebook to pounce?As of Tuesday's close, Snap had a market cap of $25 billion, which analyst seems to consider overvalued. And with an average price target of $15.50, which implies a target market cap of around $20 billion, Facebook may want to wait. But does it want to risk losing Snap toMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) or perhaps worse,Alphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL)?Bottom Line for FB StockThe many options still available to Facebook makes FB stock one that should be owned, not traded. Combined with accelerating ad-revenue growth, Facebook's $6 billion stock buyback and its mobile assets, FB stock should reach $160 in the next 12 to 18 months, driven by projected year-over-year EPS growth of almost 30%.As of this writing, Richard Saintvilus did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace7 Telecom Stocks That Are High-Yield Money Traps5 Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy in MarchIs Caterpillar Inc.

Stocks recently featured in the blog includeApple's(NASDAQ:AAPL-Free Report),Pandora(NYSE:P-Free Report),Alphabet Inc.'s(NASDAQ:GOOGL-Free Report), andSony(NYSE:SNE-Free Report).Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations.Get #1Stock of the Day pick for free.Here are highlights from Tuesday's Analyst Blog:Will Spotify Stream into an IPO in 2017?Launched in 2008 by entrepreneurs Daniel Ek and Martin Lorentzon, Stockholm, Sweden-basedSpotifyis one of the most popular streaming services on the market today. With its desktop and mobile app version, the company allows users to search or browse, for free, through its extensive music library. Spotify also offers a ""Premium"" subscription for $9.99 per month that removes advertisements and lets users download music to listen to offline.CompetitionSpotify recently announced that it now has 100 million monthly active users, with 50 million paying for the service. This achievement has cemented its status as the biggest subscription music service by user count, and the leader in the increasingly crowded music streaming industry.Arguably Spotify's biggest market rival is Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL-Free Report) Apple Music. Launched in 2015, Apple Music is a streaming music service based on Beats Music, which has drawn listeners with playlists made by experts, not algorithms. The service is also known for its collaborations with high-profile musicians like Drake and Taylor Swift. It costs $9.99 per month, and users can download music from an extensive digital library, just like Spotify. Apple Music offers listeners a free, three-month initial trial.There's also Tidal, the Scandinavian streaming service that rapper and mogul Jay Z scooped up back in 2015 for $56 million. It has a similar price of $9.99 per month for normal streaming, while also offering a $19.99 per month option that includes high-fidelity sound quality. Like Apple Music, Tidal is known for its partnerships with big music names. Rihanna, Beyoncé, and Kanye West all exclusively debuted their latest albums on Tidal before a wider release.Other top rivals include Rdio, which provides access to online radio stations, with different levels of on-demand access, for $3.99 to $9.99 per month; Pandora (NYSE:P-Free Report), one of the original internet radio companies, goes for $4.99 per month to avoid ads; Rhapsody, the original streaming music subscription service, has been around since 2001, and is available for $9.99 per month; and Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOGL-Free Report) Google Play Music, which offers online music storage and a streaming service for $9.99 per month.ControversiesDespite its popularity, Spotify tends to draw out negative publicity, mainly over debates about its free advertising-supported service. This service allows people who are prepared to sit through occasional ads to listen to songs for free on demand. Music labels-Spotify is in compliance with Sony (NYSE:SNE-Free Report), EMI, Warner Music Group, and Universal, among others-understandably dislike the free service because it dismantles album sales, and pays less in royalties than the subscription does.We all remember Spotify's battle with Taylor Swift. The popstar withdrew her entire catalog from the service because she ""didn't like the way it felt. I think there should be an inherent value placed on art. I didn't see that happening, perception-wise, when I put my music on Spotify,"" shesaid in an interviewwithTime.Other musicians soon followed in her footsteps. Icelandic singer Björk made her latest albumVulnicuraunavailable on Spotify and other streaming services, though her back catalogue remained available. And in 2015, British songstress Adele similarly restricted her Grammy-winning album25from all streaming services-however, you can currently listen to it on Spotify, along with her other albums,19and21-on its release date,tellingTimethat ""I believe music should be an event.""Last year, Spotify was embroiled in issues surrounding its updated Terms and Conditions of Use, where in ablog post, the company's user communications manager Candace Katz explains ""We may ask for customer permission to collect information from new sources, such as address book, location, and sensor data [and photos, voice controls, and contacts] from the mobile device to improve the customer experience and inform product decisions.""This unexpectedly caused an uproar, with many calling Spotify's new privacy policy ""eerie"" and ""creepy"" and pledging to unsubscribe from the service. The backlash was bad enough that CEO Ek wrote another blog post, aptly called ""SORRY"" in order to explain that users don't have to share this information if they don't want to. ""We will ask for your express permission before accessing any of this data - and we will only use it for specific purposes that will allow you to customize your Spotify experience.""An IPO on the Horizon?Over the past few years or so, Spotify has been on the hunt for new funding. The company closed funding rounds in 2012 and 2013, raising $100 million and $250 million, respectively. In 2016, Spotify completed a whopping $526 million round of funding, putting it at a valuation of roughly $8.5 billion, a move that showed investors its desire for expansion and new forms of content-a few months before this funding round, Spotify announced its plan to add videos and podcasts from partners like ESPN, NBC, Comedy Central, and Condé Nast.And about a year ago, the company raised $1 billion in convertible debt on the promise that its new investors will receive a 30% discount on shares when it files for an IPO. Spotify will have to pay 5% annual interest on the debt, however, and 1% more every six months, up to a total of 10%, until it goes public.This decision to raise money through convertible debt was a smart move, as Spotify was able to maintain its high valuation without diluting its existing shareholders. It does suggest the company is seriously thinking about an IPO, since the latest round of funding encourages Spotify to go public sooner rather than later.Or, at least, that's what was originally thought.According toTechCrunch, Spotify is apparently considering delaying its IPO to 2018, with sources saying the company wants to use the time to ""build a better balance sheet and work on shifting its business model to improve its margins."" But in reality, the delay is likely linked to Spotify's inability to finalize new licensing deals with the big record labels like Universal, Sony, and Warner, whom control 80% of recorded music.There's no doubt about Spotify's rapid growth and universal reach, but it remains unprofitable mostly because of the fees paid to these music labels. The company supposedly pays a royalty rate of 55% of its sales, and is fighting to pay less. Nevertheless, its impressive valuation-aTechCrunchsource hopes to target a valuation between $11 billion and $13 billion--and popularity will work in their favor when their public debut comes. Patience is a virtue, fellow investor, so sit back, relax, and wait for Spotify's exciting future.Now That Snapchat is Public, Which Tech Giant Could IPO   Next?You may be curious about the buzz surrounding Snap's IPO, but should you buy up this tech stock?

Apple Inc. (AAPL) iPhone 8: New Name, Late Release?;3/8/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsApple Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AAPL) upcoming flagship smartphone continues to be the subject of intense speculation. With the countdown on to finalizing design and starting production of the new iPhone, two details in particular have seen conflicting theories: the name and the display size.makeArticleAd();Source: AppleA new post from Japan'sMac Otakarasuggests AAPL will go with the iPhone Edition - instead of iPhone 8 or 10th anniversary iPhone - for its flagship model.The website also feels it has nailed the display size, and agrees with a previous report that the new iPhone could arrive significantly later than usual.iPhone 8 = iPhone Edition?What to call the new iPhone is actually a big deal this year. The regular naming sequence will continue with the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus. Those are the phones for everyone. But what do you call the all-new flagship AAPL is expected to release -the $1,000+ smartphonethat celebrates a decade in the business (and hopefully helps to propel sales to stratospheric levels)?The iPhone X, 10th Anniversary iPhone and iPhone 8 have been the front runners. But what would you call the 10th Anniversary iPhonenextyear? And iPhone 8 would mess up Apple's naming scheme for its mainstream models.Apple Inc. (AAPL) Can't Commit to HollywoodMac OtakarathinksAAPL will go with the iPhone Edition. The premium Apple Watch model is the Apple Watch Edition, so the precedent has already been set and it would be consistent. This would also solve the continuity problem associated with naming a new iPhone specifically around the 10th anniversary, without messing up the current iPhone naming scheme. iPhone Edition makes sense.About the New iPhone DisplayOutside of whether it would be curved or not, or OLED or not, there have been conflicting reports about the display's size. Most analysts have been calling for a 5.8-inch display with bezels practically eliminated. That would let AAPL fit a larger display into an iPhone that's smaller than the 5.5-inch iPhone 7 Plus.It's a similar approach to whatSamsung Electronics Co Ltd(OTCMKTS:SSNLF)appears to have taken with the Galaxy S8.However,Mac Otakarahas always maintained - and still insists - that the new iPhone will have a 5-inch display. Which seems weird, given the consumer preference for big screens.Mac Rumorsconnected the dotsand theorizes that the information given to the Japanese website is for theusablespace. The remaining display area would be where AAPL has a row of virtual buttons - a feature that has already been mentioned as replacing the Home button and mimicking the functionality of the new MacBook Pro Touch Bar.Take a 5.8-inch display, reserve the bottom of that display for the virtual buttons, and you end up with what is effectively a 5-inch display in terms of what the owner can make use of.The math is starting to add up.iPhone Edition Could Be DelayedFinally,Mac Otakaraagrees with the growing number of analysts who are predicting the iPhone 8 - or iPhone Edition - is going to face a delayed release.A few days ago,9to5 Macreported the iPhone 7s series would go into production in July, as expected. But there are rumors that the TouchID sensor that AAPL is integrating into the new iPhone Edition's display is proving challenging. The added manufacturing complexity may push mass production for the new flagship model to September. That would mean severe supply constraints, including the possibility that theiPhone Edition would not begin shipping until a month after the iPhone 7s, with only early pre-orders being delivered in 2017.If the production issues turn out to be true, the results could be problematic … but not necessarily.Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Is Still ""The One""On the downside, Apple would face the possibility that potential iPhone 7s buyers hold off until they can physically compare it against the iPhone Edition, delaying that wave of upgrades. Potential iPhone Edition buyers could also shrug and order the iPhone 7s instead, not wishing to wait a few months for their new smartphone. And without the 1-2 punch of the 7s and iPhone Edition together, AAPL could miss out on the spectacularly record-smashing launch sales weekend it is gunning for to celebrate that 10th anniversary.On the upside, the annual crest of sales that accompany every new iPhone release could be extended. The iPhone 7s would get the first rush, followed by the iPhone Edition.It's possible.As always, stay tuned. At this stage, everything we ""know"" about the new iPhone is speculation. But with AAPL's supply chain starting to crank up for production, the pieces are beginning to fall into place.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceHow to Buy Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

How to Buy Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock the RIGHT Way;3/8/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBears fired a shot across the bow inAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMD). The recovering chipmaker has fallen 16% from its highs over the past week amid heavy profit-taking. The million-dollar question is whether this is yet another in a long line of buyable dips for AMD stock, or if it's the beginning of a more ominous reversal.makeArticleAd();Click to EnlargeSource: OptionsAnalytixLet's investigate the price action to see if there are any clues to be had.For starters, the selling sortie was sufficient to break AMD's 20-day moving average. Chalk it up as a minor victory for the bears, but more work remains before the entrenched uptrend is reversed. Thus far, prior support has held strong in the $12.50 zone. Until that levee gives way, the uptrend deserves the benefit of the doubt. Plus, AMD stock remains above rising 50-day and 200-day moving averages.A second feather in the bears' cap is the substantial volume accompanying the decline. The trio of distribution days suggests institutional selling, the likes of which could weigh on the stock for days to come. This should temper the enthusiasm of those rooting for a swift recovery from this price dip.9 Stocks to Buy That Are Growing Faster Than AmazonIt's more likely that AMD chops around a bit to work through further supply before climbing anew.How to Win With AMD Stock Right NowFortunately, the options market provides a strategy well-suited for a situation like this.Let's say you're willing to step in and buy this dip, but you want a bit of a buffer in case AMD shares fall 10% to 20% further before finally rebounding.You could sell the Apr $11 put for 35 cents or better. Worst case, Advanced Micro Devices sits below $11 at expiration, and you are obligated to buy 100 shares per contract sold at an effective purchase price of $10.65. From there, you could begin selling covered calls to further reduce your cost basis.Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Is Still ""The One""On the flip side, if AMD stock remains above $11 by expiration, the put option will expire worthless, allowing you to pocket the 35 cents per share ($35 total).The initial margin requirement for the naked put should be around $120, so although $35 doesn't sound like a large reward, it comes out to an impressive 29% return on the initial investment.As of this writing, Tyler Craig held naked puts in AMD.More From InvestorplaceBuy Ford Motor Company (F) Stock at a 12% Discount Now!3 Biotech Stocks That Could Double OvernightThe Best Investments for 2017The postHow to Buy Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Is Still “The One”;3/8/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsShares ofAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL) rebounded nicely following their short-lived but sharp post-earnings selloff in late January. This very ability of GOOGL stock to recover so quickly speaks to underlying demand and a multimonth uptrend that active investors and traders must respect until proven otherwise.makeArticleAd();When I last discussed Alphabet stock onJan. 9, I said that shares appeared to have good upside potential into late January. I wanted to target the $845-$850 area before the Jan. 26 earnings report. The stock reached the upper end of this price range by Jan. 24.Note that this was specifically a pre-earnings trade; the goal was to get out before Alphabet's report on Jan. 26.Why? Because empirically, trying to time a specific post-earnings outcome for any given stock has at best a 50% chance of success.9 Stocks to Buy That Are Growing Faster Than AmazonWhile parts of the broader stock market showed some signs of volatility in recent days, the tech-heavyNasdaq-100- as represented by thePowerShares QQQ Trust, Series 1(ETF)(NASDAQ:QQQ) - continues to motor higher. Both GOOGL stock and GOOG stock, being an important part of this index often times can flash important signals as to the next directional move in the Nasdaq-100.GOOGL Stock ChartsLooking at the big-picture multiyear weekly chart of Alphabet, we see that the uptrend (purple-dotted parallels) remains well intact. However, GOOGL is now bumping up against the very upper end of this range.Click to EnlargeAnother way of looking at this trading channel is to note that previous attempts at overshooting to the upside failed. As such, traders and investors primarily want to respect the trend.The weekly chart provides some perspective as to the possibility of another explosive move higher from here. In fairness, that likelihood is fairly low in this time frame - at least without some sort of sideways consolidation, if not an outright corrective move lower to the middle or lower end of said channel.On the daily chart, we see that GOOGL stock last November and December found support at its 200-day simple moving average (red). This was followed by a rally that pushed the stock back above its 50-day MA (yellow), which acted as support in early January and early February.Click to EnlargeThe sharp rebound following a multiday selloff on the back of the January earnings report is impressive. By last week, it had GOOGL stock bumping right back at the pre-earnings levels around $860.Sears Holdings Corp (SHLD) Is Going Bankrupt and Has No Way OutAlthough the stock has taken a little breather in recent days, on Monday, shares closed well off their intraday lows. Follow-through buying commenced on Tuesday.Active investors and traders can now use Monday's lows around $840 as a stop-loss to play the stock higher for a trade to new highs with a first upside price target around $870-$880.More conservative traders may want to first wait for GOOGL stock to close back above the $855 area before legging into this trade.Like what you see?

YouTube Officially Enters the Skinny Bundle TV Business;3/7/2017;"In this segment from theMarket Foolery, the team digs into the latest salvo in the cord-cutting   wars with the release of YouTube TV, which stands out with its   unlimited cloud-based DVR. And when it comes to monetization,   being a subsidiary ofAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) gives the service a serious   advantage.A full transcript follows the video.10 stocks we like better than NetflixWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run     for over a decade,Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has tripled the market.*makeArticleAd();David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy right now... and Netflix wasn't one of     them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even     better buys.Click hereto learn about these picks!*Stock Advisor returns as of February 6, 2017This video was recorded on March 1, 2016.Mac Greer:On Tuesday, YouTube introduced YouTube TV. For $35 a month, you   get around 40 streaming channels. That includes the major   networks -- ESPN, Fox News, MSNBC. David, YouTube is also   partnered with local TV stations, so you could get local sports   and news. Now, what you do not get is CNN, HBO, AMC, A&E,   Comedy Central. So, there are some channels missing there. A lot   of competition in this space. I guess the phrase that pays is   ""skinny bundle."" There are a lot of skinny bundles with Sling and   the like. What do you make of YouTube?David Kretzmann:I think the two advantages that YouTube has here, potentially,   and they say that they are negotiating with other content   partners, so hopefully they can get some of those other partners   on board onto this package, but, the two things that stick out to   me that YouTube can do probably better than anyone else,   especially with the current players, they're offering unlimited   cloud-based DVR storage. Essentially, you'll be able to record up   to nine months of content on YouTube. So, they're leveraging the   dominant Google Cloud infrastructure in business that Alphabethas   built up over the years. That's something you can't do with Sling   TV. With Sling TV, you can only watch it live. You can't record   something, you can't set up to record something ahead of time.   You either watch it live or you miss it. I think that unlimited   cloud-based DVR aspect, that's a really user-friendly aspect that   tears into the traditional linear TV model. I think it makes the   skinny bundle model, or that online streaming model, much more   appealing and attractive for users. The other thing that sticks   out to me that YouTube could probably do really well down the   road is advertising. You could essentially, what Google could   offer advertisers is say, ""We know this individual, they search   for these products, they have these Search terms on Google, they   have these viewing habits on YouTube."" I think Google could   arguably do a better job than anyone else of really personalizing   and targeting individual ads to users. So, your live TV ads would   be different from Matt's, so to speak. I don't know if that's   necessarily the plan right now right off the bat, but I think   down the road, that is something that could really play to   YouTube's advantage.Matt Argersinger:It's fascinating to watch the evolution of the TV digital   streaming market, whatever you want to call it. But in a way, I   almost feel like we're coming full circle. If you think about it,   when I learned that YouTube was going to have ESPN, I thought,   that's huge, that's very compelling. But then, I say, wait, I   still want CNN, I like AMC, I still want HBO. So, I start to   think to myself, wait, I'm probably going to need two or three   skinny bundles. Plus HBO Now, plusNetflix. Then all of the sudden I'm paying over $100 a month anyway, and   then it's like, why don't I just stick with my cable   subscription?Greer:I need a keyboard to go with my iPad.Argersinger:It's interesting. I think, if you really ask a consumer what they   want, they want the true à la carte service. Just give me the 15   channels I want plus HBO and plus Netflix. That's what I want.   And I'll pay a fee for that. But the bundling continues, and   that's something that cable companies have done successfully for   decades now. So, it seems like we're coming full circle with the   TV market.Greers:Guys, this really also seems like kind of a play for the future.Piper Jaffrayhad a recent report that said 26% of teens watch YouTube   every day. As those teens get older, and as they make more and   more purchasing decisions, maybe YouTube TV becomes their   television.Argersinger:It's already a tremendous brand. If you think about, amazingly,   if you think about the Mount Rushmore of online properties,   YouTube is absolutely there right next to Google which acquired,   brilliantly, YouTube some 10 years ago now. Amazing.Kretzmann:Yeah, and the Wall Street Journal just reported that the amount   of content viewed on YouTube each day is now a billion hours a   day. That's up 10X since 2012. So, the level of engagement that   is on YouTube already is staggering. I think this TV offering, I   think this is one of the more attractive TV offerings, aside from   those properties that aren't included in this initial bundle. But   I think with that cloud storage, that makes it very appealing,   especially to younger viewers who don't necessarily want to sit   down and watch a live show from eight to nine at night. They want   to watch it whenever they want. They don't want to watch   commercials. So, with that cloud storage, you can watch it when   you want, you can skip the commercials. From a user experience   perspective, I just think that's far and away above live TV,   whether it's through a traditional cable package or online   streaming. People just want to watch things on their own terms. I   think this skinny bundle offering with YouTube is moving closer   to that direction. But like Matt said, it's still not true à la   carte. I think, ideally, people would pay $5 for CNN, $10 for   ESPN, they'd be able to just pick --Argersinger:$20 for the NFL games that I want to watch this month.Kretzmann:Right. And potentially just paying for a game. Maybe I'm not an   NFL fan, but I'll pay to watch the Superbowl, or something like   that. I think it'll be interesting to see if we move in that   direction. I think from a user experience perspective, that's   probably what most people would like. But whether or not the   cable companies let that happen, they'll certainly be resistant   to moving in that direction.Greer:How about, best thing you have watched recently, as we close?Argersinger:Let's see ... I watched this show calledTravelerson Netflix. I don't know if you've seen it, it's one of those   Netflix Original Series. Really well done. It's a slow starter,   as a lot of these series are. But by the fourth or fifth episode,   I was addicted, and I think my wife and I binged in like three   nights. It was good stuff.Kretzmann:I recently watched Sneaky Pete --Greer:Solid.Kretzmann:-- which is one of the most recentAmazonOriginals. Also,The People vs OJ Simpson, that was on Netflix, that was great. As someone who was born in   1992, I missed the OJ story, and now I get it, I get why people   are obsessed with it. It's a great story.Argersinger:I can't believe that.Kretzmann:I'm catching up on my history.Argersinger:I watched the white Bronco live with my dad.Greer:Speaking of catching up, I watchedDumb and Dumberfor the first time with my kids.Argersinger:For the first time? Wow.Greer:Yes, I have never seen it. Father of the year. My eleven year old   loved it. As did my eight year old.Kretzmann:Quality entertainment.Greer:Yeah, it's high brow. On a slightly more serious note, there's a   new HBO show calledCrashing, which is really good. I'm two episodes in. The producer is Judd   Apatow. It's very well done.

Will Snapchat Become the Next Twitter or Facebook?;3/7/2017;"After months of speculations,Snap Inc., the parent company of social media mobile app Snapchat, finally got listed on the New York Stock Exchange last week. With this, arguments whether the company will become more like FacebookFBor turn to TwitterTWTRin the next few years, have heated up.Notably, shares of the two established social media companies - Facebook and Twitter - have taken divergent paths since their respective Initial Public Offerings (IPO). At yesterday's closing price, Facebook is up 261.6% from its IPO price; while Twitter is trading 40.2% down from its IPO price.Undoubtedly, neither the company nor the stakeholders will ever prefer it to become like Twitter, which is witnessing declining user base, revenues and earnings. On the contrary, it will like to become more like Facebook or even better, which has seen a tremendous rise in user base, revenues as well as earnings.Although, it will be quite early to forecast where the company will find itself after five years from now; the business model demonstrates both positive and negative aspects following thestock's recent decline post IPO.What Makes it More like FacebookSnap is known for its social media mobile app - Snapchat - which was founded in 2011, and officially launched in 2012. The app allows users to take photos and record videos, as well as facilitate editing options and share the same with friends. However, photos or videos can be viewed for few seconds only and then they disappear, and also cannot be saved.Since its launch, the app has been steadily getting popular among teenagers, thanks to its consistent focus on introducing new and unique features. Per the company, the app had 158 million daily active users per day at the end of 2016, which represented year-over-year growth of 48%. Of these, majority are between 18 and 34 years old. The daily users visit the Snapchat app more than 20 times a day, on an average, and spend over 30 minutes.Although, the daily active user count is way lesser than Facebook's over 1.20 billion, it has already surpassed Twitter's over 130-million daily visitors. Also, the rate at which it is growing, it has the potential to reduce the gap with Facebook.Going ahead, the best part of the company is that it has been able to monetize the app. The company does not follow the typical Internet advertising model of charging per click; rather it charges advertisers per day. The consistently growing daily active user base has been attracting more and more consumers.Apart from this, the company's Snapchat Discover feature has expanded its picture and video library, thereby attracting more and more advertisers. The feature also allows the company to partner with major events like the Oscars and Super Bowl. Discover currently accounts for a majority of the company's advertising revenue.It should be noted that the company registered almost a seven-fold year-over-year jump in its 2016 revenues, which reached $404.9 million from $58.7 million recorded in 2015. Going ahead, the company projects its annual revenues and daily active user base to reach approximately $2 billion and 221 million, respectively, in 2018.Snap's constant efforts in introducing new and unique app features, along with its innovative adverting ideas, will enable it in achieving its target.Despite this, it will be far lesser than Facebook, which generated $27.6 billion revenues in 2016, and is still growing. However, if Snap achieved its target for 2018, it will certainly be closing its gap with Twitter which generated $2.5 billion in revenues and has been witnessing a slowdown in growth rate.Why It May Fall to TwitterLooking at the above discussion, it seems that Snap does look like Facebook. However, there are a number of challenges which may trouble it in becoming the next Facebook and put it in Twitter's shoes.The major threat comes from Facebook which introduced the new ""Stories"" feature at its Instagram app last year. This new feature allows users to post photos and video slideshows which disappear after a 24-hour period. Instagram stories directly mirror Snapchat's own stories feature. Reportedly, after this launch, Snapchat has recorded a slowdown in its users' growth rate in the second half of 2016.The second major concern is that even after five years of journey, the company has failed to make itself profitable just like Twitter before its IPO. On the contrary, Facebook had made over $1 billion of profit in the fiscal year just before its IPO in 2012.Furthermore, since the early days of Snapchat, this disappearing messaging app has been associated with sexting. Snapchat has also dealt with a few other embarrassing issues, including two different racially insensitive filters. All this may put the company in unnecessary controversies and bring in unwanted investigation.ConclusionInvestors ideally vision Snap to grow like Facebook and not become Twitter. However, we believe that Facebook's well established position in the social media industry, ever-growing user base and the popular Instagram service are significant threat to Snapchat's growth prospects.In addition, the company will have a tough task grabbing market share in the digital ad space, which is mainly dominated by Facebook and AlphabetGOOGLaka Google.Want to learn more about Snapchat stock?

Instagram: How Facebook's Photo-Sharing App Makes Money;3/7/2017;"Instagram, the photo-sharing app, created by Kevin Systrom and Mike Kreiger in 2010, is now one of the most popular apps among users. The companyreportedreaching half a billion monthly active users in June 2016.In April of 2012, FacebookFB, the social media giant, acquired Instagram for about $1 billion in cash and stock. At the time, Instagram had only been around for less than two years, with initial funding of $500,000 from Baseline Ventures and Andreessen Horowitz. It was the largest acquisition that Facebook made before its IPO in May 2012 and many on the outside had questioned the purchase.So How Does Instagram Makes Money?Just like its parent company, Instagram makes all of its money from selling advertising. Instagram has three types of ads: image ads, video ads and carousel ads.The ads are shared directly on users' newsfeed and Stories. As the users scroll through their newsfeed, ads are distributed between actual users' content. The users then have the option to follow the brand's account or to click on an ad to learn more about its product or service.Similar to newsfeed, ads are also distributed on Instagram's Stories, a SnapchatSNAP-like feature that lets users share temporary pictures or videos.Users will see the ads in one of the three ad types and have the option to skip or click on the ad.Instagram's advertisers include Nike Inc.NKE, General ElectricGEand GoogleGOOGL.Bottom LineThough Facebook doesn't disclose Instagram's financials,Fortunereportedthat Instagram said they now had 500,000 advertisers back in September 2016. Analysts from Credit Suisse said Instagram is estimated to have $5.3 billion in revenues.In Facebook's 2016 fourth quarter earnings report, the company reported 1.2 billion daily active users worldwide and $8.6 billion in advertising sales. Though it is noted that the 1.2 billion users don't include sole users of Instagram, WhatsApp or Oculus, many users do use a combination of all three both, and Instagram accounts are often linked with a user's Facebook account.makeArticleAd();Long-Term Buys You Won't See in the NewsThe stocks you see in today's headlines may not be in the news tomorrow or next week.

Its stock is only in the middle of a 12-month ascending range in prices. So as long as markets don't suffer a severe setback, Alphabet should stay on track.Fundamentally, Alphabet management is a proven winner. Over the past few years, they addressed most of their critics' sticking points. Now the company is a money-printing machine, with several more sources of income soon to come.

This is a bullish trade for which I collect $1.80 per contract to open or better. The price buffer from current levels gives this trade a 90% theoretical chance of success to yield about 20% on money risked.I usually like to balance my trade. In this case I will sell opposing risk to hedge my bet.The Hedge (Optional):Sell GOOGL Sep $990/$1,000 credit call spread. This is a bearish trade for which I collect 70 cents per contract to open. To win I need GOOGL to stay below my sold risk. This side alone has a 90% theoretical chance of success to yield 13% on risk.Taking both trades would constitute a sold iron condor for which I collect $2.50 per contract to open. The overall position reduces my risk since I can only lose on one side or the other. If GOOGL stock stays between my spreads this trade would yield 33% on money risked.I am not required to hold my trades open through expiration. I can close either side for partial gains or losses at any time.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director ofSellSpreads.com.

Will Spotify Stream Into an IPO in 2017?;3/7/2017;"Launched in 2008 by entrepreneurs Daniel Ek and Martin Lorentzon, Stockholm, Sweden-basedSpotifyis one of the most popular streaming services on the market today. With its desktop and mobile app version, the company allows users to search or browse, for free, through its extensive music library. Spotify also offers a ""Premium"" subscription for $9.99 per month that removes advertisements and lets users download music to listen to offline.CompetitionSpotify recently announced that it now has 100 million monthly active users, with 50 million paying for the service. This achievement has cemented its status as the biggest subscription music service by user count, and the leader in the increasingly crowded music streaming industry.Arguably Spotify's biggest market rival is Apple'sAAPLApple Music. Launched in 2015, Apple Music is a streaming music service based on Beats Music, which has drawn listeners with playlists made by experts, not algorithms. The service is also known for its collaborations with high-profile musicians like Drake and Taylor Swift. It costs $9.99 per month, and users can download music from an extensive digital library, just like Spotify. Apple Music offers listeners a free, three-month initial trial.There's also Tidal, the Scandinavian streaming service that rapper and mogul Jay Z scooped up back in 2015 for $56 million. It has a similar price of $9.99 per month for normal streaming, while also offering a $19.99 per month option that includes high-fidelity sound quality. Like Apple Music, Tidal is known for its partnerships with big music names. Rihanna, Beyoncé, and Kanye West all exclusively debuted their latest albums on Tidal before a wider release.Other top rivals include Rdio, which provides access to online radio stations, with different levels of on-demand access, for $3.99 to $9.99 per month; PandoraP, one of the original internet radio companies, goes for $4.99 per month to avoid ads; Rhapsody, the original streaming music subscription service, has been around since 2001, and is available for $9.99 per month; and Alphabet Inc.'sGOOGLGoogle Play Music, which offers online music storage and a streaming service for $9.99 per month.ControversiesDespite its popularity, Spotify tends to draw out negative publicity, mainly over debates about its free advertising-supported service. This service allows people who are prepared to sit through occasional ads to listen to songs for free on demand. Music labels-Spotify is in compliance with SonySNE, EMI, Warner Music Group, and Universal, among others-understandably dislike the free service because it dismantles album sales, and pays less in royalties than the subscription does.We all remember Spotify's battle with Taylor Swift. The popstar withdrew her entire catalog from the service because she ""didn't like the way it felt. I think there should be an inherent value placed on art. I didn't see that happening, perception-wise, when I put my music on Spotify,"" shesaid in an interviewwithTime.Other musicians soon followed in her footsteps. Icelandic singer Björk made her latest albumVulnicuraunavailable on Spotify and other streaming services, though her back catalogue remained available. And in 2015, British songstress Adele similarly restricted her Grammy-winning album25from all streaming services-however, you can currently listen to it on Spotify, along with her other albums,19and21-on its release date,tellingTimethat ""I believe music should be an event.""Last year, Spotify was embroiled in issues surrounding its updated Terms and Conditions of Use, where in ablog post, the company's user communications manager Candace Katz explains ""We may ask for customer permission to collect information from new sources, such as address book, location, and sensor data [and photos, voice controls, and contacts] from the mobile device to improve the customer experience and inform product decisions.""This unexpectedly caused an uproar, with many calling Spotify's new privacy policy ""eerie"" and ""creepy"" and pledging to unsubscribe from the service. The backlash was bad enough that CEO Ek wrote another blog post, aptly called ""SORRY"" in order to explain that users don't have to share this information if they don't want to. ""We will ask for your express permission before accessing any of this data - and we will only use it for specific purposes that will allow you to customize your Spotify experience.""An IPO on the Horizon?Over the past few years or so, Spotify has been on the hunt for new funding. The company closed funding rounds in 2012 and 2013, raising $100 million and $250 million, respectively. In 2016, Spotify completed a whopping $526 million round of funding, putting it at a valuation of roughly $8.5 billion, a move that showed investors its desire for expansion and new forms of content-a few months before this funding round, Spotify announced its plan to add videos and podcasts from partners like ESPN, NBC, Comedy Central, and Condé Nast.And about a year ago, the company raised $1 billion in convertible debt on the promise that its new investors will receive a 30% discount on shares when it files for an IPO. Spotify will have to pay 5% annual interest on the debt, however, and 1% more every six months, up to a total of 10%, until it goes public.This decision to raise money through convertible debt was a smart move, as Spotify was able to maintain its high valuation without diluting its existing shareholders. It does suggest the company is seriously thinking about an IPO, since the latest round of funding encourages Spotify to go public sooner rather than later.Or, at least, that's what was originally thought.According toTechCrunch, Spotify is apparently considering delaying its IPO to 2018, with sources saying the company wants to use the time to ""build a better balance sheet and work on shifting its business model to improve its margins."" But in reality, the delay is likely linked to Spotify's inability to finalize new licensing deals with the big record labels like Universal, Sony, and Warner, whom control 80% of recorded music.There's no doubt about Spotify's rapid growth and universal reach, but it remains unprofitable mostly because of the fees paid to these music labels. The company supposedly pays a royalty rate of 55% of its sales, and is fighting to pay less. Nevertheless, its impressive valuation-aTechCrunchsource hopes to target a valuation between $11 billion and $13 billion--and popularity will work in their favor when their public debut comes. Patience is a virtue, fellow investor, so sit back, relax, and wait for Spotify's exciting future.Now That Snapchat is Public, Which Tech Giant Could IPO   Next?You may be curious about the buzz surrounding Snap's IPO, but should you buy up this tech stock?

No, Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Isn’t Expensive;3/7/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhat's particularly interesting aboutFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) stock at the moment is that it's rather inexpensive. In fact, it's downright cheap. That perhaps seems odd, given that Facebook stock is worth almost $400 billion, not to mention that FB stock is at an all-time high and that the Facebook stock price has risen by a factor of eight times in barely four years.makeArticleAd();Source:SilverIsdead Via FlickrBut it's true, at least on an earnings basis. FB stock trades at about 21x analyst estimates for 2017 EPS, and around 20x 2018 figures. Backing out the company's roughly $10 per share in cash, the multiples drop to 23.4x for 2017 and, incredibly, just 19x for 2018.TheS&P 500index trades at about 18x-plus 2017 profits and 17x 2018 figures. That means, somewhat incredibly, that Facebook stock trades at a multiple not far above the average U.S. large cap stock.Coming off a year where FB grew revenue 57% and doubled operating income, that seems ridiculously low. And compared to the post-IPO valuation ofSnap Inc(NYSE:SNAP), it seems almost absurd.There are some reasons for FB's relatively low multiple - but not enough, in my opinion. Comparing Facebook to SNAP and other high-growth stocks, it's hard to come to anything but one conclusion. Facebook stock likely has more room to run.Facebook Stock Is Cheaper Than Most High-FlyersWhatever one thinks of the SNAP IPO, it certainly highlights just how reasonable Facebook's valuation is in comparison. Snap Inc, of course, is unprofitable, which makes price-to-earnings comparisons impossible. But at the moment, SNAP trades at an enterprise value to revenue multiple of about 47x. That multiple would value FB stock at $550 - and all of Facebook stockat about $1.6 trillion.5 Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy in MarchObviously, that's a bit of a facetious example. Facebook's revenue growth is expected to slow in 2017, by the company's own admission. Snap, in contrast, still is learning how to actually monetize its user base. (Interestingly, SNAP's price per user metric is barely half that of FB.) And Snap's valuation - impacted by post-IPO volatility - likely isn't as true as that of FB stock.More established peers still highlight an apparent discount for Facebook stock, however.Amazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) trades at 65x 2018 analyst estimates - a multiple more thantriplethat of FB.Netflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX) is in the same range.Both those companies have higher projected growth and lower margins - which implies room to ramp up earnings once those businesses mature. It's hardly the case that FB stock should trade at the same levels. But the comparison also seems to imply that Facebook stock is a safer play: while investors in AMZN and NFLX are betting on growth years out, Facebook investors need only worry about the near future.FB Stock Versus GOOGLThe more interesting comparison is between FB andAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL). Alphabet has growth worries of its own, as falling per-click ad rates have pressured margins for some time. Beyond the core search business, Google's initiatives have had mixed success. Investments in self-driving cars and virtual reality are years, if not decades, away from bearing fruit. So-called IoT (Internet of Things) products like Nest and Google Home are facing tough competition from Amazon's Alexa and a number of startups.But Alphabet stock is valued right in line with Facebook's. Backing out the company's nearly $100 per share in net cash, GOOGL trades at 22x 2017 consensus and 19x 2018. Both figures are pretty much right in line with that of FB stock.That doesn't seem right. While Facebook has admitted to slowing growth in its core business, Alphabet's core business, Google, is seeing outright pressure.More broadly, the bet on Facebook stock versus Alphabet and Google is a bet on how consumers in the future will use the internet. And Facebook's continuing growth and global dominance appears to give it an advantage. That advantage - at the same valuation - would seem to argue for a long position in FB over GOOGL.Is Facebook a Buy Then?The fact that FB stock is cheaper than peers on its own doesn't suggest a buy. Some investors - and many analysts - believe SNAP is wildly overvalued. AMZN and NFLX have valuation questions of their own. Alphabet stock is at an all-time high as well. It's not impossible to be right that Facebook is cheaper than all those stocks - and yet still see Facebook stock decline, if by less than those peers.And there are risks specific to Facebook stock. The most notable is whether the platform can keep its dominance. Facebook may not be the nextMyspace- but it's likely that at some point, another social networking company will come along. Given the fickle tastes of younger consumers, in particular, the core question for FB stock is whether it will still bethedominant platform in 20 years, or even 10.Apple Inc. (AAPL) Can't Commit to HollywoodFor now, however, that risk seems priced in, and then some. We're nearing a point where the market is pricing Facebook like 'just another company' - but Facebook isn't just another company. It's a dominant global player, with huge margins. It's already profitable in a way that Snap and evenTwitter Inc(NYSE:TWTR) can only hope to be. And that dominance provides a huge moat around the business: if everyone already is on Facebook, it's even more difficult to get them to leave.So the market doesn't seem to be pricing FB stock accordingly - even considering the risk involved. A sub-20x forward multiple is fitting for a low-growth, established company. Facebook is established - but it still isn't anywhere near low-growth.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.More From InvestorPlace3 High-Yield Stocks of 14%-Plus: Are They Safe?9 High-Yielding Dividend Stocks To Safeguard Your IncomeThe postNo, Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Isn't Expensiveappeared first onInvestorPlace."

3 Reasons the Lowe’s Companies, Inc. (LOW) Stock Rally Will Continue;3/7/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOn the heels of a standout earnings report last week,Lowe's Companies, Inc.(NYSE:LOW) shares gained about 7%. It stood in stark contrast to many other retailers - likeMacy's Inc(NYSE:M) andTarget Corporation(NYSE:TGT) - that have struggled with the impact of e-commerce. Let's face it, the mightyAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) continues to wreak havoc on brick-and-mortar operators.makeArticleAd();Source:Mike Mozart via Flickr (modified)But so far, Lowe's has been immune. Then again, when it comes to home improvement, consumers still like to make a visit to a big-box location.OK then, so what about Lowe's stock now? Is there still room on the upside? Well, I think so. For the most part, the momentum looks sustainable for LOW stock. And here are three reasons to keep in mind:Reason No. 1 for Lowe's Stock: Positive Macro EnvironmentAgain, the latest quarterly report shows that the company is on a nice growth path. Note that revenues jumped19% to $15.78 billionand comparable sales rose by 5.1%. By comparison, the Street consensus was looking for revenues of $15.39 billion and comparable store sales of only 2.4%A key to the strength is the positive fundamentals for the home improvement industry. After all, there has been a steady increase in real estate prices, which has encouraged more spending.5 Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy in MarchAccording toLowe's CEO Robert Niblock: ""Expected growth in the home improvement market is further support of the results of our fourth quarter consumer sentiment survey, which revealed that post election, homeowners have an increasingly favorable view of the national economy and their personal financial situations and we believe this trend will continue, as almost half of the homeowners we surveyed indicate that they are very likely to begin a home improvement project in the next six months, and more than half of homeowners believe that home values are rising and will continue to increase.""Reason No. 2 for LOW Stock: Omnichannel SuccessIn the retail world, the concept of ""omnichannel"" is a common buzzword. It's essentially about providing customers with consistent experiences across in-store and digital platforms.Of course, LOW stock has been pursuing this strategy for some time, such as with a revamped website and improved mobile apps. Oh, and there have even been cutting-edge innovations with VR (Virtual Reality) and robots, which help answer questions in Lowe's locations.And the investments are really starting to pay off. During the latest quarter, the comp growth for Lowes.com jumped by 25%. Interestingly enough, digital traffic is growing at 15 times the store traffic since 2010 and mobile accounts for a quarter of overall traffic.LOW stock has also been skillful with leveraging online channels for marketing and branding campaigns. For example, the company's Pinterest page has over 3.4 million users. What's more, Lowe's has been active in creating engaging videos for platforms likeFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB),Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) TV,Alphabet Inc's(NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) YouTube,Amazon.com, Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AMZN) FireTV andRoku.Yet the omnichannel strategy has not just been about technology. Just look at the rollout of the interior project specialist program.Is Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Really Going to Crash 26%?This involves highly trained employees who help customers to plan, design and complete home improvement projects.Reason No. 3 for Lowe's Stock: Shareholder ValueDuring the fiscal year, the companyrepurchased $3.5 billionof Lowe's stock. And yes, the board recently authorized a new program for up to$5 billion in buybacks.As for the valuation on Lowe's stock, it is fairly reasonable. Keep in mind that the forward price-to-earnings ratio is 15X. By comparison,Home Depot Inc(NYSE:HD) trades at a multiple of 18X.Tom Taulli runs the InvestorPlace blogIPO Playbookand is the author of various books, includingTaxes 2017: Saving A Bundle.Follow him on Twitter at@ttaulli.

Why Baidu Inc. Probably Won't Spin Off iQiyi.com;3/7/2017;"In late February,Baidu's(NASDAQ: BIDU) video  streaming subsidiary iQiyi raised   $1.53 billion in fresh funds to compete more effectively with   rival sites. Hillhouse Capital, IDG Capital, Sequoia Capital, and   Baidu all purchased the newly issued convertible bonds, and Baidu   disclosed that it had invested $300 million.iQiyi is the largest video streaming site in China, but it   currently faces tough competition fromTencent(NASDAQOTH: TCEHY) Video andAlibaba's Youku Tudou. iQiyi has  been losing money since Baidu   purchased a majority stake in 2012, which has repeatedly sparked   calls for Baidu to sell or spin-off the company to boost its   profitability.The iQiyi app for Android tablets. Image source: Google     Play.makeArticleAd();Last December, theWall Street Journalreported that Baidu was planning to spin off iQiyi in an IPO   which could raise $1 billion. Baidu denied those rumors, and CEO   Robin Li reiterated after the recent bond offering that the site   was ""a great asset and an important part of the Baidu ecosystem.""   Let's take a closer look at iQiyi, and why Baidu prefers to raise   capital through convertible bonds rather than spin off the   company in an IPO.A brief look at iQiyi's historyBaidu and American private equity firm Providence Equity   Partners co-founded iQiyi in 2010. In 2012, Baidu bought out   Providence's stake to become the dominant investor. It acquired   the  popular online video business of PPStream the following   year, and launched its own film production division in 2014. That   same year, smartphone giantXiaomiand Shunwei Capital acquired a 10%-15% stake in  iQiyi for   $300 million.In 2015, it acquired the online rights to top entertainment   shows in China, Taiwan, and  South Korea -- including the   popular Korean variety showRunning Man. In 2016, iQiyi launched in  Taiwan, marking its first step   outside of mainland China.During last quarter's conference call , Robin Li stated that   iQiyi ""performed very well,"" with ""revenue and subscriber numbers   ramping up nicely."" According to iResearch's Dec. 2016 numbers,   iQiyi's mobile app remained the top video streaming app in China,   with 125 million daily active users and 480 million monthly   active users, and streamed 335 billion minutes of   monthly content.iQiyi generates most of its revenue from ads, but it launched   a paid service in 2015 that lets subscribers get earlier or   exclusive access to blockbuster shows. iQiyi claimed the service   reached 20 million subscribers last June, up from 5 million at   the end of May 2015.But profitability is toughOn the conference call, Robin Li stated that Baidu planned to   support iQiyi's ""further growth,"" but noted that higher content   acquisition costs at the site caused its total content costs to   rise from 5.6% of revenues in 2015 to 11% in 2016. That statement   raises some concerns when we look at Baidu's operating margins   over the past five years.Source:YChartsRobin Li still hasn't provided a timeline for iQiyi's bottom   line to break even, but CFO Jennifer Li noted that margins were   ""improving"", and that they would continue doing so in the future.   She also stated that to keep costs under control, Baidu will   invest more heavily in original content to ""further strengthen   and expand"" its subscription user base.YouTube faces the same challengesMaking a profit from streaming video is very tough. The   platform might generate revenue with ads and subscriptions, but   those gains often can't offset the costs of hosting videos on   servers and content acquisition costs.EvenAlphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) YouTube, the biggest streaming   video platform in the  world with over a billion users,   remains unprofitable due to those pressures. Last October,   YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki stated that the 12-year-old site was   ""still in investment mode,"" and that there was ""no timetable"" for   achieving profitability. Like iQiyi, YouTube offers a premium   subscription platform, YouTube Red, but the  service   reportedly only had 1.5 million subscribers at the end of last   summer.Baidu and Alphabet are willing to take losses on iQiyi and   YouTube for a simple reason: streaming videos tether more users   to their ecosystems. If those viewers use iQiyi they're more   likely to use other services -- like Baidu Maps, Search, and   Wallet -- instead of services from rivals like Tencent . Both   companies can also track watched videos, which gives them more   data for targeted ads.The key takeawayiQiyi will probably keep losing money for years, but investors   shouldn't fret over those losses. The platform brings more users   into Baidu's ecosystem, which widens its moat against other   companies and ensures that it remains the top internet   advertising platform in China. Therefore, investors shouldn't   expect Baidu to spin off iQiyi any more than they expect Alphabet   to spin off YouTube.10 stocks we like better than BaiduWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Will Salesforce.com, Inc. (CRM) Sell Out to International Business Machines Corp. (IBM)?;3/7/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSalesforce.com, Inc.(NYSE:CRM), whose rapid growth makes up for a compelling shortage of earnings, warned shareholders that its first quarter may not be what they hope for. Investors have yet to show their feelings by fleeing CRM stock, however.makeArticleAd();Source:TopoI6 Via FlickrInstead, analysts listened to the soothing tones of its earnings call, where the company bragged about its past and predicted $10 billion in revenue for the coming year.Few seem to have noticed the fine print.Profits for the first quarterare going to be down. That $10 billion in revenue is not going to represent much growth over the fourth quarter's $2.3 billion sale rate.Slower growth could hammer the stock, whose market cap of $57 billion means a price to sales ratio of 5.7, assuming the company meets its estimates. That's a ratio comparable to that ofAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL), only without the profits of Google.For CRM stock, the future is now. But perhaps, by forging an alliance withInternational Business Machines Corp.(NYSE:IBM), its future now might be in its past.Looking Beyond the CloudSalesforce has more than doubled its revenues since 2012 based on cloud applications. The company's ticker symbol, CRM, stands for Customer Relationship Management, the first major enterprise database application to move from corporate data centers into less-expensive clouds. But since then the company has built a full suite of such applications, and all have been successful.7 Stocks That Will Hit All-Time Lows in 2017The enterprise cloud has been very, very good for Salesforce.com, and competitors have done more than take notice. Cloud is now the default home of major database applications. Competitors likeMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT),Oracle Corporation(NYSE:ORCL) and IBM all now brag about the size of their clouds, and the sophistication of enterprise applications built on them.The S-shaped ""sales curve,"" of slow growth in a new market, rocket-like growth as mass markets adopt something and slower growth once that is achieved, is approaching the end of the line for cloud. CRM stock bulls insist that things like the internet of thingswill keep growth going, but each new niche now brings big-time competitors with it, such asGeneral Electric Company(NYSE:GE), which calls its industrial IoT cloud Predix.Alliance TimeAs markets mature, they consolidate. Competitors pair up, starting with alliances, then moving naturally toward mergers. Having fewer competitors means they can maintain pricing, and margins, even as growth slows.This is why some analysts are pushinga merger-of-equals that won't happenbetween Salesforce andAdobe Systems Inc.(NASDAQ:ADBE), whose ""Creative Cloud"" applications would seem a natural fit.Salesforce's strategy has been to pick-off smaller application spaces as they appear, as with its 2016 buy ofDemandware, which serves online merchants, acquired for $2.8 billion. The company made10 acquisitions during 2016, and in January it continued this withSequence, which designs user interfaces, a business now dubbed UX for User Experience.As a software house, rather than a hardware company, Salesforce has always had to manage its hosting carefully. Its original code came from Oracle, and the companies have had a fraught existence. So over the years, Salesforce has added Microsoft andAmazon.com Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) toits partner list, although these relationships are, like love, subject to change on the first suspicion of betrayal.Snap Inc (SNAP) Stock: Stay Away at All Costs!You canadd IBM to the list. Salesforce will now mix its data with IBM's Watson - a quick route into artificial intelligence and, perhaps, into IBM itself.Where the Ride Ends for CRM StockI believe the end of the ride for Salesforce is in sight and IBM would make a compelling destination. IBM now sells at half its sales, its revenues have been declining for years, and Salesforce could halt that slide. With CEO Virginia Rometty approaching 60, often a retirement age at Big Blue, Benioff might make a natural successor at age 52.Benioff would also give IBM a more entrepreneurial face, and IBM would give him a much bigger playing field on which to perform cloud magic. He has been telling all who would listen that a ""roaring"" market meansSalesforce is not interested in acquisitions.How about a sale?Dana Blankenhornis a financial and technology journalist.

Stocks recently featured in the blog includeJohnson & Johnson(NYSE:JNJ-Free Report),Alphabet(NASDAQ:GOOGL-Free Report),Schlumberger(NYSE:SLB-Free Report),Alibaba(NYSE:BABA-Free Report) andPublic Storage(NYSE:PSA-Free Report).Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations.Get #1Stock of the Day pick for free.Here are highlights from Monday's Analyst Blog:Top Research Reports for Tuesday: JNJ, GOOGL, SLBmakeArticleAd();Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ-Free Report), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL-Free Report) and Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB-Free Report).Johnson & Johnsonhave gained +15.8% over the last year, widely outperforming the large-cap pharma space (up +6.6%). J&J reported mixed fourth-quarter results, beating on earnings but missing on sales. However, the 2017 sales outlook was disappointing due to an expected slowdown in Pharma sales as a number of key growth drivers like Remicade and Concerta are facing competition.While the company is faced with a number of headwinds like unfavorable currency movements, increased competition from generics, pricing pressures and an uncertain global macroeconomic backdrop, the analyst believes that JNJ's diversified business model, deep product pipeline, lack of cyclicality and financial strength position it for continued momentum going forward. (You canread the full research report on Johnson &   Johnsonhere.)Alphabet's shares have lagged the Zacks Tech sector marginally over the past year gaining +19% vs. +19.7%, with the company's weaker than expected Q4 earnings report only adding to its underperformance. These headwinds aside, the Zacks analyst points out the company's good execution to date, more or less maintaining its dominant share in a competitive, fast-growing search market.The company's focus on innovation, strategic acquisitions and Android OS should continue to generate strong cash flows. However, the promise of Google's non-search businesses continue getting pushed into future even as the company's spending keeps rising. On Feb 23, 2017, Alphabet Inc.'s Waymo sued Uber and its subsidiary Otto, alleging intellectual property theft and patent violation. (You canread the full research report on Alphabet here.)Schlumberger's shares underperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas Field Services industry over the last one year, gaining +6.4% vs. the sector's +16% increase. The Zacks analyst likes the continuous and effective cost-management initiatives of the company. The Schlumberger-Cameron merger will support technology-driven growth, going forward. The company's focus on international markets also deserves appreciation. Schlumberger's current dividend yield of 2.5% has outpaced both 1.9% yield for its broader sector and the 1.4% yield for rival, Halliburton Company.However, commodity price volatility remains an overhang on the stock. Additionally, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter 2017 earnings has been revised downward over the last 60 days.

Alexa CAN Drive Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock … Someday;3/7/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) continues to roll along. AMZN stock trades just off all-time highs at the moment, having gained over 2,000% over the past 10 years.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockWhile some investors point to the price-to-earnings ratio of Amazon stock as a potential danger sign, I think that viewis short-sighted. The company's legacy business continues to change the face of U.S. retailing. Witness the sharp decline this week atTarget Corporation(NYSE:TGT), which seems directly attributed to Amazon's online success.Of course, online retail isn't the only area where AMZN is having success - or where increased profits can drive Amazon stock higher. The company's Amazon Web Services (AWS) business has become a dominant player in cloud.And, of late, the company's Amazon Echo, built on the Alexa Voice Service, has added another layer to the bull case for AMZN stock.Though I remain bullish on AMZN, I don't think Alexa really changes the value of Amazon stock - at least not yet. Amazon is too big and Amazon Echo usage is too spotty, for Alexa and/or Echo to drive impressive sales or profit growth on their own.But both products highlight the success of Amazon's long-term strategy; Alexa, in particular, may become a bigger point of the AMZN story in the future.Why Alexa And Echo Aren't A Big Deal For AMZN Stock YetFor any other company, Echo would be considered a monster hit. Amazon hasn't broken out sales figures, but it did say in December that it had sold""millions""of Echo devices. An outside firm pegged the numberat over 5 million. With the average sales price for Amazon likely around $100 (including retail markup and sales of lower-priced Amazon Dots), that implies as muchas half a billion dollarsin sales for AMZN.10 Dangerous Dividend Stocks to Dump NowThat's a huge number - for anyone but Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN generated more than $135 billion in revenue in 2016, meaning Echo-related sales were likely a fraction of 1% of the overall total. Those sales almost certainly come at higher margins for Amazon than, say, shipping a book at the company's usually tiny markup. But from a profit standpoint, Echo seems likely to offer at most a 1%-2% boost, and thus little impact on the fair value of AMZN stock at the moment.Meanwhile, the long-term prospects for Echo aren't completely clear. Usagetends to diminish over time(a trend certainly seen in my household). Echo isn't necessarily being used as a shopping device, either. Rather, the predominant uses are to set a timer, play music, and listen to news summaries.All told, while I do think there's a strong bull case for AMZN stock, that bull case isn't necessarily predicated on Echo. I wouldn't expect that by the end of the decade, consumers across America are ordering Bounty paper towels via drone through Alexa.But that doesn't mean Alexa doesn't matter for Amazon stock.Why Alexa (In Particular) Could Be A Big Deal For AMZN StockOf course, part of the genius of Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos is that Amazon's moves aren't based on the short-term. For all the complaints about AMZN stock's P/E ratio, the company almost certainly could cut costs substantially, and boost earnings, any time it wants.But Amazon continues to play the long game. It continues to expand its addressable markets, taking chances on major successes. (AWS remains the most obvious case of how that strategy has played out well.)From that standpoint, Echo and Alexa are off to a strong early start.Ditch Bank of America Corp (BAC) Stock and Look for Greener PasturesAdmittedly, direct Echo revenues are a tiny fraction of overall sales, and Echo-directed e-commerce revenue appears small. But Amazon still benefits from both products. For one, Alexa gives the company a toehold in the important artificial intelligence (AI) space. It allows Amazon to take onApple Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AAPL) Siri as well asAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL). Google Home sits in second place at the moment.For Alexa, in particular, the opportunities go beyond Echo. Alexa appears in Amazon Tap and the company's Fire Stick. Amazon wisely has opened the platform to third-party developers. They have created thousands of so-called ""skills,"" which create a virtuous cycle. The more skills there are, the more valuable Alexa is. The more valuable Alexa becomes, the more skills are created. And the more consumers fall in love with the product.Where Alexa Goes From HereThat opens the door to the real potential value in Alexa.Alexa isn't about driving e-commerce sales through Echo. It's about creating the dominant AI framework in the world. Alexa can be used in automobiles, to allow for safer multi-tasking. There are endless potential industrial applications. Because AMZN wisely has opened that system, it's far more likely to see those applications than Siri or Google's AI.That'sthe value in Alexa: its possibilities seem almost endless at the moment. To be sure, that doesn't mean Amazon necessarily will make billions of dollars off Alexa in two years, or in twenty. That's not the point, however. The point is that Amazon.com continues to innovate, and continues to be an ever-increasing part of its consumers' daily lives. From there, the argument goes, the business end will take care of itself, as will AMZN stock.Certainly, it has worked so far.As of this writing, Vince Martin did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceiShares Nasdaq Biotechnology Index (ETF) (IBB) Is at a Crossroads5 Blue-Chip Stocks to Sell in MarchThe 7 Best ETFs for Market-Beating ReturnsThe postAlexa CAN Drive Amazon.com, Inc.

This Long-Term Trend Makes Facebook an Awesome Buy;3/7/2017;"If you want your marketing message to reach a broad audience,   there used to be no better option than national television   commercials. But the growth of digital platforms likeFacebook(NASDAQ: FB) andAlphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google make it easy to reach   hundreds of millions of people. What's more, you can target your   message so it only reaches the most qualified potential   buyers.That's why digital has been eating into television ad budgets   -- and why analysts expect that trend to continue for the   foreseeable future. eMarketer forecasts that digital advertising   spend in the U.S. will climb to $113 billion by 2020, while TV ad   spend grows much more slowly, reaching just $77 billion. Digital   spend just surpassed television last year.One of the biggest beneficiaries of the shift of ad budgets   from television to digital is Facebook.makeArticleAd();Image source: Facebook.A Super Bowl every dayFacebook COO Sheryl Sandberg once likened Facebook's reach to   the largest television event. ""We have a Super Bowl on mobile   every day,"" she said.And it's true. Facebook has 1.23 billion daily active users --   1.14 billion on mobile and 180 million in the U.S. and Canada.   The Super Bowl earlier this year attracted 111.3 million viewers   in the U.S.Granted the Super Bowl lasts something like five hours (more   if Tom Brady sends it into overtime). The average Facebook user   spends ""just"" 50 minutes per day across Facebook, Instagram, and   Messenger, the last of which doesn't yet show ads.However, the average American watches less television today   than they did a few years ago. View time across all age groups   fell 11% in the six years ending last fall. The trend is more   pronounced among younger people. People between 18 and 24 spent   35% less time watching traditional television during the second   quarter last year compared to the second quarter of 2010,   according to Nielsen.While Facebook isn't the only reason people are watching less   TV, it presents a very good option for advertisers looking to   replace that lost watch time.Facebook is taking a huge share of digital advertising   growthDigital advertising is growing rapidly, but that doesn't mean   all of that ad spend will go to Facebook. Nonetheless, Facebook   has done an excellent job winning those new ad dollars flowing   from television ad budgets to digital.In the third quarter last year, Facebook took 45% of all   digital advertising growth. Google managed to take 54% of   advertising growth, leaving just 1% of growth for everyone   else.Facebook is poised to continue capturing a lion's share of   digital ad spend growth in the future, too. Display advertising   is the largest form of digital advertising today, and eMarketer   expects that to remain the case in the future. Facebook holds a   wide lead in display advertising, bringing in around $12 billion   in the U.S. last year compared to less than $5 billion for   Google.Facebook is also working to attract more video content to its   platform, which fits nicely with the trend of shifting ad   budgets. Facebook is reportedly funding new content productions   for its platform in the hopes of seeding an entire ecosystem   similar to YouTube. YouTube has proven extremely lucrative for   Google, and Facebook wants in on the billions of digital video   adverting revenue it generates every year.Not only are ad budgets shifting from television to digital,   Facebook is one of the few companies that's been able to attract   those ad dollars thanks to its audience size, engagement, and ad   targeting capabilities. As the trend continues through the end of   the decade, that makes Facebook an awesome buy.10 stocks we like better than FacebookWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

YouTube TV Is Here: What Investors Need to Know;3/6/2017;"Image source: Getty Images.Americans are changing the way they watch television. More and   more customers are showing interest in over-the-top streaming TV   services. Over 200,000 people joinedAT&T's(NYSE: T) DirecTVNow in about one month.DISH Network's(NASDAQ: DISH) Sling TV has over 1 million subscribers.Sony's(NYSE: SNE) PlayStation Vue is also very popular.makeArticleAd();Now YouTube -- a subsidiary of Google, theAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) company -- is throwing its hat in   the ring as well. The company recently revealed YouTube TV, a   slightly differentiated television service that costs just $35   per month.Here's what investors need to know about YouTube TV.YouTube TV's channel lineup. Image source: YouTubeIt's missing a lot of traditional cable networksYouTube focused on signing deals with the big four broadcast   companies. As a result, cable-only media companies such asViacomandTime Warnerare missing from the bundle. No CNN, Comedy Central,   Cartoon Network, TBS, TNT, or HBO. But it does mean cable   networks owned by the big four -- ESPN, FX, USA, E!, and so on --   are all there.That's kind of the opposite approach of Sling TV. Sling   launched without any broadcast networks, inviting subscribers to   buy a television antenna to supplement the service.Importantly, local networks are limited in availability.   That's why YouTube TV is launching only in markets where the   media companies own the local broadcast affiliate. Sony tried   something similar before expanding nationwide with a reduced   price for subscribers where live local channels are not   available.Overall, the channel lineup is somewhat lacking compared with   competing services at around the same price point. Customers that   signed up early for DirecTV Now are receiving 100 channels for   $35 per month, and new customers can still receive 60 channels   for that price. PlayStation Vue customers can get a similar   set of channels for $35 per month, and Sling TV subscribers can   get around 50 channels for $40 per month.The limited geographical reach and channel lineup should   reduce the number of subscribers YouTube TV will attract.YouTube is a veteran at video streamingAlthough YouTube TV may lack some of the content available on   other platforms at similar price points and the geographic reach   of its competition, it has one major advantage. It already owns   leading technology in video streaming.All three of the aforementioned competitors suffered major   technical difficulties following their launches. DirecTV Now   received a lot of bad press as its servers were overloaded making   parts or all of the service unusable. YouTube, on the other hand,   already streaming 1 billion hours of video every day.Consumers may be willing to sacrifice some channels for more   reliable service. But YouTube still has to prove that it can   deliver where competitors failed.The bottom line for investorsYouTube TV is a somewhat underwhelming product at launch. With   a limited channel lineup and geographic reach, it's unlikely to   make any significant impact on YouTube's operations in the near   term.In the long term, however, getting a viable product out there   now could lead to a much better product in the future. YouTube is   already offering a few differentiating features such as unlimited   cloud DVR, AI powered search and personalization (likely backed   by YouTube viewer data), and the ability to split the account six   ways so different users get different recommendations. If YouTube   can get the content deals in place while maintaining competitive   pricing, it could be a big winner in the future.10 stocks we like better than Alphabet (C   shares)When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better     buys.Click hereto learn about these picks!*Stock Advisor returns as of February 6, 2017This podcast was recorded on March 2, 2017.Sean O'Reilly:Welcome toIndustry Focus, the podcast that dives into a different sector of the stock   market every day. Today is Thursday, March 2, 2017, so   we're talking about energy, materials, and   industrials. I am your host, Sean O'Reilly, and joining   me today via phone is Motley Fool senior auto   specialist, Mr. John Rosevear. Good morning, John!John Rosevear:Good morning, Sean! How are you, today?O'Reilly:Extremely well. It's good to hear your voice. It's been   awhile, a month or two, since we last had a podcast, and I   missed you, buddy.Rosevear:Yeah, it's been a few weeks.O'Reilly:I had to get you in here to answer an all-important question.Rosevear:What's the question?O'Reilly:You're the only guy I know who can answer this for   me. I hate driving, I live in D.C., it's very tiring, I   want to know when I'm going to get my self-driving car.Rosevear:Well, it depends on what you mean by get, and   really depends on what you mean by   self-driving, [laughs] unfortunately.O'Reilly:I'm not touching the wheel in my driveway.Rosevear:Let's back up and define some terms here. This system of   classification for things that assist drivers has become   pretty universal. It was developed by the Society of Automotive   Engineers in the U.S. The U.S. government has adopted   it, other governments have adopted it, it's the way all   automakers talk now. They categorize it in six levels that   are helpfully numbered from zero to five. A level zero system,   there's no automation, the driver does everything. This might   even include warning systems like lane departure warning. But,   the driver actually has to do everything. Level one is when   you get some basic level of driver   assistance, assistance that parallel parks for   you, that kind of stuff. That's a level one system.O'Reilly:Does that include anti-lock brakes? I'm surprised   that's on here.Rosevear:That's...O'Reilly:Eye of the beholder?Rosevear:The driver is still executing that. They count that as an   intervention system. It's when the car decides to break for you   that it starts to become assisted. These emergency   stopping systems that they have now where the radar is on   the front of the car, the levels one through five require some   level of sensing what's going on around a car. So, yeah, these   parallel park systems where the car spins the wheel for you and   backs into the spot, that kind of thing, that's a level one.   Level two is where it starts to get interesting. This is the   system where you're on the highway and the traffic jam assist   systems, maybe the earliest versions of Tesla's   autopilot, where you can kind of take your hand off the   wheel under certain circumstances, and the car will maintain and   adjust its speed relative to the cars around to you, and it   will keep itself in its lane. It's doing a little   steering and a little accelerating and decelerating on its   own. But there still has to be a human driver, the human   driver has to be ready to grab the wheel. In fact, a lot of   these systems require you to actually touch the wheel every   minute or two, or something like that. Level three is   when it kind of gets into self driving. This is a system that can   drive under certain conditions, we might say highway   driving, this is where Tesla's autopilot is starting to go,   this is where some of the systems,GM's(NYSE: GM) Super Cruise that will come out on Cadillac   soon, this is where it ends up, level three.O'Reilly:Super Cruise? [laughs]Rosevear:That's what they call it. That's what they've been   calling it for a few years, I'm not completely sure   that's what they're going to call it when it comes to   market. Anyway, the gist here is, it's self-driving until   suddenly it isn't, the driver has to be ready to grab the   wheel. That makes it a little tricky. We'll talk about that   in a minute.O'Reilly:The Motley Fool's Dan Sparks did that article about a year   ago, he lives out in Colorado and he has a Tesla, how   far did he get, 90 miles? I can't remember, but, I   don't think he touched the wheel on the freeway with that   thing.Rosevear:Tesla's official instructions with the original system where   you're supposed to touch the wheel regularly, they considered it   an advanced level two system. I think now they're into level   three territory. The border here is a little bit fuzzy. The   border to level four is not fuzzy. Level four is, the car is   driving itself, period. It does not need you, but it's   limited. Usually what it means is it's limited to an area   that's been mapped, we say it's been geofenced.   These systems tend to depend on very highly detailed 3D   maps that show stuff that normal maps don't show,   like exactly where the curb is within a couple inches and so   forth, so the car can navigate precisely, especially on   a city street. So, it's full self-driving, you don't ever   have to touch a steering wheel, but it only works where the   car has a map. Level five -- and we'll get back to this in a   minute -- is the full-blown thing. It'll drive itself   wherever you want under any conditions. If it's   snowing, it'll go up a mountain, whatever,   anything.So, what we're talking about in the near future is level   four, a car that will self-drive itself. This is coming soon. But   it's limited by its maps. The idea is, gradually the maps   will expand over time and you'll be able to drive --O'Reilly:Are there cities that are being mapped right now? I'm   actually surprised to hear this.Rosevear:Yeah, Pittsburgh is being mapped. This is where Uber is   doing their testing, a lot of it. This is actually where   Ford's new company they created as a start-up with a veteran of   Uber and a veteran of Google's self-driving car project running   it. This is basically Ford's software team for self-driving,   and they're in Pittsburgh. There's been a lot of mapping   done, interestingly, in Pittsburgh, because the   artificial intelligence lab at Carnegie Mellon is the   source of a lot of the research that went into this, so, a   lot of the people are there. There's some mapping going on   in San Francisco. I know GM's   cruise automation subsidiary is doing testing of level   four assistance in San Francisco, so they have mapping going   on. Then, there are companies mapping all over the place. Tesla,   I think, is automating some of this mapping with the sensors   on their existing cars. A company calledMobileye(NYSE: MBLY)  is going to start doing mapping with   sensors on their customers' cars, these are sensors for level two   systems but they can help do the mapping for level four. This is   going to start very soon, probably next year for Mobileye. There   are private companies trying to do this, too, hoping to   be able to sell the maps to the automakers or whoever. And, of   course, the big wild card in this is, of course, Waymo. Google's   been mapping for years and years. [laughs]O'Reilly:You've seen the cars? They look ridiculous, they have the   pole and they have the ball of cameras on the top, and they just   drive around all these cities. That's how I can see what   my dentist's office looks like from across the street.   They're mapping cities with that, too?Rosevear:Yeah. I think everybody is. And it's not just mapping for   Google Maps, it's mapping at a much more fine level of   detail, where is the curb, where is the speed bump, and so   forth, so the car knows what to expect as it's driving. The   idea is, a map is a fallback from its sensors. If it's dark   out, if it's foggy, if the lighter system is   being buggy for whatever reason, you can kind of fall   back on the maps. Because these are safety systems, there   has to be redundancy built in. That's the thinking.O'Reilly:So, when is this stuff coming out?Rosevear:Good question. Tesla constantly does these upgrades, and   they'll break into level four at some point. If I had to   guess, I'd say 2019. But I don't know for sure. They may not   even know absolutely for sure when they'll be ready to ship   it. There's also an interesting question there that with their   owners of their current models, they've been shipping stuff that   maybe has some bugs still in it for the owners to bang on.   And because Tesla owners tend to be early adopter types,   they're mostly cool with that. As Tesla moves into the mass   market with its upcoming Model 3, something else we've   talked about, I don't know if they're going to tighten it up   a little bit. They might. We'll see. But that might push   that data off. But, anyway, this partnership of giant   auto supplierDelphi, Mobileye, which is a machine vision specialist that   has done a lot of work around--O'Reilly:And but they are publicly traded, right? For our   listeners.Rosevear:They are. The ticker there is MBLY. Look them up, because if   you want a pure-play on self-driving, that's as close as it   gets. The third company in this isIntel, which is designing the processors. They're working   together on a level four system. We've talked about this   before. They will have this available to any automaker who wants   it by the end of 2019, they say. Now, the cars are going to   ship in 2019. These things are incorporated as the cars are   developed. So, probably late 2020, early 2021, people   will be shipping cars with this system in, but those cars   may not go to retail. [laughs]O'Reilly:What?! Will they hang out and not do anything? [laughs]Rosevear:Here's what, for instance, Ford is saying. Ford says,   ""We're going to mass produce a level four vehicle   starting in 2021."" Great. Then, they say, ""Yeah, but we're not   going to sell it at retail. This is going to be for car sharing   use in cities and ride hailing services, Lyft and Uber and so   on."" It's because of the maps. They only want to sell it   where they have the maps. CEO Mark Fields at Ford has said,   ""We're not even going to give it a steering wheel in this,""   so obviously it has to have the maps. Again, as the maps   expand, there'll be more. Ford is saying right now that they   think they'll have level four functionality in their retail   vehicles 2025-ish. But they always say that, Bill   Ford, executive chairman of Ford, always says, ""We throw out   these dates, but it's always earlier than I expect."" So,   we'll see. Right now they're saying 2025. So, yeah, he says,   ""This stuff moves much faster than we expect."" There's also   some other stuff going on. The thing to emphasize here, I   should back up a little bit, not all the automakers, not all the   tech companies talk about what they're doing. There will be   surprises here. This is just, what has been announced, what we   have seen, what we generally know is coming.O'Reilly:Yeah, once you go public with something you get held to   it in some capacity, and nobody wants to get egg on their   face.Rosevear:Right. And GM originally said they'd launch Super Cruise in   2016 --O'Reilly:They need to get a different name for   that. [laughs]Rosevear:Yeah, OK. They're a level three system. They came out a while   back and said, ""Wait a minute, we're not happy with it,   we're going to do more work and make it more advanced.   We're not going to set a firm date, but we think late   2017-18, probably around there."" But again, they are   not holding themselves to a firm date on that. In fact,   they're not holding themselves to a firm date on a lot of   this stuff. Mary Barra's thing is, ""We'll ship it when it's   ready."" But what we do know is that GM is planning to   actually start building a whole lot of level four vehicles,   reportedly in the thousands. These will be the electric Chevy   Volts. They will be fitted with prototype level   four systems, and they will go into this massive test   with Lyft in several different cities. So, when will   you get your level four car?O'Reilly:Which is why they invest in Lyft.Rosevear:Right. They own 9% of Lyft, it's something like that.   It's a major investment, certainly, for GM. But, when   do you get yourself a driving car? If you're in D.C., you   might get one in several months from now or a year from now, when   you summon Lyft with your smartphone and a Chevy Volt comes. Uber   is already doing this on a tiny scale in Pittsburgh. They   have 8 or 12 cars or something that are prototype   self-driving vehicles in their fleet. With these   things, there are two engineers on board. One is ready to   grab the wheel and the other one is taking notes on   everything that's happening with the system. And it may be   the same deal with these GM Lyft self-driving vehicles. So   it might not seem all that exciting because there's somebody   in the front seat, but the car is driving itself, is the   idea. This is a way to rack up a whole lot of test miles   quickly, if you have a whole bunch of these things out   there, you know?O'Reilly:Yeah. I can't wait to see all these Lyft driverless   cars handle all the roundabouts in D.C., that'll be a   treat.Rosevear:Yeah, they'll teach them. We call them rotaries up here in   New England, we have lots of them too. It'll be   interesting to see how they handle Boston, which is colonial   era streets in some areas of town. [laughs]O'Reilly:Yeah, they're made for horses, not driverless cars.Rosevear:Yeah. Well, they were made to walk in, or cow   paths, definitely not driverless cars. But, there's other   stuff in here, too. The wild card is Waymo, which is the   Alphabet subsidiary that used to be the Google Self-Driving   Car Project and has now been set up as a company to go into   business and commercialize this in some way. Who will   partner with them? They had this little deal with Fiat   Chrysler where Chrysler built them some Chrysler   Pacifica minivans as test vehicles that took on their   latest prototype system. They've been talking toHonda, reportedly. But of course, there's a certain view in the auto   industry that a deal with Waymo is a deal with the   devil because Google will want all the data. And then you're   an Android phone maker, and Google's making all the   money. That is a great fear. I think every auto CEO in the world   is mindful of the example of the phone   industry. [laughs] They don't want to give up the   data. I think that is actually a lot of the selling   proposition of the Delphi-Mobileye system, this is a system   developed within the established auto industry supplier   structure. We'll share the maps among our fellow automakers   and so forth, but we're not selling the data to   Google. [laughs]O'Reilly:What do you think has been going on there? Correct me if I'm   wrong, but Google has those tiny little white go-kart   looking driverless cars for years. The laymen, we haven't   gotten a hint of them trying to make a buck off of them   at all. It's weird.Rosevear:They hired, a while back, and executive named John Krafcik.   He had been the president ofTrueCar, and before that, he had been in the business for years. He   was with several automakers, in management   capacities, executive capacities. He's a guy who knows the   business, a good guy, smart guy. His job is to lead Waymo and   find a way to bring this stuff to market somehow. He's been out   there talking to automakers. He actually did a really big   presentation at the North American International Auto Show   in Detroit in January -- I was going to say last month,   but it's March now. He was talking about where their system   is and so forth. They have a solid prototype level four   system. I think he was there, in part, fishing for   automakers who might want to have conversation. It's   possible those conversations have happened and nobody   is talking about them. The ones that have made it into the   media are Honda and, of course, Fiat Chrysler, which is   a much more overt thing, because the latest test vehicles   are all Chryslers.O'Reilly:We don't have this as a note, so feel free to tell me   you don't know a ton about this, but I'm sure all of our   listeners are on the tip of their tongues with this, they   want to hear, what is Apple up to? They have that big   plan, and I've got a push notification fromThe Wall Street Journala year ago that Apple was going to build a car within   the decade, blah blah, then they pulled back on it, they're doing   testing again. What is Tim Cook scheming right now?Rosevear:Good question. Yeah, I remember when thatWall Street Journalthing came out.O'Reilly:You got the notification too, I'm sure.Rosevear:I did, and I actually poked a few sources and ended up   writing a big piece for The Motley Fool first thing on   Saturday morning after that broke, sort of, what does this   mean, can they actually do it, that kind of thing. And the   answer was, Apple has so much money that, of course, they   could start a car company, the question is, do they want   to?O'Reilly:Yeah, I remember you talking about that.Rosevear:Right. They can throw money at it. The full boat, it's about $10   billion to get to where Tesla is where they have a factory   and they're banging out cars and it's really high level of   quality and so forth. Full boat. That's Tim Cook's lunch   money these days. [laughs] Their cash load is   unbelievable. They can do anything. The question is, would   they want to? The margins in the car business, by   Apple's standards, are pretty lousy. A luxury car   business might make an operating margin of 10-12%. If   you're Porsche, you might make 16%. That's kind of the upper   limit.O'Reilly:So, is it possible that Google and Apple wind   up dropping the brains in these cars and calling it a day?   Google already, they must have tons of data on these cars   operating.Rosevear:Google has made it clear, John Krafcik came out and said,   ""We're not building cars, we're not going to build a   car factory, we are not building cars. We're looking for   partnerships, we are not building cars."" Apple hasn't said   anything, of course. Officially, this program doesn't even exist.   But the word was, a lot of the people who might have been on   the actual build-a-car side of the business have been let go.   People working on electric self-driving cars are in very hot   demand these days. So, none of these people are wanting for   employment. But it was thought that a lot of those folks   were let go, and they really ratcheted down the ambitions of   the program. They may be aiming to do something where they come   out, like Waymo, and offer a system that Apple-izes a self   driving car built by somebody else. It's possible that they   will find an automaker to partner with, and maybe offer that as a   deluxe ride hailing option. My thought when they were   originally talking about this was that they were going to build   the deluxe Apple version of robot Uber, where it's a little   bit more money but it's a nicer car, and it recognizes all   your Apple devices and it's this seamless experience, it sees   your iPhone and it automatically sets your seat and   your climate and your music and everything else and all this   stuff, it takes exactly where you want to go, and it's   just a subscription model, $500 a month for the Apple Car   service. That's where I thought they were going to go.   Others disagreed. Some of my fellow Fools who are also very close   watchers of this kind of technology and particularly   close watchers of Apple thought they might actually build a car   for retail Tesla-style.O'Reilly:Cool. We're about out of time, John. I want to give you   the last word. When am I magically going to get   my driverless car in my driveway?Rosevear:If you want a Tesla, you might get it by the end of the   decade. If you want a car from one of the bigger automakers,   it's probably a few years beyond that. Somebody may surprise   us and have a level four car out by 2020 or 2021 that has a   fairly big map. But I'm thinking it might be over the next   couple years after that that these start to be available for   retail. I suspect the first ones that come out, it will be an   expensive option on a luxury car.O'Reilly:Awesome. John, I cannot thank you enough, once again,   for your time.Rosevear:It's always a pleasure.O'Reilly:I have to imagine that as this continues to ramp   up, this will not be our last show about this topic.Rosevear:Oh, heavens no. We'll be talking about this for several   years to come. It's a big deal.O'Reilly:Awesome. Well, have a good day, John! Thank you,   again!Rosevear:All right. Take care, Sean!O'Reilly:Bye.

6 Things You Didn't Know About Baidu, Inc.;3/6/2017;"Many tech investors are probably familiar with the basic facts   aboutBaidu(NASDAQ: BIDU) -- it's the biggest search engine in China, it has   a growing ecosystem of cloud-based services likeAlphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google, and it benefited greatly   from Google's exit from the mainland Chinese market in 2010.Those are the bullet points in the growth story that boosted   Baidu stock by nearly 1,500% over the past decade. But today,   we'll take a look at six lesser-known facts about the ""Chinese   Google"" which many investors might have overlooked.Image source: Author's screenshot.makeArticleAd();1. CEO Robin Li cut his teeth in the U.S. tech     industryAfter earning a master's degree in Computer Science from the   University of Buffalo, Baidu co-founder and CEO Robin Li worked   at Dow Jones & Co.'s IDD Information Services and search   company Infoseek in the  1990s.At IDD, Li developed the software for the online version ofThe Wall Street Journaland invented his patented Rankdex site-scoring algorithm for    SEO rankings -- which currently powers Baidu's search   engine. At Infoseek, Li created the image search function, which   was subsequently used inDisney's Go.com network. After spending over five years at those two   companies, Li returned to China and co-founded Baidu with   investor Eric Xu in early 2000.2. Baidu is developing driverless carsLike Google, Baidu believes that autonomous electric cars   would be a natural extension of its data mining ecosystem. The   company started testing out driverless cars on public roads in   late 2015, and formed a driverless tech research center in   Silicon Valley last April.Image source: Getty Images.Baidu is powering these vehicles with a combination ofNVIDIA's automotive chips, HERE Maps, and its own AI algorithms. It's   currently outsourcing production of these vehicles to Chinese   automakers, and has declared that it will launch an autonomous   shuttle bus  by 2018.3. It's beefing up its AI effortsFor search engines like Baidu and Google, AI plays a key role   in recognizing images, analyzing search patterns, and deciding   what types of targeted ads will appeal to users. That's why Baidu   hired a lot of top talent in AI -- its chief scientist Andrew Ng   previously helmed the Google Brain AI project, and its new   augmented reality chief Qi Lu was previously an AI specialist atMicrosoft.Baidu hasn't been shy about challenging Google in the AI arms   race. In January, it pitted its AI program against Google's   AlphaGo AI in  a series of facial and voice recognition   tests in a live TV broadcast.4. Baidu owns a small stake in Didi ChuxingBaidu previously invested in Uber's Chinese division, but Uber   eventually retreated from the market due to tough competition --   especially from market leader Didi Chuxing. Uber sold its Chinese   business to Didi last August, but retained a 17.7% stake in the   new subsidiary. Baidu and Uber China's other  shareholders   received a 2.3% stake.That stake is small, but Baidu could boost it and more tightly   integrate Didi's services into its O2O (online-to-offline)   ecosystem. Didi could also play a key role in automating Baidu's   driverless cars.5. It owns a big part of CtripBaidu owns a 25% stake inCtrip(NASDAQ: CTRP) , the largest online travel agency (OTA) in China.   For years, Ctrip was engaged in a price war with its primary   competitorQunar(NASDAQ: QUNR) , which crushed both companies' margins.Baidu owned a 45% stake in Qunar, but it swapped that stake   for  a 25% stake in Ctrip in 2015 -- which effectively   merged the two companies and ended the price war. That move also   tethered Ctrip's services more tightly to Baidu's growing O2O   ecosystem.6. Baidu also sells smart bikesIn late 2014, Baidu introduced DuBike, a bike equipped with a   wide array of health and motion sensors which sync to a mobile   app. It also features on-board navigation signals, which let   riders follow directions without glancing at their phones, and   lets riders share their routes with friends. To top it off, the   entire system is powered by a rider's kinetic energy -- so the   bike never needs to be recharged.Baidu's DuBike. Image source: Baidu.The key takeawayThe heart of Baidu's business is still search-based   advertising, but that could gradually change as its efforts in   driverless cars, AI, its O2O ecosystem, and even smart bikes pay   off. Therefore, investors should keep an eye on these adjacent   efforts as the company trades blows with other tech titans --   likeTencentandAlibaba-- over the next few years.10 stocks we like better than BaiduWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Time to Go Long!;3/6/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsGoPro Inc(NASDAQ:GPRO) is a camera company, yet Wall Street experts expected so much more out the GPRO story. They even once labeled it as ""a YouTube killer."" I betAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) management wasn't too worried then. That exuberance marked the top for GoPro stock.makeArticleAd();Source:ETC-USC via Flickr (Modified)Now, GoPro stock gets a downgrade under $9 per share. I'm sure it's no coincidence that this coincides with the IPO ofSnap Inc(NYSE:SNAP), which had a successful offering last week. Money is probably flocking out of GPRO and into SNAP stock, perhaps to recoup some losses there.I think the two have little in common. GoPro stock is a play on a line of action cameras known for being rugged and for active outdoorsy people. We see videos of extreme base jumping pros to teens clearing a two-foot hedge in their front yard. So far, SNAP appears to capture more general scenarios.The hate for GoPro stock should abate eventually. It still has cool products with very few high-profile direct competitors. I don't have a lot of faith in management, but just like in the case ofTwitter Inc(NYSE:TWTR), I think someone will eventually figure the stock out. But for this morning, GPRO stock is down 7.8% on a downgrade from Goldman Sachs.Click to EnlargeBased on that logic, I want to risk a little on a speculative trade going long GPRO stock. I could risk $8 to buy the stock, but instead I will use the options markets to risk even less. My thesis relies on GoPro stock eventually becoming attractive to old fans who revalue their re-entry levels.I do have to note that GPRO is in danger of inviting more technical sellers if it loses these lows. So I will snipe out the entry, perhaps in two tranches.The Bet:Sell the GPRO Jan 2018 $5/$3 credit put spread. This is a bullish trade for which I collect 50 cents to open per contract. If successful, this trade would yield over 30% on money risked. I need GPRO stock to stay above my sold spread to win.Yes, it is a gamble to try and catch falling knives, especially one like GPRO. But I need to add a few speculative plays to my portfolio, and this one qualifies. Again, an underlying assumption is that GoPro will eventually survive. But I don't need it to thrive to profit.Usually, I like to balance my risk by selling upside risk. In this case, however, I won't. GoPro stock has fallen too far, too fast, and I would be selling risk at a severe discount. If GPRO bounced hard, I would face self-inflicted risk against my own thesis.Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Is the New Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN)I could juice my bet by buying upside calls, but I will wait out a few more trading hours to flush out an interim bottom. I don't want to turn this trade into an investment yet, however, since I've already said that I don't have much faith in GPRO management's ability.I am not required to hold my options trade option through their expiration. I can close them at any time for partial gains or losses.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director ofSellSpreads.com.

Top Research Reports for March 6, 2017;3/6/2017;"makeZacksArticleAd();Monday, March 6, 2017Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Schlumberger (SLB).Johnson & Johnsonhave gained +15.8% over the last year, widely outperforming the large-cap pharma space (up +6.6%). J&J reported mixed fourth-quarter results, beating on earnings but missing on sales. However, the 2017 sales outlook was disappointing due to an expected slowdown in Pharma sales as a number of key growth drivers like Remicade and Concerta are facing competition.While the company is faced with a number of headwinds like unfavorable currency movements, increased competition from generics, pricing pressures and an uncertain global macroeconomic backdrop, the analyst believes that JNJ's diversified business model, deep product pipeline, lack of cyclicality and financial strength position it for continued momentum going forward. (You canread the full research report onJohnson & Johnsonhere.)Alphabet's shares have lagged the Zacks Tech sector marginally over the past year gaining +19% vs. +19.7%, with the company's weaker than expected Q4 earnings report only adding to its underperformance. These headwinds aside, the Zacks analyst points out the company's good execution to date, more or less maintaining its dominant share in a competitive, fast-growing search market.The company's focus on innovation, strategic acquisitions and Android OS should continue to generate strong cash flows. However, the promise of Google's non-search businesses continue getting pushed into future even as the company's spending keeps rising. On Feb 23, 2017, Alphabet Inc.'s Waymo sued Uber and its subsidiary Otto, alleging intellectual property theft and patent violation. (You canread the full research report on Alphabet here.)Schlumberger's shares underperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas Field Services industry over the last one year, gaining +6.4% vs. the sector's +16% increase. The Zacks analyst likes the continuous and effective cost-management initiatives of the company. The Schlumberger-Cameron merger will support technology-driven growth, going forward. The company's focus on international markets also deserves appreciation. Schlumberger's current dividend yield of 2.5% has outpaced both 1.9% yield for its broader sector and the 1.4% yield for rival, Halliburton Company.However, commodity price volatility remains an overhang on the stock. Additionally, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter 2017 earnings has been revised downward over the last 60 days.

IBM to Commercialize Quantum Computing Using Cloud Platform;3/6/2017;"International Business Machines CorporationIBMrecently announced plans to introduce quantum computing systems and services in the commercial space under the brand name ""IBM Q"". The company will leverage its IBM Cloud platform to deliver these systems and services.We note that this is an industry-first initiative undertaken by the technology giant and could revolutionize the way computing is being carried out in the present context.International Business Machines Corporation Price and   ConsensusInternational Business Machines Corporation Price   and Consensus|International Business Machines Corporation QuoteFilling in the Market GapCognitive systems such as IBM Watson run on classical computers and are capable of finding patterns and insights by deciphering huge amount of data. However, in the absence of any such recognizable patterns, these systems are not of much use.This is where quantum computers come into play as they are capable of providing solutions to problems where recognizable patterns don't exist.Quantum computing has its applications in many fields such as artificial intelligence, financial services, cloud security, drug discovery and supply chain and logistics.What Does This Mean for IBM?As per a Market Research Media report, worldwide spending on quantum computing is estimated to reach $5 billion by 2020. Not surprisingly then, competition in the sector is intensifying, with the presence of major players such as MicrosoftMSFT, GoogleGOOGL, Intel, D-Wave Systems, Hewlett Packard and Lockheed Martin.However, IBM with its industry-first initiatives looks poised to carve a niche in this segment.Stock Performance OverviewShares of IBM have underperformed the ZacksComputer - Integrated Systemsindustry over the last one year. While the industry gained 33.8%, the stock appreciated 28.4%.The underperformance of the stock could be due to weakness in the company's traditional businesses and shift toward the cloud that is keeping margins under pressure.  However, we believe that IBM's endeavor in the rapidly growing quantum computing field along with its strategic initiatives will help the stock rebound in 2017.Zacks Rank and Key PickAt present, IBM carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the broader technology space is Digi International Inc.DGII, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Stocks recently featured in the blog includeAmazon.com Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN-Free Report),Google(NASDAQ:GOOGL-Free Report),Facebook(NASDAQ:FB-Free Report) andApple(NASDAQ:AAPL-Free Report).Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations.Get #1Stock of the Day pick for free.Here are highlights from Friday's Analyst Blog:Amazon to Install Solar Panels to Power DatacentersThe world is fast shifting to alternative energy and this is spurring demand for solar panels.E-commerce giantAmazon.com Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN-Free Report) is gearing up for its next project associated with renewable energy initiatives. This time, the firm will harness solar energy by installing solar panels on the roof of its fulfillment facilities across the world.Coming to the price performance, over the past year, shares of Amazon outperformed the Zacks categorized Electronic Commerce industry. While the industry gained 39.53%, the stock returned 45.91%.DetailsAs part of its commitment to advance green power, Amazon has plans of deploying large-scale solar systems on rooftops of more than 15 fulfillment and sortation centers in the U.S. this year. By 2020, around 50 data centers are expected to use solar energy to meet their power needs.Amazon said that these solar panels could generate up to 80% of the annual energy requirements of a fulfillment center depending on the project, time of year and other factors. The company already has a network of wind and solar farms in Indiana, North Carolina, Ohio and Virginia. Its largest wind farm is in Texas.Amazon's senior vice president of Worldwide Operations, Dave Clark, said ""As our fulfillment network continues to expand, we want to help generate more renewable energy at both existing and new facilities around the world in partnership with community and business leaders.""Focus on Carbon NeutralityThis initiative by Amazon is the latest in a string of clean energy investments made by U.S. technology giants in recent months. For quite some time, Amazon has been moving away from fossil fuels and focusing more on clean energy. It aims at reducing its carbon footprint and using more renewable energy to power its huge data centers. Moreover, the company can generate healthy returns from these solar and wind investments as there are many associated tax incentives.Infact many corporate behemoths including Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL-Free Report), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB-Free Report) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL-Free Report) are progressively moving toward alternative energy sources to lower their overall carbon emissions and cut their energy bills substantially.Also, several countries are increasingly relying on solar power to generate clean energy. Stringent environmental legislations on greenhouse gas emissions have also proved to be a boon for the solar power sector. Moreover, despite high initial investments, low operational costs and no fuel costs make these solar investments attractive.Amazon.com, Inc. Price and Consensus|Amazon.com, Inc.

This Odd Little Company Beat the Market in 2016. Is It worth a Look in 2017?;3/6/2017;"It's tough to know what to make ofRaven Industries(NASDAQ: RAVN) . This unique little company's stock jumped 62.7%   in 2016, handily beating larger peers like3M(NYSE: MMM) , as well as the S&P 500. But companies that defy   description can sometimes be hidden buys.If it's tough to describe Raven, it's even tougher to figure   out where the company -- not to mention its stock -- is likely to   head in 2017. That's partly due to a huge issue with the company   that should worry investors who are interested in buying   top-quality stocks.Raven Industries invented the modern hot air balloon. Image     source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();What it doesRaven Industries was formed in 1956, when a group of   businessmen leftGeneral Mills, of all places, to form an industrial balloon company. Over   the next few decades, Raven invented the modern hot air balloon   and dabbled in other materials science industries like fiberglass   tanks, parachutes, cold-weather sportswear, and utility truck   bodies. The company branched out into the businesses of flow   systems and agricultural control systems in the 80s and 90s.Today, Raven still manufactures balloons, covers, liners, and   films used in various applications from grain covers to   wastewater pit liners to industrial packaging. It also has robust   agricultural controls and radar technologies businesses. The   ""internet balloons"" developed byAlphabet's Google to bring broadband access to rural areas utilize   Raven's balloon technology.Even with its 2016 performance, Raven is still a small   company, with a less than $1 billion market cap. So, let's look   at how such a small-yet-diversified company managed to crush the   market last year.The Trump factorAs you might expect with a small-cap company, Raven's growth   was very lumpy throughout 2016, in sharp contrast to the much   larger 3M and the S&P:RAVNdata byYCharts.But as you can see, one of the biggest jumps of the year for   the company came, unsurprisingly, in the wake of Donald Trump's   upset win in the November election. Such a win was seen as a boon   forconstruction companiesbecause of a potential major infrastructure package, fordefense contractorsbecause of potential increases in military spending, and forenergy companiesbecause of the potential removal of environmental   regulations.Raven Industries operates in all of those fields,   manufacturing films for the construction industry, surveillance   balloons and equipment for the military, and films to contain   fracking waste. No wonder the market has high hopes for the   company going into 2017.Of course, considering the amount of opposition on Capitol   Hill to some of President Trump's policies and proposals, it   would be a risky bet to buy Raven's stock solely on speculation   about his agenda without more details about how it might be   implemented -- and whether Congress is buying in to his   proposals. But there's an even bigger risk for potential Raven   investors.The red flagRaven is in an unusual situation in that, as of early   February, it was in non-compliance with NASDAQ rules for failure   to submit quarterly reports to the SEC. Since then, the company   has filed five quarterly SEC reports, including amended Q3 2016   and full-year 2016 reports, as well as an amended Q1 2017 report   and Q2 and Q3 reports.The company hadn't held an earnings conference call since   March 2016, but it finally held one on February 16th. On   that call, as you can imagine, there was a heaping helping of   humble pie served up by CEO Dan Rhykus. ""I'd like to address our   reevaluation of our internal control framework and the controlled   deficiencies we identified,"" he began, before stating the   following:We are responding with the utmost urgency and diligence to     remedy the situation and to ensure that we maintain a more     proactive approach to adapting the changes in the future, so     that our framework design appropriate adapts to whatever     changes our business may experience in the future or to changes     in the regulatory environment. As we work to remediate     these material weaknesses and enhance our control's framework,     we will keep you fully informed and updated.Essentially, management discovered that ""The  Company's    controls  relating  to  the response    to  the  risks  of  material    misstatement  were  not  effectively    designed,"" according to the company's amended 2016 10-K.   Specifically, these control issues could -- and did -- lead the   company to misstate items including goodwill, long-lived assets,   income taxes, and inventories on its quarterly and annual   reports.While many of these misstatements were comparatively small --   selling, general, and administrative expenses, for example, were   revised upwards by just $20,000 for FY 2016 -- some were far more   significant. Long-lived asset impairment losses of $3.8 million,   for example, weren't even included in the original 2016 10-K, and   contributed to a $6.7 million drop in EBIT on the amended report.   That in turn helped to drop annual EPS from $0.23 (original) to   $0.13 (restated), a major change.What's of more concern than these identified issues, however,   is the possibility that there are other problems that haven't yet   come to light.Investor takeawayThere's certainly a case to be made that -- with its reporting   now up-to-date and with remediation efforts under way -- Raven's   troubles are behind it, and it's a safe investment moving   forward. Plus, the company's reported third-quarter earningswere actually pretty impressive. Operating income was up 175% year over year, for   example. So maybe I'm being overly cautious when I say that   I don't feel comfortable investing in Raven until it can provide   concrete assurances that it has its house in order (remember, the   company hasn't yet been able to guarantee the issues are   solved).In the third-quarter earnings call, Rhykus has promised to   keep investors updated, so I'll be eagerly awaiting those   updates. In the meantime, there are plenty of other companies   that aregenerating strong earningsthat don't seem to be having the internal problems that Raven is   having. If you're interested in materials science stocks, you   could consider 3M,despite its middling outlook. For now, though, cautious investors should probably look   elsewhere.10 stocks we like better than Raven IndustriesWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Apple Inc. (AAPL) Apple Music Just Can’t Catch Spotify;3/4/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsApple Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AAPL) Apple Music is a success by all counts, but one target still remains elusive.makeArticleAd();Despite impressive subscriber gains since its 2015 launch, AAPL's streaming music service has been unable to catch primary rivalSpotify. And in the latest sign that the competition is far from over, Spotify just announced it has hit the 50 million paid subscriber mark.Spotify Hits 50 Million Paid SubscribersApple Music and Spotify are considered to be the two big players in the streaming music war.Spotify launched in 2008, giving it a long lead in which to build up steam over Apple Music, which didn't go live until 2015. Despite that head start - and predictions that after its initial free three-month trial expired, Apple's streaming music service would see a big drop off of subscribers - Apple Music quickly began to gain obliterate Spotify's numbers.Apple Music hit 10 million paid subscribers after just six months,a milestone that took Spotify nearly six years to reach. Since then,Apple Music has continued to add paid subscribers at a rapid pace: 11 million by last February, 13 million in April, 17 million in September and 20 million in December.Apple Inc. (AAPL) Posts Best Q4 Apple Watch Sales EverHowever, despite the rapidly increasing popularity of Apple's streaming music service, Spotify stubbornly refuses to go away. In fact, rather than stalling or beginning to slip as many expected, Spotify's numbers have also been growing strongly.Spotify had roughly 20 million paid subscribers at the time Apple Music launched. This week, the company announced it hashit 50 million.In other words, Spotify is not going anywhere any time soon.A Little More CompetitionWhile the big streaming music battle has been between Apple Music and Spotify, many other competitors are duking it out for the dollars of music fans. And rather than scare off new entrants, the success of Apple Music led to a big new competitor taking a shot at the business.Amazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN)launched Amazon Music Unlimited last fall, matching Apple Music's basic subscription rates. But Amazon added a twist by discounting the service for Amazon Prime members and slashing it it less than half the regular $9.99 monthly fee for owners of its Amazon Echo smart speaker.Will Apple Music Ever Catch Spotify? (And Does It Need to?)The success of Apple Music isn't just about bragging rights.The streaming music service is part of Apple's Services division. That division is increasingly important to the bottom line. It provides recurring revenue, which helps to protect against shocks when hardware sales hit rough patches. In AAPL's most recent quarter, Services posted thestrongest year-over-year growth of any of Apple's divisions.2016 revenue numbers for Spotify aren't yet available, but the music streaming service has consistently lost money, including $176.9 million in 2014 and $188.7 million. Thesituation looked grim a year ago, with Apple Music growing rapidly. However, big increases in paid subscriber drove a revenue gain of80% to $2.12 billion. That marked a turning point in the outlook for Spotify's survival.With profitability a distinct possibility in 2017, Spotify could be in acquisition territory.Alphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL) andFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) have both been floated aspotential buyers. An initial public offering could also be in its future.Apple Inc. (AAPL) iPhone 8 Lightning Port Drama ContinuesRegardless, Apple Music seems unlikely to knock Spotify off the top of the streaming music charts, at least not in the near future.That doesn't mean Apple Music isn't a success. It quickly vaulted from zero to a contender for top spot in mere months and has continued to grow. As shown by the number of streaming music services that continue to attract paid subscribers, there is still plenty of room for multiple big players to make money.Apple Music will continue to drive revenue into AAPL's Services division, even if that coveted No. 1 spot remains elusive.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceFriday Apple Rumors: iPhone Delay, Qualcomm Lawsuit and iOS FeatureApple Inc.

There, Apple   doesn't just miss the top spot, but falls all the way to the   bottom of 13 ranked services.How bad is that result for Apple?To be clear, Brand Keys claims that its measurements translate   directly into future sales prospects and revenues. According to   independent metrics fromMarkets and Markets, cloud storage is a $24 billion market today -- and expected to   reach annual sales of $75 billion in just five years.In other words, it looks like Apple is leaving a lot of cash   on the table. The iCloud file-storage service is not pulling its   weight, or moving the needle for Apple. Instead, consumers with a   need for off-site file-storage tools prefer free services like   Brand Keys' category winner, Sabrecat -- or a plethora of   better-known options such as runner-up Dropbox, or third-place   finisherGoogle(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Drive.Apple is not only missing a significant market opportunity,   but leaving a lot of that cash for Google parent Alphabet to grab   instead.Apple CEO Tim Cook. Image source: Apple.Why is Apple missing the boat?Apple's iCloud is, in many ways, very similar to Google Drive   and Dropbox. All three services allow users to store nearly any   type of file in a centrally managed cloud server, accessible from   any networked computer. They all come with small storage limits   for a free account, all offer a terabyte of storage for $9.99 per   month, and come with various tools for managing your stored   files. But Apple does a few things differently.First and foremost, the easiest way to access iCloud content   is via an iPhone, iPad, or MacBook. In fact, signing up for an   iCloud account is part of the setup process for all of these   systems. Then, the service is integrated into your Apple   experience as the destination for system backup files, the   default storage location for files created in the iWork office   suite, and an option for storing user files in newer versions of   the macOS system.All of this is designed to keep users tightly bound to Apple's   multi-device ecosystem. Once you're in, it's not easy to get   untangled. Given Apple's massive market reach, especially in the   tablet and smartphone segments, this alone should make iCloud a   winner. Apple CEO Tim Cook introduced the package as ""a strategy   for the next decade"" in 2012.However, Apple never quite delivered on that grand ambition.   iCloud is reportedly ostracized by other working groups within   the company, starved of resources, and mostly seen as a necessary   evil. Apple is a product company, and iCloud is not a marketable   product on its own -- at least not in its current Apple-centric   form. So, this odd piece of infrastructure machinery is left out   in the cold.And there goes Apple's ticket to a $24 billion industry that's   also on a rapid growth tear.Google sure is building its Drive product into everything from   Gmail to mobile photo storage to storage space for corporate   accounts. Dropbox is doing the same, while on the lookout for   another buyout bid. And this market should only grow faster as   theInternet of Thingsgrows up, requiring acres of cloud-based storage space. These   companies treat online file storage as an important business,   valuable on its own merits.Apple doesn't. Hence, the company is holding back on promoting   iCloud, developing it further, or building it into other   products, when appropriate. Cupertino misses out on a major   growth story, with absolutely no loyalty from the customers who   do sign up.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Cisco (CSCO) Expands Its IoT Offerings Thanks to Jasper;3/3/2017;"Cisco Systems Inc.'sCSCOstock has been a consistent performer in the last 12 months. While the ZacksComputer - Networkingindustry gained 27.6%, shares of this technology giant recorded marginally better returns of 27.7%. This trend can primarily be attributed to improving revenues from subscription services as well as robust demand in the telecom sector.Meanwhile, the company is focusing on expanding its Internet of Things (IoT) division, as per a recent announcement at the Mobile World Congress (MWC), held in Barcelona.Based on its acquisition of Jasper Technologies in Mar 2016 Cisco is aiming at becoming a major IoT platform provider going forward.Notably, the platform has emerged as one of the biggest monetization assets for Cisco given the burgeoning demand for IoT.At MWC, Cisco announced that itwill now provide support for narrowband IoT low-power wide-area network (LPWAN), which has applications in the industrial IoT space. Moreover, the company inked a partnership with car-maker Honda and Bright Box, a European connected-car platform which will enable Jasper to breath life into Bright Box's infotainment centers that come as a standard fitting in many of Honda's European car models. It was also announced at the event that Cisco will collaborate with Samsung and Jupl (a health data startup) to develop a wearable device targeted at the elderly for health monitoring purposes.What Does this Mean for Cisco?As of today, on the verge of one year completion, Cisco's IoT unit has witnessed a whopping surge of 157% in enterprise customer additions, 135% increase in the number of devices that are being managed and a 42% advance in adoptions for Jasper's Control Center product.As per an IDC report, the IoT market is estimated to reach a massive $1.7 trillion by 2020 with nearly 30 billion connected ""things."" Given the huge potential the sector has to offer, the time is ripe to carve a niche and that's exactly what Cisco is doing right now.Not surprisingly then, there is stiff competition in the space with the presence of major players such as Alphabet's GoogleGOOGL, MicrosoftMSFT, IBM, Intel, Siemens and AT&T.However, with these announcements, Cisco looks poised to take on the competition head on which augurs well for the company in the long run.Cisco Systems, Inc.

Google’s Groundbreaking Oscar Nod Could Pave the Way for VR;3/3/2017;"Virtual reality (VR) is a technology that is still in the   early stages of adoption. While headsets are available, VR has   yet to gain wide acceptance due to the high cost of consoles and   equipment, and the lack of sufficient content. Additionally, the   technology is still largely unfamiliar to the majority of   consumers, who may have heard of VR but have yet to experience   it. All that may be beginning to change.Pearl is the first VR movie to be nominated for an Oscar.     Image source: Google.makeArticleAd();For the first time, a movie created specifically to be viewed   in VR was nominated for an Academy Award. Though the film didn't   win, it may act as a touchstone for consumers.Alphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google Spotlight Stories, a VR   storytelling venue, has for the last several years produced   360-degree and VR films in the form of animated shorts. This   allowed filmmakers to reimagine storytelling and for technicians   from Google's Advanced Technology and Projects group (ATAP) to   hone the nascent technology.Its Oscar-nominated short,Pearl, is centered on the life and times of a musical father and   daughter traveling the country in pursuit of stardom. The   animated scenes all take place from the point-of-view of a   passenger in the front seat of their car. The ground-breaking   film was directed by Patrick Osbourne who received an Oscar in   2015 for his work onWalt Disney's(NYSE: DIS)Feast, a short film about a man and his adopted dog, which debuted in   2014. This highlights a recent push by filmmakers and the movie   industry to embrace the technology.Meanwhile, legendary director Steven Spielberg is fronting a   new VR start-up, Dreamscape Immersive, which recently raised $11   million in funding from several Hollywood studios. Focusing on   location-based virtual reality, the company plans to open a VR   multiplex in Los Angeles later this year.This comes on the heels of a similar location-based offering   that is the result of apartnershipbetween Google andIMAX Corporation(NYSE: IMAX) . The companies joined forces to create a cinema   grade VR camera using Google's Jump platform which seamlessly   integrates 360-degree video into a panoramic view. Last month,   IMAX opened its pilot VR center in Los Angeles and based on its   early success, the company plans to open five additional test   locations by mid-year. This model incorporates original material,   as well as content that expands on big budget films, such as   Disney'sStar Warsseries,Lions Gate Entertainment Corp.'sJohn Wickmovies, andHasbro'sTransformersfranchise.Samsung Gear VR. Image source: Samsung.In another sign that VR is gaining a wider audienceNetflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) released apps for its leading streaming service   that will work with several commercially available headsets   including theFacebook's Oculus Rift,Samsung's Gear VR, and Google Daydream View.  The app features   a virtual living room where viewers can connect with the familiar   Netflix interface to select programs for viewing. Website   ScreenRant.com detaileda listof movies that lend themselves to VR, without being specific to   the technology. While Netflix is not providing any actual VR   content, this is an acknowledgement that the public may be ready   for more in the way of interacting with VR technology.VR is still in its infancy and it will be some time before it   gains widespread adoption. Hollywood is leading the charge with   location-based options that will supplement the home VR market.   This provides evidence that the technology is gaining ground, and   the tipping point may be closer than we imagine.10 stocks we like better than Alphabet (A     shares)When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

AMZN stock closed Thursday at $848.91, up 13% year to date, while soaring 53% over the past year.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockBut, the recent outage of Amazon's web-based Simple Storage Service (S3), which disrupted websites, apps and smart devices across the country, shows the Seattle-based e-commerce giant isn't infallible, after all. But, don't hold your breath thinking this glitch will put a damper on AMZN stock.According to the company's statement, the outage impacting the S3 cloud services was due to human error. An issue in the S3 billing process was being debugged by members of the Amazon Simple Storage Service team. In an attempt to rectify the issue, which involved taking down a small number of servers, one of the engineers entered an incorrect keystroke.""An authorized S3 team member using an established playbook executed a command which was intended to remove a small number of servers for one of the S3 subsystems that is used by the S3 billing process,"" Amazon saidin a statement on its website. ""Unfortunately, one of the inputs to the command was entered incorrectly and a larger set of servers was removed than intended.""The servers that were mistakenly taken down supported two other S3 subsystems, which triggered a widespread outage impacting government services, news sites, the Securities and Exchange Commission, Business Insider, Quora and Slack and a host of other institutions considered significant to the internet infrastructure.7 Stocks That Will Hit All-Time Highs in 2017It remains to be seen whether this issue will cause Amazon to lose any customers to competing cloud platforms such as those offered byMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) orAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL). To its credit, however, Amazon didn't try to hide behind its mistake, saying Thursday it was making several changes to avoid the potential of similar problems in the future.""We want to apologize for the impact this event caused for our customers. While we are proud of our long track record of availability with Amazon S3, we know how critical this service is to our customers, their applications and end users, and their businesses."" Amazon said in its statement. ""We will do everything we can to learn from this event and use it to improve our availability even further.""Bottom Line for AMZN StockThough Amazon might lose some support in terms of AWS being touted as best-of-breed cloud, AMZN stock won't be affected, given the many growth tailwinds Amazon still has. For fiscal 2017, Amazon is expected to earn $7.25 per share on revenue of $165.2 billion, marking year-over-year increases of 48% and 21.5%, respectively. As such, Amazon stock should continue to march toward $1,000 per share in the next 12-18 months, 18% returns.As of this writing, Richard Saintvilus did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 Dangerous Dividend Stocks to Dump Now5 Blue-Chip Stocks to Sell in March7 Stocks to Buy That Are ALMOST in Buffett Buying RangeThe postAmazon.com, Inc.

Amazon to Install Solar Panels to Power Datacenters;3/3/2017;"The world is fast shifting to alternative energy and this is spurring demand for solar panels.E-commerce giantAmazon.com Inc.AMZNis gearing up for its next project associated with renewable energy initiatives. This time, the firm will harness solar energy by installing solar panels on the roof of its fulfillment facilities across the world.Coming to the price performance, over the past one year, shares of Amazon outperformed the Zacks categorized Electronic Commerce industry. While the industry gained 39.53%, the stock returned 45.91%.DetailsAs part of its commitment to advance green power, Amazon has plans of deploying large-scale solar systems on rooftops of more than 15 fulfillment and sortation centers in the U.S. this year. By 2020, around 50 data centers are expected to use solar energy to meet their power needs.Amazon said that these solar panels could generate up to 80% of the annual energy requirements of a fulfillment center depending on the project, time of year and other factors. The company already has a network of wind and solar farms in Indiana, North Carolina, Ohio and Virginia. Its largest wind farm is in Texas.Amazon's senior vice president of Worldwide Operations, Dave Clark, said ""As our fulfillment network continues to expand, we want to help generate more renewable energy at both existing and new facilities around the world in partnership with community and business leaders.""Focus on Carbon NeutralityThis initiative by Amazon is the latest in a string of clean energy investments made by U.S. technology giants in recent months. For quite some time, Amazon has been moving away from fossil fuels and focusing more on clean energy. It aims at reducing its carbon footprint and using more renewable energy to power its huge data centers. Moreover, the company can generate healthy returns from these solar and wind investments as there are many associated tax incentives.Infact many corporate behemoths including GoogleGOOGL, FacebookFBand AppleAAPLare progressively moving toward alternative energy sources to lower their overall carbon emissions and cut their energy bills substantially.Also, several countries are increasingly relying on solar power to generate clean energy. Stringent environmental legislations on greenhouse gas emissions have also proved to be a boon for the solar power sector. Moreover, despite high initial investments, low operational costs and no fuel costs make these solar investments attractive.Amazon.com, Inc. Price and ConsensusAmazon.com, Inc.

Marissa Mayer Faces Yahoo Board's Ire for Security Breaches;3/2/2017;"Yahoo! Inc.YHOOboard has penalized CEO Marissa Mayer, calling her negligent of the security breaches that led to theft of personal information of over 1 billion users.The board has decided not to pay Mayer her bonus and stock reward. She is otherwise eligible for an annual bonus of up to $2 million and annual stock reward of millions of dollars.In Sep 2016, Yahoo announced that at least 500 million users were affected by a late 2014 cyber-hacking incident led by a ""state-sponsored"" actor. The stolen information included people's names, birth dates, passwords, and, in some cases, answers to personal security questions.Yahoo yesterday stated that an independent internal investigation has revealed that an unnamed foreign government backed hacker was behind the 2014 cyber attack and Yahoo executives had ""failed to act sufficiently"" upon discovery of the incident.The report criticized Yahoo's legal department for failing to timely analyze and investigate the matter followed by sudden departure of General Counsel Ronald Bell. Bells resignation, effective Wednesday, might be an indication of worse things to come. Bell resigned without severance pay.Mayer is already under pressure from users, investors and analysts over late admittance of this data breach and yet delayed data breach news worsened things up.In Dec 2016, Yahoo announced a separate, even more massive breach of user data. The Internet company disclosed that more than one billion user accounts had been hacked in Aug 2013.Yahoo! Inc. Net Income (TTM)Yahoo! Inc. Net Income (TTM)|Yahoo! Inc. QuoteVerizon Gains, Altaba SuffersThe breaches, two of the largest in Internet history, have already cost Yahoo $350 million. Verizon will now buy Yahoo's core internet business at a discount of $350 million for $4.48 billion.The newly negotiated deal will also make Altaba, Yahoo's new name post acquisition, responsible for all costs stemming from shareholder lawsuits and a regulatory inquiry of Yahoo by the Securities and Exchange Commission. However, Verizon and Altaba will split costs from all other hack-related lawsuits and government investigations.A Lot at Stake for MayerLosing a bonus and annual stock reward won't move the needle much for Mayer as she is already a millionaire after serving as a top executive at AlphabetGOOGL, then called Google and Yahoo.What will matter is the loss of reputation at repeatedly failing to turn Yahoo around, facing investors' ire and finally being held responsible for negligence following two of the biggest cyber-attacks in history.Over the last one year, Yahoo stock has outperformed the ZacksInternet-Servicesindustry. It returned 40.6% compared with the industry's gain of 12.3%.Zacks Rank and Stock Price MovementCurrently Yahoo carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Alphabet Could Be Berkshire's Next Tech Buy;3/2/2017;"After loading up onApple(AAPL) shares, couldBerkshire Hathaway(NYSE:BRK.A) (NYSE:BRK.B) buyAlphabet Inc.(GOOG) (GOOGL) shares next? Alphabet has been bought aggressively by multiple famous gurus. Buffett and Munger have commented favorably on the company's competitive position several times. The latest Berkshire shareholder letter indicates Buffett is very knowledgeable about the technology space.The fact that so many value investors are buying Alphabet at current multiples indicate it is a great business at a fair price. It is not immediately obvious how popular the stock is because Alphabet trades an A and a C share class, which are treated as seperate companies by lists put together through automation. They are economically equivalent, however, and if you add them up, Alphabet is one of the highest-owned stocks among the great investors tracked by GuruFocus.Back in 2009,Warren Buffett(Trades,Portfolio) talked aboutIBM(IBM), Apple and Google:makeArticleAd();""The chances of being way wrong in IBM are probably less, at least for us, than the chances of being way wrong in Google or Apple. I just don't know how to value them.I would not be at all surprised to see them be worth a lot more money 10 years from now but I would not buy either one of them. I sure as hell wouldn't short them either.""In addition,Charlie Munger(Trades, Portfolio) said:""Google has a huge new moat. In fact, I've probably never seen such a wide moat.""Munger added it was also filled with sharks. It is impossible to assess a moat without understanding competitors and their chances to successfully assault a company's market share. In this case, Munger might have seen the potential early while Buffett remained unconvinced. Buffett has alluded to his biggest mistakes as acts of omission.Bill Gates, formerMicrosoft(MSFT) chairman and a good friend of Buffett, stepped down in 2014. Microsoft runs the only real competition to Google search. Gates stepping down may have freed Buffett to learn about that competitive landscape from him.In additon, Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin and Chairman Eric Schmidt traveled to Omaha to talk to Buffett when setting up the new Alphabet structure, which is molded after Berkshire.Shortly before the trip, they brought in CFO Ruth Porat, who understands the tech founders' goals for the company.Buffett included the following paragraphs in the 2017 shareholder letter, putting my spider senses on red alert:""In 2002, entrepreneur Mitch Kapor asserted that 'By 2029 no computer - or 'machine intelligence' - will have passed the Turing Test,' which deals with whether a computer can successfully impersonate a human being. Inventor Ray Kurzweil took the opposing view. Each backed up his opinion with $10,000. I don't know who will win this bet, but I will confidently wager that no computer will ever replicate Charlie.That same year, Craig Mundie of Microsoft asserted that pilotless planes would routinely fly passengers by 2030, while Eric Schmidt of Google argued otherwise. The stakes were $1,000 each. To ease any heartburn Eric might be experiencing from his outsized exposure, I recently offered to take a piece of his action. He promptly laid off $500 with me. (I like his assumption that I'll be around in 2030 to contribute my payment, should we lose.)""This paragraph shows Buffett has been studying the tech world very hard and is open to the possibility the Turing test will be cracked by 2029. He also must have looked into the dynamics of driverless or pilotless technology, note the recent investment into airlines, to take on a $500 bet. I do not think betting against Buffett is generally a profitable endeavour. What jumped out at me is, apparently, Alphabet's chairman and Buffett recently spoke again. They must have spoken for quite some time for the subject of this casual bet to come up.All these factors have led me to speculate on the potential of an Alphabet investment.The pieces are falling into place.Buffett has been studying tech intensely.Berkshire has made a 180 as far as tech investments go.Buffett and Munger view Alphabet as having an incredibly strong moat.Alphabet's valuation is at an attractive level given the interest from the value investing greats. Porat is a great addition to the executive suite ,covering up pre-existing weaknesses in the team.Google executives have met with Buffett on multiple occasions and Schmidt talked to him recently.The one thing I could see keeping Buffett from making an investment is his distaste for stock-based compensation. Alphabet continues to dole it out like it is candy on Halloween.I would go as far as to say it would greatly surprise me if we do not see Berkshire buying a stake in Alphabet in the next five years.Disclosure: Author owns none of these stocks.Start afree 7-day trial of Premium Membershipto GuruFocus.Premium MembersThis article first appeared onGuruFocus."

Does Alphabet's Self-Driving Car Lawsuit Spell Disaster for Uber?;3/2/2017;"Last week,Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL)  spinoff Waymo sued Uber for   stealing some of its key autonomous car technology. It doesn't   take a lawyer to know that things don't look good for Uber, but   does this spell disaster for the ride-sharing company's   self-driving dream? Here's what you need to know.The not-so-secret dirty detailsNow that this is in the rearview mirror, it's clear we   should've seen it coming. According to Alphabet, former Waymo   employee Anthony Levandowski illegally downloaded 14,000 ""highly   confidential and proprietary files""  in December 2015 that   detailed the secret software and hardware designs   for Waymo's LIDAR system. LIDAR systems are being developed   as the ""eyes"" of most companies' attempts at autonomous vehicles,   allowing them to ""see"" the world around them via millions of   low-power laser beams blasted out every second. In January   2016,  Levandowski started his own self-driving company in   and, two weeks later , resigned without notice from Waymo.   In August 2016, he sold his company to Uber for $680 million.IMAGE SOURCE: ALPHABET (WAYMO)makeArticleAd();Levandowski and Uber might've managed to keep things under the   radar, were it not for a LIDAR component vendor (apparently   inadvertently) copying Waymo on an email to Uber, in which   attached documents bore a ""striking resemblance"" to Waymo's own   LIDAR designs.Alphabet knows a thing or two about computers, and the details   of Levandowski's data dig only served to make the alleged act of   design theft look even more provable. So what does this mean for   Alphabet, Uber, and the future of self-driving car stocks?Blinded by the smite?Lawsuits are a norm, not an anomaly, among major corporations.   Alphabet itself is under constant legal attack: At the moment,   it's facing antitrust inquiries in the European Union, Argentina,   India, Brazil, Russia, and South Korea, as well as patent   violation and intellectual property claims by the likes ofOracle. As a privately held company, Uber doesn't announce its legal   matters in a single spot, but a quick search turns up hundreds of   suits.On issues of intellectual property, in particular, lawsuits   can get particularly sticky. If proven guilty, Uber will likely   cough up buckets of cash to Alphabet since, in Alphabet's words,   Uber has avoided ""incurring the risk, time, and expense of   independently developing their own technology."" By Alphabet's   calculation, that includes the $680 million valuation of OttoandUber's entire self-driving program, since they believe it   would've otherwise stayed stalled.That counterfactual claim is hard to prove, and it may also be   difficult to disentangle Uber's own recent advances in   self-driving technology. It's impossible for Uber staff to forget   what they now know, and almost as impossible for them to even   determine whether what they know is Alphabet's or Uber's.A signal for self-driving car stocksImage source: Getty Images.More so than anything else, this lawsuit serves as a warning   for self-driving car companies and their shareholders. Alphabet,   Uber, and others are in a fierce competition to build the best   self-driving car out there, and any attempt to cheat will be met   with the full force of the law.But investors shouldn't equate lawsuits with bankruptcy.   Rather, they should take a ""buyer beware"" stance and ask whether   a given lawsuit is a warning sign of a deeper issue. An   intellectual property lawsuit could be an indicator of an overly   competitive company culture, a short-term issue, or even a lack   of creative talent. Which problem is at the root of the suit   could be a better indicator about the ultimate direction of the   corporate defendant's stock than the specific legal details. So   if you're an investor in autonomous car companies, remember to   look out for lawsuits, read into them the right things, and make   informed choices as you hunt for the biggest potential winners in   this increasingly competitive race.10 stocks we like better than Alphabet (A     shares)When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Why Apple Inc. (AAPL) May Have 1,000+ Engineers Working on AR;3/2/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThere is growing speculation thatApple Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AAPL) next big thing is augmented reality. Of course, the 10th anniversary iPhone 8 looms large as the critical hardware release this year, but the new iPhone could well be part of that Apple AR strategy. A new report adds more fuel to the fire, suggesting Apple may have over 1,000 engineers currently working on an augmented reality project in Israel.makeArticleAd();Source: NianticBusiness Insiderpublished a report based on a research note by UBS, suggesting augmented reality is likely to be ""Apple's next major product innovation.""The UBS Report on Apple AR ProjectUBS analyst Steven Milunovich points out the increasing frequency of Apple CEO Tim Cook's public comments about augmented reality.He has repeatedly stated that AR will be a much bigger deal than virtual reality, suggesting that Apple is not following the path ofFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) and its Oculus Rift VR headset. While suggesting that he believes augmented reality could be as big as the iPhone, Cook also points out that he doesn't see it as a standalone product, but more as a core technology that is incorporated into other products.That suggests the Apple AR focus is on implementing advanced augmented reality technology that could be part of the iPhone 8. There have already been clues that AAPL isup to something big with the new iPhone's camera. Apple has also acquired a number of companies working on technology that could be applicable to augmented reality, includingPrimeSense(3D sensing),RealFace(facial recognition) andMetaio(software-based augmented reality solution).7 Stocks to Buy That Are ALMOST in Buffett Buying RangeCiting industry sources, Milunovich says, ""the company may have over 1,000 engineers working on a project in Israel that could be related to AR."" Why Israel? Both PrimeSense and RealFace are Israeli companies. Keeping the Apple AR team in that country would minimize disruption, and remove it from snooping media in Silicon Valley.The UBS research note concludes that Apple's moves could result in ""moderate 3D mapping … and possibly an AR software development kit"" being available as early as the iPhone 8 launch.How Likely Is the Apple AR Project?Predicting AAPL product development is always risky because the company seldom confirms any details, it maintains a veil of secrecy around new products and some prototypes never see the light of day as an actual product release. Like that long-rumoredApple television.However, the fact that Tim Cook has been so vocal about playing up augmented reality suggests he is setting the stage for anAAPL augmented reality announcement.Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Just Succeeded Where Apple Inc. (AAPL) FailedThe number of people the analyst believes are currently working on the Apple AR project also lends credence to the theory that it is both real, and a big deal. Apple is a huge company, but a team of over 1,000 engineers still stands out. For comparison, in the lead-up to the Apple Watch release, it was reported that AAPL hadassembled a team of 100 engineersto work on that top-secret product.Then there's the reality - not AR or VR, but real life reality - that for the past decade Apple stock has been propelled by the iPhone. And the smartphone market is maturing. The 10th anniversary iPhone 8 will undoubtedly pay off with a big spike in sales, but that is unlikely to last. The company needs something compelling enough to kick off a whole new cycle of iPhone upgrades.That's the Apple AR project. If Tim Cook can convince people that augmented reality is our spectacular future, and Apple can deliver a compelling AR experience that's built right into an iPhone - no dorky headsets required, no additional equipment to buy and no VR motion sickness - then Apple stock is just getting started.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceWhat Is Apple Inc.

Chevron Corporation (CVX) Stock Is Going to Gush Higher;3/2/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOn Wednesday, March 1, the stock market made another explosive move higher after a generally well-received speech by President Donald Trump to Congress. Among the leaders of Wednesday's rally were energy stocks - includingChevron Corporation(NYSE:CVX) - which had largely been lagging for the year-to-date.makeArticleAd();CVX stock gained more than 1% yesterday, and now it appears to be set up for more upside through multiple time frames.Let's face it: Profitable trading and investing is no easy task, particularly consistently staying on the right side of the market over a longer period of time. However, a straightforward and repeatable process with a focus on the ""easy trade"" at any given point in time can dramatically simplify the task for traders.Often, I believe the ""easy trade"" can be identified by looking for new relative strength or relative weakness within the stock market's sectors and industry groups.Case in point? The energy sector of theS&P 500, as represented by theEnergy Select Sector SPDR (ETF)(NYSEARCA:XLE), has largely limped behind the broader U.S. stock market rally so far in 2017. But for the week-to-date, I'm noticing a pickup in relative strength that could ultimately lead this sector to play catch-up with the S&P 500.7 Stocks to Buy That Are ALMOST in Buffett Buying RangeAlthough this week is far from over and thus this newfound relative strength is still unproven, shares of CVX stock - at least in relative terms versus the energy sector - are exhibiting some promising price action.CVX Stock ChartsLook at the ratio chart below. I've plotted Chevron stock against the XLE, and we see that so far this week, CVX is attempting to break past diagonal resistance that has been firmly in place for the past few years.Click to EnlargeIn other words, this chart displays that CVX stock is a strong stock within a sector that is beginning to show better relative strength. This, I like.On the multiyear weekly chart, we see that Chevron - after breaking past the black horizontal as well as the 200-week simple moving average (red) in November 2016 - has since successfully retested this area around the $110 level and begun to bounce.Click to EnlargeIn many ways, this ""retesting"" of prior resistance is now taking the form of what I would label a bull flag pattern, which as the name suggests, implies a continuation higher in price. Through this lens, a next upside target is around the late 2016 highs near $120.Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Could Break $1,000 If ...Zooming in on the daily chart, we see that last week CVX stock found support at its 100-day simple moving average (blue) and on Wednesday attempted to break out of a multiweek sideways consolidation phase marked by the blue box.Click to EnlargeA break and hold above $114.50 would set Chevron stock up for a rally toward the aforementioned $120 area as a next upside target. Any bearish reversal from here - particularly a break below last week's lows near $109.50 - would call off this bullish setup at least for the near term.Like what you see?

Snap Admits It Has No Moat;3/1/2017;"A moat is one of the most important things needed for a   company to succeed. The term, coined by Warren Buffett, is a   flowery way of describing a competitive advantage, which will   protect the company's profits and market share (the castle) from   competing businesses.Snap(NYSE: SNAP) , by its own admission, doesn't have a moat.""In a world where anyone can distribute products instantly and   provide them for free, the best way to compete is by innovating   to create the most engaging products. That's because it's   difficult to use distribution or cost as a competitive advantage   -- new software is available to users immediately, and for free,""   management wrote in the company's S-1 filing.makeArticleAd();In other words, Snap believes the only way to compete in its   market is to out-innovate its competitors likeFacebook(NASDAQ: FB) and Google, theAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) subsidiary. But what we've already   seen is that simply being innovative isn't enough if a larger   competitor can just copy the innovation.Image source: Snap.Snap's ""innovation"" budget is significantly smaller than   competitors'Snap spent $184 million on research and development (R&D)   last year. That's nothing compared to Alphabet, Facebook, or evenTwitter(NYSE:TWTR) . Keep in mind, Twitter is reducing its R&D   expenditure.Company2016 R&D ExpenseR&D as a Percentage of RevenueSnap$0.18 billion45.4%Alphabet$13.95 billion15.5%Facebook$5.92 billion21.4%Twitter$0.71 billion28.2%Data source: SEC filings and company quarterly reports.To be sure, as a percentage of revenue, Snap reinvested much   more than any of its competitors. But it's unlikely Snap will   continue investing that high of a percentage of revenue into   R&D. It simply can't afford to if it wants to show investors   that it has any potential at all of becoming profitable at some   point.Snap's cost of revenue is its biggest expense, and it alreadycommitted to spending $3 billion on cloud   infrastructure over the next five years.Snap doesn't have the resources to out-innovate its   competition, even if it's significantly more focused than any of   them.Even if it does out-innovate...Snapchat is certainly an innovative app. It's changed the way   people communicate, and it quickly grew very popular. Growth has   slowed in recent months, however, as its competitors --   specifically Facebook -- have attempted to copy some of its core   functionality.Facebook has been trying to copy Snapchat ever since it tried   to buy the company way back in 2013. While several attempts were   unsuccessful, Facebook kept at it until it found a winner. Its   recent success withInstagram Storiesdemonstrates the risk Snapchat explains in its S-1. It must keep   innovating to stay ahead of competitors copying its product.But where Snap claims ""it's difficult to use distribution   [...] as a competitive advantage,"" Facebook is showing exactly   the opposite. It's developed a huge competitive advantage because   it has a launching pad for new products like Instagram Stories or   Facebook Live. The company went from nearly 0 to 100 million   hours of video views per day in just over a year and a half.To say distribution isn't a competitive advantage ignores a   significant part of the value of Facebook's massive audience.   While not everything it launches succeeds, the odds are stacked   in Facebook's favor. That's evident from the success of Instagram   Stories and other product features Facebook blatantly borrowed   from competitors like Twitter, such as live video and trending   topics.Distribution isn't a competitive advantage for Snap (at least   relative to giants like Facebook and Google), but that doesn't   mean it's not a competitive advantage for Facebook or Google.   That fact makes Snap's admitted lack of a moat even more of a   risk for investors.10 stocks we like better than Snap Inc.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

YouTube Tops 1 Billion Hours a Day: Can It Pass TV?;3/1/2017;"YouTube looks to take down television as the most watched format in the U.S.The Wall Street Journalreported users worldwide are watching more than one billion hours of videos a day on the online video platform.The one billion hours is partially the result of the artificial intelligence that is used to recommend videos and keep people tuned in. The number of hours watched has increased 10-fold since 2012, when YouTube started building algorithms that look into user data to give each user a personalized lineup of videos.Currently, TV still holds the title as the most watched platform in the U.S. with 1.25 billion hours people spent watching each day, while TV also beat YouTube and other online streaming services in revenue generated from ads. YouTube may not be far off on the hours but it still has a long way to go on revenue.The content on the website is generated by users all around the world, professional or not. These users are uploading 400 hours of video each minute, or 65 years of video a day to YouTube.YouTube Profits?It is not clear how much money YouTube is generating for Alphabet Inc.GOOGLThe Wall Street Journalreported in 2015 that YouTube generated about $4 billion in 2014 and that division is ""roughly break-even.""The video-sharing website makes most of its revenue by running ads before videos; however, it is not enough when taking the heavy cost of technology and rights to content into account. YouTube struggles to expand its core audience beyond teens and to gain users that visit YouTube.com daily instead of coming from other websites from links or embedded videos. The company relies on popular videos, music videos and content created by the users to gain traffic. YouTube's content tends to attract only a few population groups; as a result, not all companies are willing to pay for ads on YouTube, even when YouTube has one billion hours watched.While YouTube focuses on the content that its users put out, competitors like Amazon.com Inc.AMZNand Netflix Inc.NFLXfocus on licensing Hollywood-produced content and creating original programmingto attract a wide range of audiences.Next StepsHowever, the new deal between Alphabet Inc.and Comcast Corp.CMCSAmight increase the traffic on YouTube. On Monday, YouTube and Comcast announced that Comcast customers with the latest gear would be able to search and watch YouTube videos through their cable boxes.Google also helps YouTube tremendously in gaining new viewers with its enormous reach on the Internet. YouTube videos are embedded in search results and Google pre-installs the YouTube app on its Android software. The website is also starting to secure rights to sports videos and shows for children.On Tuesday, YouTube announced YouTube TV, their service to disrupt traditional cable providers. For $35 per month, users will be able to stream major broadcast networks like CBS, ABC, NBC and FOX. Users will still get YouTube's original programming and sports networks like ESPN.""Millennial love great TV content, but they don't want to watch it in the traditional setting,"" said Susan Wojcicki, YouTube CEO at YouTube TV's launch event.While YouTube is on pace to surpass TV in hours spent watching in the U.S., the company also focuses on their algorithms and software in identifying and catering the needs of their audiences. By expanding in this regard and working on their targeting, YouTube can become America's favorite visual platform.Everything You Need to Know About Snapchat BEFORE It Goes PublicmakeArticleAd();You may be curious about the buzz surrounding Snap Inc.'s IPO on March 2.

Amazon.com, Inc.’s (AMZN) AWS Outage Is a Big Deal;3/1/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsYesterday,Amazon.com, Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AMZN) vice president of cloud architecture strategy, Adrian Cockcroft, gave apresentation at a tech conference. Of course, he extolled the virtues of his company's cloud platform, called AWS (Amazon Web Services). Meanwhile, the service was experiencing a major outage.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockGranted, the impact on Amazon stock was fairly minor. Yet, investors should still be concerned. Let's face it, AWS is critical for AMZN stock.Last year, this business segment reported a56% spike in revenues to $12.2 billionand operating income came to $3.1 billion. There are over 1 million active customers. More importantly, Amazon Web Services essentially subsidizes the core ecommerce business - which has razor-thin margins - but also allows for the heavy investments in efforts like video/music streaming, Alexa and devices like the Kindle.7 Stocks That Will Hit All-Time Highs in 2017As for the AWS outage, it lasted roughlyfour hoursand resulted in the disruption of thousands of websites and cloud apps across the US. Some of the high-profile companies that were impacted includedApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL),Twitter Inc(NYSE:TWTR) andTwilio Inc(NYSE:TWLO).At the heart of this was the failure of the S3 system, which provides for the efficient storage of content. The irony is that AMZN could not even access its own dashboard to deal with the problems - since it was also hosted on the AWS platform!The Real Impact?It is important to keep the outage in perspective. For the most part, Amazon Web Services has a great track record, with uptime that is over 99%. As a result, whenever there is a major outage, there is quite a bit of buzz.Besides, AWS is a standout offering. Over the years, AMZN has added great features - such as for data analytics, AI (artificial intelligence) and improved security functions - and has also been diligent with lowering pricing. Yet, this does not mean the outage is trivial. It's reasonable to assume that there are many companies that are evaluating the situation. After all, should there be more usage of alternative systems?Well, I think so. Note that other internet giants are leveraging their own systems to provide cloud services, as seen withAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG). Google is even the main vendor for the fast-growingSnap Inc(NYSE:SNAP), which has signed a$2 billion contract.Oh, and many old-line tech operators have been investing heavily in their cloud systems. Just some includeInternational Business Machines Corp.(NYSE:IBM),Oracle Corporation(NYSE:ORCL),Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co(NYSE:HPE) andMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT). All these companies have key advantages like trusted brands, global infrastructures and massive customer bases.Interestingly enough, these companies also have something else: They provide hybrid solutions, such as a blend of cloud services and on-premise technologies. This means a customer can place their mission-critical systems on private servers, which would mean no disruption if there was an outage of AWS.Bottom Line for AMZN StockOK then, with the outage of AWS, there should still not necessarily panic. The market opportunity for the cloud is massive - with plenty of room for multiple players. What's more, the financial costs for the outage will probably be immaterial. According to Global Equities' Trip Chowdhry, he thinks that there could be a2% drop in revenues for the first quarter.Procter & Gamble Co (PG) Stock Remains a Good Bet for InvestorsIf there are a couple more outages, however, then the situation could get dicey. When it comes to cloud hosting, there aren't too many second chances.Tom Taulli runs the InvestorPlace blogIPO Playbookand is the author of various books, includingTaxes 2017: Saving A Bundle.Follow him on Twitter at@ttaulli.

Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Just Succeeded Where Apple Inc. (AAPL) Failed;3/1/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL) isn't exactly a direct competitor toApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL), but the former just eclipsed the latter, and seemingly out of nowhere.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');Source: GoogleOne of the worst-kept secrets in the industry has been Apple's determination to get into the TV business. The company has been working for years trying to put together an online TV service, hoping to offer 25 channels for between $30 and $40 monthly. That project seemed to have been put on hold when AAPL and broadcasters couldn't reach an agreement on price.But Alphabet has just succeeded where Apple failed.YouTube TV - live TV from over 40 providers including the big networks for $35 per month - is now official.YouTube TV Takes on CableYouTube TVwas announced on Tuesday. Launching ""soon"" in the U.S., this is Google's skinny TV bundle for cord cutters. The four major networks are onboard. So isWalt Disney Co's(NYSE:DIS) ESPN, along with regional sports networks. Google is also including some content from its premium YouTube Red service. All told, there will be over 40 different content providers - not bad for $35 per month.Subscribers get unlimited cloud DVR storage, search powered by Google's AI, six user accounts (three streams can be active simultaneously) and the ability to watch YouTube TV on a variety of devices including smartphones, tablets, PCs and Google Chromecast.Why Apple Inc. (AAPL) Will Become a Trillion-Dollar CompanyIn other word, this is pretty much what Apple has been struggling to release.YouTubeTV is Eerily Similar to Apple's Television PlansApple has to have been watching Google's YouTube TV announcement with dismay. Its rival beat it to the punch with the streaming TV bundle it had envisioned offering with the Apple TV.What makes it even more galling is how close YouTube TV is to what AAPL was negotiating.In May 2015, AAPL andCBS Corporation(NYSE:CBS) were in talks about a subscription Apple television streaming service, butmoney was reportedly a sticking point. In December of that year, CBS CEO Les Moonves confirmed toBusiness Insiderthat his network had been in talks with Apple, and were close to settling on a monthly price to charge consumers. Moonves was throwing around $35 - exactly the price that YouTube TV is charging.Apple balked. Apparently Google was waiting in the wings.Where Does This Leave AAPL and Its TV Strategy?At this point, Apple's entire television strategy seems to be struggling.There was hope that the new Apple TV that launched in 2015 would come with a streaming TV bundle. That didn't happen. Now Apple's set-top streamer is suffering from disappointing sales. The box costs twice what Google andAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) charge for their streamers, but lacks the 4K support rivals offer.Last year, AAPL was showing off anew TV appthat would serve as a hub for streaming content, tracking use across multiple services and devices. But it failed to get buy-in fromNetflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX), making its usefulness questionable.Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Could Break $1,000 If ...Google's YouTube TV launch is the icing on the cake.Where Can Apple Go From Here?Don't expect Apple to give up on its plans, of course.The signs of a renewed push toward taking over your living room began last month. Applehired the former head of Amazon's Fire TVto take over as the head of marketing for Apple TV. This move has raised expectations that AAPL will revamp its Apple TV hardware. It also freed up the previous head of Apple TV to helplead Apple's efforts to sign content deals- something he had considerable experience in from his previous role as senior VP of content distribution atHulu.While YouTube TV offers a fixed content bundle, AAPL had always pushed for subscribers having an option to choose their own bundle, Moonves says. If the company can accomplish that goal, it still can position an Apple television streaming service as being something unique.With YouTube TV, Google may have beaten Apple to the punch when it comes to being first of the tech giants to offer a cheap way to cut the cable, but the war is likely just beginning.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceWhat Is Apple Inc.

Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Could Break $1,000 If …;3/1/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAndroid, fromAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL), is the dominant mobile operating system. It runs on nearly nine of every 10 mobile phones, worldwide. But that's never really been a primary reason to by GOOGL stock … or at least not directly.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockFrom an investor standpoint, you would still rather buyApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) because Apple monetizes iOS the way a butcher monetizes a pig. Google, on the other hand, just gives its OS away to OEMs.That's not to say Google doesn't make any money off Android, though. Simply by offering its search engine and Google Play store through the software, GOOGL rakes in billions of dollars.But, the Android ecosystem is extremely fragmented. Compared toAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) - which runs its own store and hasits own browser and search engine- Google's take is a mere fraction.What if that changed? Would it mean anything to GOOGL stock holders?Controlling AndroidWhile Google is not yet charging OEMs to use its software, the company has been quietly trying to gain control of its creation. Management is pushing OEMs to deliver security updates on a monthly basis. This is important, as crooks push malware onto older, unpatched phones.7 Stocks That Will Hit All-Time Highs in 2017Google's newest handset, the Pixel, is designed to be as good as an iPhone. Reviews, however, have been mixed. The company is even trying to getback into Chinathrough its OEMs (the world's largest market tossed Google back in 2010 over censorship).Still, Google has its work cut out for itself.Samsung Electronic(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) dominates the Android market. OEMs and consumers see this fragmentation as an advantage, even though it allows bugs to multiply because they may appear on one device or brand only.The operating system itself is hopelessly fragmented. Google is only now rolling out its Marshmallow and Nougat versions of Android andstill developing the ""O"" version, while many users have devices that still run the KitKat version. My own Android phone runs on Lollipop, (simply because it lacks the storage to run anything newer).The way Google eventually gets its arms around all of this may be throughAndromeda, an operating system for both Android and its laptop Chromebook devices. Unifying software platforms would give Alphabet Inc the kind of power that Microsoft only dreamed of with its Windows operating system.Bottom Line on GOOGL StockIf Alphabetwereto start monetizing Android, would investors even notice?Alphabet continues to grow at 20% per year, powered by advertising on its main Search site and YouTube. The company brings approximately 25 cents of every dollar to the net income line, its balance sheet carries almost no debt, and operating cash flow is ridiculous ($36 billion last year alone, more than twice what it achieved just two years prior). In 2016, Alphabet had revenue in excess of $90 billion.Over the last year, the price of GOOGL stock is up nearly 17%, and the non-voting GOOG shares are up even more. The company's market cap of $577 billion trails only that of Apple. Six months ago,they were nearly level, but that was before Apple's recent run to new highs.Alphabet Inc CFO Ruth Porat's program of paring non-performing assets and forcing ""other bets"" (like the company's self-driving car unit, now called Waymo) to make it on their own has paid off. Google's investment balances have been growing steadily, along with its asset base.Why Apple Inc. (AAPL) Will Become a Trillion-Dollar CompanyWhat's most amazing is how Alphabet continues to underperform. Android is not a major profit center, and Google Cloud is often considered third in the market, behind Amazon and Microsoft. Google was late to the voice party with Google Assistant, which allowed Amazon to get the drop on it. Plus, the hardware line is loaded with ""me too"" products, and GOOGL leads in precisely zero categories.Still, Porat has performed well in providing discipline to Google executives, but she has not propelled Alphabet to market leadership outside of Search.If assets such as Android became true profit centers, GOOGL stock would be well on its way to $1,000 per share and becoming the first trillion-dollar company.Dana Blankenhornis a financial and technology journalist.

AT&T Inc. (T) Stock’s Relationship with Facebook and Alphabet: Friends, Enemies or Both?;3/1/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMajor telecom companies, likeAT&T Inc.(NYSE:T), have a complicated relationship with tech companies likeFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) andAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL).makeArticleAd();Source:Mike Mozart via FlickrTelecoms envy Facebook and Alphabet's profits and stock performance. Since January 2009, Alphabet stock is up 460%, while AT&T stock rose only 49%. And telecoms like AT&T particularly resent the fact that internet companies like Alphabet and Facebook gained these profits while piggybacking on the equipment the telecoms spent tens of billions of dollars installing. You wouldn't be able to access websites such as this one or Facebook without the help of a telecom, such as AT&T.On the other hand, when people access Facebook or search Google, they are using data, which means more business for telecoms.But tech companies hurt telecoms when they cannibalize their revenue with apps like Viber and Messenger and WhatsApp. Using WhatsApp is cheaper than sending a text message, and has causedtext message volumeto decline.Storm Clouds on AT&T's HorizonBut that's not all. Alphabet and Facebook now are looking to compete with the core business of telecom providers such as AT&T. Alphabet'sProject Fi, in collaboration withSprint Corp(NYSE:S) andT-Mobile US Inc(NASDAQ:TMUS), will free users from signing a contract with a single network. This allows users to switch between networks depending on which one has the best signal quality.8 of the Most Overrated Stocks on Wall Street Right NowAnd that's not all. Alphabet has more projects, includingProject LoonandGoogle Fiber, in the works. These also threaten telecoms like AT&T. And Facebook is doing likewise, withFree Basics,Express Wi-Fiand theAquiladrone project.Why are tech companies like Alphabet and Facebook doing this? Why don't they just stick to their core businesses, search and social networks?Well, Alphabet and Facebook derive most of their revenue from advertising. More people receiving access to the internet means more people viewing ads, and more revenue for Alphabet and Facebook's core businesses. If people can't access the internet, they can't bring the two companies revenue.Alphabet and Facebook want to see more people using the internet, and if this means using drones or balloons to bring access to remote regions, so be it. With greater availability of bandwidth, traffic on their websites will go up.So are Facebook and Alphabet threats to T stock? Well, yes, in some ways. But in other ways they may help telecoms like AT&T by pioneering open-source hardware and software-defined networking. They have their own reasons for doing so, and this could help AT&T by lowering the cost of equipment which AT&T uses.Facebook/Alphabet vs. T Stock: FriendsIn an article I wrote inNovember, I discussed Facebook and Alphabet's efforts to develop open-source networking equipment. Currently, companies likeCisco Systems, Inc.(NASDAQ:CSCO) make money by selling proprietary hardware and software to telecoms and internet providers like AT&T.Networking equipment has been described as a""black box,""where hardware and software are bundled together by the same vendor. Software from other companies might not run smoothly on one company's hardware. Companies like Cisco can earn high margins on these proprietary products. Routing equipment has not yet beencommoditizedlike other hardware, such as servers.But the development ofsoftware-defined networkingandnetwork functions virtualizationcould change this. These trends involve using open-source software and hardware instead of more expensive proprietary versions. Telecoms like AT&T can then save money by switching to cheaper, interchangeable""white box""switches and routers.Alphabet and Facebook are taking advantage of this, and making their own networking equipment.Facebook developed its ownSDNswitch, theWedge, and open-sourced the Linux-based software to go along with that, FBOSS. It made the design for the Wedgeavailable to the publicthrough the Open Compute Project. Customers can order this from contract manufacturers, which sell it at a low margin, cheaper than Cisco's products. Facebook also released an open-sourcetransponderthrough theTelecom Infrastructure Project, which focuses on networking hardware for telecoms.Facebook hopes that releasing these to the public will speed up innovation, which will in turn benefit Facebook, a major hardware user.Similarly, Alphabet built its own massivesoftware-defined network.How does this benefit AT&T? Well, GOOG and FB are pioneering a technology which promises to lower costs for T stock. Through itsDomain 2.0program, AT&T is taking advantage of software-defined networking and network function virtualization. Last year, AT&T announced its intention tovirtualize 75% of its network by 2020. These technologies allow it to do more with less. They appear to bereducing capexat AT&T, which would boost free cash flow and raise T stock. It also expects SDN and NFV to save it money onoperating costs.Facebook/Alphabet vs. AT&T: EnemiesBut GOOG and FB also may harm T stock by getting into the telecom business.GOOG'sProject Ficonnects users to the network with the best signal at the moment, whether that's Wi-Fi or 4G LTE offered by T-Mobile and Sprint. Normally, mobile phone subscribers must go with one service: AT&T,Verizon Communications Inc(NYSE:VZ), or others. This could force telecom operators to improve their signal quality in order to compete.Alphabet also offers Google Fiber, a high-speed fiber optics service available in some select cities in the United States. AT&T must feel threatened by this; last year AT&T andComcast Corporation(NASDAQ:CMCSA)sued Nashvilleafter the cityvoted to approveGoogle Fiber.Alphabet is also working on the previously mentioned Project Loon, an effort to deploy telecom equipment in balloons 20km from the earth's surface. Since the equipment in a balloon is higher off the ground than an LTE tower, it can provide a greater area with internet access.Facebook is doing likewise with the Aquila drone, Facebook Express Wi-Fi and Facebook Free Basics. Free Basics brings internet access to200 million peoplein countries like Brazil and the Philippines.Impact on AT&TThe harmful effects of Facebook and Alphabet on AT&T stock may be a bit overstated.Facebook has expressed its intention towork togetherwith telecoms to roll out 5G technology.Nick Foxof Alphabet has stated that Alphabet's intention is not to compete with telecoms and put them out of business. Indeed, Alphabet is cooperating withthree telecomsin Indonesia to test Project Loon.And Alphabet and Facebook may be doing telecoms like AT&T a favor by bearing some of the risk in these ventures. Telecoms are more conservative than Facebook and Alphabet and wouldn't want to bear these risks on their own. Telecoms like AT&T may benefit from the more efficient deployment of telecom equipment via balloons, which cover a wider area than towers.Also, many of these regions the two are targeting are regionswithout much internet access.Facebook and Alphabet wouldn't be threatening AT&T by bringing internet access to regions in Africa, where T stock derives little if any revenue.Could Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Take a Hint From Best Buy Co Inc (BBY)?But some of these undertakings, such as Google Fiber and Project Fi, will probably be a headache for AT&T and holders of T stock.So it seems Facebook and Alphabet could best be described as AT&T's ""frenemies.""As of writing, Lucas Hahn did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace7 MLPs to Buy With High (And Growing!)

Potential Stock Market Winners of 2025;3/1/2017;"If you're a long-term investor, you have to think on an   investment time scale that is more than a year or two away. The   greatest investments are the ones that can generate positive   returns for decades into the future. It sounds simple at first,   but when you start asking yourself questions like, ""Where is this   company/stock in 2025?"" it becomes much more difficult .So, we asked three of our contributors that very question.   Which companies do you see generating great returns for investors   all the way out to 2025? Here's a quick rundown as to why they   picked retail bankU.S. Bancorp(NYSE: USB) , solar panel manufacturerFirst Solar(NASDAQ: FSLR) , and water utilityAmerican Water Works(NYSE: AWK) .Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();A bank to buy and holdJordan Wathen(U.S. Bancorp):One of the best-managed banks in the country, U.S. Bancorp   has been left out of the post-election bank stock boom. That's no   fault of its own, though. After provisions for losses, U.S.   Bancorp enjoys a roughly 50-50 split of interest income and fee   income, making its earnings less sensitive to rate increases like   other banks that have seen their share prices surge.I think investors are undervaluing the downside protection   afforded by diversified sources of fee income, and overvaluing   the potential for higher rates to fuel bank profits. In effect,   investors are placing too much importance on what makes banks   great over the short term rather than what makes them great over   the long haul.U.S. Bancorp's historical underwriting performance tells the   tale of its conservative culture. At the depths of the financial   crisis, net charge-offs peaked at 2.17% of average loans in 2010.   Though it may seem unremarkable on an absolute basis, consider   that ""retail loans"" made up 33% of its loan book at the time, a   majority of which were clustered in credit cards and home equity   loans that ravaged banks across the country.U.S. Bancorp can play offense, too. Its deposit franchise   gives it pricing power to hold down its cost of deposits, which   recently averaged just 0.28%. On the asset side of the equation,   its commercial loan portfolio should generate incremental income   from rate increases.On a recent conference call, a bank executive pointed out that   its commercial customers were using an average of 25% of their   credit lines. One would expect that faster economic growth could   bring higher balances, higher benchmark interest rates, and more   interest income. U.S. Bancorp has everything investors could want   in a bank to hold for years at a time.The sun is still rising on this investment opportunityTyler Crowe(First Solar):The solar industry is a difficult-to-understand, and at times   frustrating, industry to follow. That's because it's both a   high-growthanda cyclical industry at the same time. The problem is, too many   investors simply look at it as the former and neglect to remember   the latter. While overall solar power consumption grows at   near-exponential rates every year, panel manufacturers like First   Solar go through fierce supply-and-demand cycles as new capacity   and new technology come online.This past year is a great example of an industry downturn. The   industry is still growing, but it hit a patch of slower growth   recently that brought down prices for new panels and   utility-scale projects. However, the industry is expected to pick   back up again in earnest as renewable sources such as solar have   moved so far down the cost curve that they are now competitive   with fossil fuel power plants even without subsidies. As   technology improves, costs will continue to decline, and solar   will be able to take a larger market share and expand margins.   Keep in mind, global electricity demand over the next 25 years   will require that we build 8 times the current generation   capacity in the U.S.This gives First Solar an immense growth runway over the next   decade, and it is one of the best-positioned panel manufacturers   and utility-scale power developers out there to reap rewards from   this opportunity. The company has one of the most pristine   balance sheets in the business, its low-cost, thin-film solar   panel design is rapidly improving its efficiency metrics, and it   is one of the only companies in the business whose returns on   invested capital have outpaced its cost of capital -- which is   essential for a company to grow and create wealth over time.The solar industry still very much looks like the wild west of   energy, with new entrants rising and falling quickly, but First   Solar is looking like the company that has the potential to turn   this fast-growing market into one that really generates long-term   returns for investors.As close to a sure-thing, long-term winner as it getsBeth McKenna(American Water Works):I believe American Water Works -- the largest publicly traded   water and wastewater utility in the United States -- is as close   as it gets to a sure-thing 2025 winning stock. Moreover, I   believe it has a good shot at significantly outperforming the   market over the next nearly nine years -- through the end of 2025   -- just as it has done in the nearly-nine years since going   public:Data byYCharts.Since its April 2008 IPO, American Water's total return of   376% has crushed the S&P 500's return of 108% and pulverized   the returns of popular stocksIBMandGeneral Electric. Moreover, it's also beat the 212% return of Google parentAlphabetover this period -- and in April 2008, this tech stock was   less than four years off of its hot IPO. These stats should help   dispel the widespread belief that all utility stocks are stodgy   slow-growers. Moreover, American Water's return leaves underwater   the solid 172% return of its closest peer,Aqua America, while also significantly beating the 158% return of   the largest electric utility on the S&P 500,NextEra Energy.I'm confident American Water's winning streak will continue   over the long term. The company supplies the most essential   product in the world, and it's the largest and most   geographically diverse player in its industry. These latter   attributes provide it with greater resources and opportunities   than its peers to more efficiently expand its regulated business   by acquisitions. The water industry in the U.S. is extremely   fragmented, which means the potential acquisition pool (pun   intended) is a very large one.10 stocks we like better than American Water   WorksWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Alphabet Explores Streaming Video Space, Launches YouTube TV;3/1/2017;"Rumors regarding the launch ofAlphabet Inc.'sGOOGLown streaming-video service have been doing the rounds for the past few months. The public announcement was finally made yesterday at an event held in Los Angeles.Though the news didn't move the needle much for the stock (closed at 844.93, down 0.6%), over the last six months, the stock has outperformed the ZacksInternet-Servicesindustry. It returned 6% compared to the industry's gain of 4%.The ServiceKnown as YouTube TV, the subscription-service will offer over 40 channels alongside YouTube videos and YouTube Red original content for $35 a month.Alphabet reached agreements with CBS, ABC, NBC and Twenty-First Century Fox for the purpose of programming for this new service.In addition, there are 35 affiliated cable channels including ESPN, MSNBC, Disney Channel, National Geographic and Fox News.StrengthsThe biggest differentiator seems to be the cloud-based DVR component that allows unlimited storage in the cloud for up to nine months.Not to forget the low price point that includes up to six accounts, each of which comprises a profile, personalized recommendations and a personal library. A member's experience will not get disturbed by the preferences of others.Other facilities include live programming and fast-forwarding on pre-recorded shows to skip ads.LoopholesAlphabet didn't strike deals with cable networks like Discovery, Turner, Viacom, A&E and AMC, which means that subscribers are missing out on History, Comedy Central, HBO, CNN, TNT, TBS, AMC and so on.Though YouTube unveiled plans to expand the service as quickly as possible, viewers from only those places will able to tune in where YouTube offers full live local broadcast feeds. There are no international expansion plans currently.Alphabet Inc. PEG Ratio (TTM)Alphabet Inc. PEG Ratio (TTM)|Alphabet Inc.

The price of less than $40 a month will certainly place its competitors in a spot of bother.As the company generates significant cash from operations and also holds a huge cash balance, management has the flexibility to pursue growth in any area that exhibits true potential.

The Snapchat IPO Will Be a Short-Term Winner, Long-Term Loser;3/1/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThis Thursday, theSnap Inc(NYSE:SNAP) IPO is expected to hit the markets. The current price range on the deal is $14 to $16, which means that the company could raise over $3 billion. It seems like a good bet there will be a nice move on the upside, but you will probably not get any shares at offering price.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockRather, you'll have to take your chances in the aftermarket, which can be dicey. So how should you approach SNAP? Ultimately, it depends on your time frame.Let's take a look at some potential strategies:Snapchat IPO: The Long-Term TradeA lot of investors are wondering: Will this be similar to the opening ofFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) orTwitter Inc(NYSE:TWTR)?After all, the performances are a stark contrast. FB has logged a gain of 254% since its debut while TWTR has lost a grueling 62%.8 of the Most Overrated Stocks on Wall Street Right NowUnfortunately, for the Snapchat IPO, I think there is a better chance that the returns will look more like the latter. Why? Snap Inc looks more like a niche operator. The 18-to-34 year-old category is certainly a valuable niche, as many advertisers have a tough time reaching this demographic, but the market opportunity may prove to be relatively small.According to Pivotal analyst Brian Wieser, the revenues from youth-oriented cable channels like MTV, VH1, Comedy Central and Adult Swim come to roughly$3 billion per year.Besides, if SNAP is unable to break out of its niche, the company will certainly be challenged in keeping up the growth of its user base. Actually, there has already been a deceleration. It went from 21 million net adds in Q2 of last year to only5 million by Q4.But there are some other issues that could be a problem for long-term holders of Snapchat stock:The net losses remain significant, coming to $514.6 million in 2016. This compares to revenues of$404.5 million.The competition continues to get tougher. To this end, FB's Instagram has been essentially matching many of SNAP's core features (and this may help explain the deceleration in the user growth). According to InvestorPlace contributorChris Lau: ""When FB launched Facebook Stories above the news feed, it took away a reason for millennials to leave the site and use SNAP. Similarly, Instagram Stories usage grew to 150 million daily active users in just five months.""There are signs that Spectacles, which are glasses that allow you to take photos and videos, may be losing much of their appeal. According to theWall Street Journal, SNAP recently closed a pop-up store in New York City where ""there were often more employees than shoppers.""SNAP has a contingent liability of$2 billion. This is what the company must pay - until 2022 - toAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) for cloud services.Public shareholders will not have the right to vote. This will mean it will be nearly impossible for an activist investor to get any traction if there are problems with SNAP.There is no headquarters, which could make it tough for allowing collaboration.Snapchat IPO: The Short-Term PlayWhile the risk factors mentioned above are downright scary, they probably won't amount to much during the next few months. If anything, the Snapchat IPO is likely to be a great vehicle for traders.One key reason for this is technical: The amount of shares on the market will be fairly small. This means it will not take much buying power to move Snapchat stock.Why Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Will Always Be Much Stronger Than SnapchatInterestingly enough, it looks like the company has been taking steps to keep the float tight. To this end, SNAP is requiring some investors to notsell 50 million of the 200 million sharesthat will be offered.Of course, there will be some other factors that will help drive the momentum. Keep in mind that SNAP likely has various deals lined up, which should gin up buzz over time. It also helps that there has been a dearth of IPO activity over the last year. Oh, and of course, the overall equities markets have been in a powerful bull mode, which is always critical for IPOs.Overall, things are lining up quite nicely for the Snapchat IPO, yet this is probably not a stock to hold on for too long.Tom Taulli runs the InvestorPlace blogIPO Playbookand is the author of various books, includingTaxes 2017: Saving A Bundle.Follow him on Twitter at@ttaulli.

The Pundits Are Wrong: Snap Is A Buy;2/28/2017;"ByToptal:Originally published onToptalbyValuation Expert Joe Matta.For those who haven't been following the news since Snap (SNAP) announced itsintentions to go public, the press cycle has been on a rollercoaster ride. Initial valuation estimates in the$20-25bn rangewere quickly followed by a few bolder claims that the IPO may fetch the company a valuationas high as $40bn. With this in mind, immediate post-announcement commentary was decisively bearish, and largely centered around the company's disproportionatelyhigh pricecompared to revenues of only $405m in 2016.As time has gone by, more thoughtful analyses have shifted attention over to Snap's growth prospects, and here significant concerns have emerged over the company'sslowing user growth, drawing comparisons to Twitter's (TWTR) lacklusterpost-IPO performance, and thus placing serious questions on the purported valuation figures. As a result, Snap has reportedlylowered its expectations, and certain estimates expect pricing to come as low as $14-$16 per share, implying a valuation of$16-19bn.makeArticleAd();Ahead of its expected pricing (anticipated onMarch 1st) we take a look at whether the rumored valuation makes sense, and provide our own guidance on where investors should be pricing the stock.We find that while overall market concerns regarding DAU growth are justified, the market is likely undervaluing the company's ARPU growth prospects and conclude that there is significant upside on the table for investors. For us, Snap is a buy.Growth is the answerAs mentioned, initial reports largely focused on comparing Snap's purported valuation to its revenues, which when compared to its peers, admittedly looks very expensive (table 1).But such an analysis misses the mark completely in two important ways. Firstly, many of the companies in Snap's peer universe are not directly comparable (Google (GOOG) (GOOGL) is a search company and Amazon (AMZN) is an online retailer, to name a few). Limiting the peer universe to Snap's most directly comparable peers, Facebook (FB) and Twitter, is a more appropriate juxtaposition (charts 1 and 2).But even when just limiting one's comparison to Facebook and Twitter, the maturity profiles of the respective companies are very different and must be accounted for. A fairer analysis would look at the metrics pre-IPO for all three (charts 3 and 4). In doing so, readers will notice that the relative valuation, albeit still expensive, looks less so than in the prior charts.There are still timing issues with such a comparison though. For reference,Facebook was eight years old and Twitter was sevenat the time of their IPOs. Snap is only five, and with 2-3 more years of growth under its belt, Snap could be a very different company.Moreover, Snap is a direct-to-mobile platform while Facebook and Twitter went public in a world in which desktop-delivery still played a dominant role. Considering the shift from desktop to mobile, Snap is entering a market with a growing user base (mobile taking share from desktop) on a delivery platform that is capturing increasing user engagement (charts 5 and 6).In summary, the different maturity profiles coupled with the different delivery platforms, both now as well as at IPO, make for a troublesome comparables-based approach when assessing Snap's valuation. Snap may look expensive when compared to its peers, but comparing to its peers is not the right approach.With the above in mind, a Snap-only analysis makes most sense. And such an analysis should almost solely be focused on one thing: growth. For any company at Snap's stage, growth is paramount to valuation, and to this end, there are fundamentally two things that affect growth going forward:1) Growth in Daily Active Users (DAUs), and2) Growth in Average Revenue Per User (ARPU)We look at these in turn.DAU Growth: Doubts LoomMuch of the more insightful analysis which emerged a few weeks after the filing has in fact focused on DAU growth. And the hawks are out in flock. Unfortunately for Snap,while initial user growth performance was impressive (chart 7), there has been a significant downtick in new users joining the platform in recent months. Despite outperforming both Facebook and Twitter in terms of user growth in the six quarters leading up to its IPO, Snap saw quarterly growth rates drop from double digit figures to only 7% in Q3 16 and, even more worryingly, to a paltry 3.3% in Q4 16 (chart 8).Management's justification for the following can be found in their S1, wherethey state:""The rate of net additional Daily Active Users was relatively   flat in the early part of the quarter ended December 31, 2016,   and accelerated in the month of December. Although we have   historically experienced lumpiness in the growth of our Daily   Active Users, we believe that the flat growth in the early part   of the quarter was primarily related to accelerated growth in   user engagement earlier in the year, diminished product   performance, and increased competition.The rate of net additional Daily Active Users accelerated in   the first half of 2016 compared to the second half of 2015,   largely due to increased user engagement from product launches   and increased adoption rates among older demographics and   international markets. This created a higher baseline of Daily   Active Users heading into the third and fourth quarters, so   incremental net additions within these quarters were more   difficult even with strong year-over-year growth. Additionally,   in mid-2016, we launched several products and released multiple   updates, which introduced a number of technical issues that   diminished the performance of our application. We believe these   performance issues resulted in a reduction in the growth of our   Daily Active Users, particularly among Android users and regions   with a higher percentage of Android devices. Finally, we also saw   increased competition both domestically and internationally in   2016, as many of our competitors launched products with similar   functionality to ours.""The above explanation thus emphasizes two key potential causes for the slowdown in growth: technical issues with their Android product, and/or increasing competition.The former,while problematic, would not be a significant cause for concern. One would think that a company funded to the tune of $2.6bn and withnearly 2,000 employees(many of them in engineering) would be able to solve this and revert the company's growth course back to what it was at the beginning of 2016.But the more worrying concern revolves around competition. Snap faces increasing pressure from competitors, particularly Facebook and Instagram, which, if unresolved, could continue to limit DAU growth going forward. In fact, it is no wonder that Snapchat's growth numbers began suffering in Q3 16 as this was exactly when Instagramlaunched Stories, a near-blatant copy of Snapchat's namesake.Unfortunately for Snap, data regarding growth in DAU by geography only lends further weight to the competition concerns. In fact, on a geographical basis, much of the slowdown in Snap's DAUs appears to have been primarily in the ""Rest of World"" region (chart 9). Given Instagram's significantly larger user base abroad (80% of Instagram's c.300m DAUs are international), one could see how the incentives for installing Snapchat diminishes as Instagram (and other competitors) begin to offer the key features that Snapchat has to-date sold itself on.To summarize, things don't look good for Snapchat from a DAU growth perspective. Not only was Q4 16 Snap's lowest growing quarter since the beginning of its publicly available data, but it was even slower than that of Facebook, a far more mature company (chart 10). Given these headwinds, Snap will have to effectively convince investors that it can address its decelerating quarter-over-quarter DAU growth if it wishes to hit the valuation numbers that have been publicized.Looking Ahead: Facebook Growth or Twitter Struggles?With the above in mind, our expectation is that Snap, going forward, will experience a user growth profile more akin to Twitter's than to Facebook's.While growth will be sustained by its continued popularity in the United States, competition from Facebook, Instagram andother international competitorswill continue to limit Snap's growth internationally.Our base case expectation is therefore for an average of 14.1% growth per year post-IPO, almost right in between Facebook's and Twitter's annual average growth rates of 19.1% and 10.3%, respectively (table 2). The primary source of the growth premium to Twitter derives from Snapchat's ability to innovate on product features better than Twitter (more on this below).ARPU Growth: Solid Start with Ample Upside RemainingWhilst the above DAU estimates are nothing for investors to get excited about, and fall largely in line with most market commentary, stopping one's analysis at DAU performance is shortsighted. In particular, it misses the key other side of the coin: ARPU. And when it comes to ARPU growth, we see a radically different story. Our view is that Snapchat will see strong ARPU growth going forward, driven by the following factors:A more monetization-friendly productA more advantageous position with a key user demographicA generally more monetization-focused management mindsetAll of these will in turn be boosted by general underlying strength in the mobile advertising space. We look at these in turn.Snapchat is a very monetization-friendly productOne of the most attractive features of Snapchat from an ARPU standpoint is that the product itself appears to lend itself very well, arguably better than its competitors, to monetization. The effectiveness of the platform is largely driven by Snap's ability to innovate on product features and stay ahead of the competition, and this has allowed Snap to build impressively strong positions in image sharing and in video.Looking first at image sharing, Snap has caught up rapidly with its competitors (chart 11) largely thanks to its ability to innovate with the format (initially with disappearing messages, later with filters, Stories, etc.). The implication of this is significant in that it has allowed Snap to lead the industry in terms of developing and delivering sponsored / branded content for this type of format. For instance, focusing on sponsored filters, Snap's ability to reach a large audience far exceeds Facebook despite its significantly smaller user base (chart 12).The growth in image sharing and the innovation surrounding its product features has positioned Snap favorably amongst advertisers, allowing Snap to strike important partnerships with verysignificant brandsworldwide. One of the examples of such campaigns that Snap highlightsin its S1relates to how Wendy's blanketed its U.S. stores with Sponsored Geofilters that promoted the Jalapeño Fresco Chicken Sandwich. Snap's measurement tool reported that the Sponsored Geofilter drove over 42,000 incremental people to a Wendy's location within seven days of viewing the Sponsored Geofilter.Perhaps more important than image sharing, Snap has developed a dominant position in video, converting it into aserious threat to Facebook. According to theKCPB presentation, as of Q1 16 Snap has surpassed Facebook in terms of daily video views despite its significantly smaller user base (chart 13).This success to date has been driven by Snap's unique approach to the video format. KCPB refers to Snaps approach as ""3V Advertising"": (1) Vertical - made for mobile viewing, (2) Video - a great way to tell a story, (3) Viewing - always full screen.The combination of these three has made video advertising that much more effective on Snapchat. In fact, according to the KCPB presentation, outside of Snapchat many video ads are ineffective with 81% of people muting the ads. However, Snap points out in its S-1 that on average, 60% of all Snap Ads are watched with the sound on.The above again points to Snap's effectiveness as a monetization platform as well as the management team's ability to keep innovating on product and stay ahead of the curve when it comes to marrying fun and engaging product features with monetization avenues. Arecent exampleof success with video would beGatorade's sponsored lens during the Super Bowl, a campaign which led to 60 million plays in total, 165 million views and an increase of 8 points in purchase intent.Snap has developed the ultimate trifecta - a robust advertising platform that combines communications (chatting), image creation and sharing, and video content. This has lead to numerous marketing campaigns achieving above average industry impact, performance and ROI. This should support rapid growth of ARPU as more marketers recognize these benefits and decide to move advertising dollars over to Snap.Snap is very strong with a key user demographicAs the pool of mobile advertising investment dollars rises, more advertisers are looking to target Millennials and younger demographics. In 2015, Marketers dedicatedover a third (34%) of their annual marketing budgetsto targeting these groups. That figure was likely even greater with teens and ""tweens"" included.The above phenomenon is largely because Millennials are expected to drive consumer spending in the years to come. Millennials are80 million strong, the largest demographic in the United States, andas of March 2015, also the largest demographic in the workforce.This of course translates into huge spending power. Estimates indicate Millennials could be spending$1.4 trillion annually by 2020and could inherit as much as $30 billion in the coming years. Even teens and tweens are generating significant spending power,spending as much as Baby Boomersin 2015.The issue advertisers face is that Millennials are moving away from traditional advertising channels to their phones (chart 14). Companies like Snap, as well as its competitors, provide an optimal channel through which to target these groups.Fortunately for Snap, they seem to have developed a very strong position in these age-groups. With 63% of Snap users in the 18-34 age category, and 22% between 13-17 years of age, Snap has captured the attention of a highly coveted marketing demographic (chart 15 - note: chart is from a 2016 comScore report, as such the data does not perfectly tie with Snap's latest demographics reported in its S-1).More importantly, Snap has become a leading platform in terms of its engagement within 18-34 age demographic (chart 16). Facebook is clearly a dominant player with massive reach and significant engagement, but Snapchat is the second leading platform in terms of average monthly minutes per visitor. As Snap continues to expand its reach and further penetrate this key age group, Snap should move higher and further to the right on this chart as it continues to threaten Facebook's leadership.This all bodes very well for Snap. The company has continued to rapidly expand its reach within the 18-24 category while also broadening its penetration within older age groups. As of December 2015, according to comScore, more than three-out-of-five 18-24 year olds now actively use Snapchat, with older age groups also on the rise (chart 17).With a dominance in the Millennial, Teen and Tween demographics, the second leading platform in terms of monthly engagement and further expansion of its reach within each of those key demographics Snap should receive an outsized portion of advertising dollars going forward. This should support rapid ARPU expansion in the coming years.Snap management is more monetization focusedPutting the above two tactical points aside, the most encouraging thing about Snap is that management has consistently shown a greater predisposition and knack for converting fun new product features into monetization avenues. In short: Snap management appears to be excellent at monetization.And the results bear this out. When comparing to Facebook and Twitter, Snap started monetizing earlier, and has grown faster in terms of ARPU than both of its comparables, despite being several years ""younger"" as a company (charts 18 and 19).Admittedly, claiming that Snap is simply better at monetizing than its comps is a subjective and difficult-to-prove assertion. However, if you believe this, then what makes this an even more interesting point is when you consider how much upside could still be left for Snap to capture. To this end, a simple side-by-side comparison of ARPU numbers with Facebook and Twitter suggests that Snap's ARPU could rise as much as 7x what it is today (chart 20).For us, Snap's impressive historical performance in ARPU driven by its clear ability to innovate in product and monetization, combined with the tremendous upside still there for the taking, points to strong and rapid catch-up in terms of ARPU in the years to come. It is therefore not surprising to us that after havingfailed to acquireSnapchat, Facebook has now reverted toreplicating its features consistently.Overall Industry Growth will keep supporting Snap ARPU GrowthAside from the intrinsic strengths of Snap as a company, it's also obvious that overall underlying industry strength will help sustain ARPU growth in the coming years (although the extent to which this will be remains a question).According to areport from IDC, ad spending is expected to grow from $652 billion in 2016 to $767 billion in 2020 with mobile specific spending growing 3x from $66 billion in 2016 to $196 billion in 2020. Social media marketing in particular is expected to grow 20% per year to $50.2bn in 2019,comfortably overtakingnewspaper advertising by 2020.Moreover,according to KPCB, there is a $22bn market opportunity in mobile advertising as it is the only growing outlet in terms of percent of consumption time. This should continue to encourage marketers to shift away from more legacy outlets like TV and print and into mobile (chart 21). Given that Snap's entire advertising inventory is on mobile, a growing pool of total mobile advertising dollars will certainly benefit Snap going forward.Rabbit from a hat: Ancillary product launches may add further upside to ARPUFor further revenue upside one can't overlook Snap's potential to develop ancillary products.Snap has already demonstrated a willingness to explore new product categories with the launch of Spectacles in September 2016, its first ever hardware product. New product developments outside of software could potentially provide Snap with a very interesting monetization model that is different from their competitors (FB is exploring VR) and a unique way of owning more of the user's share of mind.Spectacles are wearable glasses with a built-in camera that links seamlessly to a smartphone to create unique Snaps from a ""human perspective."" The company views Spectacles as an extension of Snapchat and intends to use the glasses to create a unique circular format for video as opposed to the standard rectangular viewing perspective (once again reinventing the standard video delivery model).Spectacles do generate revenue for Snap, but for 2016 the revenues were not material and, thus, not reported in the company's filing. Going forward, Spectacles could represent a much larger portion of Snap's revenue.It's unclear what other types of new products Snap is planning to bring to market, but Snap has demonstrated a strong ability to create innovative and sticky products that drive incremental user growth and revenue (chart 22). Expect each new product introduction to be strategic in driving user growth, enhancing user engagement, and increasing share of mind, all things that should bring create even greater revenue opportunities for Snap.ARPU Growth Going Forward: A Monetization MachineLooking ahead and given all of the above, our expectation is that despite slowing user growth, Snap's platform should support very strong ARPU growth going forward. We see Snap's ARPU catching up with Facebook's in the next five years, and it would not surprise us if it surpasses it further out. In other words, despite Twitter-like user growth, Snap is likely to experience more of a Facebook-like, if not better, ARPU growth profile.The biggest risk to this scenario playing out mainly relates to Facebook and other competitors' ability to replicate Snap's features both quickly and effectively. Should this be the case, Snap's leadership in product innovation will likely fail to spill over into significant ARPU growth. However, should competitors struggle to play the ""catch-up game"" well enough, Snap will likely see ARPU growth rates in line with what we predict below. The latter has been interestingly described as the ""Gingerbread strategy"" inthis article.With that in mind we anticipate two possible ARPU growth trajectories. Our downside case projections are more in line with other commentaries and essentially consider the latter scenario of product innovation followed by effective catch-up by competitors. The base case is instead predicated on management's ability to keep innovating on product, and competitors' relative ineffectiveness at copying such features.The numbers of both cases are displayed in table 3 below, but the highlight is that in our base case projections, we anticipate north of 50% CAGR over the next five years, with ARPU catching up to Facebook's 2016 numbers by 2019/2020.Putting This All Together: What is Snap worth?With all of the above in mind, we can now proceed to calculating our estimated valuation for Snap. We first look at what Snap's revenues will look like going forward, based on our DAU and ARPU assumptions outlined above, and then move into a valuation analysis using these revenue estimates.Financial ForecastsOur financial forecasts are summarized in Table 4, but the headline numbers we want to highlight are the following:DAU growth in between Twitter and Facebook's post-IPO   performance, reaching 246 million DAUs by 2019Strong ARPU catch-up and growth, reaching $6.88 per user by   2019, nearly equaling Facebook's current 2016 ARPU numbers, in   the Base CaseMore limited ARPU growth in the Downside Case, reaching $4.80   by 2019, in line with Twitter's current ARPU numbersTotal Revenues of $1.6 billion and $3.8 billion achieved in   2017 and 2018, respectively, in the Base CaseTotal Revenues of $1.3 billion and $2.7billion achieved in   2017 and 2018, respectively, in the Downside CaseValuationWe value Snap on an EV / Revenue basis using a target multiple range of 6.0x to 10.0x derived from the midpoint of the range between Facebook and Twitter current trading multiples. On the one hand, Snap's more limited DAU growth warrants a lower multiple than Facebook's, but on the other hand its more favourable ARPU prospects warrant a premium to Twitter's multiple. We apply these multiple to forward 2018 revenue estimates to account for Snap being a younger company than both of its comps. Our valuation estimates are summarised in Table 5 below, but the key takeaways are as follows:Despite limited DAU growth, our base case ARPU assumptions   imply a valuation of c. $30bn based off a 8.0x multiple on 2018   forward revenue estimatesIn our bearish case, we come out at $22bn on 2018 forward   revenue estimates, in line but still slightly above more recent   price targets.Overall, we see strong upside potential for Snap going   forward, with the valuation potentially rising to nearly $50bn   assuming greater maturity of their comps justifies using Snap's   2019 forward revenue estimates for the valuation, concluding that   this stock is a buy.Snap: Twitter growth, but Facebook ARPUIn many respects, one could say that the Snap IPO heralds a more general shift in social media platforms from building for user growth to building for user engagement and monetization. Since inception, Snap has always felt more like a blend between a traditional social media app and a gaming app. The more playful nature of the platform has in turn translated positively into monetization and ARPU growth, far more so than Snap's peers did at their equivalent stages of their lifecycle. Whether a purposeful management strategy or not, Snap seems better built for monetization.This of course is occurring concurrently with an increasing shift in advertising spend from traditional media outlets to online/digital and particular mobile channels. In many ways, it feels like advertisers are reaching the tipping point of shifting a majority of their dollars to social media and ""new media"" channels.As a result, we view Snap's future financial prospects very favorably, and per our analysis above, conclude that Snap is a buy. Snap's value is a function of being the first social media platform that has been built with advertisers in mind from the beginning.This opinion article is for informational purposes only, and   does not constitute investment advice.

Why Was This Analyst So Wrong About Twitter Inc?;2/28/2017;"Sometimes going against the grain with a contrarian view pays   off for Wall Street analysts. Other times, it blows up in their   faces and hurts investors who took their advice. The latter   recently happened to BTIG Research analyst Richard Greenfield,   who boldly upgradedTwitter(NYSE:TWTR) from  Neutral to Buy with a price target of $25 -- right   before the social network's dismal fourth quarter earningssank the stock.All analysts and investors eventually make bad calls, but   Greenfield's upgrade raised eyebrows, since it clearly went   against the popular view that Twitter was stuck in a terminal   decline. Let's take a look at why Greenfield believed that   Twitter could make a comeback, and why those bullish ideas might   be misguided.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();Why did BTIG believe in Twitter?Greenfield believed that several catalysts would help Twitter   recover. First, he saw a ""meaningful uptick"" in downloads of the   iOS app, which he attributed to the U.S. election and President   Trump's widely covered use of the platform. Second, he noted that   a recent CivicScience survey showed an increase in the app's   daily active users (DAUs). Greenfield cited those two factors as   evidence of higher user engagement.As user growth and engagement rebound, Greenfield believes   that advertisers and potential suitors could return. The analyst   doesn't ""expect immediate financial benefits"" in the first half   of the year, but believes that Twitter's ""second half 2017   revenues could exceed investors' expectations with 2018 well   above consensus.""Why were those ideas misguided?Greenfield's claim that iOS downloads were rising is true.   According to App Annie, Twitter's iOS rank in the U.S. surged   from  33th to 8th place between Feb. 29, 2016 and Jan. 20,   2017. Unfortunately, that growth quickly reversed after Trump's   inauguration, and the app slipped back to 26th place at the end   of February.Greenfield's claim that DAUs are rising was also confirmed in   Twitter's earnings report, which revealed that its DAUs rose 11%   annually during the quarter -- an acceleration from 7% growth in   the third quarter, 5% growth in the second quarter, and 3% growth   in the first quarter. However, Twitter left out one crucial   number -- the actual number of DAUs.That figure matters because Twitter's monthly active users   (MAUs) only rose 4% annually to 319 million during the quarter.   If Twitter's DAU growth is outpacing its MAU growth, it means a   small group of power users are tweeting more frequently, but the   platform still isn't reeling in casual users. Twitter also hasn't   made it easy for casual users to get started, since it still   hasn't adequately addressedcommon complaintslike its 140-character limit, non-threaded replies, and the   proliferation of fake and spam accounts -- all of which make   user-to-user interactions difficult.Why advertisers and potential buyers aren't coming     backSome of the company's decisions over the last few years have   set it up for an uphill battle in winning back advertisers and   potential acquirers.First, former CEO Dick Costolo pivoted Twitter toward a ""cost   per engagement"" model which let advertisers pay for only the   interactions (tweets, likes, retweets) that they wanted.At the time, Costolo believed that move would help it reach   smaller businesses with limited advertising budgets. Instead, the   move backfired and  allowed large customers to pay less   money for fewer clicks. Twitter still hasn't recovered from that   move -- that's probably why its core advertising revenues fell   0.5% annually last quarter.As for a buyout, CEO Jack Dorsey and previous suitors seem to   have abandoned the idea. In January,Alphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Googleagreed to buymost of Twitter's developer products for an undisclosed sum. That   sale indicates that Twitter could sell off non-core businesses to   generate fresh cash -- which might be attractive to companies   like Google, which value Twitter's tech but don't want its   stalled out user base, sluggish advertising business, and   controversies regarding bullying, trolling, and illegal accounts.   Dorsey'srecent purchaseof $7 million in shares also indicates that the co-founder   believes in  Twitter's long-term future -- which might mean   that a buyout is off the table.Beating estimates in 2017 and 2018 might not     matterLastly, Greenfield's suggestion that Twitter could beat   expectations in 2017 and 2018 isn't as bullish as it sounds.   Analysts expect Twitter's revenue to fall 6.4% this year and    rebound 7.5% next year -- indicating that Twitter's 2018   revenue will remain nearly flat from 2016 levels. Beating those   estimates won't put Twitter back on the track to higher   growth.Greenfield might believe that time will eventually prove his   thesis right. However, Twitter's slumping sales growth, the   sluggish evolution of its platform, and a CEO that splits his   time between two companies all indicate that things could get   much worse before they get better.10 stocks we like better than TwitterWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Better Buy: Facebook Inc vs. Netflix, Inc.;2/28/2017;"These two are in rare company. How many other organizations   have ruled the age of the internet quite likeFacebook(NASDAQ: FB) orNetflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) ? We spend countless hours on each site keeping up   with friends and binge-watching our favorite shows.In fact, with the addition ofAlphabetandAmazon, I think we'd be hard-pressed to find more influential companies   in today's society. That fact has not been lost on   investors. Over the past four years, both stocks have quintupled   in value.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();But which is a better buy today? That's a difficult question   to answer, though we can get a better understanding for what   we're buying by looking at the question through three different   lenses.Sustainable competitive advantagesIf I had one word of advice for beginning investors, it would   be this: Spend the bulk of your time investigating a company's   sustainable competitive advantages. Often referred to as a ""moat""   by investors, sustainable competitive advantages are what keep   customers coming back for more every year and consistently keep   the competition at bay.Netflix benefits from, as I see it, three different types of   moats. The first is the brand. The Qwikster fiasco not   withstanding, the company has won over legions of loyal customers   who appreciate the service and its original content. That   original content is key, as it is gets people hooked into the   Netflix ecosystem.Management is able to target its original content because it   has more data on our viewing habits than any other organization   in the history of the world. That also gives the company the   upper hand when it comes to paying for content from third-party   providers. Imagine the negotiating table: Netflix knows just how   popular certain shows are to its viewers and how valuable it is.   The other side has no idea. That asymmetry provides pricing   power.Image source: Getty Images.Finally, Netflix benefits from a sneaky type of moat I onlyrecentlycame to appreciate. Once customers sign on, the cost of the   monthly plan is so low -- and the payments fully automated --   that a user would have to be highly motivated tocancelhis/her membership.Facebook, on the other hand, benefits from one of the most   powerful moats in the world: the network effect. With each   additional member who joins Facebook, non-members are   incentivized to join as a way of keeping up with their friends   and family. It's a virtuous cycle that is in full effect. Even   though the company already has over 1billiondaily active users, its roster continues to grow -- up 18% year   over year.Not only that but Facebook gets essentially all of its content   for free. That's often underappreciated by investors. Imagine   what a boon it would be if Netflix never had to pay for its   shows.At the end of the day, both of these companies have powerful   moats. In years past, I would have given the nod to Facebook. But   my realization of how easy it is for Netflix to keep subscribers   -- and how effective original content is at bringing in new users   -- is enough to call this a draw.Winner = TieFinancial fortitudeWhile conservative investors love seeing cash returned to them   via dividends and more aggressive investors love seeing cash   reinvested in a company's growth prospects, there's something to   be said for cash.Every company will experience difficult financial times, and   the companies that enter those phases with lots of cash will   prosper. They will have the flexibility to outspend rivals and   gain market share, repurchase stock on the cheap, and even make   strategic acquisitions. Debt-laden companies will be in the   opposite boat, forced to satisfy the whims of their   creditors.CompanyCashDebtNet IncomeFree Cash FlowNetflix$1.7 billion$3.4 billion$0.2 billion($1.6 billion)Facebook$30 billion$0$10.2 billion$11.6 billionData source: Yahoo! Finance. Cash includes cash, short, and   long-term investments.Here, we have a very clear winner. Netflix is spending lots of   cash on its international expansion and original programing.   That's a great strategy because, as mentioned above, once   customers are locked in, they're a reliable source of recurring   revenue.But with that strategy comes financial fragility. Netflix is   free cash flow negative, while Facebook is a cash machine with no   long-term debt whatsoever.Winner = FacebookValuationFinally, we have valuation. While this isn't an exact science,   there are some straightforward metrics we can consult to give us   an idea of how expensive each stock is.CompanyP/EP/FCFPEG RatioNetflix340N/A1.6Facebook32341.1Data source: SEC filings, E*Trade. P/E represents figures from   non-GAAP earnings.Here again, we have a clear winner. Because of the   aforementioned spending, Netflix isveryexpensive based on traditional metrics.Facebook, on the other hand, looks like a pretty good deal at   today's prices. While a P/E of 32 would never be described as   ""cheap,"" the company increased earnings by 86% last year, and is   expected to grow by 28% moving forward.Winner = FacebookThe winner is...So there you have it: While both companies have powerful   moats, Facebook has a better balance sheet and appears to be a   better value at today's prices. You really can't go wrong by   investing in either, but I'm a much stronger fan of Facebook at   today's levels. That helps explain why it accounts for 14% of my   real-life holdings, while Netflix clocks in at just 2%.10 stocks we like better than FacebookWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Facebook Inc's Chatbots Hit a 70% Failure Rate;2/28/2017;"Facebook(NASDAQ: FB) is reportedly scaling back its chatbot efforts on   Messenger after the programs failed to fulfill 70% of users'   requests.The Informationreports that those requests couldn't be handled without human   agents, and bots built by outside developers ""had issues"" because   the ""technology to understand human requests wasn't developed   enough.""So instead of building a large ecosystem of chatbots, Facebook   will train Messenger bots to handle ""a narrower set of cases, so   users aren't disappointed by the limitations of automation.""   Let's see what this strategic shift means for Facebook's AI   efforts, and whether or not chatbots will ever become meaningful   tools for the social network.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();Understanding Facebook's AI strategyArtificial intelligence plays a vital role in helping Facebook   track users and deliver targeted ads. By using AI to scan a   user's status updates, photos, videos, check-ins, likes, linked   apps, and other data, Facebook generates digital profiles of   users which help it deliver targeted ads to their News Feeds. In   2013, Facebook launched the FAIR (Facebook Artificial   Intelligence Research) unit to continuously upgrade those AI   capabilities.That's where Messenger comes in. In 2014, Facebook forced   users to download the stand-alone Messenger app to keep chatting.   That move -- whichclearly mirroredTencent's(NASDAQOTH: TCEHY) WeChat -- laid the foundations for Messenger   to become a ""platform"" which could eventually offer ride hailing,   mobile payments, deliveries, games and other services from a   single app.Facebook's Messenger app. Image source: Google Play.That move would give Facebook an ""OS within an OS"" to counter   the iOS App Store andAlphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google Play. Facebook's next   step would be toreplaceapps with Messenger chatbots, which were introduced last April.   If that effort works, it could turn the entire mobile app store   model upside down.The premature rise of the chatbotsIn theory, a business chatbot could answer questions, make   purchase suggestions, process orders, and send shipping updates   to customers. For customers, having ""conversations"" with these   bots would feel more natural than scrolling and clicking through   a mobile app. Companies could  also cut costs by reducing   the number of human customer service representatives.Facebook tethers those bots to Messenger for Business, which   provides a live customer service chat channel for a large number   of businesses. Businesses can choose to put a human or a chatbot   to handle queries on their end. This idea attracted a lot of   early adopters -- 30,000 Facebook bots were already active on   Messenger as of last September.But just as Google struggled with low-quality apps over the   years, Facebook's ecosystem quickly became bogged down with   poorly produced chatbots. Badly made bots could annoy customers   and tarnish a company's image -- so the company decided it's a   better idea to send the bots back to the drawing board than   expand the overall ecosystem.Facebook should've seen this comingThe limitations of AI-powered bots were already clear when   Facebook launched its chatbot APIs last year. For example,Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) launched its chatbot Tay onTwitteras an experimentlast March. Within 24 hours, Tay started tweeting racist and   sexist comments, forcing Microsoft to abruptly pull the plug and   issue an  apology. Tencent has also struggled to  purge   spam and scam bots on WeChat since it started letting millions of   accounts create their own bots.Facebook's AI tech also wasn't that impressive prior to the   arrival of its chatbots. Its News Feed struggled to discern fake   news headlines from real ones, and its Messenger-based virtual   assistant M hasn't gained much  ground against Google Now or   Siri.Edison Investment analyst Richard Windsor -- who    recently called Facebook a ""laggard in AI"" compared to   Google -- stated that ""when Facebook tries to automate its   systems, things always go wrong."" He also pointed out that while   Facebook has hired plenty of AI talent, it simply hasn't been   working on AI ""for nearly long enough"" to challenge market   leaders like Google.So what's next for Facebook's AI efforts?Despite those missteps, Facebook probably won't stop investing   in chatbots anytime soon. The company is expected to introduce   new AI plans at its F8 conference in April, which will likely   include ways to boost the quality, not quantity, of its Messenger   bots. It could also introduce more ways to tether bots into other   Messenger features -- like payments and games -- to increase the   app's appeal as a stand-alone platform.10 stocks we like better than FacebookWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Alphabet Suing Uber Over Self-Driving Car Technology;2/28/2017;"Uber badly needed self-driving car technology because it was in danger of getting pushed out of the market if many cheaper ride-hailing services using self-driving technology (no human driver) were to enter the market. So it assumed a not-so-honest way of getting it. That's what AlphabetGOOGLis claiming after discovering the theft of its technology by a former Googler.The Technology in QuestionGoogle has for long held that its technology, which includes hardware and software components, is superior to others. The company, which originally used LiDAR based systems from Velodyne, later developed a number of such systems for close-range, mid-range and long-range ""vision"" of self-driving cars. These systems generate millions of laser images per second that offer a much clearer picture of the area surrounding the car and helps it take more accurate decisions.Additionally, the company recently announced that it had devised a more economical system that would take its cost from $75,000, to $7,500, thus making it commercially viable.The AccusedAnthony Levandowskihas been accused of downloading 14,000 highly confidential files (9.7GB of data), including Waymo's LiDAR circuit board designs to an external disk drive using specialized software. He then downloaded a new OS to his company-supplied laptop that effectively deleted information, in a rather elaborate attempt to erase his activity. Strangely, Levandowski didn't use the laptop much after the new OS was installed.After quitting Google, Levandowski set up a self-driving trucking company calledOtto, wooing fifteen other Waymo engineers, who brought additional supplier lists, manufacturing details and other trade secrets.Otto quickly sold itself toUberfor $680 million.Uber's ResponseUber remains partners with Google for other technology despite their increased competition on the self-driving front. As an initial response, a Uber representative said, ""We take the allegations made against Otto and Uber employees seriously and we will review this matter carefully.""Later, this changed to: ""We are incredibly proud of the progress that our team has made… We have reviewed Waymo's claims and determined them to be a baseless attempt to slow down a competitor and we look forward to vigorously defending against them in court. In the meantime, we will continue our hard work to bring self-driving benefits to the world.""Other DetailsThe discovery of theft was intriguing: A Uber supplier had inadvertently copied a Google executive in a mail titled ""Otto files."" The mail was being sent to people at Uber that Google thinks were involved with Uber's self-driving technology.Google found that the replicated technology, the diagrams of which were attached to the email, bore a close resemblance to its proprietary technology and was based on Waymo trade secrets. ""Moreover, the Replicated Board is specifically designed to be used in conjunction with many other Waymo trade secrets and in the context of overall LiDAR systems covered by Waymo patents,"" the complaint reads.Upon inquiry with the Nevada Governor's Office of Economic Development and Department of Motor Vehicles, it was found that Uber said its technology was internally developed.The Big PictureAs a Bloomberg report points out, Levandowski didn't start out at Google. He has been working on autonomous vehicles for some time, founding a startup called 510 systems in 2001 that he later sold to Google. The technology this startup brought is the foundation of Google's technology.At the end of the day, engineers do like to move around because it's more profitable and allows them liberties that aren't available for sticking around at a big corporate house like Google. This is neither the first nor last time companies have whisked away people from competitors. All the major tech companies including Google itself, MicrosoftMSFT, FacebookFB, TwitterTWTR, AppleAAPL, you name it, have done likewise.Engineers are the life blood of companies like Google while on the other hand, the big companies are the only ones that can make engineers rich. So while Google could win this battle, the war will go on.A Full-Blown Technological Breakthrough in the   MakingZacks' Aggressive Growth Strategist Brian Bolan explores autonomous cars in our latest Special Report, Driverless Cars: Your Roadmap to Mega-Profits Today.

Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) a Whale of a Trade? Go Long Buffett!;2/28/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) is in the middle of a breakout. While it was a surprise to many, we profited from seeing it coming. Just recently, I wrote several strategies to go long AAPL stock, and they have all paid well and without trouble.makeArticleAd();Source:Beni Krausz via UnsplashTwelve days ago, I wrote about how you canprofit from owning AAPL or trading it. This was in addition to last month's $5 profit per contract out of thin air trading Apple stock when ithad appeared to be too late.Today, I want to repeat the success I've had trading AAPL stock long. But this time I am doing it in a smaller account, so I will use credit put spreads instead of selling naked puts.How to Trade AAPL StockThe Bet:Sell the AAPL Oct $110/$105 credit put spread. This is a bullish trade for which I collect 55 cents per contract to open. The 20% buffer from current price gives me a 90% theoretical chance of success. If Apple shares stay above $110 per share, the trade will yield 12% on money risk.The 10 Best Stock Charts on Wall Street Right NowUsually I like to balance my trades by selling opposite bearish risk, but in this case I will refrain. I will count on the Warren Buffett effect that long-term AAPL is a hold. Buyers should step in on down weeks and defend the stock for me.I could sell credit call spreads in thePowerShares QQQ Trust, Series 1 (ETF)(NASDAQ:QQQ) to create some balance, but I don't feel it's necessary at this time.Earlier, I noted that I like selling naked puts in sure things like AAPL andAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL).So I will offer the trade, but I only do this if I am willing and able to own the stock at the strike sold.The Alternate:Sell the AAPL Oct $105 put naked. This is a bullish trade for which I collect $1.25 per contract to open. My breakeven point is $103.75 per share. Anything lower would accrue losses for me.If AAPL stock falls below my sold strike, I would be put the stock at that price even if it's much lower. Therein lies the open-ended risk unlike that of a credit put spread.I am not required to hold trades through expiration. I can close either of them for partial gains or losses at any time.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director ofSellSpreads.com.

Alphabet’s Waymo Leads the Field in Driverless Cars;2/28/2017;"Image Source: WaymoAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) has been crushing its rivals in   self-driving cars, according to the latest data from the   California Department of Motor Vehicles. Alphabet's driverless   car division -- Waymo -- reported the lowest disengagement rate   among all the companies testing self-driving cars on California   roads last year, meaning there were fewer times when the   autonomous driving system had to be shut down.makeArticleAd();How things lookThe California DMV defines disengagement as either a failure   of autonomous technology or the requirement of human intervention   to switch off the autonomous mode. A lower disengagement rate   indicates that Waymo's driverless cars have become better at   driving themselves.In fact, according to this data, Waymo is not just better than   the rest; it is beating its rivals by a huge margin as its cars   had a meager disengagement rate of 0.20 per 1,000 autonomous   miles. This is down from the 0.80 disengagement rate in 2015.   This seems even more impressive in light of the fact that Waymo   vehicles covered longer distances than rivals and, asTechcnrunchreports, Waymo's autonomous vehicles and their engineers are set   to err on the side of caution when deciding to disengage.ManufacturerAutonomous miles driven in 2016DisengagementsDisengagement per 1,000 milesBMW63811.6Waymo635,8681240.2Ford59035.1Nissan4,099286.8Mercedes-Benz673183271.9Tesla550183332.7Data Source: California DMVA low disengagement rate and more miles driven indicate that   Alphabet's moonshot self-driving technology is the most   successful on California roads. More importantly, the lower   disengagement rate has been accomplished mostly in suburban and   city driving conditions. Waymo, therefore, seems to be closer   than any other company to launching its self-driving project   commercially.This is not surprising as Alphabet (then Google) began working   on driverless cars in 2009 and has the first-mover advantage.   Since then, its autonomous cars have driven over 2 million miles,   with most of the driving taking place on city streets.   Additionally, Waymo clocked 1 billion miles on the simulator last   year.The amount of time and effort put in by Alphabet's Waymo into   the self-driving car project has placed it way ahead of the curve   in autonomous driving. This might eventually turn Waymo's   driverless rivals into potential clients if they are unable to   replicate the success of its driverless tech.Waymo's rivals could start using its     technologyWaymo calls itself a self-driving technology company, not a   car company. It currently uses a Lexus vehicle and a prototype of   its own to test its driverless technology, while it is also plans   to add 100 Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid minivans to the fleet.Image Source: WaymoIt is less likely that Alphabet will manufacture cars of its   own as it seems to have charted out a different go-to-market   strategy. In January, Waymo announced that it will start   manufacturing sensors used in driverless cars in-house to   integrate its hardware and software development. This integration   should give Waymo a cost advantage and lead to stronger adoption   of its driverless technology.In fact, Waymo has reduced the cost to build a Lidar sensor --   the most crucial part of a driverless car as it uses lasers to   generate maps of the car's surroundings -- by 90%. The price of a   Lidar sensor was $75,000 in 2009, but it costs just $7,500 now.   The integration of hardware and software under a single roof will   allow Waymo to deliver seamless self-driving performance to   potential customers as it is developing its sensors in   association with machine learning experts.As automakers can get turnkey self-driving solutions under a   single roof, they will start turning to Waymo to power their   self-driving cars.Fiat Chrysler Automobiles(NYSE: FCAU) is the first such example.In May last year, Fiat Chrysler and Alphabet's Waymo struck a   deal to develop 100 self-driving cars based on the Pacifica   Hybrid minivan. This was Waymo's first deal with an automaker to   supply its driverless technology. Last month, it was reported   that both companies are going to double down on their efforts as   Alphabet could add another 100 Pacifica Hybrid minivans to the   Waymo fleet this year.ABloombergreport says Alphabet is in talks with Fiat Chrysler to start a   ride-sharing service with the minivans. If that's true, it would   indicate that Waymo is finally taking steps to monetize its   driverless technology.Honda(NYSE: HMC) , meanwhile, could be Waymo's next partner.Both companies were in negotiations last December to put   Waymo's technology into Honda's vehicles. A partnership could   alter Honda's approach to developing its own driverless cars. The   Japanese automaker initially wanted to get its self-driving cars   onto highways by 2020, but Waymo could help it go a few steps   further by adding city and suburban driving capabilities. A Honda   press release says:Honda previously announced its intention to put production     vehicles with automated driving capabilities on highways     sometime around 2020 related to its goal of a collision-free     society. In addition to these on-going efforts, this technical     collaboration with Waymo could allow Honda R&D to explore a     different technological approach to bring fully self-driving     technology to market. These discussions are an initial step     that will allow Waymo and Honda R&D to further explore the     potential of a broad range of automated driving     technologies.The takeawayThe latest California data clearly indicate that Alphabet's   Waymo has a far better driverless technology than any of its   rivals. Waymo is using this to its advantage by partnering with   automakers and showing them the strengths of its self-driving   technology. This strategy of advertising its superiority in this   space is a smart one as it can help Waymo win over potential   clients, making it a key player in the driverless car supply   chain.10 stocks we like better than Alphabet (A       shares)When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock       tip, it can pay to listen.

The Next Big Thing for Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN): Productivity Software;2/27/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) has taken on some unexpected targets lately. None more ambitious - and unforeseen - than sticking its Alexa personal assistant in the Amazon Echo smart speaker.makeArticleAd();Source: AmazonThat move has paid off with a big lead in the race to become the hub of the smart home, despite AMZN's complete lack of smartphone presence.Per a report inThe Information, Amazon is readying another bold move. If sources are correct, AMZN is preparing to take onMicrosoft Corporation's(NASDAQ:MSFT) Microsoft Office andAlphabet Inc.'s(NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google G Suite with its own cloud-based productivity suite.Report: Amazon.com Is Working on a Productivity SuiteThe Informationbroke the news that Amazon.com isworking on its own productivity suiteto take on Microsoft and Google. The website says AMZN's Amazon Web Services - AWS - unit has told some of its ""large corporate customers"" of its plans to offer a new suite of productivity apps that will compete against the two dominant players.7 REITs That Should Be CondemnedMicrosoft Office has always been considered a cash cow for the company. The productivity suite quickly became the industry standard, the applications of choice for enterprise, schools and home PC users. To make its software seem more affordable, to break free of the boom bust cycle between major versions of Microsoft Office, and to address the growing threat of Google's free Google Apps suite, five years ago, the company began pushing Office 365.This subscription version of Microsoft Office brought recurring monthly revenue and other advantages. Microsoft expanded into Office apps for mobile devices likeApple Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AAPL) iPad and began to sell online storage for Office 365 users, with OneDrive.Google Apps/G SuiteGoogle wasn't sitting still, though, refining Google Apps intoG Suite, a full-on competitor to Office 365, with paid monthly subscription plans and online storage options. The company has also leveraged Google Apps and its lightweight Chrome OS into Chromebooks - ultra-low-cost laptops that have been giving Microsoft fits, especially in the education market.That education market is where the potential for disruption is really playing out. With its free Google Apps and low-cost Chromebooks, Google upended the education market. By the end of 2015,more than half of all device in U.S. classrooms were Chromebooks. This has repercussions beyond the classroom, as those students turn into young professionals who are more comfortable with Google's productivity software than with Microsoft Office.I've seen the effect first hand. My kids do everything at school using G Suite, despite Microsoft offering free Office 365 subscriptions to students and computer labs full of Windows PCs. They ignore Microsoft Office and Apple's Pages/Numbers on our home computers, and instead log onto G Suite for doing homework.If Google could quickly make waves in one of Microsoft's key strongholds, why couldn't Amazon.com march in and disrupt both companies?Why Amazon Would Take On Microsoft OfficeThis is a key question. Taking on the Google and Apple in the smart home with the Amazon Echo made sense because the smart speaker was a Trojan horse. It offers a growing number of ""Skills"" that let it control other smart devices by voice command, or interact with online services.That ropes consumers into buying it. But Alexa is a voice-activated path to effortlessly order products directly from Amazon.com, and gives an incentive to buy other Amazon products and services like Amazon Music Unlimited and Amazon Fire TV.Where's the win for AMZN in offering productivity software, other than to tweak Microsoft and Google?For the answer, look to AWS. Amazon Web Servicesdominates the market for cloud infrastructureand the profit from this division is a big driver of Amazon's overall growth. Amazon already has the servers in place and it has several of the components needed for a productivity suite, including its WorkDocs and WorkMail apps and the recently announcedAmazon Chimevideo conferencing software. Stitch these together with a few additional components and Amazon could have its Microsoft Office and Google G Suite competitor.Google charges $5 to $10 per month for G Suite, while Microsoft Office 365 has several tiered options starting at $5.99 per month.AMZN could charge a competitive rate for its new offering, adding more subscription-based revenue to its bottom line while taking advantage of its existing cloud muscle. The base monthly fee could be supplemented by charging for additional online storage for enterprise customers - something it has plenty of.Productivity software could also become another free perk of Prime membership. Prime members that start using Amazon's productivity software could put pressure on their employers to invest in a subscription, in an effect like Google's approach that sees students graduate and look to their employers to provide G Suite access.The Dow Jones Industrial Average Keeps Rising, But a Correction Is ComingAMZN isn't commenting andThe Information'ssources say all of this is still in the early stages, but the move makes sense. Amazon has been aggressively expanding beyond its role as an online retailer, AWS has the infrastructure needed to support the initiative, the company has been creeping into enterprise software with apps like WorkMail, and Google proved that the Microsoft Office behemoth isn't invulnerable. A productivity software suite from Amazon.com could well be the company's next big thing.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace3 High-Impact Tech Earnings: Tesla, Fitbit and Square3 Dow Titans Buckling Under the PressureThe postThe Next Big Thing for Amazon.com, Inc.

Mobile World Congress: Apple Inc. (AAPL) vs. Everyone Else;2/27/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMobile World Congress is the industry's largest event for smartphone launches. Everyone who's anyone is there -unless your company name isApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL).makeArticleAd();Source: BlackBerryMWC 2017 officially started today, but the big announcements took place over the weekend.And in many ways, they set the stage for the coming battle for best smartphone that will pit Apple's 10th anniversary iPhone 8 andSamsung Electronics Co Ltd's(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) comeback Galaxy S8 against everyone else.Here's what you need to know aboutMWC 2017.Cutting Edge New SmartphonesMobile World Congress is the venue where many manufacturers choose to launch their new smartphones. That means the trends are set for what to expect in the coming year. At MWC 2017, there have been a few standouts that lead to some interesting conclusions.LG's new G6 smartphoneis one of the most talked about releases. The company abandoned the modular design it introduced in last year's G5. The new G6 incorporates design elements expected in the iPhone 8, with a glass front and back held together with a stainless-steel band.7 Best Stocks to Buy for a Donald Trump Green LightWhile bezels are still there, they're been minimized by moving the power button and fingerprint sensor to the back. The result is a 5.7-inch display in a compact body - and the display is wowing with its 564 ppi pixel density and support for HDR. The LG G6 also has a dual lens 13 megapixel camera, but unlike the iPhone 7 Plus, the extra lens is wide angle rather than telephone.Another interesting flagship release is theP10from China'sHuawei. This new premium smartphone includesLeica-branded cameras and a Portrait Mode to compete with iPhone 7 Plus feature. In addition, the P10 uses Huawei's own processor, the Kirin 960. This is bad news forQualcomm,Inc.(NASDAQ:QCOM), which is seeing more smartphone makers follow the lead of Apple by ditching the Snapdragon to develop their own customized chips.When the iPhone 8 arrives in the fall, its expected all-glass design isn't going to be as unique as Apple might have hoped. Cameras are going to be a big battleground, too, putting pressure on Apple to go further than it did with the dual-lens iPhone 7 Plus.No Galaxy S8 at MWC 2017Samsung traditionally unveils its new Galaxy S smartphones at Mobile World Congress. Not this year. Delayed by the Galaxy Note 7 battery investigation, Samsung is expected tounveil the Galaxy S8at an event on March 29.The company did take the wraps offtwo new tablets, though. The Galaxy Tab S3 and Galaxy Book. The latter is offered in two different sizes, runs Windows 10, comes with a snap-on keyboard case and stylus and is aimed atMicrosoft Corporation's(NASDAQ:MSFT) Surface Pro.Google Assistant Coming to Android Nougat and Marshmallow DevicesAlphabet Inc.(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) has had a big decision to make since introducing Google Assistant. The company broke with tradition to make its new AI-powered digital assistant exclusive to its own Google Pixel smartphones. But that restriction means the number of phones running Google Assistant are outnumbered by Siri-powered Apple devices andAmazon.com,Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AMZN) Alexa-powered smart speakers.Google chose MWC 2017 to announce it's decided to go back to the strategy of volume over exclusivity.Google Assistant will start rolling outto devices running Android Nougat and Marshmallow starting this week.BlackBerry and Nokia Makes a Splash at MWC 2017If you'd asked anyone a few months ago what companies would be generating buzz at MWC 2017, it's doubtful thatBlackBerry Ltd(NASDAQ:BBRY) orNokia Corp (ADR)(NYSE:NOK) would be anywhere on that list. But they both pulled it off. Sort of.BlackBerry's last hurrah in smartphones is the newBlackBerry KeyOne. The last phone with the company's name on it that was designed in-house combines Android with a classic BlackBerry keyboard. There's grumbling about the $549 price, but a general feeling that had BBRY releasedthisphone a few years ago, it might still be relevant in the smartphone space.The other big surprise was the return of the Nokia brand. Finland'sHMD Globalbought the rights to use the Nokia name on phones, and at MWC 2017 it announcedthree new Nokia Android smartphonesaimed at the Chinese market.The company is also bringing back the classic Nokia 3310 cell phone. Considered to be virtually indestructible, the Nokia 3310 was first released in 2000 andsold over 126 million units. The new version is a little less sturdy, but has new colors, and updated display and runs just over $50.Nokia gets some licensing revenue out of this, but was not involved in the development of the new phones bearing its brand.Everyone Against the iPhone 8The announcements from MWC 2017 largely set the stage for the coming battle for smartphone supremacy. Samsung still must take the wraps off the Galaxy S8, but after that happens, we'll largely know what Apple's iPhone 8 will be up against.Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA) Will Try to Dominate IndiaIt looks like Apple's 10th anniversary iPhone will face a strong field with large displays, impressive cameras, Google Assistant on board and new designs - at least some of which follow the direction Apple is expected to take.Who will have the best smartphone of 2017? With the big Mobile World Congress reveals over with, the ball is now in Samsung and Apple's court.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace7 Heavy-Hitting Small-Caps That Will Wallop the Market7 REITs That Should Be CondemnedThe postMobile World Congress: Apple Inc.

Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA) Will Try to Dominate India;2/27/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhile China's e-commerce market is still growing,Alibaba Group Holding Ltd(NYSE:BABA) and its affiliate Ant Financial are already looking south to India. Last year, Morgan Stanley predicted that theIndian e-commerce marketwould grow the fastest globally, to $119 billion by 2020. And Alibaba stock is poised to benefit.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockWhat's driving e-commerce and fintech in India? India passed the U.S. as the world's No. 2 smartphone market last year, with 220 million users . T he number of smartphone users in India is expected to balloon to 810 million by 2021 and India's 3G and 4G networks could cover 300 million subscribers by March 2018.India's young and growing population is increasingly tech-savvy, especially millennials.India's government also supports a cashless economy, seeing this as a way to reduce corruption and tax evasion. The Indian government alsoremoved the largest banknotes, 500 rupee and 1000 rupee notes, from the economy. This led to an explosion in the use ofmobile wallets in India, adding as many as  1 million users added per day .Last year, the National Payments Corporation of India announced theUnified Payment Interface, making it convenient for Indians to access their bank accounts on their phones and pay.And all these moving parts flow into the bull case for Alibaba stock.Taking Ant's Strategy to IndiaAlibaba and Ant (formerly Alipay) invested inOne97Communications, the parent company of Indian e-commerce player Paytm. They are expected to increase their stake to 50% from 42%. Paytm last year spun off its payments business to comply with regulations. One97 holds a 49% stake in Paytm Payments Bank and Paytm founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma owns 51%.Paytm boasted177 million usersat the end of the year and CFO Madhur Deora has set a medium-term target of 500 million users . That growth would be a boost for Alibaba stock and Ant Financial which seeks2 billion users worldwideover the next decade.7 Best Stocks to Buy for a Donald Trump Green LightPaytm is clearly taking a page out of Alibaba and Ant Financial's playbook. Like BABA'sMyBank-  the bank ""for the little guy"" - Paytm's bank promises to be a vehicle for financial inclusion, bringing services to India's unbanked.Like Ant, Paytm also wants to offer loans andasset management servicesto those who can't access them now.Ant Fortune, a wealth management app, debuted in 2015. Its users can put money in Yuebao, a money market fund, and invest inZhao Cai Bao, where they can loan money directly to businesses.Paytm's Threat to BanksBanks in both countries are threatened by this disruption. Ant's Yuebao offers depositors higher interest rates than banks andinstant withdrawals. Technology companies don't have to maintain as many employees at branches as banks do, and can link borrowers and savers directly. Their asset-light model is simply more efficient than that of existing banks, which have to use their own capital, and are burdened by legacy systems and regulation.Banks earn a profit on the spread, the difference between the rate at which they lend and the rates they offer depositors. Platforms that connect borrowers and lenders and cut out the middleman can exert pressure on this. And because Paytm and Ant Financial are branchless, they have lower overhead costs, and can offer lower fees than banks.Paytm will be both a friend and a potential enemy to banks. It will help them drum up business by cross-selling their services to its users. But Paytm will probably be the front-end in customer interactions and relegate the banks to the back end .Banks risk becoming ""dumb pipes."" As I mentioned inmy articlelast year, the front-end generally gives banks a higher return on equity than the back. AMcKinsey & Companystudy found that banks earn a 22% return on equity from sales and origination, but only 6% from the extension of credit.Protectionism RisksAll of this doesn't mean that the success of Alibaba, Ant and Paytm is guaranteed. Some risks still stand in the way.First, protectionist sentiment is rising in India asAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) andUberclobber their Indian rivals. Indian startups such as Flipkart, Snapdeal (in which BABA is an investor), and Ola have had their valuations repeatedly marked down over the past year. Now some are asking for protection against supposedly unfair foreign competition. Indian venture capitalist Vani Kola of Kalaari Capital called for such measures, followed bysimilar sentimentfrom the founders of e-commerce player Flipkart and Ola, viewed as India's home-grown Uber) .Since Paytm is an Indian company, why would this be a concern? While Paytm is Indian, its largest shareholders are Chinese, Alibaba and Ant. Would India want such a company controlling something as critical as its payments infrastructure? Experts have raised concerns overPaytm user dataending up in servers outside of India.Pointing to Paytm's Chinese ties, the chief minister of West Bengal, Mamata Banerjee accused the prime minister ofcompromising national security. The Sino-Indian relationship is contentious; the two countries went to war as recently as 1962 over a border dispute.Valeant Pharmaceuticals Intl Inc (VRX) Q4 Earnings: What to ExpectFor Paytm to work, users must see it as secure and reliable. Without trust, Paytm cannot succeed. However, in December the Paytm server was down for an hour, leaving users unable to make payments.Paytm's customer service also is a weak spot, with many rating it as bad. Also, the recent user increase may be temporary. After March 13, Paytm may lose as much as 30% of its offline customers once cash withdrawal limits end.Bottom Line on Alibaba StockEven if Paytm and BABA succeed, however, buying Alibaba stock is notwithout risks.Alibaba is a variable interest entity, which means American shareholders own shares in a Cayman Islands-based entity. Chinese law forbids foreign ownership in Chinese internet companies like Alibaba, so this structure is a way around it.But the Chinese government's position isn't clear, and it could always change its mind, at the expense of BABA stock holders.As of writing, Lucas Hahn did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace3 Stocks to Watch on Monday: Tesla Inc (TSLA), Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) and BlackBerry Ltd (BBRY)Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT) Stock Could Be a 2017 Surprise7 REITs That Should Be CondemnedThe postAlibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA) Will Try to Dominate Indiaappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Stocks recently featured in the blog includeAlphabet Inc.(NASDAQ:GOOGL-Free Report),Ford(NYSE:F-Free Report),Toyota(NYSE:TM-Free Report) andGeneral Motors(NYSE:GM-Free Report).Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations.Get #1Stock of the Day pick for free.Here are highlights from Friday's Analyst Blog:GOOGL's Waymo Accuses Uber of Stealing Confidential     FilesAlphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOGL-Free Report) Waymo has sued Uber and its subsidiary Otto, alleging intellectual property theft and patent violation.In a lawsuit filed Thursday in San Francisco federal court, Waymo accused that former manager at Google's self-driving car project, Anthony Levandowski, had downloaded over 14,000 highly confidential and proprietary files before leaving to work at his newly formed self-driving truck company Otto.Waymo claimed that Levandowski downloaded 9.7 GB of confidential files and trade secrets consisting of design files, blue prints and test documentation from a Google-issued laptop to an external drive and formatted the laptop to delete forensic fingerprints.Waymo also alleged other Google employees who joined Otto to have stolen trade secrets. The company claims that without those stolen stuff, Otto's technology, which forms an important part of Uber's efforts to roll out autonomous vehicles for its ride sharing service, wouldn't have evolved.Stemmed from an Accidental CC-ingA supplier had mistakenly included a Waymo employee on an e-mail chain that was supposed to be delivered to the Uber team. The attached ""OTTO FILES"" comprised a drawing of a self-driving car Light Detection And Ranging (LIDAR) circuit board quite similar to the one Waymo has been developing secretly.Waymo's lawsuit states that ""The sudden resignations from Waymo, Otto's quick public launch with Mr. Lewandowski at the helm, and Uber's near-immediate acquisition of Otto for more than half a billion dollars all caused Waymo grave concern regarding the possible misuse of its intellectual property.""Reigniting the ConflictThe two camps once lived in harmony. Alphabet executive David Drummond joined Uber's board in 2013 when Alphabet's venture capital arm GV, then Google Ventures, invested $258 million in the company and planned to include Uber rides in the Google Maps app.However, things started to go wrong when Uber decided to develop its own mapping and driverless car technology. The company has opened a technology center in Pittsburgh and hired some robotics specialists from Carnegie Mellon University. It also collaborated with automakers such as Volvo and acquired Otto.Google on the other hand launched a pilot project that enables carpooling in San Francisco Bay Area. Available through Google-owned maps app, Waze, the service is presently under beta testing with a handful of Bay Area companies including Adobe and Google itself. Drummond stepped down from Uber's board last year.The lawsuit certainly complicates the ongoing clash between two of the early leaders in the autonomous vehicle space. Well established car companies like Ford (NYSE:F-Free Report), Toyota (NYSE:TM-Free Report) and General Motors (NYSE:GM-Free Report) on the other hand have just started to make their way into this market.Currently, Alphabet shares carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Under Armour Inc (UA) Stock Offers the Easiest Profits Ever;2/27/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsLost in the collapse ofUnder Armour Inc(NYSE:UA) stock over the past year is an odd divergence between two classes of stock. Shares of UAA stock (Class A) have traded at a substantial premium to UA stock (Class C). The difference is about 10% at the moment, in fact.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockThat gap makes little sense. Class C UA stock has no voting rights. Class A UAA stock does have voting rights of one vote per share. But those rights don't have much value. CEO and founder Kevin Plank owns all of the non-trading Class B shares, which have 10 votes each, giving Plank 65% of the voting power as of December 2016.UAA shareholders are paying a premium for votes which are largely symbolic. And it's not as if other considerations justify that gap. The market is figuring out the divergence, as the 10% premium has narrowed of late. But there's still time for easy profits in shorting UAA and going long UA.As for investors bullish on Under Armour, there's basically no reason to pay up for the UAA stock.No, UAA Stock Isn't Worth More Than UA StockAs seen in the chart below, the gap between UA and UAA has narrowed of late, after peaking in November.7 Best Stocks to Buy for a Donald Trump Green LightAt one point in late November - less than a year after the Class C UA stock was issued - the gap was over 20%, a huge number. In dollars, the difference has dropped to near $2 per share from as high as $7 - but some of that compression has come from the fact that Under Armour stock has declined precipitously after two disappointing earnings reports.With the largely symbolic voting rights not likely to change anytime soon, there's simply very little reason for UA to trade above UAA.According to theregistration statementfiled by Under Armour with the SEC, Class C holders of Under Armour stock are entitled to the same dividends. The only way for Class A shareholders to gain some sort of majority voting power would be for Plank to be terminated for cause or to give up his shares.Neither outcome seems particularly likely given that the CEO is 42 years old, intensely competitive, and intent on turning around his beloved Under Armour himself.Liquidity doesn't justify the different prices for Under Armour stock, either, with one possible exception.There was a notable divergence in equity volume a few months ago. UA stock had an average volume under 1 million shares per day in October, roughly 20% of UAA stock. But volume over the past month is almost equal: 6.5 million shares a day for UA and 6.9 million for UAA. The increase in UA volume probably has something to do with the narrowing premium and implies that the spread will continue to tighten.How To Play Under Armour StockThere is one notable difference between UA and UAA: options volume. For instance, open interest in the UA Jan 2018 $20 puts is just over 400. In contrast, there are more than 11,000 UAA Jan 2018 $20 calls open at the moment.That difference is not enough to justify a 10% premium, however, particularly for smaller investors. And it seems the market is figuring that out. But the gap remains wide enough that there's still room to make what should be close to risk-free profits by going long UA and short UAA.Nvidia Corporation (NVDA): Amazing Company, Not-So-Good Stock ... For NowAny major event - like an acquisition, as unlikely as that seems at the moment - will treat shareholders equally. Any dividend payments will be the same. The only difference between UA and UAA is the opportunity to vote even though those votes have no practical impact.So an arbitrage trade still looks like it has some upside. Voting rights between classes at other stocks usually are below 5%, meaning a long UA/short UAA trade could make another $1 per share with very low risk.For investors who still think Under Armour stock is a better opportunity, then Class C UA stock is the right choice. The premium for UAA stock simply doesn't make a lot of sense - and it's still wide enough to profit from.The author is long UA and short UAA.More From InvestorPlace3 Stocks to Watch on Monday: Tesla Inc (TSLA), Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) and BlackBerry Ltd (BBRY)Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT) Stock Could Be a 2017 SurpriseThe 10 Best Stocks to Buy for 2017: The Experts' PicksThe postUnder Armour Inc (UA) Stock Offers the Easiest Profits Everappeared first onInvestorPlace."

3 Stocks to Watch on Monday: Tesla Inc (TSLA), Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) and BlackBerry Ltd (BBRY);2/27/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe U.S. stock market enters Monday's trading with major indices at all-time highs, and naturally, many individual stocks in the same position. However, experts are increasingly warning about overvalued issues and market bubbles - a theme that likely won't fade this week.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');A number of tech stocks have stolen the spotlight heading into Monday's trade.Alphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL) andBlackBerry Ltd(NASDAQ:BBRY) made waves over the weekend, whileTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) was getting batted around after a Monday morning headline.Here's what you need to know going into today's trade:Tesla Inc (TSLA)TSLA stock is down Monday after the company's shares were knocked down a peg by the analyst community.Goldman Sachs downgraded Tesla shares on Monday morning, dragging the company down from ""Neutral"" to ""Sell.""7 Best Stocks to Buy for a Donald Trump Green LightAnalyst David Tamberrino says:""While we believe Tesla currently has a lead relative to OEM peers with respect to vehicle technology adoption, electric vehicle architecture, and (potentially) battery scale, our concerns are more near-term oriented with respect to operational execution on the Model 3 launch, an unproven solar business, and cash needs. Ultimately we see a delayed launch (pushing volume growth out and to the right) and FCF burn rate (necessitating a capital raise before 4Q17) to weigh on TSLA's shares.""Tamberrino also worries that the SolarCity acquisition ""increased the risk profile of Tesla amidst a business model transition,"" and lowered the price target slightly from $190 to $185.Tesla is coming off a fourth-quarter earnings report during which it was announced that CFO Jason Wheeler would be exiting in April - a surprising move that has drawn a little scrutiny from the investment community.TSLA shares are off more than 2% this morning.Alphabet Inc (GOOGL)Alphabet announced that one of its artificial intelligence productswill be availablein more of the company's products moving forward.Google Assistant will now be available in the company's tablets, smartphones, computers and smartwatches for anyone using Android 6.0 Marshmallow or higher.

Priceline (PCLN) Earnings Coming Up: What to Expect;2/27/2017;"Priceline (PCLN) will report fourth quarter fiscal 2016 financial results today after the closing bell. Investors expect the online travel booking company, which has beaten Wall Street’s earnings estimates in twelve straight quarters, to deliver another solid quarter.Despite increased competition from the likes of Expedia (EXPE) and Alphabet’s (GOOGL), Priceline continues to find ways to grow not only its bookings, but also hotel room units sold. Notably, these metrics have remained steady despite currency pressures that impacts its revenues in overseas markets. On Monday analysts will want to see the extent to which Priceline’s strong international operations can drive growth, particularly with the emergence of new competitors such as Trivago (TRVG).In the three months that ended December, Wall Street expects the Norwalk, Conn.-based company to earn $12.98 per share on revenue of $2.32 billion. This compares to the year-ago quarter when the company earned $12.63 per share on $2.47 billion in revenue. For the full year, earnings are projected to rise 11% year over year to $64.67 per share, while revenue of $10.72 billion would rise 16.2% year over year.makeArticleAd();Priceline’s total gross bookings are expected to be up anywhere from 16% to 21% or in a range of $13.9 billion to $14.5 billion. Analysts sees gross profits to rise about 18% to $2.2 billion. With better-than-expected guidance coming in last week from Trivago, which forecasts 2017 revenue to grow 45%, Priceline is certainly not alone anymore. But the “Name your own price” travel deals giant is still regarded as best-in-class in its category.On Friday Rob Sanderson, analysts at MKM Partners, said he expects Priceline meet or beat the high end of its guidance. But Sanderson, who has a Buy rating on the stock and $1,950 price target, doesn’t expect Priceline to issue strong guidance. Sanderson noted Friday that Priceline’s guidance would be impacted by the Easter holiday that shifts between the first and second quarter. Meanwhile, because of increased competition, Priceline’s costs could rise too.In the third quarter, Priceline’s ""spend to bookings"" ratio grew to 6.03% from 5.77%, partly because it has to spend more money on marketing to bring customers to its platform. Nevertheless, PCLN stock has been on a tear, soaring 30% over the past year, including gains of 11% year to date, besting the S&P 500 index in both spans. And to the extent it can surprise analysts with better guidance, PCLN stock should travel toward’s Sanderson’s $1,950 price target, delivering additional premiums of 20% from current levels."

Nvidia Corporation (NVDA): Amazing Company, Not-So-Good Stock … For Now;2/27/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsStartups may be a source of tremendous innovation. But of course, old-line companies can too. Just look atNvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA). Launched in 1993, the company's co-founders - which included tech veterans like Jen-Hsun Huang (now the CEO), Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem - saw a great opportunity to develop graphics processing units (GPUs) for the gaming market.makeArticleAd();Source:via NvidiaWhile growth was strong, there was always skepticism. Was the market big enough?Well, of course, we know that GPUs have proven to be quite versatile, having applications in diverse areas like AI (artificial intelligence), self-driving cars, VR (virtual reality) and the Internet of Things (IoT). The main reason is that this core technology can process huge amounts of data on a cost-effective basis.And yes, Wall Street has certainly caught on to this. During the past year, NVDA stock is up a sizzling 200%-plus.But what now? Is it still a good time to buy NVDA stock? Or should investors wait for a better valuation?Breaking Down NVDA StockFirst of all, there are signs that the momentum is losing some of its steam. For the year so far, the stock is down 5% after back-to-back downgrades in the past week. This is despite the fact that the overall markets have been extremely bullish, with theNasdaqup about 8.5%.7 Best Stocks to Buy for a Donald Trump Green LightIn fact, since reaching an all-time high in early February, Nvidia stock has since fallen by 14%.Perhaps the most interesting thing has been the muted response from wall Street from the company's mostrecent earnings report. Revenues soared 55% to $2.17 billion and adjusted earnings came to $1.13 per share, up from 94 cents for the same period a year ago. Wall Street, on the other hand, was looking for $2.11 billion in revenues and earnings of 83 cents.For the most part, there was really nothing to complain about. It was, well, nearly a perfect performance.Yet NVDA stock fell by about 2.4% on the news.Then again, it seems that the good news is already baked into the valuation - and then some. Consider that the forward price-to-earnings ratio on NVDA stock is at 30X. By comparison,Facebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) trades at 20X andAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) sports a multiple of 22X. No doubt, the NVDA stock valuation makes other traditional chip operators look almost embarrassing. Keep in mind thatIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) andQualcomm, Inc.(NASDAQ:QCOM) both trade at about 12X.Interestingly enough, Wall Street analysts are getting a little antsy about the valuation for NVDA stock as well. Note that the average price target is at $113.59. This implies only a 7% gain from current levels.For example, Roth Capital Partners analyst Brian Algerdowngradedhis rating on NVDA stock from ""buy"" to ""neutral"" recently. Yes, his biggest concern is the valuation.Besides, the year-over-year comparisons on revenues and earnings will not get any easier for the company. If there is even a slight miss or sign of deceleration, it seems reasonable that there could be a sell-off. Might as well take profits after NVDA stock has provided substantial gains, right?Certainly.Another potential issue is the competition. Let's face it, rivalAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMD) has been making nice strides with its own graphics systems. As seen with the latest earnings report, the company looks poised for a growth spurt - and this may come at the expense of NVDA. Of course, investors have been buying up AMD stock, which is up around 600% during the past year.The Bull Case for Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FMCC) Stock Is Still AliveNow, this is in no way to diminish NVDIA's outstanding technology and the potential growth opportunities. Hey, just with autos, the addressable market could be at least $10 trillion (this is based on recent NVDAinvestor presentation).But for now, there probably should be caution. For the most part, NVDA stock is probably due for a cooling-off period. Yet this should be good news, since it may mean that investors who missed the first big move could get a second chance on the stock.Tom Taulli runs the InvestorPlace blogIPO Playbookand also has his own free iOS app to estimate your tax refund, which is atPathwayTax.com.Follow him on Twitter at@ttaulli.

Incredible! Here's How Many Internet Gadgets the Average Home Has;2/26/2017;"The notion that the world around us, particularly in   tech-friendly North America, is becoming more connected by the   day isn't necessarily surprising. What may raise an eyebrow or   two is just how prevalent connected internet gadgets already   are.What makes the sheer volume of the average homeowner's online   devices jaw-dropping is that by most accounts the Internet of   Things (IoT) in general, and ""smart"" homes in particular, haven't   even gone mainstream yet as most pundits expected last year. But   that's about to change, and today's average North American   consumer's penchant for online devices could prove to be just the   tip of the iceberg.You're kidding, right?It's not surprising the use of smartphones to access the   internet by North American's is skyrocketing. Five years ago   ""home roaming,"" in other words using a smartphone to get   connected, accounted for a mere 9% of fixed access traffic via a   Wi-Fi network. According to a recent study of North American   consumers, that figure has jumped to nearly 30%.makeArticleAd();But mobile phones are just a small piece of the connected   smart home. Gaming consoles are another fast-growing means of   accessing the internet. Surprisingly, few consumers actually use   consoles like theSony(NYSE: SNE) PlayStation to play games: a mere 2.5% according to   the study. However, a full 65% use their PlayStation to stream   movies and other entertainment from over-the-top (OTT) providers   includingNetflix.Laptops and PCs, while still prevalent in North American   households, now account for less than 25% of total internet   traffic. Toss in smart personal home assistants such asAmazon's(NASDAQ: AMZN) Alexa and similar solutions and the average home   in North American has over seven ""active devices in use each   day."" A mind-boggling 6% of homes use more than 15 connected   devices on a daily basis.If those figures seem a bit much, the stunning thing is   connected homes are expected to grow almost exponentially this   year, and continue to climb for years to come.Alphabet Nest unit. Image source: Nest.Ready, set, go!Last year there were an estimated 80 million smart home   devices delivered to consumers across the globe, up a whopping   64% compared to 2015. The stunning part of last year's explosive   smart home growth is it was woefully short of expectations.The problems are largely centered on providers like Amazon andAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) with its Next thermostat hub not   doing an adequate job of explaining the value proposition of   ""intelligent"" homes. As some analysts described it, this will be   the year of the smart home because providers ""will be smarter   about educating their consumers.""Consolidation of smart device manufacturers, Alphabet's $3.2   billion deal for Nest three years ago is one notable example, is   also expected to help in educating consumers as well as bring   costs down. Another factor key to even more widespread existence   of smart homes and devices is security.No more secretsA recent move byIntel(NASDAQ: INTC) to further its IoT initiatives -- a key effort on   CEO Brian Krzanich's transformation agenda -- included partnering   with tech giants includingGEandAT&Tinstalling cameras, microphones, and sensors on 3,200   street lights in San Diego, CA. The objective is to identify   activities including gunshots, monitor crowd sizes, and track   vehicle speeds.Though no San Diego citizen reportedly complained about   privacy issues, others certainly have. Which begs the question:   if the general public is concerned about smart cities invading   our privacy, imagine the unease as our homes become ""smarter"" by   the year? Maybe privacy isn't the issue some have suggested: it   certainly hasn't prevented the average North American consumer   from staying connected at home, by any and all means   possible.10 stocks we like better than Wal-MartWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a       stock tip, it can pay to listen.

3 Horrendously Bad Stock Market Predictions From Otherwise Smart People;2/26/2017;"""It's tough to make predictions, especially about the   future.""-- Yogi BerraEvery year, the stock market either advances, declines, or   stays flat. It's never clear beforehand which direction these   indexes, or the stocks that comprise them, will move; the reasons   for their price swings only make sense in retrospect.makeArticleAd();But that truth doesn't stop people from making aggressive   predictions attempting to identify the Next Big Thing or to call   a coming crash or boom. Here are a few classic examples of some   smart market watchers getting burned by their stock calls.1. McDonald's will trounce Google as an investmentWhitney   Tilsonhas used his value investing approach to produce awesome returns   for himself and his investors over the years. Yet his tendency to   bash ""expensive"" companies with high price-to-earnings ratios has   also burned the hedge fund giant -- big time.For example, back in 2004, Tilson made abold prediction. Writing for The Motley Fool at the time, he said the   soon-to-be-publicAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) (a.k.a. Google) would almost   certainly flame out as a business. ""I'd wager that odds are at   least 90% that its profit margins and growth rate will be   materially lower five years from now,"" he argued.Tilson got even more specific, saying thatMcDonald's(NYSE: MCD) would make a much better bet given its far lower   valuation. ""I believe that it is virtually certain that Google's   stock will be highly disappointing to investors foolish enough to   participate in its overhyped offering -- you can hold me to   that,"" he concluded.GOOGL Market Capdata byYCharts.So how did that prediction pan out? Since 2005, Alphabet   shares are up roughly 16 times, compared to less than a 400%   return for the fast food titan. The search engine giant produced   nearly $20 billion of net income last year, versus McDonald's   $4.5 billion. Today, Alphabet is worth almost six times   McDonald's in the eyes of the market.2. Smartphones will be a bustA deep understanding of technology isn't enough to protect you   from being surprised by major shifts in the industry. Andrew   Grove was one of the founders ofIntel, which profoundly shaped the semiconductor industry. He wasTime Magazine's Man of The Year in 1997. Yet in 1992 he made a prediction that   looks amazingly shortsighted in retrospect.Image source: Getty Images.ANew York Timesarticledescribed Grove as standing diametrically opposed to the position   taken byApple(NASDAQ: AAPL)  that smartphones, then imagined as ""personal   communicators,"" might develop into a huge business. They'd be   ""the mother of all markets,"" according to Apple's then-CEO, John   Sculley.Grove disagreed. The idea of a communicating device that   people carried around with them is ""a pipe dream driven by   greed,"" he said. Ironically, the article lists a few predictions   about the technology that proved prescient. These personal   communicators might handle emails, use GPS to map directions, and   even allow someone to ""order pizza using a combination of custom   electronic forms and wireless fax.""Today, the smartphone industry is massive, with Apple   accounting for nearly 150 million iPhone sales in the past year.   These devices helped spur over $24 billion of complementary   service-based revenue, which demonstrates that, if anything,   investors weren't being greedy enough about the potential for   smartphones to find a huge market.3. The Dow is headed to 36,000James Glassman's 1999 book titledDow 36,000hasn't aged well. In fact, Washington Post economics columnist   Neil Irwincalled it""perhaps the most spectacularly wrong investing book ever"" given   that it forecast a massive rally for stocks between 1999 and   2004.Glassman's timing couldn't have been worse. The Dow hit 14,000   the year his book published before plummeting to a 15-year low of   7,000 in 2009. A roaring rally has pushed the blue-chip index   back to new highs recently, but today it's still 42% below the   mark he believed the Dow would achieve over a decade ago.^DJIdata byYCharts.To his credit, Glassman has taken a hard look at how his   prediction could have been so far off the mark. He identified two   major factors thathe and his co-author missed: earnings growth and the attitude of investors as reflected in   the price-to-earnings multiples they are willing to pay for   stocks. Neither trend went in the direction they had   targeted.A better wayThese failed forecasts illustrate how overconfidence can prove   fatal to your portfolio while predictions about economic trends   are rarely more than a distraction from the business of   accumulating stock market returns.Bold predictions are compelling because they attract debate   and can pay big dividends if proven correct. But no one knows   which direction stocks or markets will move over the short term.   That's why investors are better off simply buying a diverse group   of solid stocks and holding on to the shares for years (or   decades) while allowing the power of compound returns to do all   of the hard work.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

GoPro Hasn't Bought Back Any Shares in 2017. Should Investors Be Happy?;2/25/2017;"In late 2015,GoPro(NASDAQ: GPRO) approved a $300 million buyback plan that lasted   for 12 months. However, the action camera maker only spent $35.6   million on buybacks before the plan expired last September.Those purchases were poorly timed, since GoPro bought back    about 1.5 million shares at an average price of $23.05 per   share -- roughly 140% higher than its price today. GoPro made    all those purchases during the fourth quarter of 2015, and   didn't buy back any more stock until the plan expired.Image source: GoPro.makeArticleAd();By doing so, GoPro has seemingly acknowledged that initiating   a buyback plan was a really bad move, and the company doesn't   seem interested in buying back any more stock for the foreseeable   future. Should investors be happy or upset about this strategic   shift?Why investors should be happyGoPro's prior buyback plan burned cash that should have been   applied to R&D or acquisitions of smaller companies, since   the company is gradually falling behind the tech curve.The Hero 5 isn't much more powerful than the Hero 4, the Karma   drone's recall practically handed the market toDJI, and GoPro still hasn't launched a stand-alone 360-degree camera   to counterSamsung's(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) Gear 360,Ricoh's Theta, and other similar cameras. GoPro's software ecosystem   also remains small, despite the introduction of new editing apps   and acloud backup service. Investing heavily in those areas would make more sense than   buying back stock.Samsung's Gear 360. Image source: Samsung.Even if GoPro wanted to repurchase stock, it can no longer do   so from its free cash flow. The company generated a negative free   cash flow of $151 million over the past 12 months, due to four   straight quarters of losses that only recently ended with areturn to profitabilitylast quarter.The lack of a new buyback plan also  indicates that CFO   Brian McGee, who replaced Jack Lazar last March, doesn't plan to   follow in his predecessor's footsteps. When Lazar unveiled the   previous buyback in 2015, some analysts saw the plan as a thinly   veiled attempt to offset GoPro's liberal use of stock-based   compensation -- which inflated its share count and diluted   existing shares. That move arguably benefited insiders much more   than investors.Why investors should be upsetHowever, launching a new buyback plan this year would give   investors a sign that the stock's downside potential is limited.   GoPro stock also isn't expensive, with an EV/Sales ratio of 0.96   and a 5-year PEG ratio of 0.7. Since a PEG ratio under 1 is   considered cheap, GoPro is undervalued relative to its earnings   growth potential --ifit can match analysts' long-term expectations.Many of GoPro's investors would likely welcome a buyback,   since the stock's only near-term catalyst is the relaunch of the   Karma, which could struggle to reach customers after missing the   crucial holiday season.A big buyback could also flush out short sellers -- who were   shorting 33% of the company's outstanding shares as of Feb. 9 --   and spark a short squeeze. That rally could inspire GoPro's   insiders, who sold more shares than they bought over the past 12   months, to  finally buy more shares. That, in turn, could   inspire institutional investors, who only hold about 38% of GoPro   shares, to finally come back.Forget about buybacks... for nowGoPro's abandonment of buybacks can be considered positive or   negative, but I believe that the company should focus more on   improving its core technologies.The company has repeatedly claimed that it has a bright future   in virtual reality, but its multi-camera Omni and Odyssey rigs   were too bulky and pricey compared to cheaper action-camera sized   solutions like the Gear 360. GoPro secured an early 360-degree   video partnership withAlphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) YouTube, but YouTube   subsequentlyopened up that platformto a wide range of other cheaper cameras.GoPro's cloud backup platform also doesn't make sense, since   it charges a $5 monthly fee for a service which Google Photos   provides for free on smartphones. Moreover, the platform doesn't   backup videos in 4K quality -- which likely disappoints hardcore   GoPro users. Lastly, GoPro must execute a smart marketing blitz   to get the Karma back on track, especially after DJI's Mavic Pro   delivered many similar features in a superior package last   year.The key takeawayBuybacks are often considered a strategy that mature companies   use after they run out of ways to significantly improve their   core businesses. GoPro is in a slump, but it hasn't reached   maturity yet since it still has plenty of ways to improve its   camera, drone, and software businesses. Therefore, I believe that   investors should be happy that GoPro didn't initiate a new   buyback plan this year.10 stocks we like better than GoProWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Tiny Company That Bought Google's Satellites Becomes a Rising Star;2/25/2017;"There's a battle going on in outer space, for control of the   Earth imaging market.Yesterday morning, we learned thatDigitalGlobe(NYSE: DGI) hassold itselfto Canadian space-tech specialistMacDonald, Dettwiler and Associatesfor a purchase price of $2.4 billion -- and not a moment too   soon. DigitalGlobe, if you recall, is the American   satellite-imaging company that itselfbought one-time Motley Fool recommendation   GeoEyea few years ago.Just before announcingits ownsale, DigitalGlobe reported a loss for its fiscal fourth quarter.   And if you ask me, this suggests the time is ripe for   DigitalGlobe to cash out -- the more so because its primary area   of business is about to get even tougher to compete in.makeArticleAd();How hi-res is a high-resolution snapshot from space? Here's     one that Planet Labs' now-acquired Terra Bella satellites     recently snapped of the U.S. Air Force's Davis-Monthan airplane     ""boneyard"" of decommissioned military aircraft. Image source:     Terra Bella.Who is DigitalGlobe?DigitalGlobe is one of the biggest names in satellite-based,   highly detailed Earth imaging. The company operates a   constellation of five satellites capable of snapping photographs   from orbit at resolutions as minute as 30 centimeters per pixel.   DigitalGlobe calls its constellation ""the best in the world"" and   ""the largest constellation in the industry,"" and that's at least   half right.Problem is, it's also half wrong. DigitalGlobe may dominate   the market for highly detailed Earth imaging. But over at upstart   Planet Labs (also known simply as ""Planet""), one of the leaders   of the ""new space"" industry is rapidly overtaking DigitalGlobe in   breadth of coverage.(Re-)Introducing Planet LabsAs we discussed last month, Planet had for some time been   discussing acquiringAlphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL)satellite imaging business, Terra Bella. The purchase price remains a mystery -- but the deal itself is   apparently now a ""go."" On Feb. 3, Planet confirmed that it will   indeed acquire Terra Bella from Alphabet, along with its fleet of   seven high-resolution (capable of sub-meter resolutions)   satellites.Then, last week, Planet announced the launch of 88 new ""Dove""   medium-resolution (three to five meters per pixel) satellites,   more than doubling the size of its medium-res constellation to   144 birds in orbit.Planet made history here in a couple of ways. First, its   deployment was part of an Indian government PSLV (Polar Satellite   Launch Vehicle) launch that sent 16 other satellites, in addition   to Planet's, into space. At 104 satellites total, the mission   that carried Planet's Doves was the largest-ever satellite   deployment made from a single rocket.More important, Planet says that its 144 Doves in orbit, plus   five RapidEye satellites acquired from BlackBridge in 2015, give   it a constellation of 149 satellites in orbit today. Feel free to   mentally add seven more to that number once the Terra Bella   acquisition is finalized, if you like. But already, Planet's   mixed bag of 149 satellites gives it ""the largest private   satellite constellation in history.""This is significant not only because it gives Planet bragging   rights. By more than doubling its satellite constellation, Planet   says it now has the ability to ""image all of Earth's landmass   every day."" Alone among satellite operators, Planet can now take   a snapshot of every square foot of Earth's solid surface once per   day, every day of the year.What it means to investorsWith every passing day, Planet Labs is getting bigger,   treading more and more on DigitalGlobe's astro-turf, and making   its rival's products nonunique. Indeed, even if the photos taken   by Planet's Doves don't offer quite the same resolution as   DigitalGlobe offers, Planet's ability to take somanysnapshots every day gives the company a more all-encompassing   view of what's happening around the globe.It's difficult to guess what advances will flow from access to   such data. Better weather forecasting, certainly. A clearer view   of the progression of global warming, its effects and its causes,   very likely. But we can also anticipate Planet generating better   data on traffic patterns on highways, at ports, and along   shipping routes; on the spread of residential development that   could guide brick-and-mortar retailers on where to place their   next big-box stores; and in countless other ways.The future is looking awfully bright for Planet Labs. And it's   getting brighter every day, one Dove at a time.Look! Up in the sky! This time it really is a bird -- in     fact, a whole lot of Planet Labs' Flock 3p Doves.

Tech Most Popular Sector for Investment Fund Managers in 2017;2/24/2017;"Data show that Silicon Valley darlings once again captured the interest of stock fund managers looking to cash in on the sector's growth and dreams in the fourth quarter of 2016.In a ranking of the 20 S&P 500 stocks that U.S. funds managing more than $1 million bought the most, tech companies took eight spots: Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL), Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Cisco (CSCO), Alphabet (GOOG) and Intel (INTC). Microsoft and Apple also saw the most buying in the S&P 500, according to data compiled by GuruFocus.The results show U.S. investment fund managers packing into a market sector that already sprinted through last year, gaining 23.5% in 2016 versus 9.54% in the S&P 500. So far, it has not broken a sweat going into 2017, rising 29.49% year to date versus 5.58% in the S&P 500. Only one sector has outperformed it, financials, which rose 44.90% year to date on the back of investor optimism in future tax cuts and interest rate hikes.makeArticleAd();Some research indicates investors can expect further growth for tech. Global information company The NPD Group forecasts 2% growth in technology industry sales in 2017 from 2016, driven by innovation, new products and low prices. A gaggle of fresh product categories is also slated to lure more buyers, like drones, virtual reality and home automation products, in addition to seasoned products like TVs and PCs in the premium space.For just one product, drones, NPD researchers anticipate 177% in sales growth from 2016 to 2018, led mainly by hobbyists. Less tech-savvy consumers may also begin to get on board with smart home devices, where NPD predicts 80% growth over the same period.Other megatrends continue down the pipeline, like cloud computing, big dada and artificial intelligence, but some market watchers see reason for worry.""Looking at the other side of these favorable long-term trends, I remain wary of certain hardware companies whose products are becoming commoditized. For example, in the personal computer market, virtual reality headsets and computers are an opportunity for growth, but so far, demand has been largely anemic,"" said one analyst, Charlie Chai of Fidelity in a sector outlook.""""The smart-device market is increasingly saturated and lacks products capable of driving sustainable new excitement. On the enterprise hardware front, there continue to be many technology disruptions, which increase the long-term risks for some incumbents. Although valuations are generally low for enterprise hardware companies, I continue to struggle with their challenging long-term outlooks.""Employment momentum has carried over into 2017, indicating companies see these opportunities expanding. The tech industry added a net 9,000 jobs in the IT sector in January, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The highest employment growth occurred in software and technology services where 12,500 jobs were added, extending growth of 73,900 jobs in 2016, despite layoffs at numerous companies.Earnings growth has supported tech's rally. Of the 408 companies that had reported earnings as of Feb. 17, tech led all sectors with a 12.1% increase year over year, amounting to an additional $68.2 billion. Eight of the 11 sectors were expected to finish the quarter with improved earnings, according to Thomson Reuters. Yet when removing sub-industries with the highest growth, semiconductor equipment and electronic manufacturing services, the growth rate declines to 11.1%, more in line with financials and utilities.The S&P North American tech sector index had a trailing price-earnings ratio of 28.07 and projected price-earnings ratio of 20.47 as of Jan. 31. It also had a price-book ratio of 4.92%, price-free cash flow ratio of 16.52 and dividend yield of 1.21%. Its largest constituents are Apple, Microsoft, Facebook and Alphabet.Microsoft, favorite of most U.S. funds, grew fourth-quarter revenue 1.23%, operating earnings 2.5% and earnings 3.62% from the prior-year quarter, on the strength of cloud and office products and services. Personal computing fell 5% primarily by a drop in gaming revenue and its feature phone business, which it sold in November. During the quarter, the company returned $6.5 billion to shareholders in share repurchases and dividends.Donald Yacktman(Trades,Portfolio)'sYacktman Fund(Trades, Portfolio)s commented on the company in its recent letter, ""Microsoft's shares were solid contributors to fourth-quarter results as the company continues its remarkable transformation under CEO Satya Nadella. Microsoft could be a significant beneficiary of the new administration's proposed tax repatriation plan.""The biggest guru investor in Microsoft is Jeff Ubben (Trades, Portfolio), who has 19.71% of his reported portfolio in the company.Apple's performance also shined in most categories, with all-time sales record for its iPhone, services, Mac and Apple Watch. Fourth-quarter revenue rose 3.19%, and EPS increased 2.44% to an all-time high. Earnings for the company struggled, though, falling 2.62% year over year, as net and gross margins declined. Apple returned $15 billion to investors in share repurchases and dividends during the quarter. CEO Tim Cook also hinted at ""products in our pipeline.""A guru Apple shareholder, David Rolfe (Trades, Portfolio), commented in his Wedgewood Partners recent letter, ""Clearly the Company does not need to spend $10-$15 billion per year to sustain the evolutionary upgrades to the iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch and/or new video streaming services. Apple's nascent automotive program Project Titan may not be at all about creating a complete autonomous driving car (Apple Car), but rather the creation of software that makes existing cars smarter - or even autonomous. Now that is a huge, creatively disruptive opportunity.""Apple's top guru shareholder is David Einhorn (Trades, Portfolio), whose Greenlight Capital has 11.56% of its assets in his reported long portfolio in the stock. Another famous shareholder, Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio), owns 1.09% of Apple's shares, which make up 4.49% of Berkshire's portfolio.

IMAX's Mediocre Results Belie Blockbuster Opportunities;2/24/2017;"For those invested inIMAX Corporation(NYSE: IMAX) , the industry leader in large screen movie   theaters, it should come as no surprise that the company's   performance follows the slate of movies for the year -- the   company lives and dies by blockbusters.In 2016, box office growth was tepid, so the company had some   tough comps going into its fourth-quarter and full year financial   report, and investors were preparing for the worst.Will IMAX's outlook improve in 2017? Image source: IMAX.makeArticleAd();Tough compsIMAX reported revenue of $106.9 million for the quarter, down   10% from $119.3 million from the prior year quarter, though it   was better than the $99.6 million analysts were expecting. Net   income of $0.27 per diluted share also exceeded expectations of   $0.21 expected by analysts. Pulling back to a wider view, the   overall annual results looked better. For the full year, IMAX   produced revenue of $377 million compared to $374 million in the   prior year.Let's face it: While 2016 was a good year at the movies, this   was never going to be easy. The slate from 2015 boasted such   cinematic heavyweights asJurassic World,Furious 7,Avengers: Age of Ultron,Minions, andStar Wars: The Force Awakens. These top five movies pulled in a combined $7.8 billion in box   office. Even though 2016 leadersCaptain America: Civil War,Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,Finding DoryandZootopia, andThe Jungle Bookwere each an unqualified success, their combined box office of   $5.2 billion was nearly $2.6 billion below the results of 2015's   all-stars. That's a lot of popcorn.Expanding network and dealsThere was, however, plenty of good news in the report for   investors willing to dig a little deeper. The company installed   166 new IMAX theaters during the year, up 22% over the prior   year. This brings the installed base of theaters to 1,215 screens   in 75 countries. The company also signed installation agreements   for a record 319 IMAX theater systems during the year and the   backlog of theaters waiting to be built now totals 498. The   majority of these new signings were joint-revenue sharing   agreements, which cost more up front, but allows IMAX to share in   future box office revenue going forward. This all indicates that   the company is well positioned to take advantage of an improved   slate of movies in 2017 and beyond.IMAX also announced that it had extended its existing   agreement withThe Walt Disney Company(NYSE: DIS) with a multi-picture deal through 2019. From the   press release:Highlights of the agreement include IMAX's involvement in     the release of Lucasfilm's untitledIndiana Jonesfilm, untitled Han SoloStar Warsanthology film,Star Wars: The Last JediandStar Wars: Episode IX,Marvel'sBlack Panther,Ant-Man and the Wasp,Captain Marvel,Avengers: Infinity Warand the untitled Avengers sequel; Disney'sBeauty and the Beast,A Wrinkle in TimeandMulan; Pixar'sThe Incredibles 2andToy Story 4and Walt Disney Animation Studios' Wreck-It Ralph sequel.IMAX has new virtual opportunites! Image source: IMAX.JUMPing on this opportunitiesAnother exciting development for the company is in the field   of virtual reality (VR). IMAX announced last year that it had   partnered withAlphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) Google to develop a cinema grade   VR camera, incorporating Google's Jump 360 camera rig. This fits   into IMAX's strategy for a location-based virtual reality   initiative, which would allow friends to participate in a group   VR experience. On the conference call, IMAX indicated that more   than 7,000 attendees had visited the pilot center, which opened   in Los Angeles on January 6th, during its first six weeks of   operation. The company believes that providing consumers with an   option to participate in VR without spending thousands of dollars   on equipment will ""kick-start"" the industry. As the result of   this successful pilot, IMAX is expanding its experiment to five   additional locations, which it expects will all be open by   mid-year.Though 2016 didn't give IMAX investors anything to cheer   about, the company has been investing in the future. IMAX has   been quietly investing in big initiatives, signing new theaters   and building out its network. Seems like its following advice   from an old movie ""if you build it, they will come"".10 stocks we like better than IMAXWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock       tip, it can pay to listen.

Buy the Kinder Morgan Inc (KMI) Stock Dip and Sit Tight;2/24/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsKinder Morgan Inc(NYSE:KMI) is one of the largest midstream energy players in the U.S. In the energy patch, there are upstream firms (exploration and production), midstream firms (pipelines and storage terminals) and downstream firms (retail, refining and distribution). Big energy companies likeExxon Mobil Corporation(NYSE:XOM) are vertically integrated across all of these sectors.makeArticleAd();Source:Roy Luck via FlickrThe midstream players have been interesting for two core reasons: Many were master limited partnerships (MLPs) that treated shareholders as owners, and distributed profits on a regular basis in the form of dividends. And those dividends were very juicy for a while.The second reason is, midstream players are more like toll booth operators. Unlike their upstream or downstream brethren, the price of whatever commodity is flowing through pipes matters little to midstream players. It's the volume that matters.3 Earnings Reports That Should Be on Your RadarWith all this in mind, we can now explore where KMI fits into the picture right now.KMI Stock TurnaroundIn late 2014, KMI announced it was going to buy up its MLPs and consolidate them into the general partner firm Kinder Morgan. This was a $76 billion internal acquisition and made KMI ""the largest midstream company and third largest energy firm in the U.S."", according to its CEO and Chairman Richard Kinder. It now operates 84,000 miles of pipelines in the US and Canada, with 155 terminals.The goal was likely to consolidate the profits into KMI and not have to distribute so much of the profits to shareholders. That was all well and good, but then the bottom fell out of the energy markets. As the merger was announced, oil was nearly $100 a barrel and natural gas was around $4 per million BTU. Now, oil and natural gas are slightly better than half those prices.Needless to say, the past couple of years have been tough on KMI in particular and the U.S. energy patch in general. But there is a turnaround under way. Rig counts in the U.S. are up, week after week. Mergers are popping in the midstream space and companies that have cash are looking to gain market share.U.S. inventories are growing and exports are booming. Shale production is getting back online. The economy is getting back on its feet. Things are looking up.And even if this increased production keeps prices low, it doesn't matter to KMI. It will be making money on the increased flow, not the prices. This is why the midstream sector is the best place to get back into the U.S. energy game, since it's about increasing demand and is slightly agnostic about supply.This Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Trade Is a Sure ThingWhile KMI doesn't throw off a huge MLP-like dividend, it does provide a 2.3% dividend that will at least pay you for your patience as the stock and the sector get back to full capacity.Richard Band'sProfitable Investingadvisory service helps retirement savers outperform the market without losing a minute of sleep along the way.

Snap IPO: Exploring the Company's S-1;2/24/2017;"Snap(NYSE: SNAP) , the social media company behind Snapchat, has   expressed interest in an IPO for months, but recently took   significant steps toward making that a reality.In this episode ofIndustry Focus: Tech, Motley Fool tech analyst Dylan Lewis and contributor Evan Niu,   CFA, wade through the company's S-1 and breakdown the business   for investors. They run through some of the big risks facing   Snap, how the company's valuation stacks up, and some key   concerns investors should have with the voting rights for the   shares they'll be able to purchase.Editor's note:This episode was recorded prior to firmer valuation figures     becoming available, so there might be some minor differences in     the numbers in our discussion.makeArticleAd();A full transcript follows the video.10 stocks we like better than FacebookWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even     better buys.Click hereto learn about these picks!*Stock Advisor returns as of February 6, 2017This podcast was recorded on Feb. 16, 2017.Dylan Lewis:Welcome toIndustry Focus, the podcast that dives into a different sector of the stock   market every day. It's Friday, Feb. 17, and we're talking tech   and exploring Snap's IPO filing. I'm your host, Dylan Lewis,   and I'm joined on Skype byfool.comsenior tech specialist Evan Niu. Evan, how's it going?Evan Niu:Pretty good, pretty good.Lewis:Are you a Snapchat user? Do you have it on your phone?Niu:I recently downloaded it just to play around with it. I've   read plenty about it, I know how it works, I know the gist of it.   But I started playing around with it, and it's really not   intuitive or easy to use. [laughs] I don't have a lot of people   on there that I follow, so I certainly don't have the full   experience of regular users. But I don't really see the appeal to   it. It seems really niche to me.Lewis:Yeah, I'll say, I am a Snapchat user. I have a lot of   friends that use it. My interest will wane depending on how often   my friends are using it, and that will bring me in or out of the   system. But, it seems to be super popular with millennials, and   given a lot of the buzz with the company and the fact that it is   a big tech company that's thinking about going public, there   are a lot of investors that are interested in it.Niu:Yeah, there's been so much hype around this thing. It   doesn't seem to me like it has a mainstream appeal, which is the   exact problem thatTwitter(NYSE:TWTR)  has run into over the past few years. I see a lot more   closer comparisons to Twitter thanFacebook(NASDAQ: FB) , which is the exact opposite storyline that Snap is   going to try to sell doing its roadshow.Lewis:Yeah. Listeners, to give you an idea of what we're going to   talk about today, give you a little overview of Snap, the   Snapchat property specifically, talk a bit about their plans to   go public, and what Evan and I noticed when we dug through the   S-1 that recently became available. So, we talked about, they are   social media company, but they call themselves a camera   company, which is interesting.Niu:I noticed this really funny coincidence -- I don't know if   you would call it a coincidence -- Snapchat used to consider   itself a storytelling company, and now it's calling itself a   camera company. Meanwhile,GoProused to call itself a camera company and now is trying to   call itself a storytelling company. So, these two companies, they   have this weird identity thing where they want to be each other,   and I don't get why, because it's not like GoPro is doing very   well. I think it's kind of a weird thing rebrand themselves as a   camera company. I mean, they have the new Spectacle glasses   with cameras, but I don't know. It's just a weird identity to   me.Lewis:Yeah. For listeners who might not be familiar with the   social media platform Snapchat, basically, you can think of it as   a messaging platform where you are, for the most part, shooting   quick, instantly deleted pictures and videos to you and your   friends. You can also post them as stories. It has gained a lot   of popularity with the millennial group. User count is still kind   of low, we can talk about that a little bit, but the company is   planning to go public, looking to raise $3 billion via the public   markets in an issuance that would value the whole company   a somewhere between $20 [billion] to $25 billion. As tech   IPOs go, this might be one of the biggest ones for 2017.Niu:Yeah, definitely. It's definitely the most exciting, the   most looked forward to. People have been waiting for this thing   for years.Lewis:Yeah, and anything that's consumer-facing is naturally   going to have a lot more buzz to it. I think there might be some   folks out there who are saying, ""Wait a minute, I thought I saw   an announcement that this company planned to IPO back in the fall   of 2016. Why are we just getting the S-1 and all the   information about the company in the past couple weeks?""   That's because Snap opted to go public via the confidential IPO   process. This process and this approach is a byproduct of the   2012 Jumpstart Our Businesses Act. Basically, under this updated   legislation, companies with under $1 billion in annual revenue   can file paperwork for an IPO confidentially with the SEC. That   allows the company to go back and forth with the regulatory   agency without alerting the public that they are planning on   IPO-ing, although Snap chose to do so anyway. Then, once the   company decides they do want to go forward with an issuance, the   filing must be made public at least three weeks prior to the IPO   roadshow beginning, which is when the underwriting investment   banks begin talking to clients and building interest in a   potential issuance. This is all to say, while the ""confidential   IPO"" name might sound kind of shady, this is something that's   totally on the up-and-up. And that is the reason why we only got   a look at the company's books and the S-1 earlier this month,   even though they announced intentions to IPO a ways back.Niu:Right. I think part of the purpose is to, like you   mentioned, avoid public scrutiny for the early drafts of the S-1.   All companies always have to file the S-1, but this way they can   refine it without all the public scrutiny, looking at it and   scrutinizing it. I think the idea is to encourage more companies   to explore the IPO process, and if companies do end up going   public, they get more capital, and it just boosts the economy in   terms of more investments happening. I think that's the goal.   But, yeah, it is a little weird when you hear ""confidential.""Lewis:Yeah, and I think it also gives companies the opportunity   to maybe think about going public and walk back without sharing   all of their business information publicly. So, you can test the   waters and see if you're ready, and you might decide you're not,   but you don't have to go through the question of your business   practices, if you think you're going to file and you have to   publicly walk back.Niu:Right, exactly.Lewis:So, that's part of it. There are some adjustments in the   regulatory requirements for how far back a company needs to   provide financial statements, as well. But really, all in all,   it's a tool that allows small-growing companies to keep some of   their core business info private and make the going-public   process a little bit easier. And that's really all there is to   the confidential IPO process. Given that the company's S-1 filing   became public earlier this month, I think it's fairly safe to   assume we're going to see Snap trading on the New York Stock   Exchange sometime in the next couple months. Evan?Niu:Yeah, seems like it's coming.Lewis:Considering that they are a social media company, I think   it makes the most sense to start looking at their user base and   what's going on there. That's kind of the lifeblood of businesses   like Facebook and Twitter, and Snap is really no different.   Within their S-1, they mention, ""We assess the health of our   business by measuring daily active users because we believe that   this metric is the most reliable way to understand engagement on   our platform."" So, it's clear that this is what they're honing it   on as a key metric, and it's what investors are going to be   watching as well.Niu:Yeah. I did find it interesting that they don't disclose   monthly active users, they only disclose daily active users,   which is right around 160 million. With social media companies, I   always tend to look at sequential growth as opposed to   year-over-year growth, because with user base, that's the nature,   there's no seasonality, it's just how much you can grow over   time. So, I look at sequential. In that respect, Snap's growth is   really decelerating -- it's grinding to a halt, almost. And the   company tries to explain this in saying, ""Oh, it's because we   haven't come out with any big new product innovation."" And, of   course, that has an impact, but you also have to worry about   competition, because Facebook has done a really good job copying   a lot of Snapchat's features, especially the Story thing, which   is now on Instagram. Facebook already has, I think, about 150   million daily active users using Stories now. And they launched   that last year, and it's an exact replica. So, you have to wonder   if that's what's taking a bite out of it. And, obviously,   Facebook is much bigger, they have more resources, they can   innovate and develop faster. It's really Mark Zuckerberg, and   Silicon Valley's -- I mean, Snapchat isn't based in Silicon   Valley, but Facebook certainly is -- and Facebook tried to buy   them, and if they can't buy them, they'll copy them, and they   compete, and that's exactly what they're doing. And they're doing   a really good job so far. So, I think there is some concern about   competition and whether or not Snap can really keep up.Lewis:Yeah. And Facebook famously made Snapchat an offer, I   believe it was somewhere around $5 billion or so, a little ways   back, and CEO Evan Spiegel said, ""No, we're going to see what we   can do with this on our own."" If they wind up going public at   this gaudy valuation, it certainly works out well for him, but   you wonder if that might have stoked the competitive fire in Mark   Zuckerberg a little bit.Niu:And he can also empathize, because he did the exact same   thing withGoogle(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) . [laughs] So many people tried to   buy Facebook, and he said, ""No, I want to do my own thing,"" and   now Facebook is enormous and he is one of the richest men in the   world. [laughs]Lewis:Yeah it's hard to blame him for that. To put some numbers   on what's going on with their user growth, like you said,   year-over-year, the numbers look really great. They're up 48%.   But sequentially, Q3 to Q4 of 2016, growth was only 3%. So, if   you look at the graph that they provided in their S-1, it does   look like growth is flattening out a little bit. Given that so   much of the expectation for these social platforms is continuing   to build user base, and being able to monetize that user base   really well, you have to worry about that as an ongoing risk for   the business.Niu:Yeah. If they are a niche product, which, it seems that way   to me, then this could be it...and, obviously, 160 million daily   users is a pretty big number. And you can build a healthy   business there if you keep your expectations modest and try to   build around that base. Whereas, if you're trying to grow, if   you're spending a ton of money trying to grow it, and you can't,   which is exactly the problem that Twitter is having, then that's   when it starts to hurt financially. But if you just accept   it for what it is and plan your business accordingly, you can   build a pretty decent business out of it.Lewis:Yeah. For some context, I went back and looked at   Facebook's S-1 to see how they stacked up when they went   public. At the time, they had 480 million daily active users, and   they were posting 48% year-over-year growth and 6% sequential   growth. You hear that and think, ""Well, those growth rates are   kind of similar, right?"" The difference was scale. Even when they   were doing single-digit sequential growth quarter-to-quarter,   they were still adding tens of millions of users, not five   million, as Snapchat did last quarter. I think that's a huge   risk, especially as you see a more entrenched competitor taking   what's working for you and has a lot of traction with users that   you already have on your platform and just applying it to this   massive user base that they have.Niu:Right. Facebook is interesting because they started   earlier, before the really big rise of mobile. So a lot of their   early days were on desktop. Then, they had to navigate the   transition to mobile, which they have done ridiculously well, far   better than I think anyone ever imagined, whereas companies like   Twitter and Snap, they came out on mobile from the beginning.   Particularly Snap -- I mean, there is no desktop Snapchat.Lewis:Right. Beyond the user base, I think a lot of people want   to know what's going on with the financials as well. In 2016, the   company booked $404 million in revenue, up from $58 million in   revenue in 2015. That is humongous growth, but that is on a very   tiny denominator. The reality with Snapchat is that they really   just kind of turned on the monetization engine there, and have   only really rolled out ads for a very short period of time. Right   now, even, it's still a pretty ad-light experience for users.Niu:Yeah. They only recently released their API to automate ad   sales, which is a hugely important part of scaling for   advertising businesses, because it allows your advertisers to do   this automatically, it's much less labor-intensive to do it. So,   they literally only did this a few months ago, and it's still in   beta. So, it's very early days in terms of their ad business.Lewis:And that's really what's going to be making up most of the   money for Snap overall, right? Advertising made up 96% of   Snap's revenue in 2016. I don't expect that to change. We talked   about how they have the Spectacles as well, and they bill   themselves as a camera company. There might be some hardware   applications somewhere down the road, but in terms of a scalable,   high-margin business, they're going to look to monetize the   Snapchat platform first, because if they can do it well, the   opportunity is the biggest there.Niu:Oh, absolutely. You can't make money on hardware. Those   glasses...you might make a little bit of money, but the whole   point of that is to get people to use the platform.Lewis:Exactly, yeah. And that just feeds into the idea of people   posting their stories and sending stuff to friends, and making   that video and picture capture a little bit easier. Looking down   at their bottom line, they ran a $500 million loss in 2016, down   even more from losses of $370 million in 2015. The company is   also free cash flow negative to the tune of $670 million. No   surprise there. It's a high-growth tech company, very rarely   are they profitable when they go public. But one thing, I don't   want to nitpick too much with costs, but one line item that   popped out to me was general and administrative expenses are $165   million, which is more than they spent in sales and marketing,   and almost as much as the company spent in R&D. And they talk   about how this is attributable to headcount increasing 200% year   over year, but from a corporate strategy perspective, it seems   like there's sinking a ton of money into G&A. I would think,   if anything, the big money suck would be on the tech side, and   gaining talent and pushing the platform in a new direction.Niu:Particularly with them talking about how important product   innovation is to driving user growth, you would think they would   invest more in that. But yeah, overall, I'm not too surprised at   their costs in terms of their operating expenses. I just don't   know what they're going to do next to try to really grow the   platform more. Why aren't they spending more money on   R&D?Lewis:Yeah. And they're going to have to. If you look at the   current valuation...we talked about how they're probably going to   end up IPOing somewhere in the $20 [billion] to $25 billion   valuation range. That would mean that they are trading at 62X   trailing sales. Not earnings, sales. That is a huge number.Niu:Yeah, it's ridiculous. I remember when Twitter and Facebook   went public a few years back. They both went probably right   around 25-26X sales. And back then, I was like, ""Wow, that's   really expensive."" [laughs] And now, 62X sales, it's unheard   of. It just speaks to the hype around this company. Of course,   the valuation is going to change, and we don't know what they're   actually going to price the IPO at. Right now, everything is   really preliminary, and they don't price the IPO until the night   before it actually goes public. And, of course, that's all a   function of how successful the roadshow is. If they can   really drum up investor interest, or conversely, if they don't,   then that's going to really drive what the IPO price is at. But   there's a possibility that this goes higher if they have a really   good roadshow, which is insane. Can you imagine them getting   closer to 70X sales? Who knows at this point -- it's not   impossible for that to happen. It's just insane that this company   would be able to command such a premium.Lewis:And I think another layer of context here: Were it to IPO   and have a valuation somewhere in the mid 20s, it would basically   be valued at twice Twitter's current valuation. According to   analysts, Snapchat has more daily active users than Twitter, but   Twitter brought in 5X as much revenue last year. So, when you   think about what a really successful ad launch would look like,   and building out the platform in a way that has non-invasive ads   that don't really detract too much from user experience, and you   start to get into that $2.5 billion annual ad revenue, and   building on that. And they would be doing that at twice the   valuation that Twitter is currently at. So, you just look at the   numbers, and it's really tough to make it work, the way it's   currently priced.Niu:Yeah. There's no way I'm touching this thing. [laughs]Lewis:Beyond valuation and some of the user growth issues, I know   that you particularly wanted to hone in on some of the stuff with   voting rights with the shares they'll actually be issuing.Niu:Yeah, I think it's really interesting. The shares that   they're issuing to the public get zero votes. Not even one, zero.   A lot of tech companies have been doing this thing for a long   time where they give the public shares one vote, and the insiders   get these supervoting shares with 10 votes or more. That allows   the company founders and insiders to maintain control no matter   what. Google is probably the biggest and earliest example of   this. Even today, collectively, all the insiders, between the   executives and directors of Google, they collectively control   about 60% of the voting power. So, public investors really have   no say. If they disagree with something, they have no   recourse. Facebook is, of course, another good example, with   Zuckerberg himself personally controlling about 60% of the voting   power. So, he wouldn't even have to ask anyone, he just does   whatever he wants. So, the question is, is it really a big deal?   Investors are now used to this idea that they don't get a say and   how these companies are run. The difference with Snap is that   they're basically being upfront and being like, ""You don't even   get to pretend like you have a say.""Certainly, it's all bad from a corporate governance   perspective on principle, because obviously, it's better for   shareholders to have a say. But at the same time, you can see   that it's worked quite well for companies like Google and   Facebook. Imagine if Google shareholders had a vote in telling   Google not to do all this random side stuff that they explore,   you could argue that the company wouldn't be as successful as it   has. There is a case to be made that this is a good thing, in   some situations. But we don't know how it's going to play out for   Snap.Lewis:Yeah. I think one of the reasons why I have a bone to pick   with it is, you have the two company co-founders, Evan Spiegel,   the CEO, and Robert Murphy, the CTO. They are the sole owners of   the supervoting Class C shares, which get 10 votes. Any Class Bs   or Cs that are sold are transferred automatically convert to the   Class As, the non-voting shares. Anything that would happen with   them, they have a supermajority, and anything that might happen   would continue to concentrate that power. So, you look at these   tech companies later on issuing non-voting shares, or with   Facebook, deciding that they want to split its stock and issue C   shares so that Mark Zuckerberg can retain his control of the   company and be able to give away the non-voting shares through   his charitable efforts. Mark Zuckerberg has demonstrated that he   has the right combination of that tech-forward thinking and the   business savvy in order to run one of the world's biggest   companies and do it incredibly successfully. Spiegel and Murphy   don't have that track record.Niu:Right. Zuckerberg has definitely earned some respect.   He's really demonstrated that he can execute on these   bigger-picture strategies and growing Facebook in the way that he   has. The stock split thing is funny because, like you were   saying, he voted it in personally, single-handedly. It doesn't   matter if you didn't like the stock split, which hasn't actually   occurred yet even though it's been approved, because he said it   would happen. But, yeah, you really need to trust   these founders. And Spiegel is 26 or 27. Of course,   Zuckerberg was too, a few years back. But, to your point, he just   doesn't have a track record. And it's like, what has he done   beyond creating Snapchat? You can't really point to any single   great business move and be like, ""That was a really smart   strategy, that was a really good move."" You know? You have to   have a lot of faith.Lewis:One of the other things I'm seeing a lot of people talk   about, digging through the S-1 and doing their homework on the   company, is the company's cloud strategy.Niu:Yeah, this is really an interesting topic for me because   Snapchat is doing something that's really unprecedented in terms   of how they're approaching their cloud infrastructure. Most of   the time, when companies are launching these apps and online   services and consumer-based products, eventually, when they get   to a certain point, they start investing in their own   infrastructure, either by building their own data centers and   servers in co-located facilities that they share with other   companies, or building their own. Facebook is building its   seventh data center, and it's fully owned. Twitter co-locates its   data centers. Snap is not doing any of that. Snap is relying 100%   on third-party cloud infrastructure providers, Google Cloud andAmazonAWS. It's just crazy because the scale at which they're   operating, it would normally make sense to start investing in it   yourself, but Snap is content to basically continue to do this   through third parties. It's not clear if this is going to work,   because no one has ever tried this before, so it's this huge   experiment, and there are a lot of risks because you don't get to   control your infrastructure in your back end, which is incredibly   important to your business, and you're also spending a ton of   money. Obviously, building the infrastructure yourself costs a   ridiculous amount of money. But over time, it will eventually pay   for itself.So, what Snap is doing is that they committed to spending   $3 billion total over the next five years between Google and   Amazon combined. Google is the primary provider, and Amazon is   basically a backup. They're spending $400 million a year on   Google. The spending commitment with Amazon ramps up, it starts   at like $50 million and then it's $350 million by the end. But   that's a huge spending commitment. This is, very specifically,   their largest cost. If you look at their financials, the cost   revenue is predominantly composed of these infrastructure costs,   and cost revenue is greater than revenue. So, they have a   negative gross margin right now because of this strategy very   specifically. At the same time, because of these long-term   commitments, the pressure is now on for the ad business. You have   to grow ad sales to these levels just to keep up with it, just to   break even on gross profit, before you even start talking about   operating expenses.The pressure to grow the ad business is incredibly high, and   they have almost no experience doing that. So, it's a huge risk   not only operationally, but it's also a huge risk financially. If   you are unable to grow your ad business enough to cover these   costs, you're just going to be hemorrhaging cash. And it doesn't   matter how popular the service is, if you're just blowing through   money and you can't bring in enough to cover these costs, it's   not sustainable. We don't know if they'll be able to do it or   not, but the point is, the risk that's there is insane. They have   to really turn up these ad sales just to cover their spending   commitments.Lewis:Yeah, beyond all of the general investor interest in Snap   that will undoubtedly be there for the next couple years and   beyond, I think there will be a lot of tech insiders watching   this decision. If it works, maybe they'll use it as a blueprint,   and decide that it allows the company to be more nimble. But, you   have to wonder about the company's ability to control costs, and   have total control over what's going on with the IT   infrastructure, because that's how everyone is interacting with   their product.Niu:Yeah. Everyone in the cloud infrastructure market is   watching very closely, because they're like, ""This is crazy, how   much this company is spending."" It's great news for the cloud   infrastructure market, of course, because it's one of the biggest   customers out there. They're bringing in a lot of money, and   everyone is going to see if this can really work. I mean, it's   worth noting that Snap is hedging itself saying it might   eventually -- in the S-1, it says they may choose to invest in   its infrastructure at some point. A few months ago, they   actually poached Amazon's head of data centers for AWS. So, it's   like, there are some hints that they're exploring the idea of   doing their own infrastructure. But, at the same time, it   probably wouldn't be for the next five years because of these   commitments. So, yeah, they're still leaving themselves an   out. But it seems really risky. It might work out great. In   the event that things go down -- let's say the service just   crashes -- that does let them ramp down variable costs with more   flexibility, as opposed to, if you spend all this money to build   all this infrastructure and the service dies for whatever   reason, theoretically, then you would be stuck with all   this infrastructure you paid all this money for. Versus, just   paying it as a variable expense based on usage. So, it's going to   be something that's going to be very interesting to see play out,   not just because of Snap, but also because of the implications   for the bigger companies that are providing these services like   Amazon and Google, alsoMicrosoft. Microsoft would certainly like to get a piece of that spending.   But yeah, I think that has a lot of implications for the   broader infrastructure market.Lewis:To bring it back around to the stock itself and how   we're looking at it, it seems like you and I are in the same   camp here -- we have some concerns over user   growth, the valuation as it's currently being reported,   we'll see what happens after they run through the   roadshow, but the valuation is a little too rich for us to   really even look at too much, also we have a lot of   questions about the competitive risks with   some Facebook and Instagram looming out there, and   possibly being able to just grab features and drop it on their   installed base. Does that wrap how we feel about   Snap? Anything else you want to add in there, Evan?Niu:I don't think Snap's investable, honestly. There are so   many risks, the financials don't make sense, the valuation   doesn't make sense, you get no voting. [laughs] I don't   doubt that shares will pop from the offering just because of   the hype, but as we've seen with many overhyped IPOs in   recent years, it only takes a few months for the market to   sober up. Plus, Snap's also doing a different thing with the   lock-up period. Employees will be able to sell sooner -- the   lock-up expires for employees sooner than is typical.   Normally, it's about 180 days. They're going to allow   their employees to sell at 150 days, along with all the   co-founders. So, there could be some selling pressure as all   these investors and employees cash out. The employees and all the   insiders are going to make a ton of money, but as far   as public investors go, I don't know. It's also worth   mentioning that their stock-based compensation   expenses so far are quite small because they're still   private. I think last year it was something like $30-some   million, which is a tiny proportion of their expenses.   But when companies go public, the liquidity   event triggers a ridiculous increase in stock-based   compensation cost because now that stock is worth so much   more. And that's typical for all companies that go public   -- right after they go public, they have a huge   increase in stock-based comp. That's something to be aware   that is coming. Plus, they're probably going to start   unloading pretty quickly. I don't know, I just don't   see, after the initial honeymoon, how this thing can really   go even further, after it's already at such a ridiculous   level. You know what I mean?Lewis:I am absolutely with you. Listeners, you can be sure that as   details start to crystallize and we get a better sense of   what's happening with the Snap IPO, we'll be sure to do an update   on this episode as market conditions clear up a little bit.   But, for now, I think that does it. Evan?Niu:Yeah, I think we hit it.Lewis:Listeners, that does it for this episode ofIndustry Focus.

Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Sues Uber Over Allegedly Stolen Technology;2/24/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAlphabet Inc's(NASDAQ:GOOG,GOOGL) Waymo is suing Uber for using technology that it claims was stolen from it by a former employee.makeArticleAd();Source:GoogleWaymo, the self-driving car company that belongs to GOOGL, claims that one of Uber's employees stole technology from it and used it for the company's own self-driving car efforts. The company says this employee is Anthony Levandowski.Anthony Levandowski is the founder of Otto. Otto is a self-driving car startup that was created in 2016. Uber bought this startup in 2016 and added Levandowski to its team. Levandowski was a previous employee of the GOOGL car company before founding Otto.According to Waymo, Anthony Levandowski downloaded more than14,000 confidential and proprietary design filesfor its hardware systems six weeks before resigning from the GOOGL company. Among those files were the company's design data for its LiDAR system.Waymo says that it has decided to file a lawsuit against Uber after receiving an email from one of its suppliers. The supplier makes parts for the GOOGL company's LiDAR system. In the email was a picture of a circuit board for Uber's own LiDAR technology. Waymo says this circuit board looked incredibly like the one it created for its own LiDAR system.Waymo says that after conducting some research, it has discovered that other former employees also downloaded confidential information from the company. These employees now work for Uber and Otto. The GOOGL company claims this was an organized act to steal its trade secrets and intellectual property.Waymo also claims that Anthony Levandowski expressed his desire to ""replicate"" the company's technology as a rival. It claims he told employees of this plan months before his retirement.More From InvestorPlace7 Dividend Stocks for the Retirement You Deserve7 Marvelous Mid-Cap Stocks to Buy for the Best of All Worlds10 Super-Safe Dividend Growth Stocks to Buy TodayThe postAlphabet Inc (GOOGL) Sues Uber Over Allegedly Stolen Technologyappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Considering the Snapchat IPO? Go With Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Instead;2/24/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIn a few weeks, theSnapchatIPO will hit the markets, and it seems like a pretty good bet that there will be quite a bit of interest in the deal. But unless you are a mega-wealthy investor or manage a financial institution, you'll likely not get any shares in the offering. Rather, you'll have to buy SNAP in the after-market, when the valuation will probably be much higher.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockSo is it any wonder that IPOs can be a raw deal?That may be true, but when it comes to investing in the big-growth opportunities, there really is no need to speculate in the IPO market. Hey, there are a variety of interesting stocks currently on the market that should be good enough.Take a Look at GOOGL StockOne to consider is actuallyAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG). Granted, the company is fairly mature, having been founded in 1998.But what's important about GOOGL stock is that the company has global brand, scale, infrastructure and massive user base to play in critical growth markets. Such factors are must-haves for getting the attention of sponsors, especially those that have massive budgets.The 10 Best Stock Charts on Wall Street Right NowThis is why a company likeTwitter Inc(NYSE:TWTR) has struggled so much. In fact, in the latest quarter, the company's revenues increased by a mere0.9% on a year-over-year basisto $717.2 million, marking the 10th consecutive quarter of top-line deceleration. U.S. revenues fell by 4% to $440 million and of course, the company has yet to generate a profit on a GAAP basis.All this happened even though there were major catalysts from the presidential election, NFL streaming and the holiday season.By comparison, in thelatest quarterAlphabet reported an impressive 22% jump in revenues to $26.1 billion and GAAP earnings of $5.33 billion, or $7.56 per share on GOOGL stock.But this shouldn't be much of a surprise. The fact is that GOOGL is positioned nicely for major growth categories like video (YouTube), mobile (Android, Google Play and Waze), devices (Pixel and Google Home) and cloud computing. All these represent multi-billion-dollar market opportunities - and should all provide nice long-term drivers for GOOGL stock.Just look at Waze, which Alphabet Inc purchased for $1.3 billion back in October 2013. Interestingly enough, this price tag may have been a bargain! Note that GOOGL plans to launch a ride-hailing service- similar toUber's- in various cities in the U.S. that is based on the Waze platform.By the way, back in 2013, the company also invested $258 million in Uber.Although, when it comes to GOOGL stock, the real play is likely to be the impact from the company's major investments in deep learning and AI (artificial intelligence). Let's face it, Alphabet has a big-time advantage because of its experience in handling massive amounts of information with search.Already GOOGL is introducing great AI products, such as its Assistant offering (the app allows for sophisticated natural language conversations). But the company has also included more than 350 AI features across many of the company's other products during 2016.According to Alphabet Inc CEOSundar Pichai: ""As I've shared before, computing is moving from a mobile-first to AI-first with more universal ambient and intelligent computing that you can interact with naturally, all made smarter by the progress we are making with machine learning.""More importantly, GOOGL stock is currently trading at an attractive valuation. Consider that the forward price-to-earnings ratio is roughly 22X. Although, if you strip out the $86 billion in the bank, the multiple is 19. And this is roughly in line with Wall Street's 19% five-year forecasted growth rate.OK, then what about Snap? True, growth is ramping at a rapid pace. But then again, the company has only recently begun to monetize its user base, so it does not take much to generate huge spikes.Nordstrom, Inc. (JWN) Stock Looks Great After Q4 EarningsYet it appears that - based on estimates fromGoldman Sachs Group Inc(NYSE:GS) - Snap will churn out roughly$2 billion in revenues in 2018. But this will still mean that the company will trade at over 10 times revenues on atwo-year forward basis. As for GOOGL stock, it is currently at a price-to-sales multiple of 6.4X.So again, if you don't get shares of Snap (and you probably won't - at least the at the offering price), then it's no big deal. Buying GOOGL stock should be just fine.Tom Taulli runs the InvestorPlace blogIPO Playbookand also has his own free iOS app to estimate your tax refund, which is atPathwayTax.com.Follow him on Twitter at@ttaulli.

Aiphabet's Waymo Alleges Uber of Theft of Confidential Files;2/24/2017;"Alphabet Inc.'sGOOGLWaymo has sued Uber and its subsidiary Otto, alleging intellectual property theft and patent violation.In a lawsuit filed Thursday in San Francisco federal court, Waymo accused that former manager at Google's self-driving car project, Anthony Levandowski, had downloaded over 14,000 highly confidential and proprietary files before leaving to work at his newly formed self-driving truck company Otto.Waymo claimed that Levandowski downloaded 9.7 GB of confidential files and trade secrets consisting of design files, blue prints and test documentation from a Google-issued laptop to an external drive and formatted the laptop to delete forensic fingerprints.Waymo also alleged other Google employees who joined Otto to have stolen trade secrets. The company claims that without those stolen stuff, Otto's technology, which forms an important part of Uber's efforts to roll out autonomous vehicles for its ride sharing service, wouldn't have evolved.Alphabet Inc. Net Income (TTM)Alphabet Inc. Net Income (TTM)|Alphabet Inc. QuoteStemmed from an Accidental CC-ingA supplier had mistakenly included a Waymo employee on an e-mail chain that was supposed to be delivered to the Uber team. The attached ""OTTO FILES"" comprised a drawing of a self-driving car Light Detection And Ranging (LIDAR) circuit board quite similar to the one Waymo has been developing secretly.Waymo's lawsuit states that ""The sudden resignations from Waymo, Otto's quick public launch with Mr. Lewandowski at the helm, and Uber's near-immediate acquisition of Otto for more than half a billion dollars all caused Waymo grave concern regarding the possible misuse of its intellectual property.""Reigniting the ConflictThe two camps once lived in harmony. Alphabet executive David Drummond joined Uber's board in 2013 when Alphabet's venture capital arm GV, then Google Ventures, invested $258 million in the company and planned to include Uber rides in the Google Maps app.However, things started to go wrong when Uber decided to develop its own mapping and driverless car technology. The company has opened a technology center in Pittsburgh and hired some robotics specialists from Carnegie Mellon University. It also collaborated with automakers such as Volvo and acquired Otto.Google on the other hand launched a pilot project that enables carpooling in San Francisco Bay Area. Available through Google-owned maps app, Waze, the service is presently under beta testing with a handful of Bay Area companies including Adobe and Google itself. Drummond stepped down from Uber's board last year.The lawsuit certainly complicates the ongoing clash between two of the early leaders in the autonomous vehicle space. Well established car companies like FordF, ToyotaTMand General MotorsGMon the other hand have just started to make their way into this market.Currently, Alphabet shares carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Facebook (FB) Launches Mid Roll Video Ads Beta Testing;2/24/2017;"Facebook IncFBsaid that it will now insert mid roll ads in its video content but as a  ""beta test"" for the time being.In a blog post, Facebook said ""We want to help our partners monetize their premium video content, both on Facebook and on their own websites and apps. The company further stated ""As the name implies, Ad Breaks allows creators to take short breaks for ads during their live videos. When a broadcaster chooses to take an ad break, people watching the video will see an in-stream ad of up to 15 seconds in length. The broadcaster will earn a share of the resulting ad revenue.""Facebook added that the feature will now be accessible to more Live creators. Only Pages and profiles with over 2k followers and 300 Plus views for recent live video can beta test mid roll ads. The first ad break can be taken only after the video has been live for a minimum of four minutes and for more ad breaks, there has to be at least a gap of five minutes between each ad break. Ad breaks will last up to 20 seconds. Ad breaks beta testing will be available only in the U.S for the time being.Analysts observe that ever since Facebook has opted out of pre-roll ads, most publishers haven't been able to earn money from their videos on the social networking platform. Plus, it has kept sports publishers from running ""valuable content"" on the platform.  With mid roll ads, Facebook is giving publishers an opportunity to make more money. Reports add that Facebook will share revenues with publishers in a 45:55 ratio, similar to that of Alphabet'sGOOGLYouTube.Facebook is aggressively promoting ""Live"" in order to boost its top line further. Facebook is trying to bring more video content to attract more ad dollars. Ad revenues contribute over 95% to Facebook's total revenue. It intends to capture the opportunity presented by ever increasing video viewing on social media platforms.

Things have changed somewhat since then and we have slightly greater clarity on whether Google will maintain its own fleet, renting out for delivery of goods, food and/or passenger transport, or whether it will rent vehicles from their makers and sell those services itself.My bet was always on the latter, first because Google is primarily a technology company and thrives on making the kind of software that can take over our lives. Getting into the low-margin business of vehicle maintenance and renting just isn't its area of expertise.Furthermore, the kind of investment that is going into getting these animals on the road isn't justified unless there is a lucrative business out there with a relatively quick payback time.So the company's initial step toward commercialization by getting key people on board and announcing the name of the unit as Waymo was heartening. The goal of this unit is to develop self-driving technology for car makers.How Does All This Tie In with the Waze Carpool   Service?Waze was an Israeli crowd-sourced mapping service providing users with information such as traffic, road conditions and other helpful pointers, so they could quickly decide their route. At least that's what it was in 2013 when Google acquired it for $1.15 billion.Today, Waze is also a carpooling service that gets people travelling in the same direction to travel together and share the cost of gas. So yes, there are headaches to availing the service like having to book way in advance or not having anybody to pick one up on occasion. It also doesn't allow anyone to become a driver, so they can't make a living from it.All this goes to show that Google's plans in the area probably aren't crystallized and the service is a temporary measure to access that all-important thing these days called data. Data that can add to the treasure trove Google's already collecting through the test driving of its self-driving cars.The difficulties don't seem to have deterred users, however, because Google just announced the expansion of the service to unannounced locations in the U.S. and Latin America. And while not all Waze users are signing up for carpooling, it's significant that their numbers have reportedly swelled from 45 million in 2013 to 75 million today. So even if a small percentage of this growing number of people goes for it, it can still be a compelling number.Taxi Service Is What Uber, Lyft Do WellThere's no doubt about it, these two companies have been growing in leaps and bounds as the convenience and quality of service have attracted more and more people. So the prospect of other, perhaps cheaper (because a self-driving car doesn't need a driver) services coming online certainly isn't good news.Google was an initial investor in Uber, but when the company started developing self-driving technology to save its neck, Google representative David Drummond removed himself from its board. Uber still uses Google mapping services, but has increased investments to develop maps of its own.ConclusionUber and its pals have popularized the concept of ride-hailing/car-sharing services but now that the concept has caught on, there will be new entrants. This is a big opportunity for car makers because this is the space where new cars will be deployed in the future.On the technology side, there is the need for machine learning and cloud support, mapping technology, and sensors, which have to be installed on cars built to house the technology. And that's exactly why companies like Intel (NASDAQ:INTC-Free Report) are tying up with companies like Mobileye, while NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA-Free Report) pairs up with Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU-Free Report) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT-Free Report). Then of course there's Google. These companies are in turn testing the technology through collaboration agreements with automakers.But who will get there first? Industry watchers don't expect anything viable until 2020. Even if it's a couple of years out from there, it does look like there will be more than one approach/technology driving the experience. And since the possibilities are tremendous, there won't necessarily be a single winner.Google, Microsoft, Intel and NVIDIA all have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now.

Facebook Inc Stock (FB) Pulls Back After Another High: Now What?;2/24/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFacebook Inc(FB) stock apparently hit a ceiling when it touched yetanother record high- the second record high in less than a month.makeArticleAd();FB shares soared to $136.79 on Wednesday before retreating on Thursday. The previous all-time high for Facebook stock was $135.49, which was set on February 2.Facebook's Stock Move is Just Part of a Wider Tech TrendFB shares also managed a new record closing price on Wednesday at $136.12, ahead of the previous record set on February 8, which was $134.20.As Facebook stock retreated on Thursday, so did most of the other big tech names that have also set record highs this year.Microsoft Corporation(MSFT),Amazon.com, Inc.(AMZN),Netflix, Inc.(NFLX),Alphabet Inc(GOOG) andApple Inc.(AAPL) were all in the red at the time of this writing.And all these big tech names are rising and falling pretty much in tandem with major indices, including theS&P 500,NASDAQ CompositeandDow Jones Industrial Average.Facebook Stock Could Drop Off SoonSo will Facebook stock be able to keep up themomentumfor the near future?Apple Inc. vs. Alphabet Inc: Value or Growth?Seeking Alphacontributor Damon Verial warns that it might not, particularly because it almost always loses in March. He describes himself as ""strongly bullish"" on the name but adds that he only feels ""the urge to write about"" it when he thinks it is overvalued.He says he did call a pullback in Facebook stock in the past when it fell $10 to $123 per share over the four days following his call. Then it fell to $115 over the next two weeks.Of course the stock rallied, as he says it ""always"" will, but he notes that anyone who held through that pullback ""missed a significant buyback opportunity that would have more than accommodated a transition from capital gains tax on long-term holdings to income tax on short-term holdings for most sizable positions.""Verial noted that Facebook Inc (FB) stock has been in overbought territory since the end of January, which means it probably won't take much to set off a downward spiral. He pointed to seasonal patterns in data on the stock showing where it almost always goes in each month.According to him, Facebook stock almost always ends January in the green, and its highest Sharpe ratio also is in January. Average gains during the month stand at 10%.But in February, he said the stock's Sharpe ratio has fallen to zero, making the month neutral. Then in March, the Sharpe ratio turns negative, ""hinting at a significant opportunity cost."" He adds that even long-term holders may find it beneficial to avoid the stock during the worst months, which includes March, May and August. These months aren't usuallyearningsmonths anyway, and they're well after the holiday season at a time when spending on digital advertising starts to fall.He does feel that long is the only ""logical"" position to take on Facebook when looking at it from a long-term fundamental perspective.The postFacebook Stock Pulls Back After Touching Another Record Highappeared first onValueWalk.Many academics claim investing is a ""random walk.""

Qualcomm, Inc. (QCOM) Stock Has Big Prospects Despite Its Problems;2/24/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIt's a bittersweet victory, to be sure. Just whenQualcomm, Inc.(NASDAQ:QCOM) starts to unveil a game-changing technology, a legal hurricane starts to make landfall. If any current or would-be owners of QCOM stock are torn as to what the future likely holds, there's good reason.makeArticleAd();Source:Karlis Dambrans via FlickrAnd yet, as much jeopardy as the company's bottom line may be in at this time, the fact that Qualcomm stock is still down more than 25% over the past three years suggests the market saw a litigation headwind coming sooner or later. The worst-case scenario may already be priced into QCOM stock, which means the recent weakness makes for a compelling entry point.The BadThe legal wrangling is mostly withApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL), superficially. But, should Apple be successful with its effort, it opens the door to other litigation, not to mention emboldens a similar case being brought against Qualcomm by the Federal Trade Commission.The short version of the story: Apple (and the FTC and the Korea Fair Trade Commission, for that matter) are all arguing the same thing - Qualcomm's business model of licensing its technologies to phonemakers isnot only exorbitant, but unlawfully stifles competition. That's a legal no-no in most any country. The Korea Fair Trade Commission isseeking $873 million for essentially the same.The 10 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold ForeverFor the record, QCOM has lost this argument before. In 2015, thecompany forked over $975 million to Chinafor breaking that country's antitrust laws. Indeed, Qualcomm wasallegedly charging all-encompassing licensing feesto phonemakers that may or may not have needed access to all of the technology in that IP package… another dubious practice.Years of sharp dealing have finally caught up with Qualcomm.The GoodThe irony is, while the company was over-milking its aging patent portfolio, QCOM was also developing some new - and highly marketable - intellectual property.The idea of the Internet of Things (IoT) is an exciting one, but the reality is, the technology and bandwidth needed to meet the need just isn't ready, yet. Or, it wasn't anyway. This week, Qualcommunveiled its 802.11ax technology, which can carry four times the amount of data current Wi-Fi technology carries, but without using any more bandwidth.Qualcomm Technologies VP Rahul Patel explained:It is taking Wi-Fi to a new level from a user-experience point of view. What it is trying to do is prepare the Wi-Fi network, which in many cases is experiencing a lot of congestion, largely because the network is becoming dense and is not able to deal with the amount of traffic.At the same time, the company has created a whole new kind of RF ""front end,"" or the radio connection between a mobile phone's modem and the transceiver. Not only is it a superior solution to current alternatives, it's a simpler solution that works with a variety of connection protocols, such as LTE and MIMO, by the utilization of modem intelligence.They're not the kind of advances the average consumer cares about, or even understands. With 5G connectivity about to become the norm, however, these little advances are actually big advances that phonemakers will desperately need.Bottom Line for QCOM StockIn simplest terms, the future of QCOM stock lies somewhere between the two ends of this good/bad continuum. One way or another, sooner or later, Qualcomm's business model of leveraging an aging patent portfolio - and doing so in a questionable manner - is going to falter. If the company wants to continue being an IP player, it's going to need some new IP.The question is, will 802.11ax and new RF front-end platforms be enough? It matters, simply becausethe company's licensing and royalty revenue is roughly twice its revenue from outright chip sales.3 Stocks That Could Soar on a Short SqueezeThe answer to this question is a qualified yes; the qualification is the speed with which lawsuits will result in a decision, and the time that will be needed for IoT and 5G to reach critical mass. Odds are good the former will hurt before the latter helps, meaning Qualcomm could be headed for a dry spell, earnings-wise.Still, for the true long-termer who can stomach the ""in the meantime"" volatility, the market may start to appreciate the potential of the distant future now…after a few years of strong bearish pressure.QCOM stock may not be appropriate for grandma's retirement portfolio, but there's little doubt the company's new technologies will be crucial to the next generation of connectivity.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceApple Inc.

Will Your Next New Car Help Build Maps for Self-Driving?;2/23/2017;"Mobileye N.V.(NYSE: MBLY) , an Israeli company that specializes in advanced   driver-safety systems, has begun rolling out a new offering that   will help the self-driving cars of the near future function in   more areas -- and your next new car might be enlisted to   help.The new offering, called Road Experience Management, or ""REM,""   is a system that will create highly detailed maps that   self-driving cars can use to back up (or double-check) the inputs   from their sensors. It will use data collected by cameras on many   new cars, starting with the 2018 model year.This is a big deal, not just for Mobileye but also for its   customers -- which include nearly all of the world's automakers   -- and people who are hoping to have access to self-driving cars   in the near future.makeArticleAd();Mobileye's chief technology officer, Amnon Shashua, outlined     the company's approach to self-driving in a presentation last     month. Image source: Mobileye N.V.The problem: Self-driving cars need special mapsWhen the first fully self-driving cars arrive on the market in   a few years, their capabilities will be limited. In most cases,   the cars will be ""geofenced,"" restricted to driving in particular   areas. (In the widely used industry nomenclature, these are   called ""Level 4"" systems. ""Level 5"" systems that are self-driving   with no restrictions are probably still many years away.)The cars will be geofenced because most of the self-driving   systems under development require specialized high-definition   maps to work safely. The maps help the car's ""brain"" figure out   exactly where it is relative to things like curbs and road   barriers, providing a layer of redundancy beyond the car's   sensors. (That may sound, well, redundant. But it's critical to   ensuring that self-driving systems meet the required standards of   safety.)Obviously, the companies that can access the best and most   extensive maps will have a competitive advantage. Cars equipped   with their systems will be able to drive themselves to more   places. That means that the race is on not only to create maps   covering the widest possible areas, but to create ways to ensure   that the maps are always up to date.Mobileye has a direct stake in this race. It's gearing up to   bring aLevel 4 system to market by the end of 2019, in partnership withDelphi Automotive(NYSE: DLPH) andIntel(NASDAQ: INTC) . That system will be marketed to automakers, who   will probably be able to have it in showrooms (or in service with   ride-hailing companies) by about 2021.This self-driving test vehicle incorporates a prototype of     the system being developed by Delphi, Mobileye, and Intel.     Image source: Delphi Automotive PLC.The partners will almost certainly have competition from   companies likeAlphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Waymo unit,Ford Motor Company's(NYSE: F)Argo AI subsidiary-- and likely others.Mobileye's Road Experience Management initiative is intended   to make sure that its Level 4 offering is as complete, and as   compelling, as possible. And your next new car might help.How Mobileye will build -- and profit from -- the mapsThe idea behind REM is that Mobileye can use the cameras on   existing cars as a low-cost way to harvest the data needed to   make the maps, as well as other information that will be useful   to self-driving cars. Many new cars have front-facing cameras   that are used for adaptive cruise control, lane-departure   warnings, and other advanced driver-assist systems (or ""ADAS"") --   and many of those camera-based systems were sold to the   automakers by Mobileye.In recent months, Mobileye has been reaching out to its   automaker clients, inviting them to join the REM effort by   allowing data from their vehicles to be collected. In exchange,   Mobileye is offering a share of the revenue it expects to   generate from selling that data to mapmaking companies.So far,Volkswagen AGandBMW AGhave signed up to allow REM to gather data from their vehicles,   starting in the 2018 model year. Duringthis past week's earnings call, Mobileye's CTO Amnon Shashua said that his company expects to   announce a third deal within a few weeks, and to have the   majority of its automaker partners signed up by the end of 2017.   (These deals include extensive privacy safeguards; the data won't   be linked to specific car owners.)Shashua explained how revenue will be generated from the REM   effort:We believe revenue will be generated from two separate     products [of REM]. One is the map, which is a critical input to     autonomous vehicle systems. The other is a broad set of     real-time dynamic information such as traffic density, weather     conditions and open parking spots. We expect the primary     customers for each of these products to be mapmakers, and we     recently announced engagements with both [high-definition     mapping company] HERE and the Japanese mapping company     Zenrin.The upshot: An important step as the self-driving race shapes   upAssuming that a majority of the world's major automakers do in   fact join the REM program, Mobileye's effort stands to put its   venture with Delphi and Intel in a strong competitive position as   the market for self-driving systems takes shape.I've argued that the idea of a ""race"" to self-driving   technologyisn't a useful way for investors to think. Level 4 systems will be available to all automakers within four   or five years; there won't be much advantage to the company that   comes to market first. We won't be able to think in terms of   ""winners"" until the details of the different offerings become   clear.That process is starting. REM makes it likely that the   Delphi-Mobileye-Intel offering will have access to maps that   allow it to operate in many areas of the world, right from the   start. For investors, that makes the success of the partners'   system more likely, and an investment in Mobileye -- the purest   play of the three -- a little more compelling.10 stocks we like better than MobileyeWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

This Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Trade Is a Sure Thing;2/23/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsImmediately after the U.S. elections, the consensus was to buy the small caps and financials. The money had to come from somewhere, so Wall Street sold mega-cap tech to chase the trend then. Stocks likeAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) fell, but eventually recovered. GOOGL stock even set a new all-time high. Then came earnings season.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockThe reaction to GOOGL earnings was brutal - shares fell 6% in four days. Luckily, GOOGL bulls stepped in and defended the stock. As a result, Alphabet Inc has all but erased the entire post-earnings dip.I've always said that the short-term reaction to earnings is purely a gamble. And that the longer-term fundamentals will eventually prevail.My interpretation of Alphabet earnings is that the Google machine is still on rails! It prints money from multiple assets that have more than a billion users; management is a proven winner; and spending on crazy ventures has abated. Alphabet now even have official structures to profit from the self-driving auto arena.3 Covered Calls to Squeeze Dividends Out of Thin AirSo, for the long term, I have no real worry for GOOGL stock other than the general equity market gyrations. If markets sell off, so will GOOGL. Conversely, I don't expect shares to fall too far on their own from the company's own actions.GOOGL Options PlayOptions are liquid enough to allow me to set in motion trades with ample buffers that I expect to be sure winners given the current environment. The trick is to find a level where GOOGL stock will be defended by fundamental investors. Then I sell risk against those levels and sit back and let time work for me.You've read the statistic that most options expire worthless. So I'd want to be a seller of options since the buyers lose most often.The Bet:Sell the GOOGL Jan 2018 $660 put. This is a bullish trade for which I collect $13 per contract to open. The 20% buffer from current price gives this trade a 95% theoretical chance of success. Selling naked puts is dangerous. Not everyone is comfortable exposing themselves to such downside risk. If GOOGL stock falls below my sold put, I am committed to owning the stock at that level. So anything below $647 per share would accrue losses if GOOGL falls 30% or so.Since risk tolerances vary, I will offer an alternate trade with similar metrics but with a finite risk profile. The alternate version would better fit smaller accounts, too.The Alternate:Sell the GOOGL Jan 2018 $670/$660 credit put spread. This, too, is a bullish trade for which I collect $1.25 per contract to open. The price buffer is about the same, so the theoretical chance of success is still more than 90%. If successful, this trade yields 14% on money risked. I still need GOOGL stock to stay above my sold spread to win.Usually, I like to balance my trade by selling opposite risk. In this case, I will offer the option to do that, but I will delay entry a little in this ""animal spirited"" equity market.The Hedge (Optional):Sell the GOOGL Jan 2018 $1060/$1080 credit call spread. This is a bearish trade for which I collect $1.50 per contract to open. I need GOOGL to stay below my sold strike to win. There is no $10 wide spread available yet, so I can't make it a perfect iron condor. This trade, if successful, can yield 8% on money risked.How to Trade Facebook Inc for 470% ReturnsUsually, in perfect iron condors, my potential yield would almost double because I can only lose on one side or the other. In this case, the two sides will balance, but not perfectly. I am not required to hold these options trades through expiration.

Apple Inc. vs. Alphabet Inc: Value or Growth?;2/23/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsChoosing between buyingApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) andAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL) is the classic choice between value and growth. And if you were confused, AAPL stock is the value play, while GOOGL stock provides the growth.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockWhile Apple shares have been on fire in 2017 - up 17% - you can still get in for a price-to-earnings ratio around 16, lower than what investors are paying for the averageS&P 500stock. You also get a dividend of 57 cents per share, more than covered by earnings.GOOGL is the growth play. Revenues increased to $90 billion last year from $55 billion in 2013. This justifies a P/E of nearly 30. The shares are also up 17% over the last 12 months.Right now, investors prefer value over growth and Apple stock is doing better than Alphabet. But this isn't the proverbial choice between a rock and a hard place, instead, it's more like picking between cookies and ice cream. I own both stocks, I have owned them for several years, and I have profited handsomely holding both.The Case for AAPL StockNo technology company is as adept at squeezing profit from hardware as Apple.While other smartphone companies struggle to make money, Apple regularly brings $1 of every $4 in iPhone sales to its bottom line. Its closed ecosystem is perceived as safe and their products last for years.7 Ultra-Cheap Value Stocks to Buy NowThe current case for Apple stock, however, has little to do with hardware. Instead,services now drivethe stock forward. Services like its app store - from which it takes a 30% cut of sales - Apple Music, iPay and iCloud have become huge, with $7.17 billion of revenue in the fourth quarter alone. The success of its services enabled Apple to become a power in the cloud by putting more than$12 billioninto capital spending last year. It's no secret that the cloud is a capital-intensive business, but Apple has been able to out-spend cloud rivals without disturbing its profit machine.AAPL hadover $246 billion in cashon its books at the end of last year, most of it kept overseas. The Trump administration has proposed a one-time tax cut to encourage Apple to bring this cash back to the U.S. That's enough money to buy companies such asComcast Corporation(NASDAQ:CMCSA) orWalt Disney Co(NYSE:DIS) outright.When analysts subtract the Apple cash from its market cap, they find the company itself valued at ""just"" $460 billion, with a PE of 9 and just over two times sales. If you're looking for a cheap value stock, poised for an era of unprecedented growth, with plenty of safety and margin for error, they say, buy AAPL today.The Case for GOOGL StockThe artists formerly known as Google have a different case to make.Alphabet has become acash flow monster, delivering nearly $40 billion in operating cash flow last year. Its revenue grew nearly 20%, and GOOGL's operating margin is over 25%.Clouds scale like no invention ever seen before, and Alphabet delivers a global search service for literally nothing. Its Android operating system is on87% of all smartphones, against just 12% for Apple, and Alphabet doesn't have to build or sell them. It just watches as customers who own them come to its services.But with no fanfare, GOOGL has also become a power in hardware. Its Chromebooks now outsell Apple's Macintosh line with about 5% of the PC market. Alphabet now participates in all the hardware markets pioneered by rivals - from virtual reality headsets to streaming devices - with watches and personal assistants that let you conduct searches of your home or the world with just your voice.Under CFO Ruth Porat, who joined the company fromMorgan Stanley(NYSE:MS) in 2015, Alphabet is finally telling investors how much they're spending on ""other bets"" like robots and self-driving cars, and it's working to make money on those ventures.The Bottom LineIt's hard to see a loser here.Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Is Feelings. Nothing More Than Feelings.The perceived threat to Alphabet is the growing balkanization of the Internet, with national governments seeking to control what people see and say within their borders, and who can profit from it. That has yet to impact GOOGL, but even the perception can hurt a stock.AAPL is currently benefiting from a global flight to safety. Its enormous cash position, its strength as a luxury brand, and its growth in services, which could easily be expanded into competition in the cloud with companies such as Alphabet, are all seen in the best light right now.If pushed to the wall and forced to buy just one right now, I would probably go with GOOG, the non-voting version of Alphabet stock, which shares equally in earnings but sells at a $20 per share discount to the GOOGL shares.But both companies are likeGeneral Motors Company(NYSE:GM) was in the 1950s,International Business Machines Corp.(NYSE:IBM) was in the 1960s, andHalliburton Company(NYSE:HAL) was in the last decade. These are their good old days. We know they will end someday, but that day is not today.Dana Blankenhornis a financial and technology journalist.

Is Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM) In a Dividend Aristocrat Bubble?;2/23/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOn May 23, 1719, one of the greatest financial bubbles in the history of the world kicked off when the Compagnie Perpetuelle des Indes was granted a monopoly by the French monarchy over all the trading rights of all French colonies worldwide.makeArticleAd();The company's stock price quickly soared, from 300 livres per share to more than 1,000 just a few months later. It was quite a jump. But the enthusiasm continued for more than 18-months.In fact there was such a frenzy to buy shares that it wasn't uncommon for the stock price to double in a single day. By November, share price had surpassed 10,000.Based on modern-day calculations, a share price of 10,000 livres would have valued the company at more than the entire GDP of France at the time.That would be likeAlphabet Inc(GOOGL) orAmazon.com, Inc.(AMZN) having a $20 TRILLION stock market capitalization today. Insane.As with all bubbles throughout history, that one burst as well… quickly and violently. Call it 'reversion to the mean'. Stein's Law. Or just plain old common sense.It's pretty simple- there are certain anomalies that are too absurd to last. And nature always finds a way to correct them.7 Dividend Stocks for the Retirement You DeserveWhile it's nowhere near as extreme as the Compagnie Perpetuelle des Indes, the market today is also in a completely unsustainable position.I'll show you what I mean-Take a look atExxon Mobil Corporation(XOM); it's one of the largest companies in the world and a favorite among investors due to its 3.7% dividend yield.Quarter after quarter, Exxon Mobile has been paying dividends to its shareholders without fail for decades, even at the peak of the financial crisis.Not only that, but the company has generally increased its dividend each year as well. To stock investors, that kind of consistency is a gold mine. But there's a small problem.For the last several years, Exxon has been borrowing money in order to maintain its dividend payments. Last month, for example, the company reported $26.4 billion in cashflow from its business operations during 2016.But in order to maintain the business, the company had to spend $16.7 billion on what's known in finance as ""capital expenditures"" or ""capex"". Capex is critical to a big business like Exxon Mobil; every year they have to replace old machinery, purchase more land, etc.If they don't do these things, the business will suffer and revenues will decline. So after subtracting the capex, Exxon Mobil had $9.7 billion remaining in ""free cash flow"".Not bad.Except that, according to the company,they paid $12.5 billion in dividends.Hang on a sec. How is it possible that the company could pay $12.5 billion in dividends when they only had $9.7 billion in free cash flow remaining after the capex spending?Easy. They went into debt. Exxon borrowed billions of dollars in order to pay its shareholders a healthy dividend. And they've been doing this for years. Exxon Mobil is FAR from alone.Verizon Communications Inc.(VZ) is another shining example: in 2016, the company earned $22.7 billion from its business operations, but had $17.1 billion worth of capex. That left $5.6 billion remaining. Yet Verizon paid $9.3 billion in dividends.Once again, the company took on billions of dollars in additional debt.This has been a major trend across the biggest companies in the market.There's nothing wrong with debt; sometimes it can be a smart move that creates value for the company.Our manufacturing business in Australia recently took on some debt to buy some new equipment, for example. It's been a great decision; we're able to generate more revenue with less cost, so the overall growth in our profit is multiples greater than the interest payment.But borrowing billions of dollars just to pay out what amounts to sham dividends is a complete waste of money… and irresponsible.It also means that these record high stock prices are artificial, based on debt-fueled dividends and share buybacks instead of healthy free cash flow.This is totally unsustainable.In addition, with an average P/E ratio of 26.5, stock valuations are at their highest level since the financial crisis; it's yet another layer of risk in this market.10 Super-Safe Dividend Growth Stocks to Buy TodayFew people ever got rich buying what was popular and expensive. But that doesn't stop anyone from trying.Sometimes the hardest thing to do is wait patiently on the sidelines.But successful people don't follow the crowd. They get out in front of the crowd, even if it means being early.The postDividend Aristocrat Bubble?appeared first onValueWalk.Many academics claim investing is a ""random walk.""

2 Reasons Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA) Stock Is Even More Enticing;2/23/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAlibaba Group Holding Ltd(NYSE:BABA) shares continue to move closer to all-time highs thanks to impressive continued growth in China and new international markets. BABA stock is certainly not done running and has a promising future with the company's Cloud division and international expansion.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockAlibaba Australia is the latest in a series of moves to diversify away from China and the company's core business line.BABA opened a headquarters for its Australia/New Zealand operations in Melbourne. The headquarters will help the company expand its already strong relationship with Australia and continue to expand its Cloud offerings outside of China. Alibaba plans on building this headquarters to create operating infrastructure, online payments and cloud computing.Why Alibaba Australia Is Good News for BABABusinesses in Australia and New Zealand have beenusingAlibaba and its Tmall store to get its products into Asia. More than 1,300 Australian brands and 400 brands from New Zealand have products on Tmall. For many of these brands, Tmall was their entry point for China. Australia ranks as the fourth-highest selling country on Tmall, showing the strength of the relationship between it and China.Along with the introduction of a headquarters in Australia, the company hascollaboratedwith Australia Post. This deal will strengthen trade between Australia and Southeast Asia, and ultimately strengthen BABA stock as well. The deal centers around Lazada Group, an Alibaba majority owned subsidiary, that will help bring Australia Post to regions like Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia. Lazada provides merchants direct access to more than 560 million consumers in six countries.7 Ultra-Cheap Value Stocks to Buy NowBrands like Chemist Warehouse, Swisse, and Balckmores areamongthe top brands selling on Tmall from Australia. Popular categories that have helped Australia see strong Chinese sales are health and nutrition, milk power, snacks, coffee and instant beverages.BABA is heavily investing in Australia, with attention being paid to cloud computing and also the selling of goods between Asia and Australia. Alibaba is also actively exploring the real estate market of Australia, which could represent the e-commerce giant's early intentions to take on another area of revenue.The company is considering selling apartments and also facilitating payments for deposits or settlements of apartments through its Alipay payment service. This is just another example of BABA stock spreading itself into new areas through its already existing strengths.The Cloud Computing segment for Alibaba still makes up a fraction of its revenue. However, this unit is fast growing and the company believes it can outpace current worldwide leaderAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN). In the last fullfiscal year, the Cloud Computing segment made up $648 million in revenue. Compare that to the company's Core Commerce division and its $14.7 billion revenue and it doesn't look like much.The investments made by Alibaba in its Cloud division continue to represent the number one reason to buy BABA stock. Alibaba hasplacednew facilities in four regions to help boost its Cloud division. New Cloud facilities are in the United Arab Emirates, Australia, Japan and Germany.In four years, the company believes it can overtake AMZN as the No.1 cloud provider in the world. Alibaba currently ranks first in China and in the top five worldwide.BABA stock recieved some major positive news for the Cloud division, when itsigneda 12-year deal to provide cloud services to the Olympic Games. This deal also covers an e-commerce platform to sell Olympic branded goods. Alibaba is now able to use its dominance in both commerce and cloud to attract new customers and countries for expansion. BABA will also optimize an Olympics Channel for the Chinese audience.Bottom Line on BABA StockThe financial performance of the company's Cloud division continues to amaze and might explain some of the recent gains. In the recent quarter, overall revenue was up 54%. The company's main Core Commerce division gained 45% from the prior year. Cloud revenue grew a brilliant 115%.Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Is Still a Top Tech StockAnother key driver for growth is international commerce, which grew 288% from the prior year. Take what you learned from the company's focus and investment on Australia and both of those great growth figures are headed even higher in 2017.BABA stock investors seem to be missing how important this deal in Australia is and the company's recent cloud infrastructure expansion in new international markets are. China's e-commerce continues to grow and Alibaba is a clear winner. The company is not standing still and staying content with just that growth. China is attacking a high-growth cloud market and will come out victorious.BABA stock has performed well over the last year, rising 54%. Alibaba shares are up 17% in the short 2017 year, yet BABA stock is still up only 10% from its highly valued IPO.With the company's expansion beyond China and just being an online retailer, Alibaba is a big buy for investors. I was bullish nearly a year ago sharing BABA stock as away to investin the growth of the Chinese movie business. That remains true today and with the focus on cloud computing, investors have even more reason to buy this Chinese giant.As of this writing, Chris Katje did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace7 Consumer Stocks That Will Knock Your Socks Off7 Stocks to Sell or Short Before the Bears StrikeThe post2 Reasons Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA) Stock Is Even More Enticingappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Is Still a Top Tech Stock;2/23/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsI'm a firm believer inAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL). In the markets, there is an elite group of companies that define their respective industries. For example,Amazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) owns e-commerce, whileFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) has forever changed social media. And for now,Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) is the king of smart devices. But in my humble opinion, GOOGL stock tops them all.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockDon't get me wrong as this is not a slight against any of the above companies. Just let me forward a very basic observation - all these other names essentially require the internet to function. If not directly, then certainly, access to the internet represents their core marketing message.But what happens when you own the internet? That's a theoretical question to everyone except GOOGL.As I mentioned in a prior contribution, thedominanceof the GOOGL search engine is unparalleled. The margin between Alphabet Inc and the next biggest competitor, Bing, is a whopping 300%. It just gets worse as you go down the rankings. By the time you hit fifth place, it's just not even worth considering. In any other industry, such a statement would be the death knell for the competition.Essentially, GOOGL stock is an investment in life itself. Many people thought that thename changeto Alphabet - a play on the financial term ""alpha"" and the gambling term ""bet"" - was cheeky and a bit ridiculous. But it also signified that Alphabet Inc could do whatever it wants because no one can stop it. GOOGL stock was essentially either an asset or a threat, depending on your perspective.Volatility Is a Risk to GOOGL StockUnfortunately, where it matters most for investors, GOOGL stock hasn't always shown its best stuff. True, it's early into 2017, and so far, it's up over 4% year-to-date. Keep that up every month and you're guaranteed a stellar annual return. But Alphabet Inc has also beeninconsistent, as InvestorPlace contributor Chris Tyler points out. For example, GOOGL was looking at closing January at over 6%. Instead, it only secured 1.4%.7 Ultra-Cheap Value Stocks to Buy NowOn a strictly nominal basis, that's not much of a swing. But on percentage basis, it's a much different story. It has been well over a decade since Alphabet stock introduced itself to the markets. The crazy dynamics involved in a fresh tech company should be over by now. Today, GOOGL and its subsidiaries are comparable toGeneral Electric Company(NYSE:GE) if GE was a little more hip.But with great size comes great envy. Alphabet Inc now faces a fundamental problem.Oracle Corporation(NYSE:ORCL) wants to reengage acourt rulingthat went in favor of GOOGL. At issue is the company's generous use of Oracle's Java software in order to design the Android operating system. GOOGL contends that using Java - which is open-source - is fair game. Oracle contends that it violates the ""fair use "" component of copyright law.For those that acquired GOOGL stock, it's an ugly situation that might be a legitimate risk. Here's the thing - whether it's legitimate or not doesn't matter. If the markets think it's a problem, it's a problem. That makes the sighting of what appears to be a bearish head-and-shoulders pattern (between early December until now) a curious development.Don't Panic on Alphabet IncGenerally, it's not the best idea to buy an investment with baggage. Certainly, it's not a good idea when the baggage is from a giant company like Oracle. Ditto that for its 6'3″ CEO that doesn't come off as someone you want to mess with. In other words, GOOGL stock has some challenges.3 Struggling Stocks That Could Make Epic RunsI also don't think it's a coincidence that the head-and-shoulders pattern is emerging right now. If I'm looking at Alphabet Inc purely as a swing trade, I wouldn't go full bore at this juncture. I expect shares to at least test its 50-day moving average, which stands just under $800. It would not shock me, however, to see GOOGL stock slide towards its 200-day moving average, which is around $763.Again, that's looking at Alphabet Inc from a short-term perspective. For those that have a wider time horizon, the king of the internet is as strong technically as it is fundamentally. Aside from some bumps in the road, GOOGL stock is enjoying clear blue skies. Most importantly, those bumps have never affected Alphabet Inc in a permanent way.The bottom line here is that I would be content holding GOOGL stock. Further, any dips are justifiable buying opportunities, not mere contrarianism for its own sake. Alphabet Inc isgoing to $1,000- just try to ignore the turbulence as best you can.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace7 Consumer Stocks That Will Knock Your Socks Off7 Stocks to Sell or Short Before the Bears StrikeThe postAlphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Is Still a Top Tech Stockappeared first onInvestorPlace."

While this may not be in direct competition with Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX-Free Report) it does look like competition for Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOGL-Free Report) YouTube, Spotify and Pandora (NYSE:P-Free Report). It's also definitely competition for eyeballs in what is limited free time for all-Facebook TV AppFacebook has launched a new TV app for Amazon Fire TV, Apple TV and Samsung Smart TV, with possible plans to further expand to other platforms like Microsoft Xbox, Sony PlayStation and other streaming devices. While this will likely enable/support longer video formats, Facebook has said its intention is not to compete with Netflix but rather to enable Facebook users to watch their preferred video on just about any screen of their choice (and that includes TV screens).Of course that's not the only video announcement Facebook made. The company says that henceforth, videos will play automatically with the sound turned on by default (if the device sound is turned on) and the window will retreat to the bottom corner of the screen so you can keep watching the video while scrolling through your newsfeed. Facebook says that testing is showing a positive reaction from users, although it's obvious that not everyone will be overjoyed.Facebook is also reportedly in talks with music labels to bring their content to the app, which seems like an open challenge to YouTube, Google's competing site. For labels, the new distribution channel will increase their leverage against YouTube for more favorable terms. On the flip side, the chances of piracy will increase given the nature of Facebook's free platform.The increased scope for advertising is also an indication that the company is gearing up to grab its share of TV ad dollars.Apple Getting Ready to Debut Reality ShowEddie Cue, Apple's SVP of Internet software and services used the Recode Media Conference to express a lot of enthusiasm for Apple's soon-to-be released ""Planet of the Apps"" reality show on its music subscription service. Contestants will get 60 seconds to explain their idea on an escalator and could win up to millions in venture capital funding if judges will.i.am, Jessica Alba, Gary Vaynerchuk and Gwyneth Paltrow approve. This is the first attempt by Apple to create original content and will likely be joined by Carpool Karaoke in April (Apple bought out the unscripted version of this show in the summer of last year).Google Fiber RestructuringAlphabet has been trimming staff at its Access unit, which is responsible for its high-speed Internet service called Fiber. But last week, the trimming was more in the nature of hacking as it transferred hundreds of employees to other units, retaining just enough to work in the field. The unit also has a new CEO in Greg McCray, who was formerly CEO of Aero Communications and currently also serves on the board of telecom company CenturyLink.The changes while significant are not really surprising, because Google has had a lot of trouble with Fiber not only because of the expense but also because of tussles with telecom companies over their control on telecom poles. In fact, ever since its acquisition of WebPass last year, speculation has been rife that the company will replace or reduce fiber deployment with a cheaper wireless service. That plan seems to have crystallized now as Google cuts staff but remains committed to expanding its Fiber service.Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations.Get #1 Stock of the Day pick for free.About Zacks Equity ResearchZacks Equity Research provides the best of quantitative and qualitative analysis to help investors know what stocks to buy and which to sell for the long-term.Continuous coverage is provided for a universe of 1,150 publicly traded stocks.

Will Driverless Cars End Traditional Car Ownership?;2/23/2017;"I bought a used car recently, and a few days after I brought   it home, a friend asked me, ""Do you think this is the last car   you'll ever buy?""We talk a lot about self-driving cars, so I knew exactly where   he was going with his question. He was hinting at the   fact that both autonomous car technologies and ride-sharing   services are advancing so quickly that by the time I'd be in   the market for another vehicle, I might not actually need to buy   one.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();By 2035, the IHS estimates there will be 76 million cars on   the road worldwide with some level of autonomy.Even now, semi-autonomous cars that can keep themselves in   their lanes, automatically brake in emergency situations, and   slow down to match the speed of the car in front of themcan be purchasedfor as little as $20,000.And as genuinely driverless cars get cheaper and become   ubiquitous, you and I may opt out of monthly car payments and   opt-in to a monthly mileage subscription service instead.Automakers are investing in this futureTo understand how it's possible that we could soon live in a   world where most people don't own cars, we need to look no   further than what the automakers themselves are doing.Elon Musk's recently updated version ofTesla's(NASDAQ: TSLA)  master plan includes details on a new   service: When the company's vehicles become fully autonomous (by   2018 or 2019, according to Musk), Tesla owners will be able to   allow their vehicles to drive themselves around and be rented out   by other people.As Musk wrote:You will also be able to add your car to the Tesla shared     fleet just by tapping a button on the Tesla phone app and have     it generate income for you while you're at work or on vacation,     significantly offsetting and at times potentially exceeding the     monthly loan or lease cost.Image source: Tesla.Musk also said that Tesla would deploy its own fleet of   driverless vehicles for rent in areas where there was more demand   for Tesla vehicles than privately owned cars could meet, so that    ""you can always hail a ride from us no matter where you   are."" Remember, this isn't the catchphrase of a taxi company, nor   even a ride-hailing service -- but rather the direction where   Musk sees his automaker headed.And just in case think this mentality is unique to the   innovative Tesla, consider whatGeneral Motors(NYSE: GM)  is doing. The giant automaker launched a   ride-sharing service last year called Maven, which allows some GM   owners to rent out their vehicles when they're not in use. The   cars don't drive themselves yet, but the company sees it as a   first step toward a future where people are less inclined to own   cars.In a press release at the time, GM said that more than 25   million of its customers around the world will use some form of   shared mobility by 2020, and describe Maven as ""a key element of   our strategy to changing ownership models in the automotive   industry."" Maven has spread to 17 cities across North America in   just 11 months, has 22,000 members, and has been used for 57   million miles of driving.Not to be outdone,Ford(NYSE: F) has launched i ts own ride-sharing service, and is   developing autonomous cars just like GM. Ford has made it clear   that it intends to launch a ""high-volume"" driverless car paired   with ride-hailing and ride-sharing services by 2021. The   company is already testing 30 self-driving Fusion Hybrids in   several states, and plans to triple the number of test vehicles   this year.Other automakers are moving in this direction as well.Fiat Chrysler(NYSE: FCAU) is working withAlphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google to test a fleet of 100   self-driving minivans that will be the basis for aride-hailing serviceset to launch later this year. It's still unclear what the   service will look like, or if Fiat Chrysler will play a critical   role in it, but what is clear is that the automaker believes in   the viability of Waymo's cars-as-a-service goal.Will this really end car ownership?It's hard to answer this question conclusively, of course.   After all, most people haven't even seen a fully autonomous   vehicle on the road, let alone ridden in one.But John Zimmer, the co-founder and president of   ride-hailing company Lyft,believes thatby 2025 ""private car ownership will all-but end in major U.S.   cities."" Lyft expects the majority of its vehicles to be   self-driving by 2021, and rival Uber is testing similar   strategies as well.Others have set similar timelines for the demise of car   ownership. Georg Bauer, who has held executive positions at   Daimler, BMW, and TeslatoldBusiness Insiderlast year that he thinks car ownership could be dead within   five to 10 years.Government regulations and our own apprehension about giving   up control over our vehicles may preserve the widespread car   ownership culture for longer than some expect. But what's crystal   clear is that tech companies and automakers alike are betting on   an automotive future that looks very different than today. Like   many things, the transition from owning cars to renting   driverless ones on an as-needed basis will likely occur in stages   -- but let's be clear, things are certainly moving in this   direction. And I, for one, would welcome a world without car   payments.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

PowerShares QQQ Trust (QQQ): Short the Titans of Tech;2/23/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe rally inPowerShares QQQ Trust, Series 1 (ETF)(NASDAQ:QQQ) has reached epic proportions as the tech rally moves relentlessly higher on a daily basis. Like all good things, however, it will eventually come to an end. And the end is nigh for the Nasdaq. I expect QQQ to have a meaningful pullback over the coming few weeks.makeArticleAd();QQQ is comprised of the top 100 Nasdaq stocks, with the largest five holdings comprising nearly 40% of the index. These are the heavyweights of tech, with names likeApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL),Microsoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT),Amazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN),Facebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) andAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL).While the valuations given to AMZN and FB have always been rich (or perhaps absurd), now even Apple, the biggest component of the QQQ, is no longer the value stock is was a year ago. AAPL currently sports a price-to-earnings multiple over 16, by far the highest over the past year.Click to EnlargeYear-to-date, the QQQ is up a stunning 10%. To put that in a different context, if the Q's maintained the torrid pace of the rally, it would end up the year with a gain of 97.8%. Of the 34 trading days this year, QQQ has been up 27 days and down only seven.In February, there have been 12 up days and only two down days, with the two down days only being 11 cents and 4 cents.Certainly might be difficult to sustain that type of pace going forward.7 Ultra-Cheap Value Stocks to Buy NowThe Q's are by far the most overbought in the past two years with a 14-day RSI reading over 85. Readings at these extremes are rare indeed, especially for an index or ETF.Click to EnlargeImplied volatility (IV) is priced at the lowest levels over that time frame, meaning option prices are cheap, trading at only 4%. Yesterday saw notable put trading in the QQQ, with an inordinate amount of put selling. This type of action is usually indicative of tops in the underlying shares.So with the Q's at grossly overbought levels and with option prices dirt cheap, taking a bearish position using long put options makes a lot of sense.QQQ Trade IdeaBuy QQQ March $130 puts at $1.50 or better.These are the at-the-money puts and cost only 1.1% the price of the QQQ. With IV at low levels, gamma is high, meaning these options are poised to move. A mere 2% pullback over the coming few weeks would result in a doubler for these options.Those wishing to defray some of the exposure could elect to sell shorter-term weekly options against the long traditional Mar $130 puts.As of this writing, Tim Biggam did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Mobileye NV Q4 Earnings Are Good Enough for Now, But …;2/22/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsI've long thoughtMobileye NV(NYSE:MBLY) is too expensive. Mobileye has an interesting opportunity in driver assistance, and eventually, autonomous driving. But it also has intense competition from companies ranging fromNvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA) toAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL) to Tier 1 suppliers likeDelphi Automotive PLC(NYSE:DLPH) andAutoliv Inc.(NYSE:ALV). But I haven't shorted MBLY stock - yet - and I hardly thought Mobileye's fourth-quarter earnings on Wednesday presented an opportunity.makeArticleAd();Source:U.S. Embassy Tel Aviv via FlickrAfter all, MBLY is a story stock, and the story looked strong heading into Mobileye earnings. A series of deals and partnerships announced in the past few weeks led MBLY stock up 35% from late December lows. Optimism around autonomous driving and increasing automotive technology continues to rise; there's a reasonTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) stock is near all-time highs. Betting against that in the short-term seemed foolish.That story appears to hold for a little while longer, as Mobileye earnings out Wednesday morning came in ahead of consensus estimates and the company's own guidance. In response, MBLY stock reversed from modest gains to modest losses back to 2%-plus gains again in premarket trading. That seems to imply that investors already are looking forward.But it's there the Mobileye story might have some holes.Mobileye Earnings Look SolidMobileye earnings for Q4 beat both Street consensus and its own guidance on the top and bottom line. Revenue of $104.6 million, in particular, looks impressive. MBLY had guided for roughly $96 million coming out of Q3 in moving expectations to the high end of a full-year $344 million-$350 million range. Heading into the earnings report, analysts largely backed those projections.7 Ultra-Cheap Value Stocks to Buy NowThe beat, then, implies growth roughly 11 points higher than thought, with revenue growing almost 46% year-over-year.The driver (no pun intended) appears to be aftermarket sales. Those sales - largely dash-mounted systems on existing cars, rather than installed systems in new cars - increased 156% year-over-year. MBLY management had raised full-year projections for that division after Q2 to 20% of total sales. In fact, Q4 Mobileye earnings show the aftermarket drove 23% of full-year revenue, with sales increasing 113% for full-year 2016.Earnings per share beat consensus and implied guidance by 2 cents, which implies that profit margins were roughly as expected. The reason likely is that aftermarket sales offer lower gross margins, and thus aren't quite as profitable. MBLY has improved gross margins in the business, but mix seems like the most significant reason why the company didn't better leverage sales growth.Long-Term Questions Remain for MBLY StockThe fact that the revenue beat came from aftermarket growth isn't quite the outcome that Mobileye stock bulls would have preferred for Q4.The exciting business here is in OEM, from both the standpoint of market opportunity and profit margins. While 113% growth for aftermarket sales is nothing to sneeze at, it's still off a rather small base. And $82 million in aftermarket sales for 2016, on its own, isn't near enough to support a stock with an enterprise value over $10 billion.That seems to mean investors are looking forward. 2017 guidance on the conference call is for EPS of $1.01-$1.05 and revenue of $490 million-$505 million. Earnings appear just shy of analyst estimates of $1.04, while revenue of $490 million-$505 million suggests an outperformance to Street expectations of $491 million.That combination, however, means margins will be a bit lower than forecast by analysts. That, in turn, likely comes from a higher-than-expected proportion of aftermarket revenue - again, not what the bulls necessarily wanted to hear.And that may be enough for some of the long-term concerns to enter the narrative in MBLY stock in post-earnings trading.Looking ForwardMorgan Stanley downgraded Mobileye stock at the beginning of the month based on margin concerns - a move that took MBLY stock down 3%. And the ability of Mobileye to maintain margins is a big concern of mine, longer-term.I'm still skeptical that any semiconductor company can hold pricing (and thus margins) longer-term. One of the few exceptions, of course, is Nvidia itself. But Mobileye stock, now trading at ~45x 2017 EPS, still is priced higher than NVDA, and part of Nvidia's huge gains over the past year have come from optimism over prospects for its Drive PX 2 platform.How to Trade Facebook Inc for 470% ReturnsThat platform is what Tesla turned to after its relationship ended with Mobileye (and somewhat acrimoniously). That decision alone illustrates the long-term challenges. Competition will be intense, and pricing will be too. It's important to remember that MBLY is a semiconductor company (though it has software capabilities, admittedly) and an automotive supplier. Neither industry traditionally gets very high earnings multiple, because both businesses are extremely tough.For Mobileye to be an outlier on both fronts, its execution needs to be perfect, and its growth flawless. Mobileye earnings for Q4 show a step in the right direction from that standpoint.But with the earnings beat driven largely by aftermarket sales, that step probably isn't big enough for MBLY stock to take another step higher.As of this writing, Vince Martin did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace7 Tech Stocks That Could Implode at Any Minute9 Top Pharmaceutical Stocks to Buy for the Dividends7 Dividend Stocks for the Retirement You DeserveThe postMobileye NV Q4 Earnings Are Good Enough for Now, But …appeared first onInvestorPlace."

Could Apple Inc. (AAPL) Be The First Ever $1 Trillion Company?;2/22/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsI stumbled across a prediction last week that would impress even Mad Money's Jim Cramer.makeArticleAd();According to a recent report from Oxfam, an international charitable organization, Bill Gates has a shot at becoming the world's first trillionaire. Oxfam speculates that if the returns on the tech mogul's $75 billion fortune in the next 25 years are similar to those in the last 25 years, Gates has a shot at jumping the $1 trillion mark.That got me thinking, if one man has a shot at becoming a trillionaire, certainly one of theS&P 500′s biggest companies has a shot at becoming the world's first $1 trillion company?Turns out, a few do.I see five S&P 500 companies with a shot at breaking the $1 trillion mark in the next five years.-Facebook Inc(FB) is the smallest company on the list with a market cap of $386 billion. Facebook's share price would need to hit $345, up 159%.-Amazon.com, Inc.(AMZN) has a market cap of $400 billion. Shares would need to hit $1,980, up 125%.-Microsoft Corporation(MSFT) has a market cap of $498 billion. Shares would need to hit $130, up 100%.-Alphabet Inc(GOOG) is currently worth $570 billion. Shares would need to hit $1,431, up 70%.I believe every one of these companies will eventually be worth $1 trillion. However, one other company will beat them all to it.Thanks to a variety of factors,Apple Inc.(AAPL) is set to become the first $1 trillion company in the world in the next five years.The company has been on a roll. After beating fourth-quarter earnings by 4%, shares just hit a new all-time high above $135.That gives Apple a market cap of $710 billion, making it the largest company in the S&P 500. It has also placed Apple within striking distance of the $1 trillion mark. Shares of Apple would only need to climb 50% to $200 to give it a market cap of $1 trillion.7 Tech Stocks With Explosive Growth PotentialThat is well within reach.If its current valuation stayed the same, Apple would need to grow earnings by 8% annually in the next five years to hit that target. As it stands, Apple is expected to grow earnings by 8% this year and another 13% in 2018. Those two years alone get Apple almost half way to 50% earnings growth.But even if Apple's earnings grow slower than expected, it has an ace up its sleeve.Apple Has $246 Billion In Cash On Its Balance SheetApple's cash position is larger than the GDP of most countries. In recent fourth-quarter results, Apple's reported a cash position of $246 billion. Some of that cash is already accounted for in Apple's $700 billion valuation. But not all of it.Using as little as half of its cash balance to repurchase shares adds another $125 billion to Apple's market cap.Apple's Is One Of The Most Undervalued Stocks In The S&P 500Apple is one of the most undervalued stocks in the S&P 500. Its forward P/E ratio of 15 is a discount to the S&P 500s 20. That lower valuation exists despite the fact that Apple is projected to grow earnings faster than the S&P 500 in the next five years.Technically speaking that means Apple should be trading with a higher P/E ratio than the S&P 500. If Apple traded with the same P/E ratio as the S&P 500, shares would shares would climb 25%, giving Apple a market cap of $887 billion.Warren Buffett Just Made A Huge Investment In AppleApple's pursuit of the $1 trillion threshold has attracted the attention of the world's greatest investor. In recent regulatory filings, Berkshire revealed it had quadrupled its ownership in Apple to 57 million shares. Buffett's stake was worth approximately $6.6 billion at the end of 2016.With shares of Apple already up 17% on the year, Buffett has pocketed a quick $1.1 billion gain in less than six weeks.7 Dividend Stocks for the Retirement You DeserveRisks To Consider:Apple has struggled to launch new hits in the last few years. Although sales growth in its most important product the iPhone is still strong, Apple isn't the innovative company it was under Steve Jobs.Action To Take:Apple is on pace to become the world's first $1 trillion company. Even though shares are trading at an all-time high, I see plenty of growth and gains ahead. Buy shares anywhere below the all-time high and hold until Apple becomes the first $1 trillion company in the world.Editor's Note:Tech companieshave a history of turning stockholders, secretaries and even janitors into ""overnight"" millionaires.In 2017, innovations in virtual reality will do the same for owners of these 2 stocks…StreetAuthority's mission is to help individual investors earn above-average profits by providing a source of independent, unbiased - and most of all, profitable - investing ideas.

Mark Your Calendars: This Is When You Can Buy the Snap IPO;2/22/2017;"The most highly anticipated IPO of the year finally has a date   set to begin trading.Snap(NYSE: SNAP) will price its shares on March 1after the market closes, which means investors should be able to buy shares on March   2.Snap expects to price its shares between $14 and $16, and it   will sell 200 million shares with 30 million in reserve to raise   as much as $3.7 billion. The share price range represents a   market cap between $19.5 billion and $22.2 billion. That's short   of the $25 billion sources originally reported late last year,   and very close to the valuation at which Snap raised funds during   its series F round about nine months ago.How does Snap's IPO pricing compare to competing digital   advertisers, and should investors grab shares on March 2?makeArticleAd();Image source: SnapA look at valuationAt its IPO, Snap will be worth about $21 billion. That's a bit   more thanTwitter(NYSE:TWTR) , but considerably less than ad giantsFacebook(NASDAQ: FB) andAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) .CompanyValuationPrice-to-Sales RatioSnap$21 billion*51.9Twitter$11.7 billion4.6Facebook$386.5 billion14.1Google (C shares)$580.9 billion6.4Data source: Snap S-1/A and Yahoo! Finance *Based on the   midpoint of Snap's expected pricing range.Despite its relatively small valuation, investors will still   be paying a huge premium for Snap based on its sales. Last year,   the company brought in just $405 million in revenue. By   comparison, Twitter brought in more than six times as much ($2.5   billion). Snap and its underwriters think a dollar of its sales   is worth more than 10 times as much as Twitter's.Granted,Twitter is expected to see sales declinethis year, while analysts believe Snap could grow revenue around   150%. Still, Snap will trade at a huge premium to the still   rapidly growing Facebook and Alphabet, which are expected to grow   sales 37% and 18%, respectively.But the IPO pricing is still attractiveSnap's IPO pricing is still somewhat attractive however,   if but for one reason. It's nearly the same valuation as its last   round of funding. Snap's trailing 12 months of revenue for that   round was just $93.5 million. Snap will IPO at about one-quarter   the multiple of its last funding round.In that light, Snap's price looks much more reasonable. If   some of the smartest venture capitalists were willing to invest   when Snap's latest advertising products were still at their   earliest potential, it may well be worth it for investors now   that Snap has proven those products work. And if they can get it   at the same price, so much the better.You probably won't get Snap shares at $16Unfortunately, it's highly unlikely you'll be able to buy   shares of Snap at its IPO price on March 2. Since its planning to   price shares around the same price as its last round of funding,   Snap is potentially setting the stock up for a pop in the stock   price before it opens on the New York Stock Exchange.That's good for Snap. Even though Snap will only receive funds   at the price it sets on March 1, a first-day pop in the stock   price makes it look much more attractive. (Remember what happened   toFacebook stockafter its botched IPO?)Snap itself is only selling 145 million to 175 million shares   of the company's 1.2 billion shares outstanding, so it's not   leaving too much money on the table, either, by keeping its IPO   price low. The other 55 million shares will come from early   investors and company officials.If you're lucky enough to have a broker that's offering you a   chance to get in on the Snap IPO price, it may be worth   considering buying a stake in the company. Even at $16 per share,   however, it's still extremely risky. But don't be surprised if   Snap doesn't trade publicly for that price for a long time -- if   ever.10 stocks we like better than Snap Inc.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Warren Buffett Might Make These 3 Driverless Car Investing Mistakes;2/22/2017;"Warren Buffett is well-known for having, among the core tenets   of his investment strategy, a preference for companies with   serious ""competitive moats"" -- attributes that give them the   ability to sustainably keep ahead of their competition. But based   on his rues, Buffett would never invest in an emerging industry   like self-driving cars, and his competitive moat ideas don't   necessarily hold water in this world. If you're a fan of the   Oracle of Omaha, beware of following his investment philosophy   into these three mistakes.1. Focusing too much on sizeImage source: Alphabet (Waymo)makeArticleAd();Economies of scale are an important indicator for almost any   company. As the logic goes, the bigger a company is, the greater   its ability to cut per-unit costs.Ford's(NYSE: F) ability to keep its car costs lower thanTesla Motors'(NASDAQ: TSLA) , for example, isn't just based on the fact that   it produces more economically designed vehicles. It's also due to   the fact that Ford produced 1.5 million cars in the third quarter   of 2016, compared to the 24,800 cars Tesla Motors delivered   during the same period.But scalability in the driverless car industry doesn't   necessarily have anything to do with car sales. The automaker   with the best technology may ultimately come out ahead.   Technology is scalable at almost no cost. When Tesla Motors   wirelessly uploads its latest software to its already-sold   vehicles around the world, the company pays nearly nothing in   per-unit costs. The race to build the best driverless car at this   stage has much more to do with technology than with numbers of   vehicles sold, and the quantity of cars a company has sold thus   far isn't a indicator for which company is best placed to scale   in the future.2. Exaggerating the value of network effectsWhat network?Network effects are often touted as one of the strongest   competitive moats around.Facebook, an actual social network, perfectly defines the allure of the   network effect. If everyone is using a specific product or   platform, it can be extremely difficult for another company to   make inroads.At first glance, driverless cars seem to be an excellent   opportunity to build network effects. If one company's cars all   ""talk"" to each other as they navigate the roads, they'll get to   their destinations faster and more safely than competitors' --   right? Wrong. Driverless car technology must necessarily take   into account public safety, and unique, exclusionary networks fly   in the face of a universal platform for safe self-driving cars.   Automakers engaged in this space already know this; it's why   Ford, Tesla, and others are equipping their driverless cars with   the best real-world object detection technology available.When Ford announced earlier last week that it would invest $1   billion over five years in Argo AI, it wasn't because   the startup has thousands of self-driving cars on the road   -- it was because the company's robotics expertise ""gives Ford a   distinct competitive advantage at the intersection of the   automotive and technology industries,"" explained Ford Chief   Technology Officer Raj Nair in a press release. Likewise,Alphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) spinoff Waymo isn't relying on   Google's treasure troves of data to guide its vehicles as they   drive around. Instead, Waymo cars are equipped with sensors and   software designed to detect obstacles up to ""two football fields   away in all directions."" Ford, Alphabet, Tesla Motors, and others   aren't interested in network effects in this arena. They're   interested in their cars having the most acute local-area   awareness they can contain.3. Expecting government regulation to limit competitionRegular regulationRegulation can provide some of the widest competitive moats   around. If only one company is able to meet all the regulatory   requirements of being in a business, it's essentially illegal for   others to try to compete with it. The driverless car industry   recognizes this, and is making moves to ensure a level playing   field for all involved.Alphabet, Ford, Lyft, Uber, and Volvo Cars joined together   last April to create the ""Self-Driving Coalition for Safer Streets, "" a lobbying group whose stated mission is to ""work with   lawmakers, regulators, and the public to realize the safety and   societal benefits of self-driving vehicles."" These companies are   interested in standardizing national policy with simple and   low-cost barriers to entry for all interested automakers. So for   Buffett fans looking to back the company with the strongest   regulation-related advantages, know that some of the biggest   names in the business are working proactively to push   policies that ensure no company can ever build a regulatory   moat.Picking the right self-driving car stockWarren Buffett is an incredible investor, but he doesn't have   answers for every industry. There are many open questions around   self-driving cars, and some companies are morepoised to profitthan others. Rather than sticking to one-size-fits-all investment   mantras,equip yourself with the factsyou need to know, make informed investments, and set your   portfolio to auto-pilot for years to come.10 stocks we like better than Wal-MartWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock     tip, it can pay to listen.

Will Twitter's (TWTR) Fortunes Improve on the Trump Effect?;2/22/2017;"Since its debut,Twitter Inc. (TWTR)has been a social phenomenon but somehow hasn't been able to leverage that success to boost user growth.Twitter has vastly underperformed the ZacksInternet Softwareindustry so far in 2017. We note that shares have declined 10.22% as against the industry's gain of 20.37% during the period.Twitter's Dry RunThough the company has been working hard to bring about a turnaround, its efforts are yet to yield the desired results. Focus on Live video content, a flurry of live streaming deals, user friendly changes, measures to curb the trolling menace, divestment of non-core operations, and layoffs, the company has done it all. But all these are yet to move the needle for Twitter.Moreover, CEO Jack Dorsey has often been widely criticized for playing the dual responsibilities of heading both Twitter and Square, especially when both the companies are at crucial junctures. Dorsey was quoted by media reports saying ""My intention is to serve both companies in every way I know how and make sure that we are really focused on what's most important for each.""Last year, rumors about Twitter's probable sale did the rounds. Big names like AlphabetGOOGLand The Walt Disney Company were speculated to have shown interest in buying the micro blogging site. But t most bidders pulled out of the race. The news managed to drive share prices, albeit for a while, as the easing of the acquisition news led to a drop in the same.Twitter's Trump CardNotably, President Donald Trump used Twitter heavily for his presidential campaign in 2016. Given Trump's excessive usage, Twitter became all the more popular. Now that Trump is in office, he continues to use the same to broadcast his agendas.Trump's tweets have the power to influence markets and make headlines. Twitter reached an all-time intraday high of $25.25 on Oct 5, 2016 when the election campaigns were in full swing. Trump has been breaking stereotypes and making important announcements on Twitter instead of press conferences including his choice of Vice-President, Mike Pence, back in Jul 2016. This practice continues. In the first week of December, through his Twitter account, Trump asserted a 35% import tax. He even took to Twitter to express his dismay when retail giant, Nordstrom decided to drop the fashion line belonging to his daughter Ivanka Trump.An analyst observes that, ""The incessant news flow from the Trump administration playing out on Twitter and the ensuing global reaction pushes Twitter users to be increasingly engaged with the platform.""Despite Trump's penchant for Twitter, there has been no noticeable ""Trump effect"" for the micro blogging site yet. It reported an increase of just 2 million new users in the fourth quarter results that overlapped the presidential election results.Twitter, Inc. PriceTwitter, Inc. Price|Twitter, Inc. QuoteWhat Lies Ahead?Amid the exodus of the top level executives and poor quarterly results, Dorsey's move to buy shares worth $11 million can be seen as an effort to reassure dismayed investors.  Twitter investors have been on the edge given its unabated troubles. Generally it is said that when a founder buys shares of his own company, it implies that the stock has much upside potential.The company has been disappointing investors for a while now, missing revenue expectations and generating poor user growth.  At 319 million users, Twitter falls way behind other social media services like Facebook Inc.FB, which has over 1.8 billion users. Even Facebook's subsidiary, Instagram has over 600 million users.We have always maintained that Twitter's ability to attract advertising revenues amid significant competition from the likes of Facebook and Alphabet will be a key factor determining its growth, considering the fact that investment in product development needs to continue.Currently, Twitter has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A better-ranked stock in the wider technology space is ARRIS International PLCARRS, which has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Equifax (EFX) Expands Technology Center in Santiago, Chile;2/22/2017;"Equifax Inc.EFXis moving ahead with its plans to expand internationally. The financial information solutions company recently announced the expansion of its technology center in Chile. The recent expansion has been made at the company's largest global technology center, which is located in Santiago, Chile.The expanded office will accommodate over 50 engineers. The company anticipates filling the positions with new hiring. Equifax also revealed that the newly expanded office as well as the engineers will mainly focus on ""developing innovative analytical and big data solutions to produce insights"" for all 24 of the company's markets located across four continents.Chile: A Favored Destination for US Tech FirmsChile continues to be a popular destination for U.S.-based technology companies due to a number of reasons. The country has a similar time zone as New York City and has signed various free trade agreements including NAFTA.Moreover, the availability of cheap talented professionals as well as easy immigration policy attracts U.S. companies to open offices in the country. Additionally, the country is a favored destination due to its low corporate tax.Looking at the huge prospects in Chile, Equifax entered the market way back in 2009 by opening its largest technology center in Santiago. The facility is as important as Equifax's technology centers in Atlanta, GA and Dublin, Ireland which support all of its 24 markets in which it operates.Other U.S.-based technology giants who have their data centers in Chile are AlphabetGOOGLaka Google and IntelINTC. Moreover, Amazon'sAMZNAmazon Web Services is planning to open its first data center in the country.We believe that given the availability of a huge pool of talented IT professionals, ease of doing business and economic as well as political stability, the country is well poised to attract foreign companies to open their offices.Global Expansion Driving GrowthFor the last few years Equifax has been focusing on expanding its international footprint. Last year in September, the company opened a second office in Dublin, and employed more than 100 people at the new facility.Apart from this, the company has resorted to acquisitions and joint ventures to drive growth. In Feb 2016, the company acquired Australia-based data and analytic services provider Veda for cash consideration of approximately $1.7 billion (2.4 billion Australian dollars). Veda has been integrated into the newly created Asia Pacific reporting unit within the International segment.Notably, international revenues (including Europe, the Asia-Pacific, Canada and Latin America) surged 49% year over year to $212.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. On a constant-currency basis, revenues soared 62%. The Veda buyout boosted Asia-Pacific revenues from $2.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 to $70.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.Furthermore, Equifax remains enthusiastic about forming joint ventures that could expand its business internationally. Joint ventures keep operating costs down and need no integration time while diversifying the revenue source. To tap the immense growth opportunity in the Brazilian credit data market, Equifax merged credit reporting operations of its Brazilian subsidiary with Boa Vista Servicos S.A., the second-largest consumer credit bureau in Brazil.Equifax also owns roughly 50% in Russia-based credit reporting agency, Global Payments Credit Services LLC, and 49% interest in the Indian credit reporting agency, Equifax Credit Information Services Private Limited (a joint venture between Equifax and 6 Indian financial institutions). The company expects its investments in the joint ventures to yield desired results and help it to register solid growth over the long term.Bottom LineManagement's efforts, such as strategic initiatives for product innovation, expansion of data assets through acquisitions and continuous share gains in North America, should prove to be tailwinds. Also, the company's strong correlation with the consumer and financial markets and exposure in the U.S. and Europe are likely to propel growth, going ahead.The ongoing initiatives have helped the company to post splendid financial results for the last quarter. Equifax's top- and bottom-line results for fourth-quarter 2016 not only came ahead of our estimates but also marked solid year-over-year improvement.Investors have also reacted strongly to the company's overwhelming quarterly results posted on Feb 8. The stock has gained 6% since its last quarterly results, outperforming the Zacks categorizedFinancial Transaction Servicesindustry's gain of just 2.5% during the same time frame.Nonetheless, we expect the company's investments in new initiatives to weigh on its bottom-line results in the near term. Additionally, uncertainty surrounding IT spending and strengthening U.S. dollar are some concerns. Moreover, increasing competition from the likes of Fiserv and Total System Services are the other factors likely to affect earnings in the near term.Currently, Equifax has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

On the back of reports that GM is looking to sell its European operations, along with other positive future-looking moves, the automaker could be poised to keep climbing.GM is up 1.96% to $37.95 per share after early Tuesday afternoon trading. GM is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (BUY) and its shares have been on the rise over the last year.It has been a week since reports surfaced that GM was discussing the sale of its European operations to French-based PSA Group, the maker of popular European car brands Peugeot and Citroën.The deal has already experiencedsome union push back. But German officials have voiced support for the GM and PSA deal asfear of plant closures have been curbed.GM's sale of British-based Vauxhall and German-based Opel to PSA could help its shares rise by 35%, according toa Sunday Barron's report. The deal would make PSA Europe's second-largest automaker by sales, but it could provide GM nearly $1 billion in cash.The European sell-off would also allow the U.S. auto manufacturing giant to pour more of its resources into GM's newest tech-based ventures and markets.InnovationGM has invested heavily in new technologies including ride-sharing and electric cars in the last few years. The automaker paid $500 million to purchase a minority stake in the second-largest U.S. ride-sharing company Lyft. It also purchased the autonomous car technology company Cruise Automation for $1 billion in March 2016.U.S. electric vehiclesales rose 37% in 2016. Despite all of the attention paid to TeslaTSLA, the ChevroletVolt has continued to do well, with December 2016 sales up 62% year-over-year.Heavy investment in self-driving vehicle tech has GM set to test autonomous Chevy Bolts in 2017. GM's focus on autonomous cars puts the company firmly in the race, along with Tesla, AlphabetGOOGLand Uber, to be the first to profit from driverless car tech.Uber has staked a lot of its future on self-driving cars. Now, with GM's help, Lyft has moved into the space as well.Maven, GM's year-old car-sharing service, is now in 17 U.S. cities. The service allows users to rent GM vehicles on-demand for short amounts of time. But unlike rival Zipcar, there is no membership fee. The service boasts that its 24,000 members have traveled nearly 78 million miles.Users can rent Chevy, Cadillac and Buick vehicles on their smart phonesfor an hourly rate of $6 to $8. Lyft drivers can rent a Chevy Equinox for $99 a week under Maven's Express Drive service. And GM is introducing 100 Chevy Bolts (electric cars) to its Los Angeles-area Maven market.""With more than 25 million customers around the world projected to use some form of shared mobility by 2020, Maven is a key element of our strategy to changing ownership models in the automotive industry,"" GM VP of Urban Mobility Programs Julia Steyn said in an initial Maven press release.Growth and New MarketsGM posted record full-year revenue in 2016 of $166.4 billion, up 9.2% year-over-year.

Ride Red-Hot Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock for Free;2/21/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMD) is on a monster run of late. The long trade on AMD stock has been absurdly easy, especially when using options. I've even had success shorting the company recently, but only because I booked my profits quickly.makeArticleAd();Source:Matthew Rutledge via FlickrLast year conditioned me to not overstay my welcome in winning trades.After extended rallies, I am usually tempted to initiate short trades rather than long ones. Today, I will go against my instinct, though, and go long in AMD stock to capture a potential move (unthinkably) higher.Advanced Micro Devices' fundamentals haven't really changed in recent months. We're in a digital world and becoming even more reliant on tech. AMD is one of few who are the major suppliers to the brains of this tech world. This tells me that there is room for all - like rivalsIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) andNvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA) to prosper. So I don't want to short anything just for the sake of shorting.7 High-Risk, High-Reward Stocks to Buy NowClick to EnlargeFurthermore, I see things I like in AMD's stock chart. The price action has been constructive. I see higher lows challenging necklines that if broken upwards can invite even more buyers.I'm not usually one to chase a stock long on a 6%-plus day like what AMD stock is putting out on Tuesday. But the options market makes this fairly easy while leaving room for error.How to Trade AMD Stock NowThe bet:Sell AMD Oct $9 put for 60 cents per contract. By selling this put, I am committing to owning AMD shares at the strike sold. So I only do this if I am willing and able to own the stock at that price. I can even buy sacrifice Apr $9 puts for 4 cents to cover the crash scenario should it come.Usually I like to sell opposite risk to balance my trade, but in this case, I will refrain. In fact, I'll add an extra twist that could provide even more profit potential.Go Long the Super Spike in Tesla Inc (TSLA) StockThe Juice (optional): Buy the AMD Mar $14.5/$15.5 debit call spread for 28 cents to open. If I am correct and AMD stock rallies past my spread, I could gain up to 70 cents per contract. A more aggressive version of this would be to buy naked calls instead.I am not obliged to hold any of these trades through their expiration. I can close any of the for partial gains or losses at any time.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director ofSellSpreads.com.

Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Is the Perfect VALUE Play;2/21/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsI love growth stocks as much as the next guy, butAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL) might just be my favorite at the moment. That's because GOOGL stock has something that a lot of other high-growth dynamos simply don't have:makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');Source: ShutterstockAny value left whatsoever.I'm prudent when it comes to hyper-growth stocks such asAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) andNetflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX). I've missed out on some great runs as a result, but I also haven't gotten burned when growth flags. Instead, I prefer to focus on ""growth at a reasonable price,"" or GARP - and I believe GOOGL stock falls into this category.Go With GARPWith growth stocks, I look for a price-to-earnings ratio of a stock that is no more than 2x its earnings growth rate, if earnings are growing at 15% annually or more. And I want to back out stock buyback effects. To me, a GARP stock has a PEG ratio of 1.0, though I'll allow up to 1.5 depending on the earnings growth rate.GOOGL stock trades at 29x FY16 earnings and about 21x FY17 earnings. Analysts see five-year annualized growth at 19.2%. So on the surface, Alphabet seems to qualify as a GARP pick.The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for 2017: The Experts' PicksBut there's even more good news.This doesn't consider the net cash position of GOOGL stock. See, I value a company net of its net cash hoard, just as Peter Lynch used to do. With $86.4 billion on its balance sheet, that pulls the market cap for Alphabet down to about $480 billion.On $19.5 billion in net income for FY16, we suddenly find that Alphabet stock trades at 24.6 times FY16 earnings and only about 17.5 times FY17 earnings.That's the first step for me in even determining if GOOGL stock is a stock to get involved in.How Is Alphabet's Business?The next thing I examine is how healthy Alphabet Inc's actual businesses are.I still don't like the idea that GOOGL is basically a giant digital advertising billboard with a venture capital arm. However, I can't deny that Google's search engineholds an astonishing 80.47% market share. As long as four out of every five searches are conducted on Google, advertisers will throw money at Alphabet. There would have to be a scandal of monumental proportions, or some incredibly innovative new method of searching, to change this significantly.Alphabet's 17% year-over-year increase in advertising revenue to $22.4 billion comes as no surprise.So next I look at the YOY metrics, which look fantastic Aggregate paid clicks up 36%, paid clicks on Google properties up 43%, and paid clicks on Network properties up 7%. A lot of people freaked out that cost-per-click fell 15%, 16% and 19% for each of the above categories, respectively. The market doesn't seem to realize that this is because more advertising is being pushed to mobile.As for Other Bets, which is basically the company's VC arm, I don't love that it blew a billion dollars in the quarter. But considering free cash flow was $6.33 billion, and net cash is $86.4 billion, GOOGL has that money to spend. With portfolio strategy, all it takes is one of these VC bets to hit, and all that money spent will be made back and more.This brief glance tells me that Alphabet is an advertising business with dominant market share that is literally printing money. I mean, it generated $26 billion in free cash flow in FY16. That'sfreecash flow, meaning it can do whatever it wants with it.Go Long the Super Spike In Tesla Inc (TSLA) EarningsThat's even after spending about $10 billion in capex.Bottom Line on GOOGL StockNormally, I would continue to examine other parts of the business if I were looking to include GOOGLin something like my forthcoming stock advisory newsletter, The Liberty Portfolio.But for right now, I see enough to suggest investors continue their own due diligence and strongly consider GOOGL stock as a GARP play.Lawrence Meyers is the CEO of PDL Capital, and manager of the forthcomingLiberty Portfolio stock newsletter.

Can Amazon's Chime Challenge Microsoft's Skype and Cisco's Spark?;2/21/2017;"Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) recently introduced Chime, an  enterprise   collaboration service for online meetings, video conferencing,   voice calls, chat, and content sharing. Chime's apps work on iOS,   Android, Windows, and Mac, and the content is synchronized across   all platforms via Amazon Web Services (AWS).Chime comes in three versions -- Chime Basis, for 1:1 voice   and video calls and chat; Chime Plus, which adds screen sharing   and the integration of company directories; and Chime Pro, which   adds tools for scheduling, hosting, recording, and personalizing   meetings for up to 100 people.Image source: Amazon.makeArticleAd();These features indicate that Amazon is taking aim at   collaborative tools likeMicrosoft's(NASDAQ: MSFT) Skype andCisco's(NASDAQ: CSCO) Spark. But are those rivals already too deeply   entrenched in the enterprise market for Amazon to disrupt? Let's   take a closer look at Amazon's game plan to find out.Entering the crowded SaaS marketAmazon's AWS, which has an annual run rate of $14 billion, is   the  biggest cloud infrastructure platform in the world.   It's several times larger than its closest competitor,   Microsoft's Azure. But while AWS dominates the cloud platform   (infrastructure/platform as a service) market -- which hosts   storage space, processing power, and other tools for companies   and developers -- it doesn't have a major presence in the SaaS   (software as a service) market yet.The SaaS market is the crowded, consumer-facing side of the   cloud, which includes services like Microsoft's Office 365,   Dynamics CRM, and Skype. The lion's share of Microsoft's   commercialized cloud revenue run  rate of $14 billion is   generated by those SaaS products instead of Azure. Microsoft has   also been expanding Skype's capabilities as an enterprise   collaboration tool with  Microsoft Teams, which enhances   Skype's cloud-based communication features and tightly integrates   the service into Office 365.Microsoft Teams. Image source: Microsoft.Meanwhile, networking giant Cisco aggressively bundles   software and security products with its routers, switches, and   unified computing systems. Those bundles include collaboration   tools like Spark, the cloud-based platform for  messages,   meetings, and calls it launched in late 2015. Last quarter,   Cisco's collaboration revenues rose 4% annually to $1.06 billion   -- making it its third largest business after its  core   businesses of router and switches.But Microsoft and Cisco aren't the only players in the crowded   field of cloud-based collaborative tools.Alphabet's Google has been promoting Hangouts to enterprise customers   over  the past year,Boxhas added collaborative tools on top of its cloud storage   platform, andLogMeInacquiredCitrix's GoToMeeting video conferencing platform for the same purposes.   However, all these challengers notably lack Microsoft and Cisco's   clout in the enterprise market.That's why Amazon believes it can succeedBut like Microsoft and Cisco, Amazon also has leverage -- the   growing importance of AWS to enterprise customers. Amazon likely   believes that by offering Chime as an extension of AWS   (especially with its 30-day free trial) to its enterprise   customer base, it can gain a foothold in the crowded ""unified   communication"" platform market.Amazon previously launched enterprise SaaS products like    WorkSpaces, WorkDocs, and WorkMail, but it hasn't ever   released official growth figures for those products. However,   most industry watchers believe that those products are still   dwarfed by comparable solutions from Microsoft and Cisco. This   strongly indicates that AWS' dominance of the PaaS/IaaS markets   doesn't guarantee that Chime will become a Skype or Spark killer   anytime soon. Chime Pro also  costs more than Skype for   Business -- so it doesn't look like Amazon plans to undercut its   way into the market.The key takeawayChime sounds like a logical way for AWS to straddle the   PaaS/IaaS and SaaS markets, but it's easier said than done. The   market for cloud-based unified communication platforms is   incredibly crowded, and it's doubtful that a new service -- even   one bundled with AWS -- can claim a meaningful slice of the   market. However, Amazon investors should still keep an eye out   for future SaaS products to see if the company can eventually   challenge heavyweights like Microsoft and Cisco.10 stocks we like better than MicrosoftWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

These Are the 10-Most Admired Companies in the World;2/21/2017;"When the public votes for something the results can skew based   on perception, emotion, or sometimes even the desire to mess with   the outcome.That's how a $300 million state-of-the-art British polar   research ship earned the name ""Boaty McBoatface."" The question of   the ship's name was put to an internet vote, and while over 7,000   names were submitted, according toCNN, ""Boaty McBoatface"" won easily with 124,109 votes. Votes being   open to the public have given us many questionable,   past-their-prime Major League Baseball all-stars, as well as a   whale being tracked by Greenpeace being named Mr. Splashy   Pants.These are all ridiculous votes skewed by a playful public, but   they illustrate that sometimes open voting can produce less-than   reliable results. In creating its annualMost-Admired Companies ListFortune does not leave the question open to a public vote,   instead the publication works with its partner Korn Ferry Hay   Group to build a list and then survey executives from the   companies that make the initial cut.makeArticleAd();Image source: Getty.After starting with about 1,500 candidates (the 1,000 largest   U.S. companies ranked by revenue, along with non-U.S. companies   in Fortune's Global 500 database that have revenues of $10   billion or more), the selections are cut down to the   highest-revenue companies in each industry. That leaves 680   companies in 28 countries, and 3,800 insiders affiliated with   those companies voted on the list.""To determine the best-regarded companies in 51 industries,   Korn Ferry Hay Group asked executives, directors, and analysts to   rate enterprises in their own industry on nine criteria, from   investment value and quality of management and products to social   responsibility and ability to attract talent,"" Fortune explained.

The 10 companies above are not             only successful, but those best-placed to judge are             saying they admire them, which should be taken as a             strong positive by shareholders and potential             investors.""Having the respect of your peers and your             competitors is absolutely crucial in business and             almost everywhere else,"" said Fortune's Assistant             Managing Editor Nicholas Varchaver in avideothat accompanied the list.

3 Virtual Reality Stock Investing Tips That Will Pay Off Long Term;2/21/2017;"Virtual reality (VR) is forecast to become a $162 billion   market by 2020, and the opportunities for investors to benefit   are growing. Nearly every major technology company is pursuing   VR, or at least looking into it, and some are spending billions   in order to make it the next popular computing platform.So how can individual investors benefit from all of this?   Start with these three tips:Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();Don't focus on hardwareYou're probably hearing a lot about VR headsets these days.   Oculus released its long-awaited Rift headset last year;Facebook(NASDAQ: FB) purchased the company more than two years ago for $2   billion.Sony's(NYSE: SNE) PlayStation VR headset launched back in October,   giving PS4 users the ability to play and view VR content on their   consoles. AndAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) recently launched its new mobile   VR headset, called the Daydream View. The company also just hired   a key VR headset designer away from HTC, which makes the popular   HTC Vive headset.But don't focus on any of that.VR headsets and other hardware are clearly an important part   of this market, but the real gains will come from software and   services. Tom Mainelli, vice president of devices and AR/VR at   IDC, said last year that ""... what people can do with   that hardware will depend upon the applications and services that   power it.""According to IDC, hardware sales will account for more than half of VR and   augmented reality (AR) revenues through 2020, but that it's   software and services that have the real long-term potential.""AR/VR software revenues will also get off to a quick start,   growing more than 200% year over year in 2016, but will quickly   be overtaken by services revenues in the middle years of the   forecast, as logistics and manufacturing demand enterprise-class   support,"" Mainelli said.The bigger, the betterIn the technology sector, it's often the players that start   out the biggest that win in the end, and virtual reality will   likely be the same.That's why it's important to look at what Facebook, Alphabet,   and Sony are doing in the space. Facebook's long-term goal isn't   to just sell high-end VR headsets, but rather to create the next   widely adopted computing platform.CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in aninterviewwithBusiness Insider last year that Facebook is ""mostly interested in the software""   aspect of VR, though he noted that the early stages of VR   development will require a focus on both hardware and   software.His long-term goal for AR and VR is to create an entirely new   computing platform. ""So I do think a new computing platform   always emerges every 10 or 15 years. VR is currently the most   promising candidate,"" he said.While Facebook is looking ahead to the next computing   platform, Alphabet is busy focusing on how it can gain from the   mobile VR market. The company recently debuted its Daydream   platform for Android users to find VR videos and apps.The importance of this VR hub can't be overstated. Smaller   companies may be making VR content, but Alphabet's Google has   built one of the only places where all of this content can live,   and be easily found. As mobile VR takes off, Daydream will   likely be the place where users go to get their content. Think of   it like a Google Play store for VR.And while Facebook and Alphabet are busy building out   platforms, don't forget Sony's potential to make itself a   powerhouse in the VR gaming market. The company already   working with more than 230 developers and publishers to create   160 PlayStation VR software titles.Sony's Game and Network Services is the company'ssecond-most profitablebusiness, and the company has said the VR ""offers great   future potential"" for the segment.Stay the courseHonestly, the payoff for VR investors will likely take some   time to materialize. That's because while the market is growing   fast, VR represents only a small portion of revenues -- if any --   for many of the companies involved in the space right now.Facebook said its investments in VR weren't material to the   company's 2016 financials, and Zuckerberg has stated several   times that VR probably won't truly take off for another five to   10 years.But that shouldn't be a deterrent for investors. Virtual   reality has the potential to transform how people access   information, view content, and interact with each other. If it   does become the next big computing platform, then taking a   long-term approach to the will be the wise course.Investors should heed this advice Zuckerberg gave last year:   ""We are betting that virtual reality is going to be an important   technology. I am pretty confident about this. And now is the time   to invest.""10 stocks we like better than FacebookWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Ignore the Management Shakeup Drama -- Viacom Is a Fantastic Buy Today;2/20/2017;"Long a pillar of the entertainment industry,Viacom(NASDAQ: VIAB) has fallen on hard times as of late. First, its   Paramount film division has suffered a string of box-office   flops, with its share of the box office falling to just 8% in   2016. Then there's its portfolio of television networks, once the   envy of the entertainment industry, but have suffered amid   increasing competition not only from peers likeWalt Disney, but from the internet itself. Viewers used to have to tune   into Viacom'sMTVto view the latest music video, or to itsComedy Centralnetwork for a laugh -- now consumers need only head over toAlphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOGL)YouTubefor the latest hit song and a laugh.However, for reasons that are detailed below, shares in the   entertainment conglomerate offer a compelling value to   prospective investors. Read on to learn more.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();Recent eventsThere's no other way to put it -- the last year or so has   tumultuous within the C-suite of Viacom's management. The drama,   which has been more than covered by the media, culminated with   theresignation of multibillionaire Viacom   Chairmanand former CEO Sumner Redstone. Now, with the appointment of new   CEO Robert Bakish, the situation appears to be on the mend, which   is great news, because all has not been well, not only in the   C-suite, but on the income statement as well:Metric20162015ChangeRevenue$3.32 billion$3.15 billion5%Operating income$706 million$839 million(16%)Diluted EPS$1.00$1.13(12%)Data source:Viacom February 9, 2017 Quarterly Earnings   Results.While revenues were obviously headed in the right direction,   profits were not -- which partially explains the company's low   earnings multiple. However, this has not always been the case. In   fact, lackluster growth could very well be considered an anomaly   in the company's operating history.A look backHistorically, Viacom has a history of profit growth and solid   returns on capital. In fact, its record over the years has been   quite good.VIAB Normalized Diluted EPS (TTM)data byYCharts.Alas, perhaps caused by or contributing to the myriad problems   at the top that the public has been more than privy to over the   past year, the company's momentum has been all but   derailed. Fortunately, there lies a strong case to be made   that the company's inherent advantages remain intact, and   brighter days lie ahead.Content is king!Viacom was built into what it is today by 93-year-old Sumner   Redstone, who built his empire on the belief that it was content,   not distribution, that would fuel the entertainment industry in   the decades ahead. When he made this shift, in the 1970s when he   was working for his father's National Amusements theater chain,   this was a novel innovation. Today, the world has caught onto   this insight and is giving the company a run for its money.   However, this should not detract from the company's prime   properties, networks like MTV (and its derivative channels), as   well as Nickelodeon, Comedy Central, Spike, BET, and CMT. On top   of all this, the company is also the owner of Paramount   Studios.Despite increasing competition from all quarters, Viacom's   networks are holding their own. For the quarter ended December   31, 2016, Media Networks' revenues rose 1% to $2.6 billion -- and   this ignores an averse 2% impact due to foreign exchange losses.   Softness in total advertising revenues (-2% to $1.29 billion) was   balanced out by an increase in affiliate (essentially   international) revenues, which climbed 2% to $1.14 billion. These   results are nothing to write home about, but they aren't   terrible, either. All the more, when looking at the situation   holistically and holding shares up to the light of its enviable   brands and good-not-great recent financial results, shares become   increasingly attractive when one reflects on their current   valuation.VIAB PE Ratio (TTM)data byYCharts.Should Viacom be able to right the ship, investors will more   than likely be handsomely rewarded given the stock's historically   low valuation. Here, the situation appears to be positive as   well. Management is no longer distracted by the drama surrounding   the departure of Sumner Redstone and will be able to focus on   international expansion of its brands. Also, Paramount Studios   has recently been given a ""booster shot"" of sorts via a$1 billion dollar, 3-year dealby Chinese film studios Shanghai Film Group and Huahua Media. The   cash infusion, coupled with the potential for allowing Paramount   to make strong inroads into the fast-growing Chinese film market   all bode well. These facts are perhaps why analysts polled byS&P Global Market Intelligencethink Viacom's EPS will likely grow from $3.85 per share in FY   2017 to a respectable $5.26 per share (an annualized 8%   annualized increase).A few words of cautionThe world continues to change, and while few could have   imagined Viacom's reach 30 years ago, the same could have been   said of potential threats to its core entertainment   brands. The fact is, the company faces threats from all   quarters, from individuals in their homes posting comedic videos   on YouTube to Time Warner'sHBO. Consumers only have so many hours in the day, and fantastic   content is now everywhere they turn. Viacom likely has what it   takes to continue to compete and garner viewers' eyeballs and   attention -- but the ever-present risk that the company will   slowly be overtaken is there.Foolish final thoughtsIt appears that now is a rare time to buy into a fantastic   media enterprise at a time when its shares are trading hands at a   historically low valuation. True, its competitive position isn't   what it used to be, and yes, the company has been mired in an   ugly battle for control that was only recently resolved. But   these negatives should not detract from the company's   one-of-a-kind media properties, nor its attractive valuation that   brings with it a 1.8% dividend yield to boot. Overall, Viacom's   shares are worthy of strong consideration by Foolish investors   with an eye to the future.Offer from The Motley Fool: The 10 best stocks to buy     nowMotley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more     than a decade beating the market.

5 Finalists for Google Lunar XPrize Race to the Moon;2/19/2017;"Only 46 weeks remain for one of five lucky companies to claim   a $20 million prize -- and the first one to arrive on the Moon   gets it.For the past 18 months, I've kept you up to date on the   loomingGoogle Lunar XPRIZE competition, a $40 million effort (recently increased from $30 million) --   sponsored byAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) and organized by Peter   Diamandis' nonprofit XPRIZE organization -- to encourage   private development of the Moon. But it's only now, this year,   that the clock really starts ticking. At some time within the   next 10 and a half months, one company must succeed in achieving   XPRIZE's three key stated requirements -- or forfeit its chance   to win the $20 million purse for placing first.Sometime in 2017, someone will land on the Moon. Bet on it.     Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();First thing's firstIn case youhaven'tbeen paying attention to the Google Lunar XPRIZE competition,   let's bring you up to date. So far, $5.25 million in prizes have   been doled out to teams demonstrating ""milestone"" capabilities in   the skills of conducting lunar landings, moving about on the   lunar surface, and lunar imaging.Still up for grabs is the grand prize -- $20 million for being   the first team to successfully land on the Moon, travel at least   500 meters from the landing site, and transmit two   high-definition ""Mooncasts"" back to Earth. The second team to   complete all three missions will receive $5 million, and then   there are up to $17 million in additional prizes for   accomplishing various add-on missions (e.g., conducting a   Mooncast from the Apollo 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, or 17 landing sites,   keeping a rover alive and functioning for at least two days, or   finding water on the Moon).But to win any share at all of this loot, someone has to land   on the Moon -- and someone has to be first.Round up some unusual suspectsWho will the winner be? I've already introduced you to two of   the leading contenders:Israeli start-up SpaceIL, which has contracted with     Spaceflight Industries for room aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket     to carry its spacecraft and lander to the Moon.And America's ownMoon Express, the first company to receive U.S. government approval to land     on the Moon (with a little help from Rocket Lab's Electron     rocket, which will be carrying it up there).Both these rivals have set launch dates vaguely in the ""late   2017"" range, ensuring this race will go down to the wire. As for   the other participants, last month, XPRIZE announced the   remaining three finalists ready to take a shot at the Moon. These   include:Synergy Moon, an international alliance among the Human     Synergy Project, California-based Interplanetary Ventures,     British satcom company RPC Telecommunications, and American     aerospace manufacturer Interorbital Systems. Interorbital will     provide the rocket for this team -- a NEPTUNE 8 launch vehicle     launching from sea, off the California coast, sometime later     this year.Team Indus, flying aboard an ISRO space agency     PSLV rocket from India before attempting to land an ""ECA""     moon rover.And finally, Japanese competitor Hakuto, an eclectic team     backed by everyone from Japanese space agency JAXA to Suzuki to     a rock band called ""Sakanaction.""Curiously, both Indus and Hakuto will ride the same PSLV   rocket to the Moon, and land their rovers on the same lander.   This could make it difficult deciding which one lands ""first"" and   gets the big $20 million prize. But seeing as they have to land   on the Moon successfully before they encounter this dilemma,   figuring out who arrived first will be a nice problem to have   once they get there. Indus and Hakuto plan to launch their XPRIZE   mission on Dec. 28, 2017.What it means to investors$20 million, $30 million, $40 million -- however much prize   money Google ultimately antes up for the winners, it's unlikely   thatanyof these teams will make much of a profit from running the first   privately funded Moon landing. But that's not the point.First and foremost, the point will be earning bragging rights   for accomplishing something no nongovernmental agency -- not even   SpaceX -- has ever done before: landing a spacecraft on the Moon.   And as we saw when privately held Scaled Composites won the   Ansari XPRIZE back in 2004 -- and was later bought out byNorthrop Grumman(NYSE: NOC) , which had previously owned only a minority stake --   just placing first in an XPRIZE competition could make a company   more attractive to would-be acquirers.Of greater import to investors, though, is what comesaftersomeone successfully lands a spacecraft on the Moon. Proving the   mission is feasible will almost certainly invite imitation by   larger companies, and with any luck, publicly traded companies   that we can invest in ourselves. It will open up not just a new   market, but literally a whole new world of opportunities for   those who follow the trail blazed by this year's space pioneers.   All we need now is for someone to take that first step.And by Dec. 31, 2017, we should know who that will be.10 stocks we like better than Northrop GrummanWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Are General Motors and Lyft About to Crush All Self-Driving Rivals?;2/19/2017;"General Motors(NYSE: GM) is planning to build and deploy thousands of   self-driving electric cars in test fleets with Lyft next year,   according to a newReutersreport.If that's for real, it will be by far the largest fleet of   autonomous test vehicles in operation. It's a very big deal that   has huge implications for GM, Lyft, and their   rivals.What the report saidAccording to the Reuters article, GM will build thousands of   Chevy Bolts equipped with prototype versions of the self-driving   system GM has developed with its subsidiary, Cruise Automation.   Most of these self-driving Bolts will go into ride-hailing   service with Lyft in several states starting sometime in   2018.makeArticleAd();GM has no plans right now to sell the self-driving Bolts to   the general public.CEO Mary Barra announced in December that GM would begin     producing self-driving Chevrolet Bolt test vehicles in early     2017. Image source: General Motors.What it would mean for GMGM has been working on self-driving technology for years. That   work seemed to take a big leap forward with the acquisition of   San Francisco-based start-up Cruise Automation early last year.   It appears that Cruise has since become the center of GM's   research efforts. Cruise's self-driving Chevy Bolt test cars have   become regular sights on San Francisco streets, and recent videos   taken from inside self-driving Bolt test cars suggest thatthe GM/Cruise technology is at a fairly advanced   level. GM announced in December that it would soon begin   producing self-driving Bolt test vehicles, but the hint was that   -- at least in the near term -- they'd be produced in   small quantities for GM's own testing.A mass deployment would demonstrate two things: First, that   GM's technology really is at a high level, and second, that GM   and its supplier partners are ready and able to mass-produce   self-driving cars.Both of those things are significant. Taken together, it would   be a strong argument that GM is leading the way to mass-produced   Level 4 self-driving vehicles. Companies likeAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) andTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) have attracted a lot of investor attention for   (among other things) their self-driving efforts, but --   as of right now, at least -- GM seems poised to leapfrog just   about everybody.What it would mean for LyftLyft, like its larger rival Uber Technologies, knows that   replacing its human drivers with self-driving vehicles is crucial   to its future. Autonomous ride-hailing vehicles will allow Lyft   to lower its prices while generating (hopefully) strong   profits.Uber has been working on its own self-driving technology for a   couple of years, and has a fewprototype self-driving test cars in servicenow. Lyft isn't known to have done any work on a self-driving   system of its own, but it doesn't need to: GMowns a 9% stakein Lyft, and GM seems to have it handled.If Lyft beats Uber to a self-driving fleet at scale, Uber will   have a big challenge on its hands.GM president Dan Ammann (center) with Lyft co-founders Logan     Green (left) and John Zimmer. GM owns 9% of the ride-hailing     company, and Ammann is a member of its board of directors.     Image source: General Motors.Could this be for real?The Reuters report, by veteran auto-business journalist Paul   Lienert, cites two unnamed ""sources familiar with the automaker's   plans."" Generally, investors (and everyone else) should take   reports based on information from unnamed sources with a grain or   two of salt. But a few things suggest to me that this is probably   for real.First, Lienert is a veteran with good sources, and Reuters   holds its reporting to high standards. Second, the report fits   with the known facts: GM and Lyft have both said that atest of autonomous GM vehicles in Lyft service is   forthcoming. Third, GM's Orion, Michigan, factory, where the Bolt is built,   has plenty of capacity to do a special production run in the   thousands.Finally, and most tellingly, neither Lyft nor GM denied the   report. In fact, GM's statement in response was almost a smiling   hint:We do not provide specific details on potential future     products or technology rollout plans. We have said that our AV     technology will appear in an on-demand ride sharing network     applicationsooner than you might think. [Emphasis added.]Translation: This is likely to happen, and it might begin   sooner than 2018.How important is this for GM investors?If it happens, it will be a big deal. While the idea of a   ""race"" to self-driving technologyisn't really useful to investors, a big test like this next year (or sooner) will show that GM   isn't about to be disrupted by Silicon Valley when it comes to   self-driving. It will also give lots of people an   opportunity to experience self-driving technology firsthand,   which will almost certainly speed its adoption by increasing   consumer demand.If nothing else, it seems very likely to attract investors'   attention and give GM shares a boost.10 stocks we like better than General MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Here   are some rules to help you build a bigger nest egg with an   IRA.What are IRAs?As a refresher, you can get big tax benefits by saving money   for retirement in a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA.In 2017, you can set aside up to $5,500 of your earnings in   either a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA or a combination of the   two. If you're 50 years old or older, then you can save up to   $6,500 of your earnings in an IRA.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Traditional IRAs can be funded with pre-tax money, which means   that money you put in now isn't taxed at your current tax rate.   Instead, that money, and any future gains, are taxed when its   withdrawn. Because of this feature, traditional IRAs can make   sense if you think your income tax rate in retirement will belowerthan it is today.Alternatively, Roth IRAs are funded with after-tax money,   which means you're paying taxes on your contributions now so that   you can withdraw them -- and future gains -- tax-free in   retirement. Because of up-front taxation, a Roth IRA can make   sense if you expect your income tax rate in retirement to behigherthan it is today.Some important IRA withdrawal rulesIn the case of a traditional IRA, if you don't wait until   you're at least 59.5 years old, the IRS will charge you income   taxes on any money that you withdraw, plus a 10% penalty, unless   you qualify for an early withdrawal exemption (more on that in a   minute).In the case of a Roth IRA, you can withdraw your contributions   tax-free at any age without a penalty, as long as the Roth IRA   has been established for at least five years. However, any gains   that you withdraw prior to reaching age 59.5 can be subject to   income tax and penalties.Both traditional IRAs and Roth IRAs do allow penalty free,   early withdrawals in specific instances. A full list of these   exemptions can be foundhere, but the big ones to know about include purchasing a first home   (up to $10,000), or payingcollege tuitionfor you, or an immediate relative, such as a spouse or child. The   rules for taking advantage of these exemptions can be quite   complex, so make sure you consult a tax professional before   taking any early withdrawals. After all, the last thing you want   is a surprise at tax time!Overall, a Roth IRA might be a better option if you think   you'll need to withdraw contributions five or more years from   now, and you won't be 59.5 years old or qualify for an early   withdrawal exemption at that time.Navigating the IRA income capsIn order to qualify for a tax deduction on a traditional IRA   contribution, your modified adjusted gross income has to be below   set limits if you, or your spouse, are covered by a retirement   plan at work. Similarly, in order to contribute to a Roth IRA,   your modified adjusted gross income needs to be below set limits   too.Recently, fellow Motley Fool Matthew Frankel did a great job   at explaining adjusted income limits for IRA'shere, but in short, if you're single and you are covered by a   retirement plan at work, you can take the full deduction on a   traditional IRA contribution if your adjusted income is below   $62,000 in 2017. You can qualify for a partial deduction if your   adjusted income is between $62,000 and $72,000.If you're single, you can make a contribution to a Roth IRA as   long as your adjusted income is less than $118,000. You can make   a partial contribution if your adjusted income is between   $118,000 and $133,000.If you're married filing jointly and covered by a retirement   plan at work, then you can take a tax deduction on your   traditional IRA contribution, as long as your adjusted income is   below $99,000. A partial deduction is possible if your adjusted   income is between $99,000 and $119,000.If you're not covered by a plan at work but your spouse is,   then you can make a tax deductible contribution to traditional   IRA if your adjusted income is below $186,000 or a partial   deduction if your adjusted income is between $186,000 and   $196,000.If you're married filing jointly, you can contribute to a Roth   IRA as long as your adjusted income is below $184,000. A partial   contribution can be made if your income is between $184,000 and   $194,000.If you think you're close to these limits and you're unsure of   how to calculate your modified adjusted gross income, you can   read up on the subjecthere.How to invest in an IRAOnce you've contributed to an IRA, you'll need to pick some   investments. There are a lot of choices, and you'll want to think   carefully about your age, your health, and the number of years   you have until you begin withdrawals.If you're young, in good health, and have plenty of years to   ride out the inevitable recession, then an IRA that includes   stocks, stock ETFs, and stock mutual funds can make sense.   Usually, buying and holding stocks and ETFs for long periods of   time is cheaper than buying an actively managed mutual fund, so   make sure that you balance the potential return, risk, and   expenses associated with these choices.Some investors may prefer owning individual stocks for the   long term, such as disruptive growth companies likeAmazonorAlphabet. Other investors may prefer owning an S&P 500 ETF that   tracks the stock market's returns more closely. If so, a low-cost   S&P 500 ETF that might fit the bill is theVanguardS&P 500 ETF(NYSEMKT: VOO) . It has an annual expense ratio of just   0.05%.It may also pay off to own dividend-paying stocks in an IRA.   Because IRAs offer tax advantages, dividend payments can compound   over time tax-deferred, or in the case of a Roth IRA, potentially   tax-free. Historically, dividend-paying stocks have outperformed   non-dividend-paying stocks. However, the performance ofdividend   stockstends to be lower during periods of rising interest rates, when   they have to compete with bonds for income investors'   attention.Overall, building a diversified IRA that includes exposure to   stocks and stock ETFs can provide financial security in   retirement. For example, if you're 30, and you contribute $5,500   per year for 35 years and earn a hypothetical 6% return per year,   then you'll have a nest egg valued at $612,886 at age 65. That's   not chump change, so make sure that you take advantage of this   powerful savings tool.The $16,122 Social Security bonus most retirees   completely overlookIf you're like most Americans, you're a few years (or more)   behind on your retirement savings. But a handful of little-known   ""Social Security secrets"" could help ensure a boost in your   retirement income. For example: one easy trick could pay you as   much as $16,122 more... each year!

VMware, Inc. (VMW) Keeps the Momentum Going;2/17/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsVMware, Inc.(NYSE:VMW) may not be one of the first companies that comes to mind when you're thinking about cloud services stocks. But, it should be.makeArticleAd();Source:FlickrBelieve it or not, VMW is one of the top enterprise cloud services and virtualization companies out there. And, its growth up to now, while impressive, is just the beginning. In the past 12 months, VMW stock has almost doubled.That sounds compelling, but the underlying story is what makes VMW's rise something you should understand, especially if you're looking for exposure in this massively disruptive market.Simply put, cloud computing means that your computer doesn't need to have individual software packages for each specific job you want it to do. In the old days, you ran a word processing program, a spreadsheet program, a design program, etc. And, every machine had to have its individual software suite.The rise of networked computers meant that all of this software could be stored on a network ""library"" and each user could access what they needed.7 Tech Stocks That Could Implode at Any MinuteThe next iteration of these networks were housed in the ""cloud,"" which simply implies a virtual space built into servers. One of the primary advantages is the ability to access your information from the cloud, regardless of where you are or what computer you're using.Cloud computing has been around for a long time, and companies such asAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL),Microsoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT),Oracle Corporation(NYSE:ORCL) andAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) have been using the cloud for many years.Now, companies of all sizes are migrating to the cloud, and within the cloud universe there both public clouds (where many people have access) and private clouds (where only select people have access). VMW provides the ability to develop each of these systems, and also facilitates unique access between public and private clouds.Why Don't We Hear Much About VMware?VMWare is actually owned byDell Technologies Inc(NYSE:DVMT) subsidiary,EMC Corporation(NYSE:EMC). Last April, Dell bought EMC to become the largest privately-held tech company in the world. So, VMWare is a cloud-based, publicly-traded branch of this major tech player now.Part of the reason you don't hear about VMWare as much as its competitors is because the company's relationship to its owners is a bit convoluted, and analysts aren't very confident in figuring out how to value VMW stock. Their loss is your gain.3 Stocks to Buy for Under $10 With 25%-Plus UpsideQ4 and full-year numbers were posted in late January, and they show how strong VMW stock remains. Earnings beat analyst expectations and revenue continued to grow at a solid clip. A new strategic partnership with AMZN's cloud-computing juggernaut, Amazon Web Services (AWS), adds some serious firepower to the VMW arsenal. It also helps the company remain competitive in a very dynamic field.When you have a tech parent like EMC and a tech partner like AWS, you are doing very well. These brands are major players in the enterprise sector and will open even more doors for VMW in the future. VMWare stock is on a significant growth trajectory that should last years, not months.Louis Navellieris a renowned growth investor.

Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Stock: The Pause That Refreshes;2/17/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsNvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA) is all about visual computing.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockThe company started as a high-end graphics card maker for users who were interested in having the best display quality you could get. That ranged from online gamers to research scientists.Given that chip and card makers aren't exactly in short supply, few investors gave this niche player much time. The thought was, NVDA may have a great graphics card, but it's a ""nice to have,"" not a ""need to have"" kind of product.What's more, most chipmakers had perfectly serviceable graphics cards. Why contract out to yet another vendor when you already had a chipmaker that could provide you with a decent graphics card?Those Days Are Gone NowQuality graphics are no longer just a nice add on; they're crucial now that processing speeds have soared and new technologies have been able to thrive. In this visual computing space, Big Data, virtual reality (VR) and the Internet of Things (IoT) are three major disruptive forces that lean heavily on quality rendering and fast processing.7 Tech Stocks That Could Implode at Any MinuteSimply put, Big Data packages large data sets and then analyzes them to find any discernible patterns or trends. For example, a store can figure out what day and time is best for 30-something women to buy a shirt. Visualizing these data sets is very helpful in analyzing this process.VR and its cousin, augmented reality (AR), are not only the hottest technologies in gaming, but are already revolutionizing other fields where interaction is highly prized. For example, medical schools are using AR tech to virtually operate on an augmented cadaver, rather than physically operating on one. The possibilities are just being tapped at this point.IoT is another technology in its infancy. As artificial intelligence and bandwidth merge, opportunities are appearing everywhere, for instance in ""smart"" cars, homes, offices, you name it. One of the best examples nowadays isAmazon.com, Inc's(NASDAQ:AMZN) Alexa orAlphabet Inc's(NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Home device, where you can do everything from order a pizza to set your thermostat just by talking to the thing. It recognizes your commands and then, through its connectivity, turns your request into reality.NVDA is already working with many major car companies to create the next-generation car dashboard, as well as other interactive possibilities. It is helping scientists manipulate molecules and atoms to build better drugs. And, it's building the chips that are featured in the newest gaming system fromNintendo Co., Ltd (ADR)(OTCMKTS:NTDOY).These are just a few reasons that NVDA is up 282% in the past 12 months.7 Dividend Stocks for the Retirement You DeservePart of this big move was because the entire semiconductor industry was weak because demand had slackened. But, this is a cyclical industry and it's ""game on"" once again. Plus, NVDA has shown that it's more than just a graphics card maker at this point. It is on the leading edge of the next generation of visual computing.NVDA numbers for Q4 were recently released, and the stock came down from its 52-week highs on the news.But, this is simply the pause that refreshes. The numbers were still impressive and there is significant untapped growth for NVDA stock. Management's guidance may have been slightly conservative, but it's likely that stellar growth will remain in Nvidia's future for many years to come.Louis Navellieris a renowned growth investor.

Apple to Begin Assembling iPhone SE in India from April;2/17/2017;"makeZacksArticleAd();Reportedly,Apple Inc.AAPLin collaboration with its manufacturer, Wistron Inc. will begin to assemble iPhone SE in India starting this April. The plant will be located in the state of Karnataka in south India.Though there is no official word on the matter from Apple or Wistron, it has been reported that initially the Cupertino giant wants to assemble 0.3-0.4 million units of iPhone SE. Apple hasn't even waited for the numerous tax concessions that it sought from the India government including the 15-year customs duty holiday.Analysts observe that it was prudent on part of Apple to begin assembling its most economic iPhone offering, SE, which was launched to cater to cost sensitive markets like India. Plus, it also will support future iOS upgrades unlike iPhone 5S, which will soon be discontinued in most of the markets including India.Apple Inc. PriceApple Inc. Price|Apple Inc. QuoteWhy is Apple Keen on India?Since the last year, Apple has been increasing its focus on India to claim a greater share of the vast smartphone market, of which it reportedly holds only 2% as of now. Apple faces slowing iPhone demand in most of the regions, either because of competition or regulatory hurdles (China) or market saturation (the U.S). Therefore, it makes sense for the company to solidify its position in India, which is projected to become the second largest smartphone market in the world. In fiscal 2016, Apple sales in India grew approximately 50% over the prior fiscal.Furthermore, a younger (and skilled) population and increasing investment in broadband network by the government also make India an attractive growth opportunity for Apple over the long run. In fact, the government under PM Narendra Modi is eager to bring foreign capital and boost manufacturing facilities in India.The recently outlined FDI policy also bodes well for the company as it eliminates the requirement to locally source products for at least a three-year period. This will enable Apple to open its solely-owned retails stores in India. Thereafter, the company will have to comply with the rule. The company has also partnered with telecom company Reliance, which is providing its Jio (a unique all-IP network) service for free with the new iPhones.Last year, Tim Cook was on a charm offensive in India. Besides meeting Modi, he also announced the opening of an iOS App Design and Development Accelerator in Bengaluru and a map development office in another southern Indian city, Hyderabad in collaboration with regional firm RMSI.ChallengesThe market is highly cost sensitive. Reportedly, majority of the smartphones sold are priced around INR 10K (roughly $145). iPhone 7 on the other hand costs almost five times more. Even iPhone SE is priced at INR 30K. The lion's share of Apple's revenues in the country comes from devices, which are a couple of generations old. Newer models have relatively low demand given the hefty price tag.  A few days back, it was reported that the Apple team in India is trying to increase revenues to $3 billion by 2017-18 and by local assembling operations, the company can start to operate its own retail outlets and avail a 10% tax benefit. This should lower prices.Plus, Apple's rival Samsung along with a few Chinese smartphone makers dominates this market. Samsung has long been in the market and with reportedly 23% share, it is a leading player in the country. Apple is quite late to the party.Also, Apple's lack of focus on regional customers' demand is a concern. India is categorized by handsets that work on dual SIMs. Apparently, Apple is not keen on making dual SIM handsets. This could be a very big impediment to growth in the country.Also, analysts observe that Apple is ""relocating"" manufacturing to India from China, given rising labor costs. However another analyst argues that though labor is cheap compared with China, productivity is relatively better in China. Simple assembling may not drastically bring down prices. However, the creation of a local supply chain as in China will be a big positive.Despite the pros and cons, Apple is expected to continue its India drive. It will be taking up a lot more initiatives this year. However, whether those initiatives yield desirable results remains a watch and see story.Apple, of course, is not the only tech player eyeing India for growth. Given the potential of this market, Silicon Valley's interest is well understood. From Microsoft Corp.MSFTto AlphabetGOOGLto Facebook Inc.FBall remain laser focused on the market.Zacks Rank & Price MovementAt present, Apple has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Heading to $160 on Video Capabilities;2/17/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMaking excuses to not likeFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) and avoiding FB stock is just plain dumb. Ahead of the company's fourth-quarter earnings report, I gave FB stock a Strong Buy rating with a 12-monthprice target of $150. With the earnings report now in behind us, I'm inclined to raise that target to $160.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockIndeed, FB stock is no bargain when shares are near all-time highs, but the company's revenue growth engines are certain to significantly impact the bottom line. Although management didn't scale back on plans to increase capital spending, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who said the social media giant was aiming for shorter-form content, has made clear that FB intends to dominate video, which is where the bulk of its capex will go.And, that spending has already begun.Why Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock Could Fly to $1,000 in 2017Last week Facebook hired Mina Lefevre, former head of scripted development atViacom, Inc.(NASDAQ:VIA). This hire can only be for one reason: to increase Facebook's transition toward developing original content. Contrary to popular opinion, Zuckerberg is not pushing Facebook to become a television network, nor does he envision the company competing withNetflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX). His drive to become a ""video-first"" company has everything to do with selling more ads.From my vantage point, the reason Facebook must spend money is because it has begun to experience a problem thatTwitter Inc(NYSE:TWTR) craves: It has run out of ad space on its news feeds. But, Facebook doesn't want to sacrifice the user experience without first knowing what sorts of videos users will want to see - and how to make them less intrusive.To that end, Lefevre, whose track record at Viacom-owned MTV Networks includes producing teen-focused content, is a solid hire. To the extent Facebook's shorter-form content can put it into the realm ofAlphabet Inc's(NASDAQ:GOOGL) advertising juggernaut YouTube, it would have been money well spent.7 Stocks to Sell or Short Before the Bears StrikeIn that regard, given Zuckerberg's Midas-like qualities, it would be a mistake to avoid FB stock solely on the fears of high capex. It would make more sense to focus on the return Facebook can realize from its investments.Bottom Line for FB StockFacebook - as it promised in the third quarter - has signaled that it will be in a period of transition.

Referred to as government money market funds, funds in that group are generally exempt from the gates-and-fees requirement. In turn, that makes them popular with investors who do not want their ability to exit the fund to be limited or subject to penalty fees.RELATED:Are Fidelity's Recent Stock Buys And Sells Retirement Account Hot Sauce?Vanguard Net Fund Inflow Dwarfed Its Peers' In 2016Vanguard Drew The Lion's Share Of 2016's Mutual Fund Net Inflow"

Facebook Inc (FB) Is Losing the War Against Fake News;2/16/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) has begun fighting a war against fake news and, so far at least, it's losing. Failure could have profound implications for Facebook's bottom line, and even threaten its ability to remain in business.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');Source: ShutterstockThe threat is deeper than Donald Trump. The power of Facebook's software tools, and communication capabilities, is a two-way street that benefits the darker side of human nature, as well as its better angels.For example, Facebook's Graph Search tool, introduced in 2013, can help you search the site efficiently. It can also help youstalk someone.Facebook Live, which lets users stream live video on the site from their camera phones, can let you show grandparents your kid's birthday party, as it happens. It can also let youshow the child being killed.CEO Mark Zuckerberg promised to do something about this in November, on his own Facebook page, but has not come out with much useful beyond tags on disputed items and a vague statement from an underling thatsharing fake news is your prerogative.FB stock holders need to be worried.Facebook Is a Media Company, Like It or NotFacebook has continually denied it is a media company, subject to responsibility for what it posts, fearing the need in that case for human interventionthat simply would not scale.7 Stocks Warren Buffett Is Buying or SellingThe latest statement from its vice president for partnerships, Dan Rose, is that Facebook is""a new type of platform …where people discovery a lot of media content.""That's about as mealy-mouthed as anything that could come from a corrupt politician.For FB, however, fake news is a global problem, and most countries don't have regulations separating a ""telecommunications service"" from the responsibilities of a ""media outlet."" Thus, Facebook's efforts at self-censorship are showing up first in international markets.The European Commission, for instance, has already warned Facebook, and other networks, thatthey face legal actionif the issue of fake news is not dealt with. AlongsideAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL), Facebook is testing a system calledCrossCheckfor flagging fake news in France, which holds a presidential election this spring.This is being done in cooperation with local media, but the reporting on it shows the difficulty.A Russian storyon the system calls the problem ""so-called fake news"" and calls CrossCheck a plot by the ""mainstream media.""Germany, which holds its own elections this September, is also threatening to imposea 500,000-euro finefor each fake news story it runs.How Bad Can It Get?To see how bad things can get with fake news and the abuse of Facebook Live, Zuckerberg might look at South Sudan, where expatriates are turning a civil conflict into genocide with social media messages or the Dominican Republic, where two journalists were recently killed on Facebook Live as a message from crime gangs.Apple Inc. (AAPL) Careens Closer to Major AR AnnouncementA recent Pew Research study showed 44% of Americans get their news through Facebook, and that most users get news from only one site, meaning Facebook has political and media power commensurate with its financial power.That power: fourth-quarter revenue of $8.8 billion, with $4.27 billion going to net income. FB stock has no debt but nearly $30 billion in cash on the books, supporting a market cap of $385 billion - almost twice that ofWal-Mart Stores Inc.(NYSE:WMT).All this is severely threatened if Facebook can't get its arms around the problem of lies and abuse.Real lives are on the line, not just cyber lives.

Would You Ditch Your Home Phone for Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN)?;2/16/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsRoughly half of American homes no longer have an old-school telephone, relying instead on cell phones and smartphones. IfAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) andAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL) have their way, home phones could become even more of a rarity.makeArticleAd();Source: AmazonA report inTheWall Street Journalsuggests the companies are working on adding voice-calling capabilities to the Amazon Echo and Google Home smart speakers.The Plan to Make Amazon Echo Your New TelephoneTheWall Street Journalis reporting that Google and Amazon are looking at an all-new use for their smart speakers:replacing the home telephone.The idea makes sense. Telephones increasingly seem like outdated technology. Between smartphones and PC-based calling services likeMicrosoft Corporation's(NASDAQ:MSFT) Skype, the days of the dedicated home phone seem numbered. In 2015, a survey by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (which, apparently, cares about these things) found thatnearly half of American homes had given up their dedicated landline.But, that still leaves a lot of telephones in operation.Apparently, it's occurred to both Amazon and Google that smart speakers such as the Amazon Echo and Google Home may be the right device in the right place at the right time. Smart speakers get the name because they leverage an AI-powered personal digital assistant.Why Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock Could Fly to $1,000 in 2017Amazon's Echo is home to Alexa, withover 5,000 skills. These devices have the smarts to take on telephone functionality. They could incorporate Skype, for example. And, Google has a slew of its own telephony applications it could leverage, including Google Voice and Duo.The Amazon Echo and Google Home are equipped with excellent microphones, they have speakers, they are always connected (to the internet) and they respond instantly to voice commands, even from across a room.So, as long as privacy isn't an issue (since using one would be like using a speakerphone), a smart speaker could replace a telephoneandsave consumers money by eliminating the monthly cost of a landline. While this would be a potentially useful trick for existing smart speaker owners, it's the kind of practical capability that could drive sales among those consumers who wouldn't otherwise consider a high-tech device like the Amazon Echo.The Challenges of Turning a Smart Speaker Into a TelephoneWhile the technology and built-in smarts may be there, in reality turning that Amazon Echo on your kitchen counter into your home phone may not be quite that simple.TheWall Street Journalarticle lays out some of the challenges. For example, there are potential privacy issues, not only in speaking out loud to the Echo (it lacks an AUX input, so you couldn't physically connect a handset), but the fact that now your telephone would always be listening to you and recording key data like phone numbers and call durations.Amazon and Google would also have to implement a feature to prevent voice commands from being triggered during a phone conversation.It's also been pointed out that switching from a cell phone or landline to an internet-based telephone service has implications for emergency services. For example, theFCC lists a series of limitations to 911 servicewhen home owners rely on internet-based (or VoIP) services.Calls may not be routed directly to an emergency center, locational information may not be available to emergency responders and, in a power outage, internet telephones go offline without battery backups.7 Tech Stocks That Could Implode at Any MinuteDespite the challenges,The Wall Street Journalsays its sources are convinced Amazon and Google will move forward, calling the move to telephone capability ""the logical next step for the artificial intelligence-powered speakers."" And, that move could happen later this year.The question is, knowing that there are some privacy concerns and potential safety issues in doing so, would you ditch your landline and use an Amazon Echo as your home's new telephone?As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace7 Stocks to Sell or Short Before the Bears StrikeBank of America Corp (BAC) Stock Is Going to $30 This Year7 Stocks Warren Buffett Is Buying or SellingThe postWould You Ditch Your Home Phone for Amazon.com, Inc.

Apple Inc. (AAPL) Careens Closer to Major AR Announcement;2/16/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) CEO Tim Cook has been talking an awful lot lately about augmented reality - or AR. The latest episode was last week, when hecompared the technology to the iPhonein terms of its potential to be big.makeArticleAd();Source: NanticAfter months of repeatedly playing up AR in public, it's beginning to feel as if Cook is setting the expectations of the press and public about the technology.That begs the question: Is Apple Inc. planning a major augmented reality announcement?AR vs. VR: What's the Difference?Augmented reality is related to virtual reality - or VR - but the two are also very different.Virtual reality uses technology to completely immerse people in a virtual world. This requires powerful computing hardware and special headgear. VR has spent several years as the next big thing, culminating withFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) buying VR pioneer Oculus for $2 billion in 2014.Virtual reality hasn't quite caught on in a big way - the expensive and awkward equipment is a big hurdle to overcome - but gamers have begun embracing it.7 Stocks Warren Buffett Is Buying or SellingSo far, Apple has shown no interest in virtual reality and Tim Cook has actually made a point in several interviews of downplaying VR. In the latest, when Cook spoke toThe Independent, he laments the fact that virtual reality""closes the world out.""""Most people don't want to lock themselves out from the world for a long period of time and today you can't do that because you get sick from it.""The antisocial aspects of virtual reality, the equipment requirements and side effects such as motion sickness have been common themes in Cook's argument against virtual reality.However, he is very excited by augmented reality and its ability to go mainstream. Instead of locking a person into a virtual world, AR overlays the existing world with additional information. One of the most popular examples of AR in action is the gamePokemon Go, released last summer. That game was themost downloaded app of 2016on Apple Inc.'s App Store.Is Apple Inc. Planning a Major AR Announcement?Tim Cook's views on augmented reality seem to have been getting more positive in the past few months, reaching the point where he's actively hyping the technology.In October, he said:""I do think that a significant portion of the population of developed countries, and eventually all countries, will have AR experiences every day, almost like eating three meals a day. It will become that much a part of you.""And last week, he toldThe Independent:""I regard it as a big idea like the smartphone. The smartphone is for everyone, we don't have to think the iPhone is about a certain demographic, or country or vertical market: it's for everyone. I think AR is that big, it's huge.""What's holding AR back is the technology.Hardware doesn't need to be as powerful as the silicon needed to drive virtual reality gear. And rather than a fully enclosed headpiece or goggles - that themselves are so complex they can cost $600 on top of the PC needed to drive them - augmented reality can be delivered through specialized eyeglasses or on a smartphone's display. The problem is current efforts haven't been quite good enough.Alphabet Inc's(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) failed Google Glass is the best-known example of the AR overlay glasses model, whilePokemon Goshows the relatively primitive AR experience that current smartphones can deliver.What if Tim Cook has been playing up augmented reality (and dissing VR) because Apple Inc. is preparing to make a major push into AR? It could be the company that takes augmented reality mainstream by nailing the hardware, while everyone else is distracted by trying to get consumers to buy into VR.There has been speculation that Apple is working with German optics firmCarl Zeiss AGonApple-branded AR glasses. The iPhone 8 could also incorporate next generation hardware - from cameras to CPU and GPU - that are optimized to make AR a killer feature.Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock Could Win Big With 'Windows Cloud'We'll have to wait until the company is ready to show its hand to know exactly what is up. But based on Tim Cook's continued promotion of the technology, it seems likely that Apple Inc. is priming us for AR-related announcement.And if Cook is even close to being right about augmented reality having the potential to be as big as the iPhone, the upside for Apple stock could be huge.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace7 Stocks to Sell or Short Before the Bears Strike3 Tire Stocks That Are Burning Rubber in ChinaThe postApple Inc.

It's up 2,670% in that time, and it has been paying dividends in a rising stream since 2003. Payouts started at 20 cents per share and now bring in $2.50 each quarter.

BlackRock did not participate in the ""dot-bomb,"" the collapse of Internet stocks that began in early 2000 afterTime Warner Inc(NYSE:TWX) gave AOL 60% of its equity in a merger. BlackRock doubled in value that year.If you start calculating after the dot-bomb wreckage cleared, BlackRock is up ""only"" 1,000%, against a nearly 5,400% gain for Amazon during that time.Alphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL) has also outpaced it since going public in 2004.The point is that with few exceptions, like the 2008 stock market collapse, the value of BLK stock has consistently increased. And, even during that crisis - where its market cap was cut in half and other companies collapsed completely - BlackRock did not cut that dividend.America's Best Banker?CEO and co-founder Larry Fink is not often mentioned in the same breath as bankers like Jamie Dimon ofJPMorgan Chase & Co.(NYSE:JPM) or Lloyd Blankfein ofGoldman Sachs Group Inc(NYSE:GS); he just does better for his investors.7 Dividend Stocks for the Retirement You DeserveBlackRock wasfounded in 1988with operating capital from Pete Peterson of the Blackstone Group, from which it separated in 1995 after a dispute withStephen Schwarzmann, orchestrated withPNC Financial Services Group Inc(NYSE:PNC), whose investment arm came into BlackRock in 1998. BLK went public a year later at $14 per share.Since then, Fink has gone from strength to strength. BlackRock was hired to clean up the mess of the 2008 meltdown. BlackRock Solutions unwound the toxic mortgage assets. Plus, the same year it was hired for that job (2009), BlackRock acquired Barclays Global Investors and its iShares franchise.BlackRock's tech assets include Aladdin, an investment system from BlackRock Solutions, andiRetire, a retirement investment framework offered by other financial advisors.Hedge in the Age of TrumpAs BlackRock has grown, it has developed a knack for taking deals others wouldn't even consider - and making them work.Right now, for instance, BlackRock is spending $500 million renovating the Willis (nee Sears) Tower in Chicago. In 2015, BLK bought the 108-story landmark, the world's tallest building when completed in 1973, for $1.3 billion.For BlackRock, that's a small deal, actually. It's currently buying First Reserve Energy Infrastructure Funds, a $3.7 billion owner of income-producing energy projects like mid-stream pipelines, grabbing for Trump's infrastructure moneywith both hands.Fink is skeptical of the Trump rally, and of the President's plans for the dollar. Fink still loves the Mexican peso and is worried about the future of the global economy in the age of Trump. But, BlackRock keeps politics and business separate, its response to the travel ban mainly a letter to employees.BlackRock's ETF business hasmore than $1 trillion in assets.It considers Russia a buy, but is skeptical of Brexit, even while former UK Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne joins BLK as an adviser.Trade Apple, Inc. or Own It? I Have the Answer!During the fourth quarter of 2016, BlackRock againbeat analyst estimates, earning $852 million, $5.14 per share, on revenue of $2.89 billion. It brought approximately one-third of revenue to the net income line because most of its money came in the form of investment advisory fees, from administration fees and securities lending.Bottom Line for BlackRock StockWhen BlackRock plunges into a stock, it can hold up, despite real business pressures. An example isGoPro Inc(NASDAQ:GPRO) - without BlackRock's investment, the company might be worthless now. Similarly, BLK's growing investment inFirst Data Corp(NYSE:FDC), the transaction processing company,also made headlines.BlackRock operates passively, and its growth - considering the sheer size of its investment portfolio -concerns some reporters and regulators.Don't let yourself be counted among them. This is one of those stocks which, likeApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL), you can buy, put away and generally ignore, while still remaining confident of solid returns. BLK stock has a 20-year track record of stellar performance, and the founders remain at their desks.Dana Blankenhornis a financial and technology journalist.

Trade Apple, Inc. or Own It? I Have the Answer!;2/16/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWe've all heard the argument that it's wrong to tradeApple, Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL). Many prominent experts rage over those who dare to trade around the price action of AAPL stock. It is confusing to investors to figure out who is wrong. Sure, I could spend a few hours parsing data and calculating returns while making assumptions of entry and exit spots. Or, I can accept the fact that they are both right to a degree.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockOn the one hand, it is undeniable that owning Apple stock for decades has been a winning proposition. But so was trading around the chop. It comes down to what works for each us individually. Most investors enter positions but get stopped out when things go wrong. So I will refrain from judging which group is smarter.I found neutral ground using AAPL options. I commit to Apple long-term, especially when it falls out of favor, and leave myself room for error. I do so with no money out of pocket, thereby rendering my risk to a fraction of owning the stock.Last month, I created $5 per contract out of thin air trading AAPL stock when ithad appeared to be too late. Even more recently, I repeated for another $1.2 yield in mere days.This strategy is easy to do on equities that are solid and what some would consider sure things like AAPL orAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL). I am less easy about doing this with sayNetflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX). With stocks that are perceived to be risky,such as Netflix, I would need to be pickier with my entry and exit points.Today, I want to repeat performance regardless of which whale bought Apple or who sold it.How to Trade AAPL Stock HereThe Trade - Long AAPL:Sell the AAPL 2018 $105 put for $2.70 to open. The 22% price buffer from current levels translate into a 90% theoretical chance of success. I only sell naked puts if I am willing and able to own AAPL stock at the strike sold. Some investors prefer spreading the risk into a credit put spread instead, and that works too.7 Stocks Warren Buffett Is Buying or SellingClick to EnlargeI have been a longtime harsh critic of Tim Cook, so I don't count myself as an AAPL bull, but I do know how to do math. Apple's valuation makes sense at $100 or even $200 per share given current conditions. So I do trust selling risk against that fact rather than chase hope that Tim Cook is able to grow the company.For now, he has a boulder that is hard to stop, and I can count on buyers to support the price.I realize that markets are at all-time highs and precariously perched. So I could buy sacrifice puts in AAPL stock to guard against a market crash. For example, I could spend 20 cents buying the AAPL Jun $100 put to limit my loss if we fall off a cliff in the next four months.I am not required to hold my trades through expiration. I can close it for partial gains or losses at any time.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director ofSellSpreads.com.

TripAdvisor (TRIP) Q4 Earnings & Revenues Miss Estimates;2/16/2017;"TripAdvisor Inc.TRIPreported adjusted fourth-quarter 2016 earnings of 5 cents per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 13 cents. Adjusted earnings exclude one-time items but include stock-based compensation expense.The decrease was due to lower display advertising and subscription revenues. Management stated that the instant booking rollout led to significant revenue headwinds in 2016, muting revenue growth, thereby impacting profitability.Shares of the online travel research company were down more than 5% in response to the weak fourth-quarter results.Over the past one year, shares of TripAdvisor underperformed the Zacks categorized Electronic Commerce industry. While the industry gained 50.25%, the stock incurred a loss of 20.56%.RevenuesTripAdvisor reported revenues of $316.0 million in the fourth quarter, down 24.9% sequentially but up 2.3% year over year. The sequential decrease was due to some softness in display and subscription revenues. Also, revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $326 million.Earlier, TripAdvisor had changed its reportable segments to reflect changes in management's reporting structure. The new segments are Hotel and Other.Revenues of $252.0 million from theHotelsegment were down 21% sequentially and 3% from the year-ago quarter but made up 80% of total revenue. This segment includes click, display, subscription and transaction-based revenues from hotels, air and cruise, including that from the company's largest subsidiary, SmarterTravel, as well as from operations in China.Revenues of $64.0 million from theOthersegment decreased 37% sequentially but increased 31% year over year and contributed the remaining 20% of the total revenue. This segment includes revenues from attractions, restaurants and vacation rentals businesses.Revenues by SourceRevenues of $154.0 million from Click-based advertising were flat from the year-ago quarter and accounted for 49% of total revenue. Revenues from Display-based advertising decreased 3% year over year to $69.0 million and brought home 22% of total revenue. The other hotel revenue component was $29 million, down 17% year over year and accounted for 9% of total revenue. Non-Hotel revenue component contributed the remaining 20%, accounting for $64 million in revenues, up 31% year over year.Operating ResultsTripAdvisor's adjusted operating expenses of $290 million decreased 13.7% sequentially and 9.9% year over year. The adjusted operating margin of 5.7% was down significantly on a sequential as well as year-over-year basis.On a GAAP basis, TripAdvisor recorded a net profit of $1 million or 1 cent per share, down from the year-ago figure of $3 million or 2 cents.Pro forma earnings fell to 5 cents per share from 36 cents in fourth-quarter 2016Balance Sheet & Cash FlowTripAdvisor exited the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of roughly $730.0 million, slightly up from $727 million in the prior quarter. Accounts receivables were $189 million, down from $221 million in the last quarter.Long-term debt was $91 million in the fourth quarter compared with $20 million in the previous quarter.Cash flow from operations was $46.million, significantly up from ($87) million in the previous quarter. Capex was $16 million, down from $21 million in the third quarter. Free cash flow was $30 million, significantly up from ($108) million in the previous quarter.During the quarter, the company repurchased 1,651,957 shares for approximately $84 million. The share repurchase program authorized by the Board of Directors in February 2013 has been completed.Our TakeTripAdvisor is an online travel research company that features reviews and advice on hotels, resorts, flights, vacation rentals, vacation packages and travel guides, to name a few. The company reported a weak fourth quarter with both the top line and the bottom line missing our estimates.The company's solid fundamentals, growth initiatives, partnerships to boost hotel bookings, strong focus on developing its mobile products, expansion into the international restaurant reservation space and improvement in user growth and engagement, especially related to mobile devices will help the company achieve desired results.Additionally, TripAdvisor's acquisitions complement its travel product portfolio. These also improve efficiency and expand user base, on the one hand, while increasing traffic, hotel shoppers and profits, on the other. Over the long term, the company is well positioned to grow, given its expanding user base, improving margins and increasing monetization of social and mobile platforms.However, mounting expenses due to new initiatives and investments are hurting the company's profits. Also, lack of visibility and intensifying competition from PricelinePCLN, ExpediaEXPEand AlphabetGOOGLremain the future growth concerns.TripAdvisor, Inc.

Get a Free Refill on Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM);2/15/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsLast fall whenExxon Mobil Corporation(NYSE:XOM) fell hard, I wrote onhow to catch a falling machete. The trade was profitable and I have since booked it. On this dip, I want to reload the same setup for the opportunity for more profits.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockI am not one who likes to reinvent the wheel, so I will retrace my steps almost exactly from the last time I traded XOM stock.Since my last trade, oil prices overcame the $50 crude oil resistance price and established it as support. But they still haven't lived up to the entire upside measured move that should have taken out $58 per barrel. So crude oil prices are now stuck in a range.One major development since last fall is that OPEC is now committed to defending energy prices, so I don't anticipate oil falling too far. Consequently, I view any weakness in XOM stock as temporary and that buyers will step in to defend XOM stock.7 Tech Stocks That Could Implode at Any MinuteClick to EnlargeFundamentally, XOM andChevron Corporation(NYSE:CVX) are giants with little worry over their viability. However, technically XOM is at a must-bounce level. Else, and if it loses current levels, it could invite more technical sellers and retest $79 per share.This is not a forecast, but I do have to acknowledge it as a possibility.XOM Stock Trade IdeaThe Trade - Long XOM:Sell Jan 2018 $65 put. For this I collect $1.5 per contract to open. I only sell naked puts if I am willing and able to own the stock at the strike sold. I need XOM stock to stay above my strike sold. I have a 90% theoretical chance of success with this 21% buffer from current price. My breakeven price is $63.50 per share.I chose $65 per share because it gives me room for error and it puts my risk below recent lows.Selling naked puts is not appropriate for all investors. Luckily, I can modify the trade to better suit more conservative risk tastes.The Alternate Trade - Less Aggressively Long XOM:Sell the Jan 2018 $70/$67.50 credit put spread. This is a bullish trade for which I collected 40 cents per contract to open. I have a 95% theoretical chance of success to yield 17%. I have to note that the tradeoff for having a limited loss, this trade has a slightly smaller price buffer from current levels.Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Holders Shouldn't Worry About OracleI am not selling opposing credit spreads to hedge the trade. Instead I will closely manage the risk. I don't like to sell credit call spreads after a sharp drop in price like XOM has recently had.I can close it at any time for partial gains or losses. I may need to manage this risk through future earnings reports. The short-term price reactions earnings report are often a coin flip.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director ofSellSpreads.com.

Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Holders Shouldn’t Worry About Oracle;2/15/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAll too much like James Cameron's 2009 sci-fi flickAvatar, just when you think the feud betweenAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) andOracle Corporation(NYSE:ORCL) is over, you find out it's not.* Last week, the iconic database company told the iconic search engine company it was appealing a ruling made against Oracle - in favor of Alphabet - in May of last year.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockFor better or worse, GOOGL stock owners either didn't hear, or didn't care. If it's the latter, it's not terribly surprising. The company formerly known as Google is sued on a regular basis, often by parties with weak cases just looking for a payday.GOOGL shareholders may want to take a closer look this time around though. While successful appeal cases are tough, Oracle's argument holds slightly more water than the typical long-shot caselike the one Vringo levied (and ultimately lost) back in 2014. Moreover, the case itself could have significant repercussions for other outfits in the heat of similar arguments about open source software.GOOGL: Here We Go AgainWarning: You may need to read through the intricacies of this case twice to fully understand what's going on, and even then, there's no guarantee it will make complete sense. Here's the crux of the argument though … Oracle says Alphabet used a little too much of its Java software - which is free, open-source software - in its Android operating system.The suit largely hinges on what constitutes ""fair use"" of open-source and freely-available software.7 Stocks to Buy for the Future of TVWhile Oracle offers Java for any consumer to download and any developer to utilize pieces of, the company contends it was never intended for wide swaths of the code to be cut and pasted and utilized as part of a commercial, revenue-bearing system.The complaint specifically read:""The undisputed evidence showed that Google verbatim copied the heart of Oracle's creative work for an entirely commercial purpose without any change to Oracle's expressive content or message, took far more than necessary to program in the Java language, and, in so doing, harmed the market for Java.""The strength of Oracle's copyrights on its application programming interfaces, or APIs, was particularlyemphasizedby the company in the prior jury trial.Alphabet's counterargument is simpler -CEO Larry Page said, ""We didn't pay for the free and open things.""If all of this rings a bell with GOOGL stock owners, there's a reason. This argument has been waged in a courtroom a few times, going back as far as 2010. The current stage for this battle of the titans is an appeal of last year's loss suffered by Oracle. That case's loss likely saved Alphabet Inc from being forced to pay the $9 billion in damages Oracle was seeking.Bottom Line for GOOGL Stock, and OthersOwners of GOOGL stock don't have a great deal to worry about here. The courts sided with the company in the most recent case, and appeals - a reversal of a prior judgment - are very difficult win.The case, though, will have far-reaching consequences beyond the Alphabet/Oracle tiff. In essence, this contest could largely help affirm just how ""open"" open source code really is even if its user ends up commercializing it as Alphabet did with Java via Android. Perhaps in a bigger sense though, this trial will once again serve as an indictment on decency (or lack thereof) and common sense (or, again, lack thereof).Why Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock Could Fly to $1,000 in 2017While not a legal matter raised during any of the lawsuits' arguments, all juror's minds were apt to be asking themselves why Oracle would offer Java in part or in whole for free - even for commercial uses - if it didn't want it to be used this extensively.Another relevant but unasked question is why Java's original developer, Sun Microsystems, supported Android's use of the platform before Oracle acquired Sun, but Oracle switched gears on the stance after buying Sun Microsystems. And, perhaps if Oracle had been more clear about how its rampant use of it in the Android OS had ""harmed the market for Java"" when it's not really otherwise monetized, a judge and jury could have been a little more sympathetic.As it stands though, the Oracle argument looks to be founded more on regret and frustration and less on merits. The courts so far seem to be picking up on that.Broadly speaking, it all bodes well for other entities that have somehow commercialized open source software and APIs.* Avatar, while a stunningly successful film, was a three hour epic, and could have easily ended at two points in the film before the third (and actual) ending.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 Super-Safe Dividend Growth Stocks to Buy Today10 Stocks to Buy That Already Make America GreatThe postAlphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Holders Shouldn't Worry About Oracleappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Should I Buy General Motors Company (GM) Stock? 3 Pros, 3 Cons;2/15/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsGeneral Motors Company(NYSE:GM) has certainly made a tremendous comeback since 2008, after having to declare bankruptcy. But there has been little for investors to cheer about. Back in late 2010, the company pulled off its IPO at $33 a share. But now GM stock is at only $37.20.makeArticleAd();Source:William Oliver via Flickr (Modified)To put things into perspective,InvestorPlace.com'sDana Blankenhorn has noted: ""Ever since the 2008 crash and government bailout, General Motors stock has been treated like dirt. No matter what GM does, it can't get out of first gear.""I actually think this is an understatement!Of course, Wall Street can be inexplicable. Yet eventually investors will recognize the value. Hey, this has happened with other stocks that languished for a long time, such asMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT), right?OK then, so would GM stock be a good play right now? Or should investors hold off? Well, to see, let's take a look at 3 pros and cons on General Motors:3 Pros On GM StockMomentum: For the past two years, General Motors has posted record earnings, net revenues, EBITDA and free cash flows. As forlast year, revenues increased by 9.2% to $166.4 billion and free cash flows came to $6.9 billion, up $4.7 billion from the previous year.7 Tech Stocks That Could Implode at Any MinuteThen again, General Motors has continued to pump out popular cars, with global sales at 10 million (making the company the No. 3 player). A big part of this has been the continued success in North America. But of course, China remains a major factor as well. Last year GM reported3.87 million car sales in the country. Keep in mind that the company sells more in China than any country, including the U.S.But GM has also been judicious with discounts and promotions. For the most part, GM is focused on making sure it makes profits, not just on increasing marketshare.Innovation: One of the hottest categories in technology is the auto industry, as seen with the efforts with operators likeAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG),Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) andTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA). The good news is that GM has been ramping up its investments. To this end, the company made a $500 million investment inLyft(a top ride-sharing startup) as well as a $1 billion acquisition ofCruise Automation(a developer of autonomous car systems).Already there are signs that GM is getting traction. For example, the company is testing over 40 autonomous Bolt EVs. But there are also some other innovations, like Maven. This is a mobile platform that allows a person to search and reserve a car and unlock it with a smartphone. According toGM: ""With more than 25 million customers around the world projected to use some form of shared mobility by 2020, Maven is a key element of our strategy to changing ownership models in the automotive industry.""It's important to note that GM has the advantage of leveraging its experience with OnStar, which has been around for two decades. In fact, during this time, the system has logged about1.5 billion customer interactions.Yield & Valuation: GM has certainly been shareholder friendly. Last year, the company returned a hefty $4.8 billion - in a combination of share buybacks and dividends. In fact, GM stock has a nice yield of 4.1%.But the valuation is also attractive. Consider that the forward price-to-earnings ratio is at a lowly 6.1X. True, this may be deserved for a company that is showing declining growth. But as for General Motors, the company expects to increase the top line for 2017.In other words, the stock does look like a great value play right now.3 Cons on GM StockCompetition: The environment is brutal. And with more dealmaking, things will only get more intense. An example of this is the alliance ofRenault SAandNissan Motor Co Ltd (ADR)(OTCMKTS:NSANY) - which also involved the purchase of a large stake inMitsubishi Motors. With this, the companies were able to realize significant cost savings and also hit a global sales number of nearly 10 million last year.Although, accordingFiat SpA(ADR)(OTCMKTS:FIATY) CEO Sergio Marchionne, an automaker may need to reach levels of15 million cars sold annually to be competitive! The reason is that R&D will inevitably increase because of the enormous costs of new technologies.As a result, a company like GM may have little choice but to look for a similar alliance or a transformative acquisition, which would definitely be risky and expensive.Politics: The election of Donald Trump is a wild card for the auto industry. On the one hand, there are potential positives, such as with lower corporate tax rates and less onerous regulations.But these may not offset the issues with Trump's anti-trade bent. If there is a border tax, this could hurt GM because of its substantial production in Mexico. Actually, about 20% of light production is in the country. So if there is a border tax, it could mean higher prices in the U.S. - and yes, lower sales. According to theWall Street Journal: ""Even a more modest border tax under consideration would wipe out a quarter of GM's regional profit.""Global Issues:While the markets in China and North America have been robust for GM, there has been much softness in many other areas, such as in Europe and South America. Granted, there are signs of improvement - but the progress has been fairly slow. For example, in South America, GM has been able to cut back on the losses. But there was still $374 million in red ink last year.As for Europe, the growth has been sluggish across the continent. It also does not help that England has enacted the Brexit, which has caused a lot of uncertainty. As a result, GM lost $300 million in Europe last year and it appears there will not be break-even until 2018. To put things into perspective, the company has not seen a profit in the region since 2000!Bottom Line On GM StockPerhaps the biggest issue facing GM stock is the uncertainty regarding Trump's trade actions. Although, given the importance of the auto industry to the US economy, it does seem reasonable that any moves will likely be taken with care. Besides, General Motors CEO Mary Barra has been savvy to meet with Trump several times already.Gas Up With Chesapeake Energy Corporation (CHK) StockIn the meantime, she is doing a great job managing the core operations of the company. Note that there will be 18 new or refreshed models for five main brands in 2017, up from 13 last year. And yes, Barra has been aggressive with investments in new technologies.OK, so is GM stock a good buy right now? I think so, especially given the rock-bottom valuation.Tom Taulli runs the InvestorPlace blogIPO Playbookand also has his own free iOS app to estimate your tax refund, which is atPathwayTax.com.Follow him on Twitter at@ttaulli.

New Facebook Inc (FB) Video App Is Part of a Greater Plan;2/15/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsVideo is becoming increasingly important toFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB). Social media users are big on watching video, and video ads are an important revenue stream. But FB was missing out on the video action when members put down their smartphones to fire up the big screen in their living room. Not any longer. The company announced it's releasing a new Facebook video app for TV. The app will soon roll out to two of the most popular set-top streaming boxes.makeArticleAd();Source: FacebookYesterday, FB made the announcement that it will bereleasing a new Facebook video app for TV.This will be an app that's available for some of the most popular set-top streaming boxes and Smart TVs.

Twitter (TWTR) Rises as CEO Buys Shares Worth $7 Million;2/15/2017;"Reportedly,Twitter Inc.(TWTR)CEO Jack Dorsey has bought around 426,000 shares worth $7 million of the company this Valentine's day. The founder director tweeted the news with the hashtag ""#Love Twitter"" from his account. The news led to an upside in Twitter's share price.Twitter, Inc. PriceTwitter, Inc. Price|Twitter, Inc. QuoteNotably, Twitter's shares have largely underperformed the broader market. The company has been witnessing sluggish user expansion and revenues have grown just 1% year over year in the recently reported quarter. We note that Dorsey's strategy of focusing on live and user friendly changes have not generated the desired results for Twitter.Amid the exodus of top level executives and poor quarterly results, the latest development has managed to generate considerable momentum for the company and rekindle investors' interest.Previously, Dorsey had gained around $11 million by selling his shares in Square Inc. The move to buy Twitter shares can be seen as Dorsey's effort to reassure dismayed investors who have been on the edge given its unabated troubles.   Generally it is said that when a founder buys shares of his own company, it implies that the stock has much upside potential.Dorsey has often been widely criticized for playing the dual responsibilities of heading both Twitter and Square, especially when both the companies are at crucial junctures. Dorsey was quoted by media reports saying ""My intention is to serve both companies in every way I know how and make sure that we are really focused on what's most important for each.""Last year, rumors about Twitter's probable sale did the rounds. Big names like AlphabetGOOGLand The Walt Disney CompanyDISwere speculated to have shown interest in buying the micro blogging site. But there was a twist in its 'takeover' tale with most bidders pulling out of the race. Reportedly, profitability issues, stagnant user growth and infamous trolling incidents did not do much justice to the estimated bid price of $16 to $20 billion.Zacks Rank & Stock MovementAt present, Twitter has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We note that Twitter has vastly underperformed the Zacks categorizedInternet Softwareindustry inthe last one year.

Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: Twitter and Alphabet;2/15/2017;"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL - February 15, 2017 - Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Features: Twitter (NYSE:TWTR-Free Report)and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL-Free Report).How Twitter Can Fix Itself by Learning from YouTubeWhen Donald Trump first began gaining some momentum in the presidential race, it looked to be pretty fantastic news for Twitter (NYSE:TWTR-Free Report), and investors in the social networking giant too. After all, Trump would frequently go onto the site to announce new plans or fight back against his detractors. It was (and continues to be) an incredible resource for political updates.Now that Trump is President, his tweets move markets. His attacks on companies can send share prices lower in a heartbeat and are an important thing to consider for investors these days. Some haveset up apps to track his tweetsand how they relate to the market. Others do a tweet analysis in order to get better insight into the mind of the President, includingThe Atlantic'sTrump Tweet Tracker.But beyond Trump, Twitter also managed to become the single greatest collection of primary sources of all-time. When breaking news happens, it is almost always reported first hand on Twitter, and then it is disseminated out from there.You'd think that these factors alone would make Twitter an unstoppable media juggernaut. A must for journalists and those seeking to stay up-to-date on the news alike. So how has Twitter capitalized on this incredible timing and presidential stroke of luck? Well, in short, it hasn't.Bad Earnings Report AgainThe company posted yet another disappointing quarter for Q4, missing expectations on the revenue front and posting shockingly poor active user figures. It remains stuck around the 320 million active monthly user mark, and can't even seem to grow revenues either. Add in disappointing adjusted earnings guidance, and it isn't a great situation by any stretch forTWTRinvestors these days, especially given that the company has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).And let's remember, these figures are with the leader of the free world literally using the service to clarify policy and goals on a regular basis. The environment cannot possibly get any better for Twitter. Its product is in the news on a near hourly basis at this point and it still can't find a way to get the job done.Clearly, Twitter needs a shakeup and it needs a bit of a Hail-Mary in order to get back into investors' good graces. So, what can the company do?Twitter Needs to Copy YouTube. Now.Fortunately for Twitter, the path to relevancy and growth is already laid out before them. The good folks at Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL-Free Report) have already done all the hard work in their YouTube division and Twitter needs only to copy their best practices.First and foremost is capitalizing on the incredible missed opportunity of getting an ad right on to tweets. As you can see in the picture below, there is always a big white box at the bottom right hand corner of each tweet.Why not fill that with a small advertisement? Sure, some people are not going to like that, but people will adjust accordingly. We saw something similar with YouTube where at first only certain videos had ads, and now nearly everything has an advertisement before the video. People have adapted and it has become the norm to see this before a video. People will do the same with Twitter (and embedded tweets) and this will help with casual users (much the same way embedding helped with casual YouTubers).After all, these casual users who mostly see tweets embedded somewhere else make up a huge base of people and are arguably the key to Twitter's success. Finding a way to make money off these people-much like how YouTube doesn't need you to be signed in or making videos to make revenue off of you-should be paramount in Twitter's near term plans.According to Twitter,embedded tweets reach more than a billion peopleeach month across the web, a truly massive figure. And that number is actually from before Donald Trump burst onto the scene and tweets were on the nightly news on a regular basis.But what if people hate this idea and recoil from the service? Well, an easy way to placate people will be to pay the content generators for the work they are doing. Giving tweeters a slice of the ad revenue that they generate would go a long way to getting people and small businesses to tweet more, and it is pretty much akin to what YouTube does with their stars. AndTwitter has even looked to do this on the video side, so why not extend it over to their bread and butter anyway?Bottom LineAre some of these ideas going to be popular? Definitely not. But Twitter needs to try something in order to jumpstart its floundering share price and lackluster growth. Everything needs to be on the table, and now is the time to do it.The company finds itself in a truly historic position and it is an opportunity that isn't going to come around every four years. The confluence of Trump and the increased desire for real-time (and unfiltered) news from around the globe should be a godsend for Twitter, but the company has completely failed to capitalize on the trend.Taking some of YouTube's best practices might be a good place to start in order to return to relevancy though. It certainly has a better shot of reviving the stock than anything Twitter has come up with recently, and it could push TWTR back towards growth too.And a position of growth would make Twitter a much better candidate for a takeover, perhaps from a company like Alphabet. Such a partnership makes a lot of sense and it would allow better integration between Google search results and tweets, while the melding of tweets and YouTube comments would be a great match as well.So, if Twitter wants to get to this end-which seems like the best possible outcome for TWTR investors at this point-take a page out of YouTube's book and start thinking about ways to get more ads out there, and how to benefit creators in the process. Because if Twitter can't take some risks and find a way to make things work when their service is at the forefront of news and popular culture like it is now, they never will.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your   inbox?Zacks' free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.Get it free >>Get the full Report on TWTR - FREEGet the full Report on GOOGL - FREEFollow us on Twitter:https://twitter.com/ZacksResearchJoin us on Facebook:https://www.facebook.com/ZacksInvestmentResearchZacks Investment Research is under common control with affiliated entities (including a broker-dealer and an investment adviser), which may engage in transactions involving the foregoing securities for the clients of such affiliates.Media ContactZacks Investment Research800-767-3771 ext. 9339support@zacks.comhttps://www.zacks.com/performancePast performance is no guarantee of future results.

Facebook (FB) Launches New TV App for Apple TV & Others;2/15/2017;"Social media giant,Facebook Inc.FBhas unveiled a new TV app to enhance the video viewing experience. The app will be initially available on app stores on Apple TV, Amazon Fire TV and Samsung Smart TV and will be rolled out to other platforms gradually.In a blog post, Facebook said that the app will enable users to ""watch videos shared by friends or Pages you follow, top live videos from around the world, and recommended videos based on your interests."" Currently, Facebook enables users to stream videos on their TVs from their Facebook page.Facebook, Inc. PriceFacebook, Inc. Price|Facebook, Inc. QuoteFurther in the post, Facebook said that going forward, mobile users will be able to hear sound automatically in their news feed. Earlier, one had to tap on the video to listen but with the new feed, there is no need for that. Users can choose to ""disable"" the feature by switching off ""Videos in News Feed Start With Sound"" in Settings. Also, Facebook has improved vertical video experiencing on mobile phones by incorporating a ""larger format."" The company also introduced a picture-in-picture view that will help users to watch videos and scroll at the same time.As video ads generate more revenues than its photo and text-based substitutes, Facebook and a host of several others social media sites like TwitterTWTR) and Snapchat are trying to incorporate more and more video oriented content to bring in more ad dollars. Ad revenues contribute over 90% to Facebook's total revenue. Per media reports, Facebook is looking to grab a share of the reportedly $70 billon brand advertising that is allocated to linear TV by increasing video content on its platform.  At its last earnings call, Facebook said that video emerged as a ""megatrend"" on the same lines like mobile.However, Facebook is yet to work out an ad model for live video. Given CEO Mark Zuckerberg's aversion to pre roll ads, Facebook is reportedly testing a new ad platform - mid roll format - whereby publishers will be able to put in ads in a video (which has a minimum duration of 90 seconds) after a user has played it for 20 seconds or more. Reports add that Facebook will share revenues with publishers in a 45:55 ratio, similar to that of Alphabet'sGOOGLYouTube.At present, Facebook has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Moreover, we note that Facebook has outperformed the Zacks categorizedInternet Servicesindustry in the last one year.

How Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Turns Lemons Into Profits;2/14/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOver the past few months,Facebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) has had to revise its advertising metrics several times to account for errors. For the most part, the errors seem relatively minor and have had little impact on FB stock.makeArticleAd();Source:Via Stock SnapIn September, management disclosed that the reported figure of average time spent viewing a video was inflated. A company post in November cited a summary figure of ""reach"" (the number of Facebook users who viewed an impression in their timeline) as being overstated.In two more posts the following month, further problems were announced and more changes were made. The company changed its methodology for measuring reach (not just reporting the figure). ""Reactions"" to live video were mis-allocated, and counts for ""likes"" and ""shares"" had been miscalculated.Again, Facebook stock investors seem relatively unconcerned. In fact, the FB stock price sits at an all-time high. But, combined with general concerns about ""click fraud"" and other problems in the online advertising space, the metric changes highlight a key issue for Facebook - and online advertising as a whole.How Facebook responds as a company will be key for Facebook stock.Click Fraud, Bots and Facebook's ResponseIn a widely cited figure, the Association of National Advertisers estimated that online ad fraud would cost $7.2 billion in 2016. (Bear in mind that Facebook alone generated $27 billion in revenue last year.) Estimates of how many ads are fraudulent range from 30%-60%. Indeed, many analysts have forecast a collapse in the online advertising space as a whole.7 Stocks to Buy That Could Double by 2018Much of the questionable activity comes from bots, which mimic actual online users. There are also ""click farms,"" malware and display tactics such as ""pop-under"" ads, which are rarely, if ever, seen. Most of the complaints are directed at traffic generators and other middlemen. But, some argue that programmatic marketplace operators such asRocket Fuel Inc(NASDAQ:FUEL) andCriteo SA (ADR)(NASDAQ:CRTO) are turning a blind eye to these issues.Facebook is not implicated in these tactics. In fact, the company's efforts outside the platform have shown a notable willingness to fight low-quality tactics. In 2016, Facebook shut down its Atlas ad-buying platform. Its head of ad tech wrote in a blog post, ""We were amazed by the volume of valueless inventory"" coming into that exchange. That poor traffic was a key reason for management's decision to move on.Another unit, LiveRail, was shut down last year as well. Facebook paid a reported $400 million-$500 million for that company, with the goal of building a video ad exchange. But, similar to Atlas, fraud and traffic concerns led FB to shut down the ad exchange. (In both cases, Facebook has salvaged measurement capabilities from the business.)The irony of the questions surrounding Facebook's metric changes is that, so far, when confronted with the worst of the worst in online advertising, the company has acted in a seemingly ethical manner.But the question for FB stock is what the apparently worsening state of ad tech means going forward.Are Growing Ad Tech Concerns a Plus or Minus for Facebook Stock?The core concern regarding not just fraud, but poor measurement of online advertising impressions and click-throughs, is that advertisers can't accurately gauge ROI. Facebook's recent measurement errors - including inflated video duration figures for more than two years - seem of a piece with that concern.There are other issues with the Facebook platform, too, including fake accounts, for instance. In the filings ahead of the Facebook IPO, the company estimated that 8.7% of accounts were fake. That figure was later updated to a range of 5%-11%. Click farms lead to paid promotions for users that aren't real potential customers. The same issues that plague online advertising more generally seem to pop up for advertisers on Facebook as well.But, there's an argument that the problems in online advertising could represent another growth driver for Facebook stock. The company's closed ecosystem eliminates many of the middlemen that are alleged to cause the disruption in programmatic marketplaces. While there are fraud problems, management continues to aggressively work to resolve those problems.Facebook's long-term growth potential - which, in the end, will drive FB stock - is based on happy customers. But keeping happy customers means Facebook must fix any potential fraud problems as quickly and aggressively as possible.Facebook is doing just that. Management announced last week that it would submit to third-party auditing by the non-profit Media Rating Council. Twenty-four third-party companies now have access to the platform to improve measurement. FB is providing more data, and more options for buying as well.Why Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Holders Shouldn't Sweat SnapchatIf the concerns about online advertising are accurate - and there's an awful lot of evidence at this point - Facebook seems better-positioned than its rivals, should advertisers pull back. Rather, Criteo, Rocket Fuel and evenAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL) seem far more at risk.In that scenario, actually, Facebook's attractiveness to advertisers would onlyincrease. A closed platform, improved measurement capabilities and third-party verification would offer confidence to those advertisers not available elsewhere on the Web.And that would be a boon for FB stock.As of this writing, Vince Martin did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceThe 3 Best Bear Trades on Wall Street Right Now7 Dividend Stocks for the Retirement You DeserveApple Inc.

Apple at All-Time High: Poised for More Growth as Anticipation for Next iPhone Builds;2/14/2017;"In anticipation of its 10thanniversary iPhone, due out this spring, Apple Inc.AAPLlooks poised to build on its already stellar 2017. The tech giant closed Monday at an all-time high of $133.31 per share in after-hours trading, jumping 0.9%, and it is up to $134.19 after early Tuesday morning trading. Apple's stock is up 15% since the beginning of 2017.The company posted all-time high quarterly revenue of $78.4 billion in its first fiscal quarter of 2017, which ended December 31, 2016. Apple has once again reached an elusive $700 billion market value, after becoming the first publicly traded U.S. company to do so in February 2015. The $700 billion value places the company firmly at the top of the U.S. food chain, nearly $120 billion above GoogleGOOGL, now Alphabet.""We're thrilled to report that our holiday quarter results generated Apple's highest quarterly revenue ever, and broke multiple records along the way,"" Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a press release.""We sold more iPhones than ever before and set all-time revenue records for iPhone, Services, Mac and Apple Watch. Revenue from Services grew strongly over last year, led by record customer activity on the App Store, and we are very excited about the products in our pipeline.""The company's flagship product, the iPhone, was born on June 29, 2007. The transformative smartphone helped catapult Apple to where it is today.Now, nearly a decade later, details of the iPhone 8, or the iPhone X, a rumored name, might just pack enough new features to encourage a huge uptick in purchases. But more importantly, it could signal that Apple is once again making massive jumps in innovation, which the last few iPhones lacked.The normally measured Cook spoke recently about groundbreaking new plans, which could include augmented reality.Leaks about the upcoming iPhone have started to come out,and they are bold. Some of the ""supply chain"" leaks suggest Apple's new iPhone ""will change this industry deeply.""Speculation suggeststhe iPhone 8 could be made almost entirely of glass, charge wirelessly and come in three different sizes.It could also have an OLED screen, which would help boost battery life dramatically.Cook announced last month Apple's plan to double the company's $24.35 billion services business by 2021. The CEO also suggested upcoming tax reforms would allow the company to bring home cash held overseas to help bolster mergers and acquisitions.International sales accounted for 64% of Apple's first quarter revenue. This is massively important as the company tries to hold ground in highly competitive Asian markets, especially China, the world's largest smartphone market. Part of this growth is due to increased app purchases and streaming music subscriptions.Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc.,BRK.Ahas poured millions of dollars into Apple over the last year, which brings its stake to nearly $1.5 billion. The ""Wizard of Omaha"" backing a company is rarely a bad sign.However, iPad sales have leveled off, and the Apple Watch has not yet made the splash the company has hoped for. But the Apple Watch still claimed63% of the still new smartwatch marketin the fourth quarter. Its second-generation waterproof model could be bigger than the first.And still, Apple's iOS products are on track toreach nearly a trillion dollars in sales.The company's Beats Electronics brand, which it purchased for $3 billion in 2014, holds a lot of cachet in popular culture, including professional sports and music. And their new Airpod earbuds have potential to catch on quickly.An estimated 85% to 90% of iPhone users will buy another iPhone, according to UBS. There are currentlyover 600 million iPhonesbeing used worldwide, many of which are models 6 or lower. This means a lot of people could upgrade this year, especially with the introduction of iPhone X, its most game-changing phone in years.Which Stocks are Zacks Experts Talking About?makeArticleAd();Stocks in today's headlines may be tempting buys, but how would you like to peek behind the curtain to see all the best stocks Zacks' team of experts are recommending?

How Twitter Can Fix Itself by Learning from YouTube;2/14/2017;"makeZacksArticleAd();When Donald Trump first began gaining some momentum in the presidential race, it looked to be pretty fantastic news for Twitter (TWTR), and investors in the social networking giant too. After all, Trump would frequently go onto the site to announce new plans or fight back against his detractors. It was (and continues to be) an incredible resource for political updates.Now that Trump is President, his tweets move markets. His attacks on companies can send share prices lower in a heartbeat and are an important thing to consider for investors these days. Some haveset up apps to track his tweetsand how they relate to the market. Others do a tweet analysis in order to get better insight into the mind of the President, includingThe Atlantic'sTrump Tweet Tracker.But beyond Trump, Twitter also managed to become the single greatest collection of primary sources of all-time. When breaking news happens, it is almost always reported first hand on Twitter, and then it is disseminated out from there.You'd think that these factors alone would make Twitter an unstoppable media juggernaut. A must for journalists and those seeking to stay up-to-date on the news alike. So how has Twitter capitalized on this incredible timing and presidential stroke of luck? Well, in short, it hasn't.Bad Earnings Report AgainThe company posted yet another disappointing quarter for Q4, missing expectations on the revenue front and posting shockingly poor active user figures. It remains stuck around the 320 million active monthly user mark, and can't even seem to grow revenues either. Add in disappointing adjusted earnings guidance, and it isn't a great situation by any stretch for TWTR investors these days, especially given that the company has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).And let's remember, these figures are with the leader of the free world literally using the service to clarify policy and goals on a regular basis. The environment cannot possibly get any better for Twitter. Its product is in the news on a near hourly basis at this point and it still can't find a way to get the job done.Clearly, Twitter needs a shakeup and it needs a bit of a Hail-Mary in order to get back into investors' good graces. So, what can the company do?Twitter Needs to Copy YouTube. Now.Fortunately for Twitter, the path to relevancy and growth is already laid out before them. The good folks at Alphabet ( GOOGL) ( GOOG) have already done all the hard work in their YouTube division and Twitter needs only to copy their best practices.First and foremost is capitalizing on the incredible missed opportunity of getting an ad right on to tweets. As you can see in the picture below, there is always a big white box at the bottom right hand corner of each tweet.Why not fill that with a small advertisement? Sure, some people are not going to like that, but people will adjust accordingly. We saw something similar with YouTube where at first only certain videos had ads, and now nearly everything has an advertisement before the video. People have adapted and it has become the norm to see this before a video. People will do the same with Twitter (and embedded tweets) and this will help with casual users (much the same way embedding helped with casual YouTubers).After all, these casual users who mostly see tweets embedded somewhere else make up a huge base of people and are arguably the key to Twitter's success. Finding a way to make money off these people-much like how YouTube doesn't need you to be signed in or making videos to make revenue off of you-should be paramount in Twitter's near term plans.According to Twitter,embedded tweets reach more than a billion peopleeach month across the web, a truly massive figure. And that number is actually from before Donald Trump burst onto the scene and tweets were on the nightly news on a regular basis.But what if people hate this idea and recoil from the service? Well, an easy way to placate people will be to pay the content generators for the work they are doing. Giving tweeters a slice of the ad revenue that they generate would go a long way to getting people and small businesses to tweet more, and it is pretty much akin to what YouTube does with their stars. AndTwitter has even looked to do this on the video side, so why not extend it over to their bread and butter anyway?Bottom LineAre some of these ideas going to be popular? Definitely not. But Twitter needs to try something in order to jumpstart its floundering share price and lackluster growth. Everything needs to be on the table, and now is the time to do it.The company finds itself in a truly historic position and it is an opportunity that isn't going to come around every four years. The confluence of Trump and the increased desire for real-time (and unfiltered) news from around the globe should be a godsend for Twitter, but the company has completely failed to capitalize on the trend.Taking some of YouTube's best practices might be a good place to start in order to return to relevancy though. It certainly has a better shot of reviving the stock than anything Twitter has come up with recently, and it could push TWTR back towards growth too.And a position of growth would make Twitter a much better candidate for a takeover, perhaps from a company like Alphabet. Such a partnership makes a lot of sense and it would allow better integration between Google search results and tweets, while the melding of tweets and YouTube comments would be a great match as well.So, if Twitter wants to get to this end-which seems like the best possible outcome for TWTR investors at this point-take a page out of YouTube's book and start thinking about ways to get more ads out there, and how to benefit creators in the process. Because if Twitter can't take some risks and find a way to make things work when their service is at the forefront of news and popular culture like it is now, they never will.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks' free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.Get it free >>Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Paypal and Alphabet Spell it Out for Investors;2/14/2017;"Two big heavyweights of the tech industry,PayPal(NASDAQ: PYPL) andAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) , reported their fourth-quarter   results earlier this month, and Motley Fool analysts Dylan Lewis   and Sarah Priestley have dug through the reports.In this episode ofIndustry Focus: Tech, they share the most interesting points from both reports, from   the most important earnings numbers to little Q&A gems that   shed some light on each companies' long-term plans, and more.A full transcript follows the video.makeArticleAd();Find out why PayPal Holdingsis one of the 10 best stocks to buy nowMotley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent     more than a decade beating the market. (In fact, the newsletter     they run,Motley Fool Stock Advisor,has tripled the market!*)Tom and David just revealed their ten top stock picks for     investors to buy right now. PayPal Holdingsis on the list-- but there are nine others you may be overlooking.Click here to get access to the full       list!*Stock Advisor returns as of January 4, 2017This podcast was recorded on Jan. 27, 2017.Dylan Lewis:Welcome toIndustry Focus, the podcast that dives into a different sector of the stock   market every day. It's Friday, Jan. 27, and we're breaking   them quarterly results   from PayPal and Alphabet. I'm your host, Dylan   Lewis, and I'm joined in the studio by fool.com tech   editor Sarah Priestley. Sarah, how's it going?Sarah Priestley:It's good, it's a pleasure to be here, thank you for having   me.Lewis:Are you excited for pizza day?Priestley:I am very excited. It's going to derail my New Year's   resolutions, but that's OK. [laughs]Lewis:That's a callback to your episode with the Vincent Shen. Are   you finding that the Apple Watch is being helpful?Priestley:Yes. It's definitely reminding me at 9 p.m. that I   have done 0 steps, so I just end up walking around my living   room like a crazy person.Lewis:I do that when I'm on the phone all the time. That's how I   get my exercise in.Priestley:That's probably a good idea, yeah.Lewis:So, Sarah, a ton going on in tech this week, the next   couple weeks with earnings. Two pretty followed   Fool companies reported yesterday after the bell. We dug   into the reports and are ready to talk about them. You   did some of the heavy lifting with PayPal; I dug into   Alphabet. Why don't we talk about PayPal first. How did the   results look?Priestley:To give you an overview for the fourth   quarter, earnings came in at $0.42 per share. $2.9 billion   in revenue. Operating revenue was a little higher than   expected at 21%. Transactions were $1.8 billion. But the volume   was below expected. Expected was $100 billion and they   delivered $99.3 billion. And that is why share prices are down   about 3.5% this morning. So, it seems like a slight   overreaction when you dig into their numbers. But,   yeah, that's the reason for the share price falling.Lewis:And that's really one of the core metrics that investors tend to   focus on for them as a company, right?Priestley:Absolutely. They really are measured on engagement,   so number of customers, and engagement of those   customers, and the key metrics for those.Lewis:Looking beyond some of the top line numbers, what else   popped up to you in the report?Priestley:The operating margin for the fourth quarter was down   to 15.4%. The reason that we're commenting on this is that   that's a lot, it takes up a lot of room in the bullish   theses, that the new partnerships they've started   with a lot of the banks,Visa,Mastercard, they're going to really pressure their margins down.Lewis:Is the thought there that they're working with very big   institutions and big players, and they just don't have the   negotiating room that they might with some smaller players?Priestley:Absolutely. That's part of it. And also, it's just the   standard transaction payment. It's the same thing forSquareand other payment processors; it's a standard transaction   amount on card processing. So, that 15.4% compared to   16.1% in the fourth quarter of last year -- you can see,   that's quite a decline there. Management has talked about the   fact that they are really doing everything they can to leverage   their other income against this. And I feel like they've done a   pretty good job. Their CEO, Dan Schulman, has said that   they won't be a slave to quarter-to-quarter margin   performance.Lewis:Which is something we like to hear as Foolish investors.Priestley:That's very true. And, I would also comment   that the management team is really being driven for   their compensation package on the long-term performance of   this stock, and I think that really shows in their   reporting. They're focused on free cash flow in   their projects, and what they're delivering to their   customers. Just to give you a couple of the year-over-year   figures: Earnings per share for the year increased 15% to   $1.15. Non-GAAP was $1.50 on guidance of $1.45 to $1.50. That's   pretty good. Revenue for the full year was up 17%, and 21% on a   currency-neutral basis, and they guided for 19%, so they really   beat that.Lewis:Like Alphabet, their fiscal Q4 comes with the calendar   Q4, so we were able to look at full year results   here, and not just the quarterly results. What's going on   with total payment volume? I know that's something that   people really like to focus on with them.Priestley:Yeah, absolutely. If we had seen total payment   volume less than 25%, I think we would have seen a bigger   decline in the stock price. Luckily, for the fourth   quarter, payment volume was up 25%. As I said,   the actual processed amount was $99.3 billion, which missed   the expectations. Interestingly, the majority of this was pushed   by international. International expanded 27%. The U.S. was   23%.Lewis:And for the unacquainted, total payment volume is   just the gross amount that they are helping to   facilitate.Priestley:Yes. The way to look at this is, the total payment   volume is the number of payments that they process. Then,   the transaction is the amount that they process. So,   they're averaging about $56 per transaction right now.   That's slightly down from $60 that they were averaging a   couple quarters ago. But it's still very good.Lewis:So, for the amount per transaction to be down, they must be   doing more total transactions to be making it up in   volume and still be seeing growth, right?Priestley:Yes, you're exactly right. I will also comment   that, of their transactions in their Q4, $100 billion was mobile   payments, which is an increase of 55%, and it's almost a third   now of their transactions processed. Which is fantastic, and I   think the management team has really isolated that as an   opportunity for the company. That's where they're going to really   demonstrate their industry leadership. The market is moving   toward mobile, and they're really pioneering in the mobile   industry.Lewis:So what can people expect looking forward, either first   quarter of 2017 or further out, broadly in 2017?Priestley:Absolutely. I'll look for 2017 quarter four revenue   we're expecting to grow on a currency neutral basis 16%   to 18%. That gives you a range of $2.9 billion to $2.95 billion.   That was actually slightly more conservative   than some analysts were expecting, which played into their   share price performance today. But full-year performance is   strong, revenue growth 15% to 17% and 17% to 19% currency   neutral, which gives you about $12.45 billion to $12.65   billion.Lewis:Is there anything to worry about with some of these   numbers that we're looking at, that management growth   projections are different than what the market is expecting?   Because, they are still very much in growth mode as a   business, and I know that early on, those projections, if they   start to decelerate at all, can start to scare people off a   little bit.Priestley:I think they have been fairly conservative in some of their   estimations, because they really do have a huge potential   with the mobile traffic. I think, if you look at some of   their projects that they're working on now, Venmo has   increased 100% year over year. It wasTime Magazine'sbest app, it's processed $5.6 billion, which was up 126%.   So, I think they have a huge potential with a lot of   the projects they're working on; they've experienced huge   growth. The problem with these is that they are not monetized   yet. And an analyst actually raised the question in the   earnings call: ""Is your projection in 2017 building   in some of the expectations for monetizing this, and   also Xoom?"" which is their international money transfer program.   They dismissed this. They said it was pushing out to 2018,   some of the opportunities, and that they will be   focused on growth. So, I think, for 2017, these might be   conservative estimates. But for 2018, we might actually   start to see the fruits of that labor.Lewis:Yeah, and you said, 55% of what was being processed, broadly   for the business, was coming from mobile. When you look at   Venmo specifically, that is almost entirely mobile. It's   more peer-to-peer. There are some questions about whether or   not they will be able to monetize that very well, and what   that might look like, because me giving you $5 because you   bought me lunch the other day, they don't really take anything on   that.Priestley:No, they don't. And something to say   is, it's becoming a hugely crowded market. I   think PayPal, to some degree, has a first-mover advantage,   but they're definitely not the biggest player in this   industry. The banks have gotten together and created   clearXchange, which is a peer-to-peer payment which is also   free right now. It's owned by the banks, so it has a lot of   clout. Whether or not people pick it up to the rate that they've   picked up Venmo, which is hugely popular with millennials, a   lot of our friends use it all the time, we use it. Also,Apple. Apple has grown hugely. Tim Cook in his last earnings call --   so, this is a bit outdated -- said that 75%   of swiping transactions were from Apple Pay.Lewis:Wow. It's hard to believe. Anecdotally, though, when   I'm out with my friends, and maybe you can lend some color   on this too, if someone covers the tab, I'm paying them via   Venmo. No one is ever like, ""Do you haveBank of Americamobile payment processing?"" So, they do seem to have that   first-mover advantage, and I think they have that name   recognition. When you have that huge installed base, as they do,   it really comes down to whether they can flip the monetization   switch on. I guess investors are going to have to be patient   on that, if management is pushing that out to 2018.Priestley:Absolutely. I will say, they do have a lot of   initiatives that are panning out for them right now. One   Touch basically enables you to fill in your bank   details, and you work through PayPal, and you can just click   one button at the checkout and it's transacted   through PayPal, which is hugely beneficial for   mobile. I don't know about you, but frequently, when   I'm  looking at shoes online, as soon as I get to the   card payment, and you have to zoom in on those small boxes and   put your card numbers in, they lose me. I think it's something   like a 74% cart-abandonment rate on mobile.Lewis:So when people reach that checkout phase and they see   that they need to drop in their credit card number, their   security code, their address, shipping address, zip code, all   that stuff, they wind up ditching it?Priestley:Absolutely. But, PayPal One Touch, they have 87%   conversion rate on mobile. That's incredible. They've had a   lot of people starting to use that. They have added a lot of One   Touch users. And, I think, of their merchants, about one-third   right now are on One Touch. And they just launched this last   year. So there's a huge potential here for them to really   deliver on their promise. They've said they want to make   customers' lives easier, and they're doing that, absolutely.Lewis:Anything else that management provided color on with the   business, and strategically where they're looking,   that investors should know?Priestley:I think the focus is absolutely on mobile. Dan Schulman   has definitely commented on the fact that mobile is the   biggest opportunity for them, and there are a lot of   industry tailwinds that they're experiencing right now.   And I would completely agree. I think Black Friday this   year was the biggest online shopping day in history.   In quarter three last year -- we're still waiting for   quarter four -- the Census Bureau said that online   retail made up 10% of all retail transactions. So you can see   that if they are positioning themselves well to benefit from   this, it should be a rising tide that lifts all boats.Lewis:I know they've talked a little bit in the past   about continuing to be an asset-light business. Is that   something that management recommitted to in the most recent   call?Priestley:Yeah, absolutely. This is something that analysts have   been focusing on. I definitely noticed a couple of questions   about this in the earnings call. Square offers capital, it offers   loans, as part of its services. It's not a huge part of their   business, but it is a risk area of the business. So, in the   fourth quarter, they had $123 million loss on loans. As a service   similar to the company Square, which deals mostly with small   businesses, but obviously this is individuals, PayPal has access   to a lot of people's information and their spending habits and   how much money they have. So they want to really leverage that   information, and offer it out to partners to facilitate the loans   using their information, which takes the risk away from PayPal,   but they're still generating a percentage of income from it. So,   overall, Dan Schulman commented that it's a really   competitive environment for this. I think the payment space   is just getting more and more competitive, every angle of   it. But overall, I think this is definitely a good   move for the company. It's the right decision, it's   going to eliminate some risk. But it's also potentially   going to bring in a degree of revenue too, if they can grow   that segment.Lewis:So, it seems like the general takeaway here is: Wait and see   with a lot of the company's mobile initiatives. The core   business seems to be humming along. There was a little bit   of disappointment, but nothing thesis-altering, nothing   crazy in the report.Priestley:No, absolutely not. And they didn't touch too much   on some of their partners. They've had some really   high-profile partnerships withAlibaba,Vodafonein the U.K. and Europe, and many others;Discover, that they recently announced. They didn't touch on that   too much, so we can't really give investors a good flavor for how   that's going, only that it's in line with   their expectations. So, yeah, I agree with what you   said. I think mobile is going to be a big area of focus,   we'll continue to have a look at those transaction volumes and   customer engagement.Lewis:So Sarah, I said that you did the heavy lifting   on PayPal. I did most of the homework with Alphabet's   earnings. I'm going to flip it over to you and let you host   for the second half of the show.Priestley:It's really nice to not be in the hot   seat. [laughs]Lewis:Yeah. I'll stop firing questions at you. It's my turn.Priestley:So, yeah, Alphabet reported the same time, yesterday   after the bell. What were the results?Lewis:Overall, Alphabet's revenue came in at about $26.1 billion   for Q4, up 22% year over year, which beat analysts' estimates of   $25.3 billion. Earnings per share came in at $7.56, slightly   lower than analysts' projections of $7.63 per share. I think the   real story -- and what caused some of the immediate reaction   for the stock -- was that adjusted profit missed by much more.   That came in at $9.36 a share, versus expectations of $9.64 a   share. We saw, after hours, the stock was down about 2.5% to 3%.   That's what most of the market seemed to really fixate on.Priestley:And what was the cause of that?Lewis:Tax rate, basically, is the short of it. In Q4, Alphabet had an   effective tax rate of 22%. They also highlighted their broad 2016   tax rate, because they're able to report whole fiscal year   results as well. The company's effective tax rate for the year   was 19%. That's a big bump. And you realize that average is also   incorporating other quarters. You can get a sense of how much   more they were paying out in taxes this quarter. Really, if you   want to get down to the   nitty-gritty, MarketWatch writer Jeremy Owen   does a really good job breaking down the specifics,   but the gist of the issue is, the Financial Accounting   Standards Board issued some changes a while back, basically   impacting how companies can treat stock-based compensation   for their adjusted earnings numbers. And that wound up impacting   results for this quarter. Moving forward, the company   will no longer be excluding stock-based compensation   expenses from their non-GAAP results, which should smooth things   out. But they wound up dealing with a little bit of a hiccup this   quarter to reconcile.Priestley:Yeah, that's really unusual, the change for GAAP   there.Lewis:Yeah. Typically, you think of non-GAAP numbers as   being something where the Financial Accounting Standards   Board gives people a decent amount of latitude to operate   how they want to. But they like to rein things in every now   and then, specifically with stock-based compensation because   it's something that a lot of firms use to make their non-GAAP   numbers look quite a bit better than their GAAP numbers,   especially in the tech space. Looking at a couple of the   different segments, their Google segment, which is search,   ads, Android, Maps, Chrome, YouTube, pretty much   anything that falls under their internet properties, came in at   $25.8 billion. So, looking at a company with $26 billion in   quarterly revenue, that's the meat of it right there. That   is generally performing pretty well. Their Google Sites   segment, which is the majority of that, was up 20% year over   year. Network revenue up 7% year over year. Other revenue, which   is a smaller portion a little bit less related to the   internet properties within that segment -- think Hardware,   Google Play, and their cloud segment -- was $3.4 billion, which   was up 62% year over year. So, that's a very fast-growing   segment within Sundar Pichai's Google area of the   business.I think, if you're looking for indicators for them, the   two big ones that tell the story for the ad business and what's   going on with some of the internet properties: Aggregate paid   clicks, which is basically the number of times that people   are interacting with ads online, was up 36% year over year.   Aggregate cost per click, or CPCs, as they're commonly known, was   down 15% year over year. This is not really a surprise. This   is a story that's been playing out for a long time.   We talked about the shift to mobile when we   were talking about PayPal. The same thing is happening with   internet search. CPCs have been driven down because the   effectiveness of mobile ads isn't necessarily quite the same   as it is for desktop. But for the longest time, Google has been   able to make it up on volume. There's actually quite a   parallel there with what happened with PayPal and   the volume making up for the smaller transactions.   We're seeing the same effects here with Alphabet.Priestley:Would you suggest that's something that investors   should include in their thesis going forward?Lewis:I think it's something that, at this point, we shouldn't be   too surprised by. This story has been playing out for a decent   amount of time. If it really accelerates, you might have to   worry. But they have been very good at making the volume   make it work out. Eventually, mobile will need to find a floor   somewhere, and enjoy that. But so long as we're still in   that transition to mobile, I think we're going to   continue to see this for a while, unfortunately.Priestley:OK. What about the Other Bets segment? I know there   have been some interesting moves this year.Lewis:Yeah, this is something that people love to ask about,   because it's like, ""Where is Google wasting all of this   money?"" As a reminder, this is basically all the stuff they do   that isn't tied to their internet properties. Think of it as   their moonshot projects. The big financial contributors for this   segment are Nest, Fiber, and Verily. They tend to focus on a   full-year breakout for the segment because the numbers   are so small relative to the overall business. But revenue   came in at $809 million for 2016, which was up 82% year over   year. Operating loss not including stock-based compensation   was $2.9 billion, down slightly year over year. But,   this segment is still a money pit for Alphabet, and I think   it will continue to be. They have reined in costs a   little bit under CFO Ruth Porat. I think she has forced all of   the Other Bets initiatives to at least be able to show   a path to monetization, or a road map to what that might   look like. But I think there's a certain   test-and-innovate atmosphere that they want to maintain.   And investors have been OK with that, because their core   internet business just prints money for them.Something that is interesting with them and the Other   Bets segment is, they spun out Waymo, which is their   autonomous driving segment. For the longest time, that was   the Google Self-Driving Car Project. A couple months ago, they   said, ""This is a stand-alone business unit, and it will be nested   within the Alphabet holding structure. It will continue to be in   Other Bets."" And we didn't get any financial insight into   what's going on with that. But they talked about it in the call.   Ruth Porat provided some commentary on what   they're basically doing with Waymo as a blueprint for what   they will continue to be doing with Other Bets. Not a ton to   report there, but this is something that Daniel Sparks and   I talked about in a podcast when they announced that a few   months ago. As we, in the next couple quarters, over the   next year, continue to get more information about Waymo, I   think we can look at that specific business segment and see the   path for what's going to be going on for some of the Other   Bets as they continue to mature and eventually see   monetization. So, not a ton to report with Other Bets stuff,   but at least we have something that we can start to track   for what the company's ambitions might be.Priestley:Absolutely. It looks like they're moving forward with   that. Was there anything else in the numbers that stood out   to you in the earnings call?Lewis:I think some of the things that people need to keep in   mind with this report, because the stock was down after   hours, I think as of taping this morning, they were down 40   or 50 basis points, so not a crazy reaction like 3% that we   saw after hours yesterday, but still down, I think   people might be scratching their heads a little bit with some of   the tax stuff they saw. Prior to the report, the company was   trading at all-time highs. It's traded up for a while. I   think it's somewhere in the teens in the last year or so. So,   there's that. And also, Alphabet does not provide   detailed quarterly guidance. Most companies do offer up   that guidance, and analysts create their own models based on   those numbers, those line items, and they have their puts   and takes to tweak it slightly. But because Alphabet doesn't   give those baseline expectations, the likelihood of   actual numbers being different than analysts expectations   is slightly higher than it would be for other   companies. So, the market's reaction is always, I think,   generally going to be a little bit sharper than what we   might see for a company that does offer standard   guidance.Priestley:Yeah, because they have nothing ready to peg   their estimates to.Lewis:Yeah. They have the general trend of things and what   they can glean from commentary. But very often, you'll   see analysts' expectations more or less mirror guidance   with slight adjustments. Not having that as a   crutch can just add some unpredictability to things. I think   that's the way you have to think about it.Priestley:Any other little gems?Lewis:Outside of the numbers, something that caught my eye that I   think is a great point, and really underscores the   importance of reading company conference calls, and not   just relying on the numbers that you see reported and the   quick earnings takes you'll see online: Mark Mahaney   from RBC Capital Marketsin the Q&A section of the call asked this really   great question, and I think it points to a looming risk   for Alphabet, and I just want to highlight that for   listeners. He said, ""It looks to me like Google devices are   being outsold 10 to 1 or something like that in most homes.   It's immaterial now, but you could see you in five   years there's a new voice search interaction   interface and it's not Google in the home. That could   be a real challenge for the company."" And he was basically   positing, ""What are you guys doing about all of the   virtual-assistant and smart-home devices?""Priestley:Yeah, great question.Lewis:Yeah. And Sundar Pichai, Google CEO, he gave that   generally positive answer, talking about the investments the   company is making and how they're working toward voice   search, and how they're trying to meet consumers in every   situation that they might be using voice search, whether it   be phones, TV, homes, cars, whatever. But really, at its core,   Mahaney's question is getting at this idea of: Amazon's   Echo devices are selling like hotcakes. If the installed   base for them, or really any other virtual assistant,   gets massive, and consumers start using those   devices for the types of things and the purposes   that people are generally using Google mobile   and desktop search for, what does that do for your   business? I don't want to be alarmist with any of this. I am an   Alphabet shareholder, I really love the company. But I think   he makes a good point. Earlier this month, actually, at an ad   industry conference, there was anAmazonVP talking about some of the capabilities and   some of the opportunities that Amazon might explore. That   led some analysts to speculate that the company might   be interested in exploring paid search with its Alexa product.   This is not something that is a next-quarter, next-year issue.   But over the next five to 10 years, we need to keep an eye   on how people are using search, and how people are using   home assistants or virtual assistants. Because, if we   see that slowly eat into what would otherwise be desktop or   mobile search, you have to wonder about how that   might impact Google's core business, and really what   prints money for them and allows them to fund all of these   other projects.Priestley:Yeah. And also, which products they're using.   If everybody starts adopting the Google Nest, then they're   good.Lewis:Yeah. If people are using Nest or Google Assistant, then   yeah, not a huge problem, that will keep them within that   ecosystem. If they are using products that don't lean   on Google search, and you have platforms that are able   to monetize that search, Google might get crowded out a   little bit. Again, Google did $26 billion in revenue this   quarter. The vast majority of that was online ads. It's a   huge market. I think people's more in-depth searching, or more   research-based stuff, is always going to be on desktop or   mobile. You can only glean so much from audio. But if you   want the quick answer on something -- say you want to know   who was the fifth president of the United States -- you can   find that out with a voice search, and not really have to   worry about being on mobile or desktop. And that's less   impressions for Google Ad Search. So, it's something to keep   in mind. Again, this is a five, 10-year risk. But,   just, investors, keep an eye on what's going on with   the virtual assistant market, because it's something that   could impact Alphabet down the road.Priestley:That's really interesting. I will hand the baton back   to you. [laughs]Lewis:Oh, you're going to let me wrap up? That's so   magnanimous of you.Well, listeners, that does it for this episode ofIndustry Focus.

Take Tesla Inc (TSLA) Profits, Pour Them Into Twitter Inc (TWTR);2/14/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) andTwitter Inc(NYSE:TWTR) are both momentum (or momo) stocks. Usually these are fast-running stocks where most of the buying and selling is done on faith rather than science. That means conviction is based more on speculation, and not so much valuation.makeArticleAd();Source:WEnet Studio Via Stock SnapBefore you send out the posse to get me for calling TSLA or TWTR stock speculative, let me explain what I mean.WhenApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) fell to $90 per share, I went long with conviction based on pure valuation versus price math. Price fell to a level where Apple shares were a slam-dunk buy based on income, cash and stock price.Compare this with any long trade I've done on TSLA stock. My thesis has never been about valuation. Around $200 per share, I sold puts in Tesla expecting that buyers would step in to support the stock. At $225 and $255 per share, I wrote about going long based on pure technical breakouts.Just last week, I wrote about theopportunity to profit from TSLA stock even if it stalled. Over $3 in profits came fast. So I need to roll out of those profits and find another place where risk is less obvious.My portfolio almost always has a small portion reserved to speculative trades. As I close my spec trade on Tesla stock, I want to roll the risk into a bet on TWTR shares.5 Income Tax Deductions You Can't Afford to MissWhy Twitter? Especially when I've been so vocal about their management's incompetence?Last week, Wall Street negatively reacted to Twitter's earnings report in a violent manner. TWTR stock fell 15% in a matter of hours. But what got my attention more so than Twitter falling off the cliff was the high number of downgrades to ""sell"" from the analysts. This sounded like capitulation in coverage, where almost everyone gave up on the idea of higher prices soon. If I am correct, then this greatly reduces the number of incremental sellers.This would also give me levels against which I can sell risk.How to Trade TWTR Stock HereThe first bet:Sell the TWTR Jan 2018 $13 put for $1.40 per contract to open. By selling naked puts, I am committing to owning Twitter stock at $13 per share if it falls beneath it. My breakeven point would be $11.60 per share, and anything below it would then accrue losses for me. This trade has a 15% buffer from current price and a 70% theoretical chance of success.TWTR stock would have to repeat the drop from last week and set a new all-time low for me to start losing money. Nevertheless, I could modify this trade to being a credit put spread, thereby greatly reducing the worst-case scenario.The alternate bet:Sell the TWTR Jan 2018 $13/$10 credit put spread, but for only 85 cents per contract. That said, in this structure, my max risk is defined to the width of the spread less what I collect to open the trade.Both trades have the same odds of success.Run With the Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Bulls NowSomeone who is optimistic about a buyout could use some of the premium to buy calls, but this is not for me. While I do believe that there could be support here, I have zero faith that TWTR management could pull off a miracle.I am not required to hold these trades open through expiration. I can close them at anytime for partial gains or losses. I could even buy sacrifice penny priced puts to give me cover for the next few weeks.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director ofSellSpreads.com.

Exploiting The Amateur Investor's Edge: Investing In What You Know To Discover Bargains And Earn Conservative, Outsized Returns;2/14/2017;"ByMichael Seeley:""Buying what you know about is a very sophisticated strategy that many professionals have neglected to put into practice.""[i]- Peter LynchThe author isn't sure just how descriptive the above statement is when applied to institutional money managers and investment analysts today. The ones we have spoken to seem to have a very detailed understanding of all the companies and industries they cover. The author does believe it accurately describes the average individual stockpicker.makeArticleAd();IntroductionInvesting, as practiced by the average investor, is a game rigged so the housealmostalways wins. Wall Street will take the average investor's life savings, and will do so dispassionately and unapologetically. This fundamental understanding is essential to engaging in buying and selling activity in the market.""Investing is a zero-sum game. To buy a stock, someone else has to be selling.You are betting you know the company better than the person that is selling it to you.""[ii]- Peter LynchMake no mistake about it, buying and selling stocks is a competition. It is serious, it is real, and if one is not constantly aware of this fact and doesn't take it seriously, one is apt to be a sucker. Someone is always trying to either sell someone else an overpriced security, or they are trying to buy another person's underpriced security for pennies on the dollar. That is what the market often is,[iii]an exchange to take advantage of the person on the other end of a transaction. This reality is not always appreciated, as one's competitor is rarely seen, but it is a competition all the same, and one with real financial stakes. Every single time you buy or sell a stock, there is somebody on the other side of that transaction betting you are wrong, and they are betting real money on it. They are also betting they know more than you, and they are trying to exploit your ignorance in the business underlying the security.""There are rich teams, and there are poor teams, and then there's fifty feet of crap, and then there is us."" - Brad Pitt's character Billy Beane in Michael Lewis'Moneyball,speaking of the Oakland AthleticsWhat's more, the game most institutional money managers and Wall Street institutions play is stacked heavily intheirfavor. They have more resources than the amateur investor, better industry coverage, better contacts, better access to management teams, better technology, brilliant (and let's face it,moreintelligent) analysts with more prestigious post graduate and doctoral degrees from the finest institutions in the country. Playing a game even remotely in this machine's wheelhouse is almost certain to be a disaster. The chances are that those institutions are generally on the other side of every transaction the amateur investor enters into.If the reader is not yet discouraged, he or sheshouldbe. Forgetting the above facts and becoming complacent, or even arrogant, will not lend the sense of humility and caution that are necessary for successful stock picking. A measure ofarroganceis necessary in picking stocks, but it must always be balanced with humility and awareness, and it is good only when logically supported by research and analysis. All of this brings us to a harsh truth that the reader will be wise to remember.""Choosing individual stocks without any idea of what you're looking for is like running through a dynamite factory with a burning match. You may live, but you're still an idiot.""[iv]- Joel GreenblattIf we accept Mr. Greenblatt's statement as true, and the author is a firm believer it is true, then why even try to buy and sell individual securities?Well, the real truth is that buying and selling individual stocks is generally only stupid if one engages in the practice in the way almost everybody always does. Put another way, there is a right way, and then there is the way nearly everyone does it.The right way is the exception.Despite all the above, the amateur may still achieve results in excess of the majority of the professionalsifthe amateur insists on playing his or her own game on his or her own field. To make money consistently over the long term, the investor needs toonlybet when the odds are in his or her favor; in other words, only when he or she has anedgeover the competition.How do we do that? The author will answer the question by posing a few questions of his own:Wouldn't it be nice if undervalued companies that are profitable, with durable competitive advantages and reliable earnings streams, companies that may even be likely to compound over time had like a flashing light and loud noise going off to attract our attention, but only our attention (meaning most of the competition would miss the signs)?Wouldn't it be nice if we could take the thing we are best at, that we know the most about, and we could place bets on that, and even then could choose to only bet when we were certain, or nearly certain that we will win?What we will do in this particular article is to identify a specific ""edge"" that provides most investors a leg up over the large financial institutions and over the army of financial analysts on Wall Street. An edge is a place where the odds are stacked in your favor, through practice, knowledge, skill, time frame, or location. We will also provide real world examples on how to exploit these edges, but first, please permit us an analogy, to really drive the concepts home into the reader's grey matter.Selecting Your Opponent…I cannot help but remember my friend from London, in what is known as theEast End. Mr. McDonald-Smith is a fairly large man of Jamaican descent, speaks fluent Spanish due to a couple of years living in the Dominican Republic, and is, as they say in England, quite fit. You know the type, someone with arms the size of their head where even an extra-large shirt is in constant danger of popping its buttons? Mr. McDonald-Smith can honestly boast that he has never been beaten in arm-wrestling. This feat is not overly surprising when looking at him, but how is it possible that one can have a100%success rate in anything? Surely, there is always someone stronger, or more skilled, and even if there were no such person; doesn't everybody just have a bad day once in a while? In fact, Mr. McDonald-Smith is not an undefeated arm-wrestler because he is the strongest man in the world, nor is he undefeated because he is the world's most skilled practitioner of the sport. No, the fact is that Mr. McDonald-Smith is undefeated due to a very simple strategy that is designed to help him be successful.What is his secret? It is quite simple.He never engages in a match with anybody that he isn't absolutely certain he can beat.In such a manner, he can honestly say he has never been outmatched. He never has, and so long as he continues in his strategy, he never will be. As he grows older, he will undoubtedly accept fewer and fewer challengers until one day he will retire completely from this activity, undefeated and triumphant. Why is this important? Well, Mr. McDonald-Smith has an edge in arm-wrestling. He is large of stature. He is strong. He is fit. He is smart. And he manages his ego. Taken as a percentage, the probabilities of encountering a formidable opponent are quite small. On the rare occasion that he meets such an opponent, Mr. McDonald-Smith graciously declines the match.Now, here's the key to the strategy: It wouldn't work in a formal arm-wrestling tournament where one was forced to take on every opponent placed in front of him.In fact, it may be quite useless. While Mr. McDonald-Smith is likely to do quite well in a tournament, and he may even advance to the later rounds, he is unlikely to win simply because there is always someone stronger, or who has trained longer and more diligently. Luckily for Mr. McDonald-Smith, he needn't ever enter such a tournament. There is no reason to outside of ego.What is the point? Don't play if (and when) you can't win.Examples of Utilizing One's EdgeNow for some real-world examples to illustrate the value of investing in what you know, and using one's individual knowledge and skills to avoid losing money, and to achieve out-sized investment returns. As the author is trained as a tax CPA, these particular examples revolve around corporate income taxes. One needn't understand GAAP accounting for income taxes in order to understand the underlying point (If the author had been a used car salesman, we likely would have made some investments in car manufacturers or rental car companies (one could have made a lot of money investing in Budget, Avis, Hertz, Dollar, etc. if they understood the business). The point is to invest in what one knows and understands).It does not take many home runs and grand slams to result in a satisfactory investment record if one does not lose money in the process. This bears repeating, with emphasis. It does not take many home runs and grand slams to result in a satisfactory investment recordif one does not lose money in the process. That's not to say we try to swing for the fences. Most investors equate swinging for the fences with risk, but that is not the only way to hit a home run. When a perfect pitch comes along, a well-rehearsed swing can result in the ball just flying off the bat with ease. Likewise, sometimes, the most conservative investments can produce the most significant results; particularly if one understands the space and can recognize the opportunities and the risks. This also bears repeating. Sometimes the most conservative investments can produce the most significant results; particularly if one understands the space and can recognize the opportunities and the risks.Vonage(NYSE:VG) andSpectrum Brand Holdings(NYSE:SPB) are both examples of the author finding signals in financial statements to reveal attractive investment opportunities. In both cases, our attention was drawn by the inclusion of atypical effective tax rates in the respective company's SEC filings. Because of our experience with accounting for income tax provisions in our day job, we were able to quickly identify and interpret these signals despite working fairly hectic schedules, and after a review of the rest of the financial statements and the companies' business operations, market positioning, management, and outlook, were able to open an investment in a fairly timely manner, which turned out to be key, as the shares appreciated substantially post purchase.VonageStock High: $7.88 (01/13/2017)Recent Price: $6.88 (02/03/2017)Price Paid: $2.31; $1.71; $2.25 (01/24/2012; 5/25/12; 4/2/12)Vonage Holdings Corp.is an example of how experience in financial statement preparation, specifically the accounting for income taxes can lead one to a compelling investment thesis.VG is a voice-over IP ((VOIP)) communications company (i.e. an Internet-based telephone provider) with catchy television advertising spots featuring either someone on the beach getting hit in the head with a flying box with the Vonage brand on it, or with various personalities declaring their independence from land lines by stating ""this is my last phone bill"" and then crumpling it up and tossing it into a massive pile in the middle of a warehouse, suggesting that everyone is doing it. It was a trendy IPO that promptly plummeted and lost 80% of its market value. Having, for years during college, used AOL's (AOL) dial-up Internet CDs that came free in the mail to access the Internet, we appreciated how the bargain basement telephone service that Vonage provided could be attractive to low-income users, particularly those with non-resident family and friends. Having also been an early fan of Google's (GOOG) (GOOGL) Gmail chat and calling features (now called Hangouts), we and our work colleagues were already adopters of the technology. We recognized that, much like AOL's dial-up CDs had previously, land-based telephone lines were fast going obsolete. The Company had paid down approximately $130M in debt, bringing its leverage to about 0.5x net income, and reducing its interest expense year over year by 2/3. The Company had a fairly clean balance sheet, stable revenue, new apps and overseas partnerships, so good news on the horizon. Add to that a swing to significant profitability, and the Company was trading at a PE of less than 5x and an EV/EBITDA of 3-4x. The Company looked cheap on those metrics alone, and there were no signs that business would deteriorate any time soon.So where did our edge come in? What drew our attention to Vonage was the published effective tax rate ((ETR)). For calendar 2011 the ETR was a -375%, as in abenefit(another word for a tax gain, the recognition of which actually increases net income rather than decreases it) and not an expense. Now, in some situations, ETRs can be misleading, particularly when companies are operating near break-even, but Vonage was profitable in 2011 with pre-tax earnings of $86.3M. It pays to take a look at the footnotes and tax rate reconciliation in such situations to see what is driving the tax benefit.We reproduce the Company's tax rate reconciliation below from its 2011 Form 10-K:[v]Here we see that it was the release of a valuation allowance ((VA)) on the deferred tax assets (DTAs) that was driving the tax benefit (A valuation allowance is a fancy way of saying that an asset can't be recognized because it is uncertain if it will ever provide a benefit to the Company). By removing a VA, the Company is sending a signal that the benefit of the assets will be recognized, and the independent auditors must agree that such a position is reasonable. The next step then is to determine what deferred tax assets the Company is now benefiting from.Again from the 2011 Form 10-K:""Our net deferred tax assets primarily consist of net operating loss carry forwards (""NOLs""). We are required to record a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets if we conclude that it is more likely than not that taxable income generated in the future will be insufficient to utilize the future income tax benefit from our net deferred tax assets (namely, the NOLs), prior to expiration. We periodically review this conclusion, which requires significant management judgment. Until the fourth quarter of 2011, we recorded a valuation allowance fully against our net deferred tax assets.In 2011, we completed our first full year of taxable income and completed our budgetary process for periods subsequent to 2011, which anticipates continued taxable income in the future.""[vi](Emphasisadded)To interject some commentary here, what this means is that, by the fourth quarter of 2011, the Company had not only just demonstrated a pattern of profitability, but it was projecting profitability in the futureat leastsufficient to recognize the NOLs as DTAs without an offsetting VA. So now we know the Company expects to continue its pattern ofsignificantprofitability, and will largely be able to avoid paying taxes during the lifetime of the NOLs. But what exactly does that mean? Let's continue, and remember that the below numbers are shown in thousands (000s), so for example, $300,000 is really $300million.""Based upon these factors and our sustained profitable operating performance over the past three years excluding certain losses associated with our prior convertible notes and our December 2010 debt refinancing, our evaluation determined that the benefit resulting from our net deferred tax assets (namely, the NOLs),are likely to be realized prior to their expiration. Accordingly, we released the related valuation allowance against our United States federal and Canada net deferred tax assets, anda portionof the allowance against our state net deferred taxassetsas certain NOLs may expire prior to utilization due to shorter utilization periods in certain states, resulting in a one-time non-cash income tax benefit of $325,601 and a corresponding net deferred tax asset of $325,601 in the fourth quarter of 2011.""[vii](Emphasisadded)Accountants and attorneys love using run-on sentences. The $325Mbenefitthey are talking about recognizing now that they are removing the VA is not how much income the NOLs are expected to offset, rather, it is thetax effected(think cash tax savings impact) amount of U.S./Canada taxes that will not have to be paid in the future. Thegrossamount of income the NOLs can offset is shown below:""As of December 31, 2011, we had NOLs for United States federal and state tax purposes of $794,714 and $423,963, respectively…""[viii]One can see this activity occurring on both the balance sheet and the income statement. A quick review of the NOL expiration schedule in the tax footnote provides additional insight into theminimumprojected profitability of the Company over the next 18 years.So what did our quick check of the footnotes in the SEC filings yield? Not insignificantly, we discovered that the $326M taxbenefitin calendar 2011 was due to the release of a valuation allowance on $885M of Federal net operating losses (NOLs) booked as an asset on the balance sheet. What this means, in essence, is that the Company was not only demonstrating an impressive return to profitability in the prior year (2011), but that it also had significant expectations of profitability into the foreseeable future. Generally speaking, independent auditors are reluctant to sign off on such a large tax benefit/VA release without compelling income projections and a solid history of recent earnings that are more than sufficient to offset the NOLs. We have seen exceptions to this of course, but provided the auditor is reputable, those exceptions are few and far between.Bottom line; all else being equal, when a company with a $400M market capitalization and enterprise value recognizes a $326M GAAP gain due to the more-likely-than-not expectation ofat least$885M of taxable income over the coming years, and then add to that the PE and EV/EBITDA under 5x and very little leverage, it's a good bet that company is worth a whole lot more than the current $2/share.It also may provide a competitive advantage over new market entrants that must pay taxes over the coming decade.The cash that would otherwise go to pay taxes may be used to amortize debt, invest in the business, repurchase shares, pay a dividend, or any number of activities management may think of to create value and increase earnings further.With the Company's stock trading around $2 per share, and armed with the confidence provided by our edge in financial statement analysis (with particular focus on the income tax provision), and further armed with a sufficient understanding of the business in which it operates, we felt safe entering a position. The results were satisfactory, as illustrated in the share price chart below. Although the shares dipped not insignificantly immediately after our purchase, we took the opportunity to increase our position (remember, we could act with confidence because we understood what we owned, and what the Company and the auditors believed the future held). The shares doubled within the year, and have trended upwards since.LessonsWhen a company's shares are trading at an aggregate market capitalization of under $400M, is not heavily levered, and then that same company recognizes over $100M of annual EBITDA, $86M of pre-tax income, and on top of all that, books a $326M deferred tax asset for NOLs, that is a good sign that not only is the company expecting to earn income equivalent to the gross underlying NOLs prior to expiration, but also coupled with a clean balance sheet and sufficient cash that the company is worth looking at more closely.Spectrum Brand Holdings was in many ways the opposite of Vonage, but our attention was attracted for much the same reasons.Spectrum Brand HoldingsRecent Price: $132.76 (02/03/2017)Price Paid: $25.07 (10/19/11)""Decisions to buy and sell stocks should be based solely on the investment merits"" - Joel GreenblattSpectrum Brand Holdings owns a number of household brand names, including Rayovac Batteries, Black & Decker, Russell Hobbs, Black Flag, George Foreman Grills, Spectracide, Cutter, Repel, Armor All, STP, etc. SPB's debt-financed, acquisition spree in the 2000s resulted in a bankruptcy filing that wiped out shareholders in 2009. One can read more about the Company's backgroundhere.[ix]The Company was still recovering the following two years, when in 2011 we noticed the effective tax rate. We only even saw that as we were looking up Prestige Brands Holdings (NYSE:PBH) and mistyped the ticker symbol. Incidentally, we ended up entering positions in both companies (better lucky than good).""Our effective tax rate on income from continuing operations is approximately 24% and 249% for the Fiscal 2011 Quarter and Fiscal 2011 Nine Months, respectively.""[x]The impact to the tax rate reconciliation for the quarter was even more pronounced, in the event that a 249% effective tax rate wasn't enough to raise eyebrows.Thus, whereas Vonage had recognized a large taxbenefitdue to theliftingof a valuation allowance, Spectrum was recognizing a large taxexpense.This is generallynotgood. The question of course was why? Were earnings deteriorating? Was it merely do to a change in control? Were there not sufficient income projections going forward to offset NOLs? Reading further we got more information:""At July 3, 2011, we are estimating that at September 30, 2011 we will have U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $1,156 million and $1,006 million, respectively, which will expire through years ending in 2032, and we will have foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $143 million, which will expire beginning in 2011. Certain of the foreign net operating losses have indefinite carryforward periods. As mentioned above, limitations apply to a substantial portion of the U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards in accordance with IRC Section 382. As such, we estimate that approximately $299 million of our federal and $463 million of our state net operating losses will expire unused.""[xi]That last bit about the §382 limitations really just says that due to one or more changes in control (i.e. ownership transfers of more than 5% of the company, which will generally occur in a Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization) that there is a limit to how much of the NOLs may be used in any given year, irrespective of profitability. For example, if the Company were to earn $1.2B in fiscal 2011 (implausible we know, but we are making an illustration), Spectrum would belimitedto how much of the NOLs could be used to offset that income, and so on, and so forth until the NOLs expired.""The ultimate realization of our deferred tax assets depends on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character in the future and in the appropriate taxing jurisdictions.We establish valuation allowances for deferred tax assets when we estimate it is more likely than not that the tax assets will not be realized.We base these estimates on projections of future income, including tax planning strategies, in certain jurisdictions. Changes in industry conditions and other economic conditions may impact our ability to project future income. ASC 740 requires the establishment of a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In accordance with ASC 740, we periodically assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized and determine if adjustments to the valuation allowance are appropriate.As a result of this assessment, we determined that a full valuation allowance is required against the tax benefit of our net deferred tax assets in the U.S., excluding certain indefinite lived intangibles. In addition, certain other subsidiaries are subject to valuation allowances with respect to certain deferred tax assets. During the Fiscal 2011 Quarter we decreased our valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets by approximately $30 million. Our total valuation allowance, established for the tax benefit of deferred tax assets that may not be realized, was approximately $350 million and $331 million at July 3, 2011 and September 30, 2010, respectively. Of this amount, approximately $339 million and $300 million relates to U.S. net deferred tax assets at July 3, 2011 and September 30, 2010, respectively and approximately $11 million and $31 million relates to foreign net deferred tax assets at July 3, 2011 and September 30, 2010, respectively.""[xii](Emphasisadded)The Company's footnotes for fiscal 2010[xiii]revealed somewhat more detail on the NOLs and their expirations.Therefore, in contrast with Vonage, Spectrum did not anticipate being able to utilize its NOLs prior to expiration, due both to §382 limitations and/or insufficient taxable income against which to offset the NOLs. In addition, the Company was still fairly levered with $1.7B of long-term debt[xiv]on its balance sheet.So why were we interested? Well, we liked the assets and brands, which were consumer goods with respectable, durable competitive advantages. Although not always the market leader (e.g. Rayovac was competing fiercely with Energizer and Duracell on the platform of ""equal or better value at a lower cost""), the value proposition and barriers to entry were considerable. In addition, due to the heavy debt load which required about $200M of annualized interest payments[xv]per year, the income tax provision was skewing the effective tax rate; therefore, net income (and hence the PE ratio) were, if not entirely worthless, not necessarily reflective of the Company's cash generation capabilities, nor the value of the entire business.""Companies that spend money like drunken sailors, especially on acquisitions and real estate, are left with a huge depreciation allowance and a lot of debts to pay off, which gives them a high cash flow/low earnings profile.""[xvi]The truth was the Company had significant operating income[xvii]and was throwing off significant amounts of cash before interest payments and debt amortization.[xviii]The ETR attracted our attention, but upon closer inspection, we became comfortable with the Company's value strategy, its place in the market, the growth in its earnings and cash flow, its ability to service and amortize its debt, and the defensibility of its business. All things considered, we initiated a position and determined to watch the year-end results[xix]closely.SPB was trading in the $25 range prior to our entry. SPB has subsequently traded up to north of $130 per share. In this case, the ETR merely attracted our attention to a compelling investment possibility so we could study it further. It was a couple months later when the Form 10-K came out that we believed we had something really special. The Company had reduced its long-term debt by $180M from $1.72B to $1.54B[xx]and net cash provided by operating activities was $227M.[xxi]It seemed clear to us that the Company could service its debt load, and worst-case scenario could sell off one or more brands to de-lever further, but we didn't expect that would be necessary.Further research into SPB prior to the shares taking off similarly revealed an interesting arbitrage opportunity via the shares ofHarbinger Capital Group(NYSE:HRG), where one could take advantage of the value gap in SPB at the same time as one could take advantage in the value gap in HRG. This is further discussed immediately below, and is really an extension of the same investment.Lessons:""The best stock to buy may be the one you already own.""[xxii]- Peter LynchOne should listen to Peter Lynch and use one's unique edge to capitalize on opportunities in one's circle of competency.One should continue to listen to Warren Buffett and not sell out of a company with great long-term prospects, a durable competitive advantage, and growing earnings, which was purchased at a fair price. Just hold it forever (unless it is a cyclical).""As I study these reports now, I realize that many stocks that I held for a few months I should have held a lot longer. This wouldn't have been unconditional loyalty; it would have been sticking to companies that were getting more and more attractive…. By abandoning these great companies for lesser issues, I became a victim of the all-too-common practice of 'pulling out the flowers and watering the weeds'"" - Peter LynchHarbinger Capital GroupRecent Price: $16.79 (02/02/2017)Price Paid: $4.06; $4.10; $4.01 (12/29/11; 12/29/11; 12/31/2013)In 2010,Harbinger Capital Groupcontrolled Russell Hobbs, and merged it with Spectrum Brands, leaving HRG with a majority stake in SPB. HRG also owned a valuable insurance company. HRG was owned primarily byHarbinger Capital Partners(NYSE:HCP), a hedge fund that made billions betting against subprime mortgages during the credit crisis.HCP and its founder, Philip Falcone, were at the time under indictment by the SEC, which alleged that Falcone had misused fund assets for personal use, and that HCP had engaged in unfair redemption practices, allowing favored investors such as Goldman Sachs to redeem partnership interests, while locking up other investors (Note these allegations were later settled). The indictment had the result of temporarily depressing the shares of HRG, in our view, understandably, but excessively given the nature of holdings and operations in HRG. One may read a little about this arbitrage play in the comments of the above referenced article on Spectrum Brand Holdings, reproduced againhere.[xxiii]One may further read an article on this special situationhere.[xxiv]There was certainly some control risk in this arbitrage play, but during 2011, HRG actually traded at a value that was less than its publicly-traded ownership in SPB, giving a negative value to the insurance company. As SPB was similarly undervalued at the time, an investment in the undervalued HRG was another way to obtain the similarly undervalued shares of SPB at a significant discount to their trading value. This was just one of the odd, short-term arbitrage opportunities that occasionally arise in an otherwise efficient market. We held the position while the arbitrage gap narrowed, and then exited.It is important to note a couple of items. We were not comfortable holding HRG long-term due to the ownership situation. We would have been comfortable holding SPB forever, and SPB has certainly performed better than HRG over the subsequent time period. Sometimes we can be too smart by half, as we then missed out on the subsequent run-up in SPB shares. Thus, it often makes sense to pursue the simplest course. Complexity often equates with risk. The arbitrage play did work, however.Lessons:Sometimes we can be too smart by half, as we then missed out on the subsequent run-up in SPB shares. Thus, it often makes sense to pursue the simplest course.Complexity often equates with risk.Do you start to see how, with a little awareness and knowledge and skill and discipline you can win, most of the time, and you can win big? It just requires a little patience, and a littleuncommon, common sense.It is instructive to note that both examples occurred after the recent bull market was well underway. The Dow had recovered from a low of around 6,000 to 11,000-12,000, and despite not yet recovering its pre-Great Recession level of 14,000, many prognosticators and value investors were opining that the bull market was running out of gas and that values were few and far between. In August and September of 2011, just a few months earlier, the market experienced a slight correction. By investing in what we understood, we were able to find all kinds of bargainsafterour initial purchases during the Great Recession had significantly appreciated, and this was during a period of time when many were fretting the direction of the market and that there were few if any compelling values available. In our own wheelhouse, we were nearly tripping over them in late 2011 and early 2012.If that Didn't Convince You…In 1994, Mr. Peter Lynch of Fidelity Magellan fame said the following aboutedgesduring a lecture at the National Press Club. We are reproducing several paragraphs to drive the point home:""You need an edge to make money, too. People have incredible edges and they throw them away.I'll give you a quick example of, uh, Smith-Kline. This is a stock that had Tagamet. Now you didn't have to buy Smith-Kline when Tagamet was doing clinical trials. You didn't have to buy Smith-Kline when Tagamet was talked about in the New England Journal of Medicine, or the British version, Lancet. You could have bought Smith-Kline a year after Tagamet came out.Let's say your spouse, your mother, your father, your nurse, your druggist. You're writing all these prescriptions. Tagamet was doing an amazing job curing ulcers. And it was a wonderful pill for the company because if you stopped taking it, the ulcers came back. It wasn't a crummy product if you took it for a buck and then it went away. But it was a great product for the company. But you could have bought it two years after the product was on the market and made five-to-six times your money. I mean all the druggists, all the nurses, all the people, I mean millions of people saw this product. And they're out buying oil companies or drilling rigs. It happens.And then three years later or four years later, Glaxo, even a bigger company, this is a huge company, a British company, brought out Zantac which was a better, at that time an improved product, and you could have seen that take market share, do well, and you could have bought Glaxo and tripled your money.So you only need a few stocks in your lifetime. They're in your industry.I think of people, if you'd worked in the auto industry, let's say you're an auto dealer, the last ten years. You would have seen Chrysler come out with the mini-van. If you were a Buick dealer, a Toyota dealer, a Honda dealer… You would have seen Chrysler dealerships packed with people. You could have made ten times your money on Chrysler a year after the minivan came out. Ford introduces the Taurus Sable, the most exceptional line of cars in the last twenty years. Ford went up seven-fold on the Taurus Sable. So if you're a car dealer, you only need to buy a few stocks every decade.When your lifetime's over, you don't need a lot of five-baggers to make a lot of money, starting with ten thousand dollars or five thousand dollars.So in your own industry you're going to see a lot of stocks. And that is what bothers me.There are good stocks out there that are looking for you, and people just aren't listening. They're just not watching it. And people have incredible edges. People have big edges over me.They work in the aluminum industry. They see aluminum inventories coming down six straight months. They see demand improving. And in America today it is hard to get an EPA permit for a bowling alley, never mind an aluminum smelter. So you know when aluminum gets tight you just can't build seven aluminum smelters. So when you see this coming you can say, wait a second, I can make some money.When an industry goes from terrible to mediocre, the stock goes north. When it goes from mediocre to good, the stock goes north. And when it goes from good to terrific the stock goes north.There's lots of ways to make money in your own industry.You can be a supplier in the industry, you can be a customer. It happens in the paper industry, it happens in the steel industry. It doesn't happen every week, but if you're in some field, you'll see a turn, you'll see something in the publishing industry.These things come along and it is just mind boggling, people throw it away.""[xxv](Emphasisadded)The point is that nearly everyone has an edge. If they choose only to play their game in which that edge exists, they are more likely to come out on top. Of course, one must exercise the discipline of investing in one's own circle of competence, and then waiting for their pitch.ConclusionParticipating in the market is like fishing in waters teeming with both fish and sharks. If one just jumps in and tries to swim with the sharks, bad things are likely to result. And while we are on the subject of sharks…The author's spouse enjoys watching the CNBC showShark Tank. Last week, she made the comment that ""Mark Cuban is always 'out'. It has been a long time since he has made a deal."" Although she likely was frustrated by this observation, her comment caught our attention. We did a quick google search for ""Mark Cuban"" and ""investing"" on YouTube, and we found an interview[xxvi]from August 2011. Now, August 2011 was a month in which, after the market had gained maybe 80% since the 2009 great recession lows, the market started gyrating and was threatening to correct, and professional commentators were beginning to throw around the word ""recession"" again. A great many professional money managers believed the market was fairly, or even overly valued, and fear was again beginning to creep into Wall Street. In this interview Mr. Cuban said the following:""Any time there's volatility and any time there's change there's opportunity. Now I say it's great because I've taken a whole different approach to investing than most people.You know, I think buy and hold is a crock of sh--. I think, you know, the idea that you always have to invest your cash is not far behind, and so I've always been of the attitude that unless you really have a commitment to something, just keep your money in cash, knowing that at some point in time, there's going to be a week or two like we've had…""When the interviewer observes there has been a lot of ""stuff"" hitting the fan lately, Mr. Cuban continues:""Exactly the point. That's where the opportunity is. Then when everything starts getting crazy, I call it the world series of investing, you know, that's where you start digging in…You've got all these professional people on the other side of trades.When I started investing in stocks in the early 90's after I sold my first company, you could understand different elements of the market better than the professionals… Today there's so much money in these huge hedge funds, and they have such professional research, and in depth research,there aren't any advantages for the individual traders, and so my approach has always been,unless I know something specific, put it in cash.""(Emphasis added)We might take the creative liberty to amend that last sentence to replace the word ""any"" with the word ""many,"" but the point is largely the same. Most investors significantly underperform the market over the long run, because they invest in things they do not understand, they try to time the market, or they become emotional and jump in and out of securities rather than just staying put and letting the number of bargain purchases and the extent of the bargains in companies dictate how much of their capital is invested. Finally, they throw their edges away and play Wall Street's game. However, by following certain investing principles and by taking deliberate steps, the average investor can play their own game, on their own terms, and come out ahead.The successful, self-directed investor must adopt a proven, viable investment framework, insist on a margin of safety, and only play the game when the odds are stacked in the investor's favor. In other words, the investor must insist upon exploiting his or her edge. If this results in their being in cash, not when market prognosticators are preaching doom and gloom, and not when their emotions are telling them the market is overvalued, but whenthey simply cannot find compelling investment opportunities in their own wheelhouse, then holding cash may be the smartest thing one can do. The averageactive, self-directedinvestor should not be worried about having a significant amount of their portfolio in cash. Seth Klarman of Baupost fame has strung together a 30-odd year track record of significant out-performance, and absolute performance in nearly every year while holding nearly one-half of his fund in cash, on average. It is very difficult to lose one's money in cash. By being cautious and conservative when compelling bargains are not prevalent, and then by insisting on an edge before investing that cash in a security, truly amazing results can occur. This requires patience and discipline, but those are concepts for separate articles.As Peter Lynch has written, it only takes a few five-to-ten-baggers to result in an amazing long-term investment record (provided the investor doesn't make too many stupid mistakes in the meanwhile).""It was huge gains in a few huge positions that led to Magellan's superior results.""[xxvii]- Peter Lynch""I've said before that an amateur who devotes a small amount of study to companies in an industry he or she knows something about can outperform 95 percent of the paid experts who manage the mutual funds, plus have fun doing it.""[xxviii]- Peter LynchIf one is hell-bent on being fully invested at all times, one may conceivably invest the balance of their portfolio in Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) (BRK.B), just don't go investing in stocks in which you do not have an edge, merely because compelling bargains within your wheelhouse are few and far between. We all worked hard to save enough money to invest; in most cases for years, or even decades.

Run With the Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Bulls Now;2/14/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsDid you buy the post-earnings dip inAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL) last month? Since hitting a low near $812 on Feb. 1, GOOGL stock has steadily bounced back, regaining more than 3% of the ground it lost following a poorly received fourth-quarter earnings report.makeArticleAd();But you haven't missed out on the fun. Alphabet stock still has some gas in the tank.Click to EnlargeAlphabet's bounce from the $812 region was not happenstance. The shares were bolstered by support from their rising 50-day moving average, and a wealth of psychological support from the nearby $800 area. Furthermore, GOOGL stock has been in rally mode since mid-2015, gaining some 53% during this time frame.In other words, the post-earnings dip was less about poor quarterly results and more about an excuse to take some profits off the table.However, now that the situation has corrected itself, and Alphabet stock has emerged from an overbought situation, shares should be poised to run higher.If you took mybullish GOOGL recommendation on Jan. 31and got into the March $830/$850 bull call spread, you are likely already at breakeven or sitting on a profit for the trade. What's more, the odds of breaking out above $850 have improved significantly in the past couple of weeks.9 Top Pharmaceutical Stocks to Buy for the DividendsAlternately, if you took the more neutral-to-bullish option and entered the March $800 put sell, you can all but rest easy now that GOOGL stock is headed higher once again.If you missed out on those trades, though, there's still time to get in before Alphabet Inc tops out again.Sentiment for Alphabet remains as bullish as ever, with nearly all of the 48 analysts tracked by Thomson/First Call rating GOOGL stock a ""buy."" Additionally, the 12-month price target has risen over the past month to $990.72, and that bodes well for the shares going forward, as it cuts down on the likelihood of downgrades to ""hold"" over the short-term.As for options traders, a bit of caution has crept into GOOGL options since Alphabet's quarterly report, but this, too, is healthy for the shares. Currently, the March put/call open interest ratio rests at 0.76, up from pre-earnings readings near 0.85.Furthermore, peak March call OI rests well overhead at $900, meaning that Alphabet should see little in the way of potential options-related resistance.March implieds have come down since the end of January, making GOOGL options cheaper. Currently implieds are pricing in a potential move of about 3.3% for Alphabet stock through March expiration. This places the upper bound at $868, while the lower bound lies at $812.2 Trades for GOOGL StockCall Spread:If you missed out on the late January bottom, here's your chance to bet bullish on Alphabet heading into next month. I suggest the March $850/$860 bull call spread.At last check, this spread was offered at $3.57, or $357 per pair of contracts. Breakeven lies at $853.57, while a maximum profit of $6.43, or $643 per pair of contracts, is possible if GOOGL stock closes at or above $860 when March options expire.Don't Count Out Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Stock Just YetPut Sell:If you're still on the fence, or if you a neutral-to-bullish stance is more your style, then the March $800 put sell remains a solid trade that has a good chance of finishing out of the money.At last check, the March $800 put was bid at $3.30, or $330 per contract. The upside to this put sell strategy is that you keep the premium as long as Alphabet stock closes above $800 when these options expire. The downside is that should GOOGL trade below $800 ahead of expiration, you could be assigned 100 shares for each sold put at a cost of $800 per share.As of this writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceHere's Why General Motors Company (GM) Stock Will Drive to $42The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for 2017: The Experts' Picks7 Stocks That Will Drop by 10% or More This QuarterThe postRun With the Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Bulls Nowappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN): Is It Time to Start Worrying?;2/14/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) seems unstoppable. This is also one of the biggest problems for AMZN stock. When everyone is in, there is no upside left. Of the 43 analysts now covering Amazon,33 have it rated as a buyand none have it lower than a hold.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockBut the expectations attached to these recommendations are what should give Amazon bulls pause. Most analysts expect sharp acceleration of earnings this year, far beyond what the company has delivered so far, with estimates as high as $17.43 per share in 2018.AMZN is a company which, until recently, never made any money, instead being obsessed with plowing every dollar it could find into growth opportunities.Even after closing the books on 2016 - net income of $2.371 billion, or $4.90 per share on revenue of $135.987 billion - Amazon's profitability still trails that ofWal-Mart Stores Inc(NYSE:WMT), which earned $3.034 billion, or 98 cents per share, on revenue of $118.790 billion in the October quarter alone.4 Dow Jones Titans That Are Shooting HigherThe super-bullish stance on Amazon stock is based on the idea that, despite its growth, it still has a long way to grow, and that it will soon extract margins the retail industry has never seen.Forget stopping Amazon, though. But, can anyone hope to contain it?Eye-Popping NumbersAt its Feb. 13 opening price just below $832 per share, Amazon stock is selling at 168 times 2016 earnings. Its market cap of $402 billion represents approximately three times its sales, which is an absurd number for a company that is still, at heart, a retailer. Most retail market caps are a fraction of revenue.But of course, the bulls respond,Amazon isn't really a retailer. Indeed, AMZN is the leading cloud provider, a front-runner in artificial intelligence with Alexa, and is the first ""over the top"" video provider to gain Oscar buzz.All elements of its logistics are for sale, includingpayments, deliveries andeverything in between.Wherever you look with Amazon, you seeeye-popping numbers. It's not just an American growth story anymore,it's a global one.What Can Slow AmazonAmazon doesn't have to be stopped for AMZN stock to suffer. Any sign of a slowdown could cut its value by half, or perhaps even more.Source:FlickrJeff Bezos has been honest about what could happen. He is worried about""trade and protectionist measures""from the new Administration, and he isfiercely opposedto the Administration's recent orders on immigration.Political risks may have moved Bezos to buya $23 million housein Washington D.C. - and politics costs money. However, thosepolitical risks are not just Americanand they are not just physical. A Balkanization of the Internet - the requirement that local data only be used locally, and that citizens of each country read or see only what leaders want - could prove costly to implement. But, it's already happeningin the world of books.Despite efforts to control costs by owning its own logistics,delivery costs remain a concern.Is it Really Good to Be the King?Amazon may be King, but the crown hangs heavy. AMZN managers know thatcompetitors are catching up in the cloud space,Alphabet Inc.(NASDAQ:GOOGL) is challenging Alexa and has the capital to beat it in the cloud, and Amazon's success with tabletshas the potential to threatenApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL).7 Marvelous Mid-Cap Stocks to Buy for the Best of All WorldsNo tree grows to the sky, and likewise, no business can conquer the whole world of technology, media and retail. Amazon has a host of challengers wherever its managers look, and its ambitions are also facing political resistance.Does this mean I'm selling out of Amazon stock and predicting a crash? No. But, when everyone's telling you to buy something, that's actually when you should start to worry, and I've started to worry about Amazon.Dana Blankenhornis a financial and technology journalist.

3 Internet of Things Stocks You Don't Have to Babysit;2/13/2017;"The technology sector isn't always the best place for   investment stability, nor are new technology trends ever much of   a safe investment. But it doesn't have to be this way. The   Internet of Things (IoT) is ushering in a massive wave of   technological changes -- nearly 50 billion things will be   connected to the IoT by 2020 -- and there are three companies at   the forefront of this $7 trillion market that should remain   steady, long-term investments:Verizon Communications(NYSE: VZ) ,Cisco Systems(NASDAQ: CSCO) , andAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) .Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();Verizon CommunicationsVerizon is stalwart dividend stock that has plenty of   long-term potential in the IoT. The company already   dominates the wireless network space despite cutthroat   competition fromAT&TandT-Mobile, and it's only getting stronger.Verizon is making early investments in 5G networks that should   give the company an edge over its competitors in the IoT network   space, much like the company's early push into 4G kept it ahead   of the competition. Verizon calls 5G the ""foundation for creating   more internet-connected devices"" and says that it will use the   network to bring traffic lights, stop signs, parking meters, and   other city systems online.Over the next few months, the company plans on rolling out   commercial 5G field tests in a few locations. Verizon CEO Lowell   McAdam said at an investor conference in December that he   believes the company is two to three years ahead of the   competition for 5G because of its early tests and the company's   recent purchase of the fiber-optic network company XO   Communications.5G will allow new types of faster-than-ever device   connections, and Verizon's early mover advantage could pay off   down the road.Cisco SystemsCisco is a perfect example of a company that will plug away in   its respective field without offering investors much drama -- and   at the same time provide a nice 3.3% dividend yield to boot.Cisco has been talking about the IoT for quite some time, but   one of biggest moves came early last year when the company   announced it was buying Jasper Technologies for $1.4 billion.Jasper is a cloud-based IoT service platform that allows   enterprise and service customers to ""launch, manage and monetize   IoT services on a global scale."" In short, Jasper allows   companies to bring nearly any device online (think cars or jet   engines) and then manage those connections through its   proprietary software.Jasper brings with it 3,500 enterprise customers from around   the world that have devices running on 27 service providers.   And Cisco said that it will be able to add to Jasper's   services with its own enterprise Wi-Fi, IoT security solutions,   and advanced analytics.With Jasper, Cisco transitions further into the the   software-as-a-service (SaaS) market that brings recurring   revenue, and allows the company to rely a little less on the   traditionally cyclical hardware market.AlphabetAlphabet and its subsidiaries have been extremely aggressive   in the IoT space, and given the company's massive market size and   its quarterly revenues north of  $26 billion, this is   certainly a company investors don't need to babysit.Most of Alphabet's IoT opportunities stem from Google, which   is already a leader in the connected home space with Google Home   and Nest Labs. By having a slew of IoT devices for the home,   along with an embedded smart assistant in Google Home, the   company is helping to lead the way in IoT home connections.But one of Alphabet's biggest IoT pushes right now comes from   a company called Waymo, which wasrecently spun out of Google. Waymo is the product of years of research and real-world   testing of self-driving cars and Google is looking to the company   to now stand on its own and start generating revenue.Waymo has partnered withFiat Chryslerto bring 100 self-driving minivans to to the roadways to begin   testing an autonomous driving service. The company is likely   still years away from bringing in any significant revenue for   Google, but it's clear that under Alphabet's umbrella   self-driving tech is a big part of the company's IoT plans.On top of that, other companies under Alphabet are exploring   IoT possibilities, like usingnanoparticles to find diseasesin the bloodstream, by pairing them to wearable tech devices.Whatever you do, just don't miss this opportunityInvestors looking for steady companies shouldn't overlook themassive opportunities that the IoT has to   offer. Nearly 50 billion things will be connecting the internet in   just a few years and the IoT market has the potential to   transform many aspects of our lives. The three stocks above are   all big tech names that are tapping into the IoT's potential in   their own way, offering investors growth opportunities on top of   stable existing businesses.10 stocks we like better than Verizon     CommunicationsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Alphabet Inc – Is Google Assistant Going Everywhere? (GOOGL);2/13/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAlphabet Inc's(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Pixel Phone holds a significant advantage over third-party Android smartphones. Since its release, Google Assistant - the new AI powered personal assistant - has been a Pixel Phone exclusive. Third-party smartphones remain stuck with the previous generation Google Now. However, Google released an Android ""alpha"" build late last week and the new Android release enables Google Assistant on third-party smartphones.makeArticleAd();Source: GoogleGOOGL's third-party Android smartphone partners have been feeling a little betrayed since the release of the Pixel Phone last fall.Up until then, Google had not been directly competing against them. It developed Android and allowed them to use the operating system on their phones for free - a fair trade off for the hundreds of millions of mobile devices defaulting to revenue-generating Google search. Google did release the Nexus line of smartphones, but they were more of a showcase for Android than an attempt to compete against its partners.The Pixel Phone's Google Assistant AdvantageThe Pixel Phone changed the equation. It was stamped with the Google name for the first time and it was designed to compete head-to-head with the best of the Android smartphones. In another first, a key new Android feature - Google Assistant - was a Pixel Phone exclusive. Google Assistant leverages Alphabet's latest AI technology in a personal digital assistant that goes beyond Google Now, even gaining the ability to participate in two-way conversations.The situation was serious enough to help convince Android smartphone leaderSamsung Electronic Co Ltd(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) that it needed its own personal assistant. Samsung'sBixby is expected to debut on the Galaxy S8.7 Tech Stocks That Are Bucking the DowntrendNew Android Release Spills the Beans: Google Assistant for All?Android Policeexamined a developer ""alpha"" release of Android over the weekend and discovered thatGOOGL may be having a change of heartabout keeping Google Assistant to itself.Its team was able to activate and use Google Assistant on several non-Pixel smartphones, including a Samsung Galaxy Note 5 running Android Marshmallow and a Nexus 6P running Android Nougat.This means that GOOGL is at least experimenting with making Google Assistant available to third-party smartphones in an upcoming new Android release.Where Would This Leave the Pixel Phone?While Google's Pixel Phone has premium design and a very nice camera, its primary advantage over third-party smartphones is the exclusive availability of Google Assistant. Take that away and it's more or less competing on a level footing with the big guns from the likes of Samsung. True, the Pixel Phone is guaranteed Android updates, but that's no different than the Nexus phones.No, Apple Inc. Is Not Releasing the iPhone 8 EarlyWith AI and digital assistants in the spotlight, Google may have decided that having Google Assistant become a standard Android feature is important to maintain its lead overApple Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhones and Siri.I wrote a few days ago about Google's struggle againstAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN)in the smart home. The Amazon Echo and Alexa have taken a huge lead there and Google Assistant on the Google Home speaker and Pixel Phones may not be enough to catch it. If it were to give up its exclusivity and enable Google Assistant on third-party smartphones, GOOGL would suddenly have hundreds of millions of additional devices in play. This would give it far more leverage against Amazon, at the cost of the Pixel Phone competing on a more level playing field.And the company has always marketed the Pixel Phone as being the ""first phone"" with Google Assistant - not the ""only phone"" - leaving the door open for an eventual general roll-out.Of course, at this point we aren't certain that GOOGL will pull the trigger. The new Android release in question is alpha software - that'sbeforebeta. The company may simply be having some developers test Google Assistant compatibility with third-party hardware with no intention of actually opening up the feature. However, hints like the message ""New! You just got the Google Assistant"" suggest that GOOGL is leaning toward ending Pixel Phone exclusivity and rolling out the AI-powered feature as part of a general Android release.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceIs Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Ending the Age of Intel (INTC)?Report: Apple Inc. iPhone 8 Could Cost More Than $1,000 (AAPL)The postAlphabet Inc - Is Google Assistant Going Everywhere?

Facebook Agrees to MRC Audit Following Ad Data Discrepancy;2/13/2017;"makeZacksArticleAd();Facebook Inc.FBrecently agreed to evaluation of its advertising metrics by measurement watchdog Media Rating Council (MRC). This is quite unsurprising in the light of the confessions by the tech giant regarding its miscalculations of ad measurements last year.Last September, Facebook first indentified a ""mistake"" in it ads metrics. The company realized that it had been overstating the average time spent by users on watching videos. The company only took into account the video with views greater than three seconds, excluding the ones with the views of lesser time, thereby leading to greater than actual average view metrics. Following this, in Nov 2016, Facebook revealed that it had found 'discrepancies"" in calculation in four more metrics followed by two more in December.Facebook, Inc. PriceFacebook, Inc. Price|Facebook, Inc. QuoteFacebook had been facing pressure from advertisers and publishers to gain approval from MRC. Further, per media reports, Carolyn Everson, the global marketing solutions' vice president for Facebook has conveyed to the Association of National Advertisers that Facebook will be providing ""granular data"" to third parties like Integral Ad Science and Moat for making it easier for advertisers and publishers to verify data through the third party. Notably, the viewership of Facebook videos and Facebook Live has already been incorporated in Nielsen Holdings PlcNLSNDigital Content Ratings. She also added that the advertisement audits for the company will be ""administered"" by MRC.It is to be noted that Facebook earns the bulk of its revenues (over 90%) from the interactive and engaging platform it provides to advertisers. Advertisements accounted for 97.3% of revenues in 2016. Reportedly, Facebook is testing a new ad platform - mid roll format - whereby publishers will be able to put in ads in a video (which has a minimum duration of 90 seconds) after a user has played it for 20 seconds or more. Facebook might share revenues with publishers in a 45:55 ratio, similar to the pact with Alphabet'sGOOGLYouTube.Therefore, to alleviate the concerns of advertisers and publishers, Facebook has increased third-party verification.Zacks Rank & Stock MovementAt present, Facebook has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Moreover, we note that Facebook has outperformed the Zacks categorizedInternet Servicesindustry in the last one year. The company's shares increased 31.41% compared with the industry's gain of 17.80%.Key PickA better-ranked stock in the wider technology space is Oclaro Inc.OCLR, which carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Why Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Would Win Big With a Twitter Buyout;2/13/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsData it's what makes the tech world go 'round. And in the case ofAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), it's what drives its profits, cash flows and ultimately the value of its stock. Google has made a name for itself delving into people's lives, running it through an algorithm and selling the output to advertisers. Pretty much everything GOOGL stock does -even controlling your thermostat- has to do with creating this huge base of data for the company to play with.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockAnd its latest, and somewhat secret moves are all about getting its hands another massive pile of people's lives. Google is buying floundering social media networkTwitter Inc(NYSE:TWTR).Well, not entirely. But GOOGL has started picking off pieces of the Twitter corpse. And by snagging some of TWTR's items now, Alphabet could be setting itself up for to buy the whole enchilada later on. In the end, that actually might be a great deal for GOOGL stock investors as its all about the data.GOOGL Snags Developer ToolsTwitter has been a potential buyout candidate basically the second it IPO'd a few years ago. Perhaps even more so now that the social network has struggled to see user growth and profitability. TWTR stock has plunged about 60% since its public offering. But like Google, Twitter is much more than just its namesake service. In this case, it's about app development.For an undisclosed sum, Alphabet hasagreed to buyout Twitter'smain developer project - Fabric.7 Marvelous Mid-Cap Stocks to Buy for the Best of All WorldsFabric provides a software toolkit for development and design of mobile apps. And even though it's part of Twitter, it's not small potatoes. The software is used by more than 580,000 mobile developers includingAlibaba Group Holding Ltd(NASDAQ:BABA) andWal-Mart Stores Inc's(NYSE:WMT) Jet.com.Fabric will be folded into Google's own Firebase mobile developer platform, and its employees will be now part of Alphabet.So why would the company want this stuff and the talent pool? As I said, it's all about data.With the addition of Fabric, GOOGL will own two of the most popular tools for developing mobile apps. Fabric is a favorite stomping ground for app development forApple Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AAPL) iOS software for iPhones/iPads. By having the two under one umbrella, it gives Alphabet an easy inroad to help developers make formerly exclusive iPhone apps available for the mobile web and Google's Android software. You know, where GOOGL stock makes a bulk of its advertising dollars.The second big data kicker comes from the fact that while much of Google's tools are available for free; many developers will buy computing power and storage from the company's cloud service. It's expected that once Fabric is integrated fully, the deal would be the same. Not only does that boost GOOGL's cloud revenues, but it gives it a chance to comb through all the data being produced and potentially mine it for what it is worth.Backend as a service (BaaS) platforms like Fabric and Firebase fit perfectly into Google's ""Here, have it for free, we'll just keep the data"" business model.In the end, the purchase will allow Google to further cement itself as one of the world's biggest mobile app developers and give it a new source of additional revenue.Alphabet Still Wants BluebirdBut what about Twitter's real function - those juicy 140 character tweets and the social network? Even though Google didn't make an offer to buy the firm, the truth is, Twitter proper still makes for an excellent fit for GOOGL stock. Twitter has a hard time data mining and getting advertisers to embrace all those tweets. But for someone like Google, the social media network - and its 300 million users - is pure gold. Advertisers are starting to prefer social media networks and their ability to drill down to specific users.How Twitter Inc (TWTR) Stock Fooled the Suckers AgainThe idea behind Twitter selling off this hobby business was so that it could focus on boosting the main product's user base, remove spam/bots and make it a better product. Buy waiting to buy it later, all the hard clean-up work will be done. And if it is still floundering, it gives Alphabet a chance to buy it on the cheap. And considering that there will be now plenty of former Twitter employees at GOOGL, integrating it later on will be a snap.Bottom Line on GOOGL StockWhile it continues to be a perpetual rumor, Google's latest actions suggest that Twitter will very much be an Alphabet business in the future. The moves to strengthen its one developer base in mobile apps and snag key personal from the social media company is just the first step. It gives plenty of time for Twitter to refocus and reorganize. In the meantime, the additional revenue from Fabric and cloud sales will be certainly welcome.And when Google finally does buy TWTR, it'll be great news for GOOGL stock.

Google's Biggest Cloud Customer Just Signed a $1 Billion Deal With Amazon;2/12/2017;"It didn't take long for Google's biggest cloud customer to   split its allegiances. Just a week afterSnap(NYSE: SNAP) announced it signed a $2 billion five-year contract   with theAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) company, it signed a $1 billion   contract with Google's biggest cloud competitor --Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) .Snap will continue to use Google Cloud for the core Snapchat   functionality. The Amazon Web Services contract is for ""redundant   infrastructure support of our business operations,"" according to   Snap'samended S-1filing.The new filing also revealed Snap has been using Amazon for   nearly a year, so not much will change in the near term. But the   way Snap's contract is structured with Amazon, it could be   spending nearly as much on AWS five years from now as it is on   Google Cloud.makeArticleAd();It's worth taking a closer look at Snap's cloud contracts.     Image Source: Snap.A quick look at Snap's cloud contractsYearAmazon spendingGoogle spending2017$50 million$400 million*2018$125 million$400 million*2019$200 million$400 million*2020$275 million$400 million*2021$350 million$400 millionSource: Snap S-1. *Snap has the option to defer up to 15% of   the amount to the subsequent year.Snap uses Google for most of its heavy lifting today. That   might change in five years. While Amazon just provides redundancy   for Snapchat to ensure the app doesn't suffer significant   downtime right now, it could grow into a much bigger partner for   Snap. That's evident by the ramp in minimum obligations.Google still has a big advantage over Amazon. Snap built   Snapchat on Google's Cloud Platform. Transition to another cloud   provider ""would be difficult to implement, and may cause us to   incur significant time and expense,"" it said in its S-1. What's   more, Snap built Snapchat using the tools available on Google,""   some of which do not have an alternative in the market,""   according to its prospectus.But if Snap wants to expand to China, where Google doesn't   operate, it'll have to rework things on another cloud provider,   anyway. Considering the growing size of Snap's cloud spending,   Amazon may be able to offer tools comparable to what it uses on   Google to help facilitate a transition.Google's cloud business is minuscule in comparison to   Amazon's. Snap's $400 million per year contract very likely made   it Google's biggest cloud customer, and now Amazon's going to   steal away a good chunk of its business. That doesn't mean much   for Amazon -- its cloud business brought in $12 billion last year   -- but it means a whole lot to Google.What this means for SnapSnap is now committing $3 billion to cloud services over the   next five years. That's a lot for a company with only $405   million in annual revenue, even one growing as quickly as   Snap.At some point, it would make more sense for Snap to build out   its own infrastructure like other popular internet services.   Building infrastructure is capital intensive, but once it's   built, the company would no longer be as reliant on third parties   to support its flagship app. With Snap locked into contracts for   the next five years, it's unlikely we'll see it go that way   anytime soon, which means continued pressure on its gross   margin.Last year, Snap's cost of revenue exceeded sales. The bulk of   its cost of revenue was attributed to its cloud infrastructure   expenses, which climbed $192 million last year. As such, Snap   posted a negative gross margin, which is crazy for a company that   primarily produces software.By 2021, Snap will be paying at least $750 million for cloud   services. That will make it one of the largest cloud-computing   customers in the world. With that much committed to Google and   Amazon, Snap better get to work on growing its revenue.10 stocks we like better than Snap Inc.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

5 Things We Learned From The Wall Street Journal's Exclusive Report on SpaceX;2/12/2017;"By now you've almost certainly heardthe big news about SpaceX: Last month,The Wall Street Journaluncovered a treasure trove of internal   documentsfrom the company. These documents clearly demonstrate that   SpaceX is neither profitable nor cash flow positive any   longer.It's what you maynothave heard, though, that will really shock you: SpaceX never   planned to earn much profit from launching rockets in the first   place. Instead, SpaceX is placing its faith in a megaproject,   partially backed byAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) , to create a satellite broadband   internet constellation, which will encircle the globe, and (as   theJournalputs it) ""eventually dwarf [SpaceX's] rocket division.""Now, here are five more things you need to know about SpaceX's   secret plan for satellite dominance.makeArticleAd();Look! Up in the sky! It's not a bird or a plane -- it's how     SpaceX hopes to turn profitable. Image source: Getty     Images.1. Tiny satellites, huge profitsWhile most famous today for its rocket launches (and soon to   become famous for launching reused rockets, perhaps as soon as   this month), SpaceX sees rockets as only a small part of its   plans for future profits.According to internal documents dated from 2015, SpaceX hopes   to begin putting aconstellation of 4,425 broadband internet   satellitesinto orbit in 2018, and begin collecting revenue from it as an   internet service provider as early as 2019.2. Moving the needleThat year, revenue from satellites will be minuscule -- a few   hundred million dollars at most, and probably contributing   nothing to profits. Just one year later, however, in 2020, SpaceX   expects to get roughly equal amounts of revenue from rocket   launches and from satellite internet, about $3 billion each.   Profits are expected to leap to $2 billion -- 33% of revenue.3. Blasting offAnd this is just the beginning. SpaceX expects its revenue   from satellite internet to grow by leaps and bounds from 2020 on,   eclipsing revenue from rocket launches in 2021. SpaceX expects   that by 2022, satellite revenue will account for roughly 75% ofallrevenue the company collects, then grow to more than 80% in 2023,   and to 85% or more in 2024 and 2025 -- by which time SpaceX   expects to be regularlylanding astronauts on Mars.4. Planned obsolescence for rocket launches?You might expect that once SpaceX has begun its Mars   colonization project, the company would lose interest in the   workaday business of merely lofting satellites into Earth orbit   -- and you'd be right.SpaceX's rocket launch plans got knocked off track by its twin   SpaceXplosions in 2015 and 2016. But before those plans went   askew, the company had mapped out a surprising future for its   rocket launch program. Starting off from a base of zero launches   in 2011, SpaceX planned to steadily increase the pace of launches   through 2019. SpaceX had 27 launches slated for this year, for   example. That number would grow to 44 launches in 2018, and then   52 in 2019. But in 2020, satellite launch activity would suddenly   reverse course, and fall to just 41 launches.At the same time, SpaceX projects modest increases in launchrevenueeven after 2020. The logical conclusion is that by 2020, what few   rockets SpaceX is still launching will be bigger, and more   expensive, and will carry bigger, more expensive satellites, too   -- just not as many of them.5. A margin explosionSo what does all of this mean for SpaceX stock, and for the   investors who hope to invest ina possible eventual SpaceX IPO?As we explained last week, SpaceX's internal documents show   that even in the best of years, it has been only marginally   profitable, and is not profitable at all at present. Introducing   reusable rocket launches, as the company plans to do this month,   holds the potential to put SpaceX back in the black. But   significant profits -- the kind that can finance the colonization   of Mars -- will depend on the company's successful deployment and   operation of a constellation of broadband internet   satellites.Based on the numbers laid out above, SpaceX appears to be   targeting operating profit margins of 33% once its satellites   begin operating in 2020. Operating profits could total $4 billion   by 2021 (a profit margin of more than 40% on projected revenue of   about $9.5 billion). Margins will top 50% by 2022 -- then soar   into the mid-50s range in 2023, and finally top out at better   than 60% by 2025. At that point, SpaceX expects to be collecting   $36 billion in annual revenue -- almost all of it from satellites   -- and earning roughly $22 billion in operating profit. To put   that final goal in context, $22 billion inprofitis 11 times more than the $1 billion inrevenuethat SpaceX collected in 2014, its best revenue year ever.Logical conclusion:IfSpaceX can bring its broadband satellite internet project to   fruition, SpaceX stock could turn out to be a very profitable   investment. But if you're planning to invest in SpaceX, you need   to do it for the satellite business (which doesn't exist yet),   and not for the rocket launch business that does exist.10 stocks we like better than Alphabet (A     shares)When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

3 Stocks Begging for a Buyout;2/11/2017;"Sometimes mergers are necessary for survival, and at other   times, they simply just make good old-fashioned sense. In either   case, investors lucky enough to own stocks that do get bought out   can turn a nice profit.We reached out to our contributors, and asked them to tell us   what stocks they think could get bought. They settled onTwitter(NYSE:TWTR) ,GoPro(NASDAQ: GPRO) , andMerrimack Pharmaceuticals(NASDAQ: MACK) . Read on to learn if these companies are worth   owning in your portfolio.A stock good enough for a presidentRich Smith(Twitter):Remember how last year, the internets were all a-twitter with   rumors thatWalt Disney-- or maybeGoogle, or perhapssalesforce.com-- was going to buy Twitter? It never actually happened, of   course, but I think it might have happened -- and I think it   stillshouldhappen.makeArticleAd();IMAGE SOURCE: TWITTER.Second only toFacebookin internet mindshare, Twitter is the stock success story that   never quite made it. Twitter went public more than three years   ago at $26 per share, and almost immediately doubled in price   before investors began to notice a ""giant sucking sound,"" which   ultimately pulled down Twitter to its current price of   $18.50.You can blame Twitter's failure on any number of things: a   lack of profits, single-digit revenue growth, or zero growth in   its user base (as of last quarter). At the same time, with 320   million monthly visitors to the site, Twitter remains a force to   be reckoned with on the internet, and will only grow more   important as President Trump uses it as his social-media   trumpet.Other fans of Twitter may tout its usefulness for keeping   abreast of celebrity news, its deals with sports organizations,   or its efforts in live-streaming. But for me, the key is this:   Today, anyone who wants to know what's going on in the White   House, and even anyone who wants toopposewhat's going on in the White House, needs to be on Twitter to   stay informed. This single fact makes Twitter one of the most   important pieces of internet real estate out there today; if the   company's current owners can't figure out how to make a profit   off that, I'm certain there are other internet tycoons who have   the egos to believe that they can do better.Sooner or later, one of those guys is going to buy Twitter.   I'm betting on sooner.Will a buyout send this stock flying?Tim Brugger(GoPro):Now that the Karma drone is back, at least in limited quantities   in the U.S. (for now), some pundits have suggested that GoPro's   future relies on consumers getting back on board now that its   battery-latch issue has been resolved.Unfortunately, it's not quite as simple as that. As founder   and CEO Nicholas Woodman noted in GoPro's recently announced   fourth-quarter and 2016 annual results, its HERO5 Black camera   was the best-selling digital ""imaging device"" in the country,   along with select international markets, last quarter. And   GoPro's mobile efforts, which include its Quik app, are picking   up steam. But the primary concern remains: GoPro simply doesn't   have the product diversification it needs to weather an   unexpected storm.Woodman warned investors to not expect much in GoPro's fourth   quarter, and the reason behind his trying to mute expectations is   why GoPro is begging for a buyout. The problems started with the   aforementioned Karma being recalled ahead of the all-important   holiday shopping season, along with some manufacturing hiccups.   When one product miscue causes the poor results GoPro announced   on Feb. 2, on the heels of an equally disappointing third quarter   -- in which its revenue of $540.6 million was woefully short of   the $574.5 million expected -- it's a scary proposition.However, a buyout by a company that could add GoPro's camera   and drone to an already diversified product lineup: Nowthatwould make sense. And the timing couldn't be better for a suitor,   given GoPro's woeful 18% stock-price decline over the past   year.It's unlikely, but it could still happenTodd Campbell(Merrimack Pharmaceuticals):Instead of buying Merrimack Pharmaceuticals lock, stock, and   barrel,Ipsen(NASDAQOTH: IPSEY) bought Merrimack's only FDA-approved drug.   Ipsen's apparent unwillingness to acquire Merrimack outright   casts doubt that any suitor will emerge for the company,   especially now that it's sold its only commercial drug. But an   acquisition is still possible.Weighed down by a heavy debt load and commercialization   expenses associated with its pancreatic cancer drug Onivyde,   Merrimack announced a massive layoff last fall. The layoff gave   the company some wiggle room, but it wasn't enough, so the board   cut a deal to sell Onivyde to Ipsen for $575 million up front,   plus promises of up to $450 million in milestone payments.The company plans to return $200 million of the up-front money   to investors as a special dividend, and plans to retire $175   million in long-term debt. Management will also invest $125   million of the windfall back into its clinical-stage drug   pipeline.This deal gives Merrimack Pharmaceuticals a cash runway that   stretches into 2019; hopefully, that will be enough time for   management to prove that the remaining drugs in its pipeline are   worthwhile. Those drugs include MM-121, which is being evaluated   in non-small cell lung cancer, MM-141, which is being studied in   metastatic pancreatic cancer, and MM-310, a preclinical drug   that's expected to enter phase 1 trials this year.Undeniably, the company will be in better financial shape than   it's been in years, once this deal closes. But trial uncertainty   and ongoing expenses could make Merrimack Pharmaceuticals open to   entertaining offers from a suitor. If not, it might at least be   willing to cozy up with a deep-pocketed biopharma on one or more   of its remaining drugs.10 stocks we like better than Merrimack     PharmaceuticalsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

3 Top Stocks You've Been Overlooking;2/11/2017;"As much attention as stocks and investing get on an everyday   basis, there are loads of great companies that still manage to   fly under-the-radar. Whether it's because they are a small fish   in a big pond, a company without a lot of visibility for the   average consumer, or because they provide services that few of us   use, many of these low key stocks deserve a closer look.So we asked three of our contributors to each highlight a   stock that gets overlooked by everyday investors but should be on   their radars. Here's why they think that toy-makerHasbro(NASDAQ: HAS) , ratings agencyS&P Global(NYSE: SPGI) , andW.W. Grainger(NYSE: GWW) are stocks investors should be on the lookout   for.Image source: Getty Iamges.makeArticleAd();The toy maker with tight ties to DisneyBeth McKenna(Hasbro): A top stock many individual investors seem to be overlooking is   Hasbro, the toy maker behind such iconic favorites as Nerf,   Play-Doh,Monopoly,and Transformers, and newer hits, such as Pie Face. One   primary reason is likely its size: Hasbro's market cap of $11.9   billion makes it a large cap stock, however, it's a small fry   when it comes to more popular stocks across the market such asDisney($170.8 billion) andCoca-Cola($180.7 billion), also in the consumer goods realm, and Google   parentAlphabet($573.3 billion) andMicrosoft($490.2 billion) in technology.Those of you who are thinking that Hasbro's long-term total   returns relative to more popular stocks are probably a big reason   why it flies under some investors' radars might be surprised to   learn that Hasbro's return over the 10-year period, through Feb.   7, trumps those of all of the stocks of the companies listed   above. Moreover, Hasbro's return crushes that of its prime   competitor,Mattel, over this period.Data byYCharts.Hasbro should remain a top-performing stock. It has, arguably,   the strongest internal brand line-up in the growing toy   industry. Moreover, Hasbro has increasingly close ties toDisney-- and I can't think of a more powerful partner in which to   help it sell its toys. Hasbro has licenses to make and market   games and toys based upon several top Disney properties:Star Wars,Marvel, Disney Descendants, and Disney Princess   and andFrozen.The company snatched the lucrative latter license from   Mattel in 2016.Hasbro continues to fire on all cylinders. It recently   reported fourth-quarter and full-year 2016 results that trounced   analysts' estimates, with year-over-year revenue growing 12.8%   and adjusted earnings per share soaring 27.1% in 2016.Excellent business at an average priceJordan Wathen(S&P Global):S&P Globalis an overlooked cash cow. The company's core businesses of   software and intelligence services (which includes businesses   like Global Market Intelligence and SNL Financial), and corporate   debt ratings (S&P), each make up about 45% of revenue. These   two businesses are wildly profitable. Its ratings business   generated operating margin of 50% in 2016, while market   intelligence generated an adjusted operating profit margin of   34%.But incredibly, neither lead on margin. S&P Global's   smallest business by revenue, S&P Dow Jones Indices,   effectively earns a royalty on index funds and other index   products. That line of business, which makes up about 10% of   revenue, generated a ridiculous operating profit margin of 64%.   In all, more than $1 trillion of investor assets can be found in   an ETF or other index fund that tracks an S&P Global   Index.I believe its three major lines of business likely have a very   long runway of high single-digit revenue and earnings growth, a   reality that doesn't seem baked in to its average   price-to-earnings multiple.A behind-the-scenes business that cranks out huge   returnsTyler Crowe(W. W. Grainger):Companies that work behind the scenes in business get little   attention from investors. The fact that they are not consumer   facing means that they can easily be overlooked. One such company   that gets overlooked is W.W. Grainger. The maintenance, repair,   and operations equipment supplier has been cranking out high   rates of return, steady dividend growth, and consistent share   repurchases for decades, yet rarely is it discussed as one of   those must-own kind of investments.GWW Return on Equity (TTM)data byYCharts.What also makes Grainger a compelling investment today is the   large growth levels it can pull thanks to new sales channels. For   years, Grainger's business mostly dealt with helping with the   procurement process for medium-to-large sized businesses. These   were the kinds of companies that were large enough to merit a   customer support person on Grainger's end for sales. Now that the   company is building out an online sales platform, it can provide   better service to smaller businesses. This new sales channel is   producing 35% annual revenue growth with 50% returns on invested   capital.The one knock on the stock is that it isn't exactly cheap. It   currently trades at an enterprise value to EBITDA ratio of 12.6   times, which is on the high end of its 10 year historical   valuation. Considering the high rates of return it has generated   and its propensity to throw cash back to shareholders with   dividend and buybacks, though, it's a quality stock that may be   worth paying up for.10 stocks we like better than S and P GlobalWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Why Ford is Spending $1 Billion on a Tiny Self-Driving Start-Up;2/10/2017;"Ford Motor Company(NYSE: F) announced on Friday that it is acquiring a majority   stake in artificial-intelligence start-up Argo AI for $1 billion,   to be paid over five years.What is Argo AI?Argo AI is a new company, founded late last year by CEO Bryan   Salesky and COO Peter Rander. Both are big names in self-driving   circles: Salesky was the head of hardware atAlphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Waymo unit (formerly known as   the Google Self-Driving Car Project); Rander was a top engineer   in Uber Technologies' autonomous-vehicle division. Both were   previously at the robotics institute at Carnegie Mellon   University, where they worked on artificial-intelligence (AI)   technology.The plan for Argo AI is to use the founders' expertise in AI   to develop autonomous-vehicle software. The company is   headquartered in Pittsburgh. It's small now, but it expects to   have more than 200 employees by the end of 2017.makeArticleAd();Argo COO Peter Rander (left), Ford CEO Mark Fields, Argo CEO     Brian Salesky, and Ford CTO Raj Nair. Image source: Ford Motor     Company.What Ford said about the dealFord said that Argo AI ""is bringing together some of the most   experienced roboticists and engineers working in autonomy from   inside and outside of Ford."" An existing Ford team that has been   working on what Ford calls its ""virtual driver system,"" the brain   of an autonomous vehicle, will become part of Argo AI.While Ford will continue to develop its self-driving hardware   in-house, it appears that Argo AI will be responsible for much of   the software development. That software could be licensed to   other companies, CEO Mark Fields said, and it's possible that   Argo AI will go public at some point.""The next decade will be defined by the automation of the   automobile, and autonomous vehicles will have as significant an   impact on society as Ford's moving assembly line did 100 years   ago,"" Fields said. ""As Ford expands to be an auto and a mobility   company, we believe that investing in Argo AI will create   significant value for our shareholders by strengthening Ford's   leadership in bringing self-driving vehicles to market in the   near term and by creating technology that could be licensed to   others in the future.""Ford will hold a majority stake in the new company. Fields   wouldn't say exactly what Ford's ownership percentage will be,   but he did say that it was gauged to leave plenty of room to   provide equity compensation to new employees.Ford's global product chief and CTO, Raj Nair, and group vice   president of global strategy, John Casesa, will hold two of the   five seats on Argo AI's board. Salesky and Rander will hold two   more, and the fifth will go to an independent director to be   named later.Investors, take note: Fields said that Argo AI's spending and   results will be consolidated into Ford's automotive financial   results, primarily in the North America region.What this deal is really aboutHere's how I'm thinking about this deal: Ford just hired two   rock stars in AI and autonomous vehicles, put them in charge of   its self-driving software team, and structured the whole thing to   give the team members -- and very importantly, future hires, in a   field in which the competition for talent is fierce -- the upside   of a start-up with lower risk, because Ford's investment has   essentially capitalized the company and Ford will be its first   customer. It's an intriguing idea; it could turn out to be a   brilliant one.During a conference call for analysts and media, Salesky   emphasized that the structure of what he called the   ""collaboration"" between Argo AI and Ford would help recruiting:   New hires (and Ford's existing virtual-driver team) will go to   work for a start-up with significant potential upside, not   (directly, at least) for giant Ford.And while it's a start-up, Ford's involvement means that new   hires can be assured that Argo AI has both solid funding and a   major customer. The combination of relatively low risk with high   potential upside should make for a potent recruiting tool in a   field where the competition for talent has been extremely   fierce.The upshot: An intriguing move to boost Ford's technology   pushFor Ford, this is a way to bring some deep AI expertise into   its self-driving development project, structured in a way that   will help boost its recruiting efforts going forward. Nair said   that he doesn't expect the deal to ""accelerate"" Ford's effort --   he stuck by thepreviously announced 2021 deadlinefor Ford's first mass-produced self-driving vehicle.But there's a clear advantage to putting the team under the   leadership of Salesky and Rander, in a company that offers the   upside of a start-up with less risk than most. We'll have to wait   to learn more about the structure of the deal to evaluate it   fully, but right now it looks like Ford has taken an intriguing   step ahead.10 stocks we like better than FordWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

With Netflix-Sized Dreams, Facebook Hires MTV Executive to Create Original Content;2/10/2017;"Earlier this week, it was discovered that social media giantFacebookFBhas hired-or, really,poached-an executive from MTV to help create original video content.Mina Lefevre, a former MTV executive vice president, will join Facebook as its new head of development. She naturally made the announcement on herFacebook page, saying ""I have always been drawn to the idea of building something and the idea of being part of the team that helps build Facebook's original content ecosystem...well, that just seems like a dream!""At MTV, which is a subsidiary of ViacomVIA, Lefevre was the head of scripted programming, and working on hit shows likeFaking It,Awkward,Finding Carter,Scream,Teen Wolf,Nicole Byer,Mary + Jane,Sweet/Vicious, andThe Shannara Chronicles. At Facebook, she'll be overseeing the development of the site's scripted and unscripted content, as well as working with global creative strategy head Ricky Van Veen, who joined the company last year. Van Veen is also the co-founder of CollegeHumor.It's well-known that Facebook is dedicated to making video a central part of how users experience its site, whether on mobile or desktop. CEO Mark Zuckerberg even said during the company'slast earnings callthat Facebook is beginning to experiment with shorter, episodic videos to push into its News Feed. And, its Facebook Live feature has been a huge success for the company, especially after this past election year.And because of its success, Facebook has had to figure out ways to monetize this new source of revenue. Ms. Lefevre's hiring is both a way for the company to capitalize on this content, as well as keep its users engaged with the site. Creating original content that could compete with the likes of NetflixNFLX, Amazon'sAMZNPrime, and Google'sGOOGLYouTube would allow Facebook to sell ads in a whole new, uncharted area for the tech giant.Interested in the other top stories of the week?

Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Targeting a Triple-Digit Return;2/10/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIt has been a good, but volatile, ride forAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) shareholders in 2017. Now supports are once again firming up both off and on the price chart for GOOGL stock. And for shorter-term investors, a bullishly targeted butterfly is one way to position and capture a nice profit range with limited risk in lieu of owning shares of Alphabet.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockWhen it comes to large-cap tech outfits like Alphabet,political risksranging from China to net neutrality to immigration laws remain a question mark. But waiting on a resolution is like waiting on Godot.It may take a while. As well, those eventual outcomes could always prove beneficial to GOOGL.Of course, there are also the potential political supports, such as cash repatriation and favorable corporate tax cuts, to consider. Not only is passage of such legislation more popular and likely easier to push through Congress, it would certainly be a boon for Alphabet.What's more, GOOGL stock is looking great again after its recent earnings report. Bottom line,earnings missed but growth is back.With its Q4 results, Alphabet proved its business focuses outside the company's bread-and-butter advertising search revenues, are starting to pay-off for the company.10 Super-Safe Dividend Growth Stocks to Buy TodayFor one, mobile search and YouTube both showed strong results and helped with Alphabet's overall ""exceptional"" year-over-year sales growth of 24%.But newer investments are also coming into their own. The company's aggressive shift into hardware such as its Pixel smartphone,AI-enhanced Homeand virtual reality helped Alphabet grow its ""other revenues"" by more than 62% on sales of $3.4 billion.GOOGL Stock Daily ChartAway from Alphabet's overall bullish narrative off the price chart, GOOGL stock is showing technical support for a long stake by investors.Following a fairly stiff post-earnings bout of profit-taking from brief all-time-highs, Alphabet has managed to find support from a Fibonacci zone, key price pivot dating back to last February's high, as well as the intermediate-term, 50-day simple moving average.Looking forward, targeting the post-earnings high of $867 appears logical. At roughly 4% from current prices, but with no overt company-specific catalysts on the immediate horizon to push GOOGL shares aggressively higher, I like the idea of using a targeted long butterfly spread.GOOGL Stock Bullish Call Butterfly SpreadTiming is everything. This is especially true with options strategies as calls and puts are wasting assets. Ourlast discussion on Alphabet optionsis intimately aware of this, as a lower-risk, bullishly placed long butterfly literally expired one day and $1 dollar short of cleaning up.I suppose you could say the last trade got trumped.Nevertheless, in looking at Alphabet's options and given what has been addressed, the GOOGL March $845/$860/$875 is attractive.Hate Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock, But Love This TradeWith GOOGL trading at $833, the out-of-the-money and bullishly placed butterfly is priced for $2.20 per spread, or less than one-third of one percent of the GOOGL stock price. A maximum profit of $12.80 or return approaching 600% would occur if GOOGL rallied by 3.25% over the next month and landed on the sold center strike $860 call at expiration.The desired and very precise outcome for maximizing returns is not a high-probability event by any stretch. However, with its limited risk, profit range from roughly $847 to $873 and maybe the use of a 50% stop loss in the event profit-taking turns into something more ominous, a GOOGL stock butterfly looks well positioned for the situation.Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in any of the securities or their derivatives mentioned in this article.

Hate Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock, But Love This Trade;2/10/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsUnder a month ago, I wrote about howit wasn't too late to create free profitsfromApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) stock. The trade yielded almost $5 in pure profits. I gained $3 from my debit call spread appreciation and $2 from selling the naked put.makeArticleAd();Now Apple stock sits near its all-time highs making it difficult to recommend an entry point. Furthermore, other mega-caps likeAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN),Facebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) orAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG,NASDAQ:GOOGL) have more obvious entry points.So is it too late to set another long trade in AAPL? I don't think so; there is still time to set another trade using options for another potential run of free profits.Fundamentally, Apple stock still is a money printing machine with a rosy intermediate outlook. I have my concerns about its leadership though; I strongly believe that Tim Cook will ruin Apple, but not in the next few months. Meanwhile, and if markets in general don't suffer a sustained correction this year, AAPL should be higher through 2017.7 Marvelous Mid-Cap Stocks to Buy for the Best of All WorldsClick to EnlargeTechnically, AAPL has a few constructive points. First, it made a wide rounding bottom rejecting the last swoon.Also, I think that if Apple stock sets a new high it would invite more frantic buyers who were leery of the potential of another double top.The Trade:Buy the AAPL April debit $135/$140 call spread. This is a bullish trade for which I pay $1.40 per contract to open. If Apple rallies well past my spread, I stand to triple my money. The price I pay to open the trade is the maximum I could lose. Usually I like to lower my exposure. In this case, I want to sell downside risk premium to finance the purchase of my calls or more. It's difficult to do so near all-time-high levels, but not impossible.The Bank:Sell the AAPL Jan 2018 $105 put. This also is a bullish trade for which I collect $3 per contract to open. By selling naked puts I am committing to buying the stock at the strike sold if Apple stock falls below it. But even if that bad scenario unfolds, I would have bought the stock at a 20% discount from today's levels. This trade has a 90% theoretical chance of success.As long as AAPL stock stays above my put sold, any premium I collect from selling my debit call spread can be pure profit. So if price action becomes too bearish, I could sell back the debit call spread for a profit even if the price I get is lower than my entry price.Apple Inc. a 50% Dividend Grower Hiding in Plain Sight (AAPL)I am not required to hold my trades through their expiration dates.

Alphabet Inc. Takes Another Shot at Amazon With Home Control;2/10/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAlphabet Inc.'s(NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Home connected speaker takes onAmazon.com, Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AMZN) Alexa on its home turf. But what about Google's big advantage over Amazon in the smart home war - all those smartphones?makeArticleAd();Source: GoogleThe company has just begun rolling out Home Control, a new feature that lets Google Assistant control smart home devices by voice.However, at this point, Home Control - like Google Assistant - remains a feature that's exclusive to Google's own Pixel Phones.The Battle for the Smart HomeGoogle Home is a connected speaker with Google Assistant baked in. Owners can use Google Assistant on the speaker to answer questions, find music and control a growing number of smart home devices using their voice only.The device is GOOGL's answer to the Amazon Echo. Amazon's Alexa-enabled speaker has been a surprise hit and allowed Amazon to take a big lead in the race to become the smart home hub - despite the distinct disadvantage of lacking a smartphone platform to host its digital assistant.Google has Google Now and the new Google Assistant, whileApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) has Siri. Between them, the two companies have billions of mobile devices in consumers' hands, yet Amazon still managed to leapfrog them with its personal assistant hosted in a speaker, to build an impressive smart home lead.Apple's Siri can control HomeKit-compatible smart home devices using voice commands, and now GOOGL is rolling out asimilar feature for its Google Assistant, Home Control.Home ControlGoogle's new feature for voice control of smart devices isn't actually new. Anyone who owns both a Pixel Phone and a Google Home speaker already had a Home Control setting on their smartphone.10 Super-Safe Dividend Growth Stocks to Buy TodayHowever, as of yesterday, GOOGL has begun to roll out Home Control to all Google Assistant users. This amounts to all Pixel Phone owners, since Google Assistant remains an exclusive that third-party Android smartphones don't get.With Home Control, someone with a Pixel Phone gets the same voice control ability for smart devices they would have if they owned a Google Home speaker. They can use voice commands on their phone to change the temperature on their Nest Learning Thermostat or turn off the smart lighting in the room they just left.The Battle for the Smart Home Enters a New Phase (Sort of)At the start of this fight to be the company that becomes the hub of the smart home - the one who controls all those smart devices - the smartphone was it.Smartphones ran all the apps that controlled each of the devices and everyone owned one. With smartphones, the battle came down to iOS and Android, Apple and Google.Then Amazon disrupted everything with the Echo and Alexa. With thousands of compatible products and services, consumers have been snapping them up. Amazon sold out of the Echo at Christmas, afterselling nine times moreof the smart speaker than the previous year.Voice control is in. Having to poke buttons on a smartphone is out.Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Finally Fires Back at Apple With Android Wear 2.0However, Apple and Google are not about to cede the smart home to Amazon. GOOGL began its assault on Amazon with the Google Home smart speaker to directly take on the Echo and Alexa. With Home Control, it's bringing voice control of smart devices to the smartphone, leveraging its massive lead over Amazon when it comes to numbers. There may be millions of Alexa-powered homes, but there are billions of people already carrying an Android smartphone.Except, most of those people still won't be able to use Home Control. GOOGL has baked Home Control into Google Assistant, a feature that's been exclusive to its Pixel Phones since they were released last fall. With Google Home and now Home Control, Alphabet clearly has Amazon's number. The question will be whether Amazon gets Alexa into more third-party devices before Google decides to let third-party Android smartphone makers have access to Google Assistant.For GOOGL, the decision comes down to which is more valuable: maintaining a key competitive advantage for its own Pixel Phones, or giving up that Google Assistant and Home Control exclusivity to take a real shot at unseating Amazon in the smart home.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceNo, Apple Inc.

Nvidia (NVDA) Earnings: Why This Q4 Beat Was Really Important;2/10/2017;"Nvidia earnings (Shutterstock photo)It appears the only thing now strong enough to stop Nvidia (NVDA) stock from climbing higher are investors’ expectations. Thanks to the company’s advancements in cutting-edge technologies such as deep learning and artificial intelligence (AI), NVDA shares have soared some 340% over the past year, crushing every important index.As such, the California-based semiconductor giant had lot to prove Thursday. And with top- and bottom-line numbers that cruised by even the most bullish forecasts, Nvidia answered the call. But the shares appear muted, falling as much as 3% in the after-hour session. From my vantage point, this decline, which I consider inconsequential, is victory for Nvidia and its investors. I’ll get back to that in a moment.makeArticleAd();Let’s go though the numbers.In the three months that ended December, Nvidia reported net a income of $655 million, or 99 cents per share. On an adjusted basis, when taking out one-time gains and costs, earnings came to $1.30 per share, which beat consensus estimates by a whopping 30 cents. Fourth quarter revenue also beat, coming in 55% higher year over year to $2.17 billion. The Street was looking for revenue of $2.11 billion.The strong bottom-line beat was driven by record quarterly GAAP gross margin at 60.0%, the company said, while non-GAAP gross margin at 60.2%. When looking back at fiscal 2016, the company broke several of its own records, including full-year revenue of $6.91 billion, which grew 38% from a year ago.""We had a great finish to a record year, with continued strong growth across all our businesses,"" said CEO Jen-Hsun Huang in a statement. ""Our GPU computing platform is enjoying rapid adoption in artificial intelligence, cloud computing, gaming, and autonomous vehicles. Huang also added that Nvidia’s deep learning GPUs (graphical processing units) has made a breakthrough approach to AI, which can now help in early cancer detection, weather prediction and is helping to tackle challenges such as self-driving cars.All told, it is these breakthrough areas that continue to drive interest in NVDA stock. Admittedly, I wasn’t a believer until now. And while the tech battle has always been between Apple (AAPL) Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN) and Facebook (FB), those guys are not alone anymore.In terms of the 3% decline on these solid numbers? Nvidia is being shown the respect it now deserves. Even if the stock were to decline 5% to 10% — after a 340% one-year rise — it would still imply the momentum story is still in place. And Nvidia’s Q1 outlook for revenue to be $1.9 billion, which surpass Wall Street estimates of $1.88 billion, suggests it sees no signs of slowing down."

No, Apple Inc. Is Not Releasing the iPhone 8 Early;2/10/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsA report began circulating several days ago thatApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) may start production of the iPhone 8 early. Typically, when a company starts manufacturing sooner than usual, that points to an accelerated release date for a new product.makeArticleAd();Source: AppleIn this case, it seems unlikely the move will result in an iPhone release date before Apple's standard September launch.If not to get it on shelves sooner, why would the company want to get an early start on new iPhone production?The iPhone 8 Early Production Ramp UpApple has a pretty standard roadmap when it comes to new iPhone releases. With a late September iPhone release date, the company starts to ramp up production of the new model in late summer. However, this year it looks as though Apple may be breaking with tradition.According to a report from BlueFin Research Partners, there are indicators in the company's supply chain that point to an unusually early production ramp up for the iPhone 8. Quoted inMSN Money,the BlueFin report notes:""The most intriguing data points that we have uncovered suggests that Apple is ramping the next generation iPhones earlier than historical norms.""Why Early Production Won't Lead to an Earlier iPhone Release DateBefore anyone gets too excited about the possibility of an early iPhone 8 release, that scenario is highly unlikely.First, ramping up production in June means Apple will begin having stock of the new iPhones in warehouses by the summer. But no one releases a flagship smartphone during the summer months - that's a slow time for consumer technology news. People are on vacation and not only would an iPhone announcement not get the coverage Apple expects for its new product launches, with so many people away the line-ups at Apple Stores the company is hoping for wouldn't happen.3 Warren Buffett Stocks to Buy in the Trump EraAn early release would also reduce iPhone 7 sales. Now that production is humming on that model, Apple wouldn't want to kneecap it by releasing the iPhone 8 early.So Why Would Apple Ramp up iPhone 8 Production Early?It's become increasingly obvious that companies like Apple are pushing the limits of their supply chain and manufacturing partners with their latest smartphones. The new dual camera system, haptic Home button and other components led to a shortage of some iPhone 7 models at launch. Apple ramped up production in late summer as usual,but these issues caused delays.I preordered an iPhone 7 Plus, but still waited a month after the new iPhones went on sale before mine was available …Then there's the issue of batteries. Apple has had to face its own headaches withiPhone 6 and 6s batteries, but those problems pale in comparison to the nightmare rivalSamsung Electronics Co Ltd(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) has gone through with the Galaxy Note 7 and its exploding batteries.There's a lot riding on the iPhone 8 and Apple appears to be throwing all sorts of new features, cutting-edge technology and a completely new design at its 10th anniversary iPhone. Glass construction, wireless charging, an OLED display, virtual Home button and more. The company is even rumored to becharging $1,000-plusfor its new flagship, an unprecedented price for a smartphone.In addition, Samsung will likely be introducing its new Galaxy Note around the same time, and pulling out all the stops to make that phablet such a smash hit that everyone forgets about the Galaxy Note 7.Alphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) is also expected to release the followup to the worryingly successful Google Pixel Phone in the fall.Rather than ramping up for an early launch, it's far more likely that Apple is starting iPhone 8 production early in order to iron out all the manufacturing bugs early. Virtually all of the components will be new and Apple will undoubtedly be pushing the limits of manufacturing capability. Having an early start will ensure any issues are caught well before the iPhone 8 goes on sale, ensuring a smooth, scandal-free, launch. And no embarrassing issues for the competition to take advantage of.The early ramp up also ensures that even if things don't go smoothly at first, there will be plenty of iPhone 8 smartphones sitting in Apple warehouses in September, ensuring a record-setting launch.Should Under Armour Inc (UAA) CEO Kevin Plank Step Aside?Despite the apparent early production ramp up, don't expect an iPhone release date in the summer. But Apple's move does mean you should have a flawless iPhone 8 in your hands at the launch, instead of waiting weeks or months for supply to catch up to demand.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace12 Stocks That Will Live and Die by Donald Trump's Pen7 High-Risk, High-Reward Stocks to Buy NowThe postNo, Apple Inc.

Don't Overlook These 6 Incredible Amazon.com Numbers;2/9/2017;"Shares ofAmazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) fell more than 3% on Feb. 3 after the tech giant   posted mixed fourth quarter earnings and  soft guidance for   the first quarter. Revenue rose 22% annually to $43.7 billion,   but that  missed expectations by $980 million. The company   was hit hard by currency headwinds, which reduced its top line by   about $558 million. Amazon's closely watched AWS (Amazon Web   Services) revenue rose 47% annually to $3.54 billion, but that   also missed expectations of $3.6 billion and represented a   slowdown from 55% growth in the third quarter.For the first quarter, Amazon expects 14.1% to 22.7%   year-over-year sales growth, which missed analyst forecasts for   23.4% growth. But on a currency neutral basis, which excludes an   expected currency impact of $730 million, Amazon expects its   revenue to rise 17% to 25%.Image source: Amazon.makeArticleAd();Some negative reports about Amazon focused on those headline   numbers, but they glossed over many of the positive growth   figures. Let's take a look at six incredible numbers from that   report that investors shouldn't overlook.1. $749 million in net incomeDuring the fourth quarter, Amazon's net income rose 55%   annually to $749 million, or $1.54 per share -- which beat   expectations by $0.19. For the full year, its net income surged   over 300% to $2.4 billion.That incredible growth was mostly attributed to the rapid   growth of AWS' high-margin business, which gives Amazon much more   freedom to expand its e-commerce ecosystem with low-margin   hardware like its Echo speakers, loss-leading services like   Amazon Video and Prime Now, and logistics solutions like new   fulfillment centers and drones.2. AWS' operating margin of 26%AWS finished last quarter with an operating margin of 26%,   compared to 24% in the year-ago quarter. That margin expansion   indicates that AWS' massive scale is offsetting tough price   competition across the cloud platform market, which caused Amazon   and its rivals to reduce their prices throughout the year.3. AWS' annual run rate of $14 billionAmazon announced that AWS had achieved an annual run rate of   $14 billion, indicating that it maintains a commanding lead overMicrosoft's(NASDAQ: MSFT) Azure in the cloud platform race.Microsoft claimed that its ""commercial cloud"" had achieved an   annual run rate of over $14 billion last quarter, but most of   that total came from SaaS platforms like Office 365 and Dynamics   CRM. Azure -- which competes directly against AWS in the   IaaS/PaaS ""cloud platform"" markets -- accounts for a much smaller   percentage.Microsoft doesn't disclose how much revenue Azure generates,   but  combining earlier industry estimates and its reported   growth rate  over the past few quarters indicates that its   annual run rate could be around $3 billion.4. Over 1,000 new AWS featuresAmazon already serves massive customers like NASA, the CDC,   andNetflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) with AWS, but it's continuously widening the   platform's competitive moat against rival platforms like Azure   with new features. Amazon added over  1,000 new features and   services to AWS in fiscal 2016, compared to about 700 in   2015.It also opened eleven new AWS Availability Zones across five   geographic regions in 2016, bringing AWS' total coverage to 42   Availability Zones across 16 regions globally. That massive data   center expansion will help AWS reach more companies and   developers, all while supporting the expansion of its e-commerce   and digital ecosystem into new markets.5. Prime Video in over 200 countriesA big part of that digital ecosystem expansion is Prime Video,   the company's streaming answer to Netflix. Amazon has made the   platform a ""free"" perk for Prime subscribers and a stand-alone   subscription service that costs slightly less than Netflix.Like Netflix, Amazon is investing heavily in original content,   and popular shows likeTransparentandMan in the High Castlehelped it become the third largest video streaming platform in   the U.S. after YouTube and  Netflix last year, according to   research firm Sandvine. Amazon is also following Netflix's lead   and investing heavily in localized original content in key   markets like Japan and India, which could help  expand its   Prime user base worldwide.6. 4,000 new skills for AlexaAmazon also taught its voice recognition platform Alexa 4,000   new skills since last October. It noted that ""tens of thousands   of developers"" are building new skills for the platform -- which   powers the Echo, Kindle, and Fire TV devices -- and that it was   working with ""a lot of major companies"" to integrate their   products with that ecosystem.The expansion of the Alexa ecosystem is important, because it   can give Amazon control of users' connected homes via Dash   buttons, DRS-enabled appliances, and other connected devices. In   addition to boosting its e-commerce revenue with ""frictionless""   orders, that platform can process data through AWS and widen its   moat in the smart home race againstAlphabet's Google, which is trying to establish its own home-based   ecosystem around its Home smart speaker.The key takeawayAmazon's fourth quarter report was lumpy, but investors   shouldn't overlook these positive numbers. Analysts still expect   Amazon's revenue and  earnings to respectively rise 22% and   53% next year -- so its overall growth won't peak anytime soon.   Therefore, I believe that investors should take advantage of   Amazon's temporary swoon and pick up a few more shares for the   long term.10 stocks we like better than MicrosoftWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Snap, Inc. Is Also Spending $1 Billion With Amazon AWS;2/9/2017;"Earlier today,Snap(NYSE: SNAP) filed its first amended S-1 with the Securities and   Exchange Commission. Companies often modify their initial   registration statements leading up to their IPOs, prior to   issuing a formal prospectus. Prospective investors already knew   that Snap is a big spender atAlphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google Cloud, which it relies on   for its cloud infrastructure needs.Snap is unique in its continued use of third-party   infrastructure vendorsat the scale at which it is operating; most companies invest in their own infrastructure once they   grow to a point where it's warranted. To a lesser extent, Snap   also purchases infrastructure services fromAmazon.com's(NASDAQ: AMZN) AWS.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();In the amended filing, Snap provided some additional detail on   its relationship with the e-commerce giant.Always have a contingency planTo be clear, Google Cloud is still Snap's main flame, but it   never hurts to have backup. In fact, contingency planning is   absolutely critical when your entire service relies on   third-party infrastructure partners, and this is the role that   AWS will play. The deal was inked just yesterday, which is what's   triggering the S-1 amendment.In last week's version, Snap said: ""We are currently   negotiating an agreement with another cloud provider for   redundant infrastructure support of our business operations.""   That line was replaced in this week's version with: ""We have also   committed to spend $1 billion with Amazon Web Services over the   next five years for redundant infrastructure support of our   business operations."" Snap says an existing agreement with AWS   that was originally entered into in March 2016 was amended on   Feb. 8, 2017.That $1 billion commitment will slowly ramp up, starting with   $50 million in spending this year. That's a tiny drop in the   bucket compared to the $12.2 billion in sales that AWS did in   2016. Snap is on the hook to spend $350 million with AWS in 2021.   In contrast, the agreement with Google Cloud that was finalized   on Jan. 30, 2017 calls for a flat $400 million per year for five   years, with a little bit of leeway in shifting spending to   subsequent years (up to 15% in each of the first four years).Data source: Snapchat amended S-1. Chart by author.Combined with its $2 billion commitment with Google Cloud,   we're looking at $3 billion pledged between Google Cloud and AWS   over the next five years. Snap's cloud strategy of relying   entirely on third-party partners is risky for many operational   reasons, but that's an awful lot of financial pressure for the   start-up. In 2016, cost of revenue exceeded revenue, resulting in   a negative gross profit of nearly $50 million, and infrastructure   costs are the largest component of cost of revenue.Snap only recently rolled out its automated ad sales API in   October, which exited beta just a couple weeks ago. The company   will now need to ramp ad sales faster than its infrastructure   spending commitments if it hopes to generate gross profit in the   years ahead. And we haven't even started talking about operating   expenses yet, which totaled $473 million last year.Hopefully, that API works pretty darn well.10 stocks we like better than Snap Inc.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Twitter (TWTR) Q4 Loss Narrower than Expected, Revenues Miss;2/9/2017;"Twitter, Inc.TWTRshares are down nearly 10% inpre-market tradingfollowing its fourth-quarter 2016 earnings report. Twitter's adjusted loss per share of 3 cents was narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 11 cents per share. However, revenues of $717.2 million missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $737.7 million.On a year-over-year basis, revenues were up a mere 1%. This is the company's lowest gain since it went public. Revenue growth has been decelerating over the last several quarters.Moreover, advertising revenues were down in the quarter to $638 million from $641 million reported in the prior-year quarter.Twitter's user growth wasn't overly impressive, yet again. Monthly average users (MAUs) increased from 317 million to 319 million this quarter, up 0.6% sequentially. Year over year, MAUs increased 4%. Mobile MAUs were 83% of total MAUs. Average DAUs were up11% year over year.Quarterly Numbers in DetailsThe company posted non-GAAP earnings per share of 16 cents per share, flat year over year.Coming to ad metrics, there was a 151% year-over-year surge in ad engagements but cost per ad engagement was down 60%, given the shift to auto play video, which has lower cost per view compared to click to play.Mobile advertising revenues contributed 89% to total advertising revenue in the quarter. Data licensing and other revenues increased 14% to $79 million.Twitter earned nearly 38.6% of its revenues from international markets. International revenues rose 12% year over year to $277 million in the reported quarter. U.S. revenues decreased 5% year over year to $440 million.The company reported 12% increase in adjusted EBITDA to $215 million. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 30%, up from 27% in the year-ago quarter.Twitter, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS     SurpriseTwitter, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS   Surprise|Twitter, Inc. QuoteTwitter reported an operating loss of $143.6 million, which compared unfavourably with a loss of $67.2 million reported in the year-ago quarter.Balance Sheet & Cash FlowAt the end of Dec 31, 2016, cash and cash equivalents (short-term investments) were $3.77 billion compared with $3.49 billion at the end of Dec 31, 2015. For the year, cash flow from operations was $763.1 million and adjusted free cash flow was $444.1 million.OutlookFor 2017, stock-based compensation is expected to decrease in a range of 15% to 20% year over year while capex will be in a band of $300 and $400 million. Expenses are expected to be unchanged to decrease 5% year over year.For the current quarter, adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in a range of $75 million to $95 million while EBITDA margin is expected to be in a band of 17% to 17.5%.Our TakeTwitter has been a social phenomenon but somehow hasn't been able to leverage that success to boost user growth.At 319 million users, Twitter falls way behind other social media services like Facebook Inc.FB, which has over 1.8 billion users. Even Facebook's subsidiary, Instagram has over 600 million users. The complex nature of the service has been often considered as a major hindrance to user growth.Though the company has been working hard to bring about a turnaround, its efforts are yet to yield the desired results. Focus on Live video content, a flurry of live streaming deals, user friendly changes, measures to curb the trolling menace, and divestment of non-core operations, and layoffs, the company has been doing it all. But all these are yet to move the needle for Twitter.Twitter's standalone status has already been questioned last year with AlphabetGOOGLand The Walt DisneyDISspeculated to have shown interest in buying the company.

The stock moved a bit over 4% on the week. Still, BBRY's march away from hardware devices and towards software sales will pay off.

Snap Just Became One of Google's Most Important Cloud Customers;2/9/2017;"One of the many interesting details revealed inSnap's S-1 filing with the SEC is that it agreed to a $2 billion   contract with Google Cloud in January. The agreement with theAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) subsidiary spans five years with   relatively equal payments scheduled for every year.Snap has used Google Cloud since its creation, but had been   spending considerably less than the $400 million per year it's   slated to spend through 2021. For the first few years of its   existence, it spent less than $30 million per year on Google   Cloud. Last year, however, it started seeing its hosting costs   increase considerably, up $192 million for the year.Image Source: GettymakeArticleAd();Google's cloud service competes against the largerAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Web Services andMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Azure. A $2 billion infusion could help it catch   up to the competition.What does $2 billion mean to Google Cloud?Alphabet isn't exactly forthright with its cloud revenue. It   lumps Google Cloud in with Google's other revenue line item,   which also includes Google Play and hardware sales. In 2016, the   three categories produced $10.1 billion in revenue. Google Play   likely accounts for the bulk of revenue.The cloud unit had an estimated run rate of just $1 billion as   of the end of 2015, according to RBC Capital. Snap's new contract   likely makes it Google's biggest cloud customer.While Google has made several advancements in its cloud   services over the past year, so have its competitors. Microsoft   boasted that its Azure revenue increased 93% last quarter, but   Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss estimates the unit brought in   just $1.6 billion. Bernstein's Mark Mordler estimates Azure's run   rate at $3 billion as of last quarter.Meanwhile, Amazon just reported AWS sales topped $12 billion   in 2016. Sales surpassed $3.5 billion in the fourth quarter   alone, although that fell short of analysts expectations.Google still needs to diversifyThe growth of Snapchat has been a major boon to Google's cloud   services, but it's still actively seeking to pull customers away   from its competitors and take market share. The hiring of   cloud-computing veteran Diane Greene to lead the division has   helped the company attract numerous high-profile customers, but   there's still more work to do.On Alphabet's fourth-quarter earnings call, Google CEO Sundar   Pichai said, ""We have truly differentiated offerings in four key   areas: data analytics and machine learning, security and privacy,   tools for application development, and the ability to create   connected business platforms."" Snap can take advantage of at   least three of those four factors, so it's clear why it was   willing to lock down a long-term contract.At the same time, the contract is not exclusive. If Snap wants   to enter China, for example, where Google doesn't operate, it   could tap one of Google's competitors. Or it could build its   own servers.Snap recently hired Jerry Hunter from AWS, who ran global data   centers for the cloud-computing giant. In Snap's S-1 filing,   management notes, ""In the future, we may invest in building our   own infrastructure to better serve our customers.""If Snap continues to grow at the pace it has been for the last   few years, it may make economic sense for it to switch to its own   cloud infrastructure, which would be a huge blow for Google.What this means for SnapSnap is now on the hook for $400 million per year in cloud   costs. There is some wiggle room: The contract says it can   postpone up to 15% of expenses for a year, so it only has to   spend $340 million this first year. Still, that's a huge amount   for a company that generated just $404.5 million in revenue last   year.It also means that switching service providers will be   difficult, considering it would either have to eat the contract   as a loss, or leave at least some of its operations on Google   Cloud in order not to waste the money. That makes the economics   of building out its own infrastructure within the next five years   even costlier.On the flip side, analysts expect Snap's revenue to continue   growing at a rapid pace, approaching $1 billion this year fueled   by continued user growth and product expansion that will surely   put additional demands on Google's servers. It has plenty of   capital to cover the expense, and if last year's growth is any   indication of what to expect, it will need to spend at least $340   million on cloud infrastructure this year. The deal with Google   ensures that it gets the lowest rates possible, so it can to make   the most of its spend.Overall, it's not a bad deal for Snap, but it does tie the   company to Google for a long time.10 stocks we like better than Alphabet (A     shares)When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Theofficial announcementlanded yesterday afternoon on GOOGL's blog.7 Tech Stocks That Are Bucking the DowntrendWhat did Google engineers spend the extra time working on? It appears that they had several major goals: improving on the basic features most smartwatch owners use (such as fitness tracking), cutting the cord to a smartphone with LTE support, and making Android Wear 2.0 smartwatches as compatible as possible with the iPhone.Key features Google is showing off include:Improved fitness tracking with Google Fit appLTE support for running apps and making voice calls directly from a smartwatch without requiring connection to a smartphoneGoogle Assistant is integratedCustomizable watch face componentsGoogle Play access direct from smartwatchSupport for hardware control similar to Apple Watch digital crownIn particular, the ability for more apps to run independently on Android Wear 2.0 devices - with no need to be connected to a smartwatch - means iPhone users will get almost the same experience as Android phone owners. Assuming GOOGL can convince them to skip the Apple Watch.New Google Smartwatch Is From LGRumors had been flying that alongside the new operating system, the first Google smartwatch would make an appearance. That made sense considering GOOGL's push into branded hardware with the Google Pixel Phone and devices like Google Home and Google WiFi.Xiaomi Was Going to Rival Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock -- What Happened?However, the two new smartwatches unveiled as part of the announcement are from LG, in collaboration with GOOGL.The LG Watch Style is a relatively basic model. It lacks advanced capabilities like GPS (or even a heart rate monitor), but delivers smartwatch features in a slim, traditional wristwatch form factor. The round display is a 1.2-inch OLED screen at 360 x 360 pixel resolution and the watch has all-day battery life. It comes with a leather strap and for an extra $30, a Rose Gold color option.The LG Watch Style is the bigger and more capable device, fully able to take full advantage of all Android Wear 2.0's new features. The 1.38-inch P-OLED display has a crisp 480 x 480 pixel resolution. The round frame is stainless steel, with IP68 water resistance. There's a heart rate monitor and GPS for fitness, Connectivity includes Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, LTE and NFC for Android Pay. Battery life is rated for all-day, but use of features like LTE and the heart rate monitor can significantly cut that.They're premium devices, designed to take on the Apple Watch and GOOGL's involvement means they make the most of Android Wear 2.0. But they aren't the official Google smartwatch … well see if that comes later.Availability and PricingGoogle says Android Wear 2.0 will begin rolling out ""in the coming weeks."" Most current Android Wear smartwatches should be eligible for the free update, but not all watches will support all features. The LG Watch Style and LG Watch Sport will retail for $249 and $349 respectively and will go on sale in the U.S. starting Feb. 10.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceApple Inc.

Intevac, HP, Twitter, Facebook and Google highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day;2/9/2017;"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL - February 09, 2017 -Zacks Equity ResearchhighlightsIntevac(NASDAQ:IVAC-Free Report) as the Bull of the Day andHP Inc(NYSE:HPQ-Free Report) as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis onTwitter(NYSE:TWTR-Free Report),Facebook(NASDAQ:FB-Free Report) andGoogle(NASDAQ:GOOGL-Free Report).Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:Bull of the Day:Intevac (NASDAQ:IVAC-Free Report) recently reported a very strong quarter at the start of February. The company posted EPS of $0.13 when the Zacks Consensus Estimate was calling for $0.07. That $0.06 beat was good for a positive earnings surprise of 85%. That big beat put the stock on a lot of radar screen but it is the Bull of the Day for another, much more important reason.DescriptionIntevac makes vacuum deposition equipment for various thin-film applications, and digital night-vision technologies and products. Intevac, Inc. was founded in 1990 and is headquartered in Santa Clara, California.Growth And ValueGrowth investors and value investors are looking for different things and usually a good growth stock is not a value. IVAC posted revenue growth of 76% on a year over years basis in the most recent report. That followed growth of 23% in the previous period.On the value side, the company noted that book value at the end of the quarter as $71M, and with the stock trading at just under $200M in market cap we have a 2.8x price to book multiple. Usually, value investors are looking at stocks that have a price to book multiple of less than 3x, and IVAC fits the bill.Follow Brian Bolan on Twitter @BBolan1Why I Like ItThis stock is the Bull of the Day because of the tremendous increase in earnings estimates. Over the last five or so years of being at Zacks I don't think I have ever seen an estimate increase like this from a company as small as this.Bear of the Day:HP Inc (NYSE:HPQ-Free Report) has slipped to a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) with earnings just a few weeks away. This is not a good signal for investors that want to trade around earnings and it could extend the stock's losing streak to 3 - as in the number of times the stock has traded lower in the session following the report.HP Inc is part of the old Hewlett-Packard and is still a widely held stock.Earnings HistoryThe earnings history is pretty good of late, with a couple of beats of the Zacks Consensus Estimate and a few meets. On the top line I see only one miss in the last five quarters, so that too is a good thing to see.EstimatesHere is where we separate the pretenders from the contenders. Estimates for HP Inc have fallen of late, moving from $1.62 in August down to $1.60 at the current level. That doesn't seem like enough to merit a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) but then I looked at the next fiscal year.The fiscal 2018 estimate has slipped from $1.68 to $1.65, and again this is another small move.Going ForwardThis stock is a probably the ""softest"" Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) that I have ever seen. That said, a move to a #5 before earnings is not a good signal.Additional content:A Few Things to Know Ahead of Snap, Inc.'s Spring IPOSnap Inc., the parent company of the disappearing messaging app Snapchat, on Thursday, Feb. 2 filed its highly anticipated IPO.The five-year-old California-based technology company has evolved its business model in the last few years, and its user base is made up of the coveted 18-to-34-year-old demographic. But does Snapchat's popularity with American Millennials make Snap's IPO worth its estimated $20 to $25 billion valuation come March?The short answer: no one knows.Brief BackstoryTwitter (NYSE:TWTR-Free Report) went public in Fall 2013, and it has failed to meet the expectations of its similarly lofty initial valuation ever since. So, it might be best to temper expectations for Snap Inc. But here are some facts to help put the next big tech IPO into perspective.Facebook (NASDAQ:FB-Free Report) tried to buy Snapchat for $3 billion cash in 2013. Evan Spiegel, Snapchat's co-founder and CEO, turned the offer down. Since then,the social media giant has focused on competing with and mimicking Snapchatin the race to own the under-34 demographic online.Snapchat began as a disappearing picture and video messaging app. And it quickly became popular with young people. Over the past few years,behind an ever growing and loaded group of top executives, Snap has focused on user engagement, increasing advertising revenue, and innovation - its prospectus proudly proclaimed, ""Snap Inc. is a camera company.""Advertising DollarsIn the last two years, Facebook shifted its focus to video and live video, in part because it saw Snapchat's success. But more importantly, because that is where the advertising dollars are shifting.As young people shift away from regular linear television viewing, advertisers need new outlets to reach that coveted audience. Nielsen reported a 37% decline in the amount of time 18-to-24-year-olds watched TV between 2010 and 2016. And many reports indicate that a larger percentage of advertising budgets will be spent online by 2020.Snapchat has partnerships with the four major North American professional sports leagues, MLB, the NFL, the NHL and the NBA. The company also has content and sponsorship deals with major media outlets such as ESPN, CNN, and Buzzfeed. It also runs standard video ads spread out between users' content.The company still sells most of its ad space in-house.But Snap announced it updated its ad platformto allow marketers the ability to purchase ads in real-time through automated ad-buying technology used heavily by Facebook and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL-Free Report), and now dominates the space. This will give Snap the opportunity to increase its ad revenue - the key to its profitabilityUser BaseMillennials use the app, unlike Twitter or Facebook. Snapchat users send and post photos or videos that never last longer than 10 seconds. Time sensitivity has fostered massive active user engagement, which is key to its long-term profitability.A portion of Snap's IPO pitch focused on its ability to engage with the 18-to-34-year-old demographic. This focus is due in large part to the fact that Snapchat's user base and global reach is microscopic compared to Facebook.""If we fail to retain current users or add new users, or if our users engage less with Snapchat, our business would be seriously harmed,"" the filing noted.Yet, Snapchat users spend an average of 25 to 30 minutes a day on the app, while Facebook users, which include Instagram and Messenger, spend 50 minutes.Snap Inc. closed 2016 with 161 million daily users, and its average revenue per user rose to $1.05 in the fourth quarter from $0.31 a year ago. The company reported revenue of $404.5 million. Still, it reported a loss of $514.6 million, up from a loss of $373 million the year before.Facebook made $7 per user in the fourth quarter 2016 from its 1.2 billion users. The company reported revenue of $27 billion.Snapchat added 50 million daily active users in 2016. But user growth curtailed near the end of the year, adding just five million users in the fourth quarter. The company's offering last week noted that this was due to competition. One such competitor is Instagram, which now allows users access to similar disappearing video messaging features.Last quarter was Snapchat's smallest quarter-over-quarter user jump in three years.New EndeavorsSnap recently introduced its first product, Spectacles, in Fall 2016. The new sunglasses have video cameras that allow users to post directly to Snapchat. As of now, Spectacles aren't widely available.The company has grown its popularity through many unique and innovative partnerships. It recently partnered with the BBC for the release of the U.K.-based network'sPlanet Earth II. Partnerships outside of the U.S. will be key as the company tries to expand and grow Snapchat's user base.Snap is set to issue only nonvoting shares come March. Despite Snap's experienced leadership team, Spiegel and co-founder and CTO Bobby Murphy will maintain a vast majority of the company's voting shares when it goes public.Spiegel, 26, and Murphy, 28, currently hold roughly 90% of the voting shares. If either were to die, or become unable to perform his role, the other could control almost all of the voting power.Just Released - Driverless Cars: Your Roadmap to   Mega-Profits TodayIn this latest Special Report, Zacks' Aggressive Growth Strategist Brian Bolan explores a full-blown technological breakthrough in the making - autonomous cars.

What Is Unearned Revenue, and Why Should Amazon Investors Care About It?;2/9/2017;"A small line item onAmazon.com's(NASDAQ: AMZN) balance sheet has been growing rapidly over the   past couple years. Since the end of 2014, Amazon's unearned   revenue liability increased from $1.8 billion to $4.8   billion. Some investors might see a growing liability and   think that's bad news, but in fact this is very good news.Unearned revenue is simply cash customers have paid to Amazon   in advance for services it has yet to render. For example, Prime   members typically pay $99 up front for a full year of the two-day   shipping program. Amazon immediately takes the cash and puts it   on its balance sheet, but it amortizes the $99 of revenue over   the 12 months of the membership. So it accounts for only $8.25   per month in revenue per month for each Prime member. The rest of   the cash received for Prime is held in the unearned-revenue   balance.Prime growth has been very good over the past few years.   Amazon says it added ""tens of millions"" of new members last year.   But Prime isn't the biggest driver of unearned revenue. More   likely, Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the biggest factor pushing   the balance higher.makeArticleAd();Image source: Getty Images.Maybe last quarter wasn't so disappointingFor the first time since Amazon started breaking out AWS   revenue and income, the cloud-computing segment missed analysts'   expectations. Sales totaled $3.5 billion in the fourth quarter,   where analysts were expecting $3.6 billion on average.But unearned revenue climbed $568 million from the previous   quarter. That's unusual for Amazon's fourth quarter. Usually,   unearned revenue spikes in the first quarter as cloud customers   presumably re-up short-term contracts for the year.Most of Amazon's AWS customers are small businesses using its   pay-as-you-go pricing, which allows them to quickly scale their   use. The solution works well for companies with small or   unpredictable user bases.But a lot of AWS's money comes from the big enterprises that   spend hundreds of millions every year on cloud computing. For   those companies, with more predictable usage needs, Amazon offers   ""reserved instances,"" which offers a discount if customers pay up   front. Growth in reserved instances, or other long-term   contracts, may have resulted in lower revenue in the short term,   but it nearly guaranteed revenue in the future.Locking in customersAs the competition for cloud-computing infrastructure   continues to heat up, long-term contracts may prove invaluable.   Locking in customers for a relatively long term means those   enterprises will start optimizing their code so that it runs more   efficiently on the specific hardware and platform they're   using.Such is the case withSnap(NYSE: SNAP) , which uses Google's cloud. In its S-1 filing, Snap   says it built its app to use ""services provided by Google, some   of which do not have an alternative in the market,"" asRe/Code'sPeter Guagenti points out. Not only did Snap just agree to a $2   billion five-year contract with Google, but it's also going to be   hard for it to leave Google even after the five years is up.   That's excellent news forAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) investors., and not as excellent   for Snap investors.Ultimately, signing long-term contracts provides a moat   against the growing competition. Not only does it lock in   customers for the length of the contract, but it could also lock   them in longer if they become dependent on certain features of a   cloud platform. In that light, Amazon's fourth-quarter AWS   results look quite strong.Find out why Amazonis one of the 10 best stocks to buy nowMotley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more   than a decade beating the market.

Snap, Inc. Is Pioneering a New Cloud Strategy. Will It Work?;2/8/2017;"Amazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) may be leading the growing market for cloud   infrastructure, butAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) is still putting up a fight.Cloud infrastructure vendors have been crucial in enabling   smaller start-ups, particularly those that are building mobile   apps, to get up and running without having to worry as much about   the back end. It's an appealing model since it allows smaller   companies to simply pay for what they need without having to   invest in building the infrastructure themselves. In other words,   it's an OpEx model versus a CapEx model, andGoogle is betting bigthat the market is going to shift to the OpEx model in a major   way in the years ahead.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();But as companies grow, they often choose to invest in their   own cloud infrastructure. This gives them much more control over   their own destinies, reduces risk, and over time the cost   efficiencies improve after the large upfront investment.Social media peersFacebook(NASDAQ: FB) andTwitterboth operate their own data centers; Facebook announced itsseventh data centera few months back, while Twitter's infrastructure operations are   expanding more slowly, as it operates in co-located facilities.   Data centers are so strategically important to Facebook that it   helped create the Open Compute Project back in 2011, publicly   sharing Facebook's infrastructure innovations for the greater   good.But notSnap(NYSE: SNAP) .Hey, big spenderSnap primarily relies on Google Cloud for its infrastructure   needs. While this is entirely par for the course for mobile app   start-ups, Snap has grown to a size (nearly 160 million daily   active users) that would typically warrant investing in   infrastructure. The sheer scale of Snap's use of Google Cloud is   what's unprecedented here. The Information reports that Google   landed Snap with numerous discounts and other benefits, and Snap   very much relies on Google Cloud at this point, although it also   uses Amazon's AWS to a lesser degree.Back in 2014, Snap CTO Bobby Murphy said the company picked   Google Cloud over AWS because the company could scale better on   Google Cloud. Snap poached AWS' head of data centers in October   of last year, which is a peculiar move as it may imply that Snap   has longer-term ambitions to build out its own   infrastructure.But for now, Snap is firmly in bed with Google Cloud, and   spends quite a bit of money. Infrastructure costs comprise the   bulk of Snap's cost of revenue. From the S-1: ""Cost of revenue   consists primarily of payments to third-party infrastructure   partners for hosting our products. Hosting costs primarily   include expenses related to bandwidth, computing, and storage   costs."" Cost of revenue in 2016 was $452 million, and Snap has   committed to spending $2 billion with Google Cloud over the next   five years.But at what cost?In discussing its operating leverage, Snap believes that using   a capital-light business model will translate into ""lower costs   for us in both the short and long term."" That's definitely true   in the short term, but much more debatable in the long term.Having a larger proportion of fixed costs actually helps with   operating leverage as the business grows, since those fixed costs   get spread out over an increasing revenue base over time,   reducing total average costs. In contrast, if a company's cost   structure has a larger proportion of variable costs, those costs   will scale commensurately with revenue, so you don't get as much   margin expansion. It's already telling that Snap's cost of   revenueexceededrevenue in 2016 ($405 million), resulting in negative gross   margin.We saw this all play out years ago in the semiconductor   industry, with the rise of the ""fab-less"" and ""fab-lite"" models   that are dominant today. Building a chip fab costs billions of   dollars, which was a significant barrier to entry. Then contract   chip manufacturers came around and allowed companies to focus   more on designing the chips while the manufacturing partners   would produce them. By outsourcing production to a few large chip   manufacturers, the industry collectively saved billions and   innovation flourished. Semiconductors mostly shifted to the OpEx   model long ago, and there are only a handful of companies that   currently manufacture their own chips these days.Snap is wading into uncharted territory by relying on   third-party infrastructure partners at this scale. Whether or not   this proves right or wrong will also depend on how Snap grows   from here. One thing is for sure, though: Both aspiring start-ups   and infrastructure vendors will be watching closely to see how   this experiment unfolds.10 stocks we like better than SnapWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

If either were to die, or become unable to perform his role, the other could control almost all of the voting power.Just Released - Driverless Cars: Your Roadmap to   Mega-Profits TodayIn this latest Special Report, Zacks' Aggressive Growth Strategist Brian Bolan explores a full-blown technological breakthrough in the making - autonomous cars.

Amazon and Samsung Offerings Could Eat Into Google Search;2/8/2017;"Let me start by stating the obvious:Alphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google is the undisputed   champion of search. With over 60% of the US market and more than   90% of worldwide of worldwide search, Google is ubiquitous   and is not going anywhere any time soon. But even 800-pound   gorillas need to look around the room every now and then and see   what might be coming their way. From the looks of it, two fellow   titans are pushing products that might test Google's   strength.Google is the undisputed king of search. Image source:     Google.makeArticleAd();Bixby to bypass Google?Samsung acquires Viv virtual personal assistant. Image     source :VivLate last year,Samsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) acquired Viv, an artificial intelligence   company whose founders were the original developers ofApple'sSiri. With this purchase, Samsung joined the fray of thevirtual personal assistant. With several more years of development under its belt, Viv was   being billed as Siri's smarter sister that would work and play   well with others. In addition to the standard assistant chores   fare of language search, map directions, and weather, Viv was   able to respond successfully respond to extremely complex   questions and follow-ups, a skill lacking in other assistants.   With Samsung's acquisition, Viv was updated and reemerged as   Bixby, a virtual assistant which will make its debut in the   soon-to-be-released Galaxy S8. Samsung has plans to integrate its   recently acquired assistant into the majority of the native apps   on its upcoming phone.One of the more interesting features is the   camera featuring an optical character recognition system. By   pointing the camera at an object, and engaging the ""Bixby""   button, it seeks to identify said item and launches a native   search engine that circumvents Google search and locates the item   for purchase.There arepersistent rumorsthat Google has tried to prevent Samsung from making Bixby the   default on its phone, and it may find legal standing to do so.   Samsung phones use Google's Android operating system and the pair   have a non-compete as part of their patent-sharing agreement.Google may not want Bixby to bypass its search, though it   would not be the first such occurrence. Those familiar withAmazon.com's(NASDAQ: AMZN) failed Fire phone will recall a similar feature   -- Firefly -- that allowed users to take a picture of an object   and launch the item listing on Amazon's website. Amazon's phone   never gained any traction, so the fact that it bypassed Google's   search never resulted in any significant threat to Google's   search. The Galaxy S8 is unlikely to meet that same fate, even in   light of the the Galaxy Note 7'srecent difficulties.Consumers begin product searches on Amazon.comMore products searches start on Amazon than Google. Image     source: Amazon.comSpeaking of Amazon, astudyin June 2016 by PowerReviews found that 38% of US consumers   initiated a product search on Amazon versus 35% on Google.This   may be only the beginning. A largerstudyin September 2016 by BloomReach found that 55% of consumers begin   their search for a product on Amazon versus 28% on search   engines. The same report issued a year earlier reported 44% and   34% respectively. Amazon revealed that it is seeking to leverage   this and its massive library of product reviews by expanding paid   search, which will include not only products it sells, but items   not available on the site. This product and paid search will   extend to its virtual personal assistantAlexa and its Echohome systems. Few details have been released by Amazon, but this   will likely compete directly for Google's advertising   dollars. There is not yet any indication of a wider entry   into search, but with some estimates placing Amazon's Prime   membership at nearly half of US households, that might provide a   natural entry into the field.Those little things can add upGoogle is already dealing with lower costs-per-click as a   result of the migration from desktop search to mobile, with rates   falling 15% year over year in its most recent quarter. The   company was able to still grow the top line 22% in the most   recent quarter by making it up with volume, with aggregate paid   clicks up 36% year over year.Alphabet earns nearly 88% of all its revenue from Google's   search, and small challenges like these to its dominant position   could become legitimate threats to the company's cash cow   over time.10 stocks we like better than Alphabet (A       shares)When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock       tip, it can pay to listen.

Your Snap Shares Won't Get You Any Votes;2/8/2017;"One of the most interesting aspects ofSnap's(NYSE: SNAP) IPO filing is that the shares it's offering to the   public will have no voting rights at all. As a result,   co-founders Evan Spiegel and Bob Murphy will continue to control   a combined 88.6% of the company -- 44.3% each. ""Although other   U.S.-based companies have publicly traded classes of non-voting   stock, to our knowledge, no other company has completed an   initial public offering of non-voting stock on a U.S. stock   exchange,"" management wrote in its S-1 filing.Indeed, other companies have restructured their stock classes   so that a founder-CEO can remain in control. Snap is just being   more blunt about who's really running the show here.Image source: Snap.makeArticleAd();Most recently,Facebook(NASDAQ: FB) announced plans for a stock split so Mark Zuckerberg   could maintain control of the company as he gives away most of   his wealth to nonprofits and other causes.Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) also restructured its shares in   2014 to keep its founders in control. Snap is setting things   straight from the get-go.A simple look at Snap's voting rightsSnap has three classes of stock, and the voting rights are   laid out like so:ClassVotes Per ShareClass A0Class B1Class C10Source: Snap S1 filing.Individual investors will only be able to buy Class A shares   at Snap's IPO. The share classes do convert. One share of Class C   is convertible into one share of Class B. One share of class B is   convertible into one share of Class A. (No, you can't convert   shares the other way around.) As such, all shares of Snap stock,   regardless of class, will participate equally in the profit of   the company.How much is a vote worth?Alphabet has the same voting structure for its stock, with the   caveat that A shares have one vote, B shares have 10, and C   shares have no vote. Facebook announced it would split its shares   the same way at some point in the future.Shares of Alphabet provide the best look at how much investors   value voting rights. Class A shares, which provide one vote,   trade for a slight premium to the non-voting Class C shares. That   premium is currently about 2.5%.Alphabet A shares vs C shares. Source: Ycharts.So voting rights do represent some value to shareholders, or   at least potential shareholders. Activist investors could buy up   a significant portion of voting rights such that they can at   least have some sway at shareholder meetings. With Snap's IPO,   those shares won't be available to buy.Where things get messyFollowing the IPO, Evan Spiegel will receive an additional 3%   of all shares outstanding paid out quarterly over the next three   years as a bonus. Those will be Class C shares, and Spiegel will   then be able to exercise complete control over the company. In   the meantime, there's potential for deadlock votes between   Spiegel and co-founder Bob Murphy, as they each control   equal-sized stakes.But that's not the most concerning thing about the capital   structure at Snap. The only way for the founders to lose control   of the company is if they both die. As described in the S-1   filing, ""Either of our co-founders' shares of Class C common   stock will automatically convert into Class B common stock, on a   one-to-one basis, nine months following his death."" If that   happens, the other co-founder will have a controlling share of   the votes.In other words, both founders could leave the company but   still be able to exercise control over it.Facebook made provisions to its stock split to ensure that   Zuckerberg would only control the company's voting rights as long   as he remained CEO.There's a provision on Alphabet's Class B shareholders that   for every Class C non-voting share they sell, they must convert   one Class B share into a Class A share, and presumably sell that   as well. That makes it more difficult for the founders to retain   complete control. In fact, their combined percentage of the   shareholders' vote has fallen from 61% at the time of the stock   split to about 57% today.Snap's structure makes it so that not only do individual   investors have no voting rights, but the founders will continue   to control the company until both of them die. That's putting a   lot of trust in the founders, adding more risk to an already   risky investment.10 stocks we like better than Alphabet (A   shares)When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Priceline Inks Deal to Buy Momonndo Group, Eyes Europe;2/8/2017;"The Priceline Group Inc.PCLNyesterday announced that it has reached a deal to acquire Momondo Group from Boston-based private equity firm Great Hill Partners.Over the last one year, the stock has outperformed the ZacksElectronic Commerceindustry. It has gained 64.17% compared with the industry's gain of 57.95%.Momondo Group operates momondo, a travel meta engine that provides hotels flights and car rentals and Cheapflights, a global flight comparison and travel deals publishing platform. Great Hill Partners invested $130 million in the company in 2014 and acquired a majority stake.As a part of the cash deal, Priceline will buy all outstanding shares of Momondo for $550 million. Momondo will be absorbed into Priceline's travel meta brand, KAYAK. The deal, subject to regulatory approval, is expected to be completed by the end of this year.Momondo Group is Priceline's largest acquisition after OpenTable, which it acquired for $2.6 billion in 2014.Focus Shifts to EuropePriceline generates the bulk of its business from international markets where growth prospects are greater than in the domestic market. According to PhoCusWright, online travel booking in Europe is growing at a faster rate than in the U.S.Since Priceline is very strongly positioned here it will be able to benefit from increasing penetration rates through Momondo.

Snap IPO: Millennials Love It, Should Investors?;2/7/2017;"After months of anticipation,Snap(NYSE: SNAP)  finally made its publicS-1 filingwith the SEC. Form S-1 is used to register securities with the   SEC and provides prospective investors the first glimpse at a   company's financials and other data the company wishes to   disclose. Snap's S-1 has the standard balance sheet and income   and cash flow statements, but it includes a lot of juicy details,   as well.Image source: Snap, Author.makeArticleAd();We already know millennials love Snapchat, and management made   sure to highlight that fact. But should investors be equally   enamored with the highly anticipated IPO?Key financialsMetric/Year20152016Revenue$58.7 million$404.5 millionNet income($372.9 million)($514.6 million)Free cash flow($325.8 million)($677.7 million)Snap S-1 SEC filing.Snap is considered a growth company, and as such, its main   focus is on improving its top line. To that end, it managed to   increase revenue to $404.5 million last year from $58.7 million   the year before. That growth was fueled by an increase in the   total number of ads shown per user, as well as an increase in   total users. Snap introduced several new ad formats on Snapchat   last year and opened an application program interface (API),   which made it easier for more companies to buy ads.But that revenue growth came at a price. Snap invested heavily   in new research and development to create new ad products, as   well as sales teams to sell those ads. Snap also experienced a   148% increase in its cost of revenue, mostly related to hosting   costs it pays toAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) for its cloud platform. (It also   announced plans to spend even more with Google over the next five   years.)The result was a widening net loss. The company lost $514.6   million last year, 38% more than its $372.9 million loss in   2015.Snap also believes free cash flow is an important financial   metric since its reliance on Google's servers means it doesn't   incur huge capital expenses likeFacebookorTwitter, which own their own servers. Snap burned through $677.7 million   last year, up from $325.8 million in 2015.User growth and engagementSnap focused on daily active users in its filing, noting that   it's the most useful perspective of its business. Over the last   year, daily average users (DAUs) increased 48%, to 158 million.   The company noted it averaged 161 million DAUs in the month of   December, but it will use a quarterly average when it reports   results in the future.Source: Snap S-1.Snapchat's user growth has notably slowed over the last few   quarters, and Snap expects user growth to continue slowing.   Investors expecting Snapchat to reach any size resembling   Facebook will be disappointed.Snapchat's users are highly engaged, however. The company   notes the average user opens the app 18 times per day and spends   between 25 minutes and 30 minutes per day in the app.Over 2.5 billion Snaps are created every day. That compares   with Facebook, which says its users spend 50 minutes per day   between Facebook, Instagram, and Messenger. Twitter users spend   considerably less time in its app -- Comscore estimated just one   minute per user last year.That strong engagement implies that Snap has room to improve   its average revenue per user. Last quarter, Snapchat's ARPU was   just $1.05, $2.15 in North America. By comparison, Facebook   generated $4.83 per monthly user globally and $19.81 per user in   the U.S. and Canada.Even Twitter managed to produce $2.33 per global monthly user   in the fourth quarter last year. Considering Snapchat ads are   generally considered high value, there's a lot of room for   improvement in monetization of the existing user base.Should you buy it?Snap represents a very risky investment. It's going up against   stiff competition from Facebook, which is unabashedly copying its   main stories feature in Instagram. Its user growth is slowing as   a result. Users are also heavily concentrated in a few areas,   which Snap spins as a positive by saying it has a large presence   in some of the largest advertising markets. For most advertising   companies, however, breadth is the name of the game.Snap's also heavily dependent on Google Cloud for its   infrastructure, which will continue to cut into its gross income.   Management even lists potential disruption of Google Cloud as a   risk factor in the S-1 filing.Still, its revenue growth is exciting. The $405 million it   generated last year surpassed its internal expectations according   to a leaked document early last year. Analysts expect revenue to   reach nearly $1 billion this year, and its execution last year is   an encouraging sign that it can reach those expectations.   Snapchat's ad products are extremely compelling and unique   (although Facebook is doing its best to copy it), and it has the   young audience brand that advertisers covet.Ultimately, an investment in Snap at its IPO is an investment   in Evan Spiegel, the visionary CEO that's led numerous product   innovations at Snapchat. The S-1 filing also reveals that he's   done extremely well in acquiring technology and talent to support   Snapchat's growth.For investors willing to take on significant risk and who   believe in the vision and abilities of Evan Spiegel as a CEO,   Snap could make an interesting investment.10 stocks we like better than SnapchatWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Can Ubiquiti’s Run Continue in 2017?;2/7/2017;"While many technology investors no doubt enjoyed major gains   in the high-profile large-cap tech names in 2016, mid-cap   wireless companyUbiquiti Networks(NASDAQ: UBNT)  also had itself quite a year, rocketing 125%   in just the past 12 months. The company continues to fly under   the radar, despite having 38-year-old CEO who not only owns the   Memphis Grizzlies but can alsodunk a basketball.Take that, Zuckerberg and Musk!In its most recent quarter ended Sept. 30, revenues grew 35%,   and non-GAAP EPS grew a whopping 55% year over year, largely on   the strength of the Unifi segment. With the recent move in the   stock, investors may be wondering if they've missed the boat, but   I think the momentum can continue in 2017 for the following   reasons.makeArticleAd();IMAGE SOURCE: UBIQUITI NETWORKS, INC.Unifi goes up the value chainAs I mentioned, the star of 2016 for Ubiquiti was Unifi, which   grew 75% in the September quarter. This segment makes low-cost   enterprise hardware products, such as wireless access points,   switches, routers, security cameras, and VOIP phones, along with   software that allows IT professionals to track large networks   from a single user interface. Ubiquiti's low-cost business model   -- the company employs almost no sales force or service   professionals, and hires a limited number of ""all-star"" engineers   -- enables it to produce solid wi-fi products at rock-bottom   prices, and the product line caught fire in 2016. In January,   however, the company unveiled a new line of advanced products   aimed at higher-end customers, which is the turf of IT giants   such asCisco(NASDAQ: CSCO) andHP(NYSE: HPE) . The new products included the US-16-XG Switch for   $599 and a new Wave 2 access point for $349. These are much   higher price points than traditional Unifi products, but still   much lower than high-end access point vendors such as   Cisco's Meraki ($1,399), HP's Aruba ($1,395) andBrocade's(NASDAQ: BRCD) Ruckus ($1,295). Should Ubiquiti make inroads   into higher-end deployments, these new products could drive   Ubiquiti's already-sky-high 35% operating margin even higher.Ubiquiti looks as if it is finally making its move to disrupt   legacy IT players, just as prominent venture capitalist (and   former Ubiquiti board member) Bill Gurley predicted in 2014:""The fact that Cisco has never had a price disruptor over 30     years seems to violate the rules of the ""Innovator's Dilemma.""     I think many people believe that a disruption from underneath     is overdue. If I had to bet on anyone pulling that off it would     be [Ubiquiti CEO] Robert [Pera].""Airmax refreshWhile Unifi was the star of 2016, Ubiquiti's biggest segment   is still Service Provider, which accounts for 59% of total   revenues. Under the Airmax and Airfiber brands, this segment   makes high-powered radios that beam Wi-Fi over long distances   while achieving cable-like speeds. These radios are the building   blocks for Wireless Internet Service Providers (WISPs) in rural   and emerging markets worldwide, where fiber or satellite is too   expensive, and the spectrum is less cluttered. Airmax growth had   stalled in the past two years from its hyper-growth period a few   years ago, yet still grew 15% year over year in the September   quarter.There are reasons to think that 2017 could bring a   reacceleration for Airmax and its associated products. First,   Ubiquiti dropped the ball somewhat when it initially released   Airmax AC, as these hyper-fast products were not   backwards-compatible with older Airmax M radios. That meant   service provider customers would have to refresh their entire   networks of radios in order to upgrade, as opposed to upgrading   radio-by-radio. This was fixed in December with the release of   new firmware AirOS 8.0, which was no small task (it took over a   year!). Second, Pera recently revealed several new Airmax   products for 2017, including a GPON fiber product. While   Ubiquiti's radios are normally used to replace fiber, Ubiquiti   found out that many of its emerging-market customers can lay   fiber along power lines very cheaply, and this new product should   add to their arsenals. Even more exciting, the company revealed   an entirely new ASIC (application-specific integrated chip) it   has developed called LTU. As Pera explained:""It's been well over 3 years in the making, and we're going     to launch it next year. And it's going to be essentially     airFiber multipoint. But it's going to be light-years ahead of     anything in the market, and at cost points relevant to airMAX,     we're going to price it higher. The margins are going to be a     lot better... we think that's going to be a really big     differentiator in the market.""Again, we see Ubiquiti making a move to grow out of its   reputation as just a low-cost vendor, and into a company that   sells higher-quality (and, therefore, higher-margin) products as   well.AmplifiWhile Pera & Co. are at it, why not enter a completely new   customer segment? That's what Ubiquiti did this summer with the   introduction of Amplifi, a consumer router that will take onNetgear's(NASDAQ: NTGR) Orbi andGoogle's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) home router. Amplifi is gettingstellar reviewsso far, and just like Unifi's access points, it might pave   the way for other ancillary products for the connected home.Even though the Amplifi was unveiled last summer, it hasn't   produced much revenue for Ubiquiti yet. This is not because the   product wasn't great, but because the company was   capacity-constrained for the last half of 2016. As Pera said:""What I'm really, really, really frustrated about, is we     didn't execute on the production side. So we had demand for     tens of thousands of units out of the gate, and we've just been     slow to get these out.""That is what I'd call having ""champagne problems."" And while   Ubiquiti is going up against strong competitors such as Google,   Netgear, and others, the price-performance characteristics of the   product, as well as the secular tailwind of the connected home   makes me a believer that Amplifi could become a meaningful growth   driver as early as this year.The valuation is still reasonableEven after Ubiquiti's big move, the stock trades at a fairly   reasonable 23 times trailing earnings, which means the market is   pricing in decent, though not spectacular, growth from here.   Still, with a disruptive business model, a rock-solid balance   sheet, and a long runway in a secular growth industry, I think   Ubiquiti's stock can exit 2017 a good deal higher than where it   entered.Offer from the Motley Fool: The 10 best stocks to buy       nowMotley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent     more than a decade beating the market.

3 Stocks to Buy for Their Coming Rebound;2/7/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsEarning season can be either a nightmare or blessing for investors - or an ideal opportunity for those sitting on the sidelines to pick up a beaten up stock at an attractive price.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockGranted, there is a reason why stocks end up beaten up during earnings season. InFitbit Inc's(NYSE:FIT) case, the companypre-announceda horrendous fourth quarter.Mattel, Inc.'s(NASDAQ:MAT) salessufferedfrom a Christmas retail season slowdown whileUnder Armour Inc(NYSE:UAA)signaled to the marketthat it won't be growing at the rate it previously expected.All three of these stocks are now trading at multiyear lows or even all-time lows, but investors with an appetite for some risk in their portfolio could take advantage of these down-but-not-out stocks.9 Best Cheap Stocks to Buy Now Under $9.99So, here 's a look at why these beaten-down names are three stocks to buy for their coming rebound.Rebounding Stocks to Buy: Fitbit (FIT)Source:Via FitbitAs a long-term Fitbit shareholder, I was quite shocked when the company came out with a nasty pre-announcement which sent shares tumbling to new all-time lows. It has lost roughly 63% in the past year.The obvious question is, now what.With a market cap around $1.3 billion, investors could start hypothesizing that an acquisition in the works. Assuming Fitbit's cash and cash equivalents balance of $284.2 million (as of October 1, 2016) remains roughly unchanged, then Fitbit's enterprise value is barely $1 billion.This is a small price to pay for a fitness tracking company thatwas as of December(and likely remains) the clear and undisputed leader in the group.Rebounding Stocks to Buy: Mattel (MAT)Source:Horantheworld via Flickr (Modified)Mattel's unusual earnings miss sent the stock tumbling to around $25, leaving it at a loss of 18%-plus over the last year.The reason for the massive miss? The holiday selling season in both the U.S. and the international market was weak, and the holidays are when abouthalf of all toys are sold.No one is making excuses or trying to diminish the severity of the poor report but investors looking at the positive signs and willing to sit on MAT stock for some time could be rewarded over the long-term - and collect a near-6% dividend yield at the same time.Here are some of the positives that reaffirm the long-term story.The core Barbie brand which boasts impressive incremental margins saw its revenue grow 9% (constant currency) for the full year, although sales were down in Q4.Sales of Fisher-Price, the company's biggest brand, realized a 2% (constant currency) growth in the quarter.The Wheels brand (Hot Wheels, Matchbox, Tyco R/C) saw an 18% sales increase (constant currency) on the quarter.Mattel is now led byformer Google exec Margaret Georgiadis, who was recently named as CEO.7 Tech Stocks With Explosive Growth PotentialHer tech-savvy experience - not to mention coming in from an outside entity - could be just what is needed for MAT stock moving forward.Rebounding Stocks to Buy: Under Armour (UAA)Source: ShutterstockThe sentiment surrounding Under Armour has been poor, and any miss in its fourth-quarter print would send shares lower. However, the top-and-bottom miss was also coupled with a poor 2017 guidance and a surprising management change, which resulted in the stock plunging around 25%.But how much worse can it get? In short, there really isn't much more that can go wrong.Q4 gross margins fell to 44.8% from 48% a year ago and 2017's gross margins are expected to fall from 2016's level. We can cross gross margin erosion off our list of concerns for 2017 because weknowit will happen.UAA stockr guided its 2017 operating income to be lower on a year-over-year basis. Similarly, we can scratch this off our list of concerns for 2017 because we know it will happen.And we can also scratch off the sudden departure of a key executive, as Under Armour's CFO Chip Molloy announced he will be leaving the company.And the fact remains that Under Armour's wide variety of products is still in high demand, and there is plenty of room to grow.All UAA stock needs to do is beat the lowered bar for 2017, which some analysts believe is conservative. There is a lot going on Under Armour's favor, including a new partnership with retailerKohl's Corporation(NYSE:KSS) and the large international opportunity, which the company isn't losing its sights on.As of this writing, Jayson Derrick did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.The post3 Stocks to Buy for Their Coming Reboundappeared first onInvestorPlace."

GM's Race To Win Self-Driving Car War Provides Long-Term Opportunity;2/7/2017;"Like Tesla (TSLA), Google (GOOG,GOOGL) spinoff Waymo, Ford (F) and a host of others, General Motors (GM) is going full-force in the race to be the leader in autonomous cars.A new study shows that it's further along than previously thought, which is a good sign for investors, even if they're not happy with the company's fourth-quarter results.The California Department of Motor Vehicles released a number ofreportsearlier this month from various automakers and tech companies on what they're doing as it relates to self-driving cars and GM, long thought to be ceding the race, has vaulted its position, thanks to acquisitions and heavy spending.makeArticleAd();Cruise Automation, which GMboughtfor more than $1 billion in March 2016, is using a bunch of Chevrolet Bolt EVs to test its software and its cars out in the field. Cruise now has more than 20 vehicles licensed in California, up from just two in early 2016, when it was using a couple of Nissan Leafs.This is a bright sign for the Mary Barra-led company, as it looks to own the entire ecosystem of the next version of the automobile, instead of ceding the race to others.It's likely to keep dealing further into in this area, whether it'spartnering with Lyftor adding engineers to its self-driving car fleet in order to keep testing and building cars inDetroit.Projects like this are likely to help shareholders in the long-run, even if it impacts spending in the interim.In the fourth-quarter, GM earned $1.28 a share on $43.91 billion, ahead of estimates $1.17 a share on $41.53 billion in sales. Despite the earnings beat, investors sent shares lower on concerns of a slowdown in auto sales for 2017, as well as the potential for elevated inventory levels.It's unclear what impact, if any, self-driving cars are likely to have to vehicle volumes in the future. There may be a need for less cars, since they could be working more efficiently. Or there may be a need for a massive resurgence in sales, as costs come down and regulators incentivize manufacturers to make transportation safer.It's just a huge unknown at this point.GM has been building and manufacturing cars for over 100 years, giving it a leg up, at least in terms of the manufacturing process, over any of its Silicon Valley competitors. This is something that Barra has consistently cited as an advantage.“We have 100 years of really understanding vehicles, putting them on the road, making sure we have a safe, high-quality vehicle,” Barra told reporters at a December press conference. “When you take autonomous, electrification, connectivity, I think we are going to have a very special offering to the consumer.”The world is still a ways away fromLevel 5 autonomy(true autonomy, in which a car can drive by itself in any condition anywhere without any help from a human), so the self-driving car race is far from over.But it looks like GM, which has notoriously been secretive about its operations, is a lot further along than anyone thought. And that's something shareholders can rest easy about."

Twitter Inc (TWTR) Stock May Get Snapped After Earnings;2/7/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsInvestors have been getting bullish withTwitter Inc(NYSE:TWTR), as the stock has climbed about 13% so far on the year. As usual, there have been the various buyout rumors, which have probably accounted for quite a bit of the gain.makeArticleAd();Source:Andreas Eldh via FlickrYet might all this be another example of over eagerness with Twitter stock? Perhaps there will just be more disappointment when the company reports its earnings on Thursday?Well, the good news is that the bar is not set too high. The Street is expecting for Twitter earnings to come to 12 cents a share (on an adjusted basis) and revenues to hit $740.1 million.By comparison,last yearthe company reported profits of 16 cents a share and a top-line of $710 million.In other words, the consensus is for the revenues to grow by a mere 4.2%, which would represent the slowest ramp since TWTR became a public company. To put this into perspective,Facebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB)generateda massive $8.6 billion in revenues in Q4, up a sizzling 53%. So is it any wonder that Twitter stock has been mostly a bad investment?7 Tech Stocks With Explosive Growth PotentialOf course not.Now, in terms of the quarter, TWTR stock could benefit from some catalysts. Some of those include the impact of the holiday season as well as the wild presidential election and the live-streaming of NFL games.But such things will likely be temporary for Twitter stock. The fact is that the lackluster user growth will probably continue to weigh on the company. For example, Cantor's Youssef Squali isforecastingonly a 2 million net monthly active user increase in the base to 319 million, up 4.6%. This would be roughly the same as Q3's growth rate.But none of this should be a surprise. TWTR has been beset with frequent turnover in the executive ranks. It also does not help that the CEO, Jack Dorsey, spends time as the head ofSquare Inc(NYSE:SQ).Hey, do Zuckerberg orSnap'sEvan Spiegel side gigs? No, because they realize that the online world is brutally competitive.Bottom Line on Twitter StockActually, the Snap IPO may put even more pressure on Twitter stock. Investors will soon have another high-growth play to put their money into. As a result, TWTR stock will become more marginalized.Now. Dorsey has talked about improving the service and making it easier to use. But so far, the actions have fallen flat. Granted, at the start of the New Year, he asked users for feedback. Yet much of it was kind of vague. Instead, users would rather spend their time on platforms like FB, Instagram, WhatsApp and Snapchat. It's that simple. For the most part, TWTR has failed to keep up with the latest trends, such as with chat and video.Unfortunately, when a consumer tech company gets into this situation, it is tough to turn things around. Just look at classic examples likeYahoo! Inc.(NASDAQ:YHOO) andAOL. They spent years trying to find ways to juice up user numbers - but nothing seemed to work.Part of this is that the brand quickly loses its luster. But there is something else: resources start to dwindle as cash flows drop.In fact, both seem to be issues with Twitter stock. If anything, the brand appears kind of crusty and is also associated with harassment and bullying. Oh, and in terms of the core operations, the company has been reducing the workforce and unloading various segments, such as the recent sale ofFabrictoAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG).Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA) Stock Is Better Than Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN)The likely end-game for TWTR stock, of course, is a sale of the company. But of course, the problem there is that when the company put itself up on the block last year, there was little interest.This does not means things are absolutely hopeless. There are certainly investment opportunities with TWTR stock - but they are probably mostly short-term trades.Tom Taulli runs the InvestorPlace blogIPO Playbook.

Is Advertising Amazon's Next Big Growth Product?;2/7/2017;"In digital advertising there areFacebook(NASDAQ: FB) and Google, and then there's everyone else. But one   company is starting to emerge as a potential contender to the two   ad behemoths:Amazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) is starting to spread its wings as an   advertiser.Amazon certainly has the user data to compete with Facebook or   the bigAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) subsidiary. Although it has only   300 million active customers as of its last update, the shopping   data it has on those users is invaluable. In fact, Amazon may be   able to target advertisements better than Facebook or Google   despite their huge troves of user data. After all, nothing speaks   louder than how people spend their money.Image source: Amazon.com.makeArticleAd();What's this other revenue line item, and why's it growing so   quickly?During Amazon's fourth-quarter earnings call, UBS analyst Eric   Sheridan asked about the ""other"" line item on Amazon's income   statement. He pointed out that it's exhibited a lot of momentum   over the past few years and wondered if that was due to growth in   advertising.The other category includes ""certain advertising services and   our co-branded credit card agreements,"" according to Amazon's   quarterly report. While Amazon did just revamp its credit card   offering, it's been around in some form in the U.S. since 2002   and in Canada since 2012. The vast majority of growth in the   category is probably coming from advertising.And it's been growing. Last year, other revenue in North   America increased 60%. That accelerated to 81% growth in the   fourth quarter. That makes it Amazon's fastest growing source of   revenue, growing even faster than its cloud-computing service,   Amazon Web Services.Granted, the other revenue Amazon brings in accounted for just   1.7% of its total North American sales -- $1.3 billion. So it's   still working on a very small revenue base.Expanding its ad productsMost of the ads Amazon sells are on its own websites. Search   results on Amazon have an increasing number of sponsored   products, with which third-party merchants pay to show up at the   top of the page, not unlike Google's search advertising.   Management described sponsored products as ""off to a great   start,"" indicating they see a lot of room for expansion.A report from BloomReach last fall found that 55% of online   shoppers begin their product search on Amazon.com. As more and   more people search Amazon for products, the more ads it can show.   In fact, sponsored products could start stealing ad budgets away   from Google, which is whyEric Schmidt said it's Google's biggest   competitorin 2014.But Amazon's advertising is starting to extend beyond its own   websites, wading deep into Google's territory. Last year it   developed a header-bidding solution. Header bidding allows   publishers to take more offers for their ad inventory instead of   wading through each offer one by one and taking the first decent   one they find. (This is all done extremely quickly by computer   algorithms.)Amazon's advantage in the space is that it can perform the   complex algorithmic ad bidding process in its AWS servers,   enabling publishers' websites to load faster than other   header-bidding systems allow. Google has historically dominated   the space that header bidding threatens.As mentioned, Amazon is one of the few companies with user   data that can compete with the targeting capabilities of Facebook   or Google. So if it continues to build out its advertising   products on third-party websites, it could start to take a   significant share of revenue from Google and Facebook. Google   generated $15.6 billion in revenue from its network members'   websites last year. Facebook's Audience Network reached a $1   billion run rate in the fourth quarter last year, but the company   hasn't provided any updates since then.The digital ad market is huge. Advertisers spent $195 billion   worldwide on online ads last year, according to eMarketer. That   number is expected to grow to $335 billion by 2020. If Amazon can   grab just a slice of the market producing high-margin revenue, it   could provide a significant boost to its bottom line.Find out why Amazonis one of the 10 best stocks to buy nowMotley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more   than a decade beating the market.

3 Mutual Funds to Buy on Apple's Robust Earnings;2/7/2017;"The tech sector has performed favorably in recent times on the back of encouraging earnings results.Although Trump's proposed trade and immigration policies are expected to weigh on big technology companies, hiscorporate tax repatriation planscould benefit technology companies that hold a lot of cash overseas. These tech companies could repatriate that cash and use it for investments, dividends and buybacks.Tech behemoth Apple IncAAPLmade a strong rebound on the back of strong fiscal first-quarter earnings results. The good show was driven by impressive iPhone 7 and 7 Plus sales. Following these promising trends, investing in technology mutual funds with a significant holding in the iPhone maker and other tech giants will be a prudent decision.Q1 Earnings in FocusApple's fiscal first-quarter earnings of $3.36 per share and revenues of $78.4 billion easily topped the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.22 and $76.9 billion. On a year-over-year basis, earnings and revenues registered growth of 2.4% and 3.3% respectively. Services, which include revenues from Internet Services, App store, Apple Music, AppleCare, Apple Pay, licensing and other services, surged 18% year over year to nearly $7.2 billion.Additionally, total iPhone unit sales came in at about $78.3 million, up 5% year over year. Revenues from iPhone also grew 5% from the year-ago quarter to $54.4 billion (69.4% of total revenue). Moreover, optimism of the tech behemoth's forthcoming series of iPhone upgrades in the coming months encouraged some analysts to raise their price targets.Apple Rally Boosts Tech SectorGains in Apple came as a breather for the broader technology sector. The iPhone maker remained the biggest company in the index in terms of market capitalization. Along with Apple some other big tech companies like MicrosoftMSFT, AlphabetGOOGL, NetflixNFLXand FacebookFBreported solid earnings results.Microsoft's earnings per share (EPS) and revenues for fiscal Q2 beat our estimates, while Alphabet reported higher-than-expected revenues for the Q4.

Can Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Pass This Turing Test?;2/7/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFinancially and technically,Facebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) seems to have everything going its way. Facebook's latest video announcements have it playinghardballagainstAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) andNetflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX) in the race to dominate the next generation of video. The company is rapidlyapproaching 2 billion usersin a world with 7 billion people.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockFacebook stock's fourth-quarter results were nothing short of awe-inspiring,as InvestorPlace writer Tom Taulli reported, net income rose 128% year-over-year, compared with 2015, as revenue rose 53%.The revenue run rate is still one-third that ofAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), but the companies are competing ever-more fiercely for the same internet advertisers and, increasingly, FB is winning.So why is Facebook stock sitting below its 2017 high? Why did it rise only 2% on those incredible earnings? Why does FB stock seem stuck in first gear?Call it the perils of leadership.Facebook Stock and Political OppositionFacebook has become a mirror on the human condition, and civilization's ills have come calling on it.7 Tech Stocks With Explosive Growth PotentialGangs are now waging theirturf warson the service. Its human decision-making is opaque, and people are being destroyed by thatwithout recourse.Worse, despite FB's insistence that it's not a media company, and that it is not political in any way, people are treating it as both.Many conservatives tied to the Trump Administrationnow count Facebook as an enemyandsuspect all those who work alongside it.This is happening even while FB goes to unprecedented lengths to fight terrorist propaganda,working alongside law enforcement and security agencies.The truth or falsehood of the political charges should be irrelevant to an investor. What matters is that Facebook is seen to be a media company, and seen to be a political actor, that it's being treated as such, and that responding to all this is expected to cost money, reducing margins and net income.Fortunately, FB stock has a way to fight back.FB Stock: A Turing TestFacebook stock is in a race against billions of people who want its network to pass a Turing Test. Its network must pretend to be human, and to act humanely, without using people to do it.Here are just some examples of what I'm talking about.FB must act againstfake news, phishing profilescreated by criminals, charges of political favoritism, plus millions of individual complaints about the actions of third parties,largeandsmall, in an automated fashion.This is because software scales in ways people cannot. If Facebook mustgo to court constantlyin order to protect itself, it can't continue to grow. It must automate its own self-policing, as with a recent patent application aimed atfighting a photo-tag spambot.3 Reasons Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Is Much More Than Its Main PlatformAt the same time, FB stock must fight charges that its software is becoming bloated, denseand difficult to use.It must accept the increased complexity of video rights managementin this regard.It also must accept the fact thatmistakes will be made by softwareacting in human ways, just as people make mistakes.Fortunately, all I'm describing is a need for more artificial intelligence, and that happens to be the area in software where Facebook is putting a lot of its money right now.The company's recent delivery of a system for identifying the content of photos, andallowing them to be searched as text is searched, is just the tip of the iceberg for what's ahead for Facebook stock.By fighting for its own survival with artificial intelligence, FB stock is pointing the way to a futuredefined by artificial intelligence. This is less about creating an ""artificial assistant,"" like Amazon's Alexa or Google Home, both advertised during last week's Super Bowl, and more about creating intelligence within the network so questions are answered before they are asked.If Facebook stock can succeed here, it can overcome both its own problems and a lot of yours, to mutual profit.Dana Blankenhornis a financial and technology journalist.

Zillow In Position To Dominate Online Real Estate Ad Market;2/6/2017;"Zillow Group(Z), operator of the online house-hunting network that dwarfs all competitors, has the inside track for winning a dominant share of real estate agents' digital ad spending.""Their competitive position is quite strong,"" said Macquarie Capital analyst Tom White.makeArticleAd();While the homes-for-sale data that underpins sites like Zillow and Realtor aren't proprietary, White notes that Zillow ""is out-innovating its competitors in augmenting that basic listings data"" with other data, including listings of homes not for sale, and by investing heavily in mobile.Citing comScore data, Zillow says its five brands account for nearly two-thirds of the total online real estate category and nearly three-quarters of the mobile segment.Yet White notes that there's ""a big disconnect"" between Zillow's majority share of traffic and its slice of the real estate advertising pie.Turning clicks into commission for agents and more ad dollars for Zillow turns out to be easier said than done.Fast CompanyA partial explanation is that a big slice of real estate advertising dollars is going to companies that aren't direct competitors, likeFacebook(FB) andAlphabet's(GOOGL) Google.But the good news for Zillow is that it has been getting better and better monetizing that traffic, growing sales by upwards of 30% over the past year even as real estate agents have lowered their overall spending on digital advertising.The bulk of Zillow's revenue - 70% in the last quarter - comes from its Premier Agent program, where sales rose 32.5% from a year ago. Real estate agents pay to have their picture, credentials and ratings linked to Zillow's listings of homes for sale, with up to four agents attached to each listing.Home shoppers who don't have an agent are likely to click on those with high ratings and a history of similar transactions, and that's exactly what Zillow wants to see.Zillow has a strategy to help accelerate the real estate industry's evolution to the survival of the fittest. Zillow is looking to help the best real estate agents - the ones who can best capitalize on the leads that Zillow generates and will therefore pay the highest ad prices - to extend their domination.[ibdchart symbol=""Z"" type=""daily"" size=""threequarter"" position=""rightchart"" ]""We are accelerating the broader trend across the real estate agent population of higher-producing agents gaining market share from those who are less productive,"" Chief Executive Spencer Rascoff said on a November conference call with analysts.Agent OverhaulRascoff also noted that Zillow overhauled the ways it sells ads to its Premier Agents last quarter. Under its old model, Zillow came up with a price for a fixed number of ad impressions based on a ZIP code's characteristics.But Rascoff noted that the fixed-price model sometimes sold out impressions in desirable ZIP codes, requiring the company to call up agents to increase ad prices. So now prices will be set dynamically, based on the total dollars agents budget to advertise on Zillow in a given ZIP code.The goal is ""to have the marketplace"" determine ad costs, Rascoff told analysts.Zillow, which reports fourth-quarter earnings on Tuesday, advised analysts on its November call that its guidance carried an extra margin of error because of the nationwide rollout of the new pricing strategy.Analysts expect the company to earn 11 cents a share vs. a one-cent loss a year ago, as revenue rises 31% to $222 million. In 2017 revenue is expected to grow 23% to $1.038 billion.Smaller Number, But Bigger SpendingThe number of agents advertising on Zillow declined modestly in the third quarter to 89,147, but that was part of a planned shakeout. At the same time, the number of advertisers spending at least $5,000 per month rose 79% from a year ago, while average spending per agent rose 46%.IBD'S TAKE:Zillow shares showed promise in early December, after forming acup-with-handleand starting to break out. But shares retreated into a flat base and remain there. Check out IBD Stock Checkup to see the top companies in theInternet-Content group.Tuesday's results also will provide a checkup on two other new initiatives: a partnership with Facebook and Zillow's first effort to monetize the sell-side of the housing market.Zillow is partnering with Facebook to offer a precision-ad targeting program that enables real estate agents to connect on Facebook with home shoppers who are using its site or Trulia, its sister property acquired in early 2015.Zillow also announced its Seller Boost program in October, involving the placement of Premier Agent ads on listings of its huge inventory of homes not for sale to provide potential leads for agents if the homeowner decides to sell.Leveraging The NetworkAt the same time, Zillow is trying to leverage its large network of users - 164.5 million in the seasonally slower third quarter - to get a broader slice of advertising dollars.Zillow's marketplace for mortgages, which connects homebuyers to area mortgage lenders much likeLendingTree(TREE), generated $19.8 million in revenue in the third quarter, up 57% from a year ago.The traffic at Zillow properties is roughly triple that of its closest direct competitor, Realtor.com, which was acquired byNews Corp.(NWSA) in November 2014.Thanks to the merger with Trulia, Zillow removed a major competitor. Meanwhile fears that News Corp. might jump-start the growth and promotion of Realtor.com have been mostly unfounded, Macquarie analyst White said.Bigger Slice Of PieBy some measures, though, Zillow has a growing slice of a pie that has been shrinking in recent years. Borrell Associates estimates that real estate agents spent $7.7 billion on digital ads in 2016, down from $9 billion in 2014. Some 78% of real estate ad spending was done online in 2016, Kip Cassino, Borrell's executive vice president of research, told IBD.The decline in spending partly reflects a relatively modest pace of home sales, especially among millennials, Cassino says.

3 Stocks We're Never Selling;2/6/2017;"We Fools are constantly on the hunt for winning stock ideas   that we believe will generate strong returns for years on end.   When we think we have identified a winning business, we like to   buy it and hang on to it through thick and thin.With that in mind, we asked a team of Fools to highlight a   stock in their portfolio that they plan to hang on to for the   ultra-long term. Read on to see why they pickedAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) ,Under Armour(NYSE: UA) (NYSE: UAA) , andStarbucks(NASDAQ: SBUX) .Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();Alphabet will continue to benefit from digital browsingJamal Carnette, CFA(Alphabet): The market wasn't kind to Alphabet's recently   reported fourth-quarter and full-year results. Overall, the   company continues to post enviable growth rates for a company of   its scale. Alphabet increased revenue 20.4% over the previous   year's results; on a quarterly basis, it grew revenue 22.2% over   last year's corresponding period. However, the company's   fourth-quarter bottom line increased by only 8.3%, to $5.3   billion, as Alphabet's provision for income taxes increased by a   massive 450% over last year's corresponding quarter, on account   of a one-time tax adjustment. Still, the fickle market sold off   shares to the tune of 2% because the company missed analyst   expectations.On a positive note, Alphabet confirmed that mobile search is   one of its highest-growth areas. The biggest shift in internet   browsing over the past five years has been from desktop to   mobile, and that move benefits Alphabet, considering Google   controls approximately 95% of the mobile-search market.The company also continues to grow its advertising business.   Earlier this year, a shocking report fromMorgan Stanleyanalyst Brian Nowak found that 85% of every new dollar in online   advertising was going to just two companies: Alphabet andFacebook. As the shift to online advertising continues, look for Alphabet   to continue to post strong revenue growth rates.Simply put, Alphabet's long-term thesis remains intact. The   company is the largest digital advertiser and search engine in   the world, and Alphabet will only continue to grow search and   advertising revenue as internet usage increases from a   combination of penetration and accessibility, while a push for   digital advertising will boost the company's bottom line.Still a believer in Under ArmourBrian Feroldi(Under Armour): The past six months haven't been kind to Under Armour's   shareholders. The stock took a big hit inlate October, after management ratcheted back its long-term growth   targets. More recently, shares gotcrushedafter the company reported sales growth of just 12% in the   all-important fourth quarter. Not only was that figure far shy of   management's guidance, but the company's CFO also resigned   suddenly. That's a lot of bad news for investors to take in all   at one time, so it was no surprise to see that shares took a big   hit.However, a closer look at the quarter hints that investors   shouldn't throw in the towel on this growth story just yet. While   total sales growth was disappointing, the biggest culprit was   slowing sales in North America. That's understandable, as the   retail environment stateside was quite challenging for many   retailers over the holidays. The recent bankruptcies of The   Sports Authority, Eastern Mountain Sports, Sports Chalet,   Golfsmith, City Sports, and Bob's Stores didn't help the matter,   either.However, Under Armour's report did contain a handful of bright   spots. Direct-to-consumer sales -- which bypass retailers   altogether -- jumped by 23% and now account for nearly 40% of   total sales. And footwear sales grew by a solid 36% year over   year. Best of all, international revenue grew by 55% and now   comprises 16% of total sales. These figures suggest that Under   Armour's brand still remains strong.While the company has some near-term challenges to overcome, I   have a hard time believing that this growth story is dead. As   long as founder and CEO Kevin Plank is at the helm, this is one   stock I can't ever see myself parting ways with.Middle-class people love their coffee, and there's about to   be a lot more of themJasonHall(Starbucks): The global coffee giant's stock is down around 8% since   first-quarter earnings came out in late January, and not without   some justification. After all, Starbucks reported that traffic in   its North American stores was pretty much flat in the quarter, a   trend that started in 2016 and could continue through 2017.   Furthermore, management indicated that it may feel the same way   and is now projecting revenue growth between 8% and 10%, a   reduction from original full-year guidance of 10% or greater at   the end of the prior quarter.But Starbucks isn't the kind of company that will scare me   away with a minor flattening of growth in its most mature market   -- especially not right now. Starbucks' best days could be   ahead of it, even as Howard Schultz steps down as CEO for the   second time.To start with, Starbucks' growth opportunity in Asia is simply   enormous. Within a decade, the middle class in China alone is   likely to be double the size of the U.S., and Starbucks'   management recently said it expects China to become the company's   biggest market. Here's a little more context: At the start of   2017, Starbucks had nearly 16,000 stores in the Americas, versus   fewer than 6,800 in the China/Asia Pacific region, with 2,500 of   those in China.Bottom line: Growth very well could slow further -- or even   stall -- in the company's more mature markets, but I won't sell.   The global growth story is only getting started, and that's going   to drive decades of growth. I'm not missing out on that.10 stocks we like better than Alphabet (C   shares)When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Xiaomi Was Going to Rival Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock — What Happened?;2/6/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOnly a few years ago,Xiaomiwas worryingApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) investors. Xiaomi had become the world's third-largest smartphone manufacturer and was expanding into other products like fitness trackers, TVs and video streamers. It was valued at $45 billion, hired a prominent executive away fromAlphabet Inc's(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google and planned an expansion into America.makeArticleAd();Source: XiaomiToday? It has dropped out of the top five smartphone vendors list, marketshare in China has plummeted, the Google exec has jumped ship and some analysts are valuing the company as low as $3.6 billion.What happened to Xiaomi and is its threat to Apple truly neutralized? Or are the troubled Chinese tech giant's plans merely on hold?Xiaomi's Rapid RisePrivately held Xiaomi was founded in 2010, released its first smartphone in 2011 and rapidly gained popularity in China. The company offered high-quality in its smartphones, with low pricing -a combination that led to it being the top-selling smartphone brand in China by 2014.It came seemingly out of nowhere to capture thethird place spot for worldwide smartphone salesthat year as well. The feat was especially impressive given that Xiaomi was not selling its phones in the U.S. market.9 Best Cheap Stocks to Buy Now Under $9.99Like Apple, Google andSamsung Electronics Co Ltd(OTCMKTS:SSNLF), the company wanted to expand into consumer electronics in general. That effort included the inexpensive Mi Band fitness tracker that vaulted Xiaomi intosecond place worldwide for wearable salesby 2015, behind onlyFitbit Inc(NYSE:FIT).The company pursued a strategy of investing in hardware startups, buying into dozens of companies making everything from smart lighting to headphones and TVs. While these products are not always Xiaomi-branded, they are designed to all work well together.It also added software and services to the mix.Chinese CompetitionThe success of Xiaomi spurred homegrown competition. Other Chinese manufacturers stepped up to the plate and followed Xiaomi's formula. However, they did a better job of marketing to increasingly demanding Chinese consumers by charging a little more but offering more striking designs. One of these companies -Huawei- was good enough that Googlepartnered with it to build the Nexus 6P smartphone in 2015. Xiaomi's phones seem lower quality than these competitors and rather than innovative, its designs are often seen as being too similar to Apple's.At this point, Xiaomi has been leapfrogged by its Chinese smartphone rivals. While Xiaomi has dropped off the global top five smartphone manufacturer list, China's Huawei,OppoandVivocurrently hold the third, fourth and fifth places.American ObstaclesKey to Xiaomi's ambitions were an expansion into the U.S. market. To lead that effort, thecompany hired Hugo Barra- the VP who oversaw Android product management - from Google.However, Xiaomi's U.S. push has failed to materialize. There are dozens of products Xiaomi offers online through itsMi Store(which carries only a fraction of Xiaomi's and its partner companies' gear), including eight different smartphone models, multiple smart TVs, VR headsets and even a self-balancing electric scooter. U.S. customers are limited to being able to buy a few sets of earbuds, a pair of headphones, a battery pack and a Bluetooth speaker.A big part of the problem in moving into the U.S. market is that Xiaomi has taken advantage of China's relatively lax approach to patents. In late 2014, it wasbanned from selling smartphones in Indiaas a result of a patent infringement ruling (it has since resumed Indian operations). If Xiaomi tried to push into the U.S. with its smartphones at this point, there's a good chance Apple and other tech companies would sue it into oblivion.In an attempt to defend against this scenario, Xiaomi has begun buying up patents. Last year,it purchased 1,500 patentsfromMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) relating to areas like wireless communication, multimedia and video, and the cloud.No Longer a Threat to Apple?At this point, Xiaomi is a paper tiger that isvalued at as little as $3.6 billion. In 2015, it sold 70 million-plus smartphones, missing its initial goal of 100 million and then the revised goal of 80 million. It's refusing to say how many it sold in 2016, but that silence speaks volumes.Hugo Barra bailed on the companya few weeks ago, joiningFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB). A few months before leaving, he toldReutersthat lower smartphone sales wouldn't impact the companybecause it made no money on them:""Basically we're giving [handsets] to you without making any money… we care about the recurring revenue streams over many years. We could sell 10 billion smartphones and we wouldn't make a single dime in profits.""The problem with that approach is that as of 2015,smartphones still accounted for 95% of the company's revenue. All those other products and services just don't seem to be sticking.Barra also told reporters not to expect Xiaomi to release a smartphone in the U.S. in 2017.3 Reasons Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Is Much More Than Its Main PlatformXiaomi CEO Lei Junposted a letter to employeeson Facebook in January. In it, he admitted the company had pushed ahead too fast, cutting into its long-term growth, but says the worst is over.The company's revenue target is RMB 100 billion (roughly $14.5 billion) -the same as its 2015 target. In trying to be so much, so fast, Xiaomi has set itself up for some very challenging times. If treading water is the goal it has set for itself, Apple doesn't have much to worry about.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace7 Tech Stocks With Explosive Growth PotentialThe Top 10 Dow Dividend Stocks for FebruaryThe postXiaomi Was Going to Rival Apple Inc.

Tech Companies Take a Stand Against Trump's Immigration Ban;2/6/2017;"Immigration has been a driving force behind many of the   leading technology companies in the United States.Some, includingMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) , are led by CEOs who were not born in this   country while over 200 companies on the Fortune 500 were started   by immigrants or their children. In addition most top tech brands   are global, with offices all over the world, and talent working   domestically that was not born in the U.S.At least partly because of that nearly 100 technology   companies including Microsoft,Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) ,Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) ,Facebook,Twitter, and many others have filed a legal brief in the U.S. Court of   Appeals for the 9th Circuit opposing President Donald Trump's   temporary immigration ban keeping people from seven predominantly   Muslim countries from entering the U.S. In the brief the   companies argue that the ban ""inflicts significant harm on   American business.""makeArticleAd();Trump signed an executive order banning immigration from     seven predominantly Muslim countries. Image source: Getty     Images.What are they opposing?In one of his first acts as president, Trump signed an   executive order banning refugees and visa-holders from seven   predominantly Muslim countries from entering the United States.   That order has been stayed by aU.S. District judgeand an appeals courtdeclined to immediately reinstatethe presidential order. The technology companies, many of which   operate and employ workers in and from the impacted countries   filed their brief to show their opposition to the president's   actions.""Immigrants make many of the Nation's greatest discoveries,   and create some of the country's most innovative and iconic   companies,"" the brief states. ""America has long recognized the   importance of protecting ourselves against those who would do us   harm. But it has done so while maintaining our fundamental   commitment to welcoming immigrants -- through increased   background checks and other controls on people seeking to enter   our country.""The companies that signed the brief acknowledged what Trump   was, at least on the surface, trying to accomplish with the   executive order.""We share your goal of ensuring that our immigration system   meets today's security needs and keeps our country safe,"" said a   draft of that letter obtained byBloomberg News. ""We are concerned, however, that your recent Executive Order   will affect many visa holders who work hard here in the United   States and contribute to our country's success.""Tech requires global talentPutting aside any political questions, the tech industry   opposes Trump's immigration ban in part because it takes global   talent to compete. The U.S. simply does not produce enough   workers -- specifically coders who write the software that powers   the products made by these companies -- to meet demand.To fill those needs companies across the U.S. use H1B visas to   receive special dispensation to hire workers who otherwise would   not be able to legally work in the country. A H1B visa, according   toMyVisaJobs.com, allows U.S. employers to temporarily employ foreign   professionals in specialty occupations for three years,   extendable to six years. ""To qualify for H1B Visa, the foreign   professional must hold a bachelor's or higher degree from an   accredited college or university in the specialty occupation,""   according to the site. In some cases specialized training can be   substituted for a degree.Technology companies dominate the list of employers using   workers on H1B visas. Data compiled by MyVisaJobs.com shows that   in 2016 Infosys held the top spot, having sponsored 25,405 visas.   while Microsoft, Apple, and Alphabet were all in the top 25.It's about more than self interestIt's easy to see the business reasons behind why these   technology companies oppose Trump's immigration restrictions.   Most, if not all of the companies that filed the brief would be   impacted by having employees unable to travel and in some cases   the executive order would impact hiring.For at least some of these companies, however, the opposition   goes beyond pure business logic. Many of these brands were either   founded by immigrants or by the children of immigrants and   immediate business concerns aside, they simply want a world where   new immigrants to the U.S. can be free to move here and found the   next Microsoft, Apple, or Alphabet.10 stocks we like better than MicrosoftWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Alphabet (GOOGL) to Sell Terra Bella Business to Planet Labs;2/6/2017;"Alphabet Inc.'sGOOGLGoogle announced on Friday that will sell its Terra Bella Imaging satellite business to Planet Labs.In exchange, Google receives a stake in planet and will also enter in to a multi-year contract to buy its Earth-imaging data.Google did not disclose the financial terms of the deal. Bloomberg had reported in January that talks were in progress between the two companies.For the last six months, Alphabet has outperformed the ZacksInternet-Servicesindustry. It has returned 1.87% compared with the industry's return of 1.17%.Formerly known as Skybox, the Earth imaging company was founded in 2009 and the search giant bought it for $500 million in 2014, the same year when Skybox was named no. 1 on Inc. magazine's 25 Most Audacious Companies. Google rebranded it to Terra Bella last year.In Quest of Financial DisciplineThe move underscores Alphabet's efforts to trim relatively less-revenue generating businesses and attain financial discipline. The company could save more by purchasing satellite imagery from a third party instead of operating its own imaging satellite business.Alphabet's sales, marketing and R&D expenses have gone up considerably in the last five years. There are also some other margin pressures. The most significant at the moment is related to currency, which continued to impact Alphabet's results despite the fact that it has a hedging program in place.Alphabet Inc. Total Expenses (TTM)Alphabet Inc. Total Expenses (TTM)|Alphabet Inc. QuoteOther expense pressures include fast-paced international growth, a growing volume of lower-priced YouTube clicks and strength of the mobile platform. So we believe that Alphabet has foreseen an escalation of costs in the years to come and is gearing up well in advance with decisions like these.The company has recently been getting rid of its audacious ventures. In Aug 2015, it reportedly curbed the expansion of its high-speed fiber optic Internet network, cutting 9% of its staff. In November, the company scaled back Project Wing, its experimental drone delivery program.Benefits for Planet LabsPrivately-held Planet Labs operates with dozens of small satellites that take pictures of the Earth surface frequently. However, the resolution of the images is low. Terra Bella has larger satellites with high image resolution but its fleet contains only seven satellites, which limits the frequency of capturing images.Thus, we believe that through this acquisition, Planet Labs will add high resolution satellites to its fleet. Both companies share the satellite imaging space with giants like Airbus Group'sEADSYAirbus Defence & Space and DigitalGlobeDGI.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, Alphabet is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. A better-ranked stock in the broader technology sector is Intersil CorporationISIL, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Will Facebook Challenge Netflix and Amazon Via Set Top Boxes?;2/5/2017;"Facebook(NASDAQ: FB) is reportedly developing a dedicated video app for   set top boxes to  expand its social networking ecosystem   into living rooms, according to theWall Street Journal. The app will be different from its existing app for set top   boxes, which is basically just a widescreen version of its mobile   app.Image source: Facebook.makeArticleAd();Instead, the new app will mainly deliver videos from Facebook,   potentially turning it into a streaming rival toNetflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) andAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) . This supports previous reports that Facebook was   looking to license original content, and suggests that its users   could deliver live broadcasts to TVs via Facebook Live.Will this move pay off? Or are Netflix, Amazon, andAlphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) YouTube already too far ahead in   the video streaming wars?Understanding Facebook's video effortsYouTube is the biggest video streaming site in the world, but   Facebook's video ecosystem has been growing quickly. Last   January, Facebook revealed that  its users watched 100   million hours of videos per day. At the time,Business Insiderestimated that YouTube users were watching about 650 million   hours of video every day.During last quarter's conference call, Facebook CEO  Mark   Zuckerberg called video ""a megatrend on the same order as   mobile"", and highlighted the ways that video ecosystem was   expanding. It recently added a new tab in the Facebook app for   top videos and recommendations in the U.S., tested a version of   Live 360 videos for slower connections, and added live face masks   and camera effects. It also plans to invest more in original   video content to ""seed that ecosystem"" throughout 2017.Facebook's interest in videos makes sense, since video ads   cost much more than traditional display ads. As Facebook's active   user growth slows down, video ads can bolster its top line by   milking more ad revenue from existing users. Since nearly 94% of   Facebook's 1.86 billion monthly active users already access the    site from mobile devices, it also needs to look toward   other platforms -- like set top boxes -- to continue growing its   ad ecosystem.Carving out a niche between Netflix and AmazonAt first glance, it seems like Facebook could collide with   Netflix and Amazon's streaming video ecosystems. But Facebook   doesn't plan to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on big   budget shows likeHouse of CardsandMan in the High Castle.Instead, Zuckerberg plans to focus on ""shorter-form content to   start,"" noting that the videos will generally be split into   content people produce socially for friends, promotional content   from businesses and celebrities, and a class of Facebook-financed   ""premium"" content to differentiate it from other platforms. CFO   David Wehner was vague about what that premium content would   actually be, merely stating that the company was ""looking at a   wide range of content"" and ""working toward a revenue share model   with creators.""Those statements indicate that Facebook wants to carve out a   niche on set top boxes, instead of trading costly blows with   Netflix and Amazon. Since Facebook's video platform is all about   delivering ads, the platform should also be free -- so it won't   be competing for Netflix or Amazon's subscription-based   revenues.Is Facebook actually making a play for smart     homes?Facebook's new set top box app could also help it gain a   foothold in smart home ecosystems. Amazon has already established   a major presence in homes with its Kindle tablets, Fire TV set   top boxes, and Echo speakers. Google is trying to catch up with   Home, andAppletethers devices to its HomeKit platform for iOS.Facebook doesn't have an official horse in that race yet, but   Zuckerberg recently showcased Jarvis, a smart  home AI   platform he developed for his own home. The platform, which uses   voice commands to control devices, is controlled via a Messenger   bot.Image source: Facebook.By expanding Facebook's ecosystem to set top boxes like Apple   TV, Fire TV, and Roku, the social network couldpotentiallypiggyback off that hardware to sync with smart home devices. If   Facebook links Messenger to those ""hubs"", it could take control   of users' homes, gather even more data from those users, and   widen its moat against Amazon, Google, Apple, and other   challengers.The key takeawayFacebook's plans to expand its video ecosystem aren't   surprising, and a dedicated video app for set top boxes would be   the logical next step. It won't challenge heavyweights like   Netflix and Amazon, but it could capture a niche market of users   who want to view Facebook video content on a streaming platform   optimized for TVs. If the effort is successful, it could make its   video ads more valuable and give it a firm foundation for   eventually challenging other smart home players.Find out why Facebookis one of the 10 best stocks to buy nowMotley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent     more than a decade beating the market.

No, Google's Brand Is Not More Valuable Than Apple's;2/5/2017;"Last week, Brand Finance came out with itsannual listing of brand valuations. In a somewhat shocking finding, the consulting group declared   thatApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) had lost its supremacy toAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) subsidiary Google.Alphabet is a phenomenal company with a long track record of   innovation, and the Google brand is extremely powerful.   Nevertheless, it still isn't in the same league as Apple's brand   in terms of total value.Is Apple turning sour?While Brand Finance still rates Apple as the second most   valuable brand in the world, it appears to have a fairly negative   view of the iPhone maker. According to the recent report:makeArticleAd();However, Apple's evangelists are beginning to lose their     faith. The snaking queues of early adopters have shrunk almost     to the point of invisibility. Apple has failed to maintain its     technological advantage and has repeatedly disillusioned its     advocates with tweaks when material changes were expected.Put simply, Apple has over-exploited the goodwill of its     customers, it has failed to generate significant revenues from     newer products such as the Apple Watch and cannot demonstrate     that genuinely innovative technologies desired by consumers are     in the pipeline. Its brand has lost its luster and must now     compete on an increasingly level playing field not just with     traditional rivalSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) , but a slew of Chinese brands such as     Huawei and OnePlus in the smartphone market, Apple's key source     of profitability.As a result of this assessment, Brand Finance reduced its   estimate of the Apple brand's value by 27% year over year, to   $107.1 billion. Meanwhile, it estimated Google's brand value at   $109.5 billion, up 24% from $88.2 billion a year ago. Brand   Finance cited Google's dominance in search, among other things,   to justify the big increase in its brand value.Consumers are paying more and more for iPhonesBrand Finance's declining opinion of the Apple brand is   contradicted by consumers' willingness to pay more and more for   iPhones. Last quarter, Apple reported record quarterly iPhone   sales of 78.3 million units. Even more impressively, the average   selling price (ASP) reached a new record of $695.The iPhone's ASP hit a new record last quarter. Image     source: Apple.In the same quarter two years ago, right after Apple released   the hugely popular iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, the iPhone's ASP   had surged 8% year over year, to $687. Apple's ability to   continue growing that ASP over the past two years, despite facing   stiff foreign exchange headwinds in both years, is a testament to   the massive value of its brand.Indeed, the cost of high-quality smartphones is coming down.   Leaving aside Samsung, several Chinese manufacturers have become   known for designing high-quality smartphones and selling them at   near-breakeven prices in recent years. Apple's ability to command   a huge price premium over competitors -- which extends beyond   smartphones to PCs and (to a lesser extent) tablets -- indicates   that its brand is as strong as ever.Apple is a profit machineAccording to Brand Finance, Apple has failed to maintain a   technological lead over Samsung and other rivals. In fact, many   tech pundits have argued in recent years that Samsung has   overtaken Apple in terms of innovation.Assuming that the two companies are on a relatively even   technological footing, they should be able to produce roughly   similar earnings. However, that's not even close to being   true.Last quarter, Apple barely retook the lead in terms of   smartphone shipments with 78.3 million, compared to 77.5 million   shipments for Samsung,according to Strategy Analytics. Yet Samsung's mobile-division operating profit totaled just   $2.1 billion for the quarter. By contrast, Apple's operating   profit was more than 10 times higher at $23.4 billion.On a full-year basis -- or looking just at the smartphone   business -- Apple's advantage is somewhat smaller. But any way   you slice it, Apple generates many times more profit than   Samsung. (In its most recent fiscal year, Apple's operating   profit was $60 billion, compared to about $10 billion for   Samsung's mobile division.)If Apple doesn't have superior technology relative to Samsung,   its brand must be doing most of the heavy lifting to generate $50   billion of additional operating profit on an annual basis. That's   more than double Alphabet'stotalannual operating profit of $23.7 billion.Google may be a powerful brand. However, it doesn't come close   to the value of the Apple brand, which has turned the   traditionally low-margin technology hardware business into a   long-term cash cow that churns out tens of billions of dollars of   profit every year.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

How Profitable Is SpaceX, Really?;2/5/2017;"Last year, prior to the big SpaceXplosion -- which kind of     knockedSpaceX off the rails-- we spent a lot of time digging into SpaceX's finances.     We asked:How does SpaceX make money? And we answered the question: ""How profitable is SpaceX"" when it makes all that money?Much of this was based on educated guesswork, however, as we     extrapolated what we knew about the finances at SpaceX rivalsBoeing(NYSE: BA) ,Lockheed Martin(NYSE: LMT) ,Orbital ATK(NYSE: OA) , andAirbus(NASDAQOTH: EADSY) , and applied it to what wethoughtthat might mean for SpaceX's own finances. It would have been a     whole lot easier to just take a good hard look at SpaceX's own     financial documents, and get the answers straight from the     source.Lucky for us -- and for you --The Wall Street Journaljust did that.makeArticleAd();Here's your first look at SpaceX's CRS-8-mission rocket --     before it becomes the first ""reused"" orbital rocket in history.     Now let's take a look at SpaceX's finances. Image source:     SpaceX.In a detailed,multi-page expose, theJournalrevealed last monththat it has come into possession of a treasure trove of internal   financial documents from SpaceX. Combined with interviews of   ex-SpaceX staff, theJournalwas able to put together a pretty good picture of SpaceX's   finances.It isn't a pretty picture. Here's what we know.Wall Street Journalspills the beans on SpaceXSpaceX likes to portray itself as a growing rival to space   incumbents such as Boeing and Lockheed, Airbus and Orbital ATK.   But in fact, SpaceX's revenue growth halted --temporarily, we hope-- in 2014. Two failed space launches in the past two   years curtailed launch activity at the space start-up, with the   result that revenue actually peaked in 2014, at roughly $1   billion.SpaceX's sales then declined to just $945 million in 2015,   when the company conducted only six launches. (Revenue may have   grown again in 2016, or it may not have. The documents theJournalobtained apparently didn't extend into 2016.)What the documentsdoshow, though -- and show quite clearly -- is that no matter how   much revenue SpaceX records, it's not earning much profit from   that revenue.Dissecting SpaceX's financesAs revealed in theJournal's report, SpaceX turned just a small fraction of its $1 billion   in 2014 launch revenue into operating profit -- much lessnetprofit. The numbers aren't entirely clear from theJournal's chart, but appear to show SpaceX earning an operating profit   of perhaps 0.2% on $1 billion in revenue -- profitability far   below the 10%-ish profit margin that Boeing earns on its space   operations, or the 12.6% operating profit margin at Lockheed   Martin.That bleak situation got even worse in 2015 when a small   reduction in launch revenue sufficed to push SpaceX deeply into   the red, and forced the company to record a $260 million loss on   $945 million in revenue.What SpaceX hopes to earnSpaceX'ssuccessful return to spacelast month holds forth the promise that things will improve in   2017. Prior to the September SpaceXplosion, documents show that   SpaceX was targeting $1.8 billion in launch revenue in 2016, and   aiming to earn $55 million in profit thereon. While it probably   didn't get there in 2016, there's still a chance that it could   succeed in 2017 -- and achieve a 3% operating profit margin.And that's your answer right there: Currently, all indications   suggest that SpaceX isnotprofitable, but losing money. Only if things go well, and SpaceX   regains its footing in 2017, can we hope that the company will   achieve positive operating profit margins of 3%.Even if SpaceX succeeds at this, though, it would still be   earning only roughly half the 5.7% operating margin that Airbus   earns at its ""Defence and Space"" business (as reported byS&P Global Market Intelligence). SpaceX's targeted $55 million profit would also be a small   fraction of the $400 million in annual profit that the Boeing and   Lockheed joint venture ULAearns. On the other hand, SpaceX would eclipse thebreak-even profitsat Airbus' dedicated space launch subsidiary, Arianespace -- and   SpaceX could grow its profit margins in the future if its plans   to begin reusing relanded rockets, at lower cost than using   ""expendable"" rockets, pan out.SpaceX 2.0: A New HopeSo what's the upshot for SpaceX for investors who hope to one   day invest in its IPO, and for investors who already,today, own a piece of SpaceX through their investment inAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) stock? Simply put, the documents   theJournalunearthed show that SpaceX is not nearly as profitable an   operation as we once believed it to be..There's also a corollary conclusion, though, that affects   investors in the space industry in general. Lacking substantial   profits from its launch business, SpaceX is going to have a very   hard time financing atrip to Mars-- a voyage it hopes to makeas early as next year-- and a voyage that could inspire a whole host of   other companies to accelerate their own races to space.HowdoesSpaceX plan to fund its first trip to Mars in 2018 and the dozens   of follow-up trips it hopes to make in the years and decades to   follow? Tune back in next week for the answer.(But here's a hint:It will involve satellites.)10 stocks we like better than BoeingWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

These 2 Tech Companies Have Made the Most AI Acquisitions;2/4/2017;"Market-intelligence firm CB Insights has compiled alistof the major acquirers of private artificial-intelligence (AI)   companies over the last five years. This list reveals well-known   tech giants making large investments to increase their   capabilities in AI. It also provides insight into the evolution   of the technology, and its direct uses.Google and Intel are in the race for artificial     intelligence. Image source: Intel.makeArticleAd();Google's been on a buying spreeAlphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google is well known for itsaspirations in artificial intelligence; it heads the list with 11 acquisitions. A number of these   companies specialized in areas that led directly to recent   improvements in the Google Assistant. They also tie to the launch   of Google Home and its plans to take onAmazon's(NASDAQ: AMZN)Alexa virtual assistantand the Echo smart-speaker home system.The acquisition of Emu provided an assistant that used voice   commands to schedule appointments, set reminders, and make   reservations. Api.ai added tools for building conversational   bots, while Dark Blue Labs contributed natural-language   improvements. Two companies helped personalize recommendations:   Clever Sense learned about nearby coffee shops, restaurants and   bars; Jetpac searched for visual cues in photos to improve   recommendations. Timeful used priorities to add items to a   calendar using smart scheduling.Three companies specialized in image recognition: DNNResearch   focused on image search and facial recognition; Moodstocks   technology improved image recognition for smartphones; Vision   Factory worked to enhance accuracy and speed in object   recognition. Each of the aforementioned technologies serves to   improve specific functions in Google Home's ecosystem, and   specifically within Assistant. This will compete directly in the   virtual personal assistant market currently led by Amazon's   Alexa.London-based DeepMind was one of the largest acquisitions,   with a price tag estimated at $660 million. Google already   boasted a significant investment in the area with its development   of the Google Brain, a neural network developed in-house. Gains   in AI research have been used to improve many areas of its   current business. DeepMind is focused on improvements in general   AI research, without any specific business objectives. That said,   Google will use every opportunity to apply research gains to   business uses.Is Intel's acquisition of Nervana a threat to NVIDIA? Image     source: Intel.Intel will take the fight to NVIDIAIntel(NASDAQ: INTC) has made a number of acquisitions as well. Saffron   specialized in cognitive computing, combining data analytics with   deep learning; this relates directly to Intel's efforts in the   same area. Indisys provided natural-language recognition, gesture   recognition, and virtual-assistant technologies, but also created   user interfaces for unmanned drones. Itseez focused on software   for the Internet of Things (IoT), cameras, drones, and autonomous   driving. Movidius brought computer-vision hardware for drones and   cameras; it also provided system-on-a-chip (SoC) technology for   accelerating computer vision, as well as deep-learning   capability. These companies integrate directly into Intel's   RealSense brand for drones and virtual reality, and bolster its   IoT business.The most significant of Intel's acquisitions, however, may be   that of deep-learning start-up Nervana Systems. With a reported   price of $408 million, this company is attempting to reduce   machine learning to the size of a computer chip. Intel competitorNVIDIA(NASDAQ: NVDA) has seen its stock price triple in 2016, as its   graphics processing units (GPUs) become the chip of choice for   companiestraining AI systems. If Intel can succeed at reducing machine learning to a level   that could reside on a processor, that would be a significant   boost to its business and a potentially troubling development for   NVIDIA.As the battle for AI supremacy continues, we will likely see   more consolidation in the industry, as tech giants try to gain an   edge in this nascent technology. Success in the field will likely   depend on successful integration of these acquisitions into   existing business lines.

1 Thing NVIDIA Investors Should Worry About;2/3/2017;"WhenIntel(NASDAQ: INTC) acquired artificial intelligence (AI) start-up   Nervana Systems late last year, at first glance it appeared to be   another big tech company jumping on the AI bandwagon. A closer   look, however, reveals a very specific motivation. And it could   spell trouble for NVIDIA.NVIDIA GPU is the go-to chip to train AI systems -- for now.     Image source: NVIDIA.makeArticleAd();Intel has seen the market for its CPU chips shrink along with   the worldwide shipment of personal computers, which fell an   estimated 6% in 2016, the fifth consecutive year of declines.   CompetitorNVIDIA(NASDAQ: NVDA) , meanwhile, has seen the market explode for its   graphic processing units (GPU), along with its stock price, which   tripled in 2016.Though once used solely to render graphics in video games,   NVIDIA's GPUs have become the go-to chip fortraining neural networksdue to the massive parallel processing capability. According to aFinancial Timesarticle in December, NVIDIA ""is widely credited with having   developed the best chips for training the artificial neural   networks"". The use of NVIDIA GPUs by data centers -- many   training AI systems -- helped revenue nearly triple in the most   recent quarter, to $240 million from just $82 million in the   prior year. Intel dominates the non-AI data center market,   selling nearly 99% of server chips used, and it now has its   sights on the nascent AI market as well.What is Intel doing?Late last year, Intel announced that it would release a server   chip specifically designed for AI applications -- the Xeon Phi,   aka Knights Mill. It indicated this processor would run 2.3 times   faster than NVIDIA's GPUs when used for deep learning. NVIDIA   countered, saying Intel deliberately used outdated benchmarks and   older versions of its products in the comparison. It claims that   had Intel used the updated benchmark, NVIDIA's offering is 30%   faster, and that its latest processor is 90% faster.Intel wants to ""unleash the next wave"" in artificial     intelligence. Image source: Intel.Intel's recent acquisition pushes it deeper into this market.   Nervana Systems took a different approach in its AI research. It   has created an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) for   its AI research called the Nervana Engine. Certain elements in a   GPU needed for graphics processing are not necessary in an AI   application. By stripping out unnecessary elements and   reengineering the memory, Nervana claims it can achieve 10   times increases in the computing power currently available on   GPUs. In an article from October 2015,Barron's[subscription required] explained:Their chip has thousands of little logic engines sitting     next to pools of memory, with a plethora of connections between     them. They claim the chip can perform in a fraction of the time     an image-recognition task that would take an Intel server chip     2,000 hours, or an Nvidia GPU, 33 hours. The key is that they     are designing for specific algorithms, so the chip's design is     more efficient than a general-purpose chip like Intel's or     NVIDIA's.Nervana Engine ASIC chips are designed to accelerate AI     system training. Image source: Nervana Systems.Intel will be integrating the new technology into its existing   chips in early 2017, so expect new offerings that will directly   challenge NVIDIA's GPUs in the AI space. Intel also claims that   by 2020, it will be able to train AI systems 100 times faster   than with today's technology, thoughsomehave deemed those goals very aggressive.It's not the only oneAnd Intel isn't the only one claiming improvements beyond what   GPUs currently accomplish.Alphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google has been conducting   research in the field ofAI for over five years. It announced it has a Tensor Processing Unit -- which is also   an ASIC -- capable of delivering performance that is 10 times   faster than any GPU running today, and that it has been running   TPUs in its data centers for more than a year.  They were   also used in the AI system Alpha Go, which recently made   headlines bydefeating many top rankedGoplayers. This provides a degree of confirmation of Nervana's claims   regarding the potential of such custom circuits.NVIDIA sees AI as a billion-dollar opportunity, though   data center revenue amounted to only $240 million in its most   recent quarter.  Intel's revenue from data centers,   meanwhile, amounted to $4.7 billion in its most recent   quarter. This illustrates that while gains in the market   would barely move the needle for Intel, they could be a big mover   for NVIDIA. While GPUs currently hold a commanding lead in the   training of AI systems, that could change quickly if the   technological advances claimed by Intel came to fruition.10 stocks we like better than IntelWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Amazon (AMZN) Q4 Earnings Beat, Revenues Miss Estimates;2/3/2017;"Amazon.com'sAMZNfourth-quarter 2016 earnings per share (EPS) of $1.54 cents surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.40.However, revenues of $43.74 billion lagged the consensus mark of $44.87 billion. The stock was down 4.15% in Thursday's after-hours trading in response to the lower-than-expected revenues, higher operating expenses and weak guidance.Over the last one year, the stock has however outperformed the Zacks  Electronic Commerce industry. It has gained 56.63% compared with the industry's gain of 47.98%.Last quarter, despite an increase in operating expenses, the company showed much better financial discipline. The spike in operating expenses was due to buildout of fulfillment centers, and increased spending on original TV shows and movies. Amazon Web Services (AWS) and India expansion-related expenses also resulted in higher spending.The North America and AWS segments contributed to profits while investments in international continued. Improvements in AWS were the result of operating efficiencies and increased utilization of assets.The numbers in detail-RevenuesAmazon reported revenues of $43.7 billion, up 33.7% sequentially and 22.4% from the year-ago quarter. Quarterly revenues were at the mid-point of the guidance range of $42-$45.5 billion.For the full year, revenues were $136 billion, up 27% from $107 billion in 2015.Both product and service sales were up sequentially and year over year. Service sales grew much stronger than product sales from the year-ago quarter (up 43.7% compared with product sales growth of 15.1%). Revenue distribution between the two was 70%/30%.The company generated record sales during this year's holiday season, primarily led by its devices strategy. Echo Dot, Fire TV Stick, Fire tablet and Amazon Echo topped the best-sellers list.Segment DetailsThe North America segment accounted for around 60% of sales, representing a sequential and year-over-year increase of 39% and 22%, respectively. The International segment accounted for 32%, up 31.6% sequentially and 17.9% year over year. The AWS segment was up 9.4% sequentially and a massive 47% year over year with revenue share at nearly 8%.North America: Media was up 30% sequentially and 7.1% year over year. EGM was up 40.9% sequentially and 24.8% year over year. Other was up 42.6% sequentially and 80.4% year over year.International: Media was up 35.6% sequentially and 2.6% from last year. Sales from EGM were up 30.5% sequentially and 23.8% from last year. Other revenue was up 19.35% sequentially and 17.9% year over year.AWS: The business contributed $3.5 billion in the fourth quarter. AWS is gaining momentum with customers including McDonald's, Workday, Capital One, Salesforce, GE Oil & Gas, Kellogg's, Brooks Brothers, Ferrara Candy Company, GPT Group, Hoya Corporation, Lionsgate, Macmillan Publishers India, RWE Czech Republic, and Bart & Associates Inc. Amazon ended the quarter with 42 available zones across 16 infrastructure regions. The Mumbai (India) region was added in the third quarter, which became the sixth region in the Asia Pacific. Amazon remains the cloud infrastructure leader, well ahead of MicrosoftMSFT, International Business Machines CorporationIBMand AlphabetGOOGL.Gross MarginGross margin was down 122 basis points (bps) sequentially but up 189 bps year over year to 33.8%. Sequential variations in gross margin were largely mix-related, although increased investments were also a factor. Growth in AWS had a positive impact on margin. Pricing is also an important factor, given the increase in product categories all over the world and Amazon's strategy of heavily discounting products and services while building a position in any market. Third party sites did better than retail, which was also a positive.Gross profit dollars were up 29.8% from last year. The consistently rising gross profit dollars from the year-ago period reflects the success of Amazon's strategy.Net income was up 197.2% sequentially and 55.4% year over year.Operating MetricsAmazon's operating expenses of $13.5 billion were up 24.3% sequentially and 31.4% from the year-ago quarter. Amazon's heavy investing activities (headcount, fulfillment centers, content, etc) over the past few quarters have been driving up its costs. Cost of goods sold increased 121 bps sequentially as a percentage of sales with marketing expense increasing 45 bps and technology and content increasing just 5 bps. All other expenses declined as a percentage of sales.The net result was an operating margin of 2.9%, up 111 bps sequentially but down 23 bps from the year-ago quarter. Amazon reported an operating profit of $1.3 billion compared with $575 million in the previous quarter and $1.1 billion in the year-ago quarter.North America segment's operating margin of 3.1% was up 176 bps sequentially and 15 bps year over year. The International segment's operating margin of 4.07% shrank 315 bps sequentially but was up 100 bps from the year-ago quarter. Operating margin of AWS was 26.2%, down 46 bps sequentially but up 207 bps year over year.Consolidated segment operating income (CSOI) was up 111 bps sequentially but down 23 basis points from the year-ago quarter.Net IncomeAmazon generated fourth quarter net income of $749 million, or 1.7% of sales, compared with $252 million, or 0.8% in the previous quarter and $500 million, or 1.3% of sales in the same quarter last year. There were no one-time items in the fourth quarter. Therefore, the GAAP EPS was the same as the pro forma EPS of $1.54 compared with 52 cents in the previous quarter and $1 in the year-ago quarter.Amazon.com, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS   SurpriseAmazon.com, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS   Surprise|Amazon.com, Inc. QuoteBalance Sheet and Cash FlowAmazon ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments balance of $19.81 billion, down $146 million sequentially. The company generated $10.65 billion of cash from operations, spending $2.01 billion on fixed assets (including internal-use software and website development costs) and $3 million on acquisitions. Principal repayments of capital lease obligations were $1 billion in the fourth quarter.GuidanceManagement provided guidance for the first quarter of 2017. Revenues are expected to include a 250 bps positive FX impact and come in around $33.25-33.75 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $35.83 billion. Operating income is expected to come in at approximately $250-$900 million.To ConcludeRetail: Amazon's retail business remains very hard to beat on price, choice, convenience, you name it. The company has a solid loyalty system in Prime and its FBA strategy, and content addition continues to add selection to Prime memberships. If Amazon is able to replicate its domestic success internationally, investors could see far more growth. At the moment, international contributes a third of revenue but generates just a fraction of profits.AWS:Amazon Web Services on the other hand is the cash cow for Amazon. The business generates much higher margins than retail, so it has a positive impact on Amazon's profitability. We remain optimistic about the functionality, partner ecosystem and the experience AWS offers and believe this will lead to continued customer wins.IoT:Amazon has converted the nascent smart home market into a potential area of growth, in a very short time, backed by its Alexa-powered Echo devices. With third-party partnerships, Amazon is making Alexa the central point of connecting IoT devices used in any household. , It appears that Echo is well poised to penetrate every stream of business on the back of Amazon's robust performance.The company has accelerated signing on third-party device makers, so that these companies integrate Amazon's voice assistant - Alexa - which brings them into the respective eco systems.Currently, Alexa is equipped with thousands of skills and can connect to any stream of business. We believe that Amazon has just started to unfold what it could do with Alexa.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderCurrently Amazon has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Best Place to Start Your Stock SearchToday, you are invited to download the full list of 220 Zacks Rank #1 """"Strong Buy"""" stocks - absolutely free of charge.

Zillow In Position To Dominate Online Real Estate Ad Market;2/3/2017;"Zillow Group(Z), operator of the online house-hunting network that dwarfs all   competitors, has the inside track for winning a dominant share of   real estate agents' digital ad spending.""Their competitive position is quite strong,"" said Macquarie   Capital analyst Tom White.While the homes-for-sale data that underpins sites like   Zillow and Realtor aren't proprietary, White notes that   Zillow ""is out-innovating its competitors in augmenting that   basic listings data"" with other data, including listings of homes   not for sale, and by investing heavily in mobile.makeArticleAd();Citing comScore data, Zillow says its five brands account   for nearly two-thirds of the total online real estate   category and nearly three-quarters of the mobile segment.Yet White notes that there's ""a big disconnect"" between   Zillow's majority share of traffic and its slice of the real   estate advertising pie.Turning clicks into commission for agents and more ad dollars   for Zillow turns out to be easier said than done.Fast CompanyA partial explanation is that a big slice of real estate   advertising dollars is going to companies that aren't direct   competitors, likeFacebook(FB) andAlphabet's(GOOGL) Google.But the good news for Zillow is that it has been getting   better and better monetizing that traffic, growing sales by   upwards of 30% over the past year even as real estate agents have   lowered their overall spending on digital advertising.The bulk of Zillow's revenue - 70% in the last quarter - comes   from its Premier Agent program, where sales rose 32.5% from a   year ago. Real estate agents pay to have their picture,   credentials and ratings linked to Zillow's listings of homes for   sale, with up to four agents attached to each listing.Home shoppers who don't have an agent are likely to click on   those with high ratings and a history of similar   transactions, and that's exactly what Zillow wants to   see.Zillow has a strategy to help accelerate the real estate   industry's evolution to the survival of the fittest. Zillow is   looking to help the best real estate agents - the ones who   can best capitalize on the leads that Zillow generates and will   therefore pay the highest ad prices - to extend their   domination.[ibdchart symbol=""Z"" type=""daily"" size=""threequarter""   position=""rightchart"" ]""We are accelerating the broader trend   across the real estate agent population of higher-producing   agents gaining market share from those who are less productive,""   Chief Executive Spencer Rascoff said on a November   conference call with analysts.Agent OverhaulRascoff also noted that Zillow overhauled the ways it sells   ads to its Premier Agents last quarter. Under its old model,   Zillow came up with a price for a fixed number of ad impressions   based on a ZIP code's characteristics.But Rascoff noted that the fixed-price model sometimes sold   out impressions in desirable ZIP codes, requiring the company to   call up agents to increase ad prices. So now prices will be set   dynamically, based on the total dollars agents budget to   advertise on Zillow in a given ZIP code.The goal is ""to have the marketplace"" determine ad costs,   Rascoff told analysts.Zillow, which reports fourth-quarter earnings on Tuesday,   advised analysts on its November call that its guidance   carried an extra margin of error because of the nationwide   rollout of the new pricing strategy.Analysts expect the company to earn 11 cents a share vs. a   one-cent loss a year ago, as revenue rises 31% to $222 million.   In 2017 revenue is expected to grow 23% to $1.038 billion.Smaller Number, But Bigger SpendingThe number of agents advertising on Zillow declined modestly   in the third quarter to 89,147, but that was part of a planned   shakeout. At the same time, the number of advertisers spending at   least $5,000 per month rose 79% from a year ago, while average   spending per agent rose 46%.IBD'S TAKE:Zillow shares showed promise in early December, after     forming acup-with-handleand starting to break out. But shares retreated into a flat     base and remain there. Check out IBD Stock Checkup to see     the top companies in theInternet-Content group.Tuesday's results also will provide a checkup on two other new   initiatives: a partnership with Facebook and Zillow's first   effort to monetize the sell-side of the housing market.Zillow is partnering with Facebook to offer a precision-ad   targeting program that enables real estate agents to connect on   Facebook with home shoppers who are using its site or   Trulia, its sister property acquired in early 2015.Zillow also announced its Seller Boost program in October,   involving the placement of Premier Agent ads on listings of its   huge inventory of homes not for sale to provide potential   leads for agents if the homeowner decides to sell.Leveraging The NetworkAt the same time, Zillow is trying to leverage its large   network of users - 164.5 million in the seasonally slower   third quarter - to get a broader slice of advertising   dollars.Zillow's marketplace for mortgages, which connects homebuyers   to area mortgage lenders much likeLendingTree(TREE), generated $19.8 million in revenue in the third quarter,   up 57% from a year ago.The traffic at Zillow properties is roughly triple that of its   closest direct competitor, Realtor.com, which was acquired byNews Corp.(NWSA) in November 2014.Thanks to the merger with Trulia, Zillow removed a major   competitor. Meanwhile fears that News Corp. might jump-start the   growth and promotion of Realtor.com have been mostly   unfounded, Macquarie analyst White said.Bigger Slice Of PieBy some measures, though, Zillow has a growing slice of a pie   that has been shrinking in recent years. Borrell Associates   estimates that real estate agents spent $7.7 billion on digital   ads in 2016, down from $9 billion in 2014. Some 78% of real   estate ad spending was done online in 2016, Kip Cassino,   Borrell's executive vice president of research, told IBD.The decline in spending partly reflects a relatively modest   pace of home sales, especially among millennials, Cassino says.   The other reason is that agents ""have become more discerning   about how they spend,"" using Google keywords, social media or   unpaid search engine optimization strategies.Still, digital spending, including spending on related   technologies, has been growing as a percentage of agents'   marketing budgets, Zillow says.Rascoff's focus is making sure Zillow is ""well-positioned for   the billions of dollars of real estate agent ad spend which will   surely migrate on to the internet over the next couple of   years, and making sure that we've the right ad model to   capture the lion's share of that.""After several days of losses, shares of Zillow reversed course   late last week. The stock ended trading Friday up 1.6% to 35.93   and climbed another 1.9% Monday to finish the day at 36.62, right   on its 50-day moving averageRELATED:Analyst Sees 'Modest' Earnings Upside For     ZillowZillow Group Challenged By Rising Interest     Rates, Says StifelZillow Group Stock Turbocharged By     High-Spending 'Super Agents'"

How Social Media Changed Super Bowl Commercials Forever;2/2/2017;"In these times of deep political division, America's great unifier is visible on the horizon. Regardless of your partisan identity, race, ethnicity, or religion, if you live in the United States, you are probably going to watch the 51stannual Super Bowl this Sunday. Heck, even if you hate football, it is a great excuse to have some friends over and gorge yourself with French onion dip and potato chips.But what is more American than apathetic binge eating? Well, commercials of course! As if viewers were not satisfied with an hour-long, ultra-violent faceoff between the world's top athletes, the Super Bowl is traditionally paired with interesting and unique commercials to ensure that we do not take our eyes off the television for one second.It makes sense that a company would want to put their best advertisement out during the Super Bowl; the big game is always the most-watched television event of the year in the U.S., and based on last year's 112 million viewers, we can expect more than a third of the entire country to be tuned in on Sunday.(Also Read:51 Essential Houston Facts to Get You Ready for   Super Bowl LI)With that said, the advertising industry as a whole is not what it once was. Over the past decade or so, advertisers have been forced to adapt to new consumer behaviors, and that has meant the rise of viral marketing and digital ad campaigns.Super Bowl commercials have not been immune from these changes. Viewers simply do not want to miss any of the big commercials, and with plenty of trips to the fridge and bathroom on the average Super Bowl watcher's schedule, companies have started using the internet as a means of distributing their Super Bowl ads.While it is nothing new for Super Bowl spots to begin widespread circulation after the game itself, the latest phenomena has been the pre-releasing of commercials before the actual event. Many companies are now debuting their Super Bowl ads more than a week out from the game and pairing their release with a massive social media marketing campaign.Indeed, the rise of social media has coincided with an adapted Super Bowl commercial tradition. These days, companies want people to buzzing about their commercials well before they are set to debut. In fact, a recentNew York Timesarticlehighlights the fact that companies are spending even more money for online marketing on top of the cost of airing the commercial during the game.Mary Scott, a president at sports and entertainment marketing agency UEG, toldThe Timesthat she recommends clients spend at least 25% of the cost of the Super Bowl spot on their digital marketing rollout of the commercial.The cost of a 30-second advertisement during this year's Super Bowl rose to an astounding $5 million, and that means companies will want to get the most value for their investment. ""There's become more of a game around the game in terms of ensuring that really pays off in a big way,"" said Scott.""The game around the game"" that Scott is referring to includes massive social media exposure to the commercials in advance of the Super Bowl. For instance, a company may upload the spot to YouTube before spreading it around FacebookFBand TwitterTWTR.Social media also gives consumers new ways to react to the advertisements. Discussion about the spots plays out online, and it does not take much for these massive companies to become trending topics. Furthermore, Alphabet Inc.GOOGLis celebrating 10 years of YouTube's AdBlitz competition, a voting system that allows users to support their favorite spots.Some may argue that the pre-game debuts ruin some of the fun related to watching the Super Bowl, but if I point you to our piece that highlights some of the commercials that are already out, are you seriously not going to watch them? You are, and you can check them out here:Preview The Super Bowl Commercials That Are   Already Out.Personally speaking, I am happy about this trend. I plan on having some people over for the game this year, and it is always difficult to get people to stay quiet during the commercials, especially when the drinks start getting finished. I will be checking out as many as I can beforehand.Long-Term Buys You Won't See in the NewsThe stocks you see in today's headlines may not be in the news tomorrow or next week.

Google Earnings: The Market Has Made The Same Mistake Twice;2/2/2017;"Google Earnings (Shutterstock photo)As a general rule, the market is pretty good about learning from its mistakes. After all, there is nothing like a hefty loss to teach traders what not to do.That is a simple fact that must be borne in mind when looking for patterns in pricing; if the pattern involves a reaction to news that was ultimately proven wrong, it is unlikely to repeat very often, and the few opportunities when it does should be grabbed with both hands.makeArticleAd();That is what makes Google parent company Alphabet (GOOG:GOOGL) look like such a good buy after its reaction to Q4 earnings.As you can see from the chart below, prior to last week’s earnings report Google (I’m sorry but I just can’t bring myself to call the company “Alphabet”) had dropped sharply on earnings misses contained in two of the previous three releases, in April and October.On both of those occasions, though, the big drop in price was, with the benefit of 20/20 hindsight, an opportunity to buy the stock at a discount. There are different circumstances this time around, of course, but the dynamic that has made negative reactions to earnings in the past opportunities is still in place, so the end result is likely to be the same.The biggest problems with the Q4 results as far as traders were concerned, it seems, were that cost per click was down, and operating costs had risen to the point where earnings per Class A share (EPS) of $9.36 fell short of the Street’s estimates of around $9.64. Still, revenues of $26.06 billion beat the estimated $25.26 billion.There was also a concern lurking in the background regarding Google taking on both Amazon (AMZN)’s Echo and Apple (AAPL)’s iPhone with recent hardware launches. Google said that they were pleased with the reaction to both Google Home and the Pixel phone without going into specifics, but doubts about the wisdom of the strategy persist.I actually believe that Google has a chance of limited success in each case. The Pixel will be the most uphill struggle as the iPhone’s dominance of the mobile phone market is well established. Most estimates of sales of the phone so far are around 1 million, which hardly puts a dent in the iPhone, but may prove to be enough of a base to make the Pixel profitable as a niche product.Home has an easier, more logical path to success as Google is the natural choice of those looking for what is, essentially, a free-standing search engine.Ultimately, though, neither Home nor Pixel is going to be the driver of the recovery in the stock price that history suggests will come soon.First, the increase in operating costs that Google reported seems, on a breakdown of the numbers, to be the result of investment in the core business. Losses in what the company calls “Other Bets,” things like “Nest” and self driving cars, were actually reduced somewhat in the fourth quarter, but there was significant progress on the autonomous vehicle front.The possibilities of that field are endless and Google, along with Tesla (TSLA) and Apple, are generally seen as the leaders in driverless car research and technology.The other issue, of falling cost per click (CPC), is also not what it seems on the surface. It reflects a continuing move to mobile that results in that metric falling, but the volume of clicks increasing. The same issue was, in part, responsible for the April and October drops in GOOG after earnings, and the chart tells the story of how long it was until investors realized that volume more than offset falling CPC.Looking at Google’s results and the market reaction to them, I get a sense of déjà vu. We have actually been here before, twice, and each time the drop in GOOG gave investors a chance to buy cheaply. It seems that in this case the market is still learning from its mistake and over time the outcome here is most likely to be the same."

Domino's (DPZ) Expands Ordering Facilities on Messenger;2/2/2017;"One of the world leaders in pizza delivery and digital ordering platforms,Domino's Pizza, Inc.DPZ, is further expanding its digital ordering capabilities on Facebook Inc.'sFBMessenger.makeArticleAd();Until now, customers with a Pizza Profile were restricted to placing their most recent order or Easy Order via Facebook Messenger. Domino's went one step ahead by becoming the first national pizza chain to have full ordering capabilities on Messenger. Customers can now place any order for any menu item on the Messenger. Now, they won't need any Pizza Profile and can place orders through the company's enhanced ordering assistant bot - Dom.The enhancement comes just in time for one of the company's busiest day of the year - Football's final Sunday. Domino's expects sales to be five times more than on a typical Sunday. Thus, making ordering more convenient for customers could further add to the sales.The digital wave has hit the U.S. fast casual restaurant sector. Hence, an increasing number of restaurants are implementing technology to enhance guest experience. Similarly, Domino's is also investing heavily in technology-driven initiatives like digital ordering to boost sales. The company keeps on adding various ordering apps and platforms to its digital capabilities.In fact, Domino's lineup of AnyWare ordering capabilities currently has a total of 10 platforms that include Alphabet, Inc.'sGOOGLGoogle Home, Amazon.com, Inc.'sAMZNEcho, and ordering via a Pizza emoji on text.Notably, digital leadership is helping the company expand its brand in the domestic market as well as overseas. This is one of the reasons Domino's shares have widely outperformed the broader Zacks categorizedRetail-Restaurantsindustry over the past year. While the stock gained 50.3%, the broader industry declined 3.6% in the same time period.Although the company's initiatives such as implementation of technology and re-imaging of restaurants offer long-term advantages, the costs related to them are expected to continue dampening margins in the near term. Further, the company's wide international presence makes it highly vulnerable to foreign exchange headwinds, while a soft industry backdrop is putting pressure on the top line.Nevertheless, going forward, the extended ways to order a pizza are poised to keep Domino's in the forefront of digital ordering and customer convenience. Also, this should help in improving the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company's sales trends and enhance its competitive positioning.You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank   (Strong Buy) stocks here.Zacks' Best Private Investment IdeasIn addition to the recommendations that are available to the public on our website, how would you like to follow all Zacks' private buys and sells in real time?Our experts cover all kinds of trades… from value to momentum . . . from stocks under $10 to ETF and option moves . . . from stocks that corporate insiders are buying up to companies that are about to report positive earnings surprises.

Facebook (FB) Tops on Q4 Earnings Driven by Mobile & Video;2/2/2017;"Facebook, Inc.'sFBearnings streak continues with yet another better-than-expected quarterly performance. Facebook's fourth-quarter 2016 adjusted earnings of $1.24 per share and revenues of $8.8 billion easily topped the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.11 and $8.5 billion. This is Facebook's sixth successive quarter of earnings and revenue beat.Mobile and live video efforts are paying off big time for the social media giant. Instagram is also emerging as a major cash cow with over 500,000 advertisers. CEO Mark Zuckerberg continued to emphasize on bringing more and more video content on to the platform. It has been investing on original content and said that it will keep doing the same this year as well.As expected, Facebook continues to maintain a cautious stance on revenue and ad growth. Facebook again stated that ad revenues will continue to grow but will face tougher year-over-year comparisons in the current year. Moreover, as Facebook continues to ramp up investments, costs will increase. The company plans to go on a hiring spree this year and especially recruit engineers, which will further add to its costs. Well it's a no brainer that Facebook(or even any other company for that matter) will keep up with those dizzying initial growth rates as it gets bigger.Quarterly Numbers in DetailsFacebook reported non-GAAP earnings of $1.21 in the quarter, up 124% year over year. Revenues, excluding the impact of year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates basis, increased 51% year over year.Facebook's consistently expanding user growth remains one of its biggest growth catalysts.  Facebook's monthly active users (MAUs) were up 17% year over year to a staggering 1.86 billion. In addition, at the end of the quarter, mobile MAUs were 1.74 billion, representing 21% year-over-year growth. Daily Active Users (DAUs) were 1.23 billion, reflecting 18% growth year over year while mobile DAUs were 1.15 billion, up 23% year over year.Breaking down revenue components, advertising revenues were $8.629 billion, surging 53% year over year. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates, revenues from advertising also increased 54% year over year. Advertising revenues were driven by increasing mobile engagement, higher number of marketers, and continuing investment in new products.Mobile ad revenues in the quarter were $7.2 billion (up 61% year over year), contributing 84% to total ad revenues. Ad impressions grew 49%, driven by surging mobile ad impressions. Average price per ad increased 3% from the year-ago quarter. Average revenue per user was $4.83Payments and other fees decreased 12% year over year to $180 million in the reported quarter owing to a reduction in payment revenues related to PC games. Management expects revenues from this segment to face further decline as PCs lose market share.On the cost front, cost & expenses increased 29.3% to $4.2 billion, driven by increases in workforce and marketing expenses. However, robust revenue growth provided enough cushion to operating margins.Non-GAAP operating income of $5.6 billion grew 58.9% year over year.Facebook, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS     SurpriseFacebook, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS   Surprise|Facebook, Inc. QuoteBalance Sheet & Cash FlowFacebook exited the quarter with cash & cash equivalents and marketable securities of $29.4 billion, up 59.7% year over year.The company generated nearly $16.1 billion of cash flow from operating activities in 2016 compared with $10.3 billion in 2015. Free cash flow was $11.6 billion compared with $7.8 billion last year. The company incurred capital expenditure of $4.5 billion in the year.OutlookNon-GAAP expenses are projected to increase in a band of 47% to 57% while capex is expected to be $7 billion to $7.5 billion. The company expects 2017 to be a year of aggressive investments. The company plans to build more data centers as well as recruitmore engineers to fuel its AI & AR/VR technology ambitions.Stock-based compensation is estimated in a range of $3.9 billion-$4.1 billion. The company expects amortization expenses in 2016 to be within $700 million-$800 million.Final WordWe remain positive on Facebook as it works on becoming a tech powerhouse. Its chief Mark Zuckerberg aspires to make Facebook much more than just a social media platform.  Last year, we got a glimpse of what Zuckerberg intends to do. He is betting big on AR/VR. At the company's Oculus Developer conference held in October last year, Facebook announced another $250 million investment to develop VR content ecosystem. It also announced some new products including Santa Cruz, a cheaper standalone VR headset with inside-out-tracking.AI and AR/VR technology are fast emerging as lucrative business opportunities.  According to a recent IDC report, global revenues of the AR/VR market are expected to grow at a CAGR of 181.3% from $5.2 billion in 2016 to over $162 billion in 2020. Recently, Facebook split Oculus into two separate units. While one division will focus on developing VR for mobile, the other one will focus on VR for PCs. He has roped in Hugo Barra to spearhead the company's VR efforts as well as head Oculus. A few days back, Facebook said that it will spend over $3 billion in the next 10 years on VR.However, a couple of days back, Facebook was ordered by a Dallas court to pay $500 million to ZeniMax for copyright infringement. ZeniMax has slapped a $2 billion lawsuit against Oculus accusing it of stealing its intellectual property to boost its own VR research.The company is also aggressively working on monetizing its subsidiaries, Messenger, Oculus and WhatsApp. Chatbots and ""conversational commerce"" are likely to be the strategies for Messenger and WhatsApp.It is also making its presence felt in enterprise software by launchingWorkplace. Facebook also upped its ante in the social commerce area with the launch ofMarketplace. It also acquiredNascent Objectsto boost its hardware efforts.However, Facebook was criticized for the dissemination of fake news on its platform, which said to have one of the reasons behind Donald Trump's win. Facebook has since then taken initiatives to curb the menace. It is availing the help of third parties for better verification of news and also considering the option of ""labeling stories"" that are flagged. Facebook said it will also scrutinize ads that promote bogus stories for monetary gains. Lastly, it said that it will work with the entire news industry to improve its fact checking systems.As of now, all of these appear to be terrific growth engines but it will be one Herculean task for the company to actually make all of it work. Moreover, intensifying competition for users & ad dollars from the likes of AlphabetGOOGL, Snapchat and Twitter Inc.TWTR, and increasing investments threaten to thwart its growth prospects.At present, Facebook carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Given the phenomenal growth in mobile ad business and video efforts, Facebook has vastly outperformed the broader market. In the past one year, Facebook's shares have generated a return of 18.89%, compared with the ZacksInternet Servicesindustry's gain of 4.43%.A stock worth consideration in the tech space is Jabil Circuit IncJBL, which carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Better Buy: Facebook, Inc. vs Alphabet;2/1/2017;"Digital advertising is expected to surpass television   advertising in the U.S. this year -- that is, if it hasn't   already. The two main beneficiaries of the growth in digital   advertising areFacebook(NASDAQ: FB) andAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) , which owns Google.Image source: FacebookmakeArticleAd();Indeed, the two companies completely dominate the digital   advertising market, combining to take about 60% of the market.   Both companies are growing rapidly, especially considering their   size, but which is the better buy right now?A look at valuationBoth Facebook and Alphabet trade for relatively high   valuations, which would leave them off the buy list of many   investors. But both companies arguably deserve their high   valuations because of their rapid growth and the industry trend   supporting them.CompanyP/E (forward)P/S (TTM)P/FCF (TTM)PEGFacebook24.915.243.20.95Alphabet20.06.824.81.06Source: Yahoo.Investors are valuing Facebook's expected earnings and   earnings growth near the same levels as Alphabet, but that puts a   premium on Facebook's trailing-12-month sales and free cash flow   compared to Alphabet's.Facebook does sport a significantly larger operating margin   compared with Alphabet (45%, versus 26% in the third quarter),   which makes its sales more valuable, but no more than twice as   valuable. Likewise, Facebook's free cash flow doesn't deserve to   be given nearly twice the value as Alphabet's.For investors looking for a growth stock with a good   valuation, Alphabet shares definitely take the title here.Image source: AlphabetWhat about growth?A great growth stock, however, will produce significant   earnings growth for its shareholders. You'll notice the one   valuation where Facebook outshines Alphabet (albeit just barely)   is in its PEG ratio -- the only metric shown that accounts for   growth.Indeed, analysts expect Facebook to continue growing rapidly   over the next five years, with a compound annual earnings growth   rate of 35.5%. Analysts expect Alphabet to produce EPS growth of   just 18.6% on average through 2021. That's nearly half the rate   of Facebook's growth -- and that's what you get for the premium   price you'll pay for Facebook.Facebook's management recently warned that advertising revenue   growth on its flagship platform will slow about midway through   2017, but it still has several other major potential revenue   drivers.Instagram is still in the early days of advertising, and   analysts at Credit Suisse estimate it could generate $6.4 billion   in 2017 (double 2016) and $12 billion by 2021. For reference,   Facebook is expected to produce $27.3 billion in sales this   year.Facebook's Oculus just started selling hardware a bit over a   year ago, and Mark Zuckerberg expects VR to be the next big   computing platform. Not to mention Facebook has 1 billion users   for both Messenger and WhatsApp left to monetize.Meanwhile, Alphabet's growth will come mainly from the   continued trend of growing digital advertising spend, which   largely benefits Google. YouTube may also help drive revenue   growth, but it's a much more mature advertising platform compared   to Instagram and carries lower margins than Google's main ad   products. While the company has several moonshots that could turn   out to be huge profit machines in the future, even Alphabet's   small wins are dwarfed by the size of Google.For investors looking for a growth stock with the most   potential for growth, Facebook is a better buy than Alphabet.Find out why Facebookis one of the 10 best stocks to buy nowMotley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more   than a decade beating the market.

Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock Won’t Stop at $12;2/1/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOnce left for dead, semiconductor giantAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMD), has come back over the past two years, proving the doubters wrong. With gains of 400% over the past year, AMD stock haspunished those who bet against it. But is it now time to take profits?makeArticleAd();Source:Matthew Rutledge via FlickrNope.AMD stock had a slow start to 2017, off about 6% before Tuesday night's fourth-quarter earnings report, is back in the black thanks to a Wednesday surge after showing off some of the operational dominance it sported in a rip-roaring 2016.Expectation for the QuarterFor the quarter that ended December, Wall Street expected the company to report a loss of 2 cents per share on revenues of $1.07 billion. AMD beat on both fronts, recording revenues of $1.11 billion and a loss of just 1 cent per share.Recent results fromIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) hinted that Advanced Micro might be in for a Street-beating quarter.7 Stocks to Buy That Could Double by 2018On Friday John Vinh, analyst at Pacific Crest noted that Intel's results, which reflected less-bad personal computer trends, suggests strong growth for the sector. Notably, Vinh cited AMD as benefiting from ""strength in gaming and high-end PCs."" To that end, the analysts also said the improvements in high-end PCs could reduce concerns about high-end GPU inventory at desktop graphics card manufacturers.Well, a beat is what we got, and that came on the power of AMD's graphics chips, which saw revenues grow 15% year-over-year.The Key to AMD: GPUsGPU, or Graphics Processing Unit, is a big business for AMD. Those chips render images, animations and video for display on computer's screens. And the strength of that business has been a key component of AMD's turnaround. In the third quarter, reported in October, AMD posted a 23% year-over-year jump in revenue of $1.3 billion. The company benefited from strong growth in its popular Radeon line GPUs as revenue from that segment rose 11% year over year.This quarter, GPUs helped once more. Revenues in Computing and Graphics grew 28% year-over-year, thanks in part to higher average GPU selling prices.The company recently announced that its FirePro server GPUs have been selected byAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL) to power its cloud platform in 2017. All told, AMD's GPU strength has begun to gain traction in different verticals, which should help it narrow the market share gap with leaderNvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA).Bottom Line for AMD StockAMD's report was full of other positives, such as an expansion of gross margins from 30% to 32%, and slight gains in its Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom business (4%).Still, graphics and high performance are the name of the game.AMD stock surged 14% higher on Wednesday's reaction to fourth-quarter results, putting shares at highs last seen in 2017. The stock has returned more than 400% in 12 months - better than the 20% one-year gain in theS&P 500.And even still, AMD is showing that there's little let-up in the growth ramp.I expect AMD stock to reach $13 in 2017, delivering 22% gains on the back of greater GPU adoption and rising margins.As of this writing, Richard Saintvilus did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceWill the Apple Inc.

Facebook Inc (FB) TV App Is More Trouble Than You Think;2/1/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) opened for trade Feb. 1 at an all-time high - a market cap of $365 billion - on the strength of its dominance in mobile apps. But the big news is that Facebook is about to challenge the video league leaders with a mobile app for existing streaming boxes like theApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) TV. The question is, what will this do for FB stock?makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockMoving into TV through an app rather than a device makes sense, given the failure of the original Facebook phone and its overwhelming success with apps for others' phones.FB is already bankrolling the creation of videos for the video tab of itsmobile app.So where does Facebook fit its service into the evolving market, and what does its presence as a broadcaster mean to its claims not to be a media company?FB Stock: TV vs. PhoneThe company is already a presence in video thanks toFacebook Live, which allows live streaming of video on the service and it has aPresidential endorsement.10 Stocks to Buy That Already Make America GreatFB has prepared to offer longer videos by introducing ""mid-roll"" ads - ads that play in the middle of a video - to its line-up, making the service more TV-like.Over time, this might allow Facebook to compete directly withAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN),Netflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX) andAlphabet Inc's(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) YouTube in the growing market for streaming services.The problem is that there is a big difference between the experience you get on a mobile phone and what you want on a TV screen. A phone is active, a TV is passive. A phone may support videos of a few minutes, while people will watch TV for hours-and-hours.There is an assumption in the breathless reporting of Facebook's latest move that TV is easy; that it's just something you throw money at. Given the success of Netflix in generating subscribers and Emmys, and Amazon in generating Prime members and Oscar buzz, that is an easy mistake to make.Worth the Candle?For Facebook stock, this may not be as huge a deal as analysts think.Netflix revenue is only a fraction of FB stock's. Analysts expect Facebook to deliver over $27 billion in 2016 revenue when it reports after the market closes Feb. 1. This is against roughly $9 billion for Netflix. NFLX also brings just 3% of that revenue to the bottom line, while FB stock brings nearly one-third of revenue to its net income line.Entering the world of creating television poses another risk. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has repeatedly saidhe doesn't run a media company, that his is just a communications service. Media companies have responsibilities to truth and accuracy that, say, phone companies don't have - responsibilitiesthat can limit profitability.If Facebook is going to license content from media suppliers, whether live or scripted, it becomes a media company, subject to political and public scrutiny for its programming choices, on a global basis. This is a dance FB stock shareholders should fear, because it costs money to play, and carries risk.Can Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Jump Over These Hurdles?But Facebook may now have no choice in the matter. The big screen is the last frontier for internet services, it's where everyone is heading. FB stock does not want to be left behind.The Bottom Line on Facebook StockWhile most analysts are jumping for joy over the Facebook TV app news, I am a lot more cautious. This move has enormous implications for the entire company, for how it's perceived and (more important) what it costs to run.FB, like Alphabet, prefers to manage itself through algorithms. Algorithms scale in ways people do not. Facebook is starting to bow to pressure on the media front,hiring Campbell Brownto coordinate media alliances. Now it's about to become a TV network, or at least a streaming service.What will that mean to its profitability and growth? I think they both slow, because people aren't algorithms and talent has temper that code does not have. Politics can kill the media star.Dana Blankenhornis a financial and technology journalist.

Will the Apple Inc. HomeKit Beat Amazon’s Alexa? (AAPL);2/1/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) announced HomeKit - its strategy for becoming the center of the smart home - in June 2014.Amazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) revealed its Alexa-powered Echo smart speaker that November.makeArticleAd();Source: Apple/AmazonWhile there are currently several dozen HomeKit compatible smart home products, Amazon's Alexa is now connected to thousands of smart products and services and has spread from the Echo to third-party devices.On the surface, it looks as though Amazon has outmaneuvered and thoroughly trounced Apple. But despite the seemingly insurmountable lead and momentum, AAPL could still end up beating AMZN in this smart home race.Here's how.Apple Chose the Closed Approach With HomeKitApple tends to be extremely cautious. Its software is designed to be user-friendly and secure. iPhone apps can't just be downloaded from anywhere; they need to go through the official App Store and that requires approval by AAPL. Third-party hardware needs to be certified by Apple before it can be marketed as being iOS-compatible.It's that ""walled"" approach that hasmade the iPhone more securethan smartphones runningAlphabet Inc's(NASDAQ:GOOGL) Android operating system.With the iPhone and Siri - Apple's voice assistant - at the center of Apple's smart home strategy, that focus on security, compatibility and ease of use carried over toHomeKit. Manufacturers who want to make their smart devices HomeKit-compatible face a daunting series of requirements.Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Has a New Hero: Services!As pointed out in a recent Reuters article ondiffering smart home approaches, this includes being forced to buy a special HomeKit chip, being limited to approved (and more expensive than average) Bluetooth and Wi-Fi chips and even extends to manufacturing being limited to factories that are certified by Apple. End-to-end encryption is mandatory. Once a HomeKit product is ready, it faces extensive testing by Apple engineers to ensure compatibility.Thenit may be sold. That process alone can take three to five months.So you have additional costs, the procedural red tape and a delay. It's easy to understand whyApple currently lists only 75 or so HomeKit-compatible devices. And half of those are either different color options or regional variations of the same product.Amazon Alexa Is Open for BusinessAmazon took a radically different approach with its Echo speaker and Alexa. The company openly courted third-party companies to develop Alexa ""skills"" or software-enabled interactions with an Amazon Alexa-powered device.A skill can be the ability to tell Alexa to order anUber. It could also be telling Alexa to turn on your home's smart lights or to start your electric car. The process is simple. Amazon provides an example showinghow to build an Alexa skill in 60 minutes, and that includes the time needed to create a developer account. Submit the skill to AMZN for a quick verification, and it's published.That's how Amazon Alexa tripled its available skills in just three months last year, hitting 3,000 in September. If that sounds impressive, by CES 2017 in January, it had hit more than 7,000 Alexa skills.In addition to skills, Amazon also encourages third parties to integrate Alexa functionality into their products. That way, consumers get the Alexa experience without requiring an Echo speaker.That's a far easier process than Apple HomeKit certification. A ""Works with Alexa"" label takes about 10 days to obtain (it can even be issued by third party labs) and doesn't require special chips. According to the Reuters post, that has resulted in over 250 products that are Alexa-certified. We saw some of these at CES, including third-party speakers with Alexa and even home appliances with built-in Alexa capability.Smart Home Security: Apple Strength, Amazon Alexa VulnerabilityThe differing approaches of AMZN and AAPL have led to Alexa rapidly leaping to a massive lead over HomeKit in the smart home. However, there is one scenario where this could change rapidly.Security is increasingly becoming an issue for smart, connected devices. Apple's HomeKit approach emphasizes security, to the point of forcing the use of specialized chips and even certified manufacturing facilities.Amazon's Alexa strategy, on the other hand, leaves its platform relatively exposed. Amazon told Reuters it can't guarantee the security of third-party devices running Alexa. Those thousands of Alexa skills also integrate with third-party services that may have their own vulnerabilities.Trade of the Day: Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock No Longer a Home RunAll it would take is one catastrophic hacking for a PR disaster that turns consumers off Alexa. As CNET puts it in a review of thehacking risks for different smart home standards: ""Don't assume that a device has high security standards just because it works with Alexa.""Bottom LineThere's no disputing the fact that Amazon completely caught Apple and others off guard with its stealthy approach of sneaking Alexa into the home using its Echo connected speaker.Before the Echo, it was generally assumed that a smartphone would be the natural smart home controller. Making Alexa integration so open has also paid off for AMZN, resulting in a formidable lead in the smart home in a very short time. That lead may well turn into complete domination of the connected home. But Amazon's open approach may also prove to be its Achilles heel.Should hackers turn their attention to Amazon Alexa, the resulting headlines may flip the equation and put the much more secure Apple HomeKit on top in the long run.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceApple Inc.

What Apple's (AAPL) Earnings Say About The Future;2/1/2017;"When you regularly give your opinion on something as unpredictable as financial markets, gloating when you get something right is rarely a good idea. That is especially true when those opinions arearchivedfor all to see; it's too easy for a reader to check out that archive and find examples of when the market and hindsight combine to make even logical arguments seem foolish. I am fully aware of that, but when it comes to yesterday’searnings release from Apple(AAPL), I will still say""told you!""What really matters about the Apple release to investors is certainly not that I got it right, nor is it even that the tech giant returned to growth in revenue for the first time in a year, nor that the already great margins at Apple increased. Those last two are important, but necessarily backward looking, as all hard data in an earnings release are by definition.What matters most is what the report tells us about the future and there the message was somewhat mixed.makeArticleAd();The official guidance for Q1 2017 contained in the release fell just short of Wall Street’s expectations, which would normally be enough of a negative to more than offset the good historical results. In this case, though, a look at where Apple succeeded in Q4 2016 suggests that that guidance may just be another example of Apple’s past tendency to err on the side of under-promising and over-delivering when it comes to guidance. That is why, even though growth stalled last year, AAPL has beaten EPS expectations in three of the last four quarters.First and foremost, iPhone sales hit another record. That is particularly significant as not that long ago many were predicting that Google parent Alphabet (GOOG:GOOGL)’s move into the phone business would do Apple some serious harm. It looks now as if those saying that were about as accurate as those that maintained that the Windows phone from Microsoft (MSFT) or the Amazon (AMZN) Fire phone would be the next big thing.The fact is that the iPhone has an iconic status that looks almost impossible to challenge. Even phones that are objectively better in some ways, such as memory capacity, camera resolution, or speaker quality for example, cannot take market share. As Apple advances the iPhone with each release, beating them on those and other fronts becomes harder, but remains, according to the evidence so far, a pointless exercise. As long as that dynamic remains, holding Apple stock and adding to holdings at times of weakness still makes sense for investors.The weakness in this release was mainly in one area; iPad sales declined for the twelfth successive quarter. That, however, was offset to some extent by strong sales of Macs and Apple Watches. For the latter we are reliant on the word of Tim Cook as Apple doesn’t release a breakdown of watch sales, but, as I pointed out in the article referenced above, anybody who tried to buy a Series Two watch as a Christmas gift is probably aware that sales were at least more than Apple expected. None were available in any of the five states where I tried and most stores have just now received inventory.That shortage of watches, combined with Cook’s admission that they seriously underestimated demand for the iPhone 7 Plus, means that the record sales reported yesterday were achieved with a background of supply constraints. Given that and the fact that there was considerable growth in areas such as services and enterprise operations that still have lots of room for Apple to expand, the message underlying yesterday’s earnings is that, despite conventional wisdom, growth can still be achieved."

Advanced Micro (AMD) Q4 Loss In Line, View Disappoints;2/1/2017;"Advanced Micro DevicesAMDreported loss of 4 cents per share in fourth-quarter 2016, which matched the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Revenues increased 15.4% year over year to $1.11 billion primarily driven by higher GPU sales. However, revenues decreased 15.4% sequentially, primarily due to seasonally soft sales figures for its semi-custom System on Chips (SoCs). Notably, revenues were well above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.07 billion.AMD's shares rose 1.2% in after-hour trading. We note that shares have outperformed the ZacksElectronics Semiconductorsindustry over the last one year. While the industry gave a positive return of 67.2%, AMD gained a whopping 384.6%.The company benefited from strong demand for its graphics products. However, AMD's first-quarter 2017 will be impacted by seasonal weakness.RevenuesAdvanced Micro has two reportable segments -Computing and Graphics(focused on the traditional PC market) andEnterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom(focusing on adjacent high-growth opportunities). The details of these segments are discussed below:Computing and Graphics includes desktop and notebook processors and chipsets, discrete GPUs and professional graphics. This segment accounted for 54.2% of revenues and was up 27.1% sequentially and 27.7% year over year to $600 million.Notably, this segment's revenues grew on an annualized basis for the first time since 2011 as AMD's increased efforts to strengthen this particular segment paid off.Also, the segment posted the highest revenue in the last two years. Client revenues were the highest in the last seven quarters. Graphics processor revenues were also the highest in the last 11 quarters.During the reported quarter, strong adoption of the company's seventh generation notebook accelerated processing units (APUs) drove growth for the company. While desktop processor sales improved on a sequential basis, it declined on a year-over-year basis.The company also won a number of high-end design deals with global original equipment manufacturers over its Ryzen desktop processor that is expected to be launched in early Mar 2017.AMD's Polaris line of GPUs witnessed increased adoption in the fourth quarter. Also, Radeon Pro 400 mobile GPUs were launched, which are used in Apple'sAAPLpremium segment notebooks.The Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment includes server and embedded processors, dense servers, semi-custom SoC products, engineering services and royalties. This segment brought in the remaining 45.8% of revenues, down 39.4% sequentially but up 3.7% year over year to $506 million.The year-over-year increase was driven by higher sales of embedded processor sales and game consoles by MicrosoftMSFTand Sony that are powered by AMD's chips.The segment witnessed increased adoption in targeted markets. Notably, the company continues to gain traction in Naples, Italy.Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS   SurpriseAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. Price, Consensus and   EPS Surprise|Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. QuoteOperating ResultsNon-GAAP gross margin (excluding Wafer Supply Agreement (WSA) charges) was 31.7%, which expanded a whopping 494% sequentially but only 24% on a year-over-year basis.Adjusted operating expenses of $354 million increased 0.6% sequentially and 6.6% year over year.Non-GAAP operating loss was $3 million compared with a loss of $49 million in the year-ago quarter and loss of $293 million in the previous quarter.Mentor Graphics PartnershipAdvanced Micro's recent strategic partnership with Mentor Graphics on embedded technology will offer more choice to embedded developers in the x86 architecture high-performance computing segment. As more and more devices become interconnected, Advanced Micro's efforts to further strengthen its position in the burgeoning embedded markets will reap benefits. (Read:AMD and Mentor Graphics Ink Deal on Embedded Technology).Google DealIn November, the company announced that its FirePro server GPUs have been selected by AlphabetGOOGLto power its cloud platform in 2017. These developments are expected to help the company gain more traction in the GPU space and close in the market share gap with NVIDIA. (Read:AdvancedMicro Scales New Highs, Clinches Deal with Google).Balance SheetAdvanced Micro exited the fourth quarter with cash and cash equivalent balance of $1.26 billion, up $6 million from the previous quarter.During the quarter, the company raised approximately $1.4 billion in cash, before issuance costs, as a result of issuing $690 million of common stock and $700 million of Convertible Notes due 2026.Inventory was $751 million, up 10.8% on a year-over-year basis but down 2.7% sequentially. Total debt (short term and long term) was $1.43 billion, down $0.2 billion sequentially.GuidanceManagement expects first-quarter 2017 revenues to decrease 11% sequentially (+/- 3%), primarily due to seasonal weakness in semi-custom and graphics products. If the company manages to achieve the mid-point of its guidance, it will translate to 18% growth in revenues on a year-over-year basis.Gross margin is likely to be 33% while non-GAAP operating expenses are estimated to be $360 million.On the other hand, interest expense, taxes and others will amount to $30 million. Inventories are expected to remain flat on a sequential basis.Our TakeThe decent fourth-quarter results reflected AMD's improving position in key markets with the introduction of several APUs and GPUs. Moreover, partnerships with the likes of Google for the supply of Radeon Pro GPUs and FirePro server GPUs are positive in our view.Notably the company trails NVIDIA as the second-largest manufacturer of graphics chips for high-end computing and is gradually gaining traction in the space.Additionally, upcoming products like Ryzen and Zen are expected to drive the top line going ahead.Zacks RankAdvanced Micro has Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank stocks here.Zacks' Top 10 Stocks for 2017In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2017?Who wouldn't?

Amgen, Inc. (AMGN) Q4 Earnings Preview;2/1/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAs it's customary withAmgen, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMGN), the biotech giant topped analysts' expectation in each of the first three quarters of 2016. Chances are that it'll top expectations once more when it reports its fourth-quarter and full-year 2016 figures on Feb. 2. So if you're following AMGN stock, you don't need to worry about Amgen's profits.makeArticleAd();Source:Richard Masoner via FlickrInstead, you'll want to watch the following items Thursday when Amgen reports its fourth-quarter results:#1: Enbrel Sales TrendCompared to the third quarter of 2015, Amgen reported flat product sales in Q3 2016. This was mostly due to its top-selling drug, Enbrel, losing ground. Sales for the drug had increased 24% in Q1 and 10% in Q2, but in the third quarter, total Enbrel sales were $1.452 billion, versus $1.459 billion in the year-ago period.The problem doesn't seem to be seasonal fluctuation, considering that Enbrel sales grew by 30% in Q3 2015, compared to Q3 2014.7 Awful Stocks You Need To Ditch Right AwayThe problem is that competition is catching up. Amgen usually says, ""offset partially by the impact of competition"" when giving details about Enbrel sales. However, in Q3 2016, ""partially"" was conspicuously absent. Did someone just forget to copy-and-paste? Maybe. Maybe not.AMGN stock holders should pay attention to see if Enbrel will resume growth through increased volume, as opposed to price hike.Enbrel faces three major growth barriers.First, it competes againstAbbVie Inc's(NYSE:ABBV) Humira and Johnson & Johnson's Remicade. This leads to the second challenge.Stiff competition necessitates incremental rebates to payers to maintain its formulary position.The third challenge is the biosimilar availability. For instance, the FDA has approved Erelzi, an Enbrel biosimilar byNovartis AG (ADR)(NYSE:NVS).Put simply, further lackluster Enbrel growth would weigh on AMGN stock.#2: Amgen's Drug PricingInvestors also should look closely at how fast Amgen is hiking prices.I raised concerns about Amgen stockgrowing sales by increasing drug prices, instead of higher volumes, after the company reported its Q2 2015 earnings. Almost two years on, the trend of growing sales with price hikes is still commonplace at AMGN.From a business perspective, it's smart to try to squeeze out every possible dollar from your inventions. However, the U.S. government is standing up against it. President Donald Trump told drugmakers in aJan. 31 meetingthat ""we have to get the prices down.""This won't be good for the top and bottom lines of any drugmaker. However, for a company who thrives on hiking drug prices like AMGN, the downside gets bigger.#3: How Did Repatha Perform?Repatha is heralded as potentially one of Amgen's best sellers. The company said the drug caters to ""serious diseases with significant unmet needs."" However, it brought in a meager $40 million in Q3.One barrier to market growth is that payers have employed utilization-management procedures, which limited patients' ability to gain access to Repatha. Execs said during Q3 earnings call that they're working with payers and providers to allow unlabeled patient access. Investors should look to see if collaborations with payers and providers are yielding significant Repatha growth.Alphabet Inc (GOOGL): The Cheapest $800 Stock I KnowThe drug, which currently competes withSanofiSA (ADR)(NYSE:SNY) andRegeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc's(NASDAQ:REGN) Praluent, had a 55% share of new-to-brand prescriptions (NBRx) in Q4, according to an Amgen presentation at this year's JPMorgan Healthcare Conference. Still, AMGN stock holders probably want to know just how much in sales that amounted to.But it has to be noted that an ongoing court case that Amgen filed against Sanofi and Regeneron onpatent infringementgrounds is tipping the scale in Rapatha's favor for now.Finally, investors should pay attention to see if low expenses is continuing and will continue at Amgen. Since the beginning of 2015, AMGN has reduced its total expenses by roughly 3.7% to 13.22%. Keeping expenses low will be critical to future profitability, especially in Trump's recent focus on drugmakers.Earnings apart, I believe the uncertainties surrounding the future make AMGN stock less attractive.As of this writing, Craig Adeyanju did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceApple Inc.

Alphabet Inc (GOOGL): The Cheapest $800 Stock I Know;2/1/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsDisruption is everywhere.Amazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) disrupts how we shop, whileAirbnbdisrupts where we stay.Tesla Motors Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) disrupts what we drive, andUbereven disruptswhetherwe drive. If a teen with 2 million Instagram followers can disrupt how billion-dollar businesses find customers, the rest of us need to dive in and start swimming … or at least buy the one stock which has its hands in all of the above:Alphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL).makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockSimply put, GOOGL stock is the most innovative, most disruptive and cheapest $800 equity I know.Let me explain.Silicon Valley money manager Michael Moe and his team at GSV Asset Management produce a provocative weekly newsletter dedicated to highlighting where they think the world is going. While doing research for myBullseye Brief, one of their recent pieces got me thinking about innovation in more tangible terms. The team ranked eight global technology companies based on their involvement across 22 cutting-edge categories. Hands down, Alphabet ranks No. 1, capturing 21 of 22.Innovation LeadersCuriously, all eight GSV-highlighted companies have dedicated efforts in the areas of artificial intelligence, big data and cloud services, making these three the Holy Grail of innovation.The first two come as no surprise, as data gathering and analysis are critical to predicting behavior, enabling companies to target consumers accordingly. Web services, which is now the fastest-growing segment for Amazon, is less obvious but nonetheless a clear indicator these innovators want to get bigger by serving as the backbone for other companies.10 Stocks to Buy That Already Make America GreatThis is key, and since Google already commands 49% of the global online advertising market according to Pivotal Research analyst Brian Wieser, I'll bet on GOOGL.MoonshotMuch of Google's innovative efforts happen at its off-site research center called Google X, aka the Moonshot Factory. It's run by a futurist named Astro Teller, and I highly recommend hisTED Talkexplaining how Google X approaches innovation:Identify a problem affecting millions of people.Find or propose a radical solution for solving that problem.Move full speed ahead if there's reason to believe technology for such a radical solution could actually be built.He says Google X people spend most of their time ""breaking things and trying to prove they're wrong"" but believes that's their secret … what makes Googlers different. By ""killing"" more projects than they approve, their success rate rises. Alphabet spent $13.8 billion last year on research and development - the second highest number of any company in the world behind Amazon, and second highest as a percentage of sales among the eight innovation leaders.R&D as % of RevenueAlphabet invests a staggering amount of money to fund R&D, both because it can and because it has to. With three times more online advertising than its next closest competitor, GOOGL is a cash cow.By the same token, it has significant overlap with all seven competitors in the most obvious categories - like robotics and AI- and each of these companies is hungry to dominate.There's no letting up in this crowd. Innovate or die.What's GOOGL Stock Worth?Ultimately, the question is value: What do we pay?I like to compare the growth we're getting (earnings) with the price we're paying (price-to-earnings, or P/E). This is called a price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG), and it's an intuitive way to compare apples to apples.Using 2017 consensus estimates tracked by Bloomberg, GOOGL stock is tucked right in the middle of the pack. Its PEG ratio is 1.08. PEGs below 1 are cheap, and PEGs approaching 2 are expensive.PEG ratios are revealing.First of all, no one should buyMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT). It's neither a growth stock nor a value play.Alibaba Group Holding Ltd(NYSE:BABA) is a tad expensive, but not excessively so, especially since many consider ittheChinese consumer trading vehicle.Amazon is attractive, so areApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) andFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB), both of which I have written up as longs and currently own.Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Has a New Hero: Services!Samsung(OTCMKTS:SSNLF), I admit is a mystery. It'ssocheap. I can only surmise its limited German and S. Korean listings deter U.S. investors, as does the $1,700 stock price. It needs to split at least 10-to-1.The TradeSell the GOOGL April $800 puts at $20 to initiate a long-biased position.If the stock pulls back and trades through the $800 strike price, I'm assigned shares and become a buyer. If Google continues making new highs, I pocket the premium. I am content either way. Google's chart indicates initial technical support around $780, and significant long-term support $700-$725.The reason I'm selling puts rather than buying the stock is because GOOGL stock has recently risen to a new all-time high. I know new highs tend to beget new highs (momentum traders buy strength), but I'm a value buyer at heart.Adam Johnson is Founder and Author ofBullseye Brief, an investment newsletter that presents thematic and actionable ideas.

You can see all of today's research reportshere >>>Buy ratedAlphabetshares have lagged the broader market as well as the Zacks Tech sector over the past year (the stock is up +6.1% over the last 12 months vs. the +16.6% gain for the S&P 500 index), with the company's weaker than expected Q4 earnings report only adding to its underperformance. A big reason for the underperformance is uncertainty about the earnings potential of its non-core ventures. These headwinds aside, the Zacks analyst points out the company's good execution to date, more or less maintaining its dominant share in a competitive, fast-growing search market. The company's focus on innovation, strategic acquisitions and Android OS should continue to generate strong cash flows. However, the promise of Google's non-search businesses continue getting pushed into future even as the company's spending keeps rising.

Chevron exited 2016 on a mixed note, swinging to a Q4 profit from a year-ago loss even as earnings fell far below estimates. Rebounding oil and gas prices, together with lower operating expenses helped the company report a quarterly profit. However, Chevron's refining business saw its income plunge on weak margins and maintenance costs. Importantly, despite being free-cash-flow negative, the deficit has narrowed considerably and Chevron is hoping to be cash flow neutral this year. Anticipated production growth from its extensive footprint in the Permian Basin is another positive.

Citigroup's fourth-quarter earnings exceeded expectations. Recently, Citigroup inked two deals to exit servicing operations by the end of 2018, in a bid to increase focus on mortgage originations through U.S. retail footprint. The deals are expected to negatively impact first-quarter 2017 pre-tax results by about $400 million. Stringent regulatory landscape across the industry and its litigation burden are other concerns. However, the analyst likes the company's restructuring and streamlining efforts, strategic investments in core business and expense management, which should support profitability, going forward.

Analysts Forecast 11% Upside For GURU;2/1/2017;"Looking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe atETF Channel, we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the Guru Index ETF (Symbol: GURU), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $27.51 per unit.With GURU trading at a recent price near $24.88 per unit, that means that analysts see 10.58% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings.

Can Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Jump Over These Hurdles?;2/1/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAhead of earnings forFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB), which will come out at the end of trading on Wednesday, investors are certainly upbeat. And why not? FB stock has been a pretty good bet.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockBut could things be different this time around? Maybe the enthusiasm for Facebook stock is too carried away?Well, it is important to note that the valuation is still reasonable. The forward price-to-earnings ratio on FB stock is at about 25X. This compares to roughly 20X for bothAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) andMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT). And these companies are not growing at anywhere near the pace of Facebook.What's more, it seems like Facebook earnings should do fine in Q4. Revenues are expected to jump by 46% to $8.5 billion and adjusted EPS are forecasted to come to $1.31, up from 79 cents during the same period a year ago. Keep in mind that - for the past five quarters - the company has beat the Street on both the top and bottom lines.FB Stock Still Faces Several RisksBut the real potential issue for Facebook stock is any disappointing commentary on the future growth trends. Interestingly enough, on the Q3 earnings call, the company's CFO had this ominous thing tosay: ""We continue to expect that revenue growth rates will decline in Q4 as we lap a strong fourth quarter in 2015. We also continue to expect that our total payments and other fees revenue in Q4 will be lower than it was in the fourth quarter of last year.""10 Stocks to Buy That Already Make America GreatNo doubt, this should not be a surprise. As FB gets much larger, it will increasingly get more difficult to churn out strong revenue numbers. It's the curse of the so-called ""law of large numbers.""Let's face it, Facebook already has a massive user base. In the most recent quarter, the number of monthly active users hit 1.79 billion, up 16% on a year-over-year basis. There were also a stunning 1.2 billion daily users.But going forward, what will the sources of new users be? It's hard to tell. But initiatives from FB show concerns. After all, the company has been working hard to provide internet access to developing nations.And don't forget about China. According to a report from theWall Street Journal, it appears that Facebook has made little progress. Instead, rivals likeWeibo Corp(ADR)(NASDAQ:WB) andTencent(OTCMKTS:TCEHY) have been capitalizing on the opportunity.At the same time, other problems could affect FB stock. For example, during the last few months, there have been various embarrassing stories about how the company has inflated certain metrics. Might this cause some pushback from advertisers?The Snapchat IPO: The Next Facebook Inc (FB) ... Or Twitter Inc (TWTR)?Then there is the ""fake news"" controversy. Granted, the company has taken actions to improve the publishing of news, such as with a focus on credible sources. But this could result in lower clicks and views, which would slow down the revenue momentum for Facebook stock.Something else that could dampen some of the enthusiasm for FB stock: the upcoming Snapchat IPO, which should hit the markets within the next couple of months. Of course, there will be tremendous buzz and excitement. There will also be the inevitable comparisons to FB. In other words, investors may look at Snapchat as an alternative to Facebook stock when seeking the next growth play.Overall, Wednesday's earnings announcement will definitely be important. And if there are signs of deceleration on the top-line, FB stock could be vulnerable, especially since it has already pulled off a nice run for the year.Tom Taulli runs the InvestorPlace blogIPO Playbookand is a registered investment adviser representative (you canvisit his siteto learn more about his financial planning services).He is also the author of various books on investing like All About Commodities, All About Short Selling and High-Profit IPO Strategies.Follow him on Twitter at@ttaulli.

Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD): The Turnaround Is Legit!;1/31/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTurnarounds usually aren't neat, orderly affairs, butAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMD) just keeps building momentum as the semidconductor firm continues to remake itself. Fourth-quarter earnings out Tuesday evening launched AMD stock by another 5% in after-hours trading, continuing a roughly yearlong run that hasn't seen much in the way of pullbacks.makeArticleAd();Source:Matthew Rutledge via FlickrFor Q4, AMD posted an adjusted loss of 1 cent a share on revenues of $1.11 billion, which were up 15.4% year-over-year. While earnings were in line with Wall Street expectations, sales beat by about $40 million.Also driving AMD stock higher was upbeat earnings guidance for the current quarter. Advanced Micro Devices forecasts revenues to range from $955 million to $1.02 billion. Using the midpoint, AMD would be looking at an 18% increase to$989 million- well above analyst expectations for $964 million.The Top 10 Dow Dividend Stocks for FebruarySome additional highlights from AMD's fourth quarter:The Computing and Graphics unit saw its revenues jump by 28% to $600 million.The cash balance increased by $6 million, for a total of $1.26 billion.The company announced the brand of its new chips, called Ryzen.

The Lines Between Auto And Tech Are Getting Fuzzier;1/31/2017;"As we get closer and closer to a self-driving car future, the   lines between the auto industry and tech are getting blurry.In this clip fromIndustry Focus: Industrials, host Sean O'Reilly is joined by senior auto specialist John   Rosevear to talk about some of the most exciting tech news shared   byAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL)  andFord(NYSE: F)  at this year's North American International Auto   Show.A full transcript follows the video.makeArticleAd();10 stocks we like better than AlphabetWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even     better buys.Click hereto learn about these picks!*Stock Advisor returns as of January 4, 2017This podcast was recorded on Jan. 19, 2017.Sean O'Reilly:You mentioned how increasingly there's tech analysts there. It   might be just a happy coincidence that it was right after CES   [the Consumer Electronics Show]. Did it feel like a tech show   when you were there?John Rosevear:It has become really interesting. I didn't go to CES this year;   we had other folks from The Fool who were out there. But CES --   the Consumer Electronics Show, which is in Vegas -- is also held   usually the first week of January every year, has had more and   more of an automotive focus. Ford CEO Mark Fields was out there.MobileyeandDelphiwere demonstrating their new self-driving stuff out there.Fiat Chryslershowed off an electric concept minivan at CES. It's more and more   focused on autos, future-tech autos.Then the press days run up until Wednesday or Thursday of that   week, and then everything starts in Detroit the following Sunday.   It's just a couple days later; people fly straight in. This year,   it was very notable -- it was almost as if that conversation was   continuing on a separate track from the traditional show itself,   where they're unveiling the latest minivan and all that kind of   stuff.We had John Krafcik, who heads up Waymo. Waymo is the company   under the Alphabet umbrella formerly known as the Google   Self-Driving Car Project. John Krafcik was in Detroit; he gave a   presentation on Sunday afternoon talking about the state of   Waymo's technology and what they're doing to test it and so   forth. He was clearly there talking to the auto industry, talking   to the automakers.Waymo seems to be in ""let's make a deal"" mode right now. They   showed off the test car they created with Fiat Chrysler, a   Waymo-ized version of the Chrysler Pacifica minivan, which is   already kind of futuristic and sexy-looking. It's kind of   cool-looking; their self-driving sensors and stuff are much more   smoothly integrated. You can still tell it's a test car, it still   has this big thing on the roof. But it looks more like something   you might see produced in the near future. They were running   around withToyotaand Lexus and Audi test vehicles with stuff tacked on for   years.But anyway, to get back to the point, there was a steady   discussion. Ford had a whole separate thing going on adjacent to   the show where they had speakers on future mobility. Ford is   trying to get into the business of helping cities come up with   mobility plans as electric cars, self-driving, ride-sharing, and   so forth become more prevalent and more affordable as technology   advances. And this is a whole separate discussion that's going on   throughout the show, aside from the traditional show itself,   where automakers are showing off their new vehicles to the global   media. It was really interesting, the way this is going. And   there were several points in the show where I wished there had   been two of me, because there were two things going on at the   same time that I really wanted to attend.Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The     Motley Fool's board of directors.John Rosevearowns shares of Ford.Sean O'Reillyhas no position in any stocks mentioned.

Is Voice Search an Opportunity or a Threat to Google?;1/31/2017;"Image source: Google.Consumers are doing more and more web searches just by   talking. And they're not just asking the digital assistants on   their smartphones; they're also buying all-new devices, such as   theAmazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) Echo and Google Home, to answer random   queries.makeArticleAd();For Google, the subsidiary ofAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) , the new trend in search is a   double-edged sword. On one hand, it provides another point for   users to interact with its product. On the other, Google doesn't   have a stranglehold on the device market, and it isn't clear how   companies can monetize voice search with ads.Even as Google navigated the shift to mobile, it still   fundamentally followed the same business model -- display ads   within search results. That's not possible with voice   searches.But Google CEO Sundar Pichai isn't concerned. ""I see more   opportunity than challenge, when I think about voice search,"" he   told analysts on the company's fourth-quarter earnings call. I   wouldn't be so sure he doesn't have that backward.Losing the hardware battleGoogle didn't provide any exact figures on the sales of its   new Google Home device. Pichai did say that ""Google Home was a   very popular present that many people opened on Christmas   morning,"" but that was as detailed as he got.RBC analyst Mark Mahaney suggests that Google is getting   outsold 10-to-1 by competitors such as Amazon Echo. That presents   a real challenge for Google, because without control over the   hardware, it has no control over the user interface. That means   all those potential voice searches will go to someone else.Pichai points out that it's the very early days for devices   such as Google Home. And Google does have one big advantage over   Amazon and other competitors -- it's much better at search. ""When   I look at what it would take to voice search well, our years of   progress we have done in areas like natural language processing   comes into play,"" Pichai said on the call. To his credit,   Google Home has outperformed Alexain manyhead-to-head searchreviews.But smart-speaker hardware is about more than search, and   Amazon's Echo is capable of integrating with more devices and   services than Google Home is. Google is certainly capable of   overcoming that through more strategic partnerships, though. It   just released a development kit for businesses to integrate with   Google Home last month.One area that will be harder to overcome is how well Amazon   Echo works for Amazon Prime members. With tens of millions of   Prime members around the world, it creates a pretty big moat for   Google Home to cross.But wait -- it gets tougherEven if Google closes the gap in hardware sales, it still has   to find a way to turn voice search into a business. Hardware   sales won't move the needle for Alphabet, which generated over   $90 billion in revenue last year.What's more, Google has to sell the hardware near cost because   its biggest competitor, Amazon, does the same. The margins on a   Google Home device don't even come close to Google's 31%   operating margin in the fourth quarter.If Google is going to make some real money off of voice   search, it needs to go beyond just getting its devices into   people's homes. Google's best idea so far is tofacilitate commerce through voice search. But if there's one company that has Google's number in   e-commerce search, it's Amazon. Google will not win a battle   against Amazon in developing a personal shopping assistant, no   matter how good its search capabilities are.Not just a challenge -- a threatThe growth of voice isn't just a challenge for Google. The   shift to voice represents a threat, as it could result in a   decline in the amount consumers use Google search, the company's   cash cow.Google is working to overcome the head start Amazon got in   smart speakers, which accelerated the voice search trend. It   plans to expand its hardware lineup and invest more in 2017. But   as voice search continues growing and starts taking searches away   from mobile and desktop, it will put pressure on Google to   continue developing new higher-value display and search ads for   its main desktop and mobile products.10 stocks we like better than Alphabet (A   shares)When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Top Analyst Reports for Alphabet, Citigroup, Chevron & Others;1/31/2017;"makeZacksArticleAd();Tuesday, January 31 2017Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Alphabet (GOOGL), Chevron (CVX) and Citigroup (C). You can see all of today's research reportshere >>>Buy ratedAlphabetshares have lagged the broader market as well as the Zacks Tech sector over the past year (the stock is up +6.1% over the last 12 months vs. the +16.6% gain for the S&P 500 index), with the company's weaker than expected Q4 earnings report only adding to its underperformance. A big reason for the underperformance is uncertainty about the earnings potential of its non-core ventures. These headwinds aside, the Zacks analyst points out the company's good execution to date, more or less maintaining its dominant share in a competitive, fast-growing search market. The company's focus on innovation, strategic acquisitions and Android OS should continue to generate strong cash flows. However, the promise of Google's non-search businesses continue getting pushed into future even as the company's spending keeps rising. (You canread the full research report on Alphabet here >>)Chevronshares have gained +31% over the last one year, outperforming the Zacks Oil & Gas-International Integrated industry which has gained +23.2% over the same time period, as well as rival Exxon Mobil. Chevron exited 2016 on a mixed note, swinging to a Q4 profit from a year-ago loss even as earnings fell far below estimates. Rebounding oil and gas prices, together with lower operating expenses helped the company report a quarterly profit. However, Chevron's refining business saw its income plunge on weak margins and maintenance costs. Importantly, despite being free-cash-flow negative, the deficit has narrowed considerably and Chevron is hoping to be cash flow neutral this year. Anticipated production growth from its extensive footprint in the Permian Basin is another positive. (You canread the full research report on Chevron here >>)Citigroupshares have modestly underperformed the Zacks Major Banks industry over the last one year, gaining +33.3% vs +38.3%. Citigroup's fourth-quarter earnings exceeded expectations. Recently, Citigroup inked two deals to exit servicing operations by the end of 2018, in a bid to increase focus on mortgage originations through U.S. retail footprint. The deals are expected to negatively impact first-quarter 2017 pre-tax results by about $400 million. Stringent regulatory landscape across the industry and its litigation burden are other concerns. However, the analyst likes the company's restructuring and streamlining efforts, strategic investments in core business and expense management, which should support profitability, going forward.

Is Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Resurrecting the Cursed Windows RT?;1/31/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsDon't look now, butMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) looks to be taking another run atAlphabet Inc's(NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) Chrome operating system. References have begun popping up in builds of the Windows 10 Creators Update (which is due to arrive in April) to Windows 10 Cloud.makeArticleAd();Source: MicrosoftSpeculation is growing that Windows 10 Cloud is in fact a new simplified version of Microsoft's operating system, designed to run on devices powered by inexpensive ARM chips fromARM Holdings plc (ADR)(NASDAQ:ARMH).In other words, it appears that Microsoft is preparing to take on the threat of Chromebooks - the cheap, popular laptops running Google's Chrome OS. And it seems to be doing so by resurrecting the idea of Windows RT.Windows 10 CloudWindows 10 Creators Build is the next major revision of the Microsoft Windows PC operating system. It's due to begin rolling out to users around April 17.The 5 Best Stocks to Buy for Big Emerging Markets ProfitsBut developers have been testing pre-release builds of Microsoft's software and recently some of them began to notice something strange: The code references different variations of the operating system. For example, Windows 10 Pro for Workstation and Windows 10 for Enterprise are spiked out. Nothing unusual there. But then, references to Windows 10 Cloud began to appear. And that started raising eyebrows - what is Windows 10 Cloud?ZDNet'sMary Jo Foley put the pieces together yesterday. Quoting unnamed sources, she says that the mysterious Windows 10 Cloud is a new, simplified version of Microsoft Windows that will run only Unified Windows Platform (UWP) apps. In other words, it's a""simpler, safer, cheaper"" version of Windows 10.You might also think of it as another crack at Windows RT …Windows RT? But Why?Everyone remembers the mess that wasWindows RT. The attempt to shoehorn a version of Windows onto a consumer tablet running ARM chips -the ill-fated Surface RT - very nearly dealt MSFT's tablet aspirations a fatal blow.However, despite the failure of Windows RT, Microsoft has never given up on the idea of Windows on ARM chips. By doing so, it can get Windows onto mobile devices that can't use the more powerful and expensive chips fromIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC). The company has already been showing offWindows 10 running in emulation on high-end ARM chips. As part of that effort, it could also be working on a ""lite"" version that can deliver much of the Windows 10 experience on less expensive, lower powered ARM hardware.So why, why,whywould Microsoft risk falling flat on its face again with what essentially amounts to another crack at Windows RT? There are two reasons.The first is that dream of ""Windows everywhere."" Having the full Windows 10 experience on high-powered ARM chips is great, but only flagship smartphones and tablets can afford to use those chips. Windows 10 Cloud would get Microsoft Windows (and Bing) onto a whole lot more mobile hardware.The second is Google's Chrome OS and Chromebooks. These cheap laptops have been under Microsoft's skin for years. They've become extremely popular in the education sector thanks to low cost, ease of use and built-in security. And Chromebooks have just kept selling, to the point where last year they passed evenApple Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AAPL)MacBooks in sales.Microsoft has tried fighting back by helping manufacturers put out cheap Windows 10 laptops, but that hasn't stemmed the Chromebook flood. Windows 10 makes for a sluggish experience on inexpensive Intel hardware, it's far more complex than Chrome OS to use and lacks the drop-dead easy security of Chromebooks.Cash Out of Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Before EarningsWindows 10 Cloud running on laptops with ARM processors would compete head-to-head with Chromebooks running Chrome OS: simpler, safer and cheaper than Windows 10.Microsoft refused to comment on theZDNetpost, but the pieces pointing to Windows 10 as a Chrome OS-fighting, second crack at Windows RT make sense.

Buy the Dip in Alphabet Inc (GOOGL, GOOG) Stock;1/31/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) took its turn in the earnings limelight last week, and investors were not happy with the results.Offering up a rare miss, Alphabet said it earned $9.36 per share versus expectations of $9.63 per share, while revenue arrived at $26.06 billion compared to predictions for $25.22 billion.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockGOOGL stock has since fallen more than 5%, and its edging lower once again today.But the shares were due for a bit of a selloff, as GOOGL stock was overbought heading into earnings amid an overly enthusiastic sentiment backdrop. Contrarian investors know that this is a recipe for short-term disaster on even the slightest hiccup.Click to EnlargeNow that the knee-jerk selling has about run its course, it's time to get back to being realistic on GOOGL stock's prospects. Technically, Alphabet shares remain in a long-term uptrend, supported by its 10-week and 20-week moving averages.Furthermore, these trendlines completed a bullish cross earlier this month, which could bring bargain hunters to the table once the post-earnings gyrations have subsided.The 5 Best Stocks to Buy for Big Emerging Markets ProfitsAs for sentiment, the fourth-quarter earnings blip for GOOGL stock hasn't shaken the brokerage community one bit. And it shouldn't. According to Thomson/First Call, all but two of the 48 analysts following Alphabet Inc rate the shares a ""buy"" or better. Additionally, the 12-month price target of $988.47 represents a modest premium of only about 19% to GOOGL's Monday close.With search ad revenue holding strong and Alphabet expanding its hardware program, we may even see a few upward revisions in the next month or so.On the options front, GOOGL Feb./March put/call open interest ratio has risen slightly in the past week to rest at 0.72, with puts gaining a bit of traction in the wake of last week's quarterly report. For the March series, traders are still eyeing the $860 and $900 strikes, while put traders are focused on $800 and $750.Overall, March implieds are pricing in a potential move of about 5% in the next two months. Currently, this places the upper bound at $865.02, while the lower bound lies at $782.64 from Monday's close. I would be surprised to see GOOGL stock trade south of $800, as it would take some unexpectedly poor news from Alphabet or a significant turn in the overall market. A rally to $860 seems more likely, though resistance at $850 could be a stumbling block.2 Trades for GOOGL StockPut Sell:The safest route to profit on GOOGL stock right now would be to bank on technical support and sell option premium. Right now, the March $800 put looks like a solid bet for such a play. At last check, this put was bid at $12, or $1,200 per contract.As usual, you keep the premium as long as GOOGL stock closes above $800 when these options expire. The downside is that should Alphabet trade below $800 ahead of March expiration, you could be assigned 100 shares for each sold put at a cost of $800 per share.Sprint Corp (S) Q3 Earnings Give Bulls the Green Light: Keep Buying!Call Spread:If you are more bullish on GOOGL stock's prospects, then a March $830/$850 bull call spread has potential At last check, this spread was offered at $8, or $800 per pair of contracts.Breakeven lies at $838.00, while a maximum profit of $12, or $1,200 per pair of contracts, is possible if Alphabet closes at or above $850 when March options expire.As of this writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 Stocks to Buy That Already Make America Great7 Stocks to Buy That Could Double by 2018The postBuy the Dip in Alphabet Inc (GOOGL, GOOG) Stockappeared first onInvestorPlace."

5 Reasons I Don't Buy MeetMe's Growth Story;1/31/2017;"Last December, I highlightedMeetMe(NASDAQ: MEET) as apotentially undervaluedgrowth play in a frothy market. The social networking app maker   posted eye-popping numbers last quarter -- 32% annual growth in   monthly active users (MAUs), 20% growth in total revenues, and   30% non-GAAP earnings growth.Analysts expect MeetMe's revenue and non-GAAP earnings to   respectively rise 38% and 16% next year. Yet the stock trades at   just 7 times trailing earnings and 10 times forward earnings.   Let's take a look at the five key reasons investors aren't buying   MeetMe's growth story, despite its high growth figures and low   valuations.MeetMe's mobile app. Image source: Google Play.makeArticleAd();1. A troubling history with sexual predatorsMeetMe lets users find new people in their area to chat with,   similar toMatch's(NASDAQ: MTCH) Tinder. While there's nothing inherently   sinister about the app, there have been multiple reports of   MeetMe being used by sexual predators.In 2014, the City of San Francisco sued MeetMe for the   unlawful publication of minors' profiles, photos, and geolocation   data, and claimed that  the app ""enabled"" sexual predators   to find their victims. The city cited several cases involving   adult men and minors in which MeetMe was used. MeetMe settled the   case for $200,000 the  following year, agreeing to clarify   and simplify its user agreements and settings, and reducing the   amount of data displayed on minors to their city and state.But the cases involving MeetMe didn't cease -- last February,   a Buffalo man was  charged with multiple counts of child   pornography after using MeetMe to find minors. MeetMe's troubles   raised red flags at Tinder, which hiked its age limit from 13 to   18 last June. Yet MeetMe still hasn't followed suit, presumably   because it would lose a large portion of its users.2. The potential loss of ad revenuesYou'd think that big companies would be reluctant to advertise   on MeetMe, but plenty of big brands still advertise on the app.   That's because MeetMe generates most of its ad revenues from   programmatic ads delivered byTwitter's(NYSE:TWTR) MoPub.This means that MoPub's customers simply pick a demographic --   in MeetMe's case, younger users and Millennials -- and the   platform feeds the ads to various apps. This means that many   companies probably don't realize that their ads are appearing on   MeetMe.Therefore, a common bear thesis is that MoPub could decide to   drop MeetMe due to violations of its terms of service, or   advertisers could ask MoPub to pull their ads from the   controversial app. There's no evidence either of these scenarios   will occur, but it raises a troubling question -- if MeetMe's   reputation worsens, can it still keep growing its ad   revenues?3. Being booted from the app storesIn its 10-K filing for fiscal 2015, MeetMe admits  that   its business will suffer if it is ""unable to maintain a good   relationship"" withAppleandAlphabet's Google. It notes that its app could be pulled from their app   stores ""if we violate"" or the companies believe ""that we have   violated"" their terms and conditions.The bulls might believe that's just a typical ""risk factor""   warning, but MeetMe admits in the same filing that ""on more than   one occasion,"" Apple rejected its app ""because of user generated   content and other concerns."" This indicates that another   high-profile lawsuit could knock MeetMe out of the app stores and   kill its business.4. Tinder is crushing MeetMeMeetMe arrived before Tinder, which was initially launched in   2012. But over the past five years, mainstream interest in MeetMe   waned in correlation with Tinder's growth, as seen in this chart   from Google Trends:Image source: Google.That decline also explains why MeetMe acquired its competitor   Skout last  October. That move boosted the company's MAU   count from about 5 million to  8.5 million, and greatly   inflated MeetMe's top and bottom line growth for fiscal 2016.5. The lack of insider confidenceIf MeetMe is as undervalued as the fundamentals suggest, you'd   expect insiders to be loading up on shares. However, MeetMe CEO   Geoffrey Cook just  sold 250,000 shares (16% of his entire   position) at an average price of $5.02.Including Cook's sales, insiders sold  1.96 million   shares over the past 12 months, but only bought 334,000 shares.   It's understandable that MeetMe's insiders would sell after the   stock's 50% rally over the past 12 months, but it also indicates   that its upside potential could be limited.The key takeawayThe main lesson here is to always look beyond the valuations   and growth forecasts. On the surface, MeetMe looks like a rapidly   growing social app maker trading at a discount to its peers. But   dig deeper, and you'll see an app that's struggling to prove that   it's not a tool for criminals while remaining relevant against   Tinder, which dominates the space with  over 50 million   active users.10 stocks we like better than MeetMeWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

4 Reasons I'm Buying Baidu Inc. (ADR) Stock;1/31/2017;"Chinese search giantBaidu(NASDAQ: BIDU) is often dismissed as a slow-growth tech stock   that has run out of room to grow. Its heavy investments in   expanding its ecosystem into adjacent markets have weighed down   its bottom line growth, making the stock seem like dead money.   Despite those challenges, however, I recently started a new   position in Baidu for four main reasons.Baidu Image Search. Image source: Author's screenshot.makeArticleAd();1. It's still the 800-pound gorillaBaidu controls roughly 80% of the internet search market in   China. That dominant position enables it to expand its ecosystem   in the same way asAlphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google. Its sprawling ecosystem   now includes Baidu Maps, video streaming site iQiyi, its Duer   voice assistant, the Baidu Wallet payment platform, numerous   portal sites, and various O2O (online-to-offline) services in its   ""monolithic"" mobile app.While the profitability of these services varies greatly, they   all help Baidu gather data from its users for targeted ads. Last   quarter, Baidu's revenue per online marketing customer rose 10.6%   annually. This indicates that Baidu still remains a top   advertising pick in China, even as other popular apps -- likeTencent's WeChat -- tether more users to their ecosystems. Moreover,   China still has an internet penetration rate of just 52%, which   means that there may be plenty of room for all these companies to   expand without stepping on each other's toes.2. Its slowdown is temporaryBaidu fell out of favor with growth investors as its top and   bottom line growth seemingly dried up. Last quarter, its revenue   fell  0.7% annually, its core online marketing revenue slid   6.7%, and its non-GAAP net income rose just 6.3%. Analysts expect   its  revenue to rise 6% this year, but for its earnings to   decline 9%.However, that slowdown was mainly caused by three temporary   headwinds. First, Chinese regulators forced Baidu to remove   misleading pharmaceutical ads following the death of a student   who bought unapproved cancer drugs advertised on the site.   Second, Baidu sold its stake in online travel agencyQunarto its rivalCtrip(NASDAQ: CTRP) , essentially swapping its stake in Qunar for one   in Ctrip but temporarily throttling revenue growth.Lastly, Baidu's heavy investments in R&D are squeezing its   margins, but launching new services could boost its long-term   growth and widen its moat against rivals like Tencent. That's why   analysts believe that Baidu's revenue and earnings will   respectively rebound 21% and 33% in fiscal 2017.3. Growth potential in next-gen marketsLike Google, Baidu is investing heavily in artificial   intelligence, driverless cars, and other ""next-gen"" technologies.   Machine learning and AI have become increasingly important to   search and advertising companies, since they help gather more   data from users to create targeted ads that users are more likely   to click on. Baidu has been hiring a lot of top talent in that   field -- its chief scientist, Andrew Ng, previously led the   Google Brain AI project, and its  new augmented reality   chief Qi Lu was aMicrosoftexec specializing in AI.To showcase its AI efforts, Baidu pitted its AI robot against   Google's AlphaGo AI in a battle of facial and voice recognition   in early January. It partnered withNVIDIAand HERE Maps to develop mapping systems for autonomous vehicles,   and plans to launch a driverless shuttle bus in China in 2018. It   also partnered with  smart remote maker Peel to establish a   foothold in the growing smart home market. These projects   won't generate meaningful revenue for years, but they could   greatly expand Baidu's O2O ecosystem over the long term.4. The stock is still cheapBaidu currently trades at just 13 times earnings, which is   much lower than Google's P/E of 31 and the industry average of 50   for internet information providers. But due to its projected   decline in earnings this year, the stock has a forward P/E of 30.   While that forward multiple doesn't seem cheap, we should   remember that Baidu's earnings are expected to rebound in   2017.The key takeawayBaidu will likely remain weighed down by near-term challenges   over the next few quarters, but it's still well-positioned to   profit from the long-term growth of the Chinese internet market.   Baidu may struggle to pull social users away from Tencent and   shoppers away fromAlibaba, but its dominance of the search-based ad market won't end   anytime soon.10 stocks we like better than Alphabet (A     shares)When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Alphabet Employees Protest Against Trump's Immigration Ban;1/31/2017;"Protests against Donald Trump's anti-immigration policy are gaining steam and the technology sector appears to be leading the way.  More than 2000Alphabet Inc.'sGOOGLGoogle employees staged protests against Trump's immigration ban by walking out of eight offices worldwide including the company's headquarters in Mountain View on Monday. Photos and videos of the walkouts have been tweeted using hashtag #GooglersUnite.Google co-founder Sergey Brin and CEO Sundar Pichai have extended their full support to the opposition.Concurrent with the protest, Google created a $4 million fund to support immigrant rights groups like the Immigrant Legal Resource Center, the American Civil Liberties Union, the U.N. Refugee Agency and the International Rescue Committee.The protest was particularly against Trump's executive order to ban nationals of seven Muslim majority countries - Iraq, Iran, Somalia, Libya, Syria, Sudan and Yemen - from coming to the U.S. Pichai denounced the order and stated that the ban affects about 187 Google employees.We note that not quite long ago, Trump had called up technology leaders and urged them to create and retain jobs within the U.S. to which most of them had given their nods. However as the immigration ban order rolled out, the sector is sending clear indications that it will not create jobs at the cost of preventing entry to external talent.Alphabet Inc.

Will Twitter's Steps to Curb Hate Speech Revive User Growth?;1/31/2017;"Twitter Inc. (TWTR)will introduce measures to check trolling on its platform within this week. Ed Ho, the vice president of engineering, in a series of tweets, said that in the coming days, Twitter will start ""rolling out a number of product changes"" and ""tackle long overdue fixes to mute/block and stopping repeat offenders from creating new accounts."" He also added that management is working on making Twitter a ""safer platform"" with utmost ""urgency."" He refrained from giving a detailed explanation on the type of ""product changes"" that the company is mulling on.Twitter, Inc. Price and ConsensusTwitter, Inc. Price and Consensus|Twitter, Inc. QuoteTwitter has been trying to contain the trolling menace that has plagued its platform for long now and has possibly kept potential users as well as buyers at bay. Women, minorities as well the LGBT community often have been the target of ridicule on the platform.Reportedly, in January this year, a number of LGBT groups launched a campaign to urge Twitter to deal with the ""homophobic"" abuses posted on the social media site. Last year, Twitter found itself in trouble after African American actress, Leslie Jones was brutally trolled on the platform, prompting her to quit for some time. However, Twitter took swift action after Jones' complaint and banned several users for lifetime including Breitbart technology editor Milo Yiannopoulos. Also, Twitter took down accounts of several so called ""alt-right"" to curb hateful conduct on its platform.Apart from taking down accounts of offenders, Twitter also announced several measures to combat trolling. Twitter improvised the ""mute"" button, which will enable users to block tweets that contain objectionable words, phrases and conversations from their notification tabs. Plus, the company empowered users by giving them a ""more direct way of reporting"" hateful conduct. Any Twitter user can now report any hateful conduct that they come across on the platform. Per Twitter, this ""helps reduce the burden on the person experiencing the abuse, and helps to strengthen a culture of collective support on Twitter."" The company said that it is also ""retraining"" its staff to better tackle abusive behavior on the platform.Twitter is going through one of the toughest phases in its corporate history. User growth is sluggish and advertising revenues are decelerating. Amid this entire fracas, the exodus of high profile executives continues. In the past one year, shares of Twitter declined 5.70% as against 9.91% rise in the ZacksInternet Softwareindustry. Its CEO Jack Dorsey's focus on ""live"" and user friendly changes hasn't yet moved the needle for Twitter.To top it, the widely expected takeover didn't materialize with the interested parties ranging from AlphabetGOOGLto Salesforce to The Walt Disney CompanyDISpulling out last minute, given the plethora of challenges that Twitter faces besides trolling.Will Twitter's new fixes help revive user growth?
