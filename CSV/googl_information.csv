Buy Some Downside to Own Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock at a Discount;3/24/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsInvestors have been hammered inAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) in more ways than one this week. But is it time to buy GOOGL stock's pullback? Let's take a look at what's behind the price action, the technical picture and a limited-risk options strategy on Alphabet to better navigate the environment.makeArticleAd();Source:Travis Wise via FlickrThe consensus view earlier this year had been anypolitical risksfacing Alphabet would surely be coming out of China or from Capitol Hill. But it was a problem from across the pond and from our European neighbors in the U.K. that sent shares of GOOGL tumbling this week.For the weekly period, shares of Alphabet are off about 4% after influential foreign ad buyers lashed out about how their ads had been placed alongside terrorist and other extremism media on Google's YouTube. For its part, Alphabet is taking action and looking to improve its""brand safety controls.""Improvements aren't happening soon enough for some though. Earlier this week, asBarron's noted,France'sHavas SA, the world's sixth largest marketing agency, stated it had pulled the plug on all client advertising in the U.K. from both YouTube and the Google Display Network.And now American companies are joining the ranks in protest as well.10 Clobbered Stocks to Buy That Are About to Get Red-HotIn the interim and while the controversy plays out withbullslike Pacific Crest and bears, or at leastalarmists, chiming in, we can take a visual look at how things are playing out in GOOGL stock.GOOGL Stock Daily ChartJust prior to this week's sudden and volatile bout of profit-taking, GOOGL stock had been making all the right technical moves. Since the beginning of 2017, shares of Alphabet managed to successfully clear the prior all-time highs, rally, establish a successful test of support and then proceed to even higher highs.Now - despite the quick drop of around 4% this week - our view is Alphabet could be setting up as a pullback entry. For the more quick-fingered among us, the hammering of shares by Thursday's close actually formed a bullish hammer low.The reversal pattern has some backing from an oversold stochastics condition and received price confirmation early Friday as GOOGL stock moved above the candlestick's high of $841.69.Is it perfect? No. There has been some distribution, the current setup is modestly below the well-watched 50-day simple moving average and trends do eventually end.Personally and given the mixed evidence, I'd rather look at entering into GOOGL stock if it were to trade down into a support zone from around $795 - $825. The potential area of support holds a couple retracement levels, the 200-day simple moving average and a second test of the prior highs, and amounts to a correction of up to 9% within the bigger picture's established uptrend.GOOGL Long Put ButterflyGiven my belief that the hammering may not be completely done in Alphabet, I like the idea of an atypical approach to positioning for downside and buying stock at lower levels.With GOOGL near $840, the April $835/$820/$805 is priced for $2.20 or better. The bearishly targeted butterfly achieves its maximum profit of $12.80 if shares fall 2.5% to $820 on expiration. More achievable, the limited risk spread maintains a profit range from $807.20 to $832.80 and prior to that third Friday, gains can even be realized outside the targeted price zone.Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock Has a Powerful New WeaponIf GOOGL stock actually begins to rally in a material way, I would personally look to cut risk using a money stop of 50%, or $1.10. While the initial debit is small, holding on and remaining on the wrong side of price action in a name the trader ultimately wants to own at lower prices doesn't make sense.Were shares of Alphabet to fall below $805, the trader will be out the full debit. However, if the end game is buying GOOGL on weakness as it enters the support zone, knowing the most you'd pay for the stock is $807.20 and possibly a lot less, is worth considering.Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in any of the securities or their derivatives mentioned in this article.

How Much Will Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Fall If the iPhone 8 Flops?;3/24/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsCalling a spade a spade,Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) is the most recognizable names in the world. By extension, AAPL stock remains one of the market's most sought-after picks.makeArticleAd();Source:iphonedigital via FlickrBoth platitudes are well deserved. The company has earned its way to the top, making a piece of hardware - the iPhone - not only a technical marvel, but a status symbol and lifestyle centerpiece like no other. The device keeps millions of consumers ranging from tweens to geriatrics with their noses buried in their smartphones in all four corners of the earth.Nevertheless …While Apple has been largely deserving of its spot on so many investors' pedestals, that sort of collective homage is always dangerous. Nothing lasts forever, and as unpopular as the premise may be, it would be wise to at least entertain the possibility that the next-generation iPhone (referred to the iPhone 8 so far) could the unveiling that starts exposing Apple's cracks.iPhone 8 Flop? Never!Before you pull out your pitchfork, start heating up the tar and gather your feathers, dial it back just a bit. This isn't to say that even a mediocre Apple still isn't better than most any other stock on the planet.10 Safe Dividend Stocks to Own During the Next Market CrashStill, there are three key reasons the iPhone 8 could end up not beingthe panaceait has been made out to be. Yes, they're rather obvious, but concerns all the same:1. People Really Are Growing Tired of the Constant ConnectivityIt was fun for a few years, but some smartphone owners - an increasing number of them - are starting to realize their unhealthy addiction to their devices. A survey performed last year indicated that42% of Americansconstantly check their phones for new messages. It's a statistic being noticed by impartial observes like CTV technology analyst Carmi Levy.Levy commentedlast year:""The promise of technology is that it'll improve our lives, but sometimes we become enslaved to the technology because there's so much going on. A certain part of our brain is always looking for something that is perhaps simpler … and delivers as promised with fewer frustrations.""Enough consumers are starting to move the notion out of their subconscious into their conscious.2. $1,000 for a Phone? Really?Yep, somebody out there won't think twice about paying it. A lot of people won't think twice about paying it. For a wide swath of iPhone fans who will sooner or later realize that's more than one month's rent or mortgage payment, though, they're due a ""get real"" moment.3. Strong CompetitionFor the longest time, Apple had little to no competition. That's changing though. Yes,the exploding battery debacleSamsung Electronics(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) faced with its Galaxy 7 phones was damning, and it's not like the Google Pixel fromAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL)was a smashing successthat threatened Apple either.Both companies are still overhauling their hardware and improving their designs though, and consumers are taking notice, for about a third to half the cost of an iPhone.Potential Impact on AAPL StockAs for the impact a lackluster iPhone 8 response might have on AAPL stock, one can only guess. But, one can still make an educated guess.For its most recently completed quarter, Applesold 78.29 million iPhones, generating $54.38 billion worth of revenue. That's not necessarily a full picture of the then-new iPhone 7's success, however. The device was actually unveiled a few days prior to the beginning of the quarter, and saw tremendous sales immediately after its launch. For the iPhone 7's inaugural quarter, the company producediPhone revenue of $28.16 billion, selling 45.51 million units. Between both quarters, the bulk of the iPhones sold were the 7 model.It was record-breaking success, by the way, with the78.29 million iPhones sold last quarteredging out sales of the second edition of the iPhone 6 in the comparable quarter a year earlier. The average selling price for the most recent quarter comes out to $695 apiece.That price tag does present something of a quandary for any estimates regarding the impending success of the iPhone 8. It could sell 30% fewer phones, but inasmuch as the cost of the 8 is more than 40% greater than the 7, Apple could conceivably do just as well (and possibly post wider margins).This is where putting AAPL stock on a pedestal becomes a bit of a problem though.Bottom Line for AppleFor better or worse, Apple shareholders have largely been trained to expect beats not just of revenue and earnings estimates, but also beats of sales as measured by units. Any weakness on any front poses a risk to a usually frothy AAPL valuation.My prediction? I firmly believe the iPhone 8 will be an unexpected disappointment, though that's distinctly different than a flop. Some - though not all - will balk at a four-figure sticker price, forcing people to finally ask themselves ""What are we doing, paying a thousand bucks to keep in touch onFacebookand to play mobile video games on a five inch screen?""Again, don't misunderstand. I fully acknowledge there are some utilitarian features on the iPhone 8 that will be viewed as a must-have for some consumers.Wireless chargingis convenient, and the built-in touch ID is going to be critical to some business users concerned about security.By and large though, I have to believe the average consumer just wants a phone they can use to stay connected, via the web and voice. An edge-to-edge screen or a lack of a home button isn't the game-changer it's being made it to be, especially at $1,000 a pop … even for people who only own the iPhone as a status symbol.Kroger Co (KR) Stock Looks Very Attractive Right NowTo quantify my pessimism, I'm guessing Apple sells 70 million units of the iPhone 8 in its first full quarter starting in October. That translates into more year-over-year revenue, but is still a letdown for what's supposed to be ""the best iPhone ever."" Such a result could easily send AAPL sock careening, though odds are good the market would figure it out before the official numbers were released by the company. AAPL stock could lose as much as 20% of its value on that kind of worry.Perhaps worse than the numbers themselves would be the sudden realization that Apple is indeed fallible. A bad quarter is forgivable. A flawed business model isn't as easily forgotten.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace9 Cheap Stocks to Buy Now Under $9 a Share10 Clobbered Stocks to Buy That Are About to Get Red-HotThe postHow Much Will Apple Inc.

Google Aims at Workplace Diversity with Howard West Program;3/24/2017;"Alphabet Inc.'sGOOGLGoogle has partnered with Howard University to offer black software engineers a chance to learn from a new program called ""Howard West"".The first 12-week batch consisting of 25 to 30 juniors and seniors in Howard's computer science program will commence this summer with numbers expected to increase in future semesters.

Will Twitter's Proposed Subscription Model Achieve Success?;3/24/2017;"Twitter Inc.TWTRis contemplating on developing a premium version of Tweetdeck interface, for which the company will charge subscription fees. Tweetdeck helps users navigate Twitter and the premium version will probably be ad-free.makeArticleAd();But will this move be successful in reinvigorating Twitter's dwindling top-line growth?We believe that this is a tough proposition considering Twitter's meager user growth amid significant competition from FacebookFB. The complex nature of Twitter's service has been often considered as a major hindrance to user growth.With 319 million users, Twitter trails way behind Facebook, which has over 1.8 billion users. Even Facebook's subsidiary, Instagram has over 600 million users. In the trailing 12 months, Twitter's Monthly average users (MAUs) increased only 14 million as compared with Facebook's massive 269 million.This has also affected top-line growth, particularly Twitter's, which is significantly dependent on advertising revenues (roughly 90% of total revenue) as compared with Facebook. We note that the social-media giant's revenues have jumped almost 50% in last 12 months to $8.81 billion as compared with roughly 1% growth to $717 million for Twitter.Twitter, Inc. Revenue (TTM)Twitter, Inc. Revenue (TTM)|Twitter, Inc. QuoteThe sluggish user and top-line growth has impacted stock price. Twitter shares have declined 6.1% as compared with the ZacksInternet Softwareindustry's increase of 10.5%.Twitter Losing Ad revenue ShareNo doubt, Alphabet'sGOOGLGoogle division and Facebook will continue to dominate the digital ad revenue market for the next several years. However, Twitter is now anticipated to lose market share due to intensifying competition from Snapchat.As per research firm, eMarketer, Snapchat-parent Snap Inc.'sSNAPad revenues for the current year are projected to be $770 million, up 157.8% over fiscal 2016. The revenue figure is expected to hit $1.30 billion in 2018 and $2.20 billion in 2019.Meanwhile Twitter's ad-revenues are expected to decline from $1.36 billion in 2016 to $1.30 billion in 2017. The figure is expected to remain flat in 2018 and increase slightly to $1.31 billion in 2019.Twitter's mobile ad revenue market share is anticipated to decline from 2.6% in 2016 to 1.4% in 2019. In comparison, Snap's will increase rapidly from 0.6% to 2.7% in the same period.Can Twitter Rebound?Twitter's shares have recently been hit by several issues like terrorist accounts, bot problems and the top-level management exodus. However, the brand's popularity is hard to ignore as it has emerged from being a mere messaging platform to a powerful sociopolitical tool in the recent years.We believe that the subscription model can find takers among professionals, who prefer to work in an ad-free environment. A tiered pricing structure with additional features, much like LinkedIn, can actually help Twitter to attract new users. Moreover, the company's focus on promoting live video streaming will help the company to remain competitive in the market.Currently, Twitter carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

QuoteMoreover, the integration of Workflow's automation capabilities with Apple's private APIs is expected to make the process of developing Augmented Reality (AR) devices easier.AR Initiatives Present Growth OpportunityApple was not the first company to develop a smartphone. However, its flagship iPhone is an iconic product that has revolutionized the market. The device helped the company to strengthen its brand name as an ""innovator"" and boosted share price.Notably, since the launch of the first iPhone (Jun 29, 2007), the stock has gained a massive 708.3% compared with the ZacksComputer-Miniindustry's gain of 325.6%.However, Apple is now under tremendous pressure to launch a new product (especially after the lackluster Apple Watch), which can maintain its reputation. AR is one of the many fields under consideration. In fact, there have been quite a few rumors regarding the company's AR efforts as CEO Tim Cook has consistently emphasized on developing the technology in the last few months.Per Bloomberg, Apple has built a team combining people who have experience in working on Facebook'sFBOculus and Microsoft'sMSFTHoloLens. The company has also acquired several smaller firms with expertise in AR hardware, 3D gaming and virtual reality software.The market presents significant growth opportunity for Apple despite competition from AlphabetGOOGL, Microsoft and Facebook. According to Bloomberg, which quoted Global Market Insights figures, the global market for AR products will surge 80% to $165 billion by 2024.

Is India the Next Big Market for Apple's (AAPL) iPhones?;3/24/2017;"Indians will soon seeApple Inc.'sAAPLiPhone 6 and 6S models packaged with a tag line of 'Assembled in India'. Yes, it's true.PerThe Wall Street Journal, the company's Taiwanese supplier - Wistron - is likely to start making the aforesaid models in the next four to six weeks at its manufacturing facility in Bengaluru, India. It should be noted that Wistron, in late Dec 2016, sought permission for expansion of its manufacturing facility from the Indian government.Though, Apple's shares were down 0.4% yesterday, it has gained 21.6% so far this year. Notably, the stock's year-to-date return is almost in line with the Zacks categorizedComputer-Miniindustry's gain of 21.5%.Why is Apple Highly Focused on India?Since 2016, Apple has been increasing its focus on India to claim a greater share of the vast smartphone market in the country, of which it reportedly holds only 2% as of now. Apple has been facing a slowdown in iPhone demand in most regions, either because of stiff competition or regulatory hurdles (China) or market saturation (the U.S). Thus, it makes sense for the company to solidify/fortify its position in India, which is projected to become the second largest smartphone market in the world.Notably, in fiscal 2016, Apple sales in India surged approximately 50% over the prior fiscal. Moreover, during its last quarterly earnings conference call, the company revealed that its smartphone sales in the country registered 51% year-over-year growth in the first three quarters of fiscal 2017.Apple, of course, is not the only tech player eyeing India for growth. Given the potential of this market, Silicon Valley's interest is well understood. From Microsoft Corp.MSFTto AlphabetGOOGL, to Facebook Inc.FB, all remain laser focused on the Indian market.Furthermore, a younger and skilled population, along with increasing investment in broadband network by the government, makes India an attractive growth opportunity for Apple over the long run. In fact, the Indian government, under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, is eager to bring foreign capital and boost manufacturing facilities in the country.The recently outlined FDI policy by Indian government also bodes well for the company as it eliminates the requirement to locally source products for at least a three-year period. This will enable Apple to open its solely-owned retail stores in India. Thereafter, the company will have to comply with the rule. In addition, company has partnered with telecom company - Reliance - which is providing its Jio (a unique all-IP network) service for free with the new iPhones.Last year, Tim Cook was on a charm offensive in India. Besides meeting Modi, he also announced the opening of an iOS App Design and Development Accelerator in Bengaluru, as well as a map development office in another Indian city - Hyderabad - in collaboration with regional firm RMSI. He was also seen hobnobbing with industrialists and movie stars during his maiden visit to the country.Will the Move Aid Apple's Cause?Per analysts, the lion's share of Apple's revenues in the country comes from devices, which are a couple of generations old. Newer models have relatively low demand given the hefty price tag. According to reports, the Apple team in India is trying to increase revenues to $3 billion by fiscal 2017-18. Also, by local assembling operations, the company can start operating its own retail outlets and avail a 10% tax benefit. This, in turn, is likely to lower prices.However, a Forbes analyst observes that even if Apple starts production locally, the prices might not come down as much. This is because, at present, only assembling operations can be carried out in India as the country lacks a robust supply chain like China. Furthermore, the analyst argues that though labor cost in the country is cheaper than China, productivity is relatively better in China. Simple assembling may not drastically bring down prices. However, if India can ""spark"" a creation of local supply chain like China, then it will be a big positive.Moreover, another analyst observes that Apple's lack of focus on regional customers' demand is a pressing concern. India is categorized by handsets that work on dual SIMs. Apparently, Apple is not keen on making dual SIM handsets. This could be a very big impediment to growth in the country. The iPhone manufacturer is already late to the party. Its rival Samsung has long been in the market, and with reportedly 23% share, it is currently the leading player in the country.Bottom LineDespite Modi's historic move of demonetizing Rs 500 and Rs 1000 currency notes to combat corruption, the company registered all-time record revenue figures in third-quarter fiscal 2017, while its various competitors were hurt by the same. In our opinion, this shows Indians' immense love for Apple's products.However, the company lags behind its competitors on the pricing front. We believe that the latest move will allow Apple evade import duty tariffs. This will enable it to price its smartphones more competitively.Furthermore, by manufacturing iPhone models in India, Apple will be able to capture considerable market share in one of the world's fastest growing economy, where it has a meager presence when compared with other rivals such as Samsung, Micromax etc.Despite the pros and cons, Apple is expected to continue its expansion drive in India. The company will be taking up a lot more initiatives this year. However, whether those initiatives yield desirable results remains a wait and watch story.Currently, Apple carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Apple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) Siri resides on the iPhone, andAlphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) Google Assistant lives on the   company's Android ecosystem. With opposingvirtual assistantstaking up residence on hundreds of millions of phones worldwide,   how would Alexa ever compete? Several recent developments are   making this disadvantage less of an issue.Just one Amazon product powered by Alexa. Image source:     Amazon.makeArticleAd();Call meRecode isreportingthat Amazon is planning upgrades that would allow Alexa-powered   devices to initiate phone calls using voice commands. This new   communication functionality would extend to other Alexa devices,   working in much the same way as an intercom. If true, this   capability would partially address the disadvantage compared to   other digital assistants, which are primarily   smartphone-based.Amazon is taking other steps to counter its virtual   assistant's marked deficiency. Amazon reveled this week that   Alexa would soon be found in Amazon's official iPhone app,   already one of the more popular downloads in Apple's app store.   Users will be able to tap the microphone button inside the Amazon   app to access Alexa, which essentially brings its myriad of   skills to the iPhone. And it won't be the only phone sporting   Alexa. Earlier this year, Chinese phone giant Huawei revealed   that its Mate 9 phone would be the ""First smartphone with Amazon   Alexa."" With these recent announcements, it probably won't be   long before Alexa is available on Google's Android phones.Alexa gets an upgrade. Image source: Amazon.In my houseEstimates for sales of the Alexa family of products vary.   Consumer Intelligence Research Partners (CIRP)estimatesthat 8.2 million US consumers own an Alexa-powered device.   Analysts at Morgan Stanley estimated total sales at 11 million by   early December 2016, but admit that number is too low, having   missed out on the high-volume Black Friday and holiday sales.   Including strong holiday sales, those numbers could be in the   range of 13 to 15 million. With an estimated 125 million   U.S. households, Alexa could be nearing a 10% penetration   rate.What have you done for me lately?Alexa's popularity seems to stem from more than the mere   novelty of the product. Amazon released a skills kit early on   that encouraged developers to create voice commands, which   connected Alexa to their products and services. Amazon recentlyannouncedthat developers had published more than 10,000 skills for the   virtual assistant, giving it the clear lead in terms of   usefulness. With that many choices, you might wonder how to find   the skills most useful to you. Alexa has that covered, with a   Skill Finder feature that also presents a ""skill of the day"" for   the asking. Other popular offerings include games like the   Potterhead quiz for Harry Potter fans, trainer tips for fans ofPokemon Go, ordering your favoriteDomino'spizza, and even help deciding what to watch on TV or at the   movies.Foolish final thoughtsAddressing the key disadvantage that stood between Alexa and   consumers is an indication of how seriously the company views its   ecosystem. The family of products have even beenprominently displayedin Amazon's growing number of bookstores. Early sales won't make   a dent in Amazon's revenue, a gargantuan $44 billion in the   company's most recent quarter, so why the big push? A recent   analyst note may provide a clue. Mark Mahaney and Jim Shaughnessy   from RBC Capital Markets predict that it could be worth an   additional $10 billion in annual sales of devices and products by   2020. With that much riding on Alexa, it's no wonder that Amazon   would go to such lengths to up its game.10 stocks we like better than AmazonWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

TripAdvisor (TRIP) Rallies on Priceline Merger Talk;3/23/2017;"On Thursday, shares of TripAdvisor, Inc.TRIPrallied on PricelinePCLNbuyout talks. TRIP is up 2.54% to $42.42 per share. These two companies are no strangers on the buyout table. Buyout rumors have occurred a few times, but no deal was struck.The trade chatter resurfaced after shares of TRIP have lost about 8.2% since its last earnings report in February. The company reported both earnings and revenue misses. Adjusted fourth quarter earnings of $0.05 per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.18 per share. TripAdvisor reported revenues of $316 million, which again missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $325 million.While it may seem like TripAdvisor has some serious work to do on the business side, the company does possess valuable assets that another online agency can benefit tremendously from.Why Would It Work?By acquiring TripAdvisor, Priceline would make itself less dependent on Alphabet's GoogleGOOGLfor traffic to their website. It would gain TripAdvisor's 390 million monthly active users, as well as the 465 million users-produced reviews and opinions that cover hotels, vacation rentals, restaurants, attractions, and experiences. While Priceline's big platform, booking.com, is popular in Europe, it lacks traffic in the U.S. With TRIP, the marketing potential and presence in the U.S. will be significantly boosted.""If you think about Priceline as mostly getting people to the destination,"" said Motley Fool Analyst Matt Argersinger. ""While TripAdvisor has things they can do when they get to the destination. Priceline becomes more of a one-stop shop.""TripAdvisor's instant booking business will also gain more recognition and leverage from Priceline's presence.Why Wouldn't It Work?While it may sound extremely beneficial for Priceline to make the buyout, it might not be that easy.TripAdvisor, Priceline, and ExpediaEXPEare considered as the three big online travel agencies. If the TripAdvisor-Priceline merger does happen, it will hurt consumers, hotels, airlines, and rental companies because only the two big companies would be dictating the terms. It may be unlikely that the Department of Justice would approve the merger.Karina Lubell, a writer for The Capitol Forum, noted, ""When the DOJ cleared Expedia-Orbitz, it had little to do with their combined market share in travel booking.""TripAdvisor has a more prominent presence compared to Orbitz, as most of the global hotel chains have signed as TripAdvisor Instant Booking partners.Furthermore, Expedia and TripAdvisor have a connection through their shareholders. Liberty InteractiveLVNTA, the venture company, has a controlling stake in both Expedia and TripAdvisor. Liberty Interactive and Barry Diller own Expedia. Greg Maffei is the CEO of Liberty Interactive and also the Chairman of TripAdvisor.Bottom LineWhile the TripAdvisor merger will suit Priceline very well, as they will receive the tools needed to strengthen their foothold in the U.S. However, there are a few obstacles ahead if Priceline does consider purchasing TRIP.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!makeArticleAd();It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

Twitter (TWTR) Suspends Thousands of Terrorist Accounts;3/23/2017;"Twitter Inc.TWTRhas taken a strong step to counter terrorism by flagging accounts linked with terrorism on its platform. According to Twitter's latest bi-annual transparency report, the company has banned 636,248 accounts on grounds of violent extremism between Aug 2015 and Dec 2016.The company announced that out of the 636,248 accounts suspended so far, 376,890 accounts linked with terrorism are pulled down between Jul 2016 and Dec 2016. Consequently, this move raised the daily suspension rate by 80% compared with the last year.Moreover, 74% of these accounts were identified by the internal spam fighting tools of the company. One-third of the blocked accounts were automatically detected by these spam fighting tools as there is no specific algorithm to detect the terrorist related accounts.Twitter's proactive stance in eliminating terrorist activities on its platform will surely boost its brand value, which will attract advertisers eventually driving up top-line growth.Twitter, Inc.

2 Stocks Hedge Funds Love;3/23/2017;"Even as the industry contracts, many of the world's   largest and most successful hedge funds remain destinations for   capital and top investing talent. Often led by seasoned and savvy   founders, these organizations are widely followed in the media   and finance industries for their stock-picking prowess.Case in point: Market research firmFactSet Research Systemspublishes a quarterly tracker of the investing activities at what   it sees as the Top 50 global hedge funds. Here's a quick rundown   of two of the most popular stocks among the hedge fund elite as   of the fourth quarter of 2016.Image source: ComcastmakeArticleAd();ComcastOwned by 22 of the top 50 hedge funds, vertically integrated   cable giantComcast(NASDAQ: CMCSA)  is one the most interesting stocks in media   today, asI discusseda few weeks ago. The reason is straightforward: Comcast is   one of the few cable companies poised to capitalize from the   increased overlap in the telecom and media industries.In the coming years, telecom companies such asAT&Tsee a major opportunity to evolve the traditional bundle of TV,   internet, and phone service into a new format in which TV   programming flows over wireless networks directly to mobile   devices. This is the underlying strategy behind AT&T's deal   to buyTime Warner. Comcast is one of the fortunate few, in addition to   AT&T, in a position to create a similar ""mobile bundle,"" much   to shareholders' benefit.Comcast owns key content assets including NBC, Bravo, CNBC,   and much more that should allow it to secure the rights to stream   cable programming over its coming mobile network. It also   has secured spectrum rights from other telecom companies and is   actively working to buy its own wireless spectrum via the FCC's   ongoing auction process.In short, hedge funds love Comcast because it's well suited to   become one of the few pure-play mobile cable operators in the   years to come.Image source: FacebookFacebookOf the 50 large hedge funds included in the survey, an   impressive 27 of them owned shares in the world's largest social   network, makingFacebook(NASDAQ: FB) the most widely held stock in FactSet's report.The bullishness is well founded. Even as Facebook has grown   into one of the world's largest publicly traded companies, its   momentum has shown no signs of slowing. Facebook has grown its   sales from $3.7 billion in fiscal 2011 to $27.6 billion in fiscal   2016, establishing itself as the only viable potential rival   toAlphabet's digital advertising empire. That's an incredible run, and one   of the more impressive growth trajectories from a large-cap   company that comes to mind.Facebook has also invested in a handful of emerging   technologies with an enviable degree of foresight. Mark   Zuckerberg and company understood the coming importance of   messaging apps as global channels for communication, commerce,   and much more develop. Many argue that messaging apps such as   Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp,Line Corp., and more will eventually become a new layer of software, akin   to the operating systems that power PC and smartphones   today. Messenger and WhatsApp -- which Facebook   acquired in February 2014 for a massive $19 billion, including   incentives -- both sport user bases of over 1 billion   monthly active users today.Facebook also spent $2 billion to acquire virtual-reality (VR)   start-up Oculus in March 2014. And though VR remains in its early   stages of development,Goldman Sachsresearch estimates that sales of VR hardware and software will   reach $80 billion by 2025.  Meanwhile, some have heralded   Facebook's $1 billion purchase of Instagram -- which has been   valued at as much at $50 billion in recent years -- as the   smartest tech acquisition of all time.Indeed, Zuckerberg is one of the world's most skilled   technology executives today. At just 32, he should be   around to benefit Facebook investors with his unique ability   for years to come. And given its unique mix of present-day   profitability and continued long-term potential, Facebook could   remain a hedge fund industry darling for quite some time.10 stocks we like better than FacebookWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

GOOGL Stock Is Falling Into a Funk;3/23/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe recent downturn inAlphabetInc(NASDAQ:GOOGL) became a little more exacerbated on Thursday morning, and now GOOGL stock is starting to dip into some dangerous territory.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockPivotal Research Group analyst Brian Wieser downgraded Alphabet shares on Monday, March 20, from ""Buy"" to ""Hold.""Wieser's issue was a number of large companies, includingMcDonald's Corporation(NYSE:MCD), bailing out their advertisements from the YouTube video platform over lack of targeting capabilities. The specific worry is that ads will be shown alongside videos from extremist and terrorist groups, as well as anything portraying hate speech.AT&T Inc(NYSE:T) andVerizon Communications Inc.(NYSE:VZ) have also pulled their ads since then. Per an AT&T spokesperson:""We are deeply concerned that our ads may have appeared alongside YouTube content promoting terrorism and hate. Until Google can ensure this won't happen again, we are removing our ads from Google's non-search platforms.""Other companies that have dropped their YouTube ads includeHSBC Holdings plc (ADR)(NYSE:HSBC),GlaxoSmithKline plc (ADR)(NYSE:GSK) andEnterprise. The price target drop - from $970 to $950 - betrayed the downgrade a little, as that still implied roughly 10% upside in GOOGL stock from there.10 Small-Cap Stocks That Could Double in the Next 3 MonthsNonetheless, shares fell hard on the news, dropping nearly 4% between then and now, including a roughly 2% drop in Thursday's early trading.GOOGL shares plunged below their short-term 20-day average initially, and today have sunk below the 50-day moving average, which has provided support for shares twice since mid-December, when the stock surged through the MA.The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has plunged to 38 - low, but still not near oversold levels.From here, GOOGL stock risks a further drop to price support around $810 - another 3% from here. Below that would be the 200-day MA, which sits just below the $800 mark.Has Apple Stock Peaked? Not Even CloseLooked at optimistically, though, Alphabet has been setting a small series of higher lows and higher highs since the beginning of the new year, precipitously dropping off in February before rebounding to hit new highs above $870 just last week.This very well could be a much-needed breather in GOOGL stock - one that has dunked the forward price-to-earnings ratio to a thoroughly digestible 21, which isn't shabby for a nearly $600 billion company that's still projected to grow revenues by double digits this year and next.As of this writing, Robert Martin did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceAMD Confirms It: Ryzen CPUs Are Locking Up PCsBank of America: BAC Stock Is a SAFETY Play?The 10 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold ForeverThe postGOOGL Stock Is Falling Into a Funkappeared first onInvestorPlace."

The declining popularity is not a big concern because the bigger iPhone 7 Plus alleviates any need for a tablet. The iPad Pro also fills a gap between smartphones and laptops.10 Small-Cap Stocks That Could Double in the Next 3 MonthsApple is treating the tablet market as a mature business line. After 12 consecutive quarters of falling sales, theiPad refresh at a lower pricemight be able to change that trend. The thing is, while the actual iPad has become cheaper, the iPad Mini 2 has dropped - meaning the cheapest tablet you can buy is now $60 more expensive.Strong Demand for iPhone 7On the flip side, Apple is riding strong iPhone 7 demand. In the most recent quarter, iPhone 7 Plus sales grew as a proportion of total sales. Demand was so strong that it exceed supply throughout the quarter. Apple finally balanced supply and demand levels in January.In the quarter, the company sold 78.3 million units - an all-time high for the company, and a 5% increase year-over-year.Now, with the launch of theRED iPhone 7, Apple might be able to keep up interest ahead of its new iPhone out later this year.MacBook Refresh Is UninspiringAfter many years of little change, Apple finally refreshed the Macbook Pro. The ""Touch Bar"" is the biggest change on the laptop. Unfortunately, Apple removedMagSafe, which many tech sites (likeQuartzand The Verge) and consumers dub is the smartest invention ever.Investors need not concern themselves on changes to the MacBook failing to spur sales. iPhone sales still make up the bulk of revenue and growth, while the Services division is elevating the company's profitability.iPhone 8Whispers and rumors have been going at a mile a minute surrounding an iPhone 8, marking the 10th anniversary for the successful device.One may criticize the fact that iPhone 7's only major enhancement is the improved camera.

But that will change in the next couple of years, so Apple's timing is just fine.Bottom Line on Apple StockApple is in fine shape, thus AAPL is in fine shape.AMD Confirms It: Ryzen CPUs Are Locking Up PCsWarren Buffett, legendary for his value stock picks, is holding more Apple stock than ever.

But that cash also distorts the valuation - and in fact makes the argument that AAPL should carry a much higher P/E given just how much in raw cash it holds.Apple stock is a buy, even if gains don't come in a straight line from here.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceWednesday Apple Rumors: Hackers Plan to Wipe Millions of iPhones on April 7The 7 Most Popular Vanguard Funds for 401k Plans9 Stocks to Buy That Are Growing Faster Than AmazonThe postHas Apple Stock Peaked?

Fitbit Plunges to 52-Week Low: Three Reasons to Stay Away;3/23/2017;"Shares ofFitbit, Inc.FIThit a 52-week low of $5.42 on Mar 22.The stock declined 8.7% since it posted fourth quarter 2016 loss on Feb 22 against the ZacksElectronics - Measuring Instrumentsindustry's decline of 3.6%.Notably, the company's shares have lost a mammoth 81.6% since Jun 18, 2016, the day on which the company began trading on the New York stock exchange.Fitbit, Inc. Net Income (TTM)|Fitbit, Inc. QuoteApple Running Fitbit into the GroundFitbit's growth has been slowing down with smartwatches outshining the fitness wearable category, influx of new wearables, lack of upgrades among existing users and lackluster growth in the Asia Pacific region.Despite the broad range of devices Fitbit provides at different price points, it faces competition at both the high- and low-end products. At the high end, there is Apple'sAAPLmulti-functional Apple Watch, which renders Fitbit devices useless. There are other big manufacturers who are developing connected devices on AlphabetGOOGLowned Google's Android operating system. At the lower end, there are fitness-tracking devices from competitors like Jawbone and GarminGRMN, which also give it strong competition.With Fitbit bringing in counter strategies through the roll out new products, buying smaller companies and increasing marketing spend, its operating expenses as a percentage of revenues have increased to 53.1% in the fourth quarter of 2016 from 34% in the year-ago quarter. Increasing expenses coupled with slower revenue growth forced the company to post a net adjusted loss of 63 cents per share in the fourth quarter of 2016.Fitbit, Inc. Net Income (TTM)Recent Executive Shakeup Fails to Infuse HopeThe recent decline appears to be prompted by its announcement of an executive shakeup a few days back. With chief business officer, Woody Scal and executive vice president, Interactive, Tim Roberts, stepping down, it appears that investors are not much hopeful about the company's comeback.Concurrent with the announcement, Fitbit said that it will realign under two main businesses - Consumer Health & Fitness and Enterprise Health. The Consumer Health & Fitness business will focus on delivering more efficient health and fitness devices, diversifying into the smartwatch category and offering premium software and services.Enterprise Health, on the other hand, will enhance focus on developing and strengthening relationships with employees, insurance companies, health systems and healthcare partners. Only time will tell if these moves really work and give Fitbit a chance to make a comeback.Downward Estimate RevisionsFor the full year, five estimates have moved down in the past 60 days, compared with no upward revisions. This has caused the consensus estimate to trend lower, going from earnings of 29 cents a share 60 days ago to its current level of a loss of 62 cents.Also, for the current quarter, Fitbit has seen two downward estimate revisions versus no upward revision, which dragged the consensus estimate down to a loss of 25 cents a share from a loss of 5 cents over the past 60 days.So it may not be a good decision to keep this stock in your portfolio anymore, at least if you don't have a long-time horizon to wait.Currently, Fitbit is a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock.You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy)   stocks here.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

AT&T & Verizon Suspend Marketing Advertisements from YouTube;3/23/2017;"U.S. telecom behemothsAT&T Inc.TandVerizon Communications Inc.VZhave decided to suspend their marketing campaign on Google's YouTube site. The reason behind the decision is the appearance of their ads alongside offensive and highly controversial videos promoting adult contents, terrorism and hate speeches. Notably, Google is a division of Alphabet Inc.GOOGL.Yesterday, the two companies announced that they are suspending all their advertising from Google's non-search platforms, including YouTube as well as third-party websites that Google partners with. The withdrawal will stand until Google permanently solves the problem. So far, more than 250 companies have pulled their advertisements from YouTube including Johnson & JohnsonJNJ, the world's biggest health-care company.The decision of Verizon and AT&T is significant as telephone operators are among the biggest block of advertisers in corporate America. The two companies together spent $6.6 billion in advertisement in 2015. According to Kantar Media, Verizon and AT&T were the third and fourth largest ad spenders in the U.S. in 2016.Importantly, the two telecom giants have withdrawn their ads from Google's non-search platforms only. However, Google's search service generates the majority of its advertisement revenues which was a whopping $79.4 billion in 2016. Although Google doesn't disclose how much of its ad revenues came from YouTube, research firm eMarketer estimated it to be around $5.6 billion and has projected this figure to reach $7 billion in 2017.At this stage, it is worth mentioning that Alphabet Inc. has been in a tussle with AT&T and Verizon during the last couple of years over several regulatory issues related to broadband and data privacy.

The Future of Virtual Reality: 5 Things to Know;3/22/2017;"Virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) technologies   have gotten a lot of attention over the past few years.Sony's PlayStation VR headset is shining a spotlight onthe viability of VR gaming, whileAlphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL)  Google Cardboard and new   Daydream View headsets are pushing mobile VR into the mainstream.   The unexpected success of Pokemon Go last year showed that   smartphone users are ready and willing to adopt augmented   reality. AndMicrosoft's(NASDAQ: MSFT)  development of its HoloLens goggles aim to   prove that the virtual and augmented worlds will soon become a   part of our reality.Investors looking to benefit from these two intertwined   markets should keep these five things in mind:Image source: Google.makeArticleAd();1. The future of VR could be our next computing     platformMuch of the attention surrounding virtual reality right now   has to do mainly with how it will be used for gaming, filmmaking,   or other entertainment content. ButFacebook(NASDAQ: FB) CEO Mark Zuckerberg believes that VR could surpass   all of these categories.He said in a Bloomberginterviewlast year that VR is ""a good candidate to be the next major   computing platform."" Zuckerberg thinks it'll take a while for us   to get there (more on that later), but he's optimistic that VR   could be a primary form of communication technology in the near   future:Photos are richer than text; video, much richer than photos.     But that's not the end, right? I mean, it's like this     indefinite continuum of getting closer and closer to being able     to capture what a person's natural experience and thought is,     and just being able to immediately capture that and design it     however you want and share it with whomever you want.2. It will take a while for VR to gain     tractionVR is still in its very early stages, and it's likely that it   will take many more years before it becomes mainstream --   Zuckerberg has put the timeframe at five to 10 years.Adding to the slow pace is the fact that some hyped   technologies, like Magic Leap's AR headset, have recently been   found to be behind schedule.The Informationreported(subscription required) at the end of the last year that Magic   Leap -- which has raised $1.4 billion in funding in about three   years -- pivoted away from some of its earlier fiber optic   technologies and now trails the image quality of Microsoft's   HoloLens.And even the HoloLens, which currently costs $3,000 and is   mainly for developers, has sold only thousands of units. Roger   Walkden, Microsoft's HoloLens commercial lead,recently toldThe Inquirerthat, ""We're not trying to sell hundreds of thousands or millions   or anything, it's expensive, and it's not in huge numbers. So   we're happy with the level of sales that we've got -- I can't   tell you anything about the numbers, but it's in thousands, not   hundreds of thousands, and that's fine. That's all we need.""While Microsoft may be pleased with those numbers, it's still   a clear indicator that VR and AR have a long way go before they   become mainstream.And then there's the recent news that Facebook's Oculus is   shutting down 200 of its 500 demo sites within Best Buy   stores, reportedly due to thelack of public interest. The future may be virtual, but we're getting there slowly.3. It offers a new way of seeing our worldJason Pontin, the editor of MIT'sTechnology Review,recentlyinterviewedJessica Brillhart, a filmmaker for virtual reality at   Google, and talked with her about how VR is currently used and   what it might become in the near future. When asked if   people will eventually use VR to record home videos, Brillhart   responded that we probably would but that it might not be a good   thing,Think of everything you forget about a birthday party when     you're a kid. But now the rig would capture everything. You     could watch someone you loved respond the way she used to, or     eat cake a certain way. It is going to be interesting to see     what happens when we aren't able to forget anything     anymore.The interview is a good reminder that VR is still in its early   stages and it's still unclear how this platform will be used, and   whether or not we'll like exactly how it turns out.4. Virtual reality could eventually impact all of the     sensesRight now, VR is limited to a user's visual and auditory   senses, but in the future this will likely be enhanced.   The general manager of Dell's gaming PC manufacturer   Alienware, Frank Azor, said thisin an interviewwith TIME last year:Once you begin catering to the rest of the senses, like what     we feel body-wise, temperature-wise, and smell, the reality     factor of virtual reality [becomes] stronger and the virtual     piece begins to fade.Breaking the barrier between the virtual world and the   physical world with high-end touch sensors could be the next step   in virtual reality, and it won't be here for a while, but VR   hardware and software makers are already thinking about how this   technology can go from immersive to fully interactive.5. The market potential for both AR and VR could be     hugeThe virtual reality market was worth about $1.9 billion in   2016, but that's expected to climb to $22.4 billion by 2020.   Those numbers include both software and hardware sales. And when   you factor in AR sales, the market skyrockets even higher. The   combined AR and VR market will be worth $121 billion by 2021,   according to Digi-Capital.In that same year, IDC estimates more than 99 million AR and   VR headsets will be shipped, up from just 10 million last year,   which represents a 58% compound annual growth rate between 2016   and 2021..The good news for investors is that companies are just getting   started with AR and VR, which meansthe opportunities to benefit haven't passed. There are still plenty of unknowns, but as more companies rally   around these new technologies and make the necessary investments   to get them off of the ground, we're likely to see the future of   AR and VR develop substantially over the next few years.10 stocks we like better than FacebookWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Is Alphabet Stock a Good Way to Invest in Self-Driving Cars?;3/22/2017;"Three things seem pretty clear at this point in history:Self-driving cars will begin coming to market before     long.They'll generate huge profits for some companies.Google has been a leader in developing self-driving     technology.But does it follow that Google's parent,Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) , will reap the rewards of its   technological leadership? Or put another way, are the potential   profits from self-driving cars a reason to add Alphabet's stock   to your portfolio?A lot of commentators seem to think so, but I'm very   skeptical. Here's why.makeArticleAd();Driverless ""panda cars"" were the public face of the Google     Self-Driving Car Project for several years. Image source:     Alphabet.Alphabet has what looks like a leadership position...Google began tinkering with self-driving cars way back in   2009, long before many investors began taking the technology   seriously. The original team behind what became knows as the   Google Self-Driving Car Project included several robotics   all-stars who seemed ready to invent the future. The whole thing   appeared to be decades beyond what the established automakers   were doing.For a while, it was. Of course, in the last few years, some   automakers and auto-industry suppliers have invested heavily in   the technology and made significant gains. But even so,   Alphabet's self-driving unit, which was spun out of Google and   renamed Waymo late last year, retains some big advantages:By at least one measure -- ""disengagements,"" the number of     times a human driver has to take control of a self-driving test     car -- Waymo made major progress last year andappears to be aheadof most known rivals.Maps. The first self-driving cars to come to market will     rely heavily on highly detailed maps as a backup to their     sensors. Google has been mapping the world in ever-increasing     detail for years; Waymo will have access to those maps, while     its competitors will have to look elsewhere.Waymo has developed its own self-driving sensor hardware,     including -- crucially -- LIDAR units that cost much less than     current commercially available units.Those are significant advantages. But there's a big question   that might not be obvious to investors who don't have a deep   understanding of the auto industry:How will Waymo bring all of that to market?Waymo's current test fleet was built in partnership with     FCA, but the companies have disclosed no plans to collaborate     on production vehicles. Image source: Fiat Chrysler Automobiles     NV....but bringing it to market may prove complicatedWaymo's CEO, John Krafcik, is a respected auto-industry   veteran who was hired to lead the project in September 2015.   Krafcik brought a welcome dose of realistic transparency to the   project when he made it clear that Alphabet has no intention of   manufacturing its own vehicles. Instead, he said, Waymo would   seek to bring its technology to market via partnerships with   established automakers.There's just one problem: The automakers aren't exactly   beating down Krafcik's door. In fact, the auto executives I've   talked with feel that they have very good reasons to steer clear   of a deal with Waymo, starting with control of the data generated   by self-driving cars.It's almost an understatement to say that automakers areveryaware of the smartphone precedent. The phone makers that chose to   adopt the Android operating system ended up making hardware on   very slim margins. Alphabet ended up with most of the profits,   because Android provided it with the (immensely valuable) users'   data.Auto executives don't want to end up in the same boat, and   they know that they'll soon have alternatives that will allow   them to keep at least some control of the data. At least one   alternative, a partnership betweenDelphi Automotive(NYSE: DLPH) ,Intel(NASDAQ: INTC) , andMobileye(NYSE: MBLY) , aims to have a self-driving system available to   any automaker that wants it by the end of 2019. That partnership   will allow automakers to retain much of the data, and auto   executives see it as homegrown -- created largely by   established industry suppliers, not by Silicon Valley   hotshots.Given that, why go with Waymo?That said, a couple of big automakers have kicked the tires on   Waymo's technology:Fiat Chrysler Automobiles(NYSE: FCAU) worked with Google engineers last year to createthe latest vehicles for Waymo's test fleet, based on the well-regarded Chrysler Pacifica minivan --     but there's no sign that the two will move forward on anything     that could lead to a product for sale.Honda(NYSE: HMC) issued a somewhat odd announcement in December     saying that it was ""entering into formal discussions"" with     Waymo, though nothing (so far) seems to have resulted from     those discussions. (I speculated at the time that Honda's     announcement might have been aboutprodding other potential partners to take     action. But at least as of right now, it's not clear exactly what was     going on there.)Waymo may well find a profitable line of business in selling   its sensors to other companies. And it's likely that some   automaker, somewhere, will eventually give its self-driving   system a try.But unless other research and development efforts hit   roadblocks that Waymo is somehow able to skirt, it seems unlikely   that it will be a dominant player in self-driving systems anytime   in the near future.The upshot: Don't buy Alphabet just for self-drivingThere are plenty of good reasons to consider adding Alphabet   to your portfolio. But if you're looking for a targeted   self-driving investment, Alphabet probably isn't it: As of right   now, it's not clear that Waymo will ever add much to the search   giant's bottom line.10 stocks we like better than AlphabetWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Buy the Baidu Inc (ADR) (BIDU) Stock Dip;3/22/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsChinese tech companyBaidu Inc (ADR)(NASDAQ:BIDU) has been called ""the Google of China,"" but BIDU stock's steady decline over the past six months suggests that the company is nowhere near comparable toAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG,NASDAQ:GOOGL).makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockIn mid-February, BIDU looked to be on the upswing, but the firm'sfourth-quarter earningsdealt a heavy blow to Baidu stock.With BIDU shares down nearly 10% from where they were a month ago, however, this dip could translate into a buying opportunity.Baidu EarningsIt's true that Baidu reported less-than-stellar earnings last month. The company's quarterly revenue came in a $2.6 billion, which represents a decline of more than 2% from last year's figures.5 Big Financial Stocks That Just Got Leveled (And What to Do Next)Even more concerning was the fact that online marketing customers declined 18.6% in 2016. For investors that consider BIDU to be the Chinese Google, that's a huge deal. Advertising dollars are everything to search engines like Baidu and Google.It's Not as Bad as It LooksThose figures are certainly scary, but when you look at the reason behind them things start to look a little bit rosier. It's important to note that BIDU faced some major headwinds last year, including a big change to China's advertising regulations. The cost to comply with the new rules was significant for Baidu, whichgenerates around 96% of its revenue from advertising.Not only did the new regulations hit BIDU's revenue hard, but they also hurt the firm's customers numbers. The new regulations include strict rules regarding how companies advertise and some of Baidu's current customers weren't able to meet those requirements, which resulted in a loss.However, there could be a silver lining in there for BIDU as the new requirements will help the firm identify who its quality customers are. If you look at per-customer spend, you'll see that those who were able to meet the new guidelines actually spent about 14% more than they had in the fourth quarter of 2015.Huge Growth Potential for BIDU StockWhat's important to note here is that even if BIDU is struggling now, there is a huge growth opportunity for internet companies in China. While you might think that a search engine doesn't have room to expand any further, keep in mind that China is pretty far behind the U.S. when it comes to internet users.  Just over 50% of the nation's populationhas access to the internet.That's a big deal, because it means that as the internet makes its way further afield, advertisers are going to be willing to pay to reach even more people. Eventually, online advertising will be the best way to reach the majority of Chinese residents, and marketers will have to pay for that.Bottom Line on BIDU StockNot only does BIDU have a lot of growth potential in its core business, but the firm has been investing heavily in hot new technology like artificial intelligence and self-driving vehicles. While advertising revenue still makes up the bulk of Baidu's bottom line, we could see big-time benefits from the firm's focus on the future.The company's efforts to develop self-driving technology are particularly enticing because the cars' navigation systems will be equipped to deal with China's complicated traffic conditions. That means that once the vehicles are roadworthy, tweaking their technology to make them usable on U.S. roads will be far easier than trying to do it the other way around.Baidu Inc (ADR) (BIDU) Stock Is Just Giving Away MoneyBIDU's fourth-quarter results were definitely scary on the surface, but things aren't as bad as the market would have you believe. If you have ever considered buying BIDU stock, now is the time to do it.As of this writing, Laura Hoy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace8 Places to Run and Hide in a Market Crash10 Safe Dividend Stocks to Own During the Next Market CrashThe postBuy the Baidu Inc (ADR) (BIDU) Stock Dipappeared first onInvestorPlace."
FANG Stocks are Back in Focus;3/22/2017;"A while ago someone noticed that if you took the first letters of the names of the four big modern tech companies, Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Google (GOOG:GOOGL) they spelled out a wonderful acronym, FANG. Of course, since then Google has gone and spoiled it all by rebranding their holding company as alphabet, but the acronym has stuck.At the risk of spoiling that alphabetic synergy I would add Apple (AAPL) to the list, given that companies role as the largest of the tech stocks. In fact some people substitute Apple for Amazon and obviously if you do that you still get FANG rather than the less appealing FAANG. For argument’s sake, let’s assume that all five stocks are still collectively known as the fang stocks, and right now they look like a good place to be.The reason, though, is less about tech, or indeed about business at all, than it is about politics. The market seems to be driven at the moment by what comes out of the White House. Since the election there has been a lot of faith placed by traders and investors in certain policies outlined by the new administration and the Republicans who dominate Congress during the campaign; a “beautiful” replacement for Obamacare, for example, as well as tax reform and infrastructure spending.makeArticleAd();Yesterday’s drop in the stock market, the biggest of the year so far, was reportedly triggered by worries about the healthcare bill slated to replace the Affordable Care Act. It has met with opposition from within the Republican Party, particularly from the Right, and needs some serious negotiation in order to just pass the House.That in itself would be a bad thing if repeal went ahead without the replacement passed, as most acknowledge that something has to fill the vacuum.More worrying for the market, though, is that if this bill fails, it will indicate that the fiscal conservatives in Congress are sticking to their principles, making stimulative infrastructure spending a virtual non-starter.Some of the biggest losers yesterday were in the industrial and material sectors that have gained the most since the election and which would be hurt most by delays in infrastructure spending. The reason the fang stocks look so attractive right now is because policy delays regarding healthcare and infrastructure spending will have little effect on them in the short term, but things like tax reform when it does come, especially the possibility of the repatriation of overseas profits, will make an enormous difference. The consensus is that tax reform is an area that unites the party and thus could be even hastened by a split over the Obamacare replacement.The fly in the ointment could be that much of the potential growth for these firms lies in overseas expansion, in particular to emerging economies. That would be a worry if the White House does push for more isolationist trade relationships, but again the fact that the Freedom Caucus free market types in the GOP are flexing their muscles would suggest that any eventual move would have to be negotiated, and therefore moderated from the campaign rhetoric.All in all, then, things look good for Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google. That belief seems to have taken hold today as each of the tech big five has bucked the downward trend of the broader market and gained in early trading. Of course one swallow doth not a summer make, but the logic behind these stocks’ contrarian behavior is hard to refute and they may prove to be a hedge against politics driven uncertainty over the next few weeks, or even months."
Does Facebook's Video Strategy Make It a Top Growth Stock?;3/22/2017;"Yesterday,FacebookFBwas assigned a Buy rating by BTIG analyst Rich Greenfield, who was quoted by media reports saying, ""Not having a buy [rating] on Facebook has clearly been a mistake in 2017."" He further added that ""the secular trends toward mobile devices globally and the accelerating shift of ad dollars are simply too strong to ignore.""Facebook's Video StrategySince last year, Facebook has been aggressively promoting live video content on its platform. Online video is emerging as a big opportunity to boost ad revenues. Ad revenues contribute over 95% to Facebook's total revenue. Earlier, it was reported that the company is looking to grab a share of the reportedly $70 billion brand advertising that is allocated to linear TV by increasing video content on its platform.  At its last earnings call, Facebook said that video has emerged as a ""megatrend"" on the same lines like mobile.Last year, the company signed deals with media houses and Internet celebrities to churn out more content for its live platform and added a plethora of new features to Facebook live.  These include enabling broadcast for a Group or Event and at the same time allowing audience to respond to the live broadcast in real time through Live Reactions. Also, recently, it brought on board an ex-MTV executive,Mina Lefevre, to increase original live video content on the platform.In fact, it has been on a signing spree to bring more live video content, especially sports. Streaming, particularly live sports, is one of the most lucrative opportunities as it helps to boost engagement levels (especially millennials) and brings more advertisers. Facebook has struck a deal with MLB and has collaborated with Univision Communications Inc. to live stream 46 Liga MX games for an undisclosed amount.Mobile and live video efforts are paying off big time for the social media giant.  In the last reported quarter, revenues of $8.8 billion increased 51% year over year. Advertising revenues were $8.629 billion, surging 53% year over year.Mobile ad revenues in the quarter were $7.2 billion (up 61% year over year), contributing 84% to total ad revenues.Facebook, Inc. PriceFacebook, Inc. Price|Facebook, Inc. QuoteEven Instagram has emerged as a big cash cow with over 500,000 advertisers. It is the second big ad platform after Facebook's namesake platform, though the company has so far refrained from providing actual ad numbers for Instagram. The latest Instagram-feature ""Stories"", though a SnapchatSNAPclone, looks set to lure more advertisers this year. Instagram boasts over 600 million MAUs and over 400 million DAUs while ""Stories"" on the platform have 150 million daily actives.At the last earnings call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg continued to emphasize on bringing more video content to the platform. He also informed that the company has been investing on original content and that it will keep doing the same this year as well. Facebook is also beta-testing mid roll ads in its video content to boost its ad revenues.Though Facebook's video strategy looks good on paper, it will be one big task to actually make it work given a number of challenges. Per media reports, ""professional content producers, such as CNN, HBO and Comedy Central, presents a higher quality, which garners deeper engagement and ad dollars"" and this where Facebook might suffer. Also, the competition for ad dollars from the likes of Alphabet'sGOOGLYouTube, TwitterTWTRand Snapchat is also unnerving.Plus, the fake news dissemination problem on its platform has been a raging controversy all through the last year. Fake news problem will definitely impact attracting advertisers.Our TakeContinuous rise in advertising revenues as well as its strategic efforts to sustain the growth momentum has put Facebook on investors' favorite stock pick list. Notably, in the past one year, Facebook's shares have generated a return of 23.39%, compared with the ZacksInternet Servicesindustry's return of 9.11%.Furthermore, Facebook has aGrowth StyleScore of ""A"". We note that our Growth Style Score encompasses all the essential metrics from a company's financial statements to get a true sense of the quality and sustainability of growth.

The Google Ad Controversy:  Should it Matter to Investors?;3/22/2017;"Alphabet Inc.'sGOOGLGoogle is currently in the news regarding the issue of ads emerging next to YouTube videos that display homophobic and anti-Semitic contents.The UK Government called upon Google last Thursday after ads for taxpayer-funded bodies like The Royal Air Force, The Royal Navy and BBC appeared next to ""extremist"" YouTube videos.The Government has suspended all its advertising from Google until further confirmation about those ads no longer appearing against questionable contents. The stock has lost 2.4% since, against the ZacksInternet-Servicesindustry's loss of 0.11%.Google has been summoned for the second time this week to provide the government an update of the efforts it has been making to ensure that ads appear in undisputed environments.Google's Initial Response Seemed a Bit WeakGoogle did give an explanation in a blog post the next day, stating that the company has policies to debar ads from appearing on pages or videos with offensive or derogatory contents. But implementation is not always easy, given the millions of sites in its network. Moreover, 400 hours of video get uploaded to Youtube every minute, which makes the implementation doubly difficult. The company, however, said that it had already initiated a review of the problem.Nevertheless, the investor community did not seem satisfied with a ""half-hearted"" explanation. A rating downgrade came the very next working day, with Pivotal Research analyst Brian Wieser downgrading Google parent Alphabet from ""Buy"" to ""Hold"".Adding to Google's troubles, the issue that primarily appeared to be centered on the U.K, went global in no time, with over 250 brands suspending their advertising on Youtube. The list includes big names from private as well as public sectors-Transport for London, The FCA, HSBCHSBC, ToyotaTM, McDonald'sMCD, Heinz, The guardian, Channel 4, , L'Oreal, Marks & Spencer, Hargreaves Lansdown and Sainsbury's.A Clear Policy Revamp Announcement FollowedThe severity of the issue forced Google to make some ""serious"" announcements the following day. The company posted some notable policy revamps that include a commitment to more fine-tuned advertiser controls, adding safer defaults, expanding video-level reporting for advertisers and increaseing investments to implement its ad policies faster.Google also mentioned its plans to add a significant number of staff and deploy latest Artificial Intelligence (AI) powered tools to assess dubious content.Should Investors be Wary?Google is embroiled in a legal battle across practically all continents and issues like this are likely to add to its woes, at least in the short haul. Apart from being a huge drain on ad revenues, these give it a bad name.Alphabet Inc. Revenue (TTM)Alphabet Inc. Revenue (TTM)|Alphabet Inc. QuoteNevertheless, the company has had extraordinary success in the courtroom and with government officials around the world. But developments like these are worth keeping an eye on and remain an overhang on the shares, at least for the time being.In the long run, we don't believe the issue will pose any severe threat to the company, given Google's long history of execution, leading search market share and growing focus on innovation, strategic acquisitions and android OS. With huge cash balance and technological prowess, the company has the flexibility to pursue growth in any area that exhibits true potential.Currently, Alphabet has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock is Autohome Inc.

Internap, GCP Applied Technologies, Twitter and Google highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day;3/22/2017;"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL - March 22, 2017 -Zacks Equity ResearchhighlightsInternap(NASDAQ:INAP-Free Report) as the Bull of the Day,GCP Applied Technologies( NYSE:GCP-Free Report) as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis onTwitter Inc.(NYSE:TWTR-Free Report)andGoogle(NASDAQ:GOOGL-Free Report).Here is a synopsis of all four stocks:Bull of the Day:Internap(NASDAQ:INAP-Free Report) is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and has an ""A"" for both Growth and Momentum. The stock has been bouncing up against 52 week highs and looks to continue to do more of the same. It is the Bull of The Day today.DescriptionInternap Corporation provides information technology infrastructure services. It operates through two business segments, Data Center Services and Internet Protocol (IP) Services. The Data Center Services segment provides colocation services comprising physical space within data centers and associated services, such as power, interconnection, environmental controls, monitoring, and security. Internap Corporation was founded in 1996 and is headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia.Sticking With What WorksThere is little doubt that we are in a long term bull market. One of the best ways to play this market is by buying the stocks that are seeing positive developments and are hitting new highs. INAP has both of these even and the market breaks a long streak of days without a 1% drawdown.Earnings HistoryThe earnings history isn't exactly a stellar one. I see two beats and two misses in the last four outings. None of the last four reports saw the company outperform on the top line either. But something did catch my eye.The most recent report was a beat of $0.03 which translated into a positive earnings surprise of 20%. This solid beat caused the stock to jump more than 31% in the session following the release. That has a way of making the chart look great!EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for CY2017 saw a huge boost following the most recent earnings report. The number moved from a loss of $0.57 in January to a loss of $0.52 in February and is now at a loss of just $0.34. That is a big move in the right direction.The CY18 number has also seen a dramatic move higher, going from a loss of $0.50 to a loss of $0.24 and settling at a loss of $0.16 over the same time period.If the company continues to beat expectations, profitability could come by the end of the year.ValuationWithout the benefit of positive earnings we don't get to lean on the PE for our look at valuation. Instead we have to look at the conservative measure of price to book which has the stock trading at a discount to the market. INAP trades at about 4x book, but the industry average is trading closer to 6.5x. The more aggressive measure of price to sales show the stock trading at 0.7x compared to a 6.2x industry average. Both of these metrics show considerable room for growth.Bear of the Day:GCP Applied Technologies( NYSE:GCP-Free Report) is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). The company has missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last three quarters and it is the Bear of the Day today.DescriptionGCP Applied Technologies Inc. offer specialty construction chemicals and building materials as well as packaging technologies. GCP Applied Technologies Inc. is headquartered Cambridge, Massachusetts.Most Recent QuarterDespite GCP missing the most recent quarter, the stock jumped more than 25% in the session following the release.The company reported EPS of $0.29 when $0.30 was expected. The 1 cent miss translates into a -3.3% negative earnings surprise. Revenues came in $5M under expectations for a 1.3% negative revenue surprise.Division Being SoldAt the same time of the earnings release, the company noted that they entered into an agreement to sell their Darex Packaging Technologies business to $1.05B to Henkel. The transaction is expected to close in the middle of 2017.The sale of the business likely means that estimates will be chopped. The question is will the stock see a similar move when investors realize that while GCP may be flush with cash the entire company is trading at a value of just over $2.3B at about $33 per share.Additional content:Twitter Bot Scandal Puts Further Pressure on CEO     DorseyJack Dorsey, CEO of Twitter Inc.(NYSE:TWTR-Free Report)is facing another problem in convincing advertisers to return to Twitter, as new research showed that up to 15% of Twitter's 319 million users can be bots rather than human.The research was conducted by University of Southern California and Indiana University. Researchers used more than 1,000 features to identify bot accounts on Twitter. It was estimated that between 9% and 15% of active Twitter accounts are bots.The estimate of 15% is almost twice of Twitter's own estimates. In Twitter's Q4 earnings, the company reported up to 8.5% of accounts could be bots.Twitter is hit particularly hard by this research because the company is already struggling to persuade advertisers to come back. Dorsey, one of the site's co-founders, came back in 2015 as chief executive and hopes to turn around the company's fortune; however, little progress has been made.The company is still far away from making its first profit and stale user growth.The loss from operation of fourth quarter was $143 million, compared to $67 million during the same time last year. Twitter also reported just 4% growth to 319 million monthly active users year-over-year.The company's performance and the bot scandal puts further pressure on Dorsey to step down as Twitter's CEO.A Twitter spokesperson recognized that bot accounts often have negative connation but can be extremely beneficial, like those that automatically alert people of natural disasters or from customer service points of view.While the researchers agreed on the benefits of the bot accounts, they also pointed out, ""there is a growing record of malicious applications of social bots. Some emulate human behavior to manufacture fake grassroots political support… and promote terrorist propaganda and recruitment.""This is a problem that not only Twitter is having but all social media platforms, as Google's(NASDAQ:GOOGL-Free Report)YouTube is currently suffering from ads placement issues with its advertisers.Twitter closed the day at $15.09 per share, up 0.07%.Zacks' 2017 IPO Watch ListBefore looking into the stocks mentioned above, you may want to get a head start on potential tech IPOs that are popping up on Zacks' radar.

Irrational Demands: Of Anchors, Pearls, and Procrastination;3/22/2017;"(0:20) - Dan Ariely: Predictably Irrational(4:10) - Do first impressions get imprinted on us?(6:30) - Arbitrary Coherence: Why do we accept anchors?(12:00) - Are price tags anchors?(14:30) - Dan Ariely: Payoff(16:40) - What gets scheduled, gets done.Welcome back to Mind Over Money. I'm Kevin Cook, your field guide and story teller for the fascinating arena of Behavioral Economics.Today we're going to focus on the work of Dan Ariely, author ofPredictably Irrational. When he published the book in 2008, Ariely was a professor of Behavioral Economics at MIT. Now, he's Professor of Psychology and Behavioral Economics at Duke University and he also is the founder of The Center for Advanced Hindsight. Ariely's TEDtalks have been watched over 7.8 million times.We've talked before about the cognitive bias calledanchoring. Ariely has picked up where the forefathers of Behavioral Economics like Daniel Kahneman and Richard Thaler left off by doing new experiments to find out how prevalent this bias really is.In the podcast, I read from Chapter 2 of Predictably Irrational, titled ""The Fallacy of Supply and Demand: Why the Price of Pearls - and Everything Else - Is Up in the Air.""Ariely begins with a story about the ""pearl king"" Salvador Assael who achieved a remarkable marketing feat in the 1970s New York luxury jewelry scene by making so-called black pearls from Tahiti into a nearly precious gem.He tells this story to help explain the power ofprice anchorsin decision making, especially when the initial price reference is completely arbitrary, and thus, irrational.Then he describes an experiment he conducted with colleagues at MIT in the first decade of the 21st century. The researchers used a class of 55 marketing MBA students to conduct a specialized auction where the participants were first asked to write down the last two digits of their social security numbers.The act of writing down those digits had a surprising overall impact on the results of the auction, which included fine wines, computer equipment, and chocolate. Listen to the podcast and hear me read an excerpt from Dan's book that I hope inspires you to read it yourself.The GAF EconomyAriely's experiments with price anchors and buying decisions got me thinking about my favorite ""big brothers"" and hoarders of tons of data on consumer buying behavior:Alphabet(GOOGL),Amazon(AMZN), andFacebook(FB).I bet Ariely would love to have access to these databases for virtually unlimited testing. Note to self: see if Dan is looking for research partners in this ocean of data.Followers of my stock research and trading articles know that I often talk about The GAF Economy comprised of Google, Amazon, and Facebook. My focus is on the behemoths who have changed our entertainment, education, shopping and entrepreneurship with a digital deluge of information and marketing opportunities.Together, Google and Facebook will break the $100 billion mark this year in advertising revenues according to market research firm eMarketer. Google broke the $50 billion mark a few years ago and Facebook topped $26 billion in 2016.Their combined 2017 haul will command over a 46% share of advertisers' total global digital ad spend. Just think about the volume of consumer purchases triggered by that $100 billion in ad spend.And if you have been listening to me about digital advertising growth in the past year, you know that Facebook is not stealing market share from Google in that growth. Together, they are expanding the pie as tons of small and medium-sized businesses realize the power of digitally-targeting audiences and geographies, efficient ads testing, and fine-tuning of their ad budgets.Welcome to the JungleAnd in the ""retail rainforest"" that is Amazon, consumers continue to adopt its convenient platform for more purchases -- at the expense of traditional retailers. Amazon's total annual revenues grew 27% last year to $136 billion as it was responsible for possibly one-fourth of all online transactions in the US.Testifying to that reach, according to web marketing services provider BloomReach, 55% of consumers started their product searches on Amazon in 2016, up from 44% in 2015.And here are some amazing stats from Amazon's Q4 report...Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) delivered more than two billion units on behalf of sellers in 2016, and the number of active sellers using FBA grew more than 70%. Using the FBA service, Amazon sellers from more than 130 countries fulfilled orders to customers in 185 countries.In 2016, there were over 100,000 sellers with sales of more than $100,000 selling on Amazon.To help put Amazon's share of retail sales in some perspective - I say ""some"" because the company doesn't break out their revenues clearly enough for us to know for sure -- let me share some paragraphs from an October USA Today article titledAmazon could be a lot bigger than we think...In the United States, total annual retail sales are about $5   trillion, with the Department of Commerce estimating 8% of that   is e-commerce. That puts total online sales at around $400   billion, and Amazon's share at 15% (for domestic revenues   only).Amazon's retail revenue, however, doesn't reflect the full   value of the items sold on Amazon by other retailers. These are   companies that use Amazon as an online sales venue, sometimes   their only one. Amazon says 49% of its units sold come from   third-party sellers.The company may actually be handling double that amount - 20%   to 30% of all U.S. retail goods sold online - thanks to the   volume of sales it transacts for third parties on its website and   app. Only a portion of those sales add to its revenue.""The punchline is that Amazon's twice as big as people give   them credit for, because there's this iceberg under the surface,   but you only see the tip,"" said Scot Wingo, executive chairman of   Channel Advisor, an e-commerce software company that works with   thousands of online sellers.When third-party sales are taken into account, Amazon's share   of what U.S. shoppers spend online could be as high as $125   billion yearly, and it could represent close to 30% of the online   goods Americans buy, according to an analysis of Amazon's   financial statements.Gene Munster, a senior analyst at Piper Jaffray, estimates   Amazon touches 30% of total e-commerce in the United States, and   its share is growing.""Amazon's just going to slowly grab more and more of your   wallet,"" he said.Again, Dan Ariely if you are listening, we need to study the buying data and behavior of the GAF Economy. There must thousands of A/B split tests just sitting there waiting with evidence of how predictably irrational we are.A Surprisingly Simple Solution for   ProcrastinationFinally, at the end of my podcast I introduce Ariely's latest book,Payoff: The Hidden Logic That Shapes Our Motivations. I share a productivity secret from Dan that could literally change your life. It's a real golden nugget that will help you control, if not crush, procrastination. Or should I call it a black pearl?Make the time to read Ariely's book. If you liked Freakonomics for the way it gave you new perspectives about society and human behavior via statistics, you'll lovePredictably Irrationalfor its ability to go inside our decision making.And be sure to listen to the podcast for that ""productivity pearl."" It'll have you finishing your own book this year.Disclosure: I own shares of Facebook for the Zacks TAZR Trader.Kevin Cook is a Senior Stock Strategist forZacks Investment   Research.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

AMD's (AMD) Success Is Not The Death Of Intel (INTC);3/22/2017;"My article on Tuesday, which highlighted (some might say “boasted”) the recent achievements of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), was perceived by some readers as an attack on Intel (INTC). But that was the intent.While I’m admittedly an unabashed cheerleader of Intel, I can still appreciate the rags-to-riches story that AMD CEO Lisa Su has successfully executed since her appointment in January 2012. AMD stock traded at $5.40 at the time. The stock recently made a 52-week high of $15.55. Save for the people at AMD headquarters, no one anticipated this remarkable turnaround. But what’s good for AMD is also good for Intel since a excitement surrounding chip battles increases consumer interest.Notably, this renewed battle comes even as the rate of PC revenue continues to decline. In other words, both companies, which struggled at the height of the mobile era, have moved beyond being just PC shops. And while AMD continues to make impressive leaps, Intel is still the leader. The extent to which AMD pushes Intel to innovate, the better off Intel will be. And that’s exactly what Intel CEO Brian Krzanich has begun to demonstrate.makeArticleAd();Looking to avoid the another mobile-type miss, Intel is pushing heavily to be future-ready. Fresh off its second mega-deal in less than two years, Krzanich — in his fifth year at the helm — seems intent on putting Intel’s cash to use. The company’s$15.3 billion acquisitionof Israeli self-driving technology company Mobileye (MBLY) was the most recent example. This follows $16.7 billion deal for Altera back in 2015.These two deals suggest that Intel is not worried about what AMD is doing. It can be argued that it should. But Krzanich, who has found ways to get Intel’s top line growing again, has shown to have a good pulse on what the company needs. Not only does Intel, thanks to Altera, now have an inside track on the Internet of Things and data center market, Mobileye now puts Intel in the driver's seat in the realm of autonomous cars, allowing it to better compete with Tesla (TSLA) and Google (GOOGL).In both acquisitions, however, market pundits, who were unable to immediately see the financial benefits, criticize Intel for overpaying. But, recall, Google was laughed at for buying YouTube in 2006 for $1.65 billion. Today YouTube is worth anestimated $40 billiontoday. Likewise, Facebook (FB) was criticized for taking out Instagram. But assuming Intel can realize the estimated $70 billion total addressable market of driverless cars by 2030, Mobileye could prove to be a bargain.In short, AMD’s improvements don’t spell the doom of Intel. The management of both companies are executing on their stated operating objectives. And both stocks should perform well in the next 12 to 18 months. As to which stock is right for you? That all depends on where your allegiance is."
As AAPL Stock Hits All-Time High, Apple Launches Red iPhone, New iPad;3/21/2017;"Apple Inc.AAPLopened the day at an all-time high at $142.15 per share with the release of a new color of the iPhone 7, new video app, and new iPad.New ProductsThe first product is a special edition Red iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, from the partnership with the Red project to raise funds to fight AIDS. Apple has previously released other products in support of Red, but this is the first time that the company is pairing Red with its most popular item. Apple recorded 78.3 million iPhones sold in the first quarter of 2017.The special new iPhone will be available in stores and online starting Friday for a limited time. Apple didn't specify on the timeframe for the Red iPhone and what percentage of the sales will be donated.Apple also announced a new video app, called Clips. It lets users create a montage of videos, photos, and music with filters, emoji, text, animated titles and narration to be saved to users' phone or shared directly to Facebook Inc.FB, Instagram, Snap's SnapchatSNAP, Alphabet's YouTubeGOOGLand TwitterTWTR.Usually, the third product that was released today has a spotlight for itself in Apple's events, but the market proved otherwise.The tech company updated its most popular-sized iPad with a brighter 9.7-inch display, faster processors, stronger battery performance and a $70 slash in price. Instead of the typical exciting products announcement, Apple introduced their latest iPad with apress release.It may sound like a surprise to many, but the company's latest quarterly report showed that iPad sales had dropped for 12 straight quarters, according toCNET.Despite the declining sales, Apple still leads in the tablet market, though it is a shrinking market. According toInternational Data Corporation, global shipment for tablets dropped 14.7% year-over-year to 43 million shipped in the third quarter 2016.Apple's quiet announcement of the new iPad further proves the declining needs of tablets in the market. Initially, tablets were the replacement for desktops and laptops. Today, larger screen smartphones, phablets, and detachable laptops are replacing tablets. While Apple and Samsung Electronic Co.SSNLFare still dominating the market and coming out with new products, the tablet is losing its charm.Stock RecordIt wasn't the release of new products that raised Apple's stock today but the continued anticipation of the new iPhone that brought up the price. With a series of positive analysts reports this week, Bernstein Research analyst Toni Sacconganhi raised Apple's price target to $160 from $140.Sacconganhi isn't the only analyst that raised the price target. Timothy Arcuri from Cowen & Co.COWNalso raised his price target to $155 from $135. Investors are betting on the new features of iPhone 8 to attract sales. Zacks sees seven positive estimate revisions for the current year in the last 60 days and six negative revisions.After opening at an all-time high, Apple closed the day at $139.84 per share with a 1.15% drop.Apple holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric   Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.makeArticleAd();With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Tech Roundup: Intel Buys Mobileye, Pandora Launches Premium;3/21/2017;"The top news from last week was IntelINTCbuying Mobileye for $15 billion, but Pandora'sPPremium tier, Nintendo's success with the Switch and other news also made headlines.Here are the top stories from last week:Intel Buys MobileyeIntel paid $15 billion for Mobileye that some analysts thought was a huge price tag, especially since it generates revenue of around $350 million only and Intel was anyway already in collaboration with the autonomous technology provider. But given its strong relationships with automakers and design win pipeline, the possibility for deeper collaboration, lower cost of development and other cost synergies as a result of the acquisition, it may be just what Intel needed to battle the rapidly growing competition.Also, Mobileye's maps and data are of strategic value, not only because they are important building blocks of self-driving technology, but also because they will increase the value of Intel's solutions.Pandora Launches On-Demand Music ServicePandora has launched its long-awaited on-demand music streaming service called Pandora Premium for $9.99 a month, similar to other services like Spotify and Apple Music.The company's has a tiered service, starting with Pandora, an ad-supported free radio service that allows you to create ""stations"" based on your preferred artists, songs on genres with Pandora curating the playlist. This is followed by the $5 a month Pandora Plus, which is ad-free, but has limited freedoms in the form of track replay, offline listening (3 most-played stations), etc.Pandora Premium offers all this plus the ability to search and play songs on-demand, no timeouts, fully customizable playlists and more offline listening options. What's more, it comes with an Rdio-like streaming interface that was popular with customers until that company was acquired by Pandora.Pandora has 20 million customers, significantly higher than both Spotify and Apple Music, but while those services are growing strongly, Pandora isn't doing as well, resulting in growing losses year upon year. The just-launched Premium service may not be a runaway success because those looking for such a service have most likely shifted to one of the other services. So if Pandora is to get back in the game, it has to differentiate, or find a way to lure new users the way Apple did. Human curation and artificial intelligence to improve discovery could do the trick, so Pandora is going that route. But will it succeed? We'll have to wait and see.Nintendo's Switch Is on a RollAt launch, Nintendo expected to sell 2 million units of its new Switch game console in the first month. IDC analyst Lewis Ward estimated 8 million units in the first year. But fresh reports from the WSJ, which talked to people with knowledge of the matter, say that in its new fiscal year starting in April, its assemblers are planning to manufacture 16 million more units.The strength in demand across Europe (in a seasonally weak period), the Americas and Japan stems from record sales ofThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wildand the new features.The WSJ says that this likely means that the company will sell around 10 million units, arousing the interest of game developers to produce more games for the device. Nintendo officials have also said that the console may in the future stream content from Netflix, Hulu, Amazon and the like although gaming is the focal point for now. This is really good news for the console maker, which had a failed product in the Wii U (the earlier generation console that launched in 2012).The $300 Switch manages a tabletop mode while also doubling as a portable handheld (for around six hours at a time anyway) and including a docking station for using the TV screen. The table top version allows you to detach the Joy Con controllers so two can play a game. The goal for the Kyoto-based company is to reach the largest number of gamers whether they are serious, casual or just starting out. In this respect, it may be slightly limited because it supports fewer games than the competing XB1 and PS4 although it's still a larger spread than the Wii U.JP Morgan analyst Haruka More says: ""We expect acceleration in its sales momentum toward end-2017 driven bySplatoon 2, scheduled launching this summer.""Other storiesCorporateApple R&D Centers in China: In addition to Beijing and Shenzhen, AppleAAPLhas said that it will now open two more R&D centers in Shanghai and Suzhou, in line with its China R&D investment target of 3.5 billion yuan ($507.1 million). Apple is on slippery ground in China as the battle with local players is full on and the U.S. government's China policies can increase its problems with the Chinese government.LinkedIn Founder Reid Hoffman Joins Microsoft Board: Co-founder, ex-CEO and ex-executive chairman of LinkedIn Reid Hoffman is joining Microsoft's (MSFT) board three months after its acquisition by the Windows maker. His role in the position, as defined by Hoffman himself is: ""continue to focus on helping LinkedIn fulfill its mission of increasing the economic productivity of individual professionals and the companies they work for… I'll also contribute more broadly as Microsoft deepens its presence in Silicon Valley and continues to weave social, AI, and other technologies into [its] products.""Google-Facebook Data Highway: The highest-capacity internet link between Asia and the U.S. is about to be constructed by Chinese real estate magnate Wei Junkang's Pacific Light Data Communication Co (60% share), FacebookFB(20%) and Google (20%). American contractor TE SubCom will lay the 17-millimeter wide, 12,800-kilometer-long cable, which will in all probability be operational by late 2018.Legal/RegulatoryGoogle, Facebook Battle Hate Speech in Europe: In AlphabetGOOGL-owned Google's case, the problem was in the UK, where government ads didn't appear in a desired way. According to the government, ""Google is responsible for ensuring the high standards applied to government advertising are adhered to and that adverts do not appear alongside inappropriate content… We have placed a temporary restriction on our YouTube advertising pending reassurances from Google that government messages can be delivered in a safe and appropriate way.""In Germany, the government praised Google's YouTube for deleting 90% of flagged illegal content, while pulling up social networks like Facebook because ""Too little illegal content is deleted, it's not deleted quickly enough and it looks like the operators of social networks aren't taking their users seriously enough."" Under the draft proposal of new legislation being framed, the government promised fines of up to 50 million euros ($53 million) for failing to give users the option to complain about hate speech and fake news or refusing to remove illegal contentPakistan Wants Tech Help on Blasphemy: Pakistan wants to crack down on Pakistanis living in Pakistan or abroad who have shared material deemed blasphemous against Islam or the Prophet Muhammad. Facebook has said, ""We disclose information about accounts solely in accordance with our terms of service and applicable law. A Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty or other formal request may be required for international requests, and we include these in our Government Requests Report."" Twitter has yet to respond.Tech Companies Support Google's Fight with FBI: Apple, Cisco, Amazon and Microsoft filed a friend-of-the-court brief supporting Google in a case where it is seeking to overturn the order of a lower court to turn over to the FBI certain data stored on servers in other countries. They said, ""So bold a projection of U.S. law enforcement power into foreign countries would show disdain for their sovereignty and threaten to disrupt the harmony existing between the United States and other nations."" There is a precedent in this case: Microsoft won a similar case against the FBI, which wanted to see emails of a foreign national stored on an Irish server.Alphabet Adds to Case Against Uber: Alphabet's Waymo just added a fourth patent that it says was infringed upon by Uber and furnished further details including the statement of an eye-witness in a new filing on Friday. The statement is from Pierre-Yves Droz, a former colleague and close confidant of Levandowski's (the ex-Googler who has allegedly run off with Waymo self-driving technology and trade secrets to form self-driving trucking company Otto, which was subsequently bought by Uber for $680 million).The lawsuit specifies the time at which Levandowski met Uber executives in Jan 2016, registering the company that would become Otto the following day. Waymo is now seeking an injunction to prevent Uber from using the technology in its self-driving vehicles and seeking damages for any proven infringements.New Technology/ProductsMicrosoft Teams: Since its official preview in November last year, Microsoft has added more than 100 new features to the group communication and collaboration service, including things like scheduling capabilities; mobile audio calling, with video calling on Android now and coming soon to iOS and Windows Phone; email integration; and new security and compliance capabilities.Last week, the company rolled out Teams as part of Office 365 across 181 markets and in 19 languages. It's also said that more than 50K organizations have started using Microsoft Teams, including Alaska Airlines, Cerner Corporation, ConocoPhillips, Deloitte, Expedia, J.B. Hunt, J. Walter Thompson, Hendrick Motorsports, Sage, Trek Bicycle and Three UK.Google Voice Ads Test: ""By the way, Disney's live action Beauty and the Beast opens today,"" the Google Home smart speaker told people after giving them the time, weather and travel update as part of its ""My Day"" feature. Google said it wasn't an ad but speculation is running rife as everyone tries to figure out Google's monetization strategy for Home. ""We're continuing to experiment with new ways to surface unique content for users and we could have done better in this case,"" Google said by way of explanation.Google Tries ""Offensive"": Similar to Facebook's ""disputed"" tag, Google has decided to create groups called review teams to flag content they deem ""upsetting-offensive."" Some of the criteria Google's using to flag content would make you smile: ""high-quality"" pages could be the home page of a newspaper that has ""won seven Pulitzer Prize awards,"" and ""low-quality"" pages could be articles that include ""many grammar and punctuation errors."" Thankfully, the results will still show up, but with the flag.Google Payments Through Gmail: Google is extending the peer-to-peer payments service for Gmail users to the Gmail app for Android. Clicking on the attachments tab will now also throw up options to send or receive money with the funds then being transferred from one bank account to the other. The service will be directly pitted against PayPal's Venmo (although without its social aspect) and SquareCash.M&A and CollaborationsSky, Cisco Combine for OnPrime TV: The two have developed a new innovative app-based streaming service called OnPrime TV that will allow consumers in the UK, Italy and Germany to access popular foreign language film, television and news channels in one place. The app can be downloaded via the app store on Apple TV4 and is coming to other devices and other European countries soon. All channel packs offer a 30-day free trial, and range in price from £8.99 to £17.99 a month.Alibaba-Govt of Denmark: Alibaba GroupBABAExecutive Vice-Chairman Joseph Tsai and Danish Minister of Foreign Affairs Anders Samuelsen witnessed the signing of a memorandum of understanding (MoU) that will increase exports from Denmark to China and see the Chinese company promote Denmark as a tourist destination for Chinese travelers. Alibaba's reach (440 million annual active buyers) makes it an attractive platform for foreign advertisers and sellers even through it isn't perfect in terms of curbing counterfeits.Alibaba's Tmall Global has developed country pavilions to familiarize Chinese customers with a true essence of the country in question and help them identify authenticity. The Danish pavilion will have more than 20 brands selling high-quality Danish products in the fashion, lifestyle, home and food categories for starters.Twitter Inks Deal with National Lacrosse League: Twitter has signed a two-year deal that will see it broadcast one game a week with the National Lacrosse League (NLL). Twitter will also live stream the NLL's playoffs and show highlights. The games will also be aired on NLL's video subscription service called NLLTV.com. This isn't of course in the same league as the NFL, NHL, professional boxing and eSports that Twitter dealt with earlier, but it's evidence that the deals continue to trickle in. But the NLL doesn't have a broadcast TV partner, so this is a big deal from its perspective.NVIDIA Self-Driving Partnerships: At the ConnectedWorld event in Berlin, Germany, NVIDIA announced a couple of autonomous driving partnerships with the world's largest auto parts supplier Bosch and popular trucking company PACCAR. The companies will be using NVIDIA's artificial intelligence-powered Drive PX AI technology to develop self-driving cars and trucks.Google-Levi's: Google's Project Jaquard, which combines thin, metallic alloys with natural and synthetic yarns to create touch-sensitive interactive fabrics is finally inside smart jackets from Levi's. The jackets, which will allow you to skip songs, use Google maps and make phone calls by the brush of your sleeve, will sell for $350 from this fall.Some NumbersAmazon Cash Rewards: Alexa has been steadily adding ""skills"" or apps that make it more useful for developers and from last week, owners can ask it to deliver one of the three recently-ordered meals from GrubHub. They just have to say something like, ""Alexa, tell GrubHub I'm hungry"", to which Alexa will respond with the options to choose from. Also from last week, Alexa can get iRobot's Roomba robot to start cleaning your house and give you detailed reports about the job done, time taken etc.So to add to the fun, Amazon decided to make it easier for developers to do more with Alexa by giving them cash rewards. They get a $100 AWS promotional credit and an additional $100 per month in AWS credits if they incur usage charges for their skill. So Amazon basically takes care of app development and hosting until they've made enough themselves to be happy.Google, Facebook Lead in Digital Ads: According to eMarketer's latest forecast, U.S. digital ad spending will increase 16% this year to $83 billion with Google and Facebook claiming the largest share by virtue of their strength in search and display, respectively. Google's overall share of digital ad spending will be 40.7% this year while Facebook's will be over 19%.Facebook is expected to continue growing much faster than Google off a smaller base. Google will dominate in search with a 78% share and Facebook in display with a 39% share. Twitter, which derives 89% of its total ad revenue from mobile, will for the first time see mobile ad revenue shrink, by 5%. Snapchat, which commands just 1.2% of the total U.S. mobile ad market, and just 4% of the total growth in U.S. digital advertising, will grow its ad revenue by 158% to $770 million.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric   Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

1 Great Tech Stock for Wary Retirees;3/21/2017;"Many retirees shy away from tech companies -- to their own   detriment. Maybe it's due to fear of a sector that, as a whole,   is often considered to be higher risk than other, less dynamic   industries. But there are a select few companies that, thanks to   their dominant competitive advantages, offer an excellent   low-risk way for investors to profit from emerging technologies.   Read on to learn about one of the best.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();All hail the kingFew businesses are as dominant within their respective   industries asAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) . The parent company of Google   gives investors an opportunity beyond a core Internet search   business that legendary investor Charlie Munger once described as   havingthe largest competitive moathe's ever seen.With a more than 90% share of the global search engine market,   Google is the undisputed king of search. Yet it refuses to grow   complacent; it's constantly expanding its reach with an   ever-growing array of services. It now possesses an incredible   collection of platforms that serve more than 1billionusers each, including YouTube, Android, Chrome, Gmail, Maps,   Google Play, and nowGoogle Cloud. Together, they serve to expand and strengthen Google's powerful   ecosystem and widen its competitive moat.Moreover, Google generates enormous amounts of cash, to the   tune of nearly $26 billion in 2016, which it has used to build a   fortress-like balance sheet with more than $86 billion in cash   and less than $4 billion in debt. This financial strength allows   it to invest aggressively in research and development, and in the   acquisition of companies that are leading the way in important   new technologies. All of this, combined with Google's renowned   culture of innovation, helps it remain at the forefront of   technological change.Image source: Getty Images.Other betsIt's this innovation that necessitated its reorganization into   its current ""Alphabet"" structure. The design is brilliant, as it sends a clear message   about what the company has become: a collection of businesses   with investments in a far-ranging array of exciting technologies   that are poised to pay increasing returns to shareholders in the   years ahead.Alphabet's holding company structure allows disparate   businesses -- such as self-driving technology leaderWaymo, life sciences companyVerily, and connected home device makerNest-- to be run and scaled independently. Management believes this   will give these ""other bets"" their best chance at receiving the   resources and attention they need to succeed over the long   term.Alphabet therefore gives investors many ways to win. The   company's core Google business is as dominant as they come, which   helps to lower Alphabet's overall risk profile. And the company's   other bets have in many ways become analogous to an emerging   technology fund overseen by two of the greatest minds on the   planet: co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin. It's the perfect   balance of market dominance and optionality; cash flow and   reinvestment opportunity; current success and future growth   potential.ValuationAt first glance, Alphabet's forward price-to-earnings ratio in   the low 20's may seem a bit expensive compared to the   S&P 500's forward P/E of about 18. But if you adjust for the   more than $82 billion in net cash it has on its balance sheet --   which equates to about $119 per share -- Alphabet's ex-cash P/E   drops to less than 19. On that basis, Alphabet's stock is quite a   bargain, especially considering its superior growth rates   compared to the market as a whole.Moreover, investors who buy shares today will be buying   alongside Alphabet itself. The company has a $7 billion share   repurchase program currently under way -- a figure that's likely   tocontinue to growalong with Alphabet's ever rising cash flows. These share   buybacks should further help to support Alphabet's stock price,   and they signal management's increasing willingness to return   capital to shareholders.All told, Alphabet offers retirees an excellent and relatively   low-risk way to profit from emerging technologies -- a high   potential field that's often underrepresented in retirement   portfolios.10 stocks we like better than Alphabet (A     shares)When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Movado Group, Inc.'s Earnings Sink as Retailers Struggle;3/21/2017;"Movado Group(NYSE: MOV) reported fiscal 2017 fourth-quarter earnings on March   20. In the face of falling sales and profits, the luxury   watchmaker is attempting to adapt its business to the rapid   growth of e-commerce.Movado Group results: The raw numbersMetricQ4 2017makeArticleAd();Q4 2016Year-Over-Year ChangeSales$130.785 million$143.264 million(8.7%)Net income$5.232 million$7.888 million(33.7%)Earnings per share$0.22$0.34(35.3%)Data source: Movado Group Q4 2017 earningspress release.Image source: Movado.What happened with Movado Group this quarter?Net sales fell 8.7% year over year to $130.8 million, and   7.5% on a constant dollar basis, as Movado continues to be   negatively impacted by the struggles of department stores and   other traditional retailers. ""We are seeing a significant   shift from brick and mortar to e-commerce and a continuing   challenged fashion watch market in the United States,"" said   Chairman and CEO Efraim Grinberg in a press release.Gross profit declined 14% to $64.7 million, with gross margin   falling to 49.5% compared to 52.6% in the fourth quarter of   2016. Lower sales also dented operating income, which   dropped 36% to $7.4 million. All told, net income   tumbled 34% to $5.2 million, and earnings per share   decreased 35% to $0.22.Looking forwardIn response to this challenging retail environment, Movado is   implementing multiple cost-saving initiatives and devoting more   resources to its e-commerce business. ""Given the evolution   of the retail market place, we are consolidating certain   operations and shifting a greater portion of our investment into   the continued development and growth of our digital footprint,   including allocating a larger percentage of our marketing budget   to online venues,"" said Grinberg.""We are fully committed in our investments in digital and are   very pleased with the multiple initiatives underway,"" added   President Ricardo Quintero during a conference call with   analysts. ""Movado.com was our fastest-growing business unit with   double-digit increases and our digital advertising and social   media footprint continues to grow and gain traction.""To further adapt to changing consumer preferences, Movado is   also expanding its lineup of smartwatches by partnering withAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) subsidiary Google. ""While we   believe in the continued growth potential of the traditional   watch category, we are also excited about our recently announced   partnership with Google to launch a new smartwatch   collection, Movado Connect,"" Grinberg said.Still, Movado is reducing its workforce in an attempt to cut   operating costs by $12 million in fiscal 2018 and $15   million annually thereafter. The company expects to record a   pre-tax charge of approximately $7 million to $10 million related   to these initiatives, mostly in the first quarter. ""We are   decisive in our commitment to become a leaner, more agile   organization, rightsized to the current operating environment and   making smart resource allocations against the biggest   opportunities with a focus on delivering sustainable, profitable   growth in the long run,"" Quintero said .In all, Movado's fiscal 2018 full-year outlook includes:Net sales in a range of $515 million to $530     million.Operating income of $50 million to $55 million.Net income of $33 million to $36.3 million, or $1.40     to $1.55 per share.""Looking into fiscal 2018, we continue to believe there are   many opportunities in the watch category,"" added Quintero.   ""Innovation is the lifeline of our business and we are committed   to continuing to lead, with superior watch design in the   traditional watch category as well as in the connected   segment.""10 stocks we like better than Movado GroupWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Why the Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock Comeback Is Just Beginning;3/21/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) has gotten some of its moxie back. Granted, the growth is nowhere near the pace of the glory years of the 1980s and 1990s. But then again, the shareholder returns have been impressive. During the last 5 years, Microsoft stock has logged a gain of nearly 100%. By comparison,International Business Machines Corp.(NYSE:IBM) has a loss of 13% andQualcomm, Inc.(NASDAQ:QCOM) lost about 11%.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockBut it does seem like the opportunity may be mostly gone for Microsoft stock. Let's face it, the valuation is far from cheap.Consider that the price-to-earnings ratio is about 30X and MSFT stock is near an all-time high. Yet, I think there remains more upside. The fact is that Microsoft stock is a great way to play the cloud megatrend, which is likely to see growth for many years.Why MSFT Stock Is a Good BetThis technology has many benefits that are just too critical to ignore, such as the ability for real-time analytics, better integration with other systems and seamless updates. The business model is also fairly predictable, since it is based on ongoing subscriptions.According toAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Cloud Chief Diane Greene, only about5% of the world's data is in the cloud. She thinks that ultimately the market could hit a stunning $1 trillion.7 Small-Cap Tech Stocks on the Cutting EdgeBut there is another important driver: In today's world, just about all companies need a strong digital presence to be successful. Simply put, customers have come to expect that they should go to a site or app - and quickly get what they want.So to provide this service, companies will need to rely on cloud services. And for now, the two main players include MSFT andAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN).But Microsoft stock may be in the best position. The company has a trusted global brand, a massive global infrastructure, a network of millions of developers as well as thousands of partners and a wide assortment of enterprise software products. Oh, and there is a massive customer base that uses productivity apps like Office.Such advantages are extremely tough to replicate.Bottom Line on Microsoft StockBut what's also important for MSFT stock is that the company has essentially gone all-in with its cloud efforts, such as integrating features among its products and engaging in aggressive M&A.For example, the company has acquired MileIQ, Xamarin and SwiftKey to bolster its mobile footprint. And more recently, MSFT has been acquiring companies in the Artificial Intelligence space. Some examples include Genee (AI-powered scheduling) and Maluuba (natural language processing).Chesapeake Energy Corporation (CHK) Stock Is an Absolute Steal Right NowYet the $27 billion purchase for LinkedIn will perhaps be the most significant for Microsoft stock. With the deal, MSFT gets the global leader in professional online networks - there are over467 million members- that should allow for powerful synergies with existing assets. Already, the company has added LinkedIn services with the Dynamics CRM platform.So yes, it should be no surprise that the quarterly reports from MSFT reflect lots of momentum. In the latestquarter, the company's Azure service, which is similar to Amazon Web Services, saw revenues spike by 93%. In fact, the annual run-rate for the total cloud segment is at over $14 billion.It's true that the cloud market is getting increasingly competitive, as seen with the efforts of companies like IBM,Oracle Corporation(NYSE:ORCL) andHewlett Packard Enterprise Co(NYSE:HPE), but they are all really playing catchup and they do not have the breadth of services that MSFT has. In other words, when it comes to playing the cloud, Microsoft stock remains a great option for investors.Tom Taulli runs the InvestorPlace blogIPO Playbookand is the author of various books, includingTaxes 2017: Saving A Bundle.Follow him on Twitter at@ttaulli.

IBM's Prospects Bright on Watson's Increasing Popularity;3/21/2017;"International Business Machines Corporation'sIBMcognitive solution platform, IBM Watson, seems to be on a roll. Recently, the company's artificial intelligence (AI) platform has been adopted by the likes of AT&T Inc.T, Harry & David, Charlotte Russe and Performance Bicycle.Notably, AT&T will integrate its own Internet of Things (IoT) solutions with IBM Watson on the cloud to provide its enterprise customers enhanced analytic insights into industrial IoT data.Also, Harry & David - the leading supplier of gourmet food products and premium class, gift quality fruits - adopted the full suite of Watson Customer Engagement solutions on the IBM Cloud. This should enable the company to let customers zero-in on the perfect gift at the right time.Similarly, Charlotte Russe, a U.S.-based women's clothing retailer adopted Watson Customer Engagement solutions on IBM Cloud to streamline its order fulfillment process, boost profitability as well as ascertain customer satisfaction.These apart, Performance Bicycle and Titan Company Limited, a leading manufacturer of watches and other personal accessories in India adopted the Watson Customer Engagement solutions on the IBM Cloud.Cognitive Solutions Driving Top-line GrowthWe note that, IBM has been moving away from its traditional businesses to newer (read lucrative) business avenues like cloud and data analytics. During the last reported quarter, Cognitive Solutions (solutions software and transaction processing software) revenues grew 1.4% (up 2.2% at constant currency) year over year to $5.30 billion.International Business Machines Corporation Revenue     (TTM)International Business Machines Corporation   Revenue (TTM)|International Business Machines Corporation QuoteIn 2016, IBM's strategic imperatives (cloud, analytics, mobility and security) revenues increased 13% (up 14% at constant currency) year over year. Cloud revenues surged 35% year over year to $13.7 billion.We also note that IBM continues to expand Watson product offerings. During the last quarter, the company introduced new applications like the Watson Data Platform, Watson Discovery Service and trade surveillance for Financial Services. Further, the company added new cognitive capabilities for conversation to Watson.Per the recent IBM Investor Briefing 2017, IBM estimates the market for IBM Watson on Cloud as a decision making support system to be worth nearly $2 trillion by 2025.What Does this Mean for IBM?Per an IDC report, worldwide spending on cognitive systems and artificial intelligence is expected to be over $47 billion by 2020, which is currently growing at a CAGR of 55.1%.Given the huge opportunity the sector has to offer, the company faces stiff competition from major players like MicrosoftMSFT, AlphabetGOOGLand Apple.However, we believe that IBM is well positioned to brave the headwinds due to the ongoing adoption trend for Watson cloud. We believe that the increasing popularity of Watson cloud bodes well for the company in the long run.We note that the growing adoption trend of the Watson platform has helped IBM outperform the S&P 500 in the last one year. While the stock has gained 18.2%, the S&P 500 Index has registered an increased 15.3% in the same period.Zacks RankAt present, IBM carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Google Pixel 2 Revealed in Leak, Game Changer for Alphabet?;3/21/2017;"If rumors are to be believed, Alphabet Inc.'sGOOGLGoogle is already working on Google Pixel 2, its next smartphone offering. The buzz is that the new phone will sport a slimmer body, powerful camera and hardware, and stay ""premium"".Google Pixel was released last October, and has gone on to become one of the most popular and exciting smartphones. The phone is a big hit among media and consumers.Google Pixel comes at a premium price and targets high-end consumers. This puts Google in direct competition with AppleAAPLand Samsung's high end offerings.The flagship fight is already intense among Google Pixel, Samsung Galaxy S7 and iPhone 7. With speculation already building around Galaxy S8 and iPhone 8, it will not come as a surprise if Google rolls out the next generation of its pixel phone.Alphabet's shares appreciated 6.4% over the last six months, from the time Google Pixel was released, compared with the ZacksInternet-Servicesindustry's gain of 3.6%. It would be interesting to see how the new device (if launched) influences share price.Leaks Reveal Notable Design ChangesMultiple sources have revealed that Google is working on Pixel 2, reportedly codenamed ""taimen"". Considering what taimen literally means (a fish weighing over 100 kilogram) and Google's habit of indicating device size through codenames, we can expect a massive phone with at least 6 inches display.Renders surfacing online suggest notable differences between Pixel 2 and its predecessor. It seems that the new phone will feature narrower bezels both on top and bottom, two speaker grilles, indicating a possible inclusion of stereo speakers, separate volume buttons instead of a rocker, a redesigned glass back with chamfered edges, fingerprint sensor and center-aligned camera module.The position of USB Type-C port at the base and 3.5 mm audio jack at the top remains unchanged.Game Changer for Alphabet?First, we have to wait till Google I/O in May and see if there is actually a new Pixel phone in the company's pipeline.In case, the rumors are found to be true, we don't believe that the device will be anything like a game changer for Google.To make the phone as fascinating as a game changer, the company will have to outsmart Apple and Samsung on both the software and hardware fronts at a competitive price, and that's really hard to achieve. However, we expect the device to give tough competition to similar offerings from rivals.Alphabet Inc. PS Ratio (TTM)Alphabet Inc. PS Ratio (TTM)|Alphabet Inc. QuoteNotably, the major challenge that hovered around Google Pixel was its high price. Several reports have suggested that Pixel 2 will have a pocket-friendly companion to help the company broaden its customer base and boost sales. The rumored Pixel 2B will be priced lesser than the main device, sacrificing on some hardware power.We also note that the initial Pixel device has a high performance 12.3 megapixel camera, but it lags the likes of Samsung Galaxy S7 in terms of pure megapixels. It has been rumored that Google with replace this camera in the new device with one that works extremely well in low light.Google is reportedly testing a number of processors, including the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon chips and specialized Intel hardware. So, we can expect the inclusion of a powerful processor as well as more memory and storage. Reports also claim the inclusion of waterproof design for the first time.Wrapping UpIt goes without saying that Google must do something to outsmart its rivals Samsung, Apple and SonySNEin the high range smartphone market. With an increasing focus on innovation, huge cash balance and technological prowess, Google has the flexibility to pursue growth in this area and give tight competition to the others.Currently, Alphabet has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A better-ranked stock is Autohome Inc.ATHM, sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Driverless Tech at South by Southwest 2017;3/21/2017;"South by Southwest (SXSW) is a giant conference where some of the biggest minds in tech gather to talk about their most exciting new ideas.In this clip from Motley Fool'sIndustry Focuspodcast, our Fools on the ground at this year's conference in Austin, Texas, share some of the most interesting presentations they've seen so far about self-driving cars and developments in the state of self-driving car technology -- including a city that already has a fleet of self-driving taxis running on the streets, howAlphabet's Google(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) might cash in on its self-driving project a few years (or decades) down the line, and more.makeArticleAd();A full transcript follows the video.10 stocks we like better than AlphabetWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade,Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has tripled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy right now... and Alphabet wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.Click hereto learn about these picks!*Stock Advisor returns as of February 6, 2017This podcast was recorded on March 16, 2017.Sean O'Reilly:So, while you're down there at South by Southwest, what did you learn about this possible use of the future?Simon Erickson:It's, I think, the natural next step that we're going to have self-driving fleets instead of just self-driving cars. If you're driving to work and leaving your car in a parking garage all day, you're really not getting the benefits of it being able to navigate and drive itself. They're really meant to be used to be driving all day long. And when you do that, you get a higher utilization out of the vehicle, and that really brings the cost of them down. And you have powerful things behind the scenes. You have neural networks, and all the chips that aren't really cheap. This is really the way that these are meant to be used, to be in fleets. Uber andHertzand all the large fleets and self-driving taxis are really aiming to do this. As far as South by Southwest, you were asking some of the things we learned, we found out that about half the world's population is in cities today, and that's going to grow to about two-thirds by 2050. So, we're going to be moving from about 3.5 billion people in cities today to 7 billion within the next 30 years or so. And you can't just keep building out more and more suburbs and highways and parking garages as infrastructure to have this many people moving into the cities. It needs to be a better-designed city. And I think we're going to see self-driving cars play a key role in how cities are actually designing themselves to accommodate for the population boom.O'Reilly:Yeah, I remember another Fool, Armun Asgari, he had that piece back in October,The Race to Autonomy: An Investor's Guide to Self-Driving Cars. It's a bit of a read, but it was awesome. And one of the things that it's common sense that he points out is, the average American family owns 2.2 cars, and it's a $30,000-$50,000 asset that is rapidly depreciating. Wouldn't it be nice to get some use out of that? Wouldn't it be nice if our cities weren't just these monoliths of concrete to park these things that aren't being used 95% of the time? Did you see anything hard or tangible down at the conference there, on this trend?Erickson:There were sessions. It was more academic, as far as what we had seen at South by Southwest. In terms of use cases, though, I think Singapore is one that we can keep an eye on, if you want to see this in action right now. Singapore, of course, is a city that likes to monitor everything. There's no littering there. They're really cracking down on only smoking in certain areas. It's a very oversight city, so, they're really ahead of the curve on monitoring things. Even today, Sean, they have their analog for Uber. It's a company called Grab, who's teamed up with another company called NuTonomy that's already got self-driving cars navigating around the city, picking people up, basically a taxi service that is happening right now. There is an engineer in the passenger seat just for the peace of mind for the riders. But they're planning to have 100 driverless cars within the next year. This is something that's already happening out there -- you can actually get into a car that's navigating itself to the location for you.O'Reilly:Throughout Singapore, yeah. Can I ask what kind of car is it? I know that Uber was testing driverless cars in Pittsburgh, and I believe they were Volvo crossover SUVs or something. Do you know any of that stuff off the top of your head?Erickson:Yeah, it is Volvo for the U.S. for Uber for self-driving cars. There's also a company called Otto for self-driving trucks, which could be for transport.O'Reilly:Wow. I have to go to my local Volvo dealership and see if they have an engineer sitting around that can take me out on one of these things.Erickson:I have a crazy futuristic idea for you, also.O'Reilly:Is this better than the driverless luggage?Erickson:It is. And you knew, when you invited me on the show, being anExplorer, futuristic kind of guy, that I was going to have to throw some ideas like this to you, right?O'Reilly:I'm all ears.Erickson:The economics are such that the average taxi fare, in the U.S., is charging about $3.50 a mile. Pretty expensive. And it's generally accepted that by 2021, when we're expecting autonomous vehicles to really start going mainstream, that the cost of an autonomous car will cost in the neighborhood of $0.30 a mile. Less than a tenth of the cost today. Now, when you get to that kind of price point, Sean, that opens up a lot of options of who is actually paying $0.30 a mile per trip for customers. And the idea would be, this can be subsidized by advertising companies like Google, where you can get into an autonomous car. Yeah. Get in for a free ride. It'll bring you within a 10-mile radius, or whatever the distance would be. It'll cost Google maybe $3 for your trip, at $0.30 a mile. But in exchange, they have your undivided attention that they can serve you ads in the car.O'Reilly:Oh, my gosh. I mean, I would obviously just look at my phone or read a book. But that's awesome.Erickson:Yeah, especially when you consider the numbers that you threw out earlier. The average American is spending a third of their household income every year on these rapidly depreciating assets that we call cars. It doesn't have to be that way when you start getting into the discussion of $0.30 a mile.Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.Simon Ericksonhas no position in any stocks mentioned.Sean O'Reillyhas no position in any stocks mentioned.

New Details Emerge on Apple's Augmented Reality Ambitions;3/20/2017;"We already know thatApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is extremely interested in augmented reality (AR)   thanks to astring of commentsmade by CEO Tim Cook over the past year or so. Given Cook's   statements, it should be obvious that the company is working onsomethingin AR; what's less clear is how Apple plans to create and deliver   AR experiences. Will it be a function of future iPhones? Perhaps   a new hardware product designed specifically for AR? Probably   both.Bloomberg's Mark Gurmannow has new details on the Mac maker's AR ambitions.Tim Cook hopes augmented reality will be Apple's next big     thing. Image source: Apple.makeArticleAd();With our powers combinedUnsurprisingly, Apple has already assembled a team of   experienced hardware and software engineers, while also tapping   ""talented outsiders,"" according to the report. The team includes   engineers who have worked onFacebook's(NASDAQ: FB) Oculus Rift andMicrosoft's HoloLens. Some special effects artists from the movie industry   are supposedly even in the mix. The company has also made a   handful of AR-related acquisitions to accelerate its efforts,   such as the 2015 purchase of AR start-up Metaio or the 2016   acquisition of spatial perception start-up Flyby, among   others.Gurman believes that Apple AR glasses will launch after Apple   attempts to include AR functions into future iPhones. The   challenge will be keeping the form factor thin and light while   being able to deliver compelling experiences. For this reason, AR   glasses may be tethered to the iPhone, which has more processing   power and can transmit data to AR glasses wirelessly. Keeping   costs down will also be important, since the inevitable price   point needs to be justifiable to mainstream consumers.Mike Rockwell, a former executive atDolby, is reportedly in charge of the team. Rockwell reports to   hardware engineering chief Dan Riccio. The report also details   many other members of the team, and a diverse range of   experiences and skill sets that will contribute to Apple's AR   vision.This all comes shortly after IDC recentlypredictedthat while virtual reality (VR) may be the early winner in the   AR/VR race, AR very likely has greater revenue opportunities over   the long term.In other AR newsFacebook may be prioritizing VR with Oculus, but a report   yesterday fromBusiness Insiderdetails some of the social network's other hardware projects   within its Building 8 division. Facebook has been ramping its   hardware efforts, and has no less than four projects that it is   currently pursuing, notably including one that involves cameras   and AR. The company is betting big that the next big computing   revolution will come in the form of VR and/or AR, and being   relatively new on the tech behemoth scene, it is determined to   help shape the technology.Once upon a time,Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) was the poster child for AR with   Google Glass. While Google Glass flopped on the consumer front,NPRreports that Google Glass is still very much in use in industrial   settings. Manufacturing companies are exploring ways to improve   productivity with Google Glass and AR, which allow workers to   access more information more easily while still being able to use   their hands. Workers previously used tablets, but wearable AR   technology delivers many of the same benefits.In the coming years, the AR front is going to get a whole lot   more exciting -- and crowded.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Twitter Bot Scandal Puts Further Pressure On CEO Jack Dorsey;3/20/2017;"Jack Dorsey, CEO of Twitter Inc.TWTR, is facing another problem in convincing advertisers to return to Twitter, as new research showed that up to 15% of Twitter's 319 million users can be bots rather than human.The research was conducted by University of Southern California and Indiana University. Researchers used more than 1,000 features to identify bot accounts on Twitter. It was estimated that between 9% and 15% of active Twitter accounts are bots.The estimate of 15% is almost twice of Twitter's own estimates. In Twitter's Q4 earnings, the company reported up to 8.5% of accounts could be bots.Twitter is hit particularly hard by this research because the company is already struggling to persuade advertisers to come back. Dorsey, one of the site's co-founders, came back in 2015 as chief executive and hopes to turn around the company's fortune; however, little progress has been made.The company is still far away from making its first profit and stale user growth.The loss from operation of fourth quarter was  $143 million, compared to $67 million during the same time last year. Twitter also reported just 4% growth to 319 million monthly active users year-over-year.The company's performance and the bot scandal puts further pressure on Dorsey to step down as Twitter's CEO.A Twitter spokesperson recognized that bot accounts often have negative connation but can be extremely beneficial, like those that automatically alert people of natural disasters or from customer service points of view.While the researchers agreed on the benefits of the bot accounts, they also pointed out, ""there is a growing record of malicious applications of social bots. Some emulate human behavior to manufacture fake grassroots political support… and promote terrorist propaganda and recruitment.""This is a problem that not only Twitter is having but all social media platforms, as Google'sGOOGLYouTube is currently suffering from ads placement issues with its advertisers.Twitter closed the day at $15.09 per share, up 0.07%.Zacks' 2017 IPO Watch ListBefore looking into the stocks mentioned above, you may want to get a head start on potential tech IPOs that are popping up on Zacks' radar.

The search engine giant is as relevant as ever, and its targeted advertising model is a favorite for advertisers and marketing teams.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockNear a yearly high and at a price-to-earnings ratio of around 31 times, the company faces no headwinds. Competition fromFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) is hardly a concern, even after GOOGL's weak Google+ offering.Alphabet's Electronic Money BusinessGoogle's Gmail for the web now allows for sending money from within the Android app. This could threatenPayPal Holdings Inc(NASDAQ:PYPL).For now, though, PayPal need not worry. Google users may not even know about this money-transferring features. PayPal's branding is so solid that it, along with investors, should not expect an erosion in its business. So, Google Wallet, and evenApple Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AAPL) Apple Pay, have too little of the market share in electronic payments at this time.Still, GOOGL's foray in this business is a necessity. It cannot rely entirely on advertising for all of its revenue.7 Dividend Stocks With Yields That Grow Like WeedsDespite Google and Facebook dominating the digital advertising space, Google's reliance on ad clicks is a clear risk. In the fourth quarter, the company faced higher hardware costs, as itinvestedin the new Pixel phone, Daydream View Virtual Reality and Google Home.But the good news is that Google's revenue growth of 22% year-over-year to $26.06 billion allows the company to invest. Investors are hardly worried: the stock bottomed at the $800 per share range on Feb. 1 and has surged over $860 a share.Increasing ad content to grow profit margins brings risks for GOOGL shareholders. Google's search results will worsen if it continues pushing too many paid ads or its own services before it connects the user to the proper search results. Just do a search for a ""car,"" The search results display at least five ads before the useful results show up below them. On the desktop, this is not entirely unusable because the user gets the results on one screen. On mobile, the ads add to scrolling time for the user. The more frustrating the user experience, the more likely users will start abandoning Google.com in favor ofMicrosoft Corporation's(NASDAQ:MSFT) Bing or DuckDuckGo.Growth in MobileGoogle's focus on high-end hardware, notably the Google Pixel phone, ensures the company is at the forefront of mobile. Google Assistant is the key software solution in the hardware. And it lets GOOGL stock continue its development in AI solutions. Microsoft's Cortana and Apple's Siri are the competitors to the Assistant.Pixel is still in the early phases of hardware development. Since Google puts an emphasis on the user experience, future iterations will only offer a better experience. So this will result in users spending more time using Assistant, Google Search, and other Google apps:""In terms of Google Assistant on the Pixel along with how search works, I think definitely it gives us a way to iterate and move faster and make sure it's working better for users. Our thesis is that as we make it easier for users to have Google at their fingertips across what they are doing and including many modes whether they are typing or asking Google a question, we find that it overall benefits.""Source:SA TranscriptTrading GOOGL StockHaving the highest weighting with GOOGL stock may lead to a 3.6% total return in 30 days.3 Ways Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Can Reach $500 and BeyondThis company as the only tech holding in a portfolio is enough to give investors a healthy exposure to the sector.Source:WhoTrades StrategyAlphabet does not have any major headwinds ahead.

Google's Rating Cut Over YouTube Ad Placements;3/20/2017;"Alphabet Inc.GOOGL, the parent company of Google, received a downgrade today to ""Hold"" from ""Buy"" by Pivotal Research analyst Brian Wieser. The reason for the rating cut centered on the placement of YouTube's ads. Some ad buyers had voiced that their ads appeared next to videos carrying homophobic or terroristic videos on YouTube.This has become a large problem for Google in the UK, as many of the largest brands have suspended their advertising on YouTube. Agency holding company HavasHAVSFannounced that it has suspended all advertising on YouTube and Google Display Network for its clients in the U.K. Havas' clients includes the UK Government, L'OrealLRLCY,McDonald'sMCD, and Sainsbury,JSAIY.""We think that the problems which have come to light will have global repercussions as marketers potentially adapt their U.K. policies to other markets and as marketers around the world become more aware of the problem,"" said Wieser in a report.Outside of the U.S., Britain is Google's largest market for advertising revenues. It generated almost 9% of Alphabet's total revenues in 2016.On Friday, Google said that it worked hard on making sure ads don't appear on pages or videos with hate speech, or gory or offensive content but with 400 hours of video uploaded to YouTube every minute, it is very hard to get everything correct.""We have always said Google, Facebook and others are media companies and have the same responsibilities as any other media company. They can't masquerade as technology companies, particularly when they place advertisements,"" said Martin Sorrell, the CEO of WPP Plc.WPPGY, the world's largest advertising firm.Google apologized on Monday for the incidents and made a commitment to simplify advertiser controls, add safer defaults and increase investments to enforce its ad policies faster.Alphabet closed the day with a decrease of $4.46 (0.51%) to $867.91 per share.Zacks' 2017 IPO Watch ListBefore looking into the stocks mentioned above, you may want to get a head start on potential tech IPOs that are popping up on Zacks' radar.

Is Google or Amazon Winning the Home Assistant Market?;3/20/2017;"Of all the recent technological trends, the rise of home assistant products is one of the most intriguing ones. These products are developed to control home devices like home security, lighting and sprinklers, to name a few. Home assistant products also make online shopping an easy task.As these products are fast becoming a part of our homes, the competition too is gradually heating up as to which products can emerge the best home assistants. So far, the two main competitors in this space are Amazon'sAMZNAmazon Echo and Google'sGOOGLGoogle Home.Let's see what Amazon and Google have been doing to maintain their supremacy in the Home Assistant device space and how these devices help the companies in increasing their sales.Amazon Echo DevicesAlways aiming for innovation, Amazon is definitely a frontrunner in the growing Home Assistant market.Not many people could have predicted the popularity of Amazon's Alexa when the product was first announced in 2014.It is a small speaker-like home automation device that can do everything from streaming music to dimming lights or cranking up the heat on the compatible thermostat through voice commands. It is capable of interacting with smart home products, such as the Philips Hue smart light bulbs and smart thermostats from Alphabet-owned Nest.Amazon has been continuously adding new features to its Echo devices. So the growing list of things its devices can do has been keeping Echo in the headlines. The list includes a formidable lineup of compatible smarthome devices that Echo can control.How Will These Echo Devices Increase Sales?It is important to understand the nature of Amazon's core business. It is primarily an online retailer that sells a wide array of products. So, these Echo products play right into Amazon's core retail business. These Amazon's Echo devices help a consumer in making online purchases through voice command, thus saving time and energy.  Also, Alexa can play music from Amazon's paid for subscription service and thereby act as a passive block on using rival shopping sites.These new products from Amazon have the potential to increase sales and garner higher revenues.Coming to the price performance, over the past one year, shares of Amazon outperformed the Zacks categorized Electronic Commerce industry. While the industry gained 53.88%, the stock returned 40.11%.Google's Efforts toward Fight CompetitionGoogle on the other hand, became the second entrant in the Home Assistant space with the launch of Google Home in October last year. Much like Echo, Google Home, also performs an array of tasks such as playing music, reading books, managing calendars, answering queries, searching places, calling over cabs, controlling smart home devices and so on. It runs on Google's new voice assistant.Though it is still unclear how Home will benefit Google, but it will surely help create some competition with Alexa. Moreover, as voice is being seen as the next big thing in computer interaction, these products could help Google expand its revenue going forward.Research company, Gartner, said that, 30% of all interactions with devices will be voice-based by 2018, because people can speak up to four times faster than they can type. Also, the technology behind voice interaction is continuously improving, thus increasing its use in future.However, if will it be accepted by the mass is yet to be seen.Coming to the price performance, over the past one year, shares of Alphabet have been steadily treading higher. The stock returned 14.45% compared with the Zacks categorizedInternet Servicesindustry's gain of 11.46%.Stupendous Growth Expected in This MarketPer the recent report from Gartner, consumer spending on virtual personal assistant-enabled wireless speakers will reach $2.1 billion worldwide in 2020, up from $360 million in 2015.Also, the research firm claimed that by the year 2020, 3.3% of global households are expected to adopt a VPA-enabled wireless speaker. Werner Goertz, an analyst at Gartner, said, ""The widespread adoption and proliferation of VPA speakers could result in a significant number of online shopping orders in the home being initiated from a VPA speaker, rather than a laptop or mobile device.""The strong growth projection for the personal assistant market is a key growth catalyst for Amazon and Google. It looks like these tech companies won't stop until they have full control over everyone's home.As a booming future is being predicted for the home assistant market, Amazon and Google's home assistant devices could quite well add to their top and bottom-line figures going forward.Bottom LineImportantly, the personal assistant space is still in its nascent stage. Therefore companies like Google and Amazon, among others are strong contenders in the new war of capturing consumers' homes.Although both the companies are making continuous efforts toward releasing and upgrading new products in this space, it will be interesting to see which way consumers lean and how sales affect both companies going forward.As technology continues to improve, home assistants could soon become even more commonplace.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, both Amazon and Alphabet carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector include ON Semiconductor CorporationONand Advanced Energy Industries, Inc.AEIS, each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks   here.For the current year, estimates for ON Semiconductor went up 7.8% in the past 60 days, and those for Advanced Energy increased 18.2%.Zacks' 2017 IPO Watch ListBefore looking into the stocks mentioned above, you may want to get a head start on potential tech IPOs that are popping up on Zacks' radar.

Why Alphabet, DryShips, and Sonic Slumped Today;3/20/2017;"Following a strong end to last week as the Federal Reserve   decided to increase interest rates, the stock market was mostly   flat on Monday, with major indexes waffling between positive and   negative territory throughout the day. Still, a few stocks left   investors reeling today, includingAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG)DryShips(NASDAQ: DRYS) , andSonic Corporation(NASDAQ: SONC) . Let's take a closer look at what drove   these declines.Is Google losing its advertising mojo?Shares of Google parent Alphabet fell a modest half percent   after Pivotal Research group analyst Brian Wieser downgraded his   rating on shares to hold from buy, expressing concern that   advertisers are pulling marketing investments from the internet   search titan's platforms over concerns regarding the placement of   their ads. To blame, Pivotal says, was aTimes of Londonreport(may require subscription) last month indicating video ads   from several well-known brands were seen displayed on neo-Nazi   and jihadist websites.Image source: Alphabet.makeArticleAd();In particular, Pivotal notes global advertising company Havas   opted to stop spending on YouTube and Google display ads last   week, while separate reports indicate several industry giants   likeMcDonald's,HSBC, and Audi are all considering similar moves to pull away from   Google advertising.""While Google has apologized for the incidents,"" Wieser added,   ""and while the scale of the underlying problem may be relatively   small in absolute terms, for larger marketers any one instance of   an inappropriate brand placement may be enough to seriously harm   a brand's business value.""DryShips' big offeringNext, shares of dry bulk shipping company DryShips dropped   more than 17% after the company filed for a massive $2 billionmixed shelf offering. The move gives DryShips the flexibility to sell a variety of   its securities to raise money including common shares, preferred   shares debt securities, warrants, purchase contracts, rights, and   units, and provides no specific time table or limit to the number   of offerings it can employ to do so.Dryships has already gone through a staggering transformation   over the past year, from selling ships to pay debt, raising   capital and opening revolving credit facilities to solidify its   balance sheet, and announcing its strategic expansion in the gas   carrier market just over two months ago. But this mixed shelf   offering means more dilution for shareholders is likely coming,   even after the company'squestionable decisionto initiate a fixed $2.5 million quarterly dividend a few weeks   ago.Sonic gives one analyst indigestionFinally, shares of drive-in restaurant chain Sonic fell 3%   after receiving a downgrade to hold from buy at Canaccord   Genuity. Canaccord also reduced its per-share price target on   Sonic to $24 from $30 -- shares currently trade just above $23 --   citing a trend of softer sales lately and longer-term concerns   over increasing competition from ""non-traditional venues"" like   convenience stores.What's more, the analyst firm believes Sonic's recent   discounting will continue, and that its lack of new menu   innovation will do it no favors in today's difficult dining   industry environment. As it stands, investors should receive more   clarity on Sonic's business when the company releases fiscal   second-quarter 2017 results next week. But in the meantime, this   downgrade has pushed Sonic stock to near a fresh 52-week low.Offer from The Motley Fool: The 10 best stocks to buy     nowMotley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more     than a decade beating the market.

Uber's President Quits: Are IPO Plans Toast?;3/20/2017;"Ride-hailing giant Uber Technologies confirmed on Sunday that   its president, Jeff Jones, has resigned.Jones, hired just six months ago, was the second-highest   ranking executive at Uber after CEO and founder Travis Kalanick.   His decision to leave Uber follows the departure of two other   Uber executives in recent weeks, and a growing list of scandals   and challenges that calls into question when -- or whether --   Silicon Valley's most valuable private company will be able to go   public.The challenges facing Uber include an important lawsuit over     its self-driving technology. Image source: Uber     Technologies.makeArticleAd();Two explanations for Jones's departureWhy Jones left depends on who you ask.If you ask Uber, or at least Kalanick, Jones' decision to   depart followed an announcement that Uber has decided to seek a   strong chief operating officer to assist Kalanick in running the   compnay. In a note to Uber staff on Sunday, Kalanick said that   Jones ""came to the tough decision that he doesn't see his future   at Uber"" after the announcement, according to a Recodereport.But if you ask Jones, it was a little more complicated. In a   statement provided to Recode, Jones said, ""It is now clear,   however, that the beliefs and approach to leadership that have   guided my career are inconsistent with what I saw and experienced   at Uber, and I can no longer continue as president of the   ride-sharing business.""Why Jones might have decided to get out nowFor starters, Uber's decision to seek a COO was spurred by an   embarrassing video that showed Kalanick arguing with an Uber   driver over fare reductions that the driver claimed had hurt his   income. It also followed a former Uber employee's serious,credible allegationof a pattern of sexual harassment at the company.Uber has hired two outside law firms to conduct investigations   related to the former employee's claims. One will investigate her   claims specifically, the other is conducting a broader   investigation into Uber's workplace practices.In what may be related developments, two other executives have   departed recently:Uber's senior vice president of engineering, Amit Singhal,     resigned after a reporter from Recodeinformed the companythat Singhal had left a prior job at Google following a     ""credible"" allegation of sexual harassment.Uber's vice president of product and growth, Ed Baker, also     resigned following allegations that he had been seenkissing an Uber employeeat a company event.There's more.The New York Timesreportedearlier this month that Uber has been using a software tool   called ""Greyball"" to deceive authorities in markets where its   service had been pressured by law enforcement or banned.And in perhaps the most dangerous development for the future   of Uber's business,Alphabet's Waymo self-driving subsidiary has sued Uber, claiming that the   head of Uber's self-driving research program, Anthony   Levandowski, took proprietary technology secrets with him when he   left Google in early 2016 to found self-driving truck start-up   Otto, which Uberacquired last summer. Waymo is seeking to halt Uber's self-driving operations. (Uber   has called Waymo's allegations ""baseless,"" but hasn't yet   responded in detail.)Long story short: Uber's growth story could be in serious   trouble.The latest sign that Uber could be in serious troubleTaken together, the recent reports paint a picture of a   company where sexual harassment is tolerated, laws are seen as   inconveniences to be circumvented, and a showcase technology   effort might be based on stolen secrets.That's all bad for obvious reasons, and for one reason that   might be a little less obvious: Like all tech companies, Uber is   in a constant battle to hire and retain top talent. These kinds   of stories hurt.Jones, who had come to Uber fromTargetjust six months ago, apparently decided that he had seen enough.

IBM's Cloud Computing Holds Potential: Should You Buy?;3/20/2017;"International Business Machines Corp'sIBMrecent investor briefing reflected its continuing focus on being a cloud-first company. Notably, cloud revenues grew 35% to $13.7 billion for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock in 2016. You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank   stocks here.makeArticleAd();The annual exit run rate for cloud as-a-service revenue increased 53% on a year-over-year basis to $8.6 billion. Moreover, IBM had more than 50 cloud centers globally and its Bluemix platform was one of the largest open public cloud deployments worldwide at the end of 2016.We note that the impressive growth has helped IBM outperform the S&P 500 in the last one year. While the stock has gained 18.1%, S&P increased 15.3% in the same period.Cloud Computing: Robust Growth ExpectationsWe note that IBM's growth expectations from cloud computing remains positive in the long haul. Management expects market opportunity in enterprise cloud to be greater than $800 billion by 2020. Moreover, the company anticipates more than 85% of enterprises to commit to multi-cloud architectures by 2018, which is positive for its hybrid cloud offerings.As such, the overall growth expectation for the public cloud computing services market is very much bullish. According to Gartner, worldwide public cloud services market is projected to grow 18% over 2016 to $246.8 billion in 2017. Further, the figure will increase to $383.3 billion by 2020.Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) is projected to be the highest growth service driven by improvement in PaaS and massive adoption of artificial intelligence (AI), analytics and the Internet of Things (IoT). IaaS is projected to grow from $25.29 billion in 2016 to $71.55 billion in 2020.IBM Lags Behind in the CloudDespite the impressive growth figures and bullish sentiments, we note that IBM lags behind the likes of AmazonAMZNand MicrosoftMSFTin the public PaaS and IaaS cloud computing markets.According to Synergy Research's latest report Amazon Web Services (AWS) maintained its dominant position in the market followed by Microsoft Azure, Alphabet'sGOOGLGoogle and IBM at the end of fourth-quarter 2016.The research firm noted that these three have gained market share in the last one year at the expense of smaller players as well as strong performance from Microsoft and Google. However, their combined market share of 23% lags a fare bit as compared with Amazon's 40%.We believe that IBM's hybrid approach is yet to find many takers in both the public and private cloud markets. Despite significant investments - first on acquiring SoftLayer for $2 billion and then spending more than $1 billion on data centers - the clientele is not as impressive as Amazon or Microsoft.China: IBM's Savior?Per Gartner, China has become a significant IaaS cloud market. The research firm noted that ""While China's cloud service market is nascent and several years behind the U.S. and European markets, it is expected to maintain high levels of growth as digital transformation becomes more mainstream over the next five years.""IBM is now planning to tap into China's fast- growing cloud computing market through a new company formed in collaboration with Wanda Internet Technology Group. The new company will offer IaaS and Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) to Chinese enterprises and businesses. Reportedly, IBM will have a share in revenues.Moreover, as a part of the deal, the company will launch Watson services to China. IBM is expected to offer Watson Conversation services at the first, which will allow developers to add natural language interactions between applications and client.ConclusionDespite lagging in competition, we believe that IBM is developing a niche for its hybrid cloud services along with ""Strategic Imperatives"" (cognitive computing, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning).IBM Watson on Cloud is a key growth driver in IoT, healthcare and financial services end-markets. IBM Watson is anticipated to reach more than 1 billion people by the end of 2017. Moreover, Blockchain initiatives, Quantum computing, Containers are some of the other catalysts that will support growth trajectory in the long run.Zacks' 2017 IPO Watch ListBefore looking into the stocks mentioned above, you may want to get a head start on potential tech IPOs that are popping up on Zacks' radar.

Alibaba Continues to Diversify, Invests in Gaming Platform;3/20/2017;"Year to date, shares ofAlibaba Group Holding LimitedBABAappreciated 20.3% compared with the Zacks Internet Commerce industry's gain of 18.2%. This outperformance was largely backed by the company's near monopoly in the Chinese e-commerce market and strengthening position beyond it.The company is reportedly investing $145 million (1 billion yuan) in partnerships with some mobile gaming companies to expand mobile game distribution globally.Per CNBC, the Chinese e-commerce giant is putting cash into a number of e-commerce companies to facilitate distribution of games between China and other parts of the world. The report also states that Alibaba will leverage on its big data capacities to suggest game downloads to customers.Eyeing an Attractive IndustryAccording to IDC, China-developed online games grew in double digits, generating $7.2 billion in revenues from overseas in 2016. IDC expects operating revenues of the China gaming market to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12.2% from 2016 to 2020.Revenues from mobile eSports games in China are expected to increase to $7.7 billion by 2020 from $2.5 billion today. China's Virtual Reality (VR) game market size is anticipated grow to $1.5 billion and gaming cloud revenues are likely to touch $525.6 million by 2020.International players are increasingly trying to team up with local Chinese vendors to overcome China's policy issues and bring their games to the market. FacebookFBis trying to team up with Chinese game companies. Last year, Alphabet'sGOOGLGoogle launched a Chinese developers' website to allow local mobile game developers promote their products in international markets. Being a major player in the market, these trends play into Alibaba's sweet spot.Strengthening Position Outside E-commerce and   ChinaInvestment in gaming platform would diversify Alibaba's business as e-commerce growth has slowed down in China. The move can also be a part of Alibaba's bid to strengthen its foothold in the U.S. We will have a clear idea if the report comes out to be true and the company reveals more details about the gaming firms that it is investing in. In 2014, Alibaba invested $120 million in Kabam, a privately held mobile gaming company in the U.S.Alibaba Group Holding Limited Revenue   (Quarterly)Alibaba Group Holding Limited Revenue   (Quarterly)|Alibaba Group Holding Limited QuoteWe note that Alibaba faces tough competition from AmazonAMZNin the U.S. but has successfully prevented Amazon from encroaching into its home turf.The company has been taking other steps to diversify as well. In March, it bought a majority stake in India's Paytm E-Commerce. Apart from buying stakes of e-commerce companies and pushing its AliExpress site in emerging markets, the company is also exploring the offline retail space.In February, the company entered into a strategic partnership with Bailian Group to leverage on its big data capacities and to explore new retail opportunities across outlet design, technology research and development, customer relationship management, supply chain management, payment and logistics.It has also partnered with Intime Retail Group Co Ltd founder, Shen Guojun, in a $2.6 billion bid to privatize Intime and purchased a stake in grocery chain Sanjiang Shopping Club Co Ltd. It has also invested $1.25 billion in a food delivery service in China called Ele.me.We also see Alibaba's growing interest in the global logistics business. The company has been exploring this space with investments in couriers and warehouses in the recent years. It has opened its own logistics service known as Alibaba Logistics.Recently, the company sealed a partnership with Maersk, a unit of Denmark's A.P. Moller-Maersk and the world's biggest container shipping line, to offer online reservation of space on Maersk's vessels. The service eliminates freight forwarders from the booking process and limits their services to haulage.It seems that Alibaba is leaving no stone unturned, in case the online retail industry hits a roadblock.Currently, Alibaba carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Facebook (FB) Looking for a Retail Head to Sell Hardware;3/20/2017;"Facebook IncFBis looking for a GTM Retail Program Manager ""who will have the responsibility of creating disruptive ground up shopping experiences of Facebook consumer hardware"".Per media reports, Facebook is trying to build a strong presence in the hardware products arena which boasts names like Apple IncAAPL, MicrosoftMSFTand AlphabetGOOGL. However, media reports add that Facebook may not be setting up stores but might just be looking to enhance experiences of its retail associates.Facebook is working to boost its hardware efforts. Last year, at its F8 Developer Conference, the company announced Building 8-a DARPA style research facility, spearheaded by Regina Dugan, a former Alphabet executive. Notably, Dugan served as DARPA's director prior to her Alphabet appointment. It had also unveiled Area 404, a 22,000 sq feet sprawling hardware research lab at it Menlo Park headquarters to boost ""modeling, prototyping, and failure analysis in-house."" Last year, it also snapped up startup-Nascent Objects-for an undisclosed amount to step up its hardware efforts.Moreover, media reports add that Facebook at this year's F8 is likely to unveil four consumer hardware products. These include drones, brain scanning technology, augmented reality and next gen cameras. At present, Facebook sells one consumer hardware product, namely, Oculus Rift, a VR headset. The company had acquired the product for $2 billion in 2014. With Oculus, the company is trying to fuel the company's ambitious AR/VR efforts.Facebook, Inc. PriceFacebook, Inc. Price|Facebook, Inc.

Ericsson Wins Media Management Services Contract from BBC;3/20/2017;"Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson(publ)ERICrecently announced that it has inked a multi-year contract with BBC, to offer post-production and media management services to the premium public service broadcaster's in-house creative agency, BBC Creative. Ericsson clinched the contract through a tender process, beating leading post-production companies.BBC Creative witnessed spectacular growth over the past year, producing content on numerous campaigns across the organization. Leveraging on its proprietary cloud-based media processing platform, Ericsson will deliver end-to-end services - including desktop facilities, edit and audio suites, and storage. The company's post-production services facility in London - which is well equipped with multiple craft edit, audio and captioning suites - will take care of the BBC's  content management and delivery needs.Over time, Ericsson has been taking strategic steps to fortify its foothold in the broadcasting and media industry by extending its technology to broadcasters for merging video and mobility. In the past year, the company has entered into multiple contracts - including Liberty Global's operating unit, Liberty Global and Belgian telecommunication player, Proximus - to boost their Digital Video Recording services.Ericsson further partnered with Alphabet Inc.GOOGLto extend the reach of its cloud-based MediaFirst TV Platform into the Android TV ecosystem, Google's operating system for the set-top-box. The company has a proven track record, delivering TV and media business transformation for over two decades. Currently, it distributes 4 million hours of programming in more than 60 languages for over 500 TV channels.Ericsson's share price had a disastrous run on the bourse in 2016, as it plunged 39.3%, far wider than the ZacksWireless Equipmentindustry's average negative return of 7.7%. However, since then, the company has managed to recoup some of those losses, having appreciated 15.2% so far in 2017, in stark contrast to the industry's average decline of 3.0%.We believe the company's restructuring actions, including steps to slash cost of sales, efforts to improve supply chain management and service delivery are helping it boost margins. Going forward, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has plans to prune its TV/Media business to improve profitability. It will be interesting to see whether the company will be able to hold its own position amid tough conditions in the wireless market, which has been on a steady decline.Please note that brokers are on the sidelines for the stock as its earnings estimates remained unchanged over the month. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged at 30 cents over the same time frame.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the same space include Motorola Solutions, Inc.MSIand Ubiquiti Networks, Inc.UBNT. Both stocks hold a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy)   stocks here.Motorola has a striking earnings surprise history for the trailing four quarters, having beaten estimates all through, for an impressive average beat of 16.4%.Ubiquiti Networks managed to beat earnings estimates thrice over the trailing four quarters.

What Is the Internet of Things?;3/18/2017;"Defining the Internet of Things (IoT) can be simplified down   to the connection of everyday things -- like homes, industrial   equipment, watches, etc. -- to the internet, for the purpose of   collecting data, tracking usage, and automating systems. While it   encompasses many technological devices, it's important to   remember that the Internet of Things spans across all major   sectors. The amount of connected IoT objects will reach 50   billion by 2020 and will be worth $7.1 trillion by that same   year.Now that you know a little more about what the IoT is, let's   take a look at how companies are using the IoT right now, and a   few IoT examples you might not know about.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();You've probably already seen the IoT in actionIf you've ever seen anApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Watch or an internet-connectedFitbitfitness tracker, then you're familiar with the Internet of   Things. These devices fall into the broader wearable technology   market and they're what many people think of when they think of   the IoT.Or perhaps you've heard of a Nest programmable thermostat.Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL)  owns Nest, which makes   internet-connected thermostats that you can control via a   smartphone or tablet, and learns your heating and cooling   preferences the more you use it.Both Alphabet andAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) are also pushing the Internet of Things into homes   with their smart home hubs, like Google Home and the Amazon Echo.   Both devices use virtual assistants to answer questions, order   things online, or connect to door locks, lights, and home   security systems. Connected homes are a major part of the   consumer side of the IoT, and will bring in $14 billion in   revenue this year in the U.S.Smartwatches, internet-connected fitness trackers, and smart   home connections are just a few examples of how companies are   investing in the IoT. While there are lots of companies betting   on the Internet of Things, here's a quick list of some of the   biggest players.CompanyIoT FocusMarket CapAppleSmartwatches$729 billionAlphabetSmartwatches, Nest, Android Things, Google Home, Weave         platform, Google Cloud IoT services$590 billionAmazonAlexa-powered devices, AWS IoT$406 billionGeneral Electric(NYSE: GE)Predix software, Asset Performance Management software,         Brilliant Manufacturing software, and IoT security         monitoring$257 billionVerizon Communications(NYSE: VZ)Smart city connections, ThingSpace platform, asset         tracking and management, smart device monitoring, 5G         wireless$201 billionHere's what you might not knowWhile much of the IoT may seem like it's focused on consumer   devices, most of the growth with come from the enterprise market.   Research from BI Intelligence shows that enterprise devices will   account for 40% of all 23.3 billion IoT devices by 2019.Agricultural-equipment makerDeere & Companyusesinternet-connected field equipment, along with sensors, analytics software, and cloud services to   track the efficiency of seed planting. This type of agricultural   technology is transforming how food is grown and how farmers   manage their fields and equipment.Many other non-tech companies are also jumping into the IoT as   well. General Electric, the 125-year-old conglomerate, has   developed its own analytics software for industrial equipment. GE   uses its software to help its customers manage their equipment   more efficiently and anticipate when it needs to be fixed.Scottish and Southern Energyuses GE's Reliability Management software to track its   equipment and maintain uptime, which saves the company an   estimated $3.6 million dollars every year.What the Internet of Things needs to growIn order for more devices, equipment, and services to be added   to the IoT, new and more sophisticated wireless networks are   being developed. Verizon is at the forefront of this change and   said last year that its upcoming 5G network will help address the   IoT's network needs. Verizon will roll out pilot tests of   its 5G network in 11 cities across the U.S. in the first half of   this year.While there's often a lot of hype around new technologies,   it's clear that companies are already taking the IoT seriously   and finding ways to use connected devices and software to offer   better products and services. And if this year is any indicator,   it appears thatnow is one of the best timesfor investors to consider getting on board with this   technological shift.10 stocks we like better than AlphabetWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

This Week in Solar;3/18/2017;"The solar industry had another busy week with a number of   announcements and earnings reports from some of the largest   companies in the business. It was so eventful, in fact, that I   can't cover everything in this week's roundup, but I can hit the   items investors most need be aware of.As the solar industry evolves into a more mature market and   players define where they think they'll have a competitive   advantage, it's time for investors to start looking at where   companies fit into the market and whether they'll have a   profitable future. With that context in mind, here are the   notable news items from the solar industry this week.X-Series solar panels on a residential rooftop. Image     source: SunPower.makeArticleAd();SunPower signs a P-Series supply dealSunPower(NASDAQ: SPWR) has been laying out its plans for the future, and   a central piece of its strategy is based on combining the   P-Series solar panel (which uses commodity cells to create a   slightly higher efficiency ""commodity-plus"" panel) with the Oasis   power plant design. The company is essentially transitioning from   the utility-scale project-building business to supplying   pre-engineered solutions to developers, like utilities. The   strategy makes sense, but we had yet to see much indication that   it was taking hold in the market... until this week.SunPower signed a 125 MW supply agreement withNextEra Energy(NYSE: NEE) to provide its P-Series modules to the developer   between June and October of this year. There wasn't any   disclosure about whether the deal included the Oasis tracking   system or any design services, but even if it's just a panel   supply agreement, it would be a positive sign.If deals like this continue to come through in 2017 and   SunPower is able to supply panels and other services to   developers on short lead times, it would be an immensely positive   development. One deal isn't a confirmation that the   P-Series/Oasis strategy is a success, but it's a step in the   right direction for SunPower shareholders.Google takes Sunroof nationwideAlphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google subsidiary started the   Project Sunroof initiative in 2015 to try to give customers and   installers an easy view of the solar potential of homes around   the country. Initially, the project covered just a few cities,   but the idea was to eventually roll it out nationwide. This week,   that happened.Project Sunroofnow allows people across the country to quickly view an outline   of their home's solar potential, and get an idea of what a solar   system might cost them. Installers can be plugged into the search   to make sales easier, and I would expect some will even use it as   a tool to target sales opportunities. This is one big example of   how solar is becoming a little easier for customers to understand   and see as accessible, particularly outside of traditional solar   hubs such as California and Massachusetts.Trina Solar goes privateIn a deal that has been in the works for months, Trina Solar   was finally taken private this week. The $11.60-per-share offer   made by a group led by the CEO looked to be on shakier ground   late last year as solar panel prices plunged and demand in the   solar market declined, particularly in China.I questioned whether or not the deal would go through given   the questionable history of Chinese buyout offers and the decline   in the market overall. But Trina Solar is now private, and the   fact that the deal went through may mean management sees a   brighter future than many investors currently do.Takeaways from earnings seasonEarnings season is about over for the solar industry, and   afterJA Solar(NASDAQ: JASO) andVivint Solar(NYSE: VSLR)reported this week,there were a few major takeaways from the end of 2016 and early   2017.Chinese solar panel manufacturers are down, but not out.     Gross margins in the fourth quarter were in the low to mid     teens at most manufacturers, and while profitability generally     dropped, they were able to cut costs and remain near breakeven     levels.National residential solar companies are generally in     decline and having a tough time transitioning to a market where     loan and cash sales are the dominant financing option.Sunrunis the one company that has doubled down on leasing, and it's     currently going well for the company. But withSolarCityand Vivint Solar seeing installations decline, there's a lot of     uncertainty about what the residential solar industry will look     like in the future.Technology improvements are coming, and those who stand pat     will eventually get run over. Whether it's First Solar     upgrading from Series 4 to Series 6 solar panels, SunPower     discontinuing most of its mid-level E-Series production in     favor of its high-efficiency X-Series, or the advance of     mono-PERC, efficiency matters more than ever in the solar     industry.That's all for this week in solar. Check back to Fool.com next   week for more about the biggest events in the solar industry.10 stocks we like better than Wal-MartWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock     tip, it can pay to listen.

Investors Are Betting Against U.S. Concrete -- Here's Why They're Wrong;3/18/2017;"The construction industry is highly cyclical. When the general   economy is doing well, or even booming, the industry usually   isn't far behind. When growth slows or a recession strikes, the   appetite for construction projects takes a big hit. Luckily for   investors, we're currently in the midst of a broad economic   expansion.That has made construction companies, and specifically those   of cement and concrete manufacturers, some of the best-performing   stocks over the last three years.Vulcan MaterialsandMartin Marietta Materialshave nearly tripled the returns of the S&P 500 during that   period, while the smallerU.S. Concrete(NASDAQ: USCR) has gained an incredible 181%.Although there are great fundamentals supporting the stock's   rise, investors appear to be suspicious. Slightly over 28% of the   the company's shares are traded short, according to numbers   compiled by Yahoo! Finance. There's no denying that shares have   outperformed most other stocks, but I think investors are wrong   to bet against U.S. Concrete. Here's why.makeArticleAd();Image source: Getty Images.Why short-sellers are wrongThe stock trades at an eye-popping 125 times trailing   earnings, but there's an innocent, if not downright weird,   explanation. It may sound odd, but the better the stock performs,   the bigger the company's GAAP net loss becomes. That's because   U.S. Concrete must account for non-cash derivative gains and   losses from fair value changes in its issued warrants when the   stock price moves down or up, respectively, in any given   period.The good news is that recent quarterly GAAP net losses have no   impact on the company's cash position and have not had major   impacts on the share price. The great news is that operations   have maintained a strong level of performance for several years   in a row.U.S. Concrete notched $75 million in operating income and   $1.17 billion in revenue in 2016. Those metrics grew 235% and   95%, respectively, from the performance achieved three years ago.   Operating cash flow reached $112 million last year, which was   well above the $24 million achieved in 2013.In other words, the stock has certainly earned its 181% gain   in the last three years.USCRdata byYCharts.That said, there's a strong case to be made that the company's   growth isn't over. Unlike other cement and concrete   manufacturers, U.S. Concrete has strategically (and almost   exclusively) focused on major metropolitan areas in Texas, New   York/New Jersey, and northern California. Those markets were   responsible for 38%, 31%, and 25%, respectively, of total revenue   in 2016. There are several advantages to that strategy that   short-sellers may be overlooking.First, it allows the company to strategically acquire assets   to become a major and dominant player in each region and city.   Consider that in 2016 alone, U.S. Concrete acquired four smaller   ready-mix concrete operators in the Bronx, Queens, and Brooklyn.   The acquisitions provided the company with 10 ready-mix concrete   plants and 189 mixer trucks. In addition to swiping away   competition, the acquisitions allow the company to make more   competitive bids on larger projects. And in New York City, there   are some pretty big projects.In fact, the company supplied the concrete that built the new   World Trade Center Complex, including Freedom Tower, which was   the highest height concrete has ever been pumped in North   America. Expansions at LaGuardia Airport and the Modern Museum of   Art were also aided by the company, as are other major ongoing   projects in the New York, Dallas-Fort Worth, and San Francisco   metropolitan areas.Second, extending its leadership position in each major market   allows U.S. Concrete to have a greater influence on product   pricing. The fourth quarter of 2016 marked the 23rd straight   quarter that the company achieved year-over-year ready-mix   concrete price increases. That has an obviously beneficial impact   on revenue and margins, and it has played a huge role in the   company's industry-leading margins in the ready-mix concrete   segment. Whereas the average material spread margin in the   industry was 45% last year, U.S. Concrete achieved 49.2%.US Industrial Production: Cementdata byYCharts.Third, operating in urban environments allows the company to   benefit from environmental considerations and initiatives, such   as LEED building certifications. Humans manufacture more cement   than any other material. Unfortunately, cement is also one of the   most carbon-intensive materials to produce, accounting for 5% oftotal global CO2 emissionseach year. While certain materials can be substituted into cement   production processes, they can significantly alter the   performance of mixed concrete. In other words, it's not easy   being green.Luckily, U.S. Concrete is a leading producer of low CO2   concrete. The company's EF Technology can reduce the greenhouse   gas emissions associated with cement production by between 42%   and 46%. Today, over 30% of concrete used by the company benefits   from the technology. That allows it to place highly competitive   bids on major construction projects with LEED requirements -- an   increasingly important consideration. That's especially true in   environmentally conscious San Francisco, where the company has   won projects including the Google Bayview Campus, the Workday   Campus, and even the Golden State Warriors Arena.What does it mean for investors?It takes a bit of digging around the company's primary   strategy and the driving forces for the industry at large, but I   think short-sellers are wrong about this stock. The only way   short-sellers could be right about U.S. Concrete stock is if the   American economy heads for a slowdown, which would have much   broader consequences. While that's not impossible -- in fact,   with recessions occurring every eight years or so, we're ""due""   for one -- it's unlikely to sneak up on investors. The company   works off of a backlog of projects that are agreed to years   prior, which provides fair warning to shareholders of potential   trouble on the horizon. Right now, though, there appears to   be consistent growth ahead for the foreseeable future.10 stocks we like better than US ConcreteWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Microsoft and Alphabet Are Catching Up to Amazon in the Cloud;3/17/2017;"Amazon.com's(NASDAQ: AMZN) all-important Amazon Web Services (AWS) segment   has been the undisputed leader of cloud infrastructure, by far,   for years. The most recent third-party estimate from Canalys pegs   AWS global market share at nearly 34% in the fourth quarter,   larger than the next three largest competitors --Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) ,Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) , andIBM-- combined (31%).Competition is heating up, and rivals are starting to chip   away at AWS' dominance.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();AWS is hugely important to the Amazon thesisThat's the underlying theme of a research note from Pacific   Crest (viaTech Trader Daily). Analyst Brent Bracelin is reiterating an overweight rating but   slightly reducing his price target from $905 to $895, while   expressing some concern that Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud are   starting to catch up and ""becom[e] more viable."" The software and   search giants both continue to invest heavily in their cloud   offerings, both in terms of technical capability as well as   geographic expansion and reach.Since AWS is immensely more profitable that Amazon's core   e-commerce business, its results carry a disproportionate weight   when it comes to the bottom line, and strong AWS performance has   been a key driver of Amazon's rally over the past two years,   which has seen shares more than double.AMZNdata byYCharts.Microsoft Azure is making inroads at large enterprise   customers and government agencies, which are increasingly   transitioning their needs away from their own data center   infrastructures and toward public cloud platforms. Google Cloud   has scored a high-profile win inSnap, which has committed to spending $2 billion with the search   giant and is onlyusing AWS as a backup. Google also recently announced a handful of other big wins for   its cloud business.Bracelin still believes that AWS has a ""multiyear competitive   lead,"" despite rivals starting to catch up in different ways. As   a result, he is tempering his expectations for growth for the   next two years. Overall, the analyst considers decelerating   growth a ""minor concern,"" but it's definitely something that   should be on investors' radar.Rising cloud use lifts all infrastructure vendorsIt's worth pointing out that the cloud infrastructure market   is growing so fast -- up 49% last year and expected to jump   another 46% this year -- that there should be plenty to go   around. The cloud infrastructure market could generate a total of   $55.8 billion in total revenue this year. Of course, the dominant   vendors will compete aggressively, but we're not talking about   zero-sum competition.10 stocks we like better than AmazonWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

3 Companies Set to Make a Killing From Driverless Cars;3/17/2017;"Driverless car technology is still in its nascent stage but   will grow in leaps and bounds in the coming years. IHS Automotive   forecasts that autonomous vehicle sales will shoot up from   600,000 units in 2025 to almost 21 million by 2035, clocking a   compound annual growth rate of 43%.The Boston Consulting Group, meanwhile, expects the driverless   car market to create a $42 billion revenue opportunity in 2025   itself, indicating that there is a lot of money to be made in   this space. One of the ways to tap this huge opportunity is   through technology providers such asAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) ,Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) , andNVIDIA(NASDAQ: NVDA) , as they will play mission-critical roles in   enabling autonomous cars.NVIDIA's GPUs are boosting self-driving technologyNVIDIA is best known for making gaming graphics cards, but its   products are in high demand from automakers as well.Tesla, for instance, is using the chipmaker's artificial   intelligence-based DRIVE PX2 platform in the Model S and Model X   cars. What's more, the automaker is also going to deploy NVIDIA's   supercomputer in its mass-market Model 3.makeArticleAd();The Tesla partnership is already delivering results, as   NVIDIA's automotive revenue shot up over 37% year over year for   the fiscal fourth quarter. The company could sustain its   automotive momentum, as it is working with German giant Audi to   bring a Level 4 autonomous car to the market by 2020. Level 4   means it can drive itself entirely on its own.The two companies showcased an Audi Q7 at CES earlier this   year, claiming that the car learned to drive on its own in just   four days using NVIDIA's AI-based DRIVE PX2 supercomputer. More   importantly, NVIDIA is looking to push the envelope: It's now   working on a more advanced supercomputing platform -- Xavier --   that consumes less power but packs more computing capacity.NVIDIA's graphics processing units accelerate the processing   of huge amounts of data in real time, allowing the vehicle to   make quick decisions. As the company increasingly turns its   attention toward making its self-driving supercomputers better   through partnerships with big auto companies, it won't be   surprising if its platform ends up powering fully autonomous cars   by 2020.NVIDIA, therefore, looks right on the edge of tapping the   driverless car opportunity, as 80 companies are using the DRIVE   PX2 platform to develop their technology.Microsoft's big data opportunityDriverless cars, or any connected car for that matter, will   generate huge volumes of data from their sensors and cameras that   will need storage and processing. Microsoftwants to ingestall this data and then use its artificial intelligence (AI)   skills to analyze it to help cars drive better through its Azure   cloud-based Connected Vehicle Platform.Image source: Microsoft.The Redmond-based company has picked a sweet spot to tap the   driverless car opportunity, as a connected vehicle is slated to   produce 20 gigabytes of data per day in 2017 if driven for just   two hours. In the case of autonomous cars, the data generation   could be at least 10 gigabytes per second. Now, all this data   can't be stored on the car itself due to limited storage   capacity, creating an opportunity for Microsoft to push its cloud   product to automakers.TheRenault-Nissanalliance has already decided to use the software giant's   connected vehicle platform, pledging to put 10 cars with   autonomous technology on the road by 2020. Additionally, Indian   automakerTata Motorsis adopting the platform to bring connectivity   features and predictive maintenance at affordable prices to   mass-market vehicles in India.Microsoft is also finding demand for its connected car   platform beyond automakers. For instance, reinsurance provider   Swiss Re will analyze driving behavior with the help of the   telematics data collected by the cloud, and then create   customized insurance deals for customers.The inevitable data increase from driverless and connected   cars could power Microsoft's Azure cloud business to new highs in   the long run, allowing it to sustain rapid revenue growth from   this segment.Image source: Waymo.Alphabet's Waymo moonshot could be a big businessAlphabet's Waymo division has thebest driverless cartechnology, according to data from the California DMV. As it   turns out, its driverless cars have the lowest incidence rates   and the highest miles logged compared to the others testing their   technology on California roads.Alphabet can use its lead in this space by becoming an   infrastructure and knowledge supplier to auto companies, and this   is what it is probably planning to do. Earlier this year, Waymo   announced that it is going to manufacture   driverless-technology-enabling sensors on its own so that it can   better integrate the software into hardware.In fact, the Waymo division has slashed the price of the   crucial LIDAR sensor by 90% since 2009, so it makes sense for it   to offer a packaged hardware-software bundle to potential   customers. The company has already gained a customer in the form   ofFiat Chrysler Automobilesfor its self-driving technology, with Bloombergreportingthat both companies could eventually roll out a ride-sharing   service.On the other hand,Hondaseems to be warming up to Waymo's self-driving capabilities to   accelerate its own driverless car development. The Japanese   automaker is now exploring the possibility of equipping its cars   with fully autonomous driving technology in cities instead of its   earlier ambition of just highway driving.Therefore, Alphabet's years of leadership in driverless cars   make it one of the hottest prospects to benefit from this   emerging technology.10 stocks we like better than MicrosoftWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock       tip, it can pay to listen.

4 Famous Tech Stocks That Could Lose Their Fangs;3/17/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe so-called ""FANG stocks"" have been an incredibly-well performing group. For those who don't know, FANG consists ofFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB),Amazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN),Netflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX) andAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) - formerly Google.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockWhy has this group been so successful? Despite a few of them sporting lofty valuations, they are the respective kings of their industries. Facebook dominates social media, Netflix owns streaming, Amazon is the king of e-commerce and Google owns the online search engine.Over the past five years, Alphabet is the worst performing of the FANG stocks, returning ""just"" 180%. After that, it's Facebook, which has generated 265%. Amazon's 360% return stands out and Netflix's 830% gain jumps off the page. Have these stocks gone too far, though?7 Small-Cap Tech Stocks on the Cutting EdgeI wouldn't necessarily argue that. Some names warrant some extra caution in my view, however. Let's take a further look to see which stocks are worth holding onto and which are worth taking profits in.FANG Stocks: Facebook (FB)Source:The Crunchies! via FlickrWe'll keep the FANG stocks in order, so let's begin withFacebook. Facebook has impressively captivated billions of users through its platform. At last check, Facebook catered to 1.23 billion daily active users, an 18% increase year-over-year. Monthly active users of 1.86 billion increased 17% year-over-year.Even more impressively, Facebook has found a way to grow its revenue growth. That may seem like a typo, but it's not. FB has managed to not only grow sales on a year-over-year basis, but also accelerate that rate of growth as well. After impressively growing sales in the 40% to 49% range through fiscal 2015, FB has now managed 50%+ revenue growth for five consecutive quarters. Obviously the company hasfound a way to continually growand its users are not tiring of its various ad formats.FB stock is not egregiously priced either; with a forward price-earnings ratio of just 21, Facebook shares are not that expensive with earnings per share expected to grow 28.1% this year and 23.4% next year.Throw in the fact that Facebook has topped earnings expectations over the past 13 quarters and the stock becomes even more attractive. Shares have been on a tear this year. But a pullback to its 50-day moving average near $131 could be a buying opportunity.FANG Stocks: Amazon (AMZN)Source: ShutterstockAMZN stockhas also done well in 2017, up 14%. We all know about the decaying retail sector and Amazon's ability to capitalize on that weakness. But judging the future of commerce can be difficult, especially with how quickly Amazon continues to move.The biggest concern for Amazon skeptics has been earnings. Despite years of 20%-plus revenue growth, AMZN's bottom line has hugged the flatline. Management argues that it's investing in itself for even more growth and so far, investors have been patient. They've also been rewarded. Over the past 10 years, shares are up more than 2,000%. Thankfully, Amazon started to pad its bottom line with its Web Services cloud business.While I personally love Amazon, I would be a bit leery of AMZN stock at these prices. Just last year we found out the hard way how fast things can change with sentiment. In the beginning of 2016, AMZN stock stumbled from $675 to sub-$500 in just five weeks. That 26% haircut startled plenty of investors, despite the stock rebounding to north of $800 a share within a year.The lesson here is simple: Amazon shares are not invincible during pullbacks. Should we get a notable broader market correction, AMZN stock will not be spared. That is the best time tobuy the stock. Now that it's through the holiday season andcontinues to invest at a heavy pace, shares could struggle in the intermediate term.7 Small-Cap Tech Stocks on the Cutting EdgeA decline to its 200-day moving average would be a great place to initiate a long position. That mark is currently near $780 per share. Any further declines could be used to accumulate the stock.FANG Stocks:Netflix (NFLX)Source:Via NetflixNFLX stockis one a lot of investors are kicking themselves over. Shares languished below $100 through most of 2016. At the time, some feared higher content costs and sloppy overseas execution.Those fears still exist to some point, but Netflix has shown better execution as of late. As a result, shares have catapulted to north of $140. The stock has been consolidating nicely around this level. With the 50-day moving average just below, it appears Netflix may be setting up for amove to new all-time highs.Investors who want to buy now could use the 50-day moving average - or a price just below - as their stop-loss. They could also wait for a possible decline to its 200-day moving average, currently just below $115, to buy. Longer-term investors may consider initiating a position in the name, with a plan to purchase more on additional declines.The problem with NFLX stock is simple: valuation. Not many investors question the shift in video content consumption. The trend is in favor of Netflix, which holds a dominant position in the streaming world. I consider Netflix a very battleground-based stock. On the one hand, it's trailing P/E ratio of 384 is near the top of its five-year range. On the other hand, its forward P/E ratio is the lowest it's been in the same time frame.The streaming offerings from Alphabet's YouTube, as well asHulucould also be a concern. For now, the bulls seem to be in control of NFLX stock. Should Netflix's execution deteriorate or competition eat into its growth, the narrative may change. But for now, staying long Netflix seems like it will work.FANG Stocks: Alphabet (GOOGL)Source: ShutterstockLike Facebook, one of the main attractions toAlphabetis actually the valuation. Trading at 21.8 times next year's earnings, shares of Alphabet aren't priced too expensive. Analysts expect GOOGL to churn out earnings growth of 17.5% next year, along with 19.3% annual earnings growth over the next five years.Alphabet's founders may have paved the way for internet domination. But there's a new team member to its C-suite that has given GOOGL a much-needed boost. CFO Ruth Porat joined the company in May 2015.In the year leading up to her hire, shares had been stagnant, returning just 5%. Since her addition, though, the stock is up a whopping 60%. Does it also seem like a coincidence that Alphabet missed analysts' estimates on at least six straight quarters prior to her arrival? Since then, Alphabet has topped estimates in five of the past six quarters.Admittedly, Alphabet's transparency has been better, making it easier for analysts to form estimates. But this added clarity makes it easier on investors and helps lower volatility. For better or for worse, Alphabet takes some gambles. For instance, consider Alphabet's self-driving car unit, Waymo. Porat has not stifled this growth. Rather, she has reigned in expenses and channeled GOOGL's focus. As a result, the bottom line has improved,without future potential being eliminated.8 Places to Run and Hide in a Market CrashWith a consistent core business in Google and potential upsides in businesses like Waymo, GOOGL stock is attractive. With its dependable growth and a reasonable valuation, it's even better. At just a hair under all-time highs, though, now may not be the best time to buy. A retest of its 50-day moving average near $840 and a further decline to its 200-day moving average near $800 would offer better entry opportunities.As of this writing, Bret Kenwell did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.The post4 Famous Tech Stocks That Could Lose Their Fangsappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Privacy Revamp Makes Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Even More Attractive;3/17/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsScore one for civil liberties. This week, social networking giantFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) overhauled its privacy policies,blocking police departments from using the siteas a means of keeping tabs on users who may also be associated with violent protesting.makeArticleAd();On the surface, it may seem irrelevant to the current and future value of Facebook stock. Most members of the ad-driven platform know they're of no interest to law enforcement officials, and the protestors that were making themselves known on the social media site likely didn't know they were being watched (and therefore didn't alter the way and frequency with which they used the website).In other words,so what?Thing is, it's more than conceivable there were enough users of the Facebook platform that had been steering clear due to privacy concerns - just on principle - to expect them to log on now that their privacy is being protected.Privacy Remains Contentious TopicIt's neither a new debate, nor is it a minor one.Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL)battled the FBI early last yearover the bureau's request that the company unlock an iPhone as part of a terrorism investigation.Alphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) has long been deemed to be too intrusive,keeping a detailed dossier on everyone who uses Google and its servicesthat facilitates more target marketing.EvenWal-Mart Stores Inc(NYSE:WMT) is getting in on the snooping act,using cameras to watch what shoppers pick up in stores, and then put down without purchasing.So, in the grand scheme of things, it's not difficult to believe that Facebook was looking the other way when it knew law enforcement officials were using its platform as a new tool in the war on crime.7 Dividend Stocks With Yields That Grow Like WeedsThe question Facebook stock holders should be asking: At what point does accommodating every policy and agency request make the website too alarming for even the average user to visit?The American Civil Liberties Union asked the question, and thenanswered it in a way that put Facebook in a questionable light. The company responded with a change in its policy.New Policies Curtail PinpointingAs of Monday, police and other law enforcement agenciescan no longer tap Geofeedia's data, which was built to pinpoint where Facebook users are - Facebook completely cut off Geofeedia's access to the site. It's not necessarily a permanent hurdle, but it is one that will remain in place indefinitely on the location-based analytics platform.Facebook's deputy chief privacy officer Rob Sherman commented: ""Our goal is to make our policy explicit.""New PageThe clarified policy does not preclude FB from assisting law enforcement officials on a case-by-case basis. Indeed, the company says it still intends to assist police when appropriate. Presumably, this would mean instances where a search warrant has been issued, which requires a reasonable suspicion that retrieving such information would help lead to a successful prosecution.Twitter Inc(NYSE:TWTR) and Facebook unit Instagram also booted Geofeedia from using their websites to gather and sell user information following the ACLU's exposure of the organization's invasive tactics.Bottom Line for Facebook StockOn the surface it seems like a potential setback for Facebook, and by extension for Facebook stock. One of the most compelling features of the social media platform to advertisers was the deep, broad, and well-defined data the company could collect about each and every user.If it's scaling that detail back - and presumably it's doing so to more developers than just Geofeedia - then the potential value to advertisers is crimped.Amgen, Inc. (AMGN) Stock Crashed. Here's How to Trade.Don't overthink it, though, and don't assume there's a cut-and-dried if/then relationship between how invasive a website can be and how valuable detailed user data is to an advertiser. They say they want stratification, but many advertisers are content to promote their product or service to any reasonably targeted consumer.On the other hand, consumers are more apt to use caution when it comes to websites that may nefariously collect data on a consumer, even without their consent or knowledge. People have a decent sixth sense when it comes to being unreasonably monitored.In other words, a FB that's more interested in basic civil rights is a better investment than one that's not. The trade-off is more than palatable.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace7 Blue-Chip Stocks Holding You Back10 Mutual Funds You Can Buy and Hold Forever10 Monthly Dividend Stocks to Buy to Pay the BillsThe postPrivacy Revamp Makes Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Even More Attractiveappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Google and Facebook Will Account for 74% of Digital Ad Growth in 2017;3/17/2017;"Marketers will continue to shift a larger percentage of their   ad budgets to digital in 2017. U.S. digital ad spending is   expected to reach $83 billion this year, up 16% according toeMarketer.By far, the two biggest digital advertisers areFacebook(NASDAQ: FB) and Google, a subsidiary ofAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) . The two will combine to take 57%   of the market this year. That's up from 54% last year as the two   combine to take about 74% of all the growth in U.S. ad spend.Even with the recent introduction of ads on the extremely   popular Snapchat fromSnap(NYSE: SNAP) and continued pressure fromTwitter(NYSE:TWTR) andMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) , the two giants continue to completely dominate   the competition.makeArticleAd();Image source: Google.Google search takes $0.78 of every dollarGoogle's biggest business, search, is also its biggest growth   driver. Google's search ad revenue is expected to climb 16% this   year compared to its overall revenue growth of 15%. eMarketer   expects Google to take 78% of all U.S. search ad spend as it   takes share from Microsoft and other smaller competitors. The   search giant will bring in about $28.6 billion from search ads   this year, according to the research group.Google's growth stems largely from mobile. Android is the most   popular mobile operating system in the U.S., and Google is the   default search engine on iOS, the second most popular mobile   operating system. Microsoft's efforts to penetrate the mobile   market largely fell flat, although it is the search engine behind   Siri on iOS.Americans use Google for about 94% of their searches on   mobile. As mobile continues to account for more and more of our   time, Google's lead in search will only grow wider.Facebook dominates display advertisingWhile Google grows more dominant in search, Facebook is   increasingly dominant in display ads. eMarketer expects   Facebook's U.S. advertising to grow 32.1% to $16.33 billion this   year. Google is its next closest competitor, and it's expected to   generate just $5.24 billion from display ads.Image source: Facebook.eMarketer's projection for U.S. ad revenue growth is actually   below analysts' consensus estimate for Facebook's overall revenue   growth this year. It's worth noting the U.S. is historically   Facebook's largest and one of the faster-growing regions in terms   of revenue. However, saturation in ad load could cause U.S. ad   growth to slow more significantly compared to regions where   Facebook has faster user growth.Instagram will make a significant contribution to Facebook's   U.S. ad revenue this year, growing to account for about 20% of   Facebook's total on mobile, up from 15% last year. Mobile   accounted for 84% of Facebook's total ad revenue last   quarter.The competition can't touch Facebook or GoogleOne of Facebook and Google's biggest competitors in display   advertising, Twitter, is expected to see its mobile ad revenue   decline for the first time in its history. Its revenue on mobile   devices will fall about 5% to $1.15 billion, according to   eMarketer. Mobile accounted for 89% of Twitter's total ad revenue   in the fourth quarter.The expected to decline comes after management provided anemic   first-quarter guidance and followed it up byde-emphasizing certain ad products. Twitter is shifting its focus to its most profitable products   in order to make good on its effort to become profitable this   year.Meanwhile, Snapchat is a growing force in video ads. Indeed,   eMarketer expects the company's U.S. ad revenue to grow 158% to   $770 million. Even with its robust growth, Snap's app revenue   still only accounts for 1.2% of the total U.S. mobile ad market,   and just 4% of the total growth in U.S. digital advertising.Even with strong competition, Facebook and Google continue to   dominate the market as users flock to their services.

5 Signs Snap Inc's High Growth Days are Over;3/17/2017;"Snap(NYSE: SNAP) , the parent company of Snapchat, made its public   debut on March 3, and the results were underwhelming. Snap made   its public debut at $17, surged to nearly $30 on the first day,   then tumbled back to just over $20 in less than two weeks.Why did investors seemingly snub Snap, which some bulls have   hailed as the ""nextFacebook(NASDAQ: FB) ""? The answer is simple -- six red flags indicate   that the stock could slide much lower before it's considered a   bargain.Snap's Android app. Image source: Google Play.makeArticleAd();1. Slowing user growthThe decline ofTwitter's (NYSE:TWTR) stocktaught usthat social networks live and die by their active user growth.   Without active user growth, advertisers start skipping the   platform in favor of faster growing ones. Snapchat's daily active   users (DAUs) rose just  3% sequentially to 158 million last   quarter, compared to 7% growth in the third quarter and 17%   growth in the second quarter.That slowdown was likely caused by the launch of new   Snapchat-like features for Facebook's Instagram and Messenger   apps -- which include Instagram Stories, vanishing Instagram   photos, Instant Video for Messenger, and a Messenger Day app   which deletes photos and videos after 24 hours. Instagram   Stories, in particular, grew its DAUs from 100 million to 150   million between last October and  this January.2. Its cash burn rateSnap's S-1 filing revealed that it finished fiscal 2016 with   just $150.1 million in cash and equivalents -- a 77% decline from   $640.8 million at the end of 2015. The company had a negative   operating cash flow of $188 million in the fourth quarter of   2016, and it burned through $1.14 in cash for each dollar in    generated revenue.Snap will retain $2.3 billion of the $3.2 billion it    raised during its IPO. That amount will help Snap tread   water for a while, but it might not last long if its cash burn   rate accelerates. Susquehanna analysts believe that Snap won't   achieve positive free cash flow until fiscal 2020. However, that   estimate could be far too optimistic if rivals like Instagram   Stories continue throttling Snapchat's growth.3. Widening lossesSnap's revenue surged 590% to $404.5 million in 2016. But on   the bottom line, its net losswidenedfrom $372.9 million to $514.6 million. The company's biggest   expenses include multi-billion dollar cloud contracts withAlphabet's Google andAmazon.If Snap can't narrow its losses with such massive revenue   growth, things could getveryugly once its top line growth slows down. Snap has also warned in   its SEC filing that it ""may never achieve or maintain   profitability.""4. Unrealistic revenue growth targetsSnap claims that it can  generate $500 million to $1   billion in revenues in 2017. That's a very wide range, but   analysts are modeling their forecasts on  the high-end, with   an average estimate of $1.04 billion. However, it's unclear how   Snap plans to hit that target.The three types of Snap ads. Image source: Snap.96% of Snap's revenue came from advertising in 2016. Snap's ad    products include full-screen video ads, sponsored   geofilters, and sponsored lenses. If Snap's user growth peaks, it   could possibly boost its number of marketing partners to generate   higher ad revenues per customer. But more than doubling its 2016   revenues to $1 billion in 2017 seems like ahugestretch.Research firm eMarketer recently trimmed its 2017 ad    revenue forecast for Snapchat from $800 million to $770   million. That reduction was modest, but it indicates that   analysts aren't certain that it can hit its ambitious growth   targets.5. It thinks it's a ""camera company""Co-founder and CEO Evan Spiegel has repeatedly declared that   Snap is different from other social networks because it's a   ""camera company."" Tthat statement sounded reasonable because it   produced special filters and lenses for smartphone cameras, but   rivals like Instagram can easily make similar claims.Snap's Spectacles. Image source: Snap.Spiegel didn't say that Snap would sell physical cameras   anytime soon, but the company launched its Spectacles   Snap-capturing glasses late last year. The devices attracted lots   of shoppers, thanks to a clever marketing campaign featuring   vanishingvending machines.If Snap builds upon that idea, it could start selling other   cheap image capture devices to build its brand and differentiate   itself from Instagram. However, that move could cause it to burn   through its cash even faster and weigh down its bottom line with   a low-margin hardware business.Should you avoid Snap?Snap looks like a company that went public before it formed a   coherent roadmap toward positive cash flows and profitability.   Without the ability to reach those goals, Snap remains an   incredibly overvalued stock at nearly 60 times sales.To put that into perspective, Facebook had a P/S ratio of   about 10 at the close of its first trading day. Twitter ended its   first day with a P/S ratio of about 11. This means that Snap   could easily plummet to the single digits if investors realize   that this ephemeral emperor has no clothes.10 stocks we like better than Snap Inc.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Stock Market News for March 17, 2017;3/17/2017;"Benchmarks finished mostly in the red on Thursday after declines in healthcare and energy stocks outpaced gains in financials sectors. Healthcare stocks declined yesterday following President Trump's move to slash the overall budget for medical research and increase regulatory fees. Moreover, rising crude oversupply concerns weighed on energy stocks. Financial stocks rallied northward following optimism that Fed's decision to hike interest rates will boost the sector, which in turn helped curb some of the day's losses.For a look at the issues currently facing the markets, make sure to read today'sAhead of Wall Streetarticle.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) decreased 0.1%, to close at 20,934.55.

For 54% stocks that advanced, 43% declined.What Dragged the Benchmarks?The White House released its 2018 federal budget proposal which intends to reduce the National Institutes of Health's (NIH) spending on medical research by $5.8 billion. Moreover, regulatory fees collected by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration are expected to increase to more than $2 billion, double the amount for this year. Concerns about higher regulatory costs and lower spending resulted in a selloff for the healthcare sector.The Health Care Select Sector SPDR (XLV) decreased 1% and was one of the major decliners among the S&P 500 sectors. Also, the key biotech index iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology (IBB) fell 1.3%. Some of its key holdings including Amgen Inc. (AMGN) and Biogen Inc. (BIIB) declined 1.4% and 4.7%, respectively.

Domestic crude inventories declined last week by 0.2 million barrels but still remained at a record level of 528.2 million barrels. This is expected to have a negative impact on other major oil producing nations in their efforts to control a global crude supply glut.Rising crude supply worries led the WTI and Brent crude to decrease 0.2% and 0.1% to $48.75 a barrel and $51.74 per barrel respectively. Decline in oil prices resulted in a 0.7% decrease in the Energy Select Sector SPDR (XLE). Dow component Chevron Corporation (CVX) fell 0.9%.Although financial stocks faltered following the Fed's unexpectedly cautious approach regarding the path of future rate hikes, investors have warmed up to the sector.

IBM Watson Health Inks Deal with MedyMatch for Healthcare AI;3/17/2017;"International Business Machines CorporationIBMowned Watson Health has recently inked a five-year agreement with MedyMatch, an artificial intelligence (AI) startup based in Israel. The objective of the deal is to integrate MedyMatch's AI technology with Watson Health for enhanced detection of bleeding in the brain as a result of stroke or head trauma.Initially, IBM Watson Health will launch the MedyMatch brain bleeding detection application globally. Later, the two companies will proceed toward integrating and achieving interoperability between IBM Watson Health's imaging offerings and MedyMatch's AI application.Reportedly, IBM will incur several millions of dollars as recurring annual licensing fees to MedyMatch over the span of the agreement.Notably, shares of IBM have underperformed the ZacksComputer - Integrated Systemsindustry over the last one year. While the industry gained a modest 24.3%, the stock appreciated only 20.5%.The underperformance of the stock could be due to the time consuming transition to the cloud, weakness in traditional businesses and lower IT spending worldwide. However, we expect the stock to rebound given such strategic deals.What Does This Mean for IBM?As per a report by the World Health Organization, nearly 7.6 million people are likely to be affected by stroke by 2030. As per another report by Zion Market Research, worldwide spending on global stroke diagnostics and therapeutics is estimated to reach $31 billion by 2021 at a CAGR of 7%.There is thus a huge scope for application of IBM's cognitive technology as it helps in detecting bleeding in the brain as a result of stroke or trauma.We note that Watson Health has been fast gaining traction in the recent times. Earlier this month, the company launched IBM Watson Imaging Clinical Review, a cognitive imaging offering, at the Health IT Conference for 2017 to address various cardiovascular diseases. (Read More:IBM Watson Introduces Cognitive Imaging to Boost Healthcare).Also, earlier this year, IBM Watson Health partnered with the FDA to advance cancer research. (Read More :IBM Watson Health, FDA Partner to Further Cancer Research).Although competition is intensifying in the cognitive healthcare solutions space with the presence of major players such as Alphabet'sGOOGLDeepmind Health and Microsoft'sMSFTHealthcare NExT, strategic partnerships such as these are expected to further strengthen IBM's  position in the long run. Also, Watson Health's recent partnership with FDA over cancer research augurs well for the company in the long run.International Business Machines Corporation Price and   ConsensusInternational Business Machines Corporation Price   and Consensus|International Business Machines Corporation QuoteZacks RankAt present, IBM carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the broader technology space is Fortinet, Inc.FTNT, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

3 Stocks to Buy -- Even in a Bull Market;3/17/2017;"There's no doubt about it: We're right smack in the middle of   a bull market. The S&P 500 is up about 70% over the past five   years and about 18% in the past 12 months alone. While this   is great for investors who already own stocks, it means it's more   difficult for investors to find attractive stocks to buy   today.But rest assured there are still some solid long-term bets.   Here are three that stand out even in this raging bull market:Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) ,Yum! Brands(NYSE: YUM) , andWells Fargo(NYSE: WFC) . Even after rising about 17%, 14%, and 19%,   respectively, in the past 12 months, each of these stocks still   looks attractive today.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();AlphabetWhile Alphabet, parent company of Google, is a pure technology   stock, investors shouldn't automatically assume it's just another   risky tech stock. On the contrary, Alphabet's leadership in   search has carved out a wide economic moat for the company.Alphabet's Google advertising business, which comprises about   86% of Alphabet's total revenue, is driven by the company's   powerful search business. Helping Google's advertising revenue   increase 17% year over year, Alphabet's search business not only   remains dominant, but its lead over competition even seems to be   increasing. Research company eMarketer recently forecasted   Alphabet's share of U.S. search advertising will increase from   75.8% to 80% in 2018, thanks to the company's timely and   aggressive investments in mobile search.With a price-to-earnings ratio of about 30, Alphabet isn't   cheap. But a wide economic moat and persistent strong growth make   this stock worth owning.Yum! BrandsYum! Brands offers investors a way to buy into a collection of   some of the most well-known food franchises on the planet: KFC,   Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell. With these highly scalable   quick-service restaurants under its ownership, Yum! Brands is   well positioned to not only grow, but also to pay investors a   solid dividend while it's at it; management expects annualized   growth in system sales and operating profit of about 7% in   constant currency, and the stock currently offers a dividend   yield of about 1.9%.With a price-to-earnings ratio of about 26, Yum! Brands   certainly isn't trading at a deep discount. But its sustainable   business model and management's expectations for robust system   sales make this stock look tasty.Wells FargoAs the biggest bank in the U.S. measured by deposits, Wells   Fargo is a bet on a bank with significant scale. Add in Wells   Fargo's emphasis of enduring customer relationships, operational   excellence, and conservative risk management, Wells Fargo is   nearly in a class of its own.While the bank's sales culture created some ethical problems   for the company recently, it's worth noting that even famed   investor Warren Buffett'sBerkshire Hathawayhasn't sold a single share of the bankamid the high-profile headlines -- a notable move considering   Wells Fargo is Berkshire's biggest holding, valued at about $30   billion.While Wells Fargo is up sharply recently, its attractiveness   is highlighted by its 2.6% dividend yield and its conservative   price-to-book ratio of 1.7 (which is still well below   pre-recession levels). Further, the stock still trades at a   fairly conservative price-to-earnings ratio of about 15.In a bull market like this, a pullback in the overall stock   market is certainly possible -- and these three stocks could very   well suffer along with the market if this happens. But these are   the sort of stocks that have a good chance of performing solidly   on a five-year time horizon even if they are purchased at today's   prices.10 stocks we like better than AlphabetWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

"Google Eyes Algorithm Enhancement, Flags ""Offensive"" Content";3/17/2017;"makeZacksArticleAd();Alphabet Inc.'sGOOGLGoogle is reportedly taking steps to spot potentially upsetting or offensive content and reduce their appearance on the search results page. This will result in more accurate, realistic and truthful information for users.Guidelines Updated With a New SectionGoogle uses around 10,000 contractors across the world as quality raters of its search results. The company has added the option of flagging ""Upsetting-Offensive"" content in its guidelines to these quality raters.They now can now flag content that promotes harmful activities such as discrimination or violence against any group of people, animal cruelty, child abuse, racial slurs or human trafficking. Basically any hurtful or displeasing content may be flagged depending upon the motive of a search.The Broader Plan of Algorithm EnhancementData from quality raters will be used to train human coders (search algorithm writers) as well as update machine learning system on how to differentiate upsetting and offensive content from factual and appropriate ones.The broader aim is to make search algorithms capable of automatically flagging such content. This can happen if the algorithms better understand the motive of a particular search and display results accordingly.However, that doesn't necessarily mean that that an offensive or upsetting content will not appear on the search results page. Rather, the enhanced search algorithm will display results if it finds an explicit search being made for such content.We believe that Google's near-monopoly position in the search market is likely to drive Alphabet's stock price going ahead. Its shares have appreciated 15.2% in the last one year compared with the ZacksInternet-Servicesindustry'sgain of 11.6%.Our TakeWe believe that updates of this kind will improve Google's search quality and furnish quality results.

Why This Market Researcher Lowered Its Revenue Expectations for Snap;3/16/2017;"Analysts haven't been kind toSnap(NYSE: SNAP) since it made its IPO. Not one analyst has given   Snap stock a buy rating, and shares have fallen considerably from   its opening price at the beginning of the month.Most recently, market researcher eMarketer lowered its   expectations for Snap's U.S. ad revenue from $800 million to $770   million. The reason behind the lower estimate is   ""higher-than-estimated revenue sharing with partners.""Snapchat offers revenue sharing as an incentive for content   publishers to use its Publisher Stories (formerly Discover)   format. Snap is also partnering with various media companies to   produce original shows, which may provide even more favorable   revenue share for the content producer.makeArticleAd();Let's take a look at how revenue sharing affects Snap's   financials.Image source: Snap/Author.Revenue sharing doesn't impact Snap's top lineWhile eMarketer is lowering its expectations for Snapchat, the   actual decline in net ad revenue won't show up in Snap's top   line. Snap reports gross revenue similarly to howAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) reports Google's revenue. Google   lumps in revenue from its network partners with its search and   YouTube revenue, and then accounts for revenue sharing as part of   its traffic acquisition costs.The amount of revenue Snap shares with its publisher partners   is then reported as an item in the company's cost of revenue. So,   eMarketer may have well said it expects Snap's cost of revenue to   come in $30 million higher than originally anticipated.Snap's Publisher Stories. Image source: Snap.Last year, Snap says revenue sharing payments increased $48.2   million from 2015, but it doesn't provide a specific amount it   paid to partners. That does at least provide a floor, and it's   nearly 12% of Snap's $404.5 million in total revenue last   year.For comparison, Google paid out $10.9 billion in revenue   sharing to its network partners (not including YouTube) in 2016.   That's almost 14% of its total ad revenue for the year.Revenue sharing may increase even fasterWhile most analysts expect Snap to grow its top line to around   $1 billion this year, its path to that mark may mean less of that   revenue makes it past the second line (cost of revenue) on its   income statement. Snap has inked several high-profile deals with   media companies over the last year.It already has deals in place with NBC, ABC, BBC, Turner, New   York Time, Discovery, Time, A+E Networks, and VICE to produce   original shows for Snapchat. Snap is still actively pursuing   these high-profile deals.It's important to note that Snap says its revenue-sharing   arrangements ""generally do not contain minimum financial   commitments to our publisher partners and are generally not tied   to specific events or promotions."" That seems to indicate Snap   doesn't pay anything up front for these productions, but Snap may   help out with the costs as ""content creation costs"" also show up   in management's description of cost of revenue. Content creation   costs include personnel-related costs, according to Snap's   S-1.With the growth of the Publisher Stories platform, investors   should expect a stark increase in cost of goods sold due to   revenue-sharing and content-creation costs.Cost of revenue is already under scrutinySnap posted a negative gross margin last year as its cost of   revenue overshadowed its revenue. The biggest factor behind it is   Snap's hosting expenses, for which it primarily relies on Google   Cloud. It's already committed to spending $3 billion in total on   cloud infrastructure over the next five years, which will   continue to put pressure on Snap's gross margin as it tries to   scale.Add to that the fact that one of its revenue drivers is   growing content from publisher partners, which contributes to   even more cost of revenue. While a few tens of millions of   dollars is relatively small compared to the hundreds of millions   Snap is spending with its cloud partners each year, Snap's   margins are so thin that every dollar counts.10 stocks we like better than Snap Inc.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Better Buy: Intel Corporation vs. NVIDIA;3/16/2017;"Intel(NASDAQ: INTC) andNVIDIA(NASDAQ: NVDA) are titans of the same semiconductor industry,   born a generation apart. As in all human endeavors, the only   constant in business is change, and Intel and NVIDIA find   themselves today at different stages of their corporate life   cycles.Thanks to coming adoption of technologies such as self-driving   cars and artificial-intelligence (AI) software, NVIDIA has seen   demand for its graphics chips move from a niche into the   mainstream. On the other hand, Intel roared to global dominance   during the rise of PCs and mainframe servers, but it has   struggled to tap into more recent growth markets such as mobile   computing, deep learning, and the like.So which is the better stock for you to buy today: Intel or   NVIDIA? Let's examine three different aspects for NVIDIA and   Intel to determine which companies' shares appear more attractive   today.makeArticleAd();Financial fortitudeThose same life-cycle differences reveal themselves in   assessing the financial strength of NVIDIA and Intel. Look at   these four important metrics of liquidity and solvency for both   companies.CompanyCash and InvestmentsDebtCash From OperationsCurrent RatioNVIDIA$6.8 billion$2.8 billion$1.7 billion4.7Intel$14.9 billion$25.2 billion$21.8 billion1.7Data sources: NVIDA and Intel investor relations; Yahoo!   Finance.NVIDIA easily beats Intel in terms of near-term liquidity --   as evidenced by its current ratio -- and in terms of net debt,   which is just a fancy accounting term for cash and equivalents   minus debt. That being said, Intel's cash flow-generation   capabilities are staggering. Though $18.4 billion of its debt   will mature in 2022 or later, Intel could easily erase the   majority of its leverage in a single year, even after subtracting   the $9.6 billion it spent on capital expenditures in 2016.Intel is also an example of a company that uses debt, or a   leveraged capital structure, as a source of competitive   advantage. It's one of the few semiconductor companies that also   owns its chip fabrication plants; NVIDIA outsources its fab to a   consortium of partners includingTaiwan Semiconductor,Samsung, and more. Operating large fixed assets such as   semiconductor manufacturing plants requires plenty of capital,   which explains Intel's use of ample leverage. Either way, both   companies are in fine financial shape, given their respective   strategies, so let's call this one a tie and move on.Winner: Tie.Image source: Getty Images.Durable competitive advantagesNVIDIA and Intel each enjoy meaningful competitive advantages   in their respective areas of the global semiconductor market.Sources estimate Intel controls 87% of the PC CPU market and   95% the server CPU market, although the exact numbers aren't as   important as knowing that Intel dominates the global PC and data   center microprocessor markets, and for a predictable reason:   Intel's longtime performance advantage over the competition --   namely,Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD)  -- has allowed the company to charge higher   prices per unit for its chips.Intel plows an aggressive portion of its profits back into its   research and development, which has, in turn, allowed it to   maintain the performance advantages of its chips. Barring   execution risks, which have been a concern fromtime to time, this long-standing trend has served as a virtuous cycle that   has allowed Intel to dominate its core markets and consistently   produce above-average profits for its shareholders.The dollar values involved help flesh this dynamic out a bit   more. In the past three years, AMD's revenue has totaled $4.2   billion in 2016, $3.9 billion in 2015, and $5.5 billion in   2014. In contrast, Intel's research-and-development budgetalonehas totaled $12.7 billion, $12.1 billion, and $11.5 billion over   the same period. This kind of structural advantage is   incredibly difficult to overcome.NVIDIA's competitive advantages are more technological than   structural at the moment. Because of its long-standing place as   the creator graphics computing, on which it still focuses,   NVIDIA's chips have generally been the best of breed in each of   the graphics processing applications its products serve. The   company pressed that advantage with last year's debut of its   Pascal architecture, around which it launched a number of new   chips.Better still, NVIDIA has used its advantage to help   consolidate early leads in core growth markets such as AI   computing platforms and driverless cars. In recent years, NVIDIA   has become the GPU supplier to the AI efforts atMicrosoft,Facebook,Amazon.com,Alphabet, andApple,to name a few. Much has also been made of NVIDIA's potential in   self-driving cars, where it supplies the graphics chips that   power the autonomous-vehicle efforts ofFord,Tesla,Volkswagen,Honda, and many more. Both of these industries figure to offer   substantial growth opportunities over the coming decade, and   NVIDIA's place as the go-to supplier to support these emerging   technologies speaks to their compelling value proposition.Winner: NVIDIA.ValuationThe way the market is pricing Intel and NVIDIA shares should   come as little surprise, given what we just learned about the   outlook for their businesses. Here's a snapshot of three of the   most commonly used valuation metrics for Intel and NVIDIA.CompanyP/EForward P/EEV/EBITDANVIDIA38.329.523.6Intel16.912.37.8Data source: Yahoo! Finance.Both companies also pay dividends: Intel shares currently   yield 2.9%; NVIDIA, a mere 0.5%.As for which stock appears the more attractively valued, I   think both companies appear reasonably valued, given their   respective growth outlooks. The multiple trends fueling NVIDIA's   growth should support its earnings growth for arguably a decade   or more, so its sky-high valuation shouldn't be a deterrent for   investors with a similarly long time horizon.As more of a mature company, Intel will have its investment   outlook driven by its ability to grow its EPS and return excess   capital to shareholders. Its fantastic economics should allow it   to do so, but it's hard to get excited about a company that   analysts see growing sales just 0.9% this year and 2% in   2018. So in terms of which company is more appropriately   valued, I think both companies trade near prices that seem   fair.Winner: Tie.And the winner is... NVIDIA by a noseBoth companies present interesting value propositions to   investors today. Intel offers a mix of profitability and income   at a fairly discounted price, which could prove compelling to   more conservative investors. However, many of NVIDIA's growth   markets are in their early stages, which makes it the more   attractive stock to own over the long term.10 stocks we like better than IntelWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Oracle (ORCL) Stock Spikes on Impressive Q3 Earnings and Cloud Revenues;3/16/2017;"Oracle CorporationORCLis up 7% at $45.94 per share in midday trading on Thursday after posting impressive third quarter earnings yesterday, beating both the Zacks Consensus earnings and revenues estimates.  (To learn more about Oracle's Q3 Earnings, check out this Zacks article:Oracle (ORCL) Beats on Q3 Earnings & Revenues: Stock Up)The California-based company is one of the world's leading suppliers of software for information management and is a new participant in the cloud software service, which is dominated by Amazon.comAMZN, while International Business MachinesIBM, MicrosoftMSFTand GoogleGOOGLare becoming notable competitors.Oracle on Wednesday reported cloud software revenues of $1.1 billion, up 85% compared to the same period a year ago and total revenues were $9.3 billion, up 3%. In dollars, the cloud business grew by almost $500 million year-over-year while the total revenues grew $260 million.The software company's new cloud-computing service has been offsetting the revenue decline in the company's long-time software-licensing operations. Revenues from new software licenses saw a $266 million decline, a 16% fall from a year earlier.""Both our SaaS and PaaS business are doing great, I'm even more excited about our second generation IaaS business,"" said Oracle co-founder and Chief Technology Officer, Larry Ellison. ""Our new Gen2 IaaS is both faster and lower cost than Amazon Web Services.""There is no doubt that Oracle has been investing money to ensure their products and services are in the best shape to compete against powerhouses like Amazon. The operating expenses in cloud software as a service and platform as a service went up by 25% while $4.5 billion were put into research and development for the reported quarter.Despite the impressive growth in its cloud software sector, Oracle is still nowhere near Amazon, who dominates the cloud spaceowning 40% of the cloud market share. However, in February, Oracle altered the terms of its licensing policy to double the cost of running its software in Amazon's cloud environment, reported byMarket Realist.With this move, Oracle took away one of Amazon's cloud service's main selling points, which is the cheaper route to the cloud and presented its own cloud platform as the cheaper option.Oracle reported earnings of $0.63 per share and revenues of $9.27 billion. The company's Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.19 per share of outstanding common stock, up 27% from the current quarterly dividend of $0.15.Oracle expects the fourth quarter of 2017 to be another strong quarter. The cloud software revenue, including SaaS/PaaS and IaaS, with software license and software support is expected to grow 1-3%.Oracle is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) with a Style Score ""A"" in Momentum.More Stock News: 8 Companies Verge on Apple-Like   RunDid you miss Apple's 9X stock explosion after they launched their iPhone in 2007?

Valeant Pharmaceuticals Intl Inc (VRX) Stock: Goodbye, Not Good Buy;3/16/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSome may be tempted to declare ""capitulation!"" inValeant Pharmaceuticals Intl Inc(NYSE:VRX) as one notorious and maligned bull bids farewell. Loathing aside, heavy debt and a burdensome Valeant stock chart suggests bears, not bulls or pigs are still in control of VRX.makeArticleAd();Love him or hate him (and most arguably seem to dislike Bill Ackman), now is not the time to bet against the hedge fund manager and activist investor by picking up Valeant stock.After a very long, painful and much-publicized campaign in shares of VRX, Bill Ackman announced this past Monday night, his hedge fund Pershing Square has exited Valeant Pharmaceuticals.The investment inVRX has been more than an eyesorefor the storied hedge fund manager. Over the past two years, Valeant stock has tanked nearly 95% from the firm's initial purchase price of $190 to $11 a share. Even worse, exiting VRX required a massive liquidation of some 27 million shares. What's more, the Valeant stake represented Pershing Square's most concentrated bet and only magnified the loss, both on and off paper, for Bill Ackman.But love him or hate him, thinking his company's capitulation in Valeant stock, which admittedly required a ""disproportionately"" large amount of firm's resources, means VRX is now free to rally; think again.10 Safe Dividend Stocks to Own During the Next Market CrashThe fact of the matter is Pershing Square decision only came after a substantial year-long commitment to help Valeant sell key assets, establish a new management team and overhaul of the company's board. As well and despite those efforts, there remains $30 billion in under-funded debt obligations.Bottom line, if a storied hedge fund with an otherwise very enviable record of success over the past couple decades can't justify staying the course, though they do have to answer to their dwindling investment base; it's time to face the truth of an equally problematic chart in Valeant stock.Valeant Stock Daily ChartLooking at the daily chart of VRX and it's obvious, to us at least, there have been occasions over the past year where Valeant shares deserved the benefit of the doubt - and even offered decent size, short-term trading profits to bulls.At this point in time though, and without being too pessimistic, it would be hard to defend VRX stock. On a technical basis this week's latest tumble put shares at multiyear lows and pointed towards the financial crisis low of $6.65 - and to be quite honest, maybe much lower in 2017.VRX Stock Bearish Combo SpreadIn reviewing the VRX options board and with shares at $10.96, I like the idea of creating a bearish modified spread. One combo of interest is selling the April $11/$12.50 call vertical and purchasing the April $10 put for even money.If Valeant stock disappoints this bearish trader, the worst case scenario is a loss of $1.50 above $12.50 at expiration. That would require a complete reversal of this week's bearish gap.How to Make Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Pay You High YieldLooking optimistically lower on the price chart, if VRX shares remain wedged between $10 and below $11 a share at expiration, both parts of the combo go out worthless and the trader breaks even. However, an interim move towards the held put could produce paper profits. The position does maintain a bearish delta, or directional bias, when there's still time on the calendar prior to expiration.Lastly, if VRX stock dropped below $10, the combination would begin to trade just like short stock, but without the open-ended risk of that type of position. If that were to happen, I'd look to close the bear call spread and sell a portion of the long put inventory for even money. That adjustment would allow the trader to safely maintain the balance of his or her bearish long put position with no risk.Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in any of the securities or their derivatives mentioned in this article.

Better Buy: Facebook, Inc. vs. Line Corp.;3/16/2017;"They were the largest tech IPOs in the respective years they   went public. They compete head-to-head in what many expect to   emerge as an increasingly important area of consumer tech in   coming years. They're social-media powerhouseFacebook(NASDAQ: FB) and messaging platformLine Corporation(NYSE: LN) .Line made its public debut last July, so the sample size   of its trading history is minuscule. However, in the months since   its IPO, the respective fortunes of Line and Facebook have   diverged to a meaningful degree.makeArticleAd();LNdata byYChartsOf course, this only tells any investor a fraction of what he   or she needs to know. Let's examine three important aspects of   Facebook's and Line's investment narratives, to figure out which   stock is the better buy today.Financial fortitudeThe comparison of financial might between Line and Facebook is   an instance of David versus Goliath. Look at these four important   measures of solvency and liquidity for both companies:CompanyCash and InvestmentsDebtCash From OperationsCurrent RatioFacebook$29.4 billion$0$16.1 billion11.9Line Corp$1.2 billion$0$253.4 billion2.0Data sources: Facebook and Line Corp. investor   relations, Yahoo! Finance.Facebook wins each category by a landslide, but Line is in   fine financial shape. It has no debt, has over $1 billion in the   bank, and produces plenty of spare cash each year. However, the   winner here was inevitable.Winner: Facebook.Image source: Getty Images.Durable competitive advantagesThe size contrast between Facebook and Line continues in   examining their durable competitive advantages.As of its most recent earnings report, Facebook counted 1.86   billion monthly active users (MAUs) on its core social-networking   platform, or about 58% of the world's population that has access   to the internet. Beyond this, Facebook owns other   social-media platforms and messaging services, such as Instagram   (600 million MAUs), Facebook Messenger (1 billion   MAUs), and WhatsApp (1 billion MAUs), that are seeing   large and growing user counts as well. This immense base of users   has allowed Facebook to create the most powerful digital   advertising this side ofAlphabet. Better still, Facebook is moving into emerging areas of   technology, including virtual reality, artificial intelligence,   live digital video streaming, and much more. Facebook, in short,   has quickly ascended to become one of the most important   technology companies on the face of the earth.Line, on the other hand, is far smaller. As of its most recent   earnings report, the company counted 217 million monthly active   users on its messaging platform, though 76% of its users are   concentrated in just four core markets: Japan, Thailand, Taiwan,   and Indonesia. Worse, its user growth declined sequentially from   220 million in its Q3 report, suggesting that Line may be   feeling pressure from larger global messaging platforms -- like   the ones Facebook owns. The company has moved aggressively to   monetize its users through products such as paid stickers, games,   and a host of other mobile apps, but the jury remains out on   whether Line can translate its regional strength in messaging   into a sustainable long-term business. Compared with Facebook,   it's clear which company enjoys more substantial durable   competitive advantages.Winner: Facebook.ValuationA meaningful gap exists between Facebook's and Line's   valuations, and for good reason. First, look at three of the most   commonly used valuation metrics for both companies:CompanyP/EForward P/EEV/EBITDAFacebook39.120.424.7Line Corp.111.834.634.3Data source: Yahoo! Finance.Again, Facebook beats Line across all three valuation   statistics. Comparing this performance to their projected future   growth rates, analysts estimate that Facebook's earnings per   share will grow at an average annual rate of 23.5% over the next   five years, versus 39.3% for Line -- which has only one sell-side   analyst covering its stock at the moment. I think the key   question here is to what extent investors believe in Line's   monetization capabilities. If Line can indeed grow its EPS at   such above-average rates, Line shares could do quite well.   However, the cracks that have emerged in its user growth story   give me pause. So let's call this section a draw and move on.Winner: Tie.And the winner is... FacebookFacebook remains undeniably stronger than Line, even factoring   in Line's higher estimated future growth rates. The Asian   messaging platform still has plenty of questions to answer about   whether it can continue to expand its uses. On the other hand,   Facebook is one of the most powerful and iconic companies in all   of tech. It stands as the better buy between the two today.10 stocks we like better than FacebookWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

How to Make Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Pay You High Yield;3/16/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe Nasdaq-100 is posting new highs, and it's being led higher by companies likeAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL). To most traders, though, it would seem like it's too late to initiate a long position in GOOGL stock by purchasing shares at $870.makeArticleAd();Luckily, you and I have the options markets.With GOOGL options, we can design trades that allow for a margin of error. That would give us a lot more confidence going forward; otherwise, our stops would kick in on the first few red days.Less than 30 days ago, I shared atrade that was designed to be a sure thing. Almost $4 per contract in profits came fast. Today, with those profits in my pocket, I want to ""range trade"" Alphabet stock instead. We could all use a little speculative risk in our portfolio.The short story of Alphabet is that fundamentally it's as solid as it gets. It's the king of search, and that's a cash cow that just keeps getting fatter. So with a trailing price-to-earnings ratio of 30, GOOGL's potential is built in somewhat … but I think it's not fully built in. I think what people are forgetting is that Alphabet can still monetize the billions of users on the Android OS much better than it already is.Click to EnlargeTechnically speaking, Alphabet stock is at all-time highs, but still has room to run. I'd just expect some resistance first.How GoPro Inc (GPRO) Stock Could Stage a ComebackFor now, then, this is what we'll do.How to Trade GOOGL StockThe bullish side:Sell the GOOGL 13 Apr $845/$842.5 credit put spread for 40 cents per contract. We have an 80% chance that price will stay above my strike where we need it.The bearish side:Sell the GOOGL 13 Apr $887.5/$890 credit call spread for an additional 60 cents per contract. Here, given the upside potential in markets, our chances of success are around 75%.Taking both trades would constitute a sold iron condor for a total $1 in credit. Since we can only lose on one side or the other, our max risk drops, thereby raising my potential yield above 60% on risk. This trade's delta is much higher than my usual points of entry, and that's what makes it a speculative setup in GOOGL stock.In this market, I know we'll need to tightly manage this iron condor. So we shouldn't risk more money than we can afford to lose.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director ofSellSpreads.com.

An Uber IPO Will Be a Down Round;3/16/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAmong venture capitalists a ""down round"" is defined as funding in a private company that carries a lower valuation than the previous investment.makeArticleAd();It means a company's investors are taking a loss. That's what is likely to happen whenUbergoes public.Right now,Uber is said to be worth $69 billionafter taking losses of $2.2 billion during the first nine months of 2016. Its 2016 revenues were estimated at $5.5 billion, and it is not unusual for fast-growing companies to sustain losses as they invest to keep the growth going.Valuing a company at 12.5 times revenue when it seems to be at the peak of its performance may seem to make sense for wealthy Silicon Valley investors, but here in the real world, we have a word for that kind of offer, and the word is no.Trouble Ahead, Trouble Behind for UberUber drivers are not employees. They are, in theory, business partners who pay Uber a commission to bring them work driving people around.They are unlicensed taxi driverswho don't pay for medallions and are thus subject to harassment by the government.10 Safe Dividend Stocks to Own During the Next Market CrashBut the Uber drivers I have met are incredibly professional, and their cars are clean, thanks in part to a""Vehicle Solutions""program that lets them rent, lease or buy new or nearly new cars. This is how the company has grown.But relying on contractors carriesrisks. Uber is said to have a""toxic""work culture,one rife with sexual abuse, leading to aTwitter Inc(NYSE:TWTR) campaign advocating thatcustomers delete the app.CEO Travis Kalanick described his corporate culture as""baller,""and once joked to a magazine thatcalling the company ""Boober""was fine because it got him sex.Pando Dailyfounder Sarah Lacy has beenan especially harsh critic, and political polarization now seems to be having an effect, as rivalLyfthas reportedly grown7%in just the last two months, although both companies have seenless traffic lately.Self-Driving MessFor investors, Uber's biggest risk may lie in its efforts to get into the self-driving car business.Alphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG), the parent of Google andWaymo, a self-driving car pioneer, has filed a legal complaint charging thatUber stole Waymo's trade secretsby having an employee walk out with them, founding a company called Otto, then buying Otto for $700 million. If Alphabet wins the case, it could take Uber completely out of that business.Uber is also challenging Google Maps,pushing its own system on drivers, one that will make their driving fit corporate needs. It also gives the company a direct online connection to drivers.Uber's fraught relations with competitors, drivers and government is nowa global phenomenon. Competition from new entrants is also increasing, even in Africa.The Bottom LineBuying Uber stock is based on a belief that the company will grow, but it's more likely that Uber is now at the replacement end of the curve, where growth slows down.Buying Uber in hopes of getting into the self-driving ""cars as a service"" craze is also risky, because Uber's ownership of the necessary intellectual property is under question.Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Is Flying High, But Don't Go Contrarian Yet!The risk of venture capitalists holding companies through their period of maximum growth is always that they will hold on too long, that they will be unable to exit the investment on their own timetable - that they will, in the end, get too greedy.That's what has happened here. When Uber goes public, wait for all lock-up periods to expire before considering an investment. See what its full value is before you buy. Don't bet on the hype of the IPO.

Google Home Is Catching Up to Amazon's Echo;3/16/2017;"Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) had a surprise hit on its hand with the Echo smart   speaker. After releasing it exclusively to Prime members in late   2014, the device proved so popular that Amazon was able to   quickly open orders to everyone in the U.S. by the following   summer. On Christmas Eve of 2015, the Echo was one of the top   five items ordered, according to Amazon's annual holiday press   release. Last year, Echo device sales climbed nine times compared   to 2015's holiday season.That's despite the November introduction of Google Home, a   competing smart speaker from theAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) subsidiary. During Alphabet's   fourth-quarter earnings call, RBC analyst Mark Mahaney suggested   Echo devices, powered by the virtual assistant Alexa, outsold   Google Home 10-to-1 in the quarter.But Mahaney is changing his tune after conducting a more   in-depth survey. ""Home's awareness and installed base could be   much closer to Alexa -- with a brand awareness in the U.S. 80%   that of Alexa and an installed base that may be close to a third   that of Alexa,"" he recently wrote in a note.makeArticleAd();It looks like Google Home is quickly catching up to Amazon's   Echo.Image source: Google.Google plans to keep investing in Google HomeGoogle plans to keep making Google Home a better device by   improving its search capabilities and functionality. ""We are   going to invest a lot in it over 2017,"" Google CEO Sundar Pichai   told investors on Alphabet's fourth-quarter earnings call. ""I   think there is a lot of work ahead to make all of this work well   for users. And this is the core area where we've invested in for   the very long term,"" he added.Google intends to leverage its massive Android platform to   continue improving Google Assistant, the artificial intelligence   (AI) behind Google Home. At least 200 million devices will have   access to the voice assistant, which will provide Google with a   lot more opportunities to learn exactly what people are looking   for when they say, ""OK, Google.""Google will also have to improve Google Home's capabilities.   The device currently has around 80 Actions, which is nothing   compared to the 10,000-plus functionalities available with Alexa.   To that end, Google launched the Actions on Google developer kit   in December.Strategy Analytics estimates Google will sell 1 million Google   Home devices by midyear. That still trails Amazon's sales by a   significant margin. The research group estimates Amazon sold 6.3   million Echo devices last year, and that should go up   meaningfully in 2017. Mahaney estimates Amazon will sell 60   million Echo devices by 2020, bringing the install base to 128   million.Google still doesn't know how to monetize voice searchWhile Google Home sales are improving relative to Amazon Echo,   it's not clear device sales will follow a similar path. Google   Home lacks one of the key functionalities of Amazon's devices:   the ability to easily shop on Amazon.Seventeen percent of Echo owners use Alexa to place orders on   Amazon, according to Mahaney's survey. As the number of devices   in use grows, Mahaney expects the amount of shopping done via   Alexa on Amazon to grow as well. By 2020, sales through the voice   assistant could reach $5 billion, according to the analyst's   estimate.Google doesn't even have a business model for monetizing   Google Home beyond hardware sales. Search and display ads don't   work very well on a device with no display.Moreover, Google doesn't offer a compelling differentiating   factor for consumers to pick its device over another smart   speaker. Comparatively, Amazon Prime members, of which there'sa rapidly growing number, have lots of reasons to pick the Echo, like easy access to   ordering things on Amazon or inexpensive use of Amazon Music   Unlimited.As such, Amazon is poised to win the long-term competition   even if Google Home is catching up in the short term.10 stocks we like better than AlphabetWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

In other words, Q1 estimates have come down, but they haven't come down by as much.At the sector level, ten of the 16 Zacks sectors are expected to earn more relative to the year-earlier period, with earnings growth for the Technology sector expected to be up +10.2% from the same period last year. The sector is expecting strong earnings growth despite the relatively flattish expectation fromApple(NASDAQ:AAPL-Free Report). Strong growth atAlphabet(NASDAQ:GOOGL-Free Report),Facebook(NASDAQ:FB-Free Report) and easy comparisons atMicron(NASDAQ:MU-Free Report) are the big positive contributors to the sector. Earnings growth for the Finance, Basic Materials and Industrials sectors are expected to be in mid-single digits while the Energy sector moves from a modest loss in the year-earlier period to improving positive earnings this quarter.If you want an email notification each time Sheraz Mian publishes a new article, pleaseclick here>>>About Zacks Equity ResearchZacks Equity Research provides the best of quantitative and qualitative analysis to help investors know what stocks to buy and which to sell for the long-term.Continuous analyst coverage is provided for a universe of 1,150 publicly traded stocks.

Twitter's (TWTR) Prominent Accounts Hacked, Shares Fall;3/16/2017;"makeZacksArticleAd();Reportedly,Twitter IncTWTRwas in for a rude shock after some of its high profile accounts were hacked and used to post tweets in favor of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Shares went down nearly 2% to $15.03 yesterday.Per reports, the accounts were not hacked from the main platform but from Twitter Counter, an Amsterdam based third party statistics service for Twitter. Some of the prominent accounts hacked included pop sensation Justin Bieber's Japan account, BBC North America, Reuters Japan, Forbes, UNICEF, Duke University, Amnesty International and Starbucks Argentina. Tweets filled with swastika (Nazi symbol) and hashtags like ""NaziGermany"" and ""NaziHolland"" were sent from these compromised accounts.Currently, it is uncertain as to who carried out this mass hacking.Turkey/Netherlands Face-offPer media reports, Turkey and Netherlands are embroiled in a political spat ever since the latter barred Turkish ministers from attending a political rally in the country ahead of a referendum in Turkey. The rally was organized to gain support for Erdogan. Turkey is drawing up a new constitution that will significantly enhance the President's power and make the post of prime minister and vice president redundant. The referendum is scheduled to take place on Apr 16.Following the treatment meted out to its ministers, Turkey has ""suspended high level ties"" with Netherlands as well as barred the Dutch ambassador from returning to Ankara. It has also labeled Dutch action as ""Nazi tactics"".Twitter, Inc. PriceTwitter, Inc. Price|Twitter, Inc. QuoteTwitter's Trolling Trouble & MoreAnalysts observe that this incident is unlikely to cause much damage to Twitter but the increase in these types of occurrences (hacking, fake news & hate speech) can prove detrimental.  Social media sites have come under tremendous scrutiny following the U.S presidential elections in 2016. FacebookFBand Twitter were accused of disseminating fake news resulting in surprising election results.Rising concerns have also come from Germany as the Social Democrat Party, reportedly, said it will fine social media companies 50 million euros ($53 million) for their inability to contain a hoax.  Since the beginning of the year, German intelligence agencies have been on their toes as there are chances that fake news will alter election results. Reportedly, Buzzfeed has found that there are several fake reports on Facebook about Angela Merkel, who is campaigning for the fourth term as the chancellor.Twitter has been trying to contain the trolling menace that has plagued its platform for long now and possibly kept potential users as well as buyers at bay.Apart from taking down accounts of offenders, Twitter also announced several measures to combat trolling. The company has improvised the ""mute"" button, which will enable users to block tweets that include objectionable words, phrases and conversations. Plus, it has empowered users by giving them a ""more direct way of reporting"" hateful conduct. Twitter users can now report any hateful conduct that they come across on the platform. Per Twitter, this ""helps reduce the burden on the person experiencing the abuse, and helps to strengthen a culture of collective support on Twitter."" The company said that it is also ""retraining"" its staff to better tackle abusive behavior on the platform.Twitter cannot afford more troubles as it passes through one of the toughest phases in its corporate history. User growth is sluggish and advertising revenues are decelerating. Amid this entire fracas, the exodus of high profile executives continues. In the past one year, Twitter shares declined 10.18%, as against 8.57% rise in the ZacksInternet Softwareindustry. Its CEO, Jack Dorsey's focus on ""live"" and user friendly changes hasn't yet moved the needle for Twitter.To top it, the widely expected takeover didn't materialize, with interested parties like AlphabetGOOGL, Salesforce and The Walt Disney CompanyDISpulling out last minute, given the challenges that Twitter faces alongside trolling.At present, Twitter carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Sound The Alarm, ALRM is Headed Higher;3/15/2017;"makeZacksArticleAd();Get ready for some upward revisions to the earnings estimates ofAlarm.com( ALRM).  The stock is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now but reported earnings after the close on Wednesday, March 15.  The company posted revenues of $69.79M compared to the consensus of $63.95M.  EPS of $0.19 was $0.06 better than the Wall Street consensus estimate.In the release, the company guided Wall Street higher.  FY2017 is now expected to produce revenue of between $322M to $325.5M and that is comfortably higher than the $300M consensus estimate.  The company expects to earn $0.73 to $0.75 for the year and that is also above the $0.65 consensus estimate.In late after hours trading, I see the stock at $33.39 up $2.76 or about 9%.Estimates Likely Moving HigherWhen a company raises guidance over the consensus you can expect the analysts to adjust their models.  These models help them derive their earnings estimates which are used in the Zacks Rank.  Since there haven't been any earnings revisions over the last 60 days, ALRM is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).  In the coming days I anticipate the stock to see several upward revisions which should help boost the Zacks Rank for this stock to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) or a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).AcquisitionsALRM made a few recent acquisitions and they were touched on during the conference call.  During the call, management talked about how the ObjectVideo acquisition will allow customers to track cars and license plates or even customers in a store.The Icontrol Networks deal closed in the quarter and the company mentioned how the Piper unit powers a portion of the ADT platform.  The industry had been viewed as ""we versus ADT"" but that has changed with the advent of customer home protection services offered by cable companies.An analyst questioned if the company was looking to a product offering around cars, and while the company would not commit on a specific answer, it was clear that it could be something coming down the road.  Many times during the call management noted that they were maintaining a healthy level of spending for R&D.  Having an expandable platform is key because the security business has been changing very rapidly.Follow Brian Bolan on Twitter @BBolan1OutlookAs we think about the changes in home security, it is clear that people are adding devices and services thanks to the relative ease of the internet.  Management noted on the call that people want these products and services to come from one source.As an example, I have a Google Cam (formerly Dropcam) and while it is accessible via its own app I would like to see it be usable via my Amazon echo.  Yes the Google Nest is controllable via the voice recognizing tool, but I would like more functionality.  I often search on Amazon for devices that are compatible with Alexa since I have power out that is controlled by another company.  It too has its own app and with only a few devices having multiple apps is already a pressure point for me.With the strong revenue guidance, management believes that its products and services will be well received by customers.Analysts Notes ComingAs I look at where most recommendations are, I see a few potential upgrades tomorrow.  Goldman Sachs started coverage of the stock with a Neutral rating on January 31 and a $31 price target. The analyst for the firm asked about the potential for organic growth from Icontrol which allowed management to talk about how they were going to hold their cost structure constant and could expect about $66M in EBITDA which translates to better than 20% margin.  It is possible that Goldman Sachs ups the stock to ""Buy"" tomorrow.Raymond James downgraded the stock back on August 16 as the moved their rating to Market Perform from Outperform.  Imperial Capital has the stock as ""In-line"" with a $30 price target.Roth Capital started coverage on October 3 with a buy and a $33.50 price target.  Don't be surprised to see that price target moved to $37.50 range.Maxim Group initiated with a buy rating and $37 price target on December 1.  They are clearly the most bullish on the stock and for good reason.  I would look for the Maxim price target to expand to $40 or more given the recently posted results.Trading Range?The stock has a 52 week high of $34.43, but don't be too surprised to see a new level reached tomorrow.  Why do I say this?  Well back on October 31, 2016 some unusual call buying was spotted in ALRM.  The call was a $35 strike with a March expiration.  At the time, the stock was $29 and change so it was a pretty big reach.  I see those same calls closing at $0.17 with open interest of 856 - so not anything to get too excited about.What did catch my eye on the option chain was all the puts that moved the day of earnings.  The 27.5 strike that expires on Friday saw 729 contracts vs open interest of 898.  Check that open interest level tomorrow to see if those were all premium sellers as the put was paying $0.42.I like the chances of several price target increases coming tomorrow.  There is an outside chance we get an upgrade on the stock as well.  Throw in the idea that some mildly aggressive calls were bought several months ago I and I like the chances of this stock trading over $35 on March 16 or soon thereafter.  Either way, look for this stock to become a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) in a day or two.Alarm.com Holdings, Inc. Price and ConsensusAlarm.com Holdings, Inc.

What Will the Q1 Earnings Season Bring?;3/15/2017;"makeZacksArticleAd();Note: The following is an excerpt from this week'sEarnings Trendsreport. You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actuals and estimates for the current and following periods,please click here>>>The Q1 earnings season will follow a strong showing in the preceding reporting cycle, with growth reaching its highest level in two years and the overall quarterly earnings tally reaching a new quarterly record. The market will be looking for continuation of these favorable trends in the Q1 reporting cycle as well, which has (officially) gotten underway already but wouldn't be in the spotlight for another four weeks.Total Q1 earnings are expected to be up +6.4% from the same period last year on +6.5% higher revenues. This would follow +7.1% earnings growth in 2016 Q4 on +4.4% top-line gains, the highest growth pace in two years.Estimates for Q1 came down as the quarter unfolded, with the current +6.4% growth down from +10.4% at the end of December. The chart below shows how Q1 earnings growth expectations have evolved over the last three months.Please note that while Q1 estimates have followed a well traversed path that we have been seeing consistently over the last few years, the magnitude of negative revisions compares favorably to other periods. In other words, Q1 estimates have come down, but they haven't come down by as much.At the sector level, ten of the 16 Zacks sectors are expected to earn more relative to the year-earlier period, with earnings growth for the Technology sector expected to be up +10.2% from the same period last year. The sector is expecting strong earnings growth despite the relatively flattish expectation fromApple(AAPL). Strong growth atAlphabet(GOOGL),Facebook(FB) and easy comparisons atMicron(MU) are the big positive contributors to the sector. Earnings growth for the Finance, Basic Materials and Industrials sectors are expected to be in mid-single digits while the Energy sector moves from a modest loss in the year-earlier period to improving positive earnings this quarter.The chart below shows current consensus growth expectations for the following quarters, which reflect a continuation of the positive growth trend going forward.Please note that we have yet to see any 'Trump bump' in estimates along the lines of what we have been seeing in the market since November 8th. The sole exception to that comment would be the Finance sector whose earnings outlook has benefited from the post-election uptrend in interest rates.Note: Sheraz Mian manages the Zacks equity research department.

This would follow +7.1% earnings growth in 2016 Q4 on +4.4% top-line gains, the highest growth pace in two years.Estimates for Q1 came down as the quarter unfolded, with the current +6.4% growth down from +10.4% at the end of December. The chart below shows how Q1 earnings growth expectations have evolved over the last three months.Please note that while Q1 estimates have followed a well traversed path that we have been seeing consistently over the last few years, the magnitude of negative revisions compares favorably to other periods. In other words, Q1 estimates have come down, but they haven't come down by as much.At the sector level, ten of the 16 Zacks sectors are expected to earn more relative to the year-earlier period, with earnings growth for the Technology sector expected to be up +10.2% from the same period last year. The sector is expecting strong earnings growth despite the relatively flattish expectation fromApple(AAPL). Strong growth atAlphabet(GOOGL),Facebook(FB) and easy comparisons atMicron(MU) are the big positive contributors to the sector. Earnings growth for the Finance, Basic Materials and Industrials sectors are expected to be in mid-single digits while the Energy sector moves from a modest loss in the year-earlier period to improving positive earnings this quarter.The chart below shows current consensus growth expectations for the following quarters, which reflect a continuation of the positive growth trend going forward.Please note that we have yet to see any 'Trump bump' in estimates along the lines of what we have been seeing in the market since November 8th. The sole exception to that comment would be the Finance sector whose earnings outlook has benefited from the post-election uptrend in interest rates.Note: Sheraz Mian manages the Zacks equity research department.

Twitter, Inc. Is Missing Out on This Major Catalyst;3/15/2017;"Twitter(NYSE:TWTR) has undoubtedly missed the mark recently. Last year, the social   network's sequential monthly active user growth stalled and even   temporarily turned negative. Meanwhile, Twitter's revenue growth   rates have decelerated rapidly and its stock price has plummeted   nearly 70% in two years.Going further, there isn't a clear end in sight to Twitter's   revenue challenges. A new report by research company eMarketer   (viaRecode) forecasts Twitter's U.S. mobile ad revenue will actually   decline in 2017 compared to 2016 asFacebook(NASDAQ: FB) andAlphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google gobble up marketers'   rising spending on mobile advertisements.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();Twitter's missed opportunityIn 2017, Twitter's U.S. mobile advertising revenue will   decline from $1.21 billion last year to $1.15 billion, eMarketer   estimates. A quick glance at Twitter's financials in the   company's most recent quarter suggests this estimate is   realistic. Twitter's $382 million in U.S. advertising revenue in   Q4 was down 7% from the year-ago period. And given that 89% of   Twitter's global ad revenue during the quarter came from mobile,   it's safe to say that Twitter's mobile ad revenue in the U.S.   probably isn't faring too well.What's unfortunate about Twitter's struggling mobile ad   business in the U.S. is that it's happening at a time when   marketers are spending more on mobile ads. Total mobile ad spend   in the U.S. is expected to increase 25% in 2017 compared to 2016,   eMarketer estimates.Unlike Twitter, advertising juggernauts Google and Facebook   are well-positioned to snap-up this incremental spending. The two   companies' combined share of U.S. mobile ad spend will increase   from 54% in 2016 to 57% in 2017, eMarketer estimates. But   eMarketer estimates that Twitter's share of U.S. mobile   advertising revenue will decline from 2.6% in 2016 to 2% in   2017.Twitter management likely agrees that it won't be keeping up   with Google's or Facebook's growth rate in 2017. In the company's   fourth-quarter shareholder letter, management said, ""escalating   competition for digital ad spending"" could present challenges for   advertising revenue growth in 2017.Image source: Twitter.Can Twitter reinvigorate growth?Looking further into the future -- perhaps toward the end of   2017 and into 2018 -- Twitter's domestic advertising revenue   could start growing again. Management believes that the company's   recentreaccelerationin user growth will drive revenue growth. But it's going to take   time as management expects ""advertising revenue growth to   continue to lag that of audience growth in 2017,"" the company   explained in its fourth-quarter shareholder letter.But if Twitter does return to mobile ad growth in the U.S.   toward the end of the year or in 2018, don't expect growth rates   to be very high. Not only may overall growth in U.S.-based mobile   ad spend be much slower by then, but Twitter's anemic 3%   year-over-year growth in U.S. monthly active users during the   company's most recent quarter -- notably below Facebook's 5.5%   year-over-year growth in U.S. monthly active users in the same   period -- suggests the user growth won't be much help for Twitter   in driving domestic ad revenue growth.10 stocks we like better than TwitterWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock       tip, it can pay to listen.

Genpact (G) Acquires Rage Frameworks to Boost AI Offerings;3/15/2017;"Genpact LimitedGrecently announced plans to acquire Rage Frameworks, a Dedham-based artificial intelligence (AI) startup. The acquisition is expected to boost its AI technology platform targeting enterprises. However, the terms of the deal were not disclosed.We note that the two companies have partnered many times in the past to cater to clients in the financial services and insurance sectors.With this acquisition, Genpact will be able to provide AI offerings across industries such as consumer packaged goods, industrial engineering, life-sciences and high-tech.Genpact Limited Price and ConsensusGenpact Limited Price and Consensus|Genpact Limited QuoteWhy this Move?As per an IDC report, worldwide spending on cognitive systems and AI is estimated to go past $47 billion by 2020 at a CAGR of 55.1%. Given the huge scope the segment has to offer, it is not surprising to see a number of companies flocking to the scene.Apart from IBM'sIBMWatson, Google'sGOOGLDeep Mind, Microsoft'sMSFTCortana and Apple's Siri, there are some rookies in the industry too such as AIBrain, Anki and Entefy that are trying to carve a niche in the segment.With this acquisition, we expect Genpact to better position itself in the enterprise AI space, resulting in greater adoption for its services. Also, the company's thorough domain expertise is a positive, helping it to generate enhanced actionable insights for enterprises.Moreover, Rage Frameworks has a commendable portfolio of 20 ""intelligent machines"", which can streamline an enterprise's business processes such as contract reviews and supply chain cost audits. These will help Genpact to offer customized solutions.Stock Performance OverviewShares of Genpact have largely underperformed the ZacksOutsourcingindustry over the last one year.

Snap Inc's (SNAP) Revenue Forecast Slashed, Shares Fall;3/15/2017;"As per research firm, eMarketer,Snap Inc.'sSNAPad revenues for the current year are projected to be $770 million, $30 million less than the earlier estimate (Sep 2016), due to ""higher-than-estimated revenue sharing with partners."" Despite the slash, revenues are still expected to be up 157.8% from last year.Following the news, Snap shares were down 2.4% in the session before closing at $20.58. Though Snap had a spectacular debut, rising 44% on the first day of trading, it has not been able to keep up the momentum. In the last few days, shares fell below its IPO price amid bearish reports by analysts.Citing instances of TwitterTWTRand many others, analysts believe that Snap ""will follow a pattern of hot, then cooling, tech IPOs.""They argue that Snap has already started seeing its average daily user growth rate slow down.  Plus, it is yet to make profits. Though the company's revenues are on the rise, losses are ballooning. Per reports, in 2016, Snap's revenues of $404.5 million were nearly six times higher than 2015 revenues but net loss for the year increased 38% to $514.6 million.Moreover, since Snapchat has just one source of revenues i.e., advertising, which only began in Oct 2016, it may be a concern for investors. Also, it attracts a particular segment of the demography.Analysts argue that teens are inclined to sudden changes in preferences. Media reports have quoted Snap ""admitting"" that increasing competition from big players like Facebook Inc.FB, which have better resources, are a big threat as they can easily lure users to their platform.At present, Facebook has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank   (Strong Buy) stocks here.Plus, Snap's valuation is nosebleed. At nearly 60 times its revenues, analysts remain wary as it is too high, given its existing and future growth prospects.Snap Inc. PriceSnap Inc. Price|Snap Inc. QuoteOther Snippets from the ReportIn its report, eMarketer further added that U.S digital ad spending will grow 15.9% to $83 billion with Alphabet'sGOOGLGoogle accounting for 40.7% of the ad revenues. Also, Google will lead search market revenues with 78% share of the domestic search ad revenues. For the year, Google's search revenues are expected to be up 16% to $28.55 billion.On the other hand, Facebook's share of the total U.S ad digital spend will be much less than that of Google. However, Facebook continues to net the biggest domestic revenue share of the display business. In 2017, Facebook's display business will likely grow 32.1% to $16.33 billion, representing 39.1% of the total display market. Instagram has emerged as an important cash cow and will contribute 20% of Facebook's U.S. mobile revenue as against 15% reported last year.While Snapchat is still a very small player with just 1.3% revenue share of the total domestic mobile ad market expected this year, the same is expected to grow to 2.7% in 2019, per eMarketer.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric   Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

4 Stocks That Can Rival Intel in the Driverless Car Market;3/15/2017;"Intel Corp'sINTCrecently announced plan to acquire Israel-based Mobileye will improve its competitive position in the fast growing driverless car market. The $15 billion deal, which many analysts believe is steep as Intel is paying a whopping 34% premium, will aid the company seize a portion of the market estimated to be worth $25 billion annually by 2025, as per consulting firm Bain & Company.makeArticleAd();According to Boston Consulting Group estimates, the autonomous car market will be worth $42 billion by 2025 and $77 billion by 2035. Per market research firm IHS, autonomous car sales will hit 21 million by 2035, growing at a CAGR of 43% over 2025-2035 time frame. In the U.S. the figure is anticipated to be 4.5 million autonomous vehicles by 2035.The massive growth prospect of the self-driving car market has not only lured semiconductor companies like Intel, QualcommQCOMand NVIDIANVDAbut also hardcore technology companies like AlphabetGOOGLand AppleAAPLto foray into the market. Cab-aggregators Uber, Lyft, search-engine Baidu, Microsoft as well as auto-makers General Motors, Ford and Volkswagen are prominent names flocking to capitalize on this highly lucrative opportunity.The robust growth in number of autonomous vehicles deployed in streets will surely escalate demand for sensor technology and auto components (chips, electronic circuits, algorithms) that support advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), the basic building block for self-driving cars. This is a significant boost for semiconductor companies.As per J.P. Morgan, the estimated total available market for semiconductors used in semiautonomous and fully autonomous cars will reach about $7.3 billion by 2025, a CAGR of approximately 62.5% starting in 2017.Moreover, the massive data generated by these autonomous vehicles related to road conditions, accident prone zones, location mapping, weather report, as well as user preferences during the driving (privacy issues notwithstanding) will actually be a much prized resource for companies, which they can monetize later.How Mobileye Benefits Intel?The driverless market is lucrative for Intel as it faces declining growth in core PC and data center markets. The latest acquisition will help Intel to rapidly penetrate the ADAS market. (Read More:Intel to Expand in Automated Car Space with Stake in HERE)We note that Intel a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, has underperformed the ZacksSemiconductor Generalindustry, in the last one year. While the stock has gained 11%, the industry witnessed an increase of 44.5% over the same time frame.Currently, Mobileye's sensor technology is used by a number of automakers like General Motors, Audi, BMW and Ford. Intel will definitely benefit from these partnerships with the leading automakers.In Jul, 2016, the company along with Mobileye and BMW announced a collaboration to manufacture self-driving cars for streets by 2021. The companies plan to put a fleet of 40 self-driving BMW cars on the street by the end of 2017. It has also signed partnership deal with Delphi Automotive.Competition Heats Up: 4 RivalsAlthough the acquisition gives Intel a slight edge, we believe that NVIDIA, Alphabet, Qualcomm, and Apple are close on heels:NVIDIA- A Zacks Rank #3 stock, NVIDIA's approach is more focused on the artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning part of the driverless market. The company's powerful graphic processor units (GPUs) are supporting the endeavors.NVIDIA's collaborations with HERE (Intel has a stake in this company) and ZENRIN expand the Live Map capabilities of autonomous vehicles. The company's collaboration with Honda, Tesla Motors, Audi, Volvo, Mercedes-Benz and BMW makes it a formidable force in the driverless car market. (Read More:NVIDIA or Intel: Which Is Better for Driverless Car Investors?)Moreover, the upcoming third generation Xavier supercomputer chip leverages NVIDIA's position in the driverless car market going ahead. (Read More:Will NVIDIA Stock Benefit from Intel's Acquisition of Mobileye?)Alphabet- This Zacks Rank #3 stock was really the primary aggressor among the technology companies in the driverless car market. Alphabet, then Google, unveiled the first fully operational driverless car way back in 2010. The recently created Waymo now primarily focuses on developing the applications and technology that drive these cars, whether for ride-sharing or personal use. (Read More:Google Finds 'Waze' to Build Self-Driving Technology)Alphabet has also partnered with Fiat Chrysler under which Google will incorporate its self-driving technology into 100 Chrysler Pacifica minivans to be used as test vehicles. Separately, Google and Ford Motor have partnered to lead a coalition of companies that will push for federal approval of autonomous cars in the near future.We also believe that Alphabet's expertise in data collecting, storing and monetizing makes it a formidable opponent of Intel in the autonomous driving market.Qualcomm- Another Zacks Rank #3 stock, the company's partnership with the likes of OnStar and TomTom are helping it to penetrate the driverless car market. Qualcomm's drive data platform ""is designed to intelligently collect and analyze information from a vehicle's sensors."" The company has partnered with Volkswagen for current and future autonomous driving vehicles.Moreover, the acquisition of NXP Semiconductors will boost Qualcomm's presence in the connectivity market. (Read More:Qualcomm Moves Closer to Acquiring NXP Semiconductors)Apple- Perhaps the most secretive challenger, the iPhone-maker has acknowledged its interest in autonomous driving. The company has been investing heavily in machine learning and automation. For years, the company has been rumored to work on self-driving Project Titan and has also hired executives from Tesla Motors and other automakers. The company carries a Zacks Rank #3.

Should You Buy Twilio Inc (TWLO) Stock? 3 Pros, 3 Cons;3/15/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe deflation of theTwilio Inc(NYSE:TWLO) IPO has certainly been stunning. The company pulled off its offering in June at $15 a share and within a few months, the price hit a nose-bleed $69. But then there was an avalanche of selling with Twilio stock. As of now, the price is at $31.makeArticleAd();Source:Web Summit Via FlickrDespite all this, TWLO has continued to grow at a rapid pace. In the latestquarter, the revenues jumped by 60% to $82 million, as the number of active customer accounts went from 34,457 to 36,606.In fact, Twilio beat the Street consensus. The company also forecasted that the growth ramp would continue throughout the year.But it was not enough to get TWLO stock back into gear. For the most part, Twilio stock has been trading in a tight range.So might there be an opportunity? Perhaps TWLO stock has bottomed out and is poised for a move on the upside? Well, to see, let's take a look at three pros and three cons:Three Pros to Twilio StockPowerful Platform: TWLO has a suite of powerful cloud-based applications, allowing for SMS, chat, voice calling and video. A developer can easily embed this technology into an app, providing access to a sophisticated communications network.7 High-Yield Dividend Stocks That Are Actually SafeThe business model is also enticing. That is, payments are only required when there is usage of the Twilio service.As a result, the company has been able to quickly attract developers. Note that there are over 1 million accounts.Going Upmarket: TWLO has an Enterprise Plan, which is focused on large customers that have tough requirements for compliance, security and administration. A key part of this was the recent granting of ISO 27001 certification, which is a global standard for security.While still in the early stages, the Enterprise Plan is showing encouraging results. For example, in the latest quarter TWLO snagged a major airline as well asCapital One Financial Corp. (NYSE:COF) and the Blue Cross Blue Shield companies.According to CEO Jeff Lawson, on the most recentearnings call: ""We are seeing really good response in terms of the enterprise. Again, I would say this is our developer first model at play where developers are the ones bringing Twilio into the enterprise just like they've brought us into a number of different types of technology first companies.""Growth Opportunity: Companies like Uber,Alphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG,NASDAQ:GOOGL) andAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) have raised the bar when it comes to apps and cloud technologies. Customers have come to expect that they can get quick service with just a few taps.This is where TWLO is so powerful. The company's systems can easily allow for must-have features to remain competitive.So in light of this, it should be no surprise that the market opportunity for Twilio stock is enormous. According toresearch from IDC, it's estimated at about $45.4 billion.Three Cons to Twilio StockCompetition: It's certainly fierce. Just some of the rivals includeCisco Systems, Inc.(NASDAQ:CSCO),Vonage Holdings Corp.(NYSE:VG), CallFire, Nexmo and Bandwidth.com. In fact, some of TWLO's own customers could wind up being competitors, such asFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB). And telecom operators likeAT&T Inc.(NYSE:T) andVerizon Communications Inc.(NYSE:VZ) could leverage their own networks to take on TWLO.Granted, the low-price strategy of the company has probably been a key in maintaining marketshare. But then again, this may make it tough for it to ultimately get to profitability on a GAAP basis.Customer Concentration: It is fairly heavy. Last year about 30% of revenues came from only 10 customers. Keep in mind that FB's WhatsApp represented 9% and Uber was over 10%. It's important to note that TWLO also generally allows customers to terminate their contracts at any time.What Will Apple Inc. (AAPL) Show Off in Its April Event?Now this is not to say that these customers will suddenly bolt. Again, TWLO has continued to invest in R&D and to provide strong service.Yet there are still risks. Let's face it, large companies can certainly leverage their power to exact better terms, especially when there are alternatives available.Valuation: Even with the plunge in Twilio stock, the multiple is still at hefty levels. Note that the price-to-sales ratio is roughly 10X. Even for a fast-growing cloud company, this is steep.Take a look at some of the valuations in the industry:CompanyPrice-to-Sales MultipleNew Relic Inc(NYSE:NEWR) 8XBox Inc(NYSE:BOX) 5.3XApptio Inc(NASDAQ:APTI) 3XBottom Line on TWLO stockTwilio definitely has a strong platform and it has continued to innovate it. Going forward, the company should benefit from the megatrends of cloud computing and mobile.But for now, it's probably best not to take a position in TWLO stock as the valuation remains fairly high. Let's face it, there are cheaper alternatives available when it comes to fast-growing enterprise plays, such as NEWR, BOX or APTI.Tom Taulli runs the InvestorPlace blogIPO Playbookand is the author of various books, includingTaxes 2017: Saving A Bundle.Follow him on Twitter at@ttaulli.

PayPal's Stock Dips After Google Announces Money Transfer Feature;3/14/2017;"PayPal'sPYPLstock closed the day down 1.5% on Tuesday to $42.10 after Googleannounced in a blog postthat users would now be able to send and receive money in their Gmail app.Alphabet'sGOOGLGoogle said that users would be able to receive and request money as an email attachment through their Gmail App on Android. This service will have no fees, and will work with other email services as well. Recipients can also arrange the money to go straight to their bank account. To use the new feature, users will have to set up a Google Wallet account if they don't have one.Google's move to mobile could be a direct challenge to PayPal's Venmo, the dominant person-to-person mobile payment app and social network.Will It Work?As personal finances become digitalized, users not only want payments to be faster and safer, but millennial users also look to share them. While the Gmail App allows users to send and receive money, users won't be able to brag about their transactions like on Venmo.Venmo users can send money to a friend and write a memo. After the transaction is completed, all of the user's friends on Venmo will be able to see the amount of money sent and the memo. And it turns out that people are interested in knowing whom their friends eat with and where they eat.""A lot of what we're seeing there is that people don't just come to transact. They 're coming there to see what their friends were doing,"" PayPal's chief operating officer Bill Ready said at a Morgan Stanley technology conference in late February.One of the main reasons that PayPal is the top person-to-person vendor in the U.S. is that Venmo processed $5.6 billion in payment volume in the fourth quarter of 2016, an increase of 126%, the company said in its earnings report.Bottom LineIt is hard to say whether or not Google's new feature will disrupt PayPal's dominance in person-to-person transactions. With the introduction of One Touch, a faster check out option online, and Venmo expanding with their ""Pay with Venmo,"" PayPal is certainly fortifying its power in the online transaction service.Zacks' 2017 IPO Watch ListBefore looking into the stocks mentioned above, you may want to get a head start on potential tech IPOs that are popping up on Zacks' radar.

Apple Found Guilty of Price Fixing iPhones in Russia;3/14/2017;"AppleAAPLhas beenfound guilty for price fixingiPhones in Russia by Russian anti-trust regulator FAS (the Federal Antimonopoly Service). Apple has been price fixing in Russia since the release of the iPhone 5 and through the iPhone 6s; allegations against the iPhone 7 have not been proven.The FAS's investigation shows that when retailers in Russia attempted to sell Apple's iPhones at a lower price than what Apple wished, a local subsidiary of Apple would email the retailers demanding them to hike their discounts. If the retailers failed to comply then Apple threatened to terminate their contracts to sell iPhones.No comments have been made from Apple yet; however, FAS head Andrey Tsarikovsky stated Apple has ""actively cooperated"" to resolve the issue. Penalties have yet to be announced; in the meantime, Apple has three months to challenge the ruling if they choose to do so.In translation from a statement by the FAS, their public announcement wrote, ""At the same time, Apple Rus monitored retail prices for Apple iPhone smartphones installed by resellers in online stores and retail outlets, and, in case of setting ""unsuitable"" prices, the Russian subsidiary Apple sent emails to resellers with a request to change them. Also, compliance with recommended retail prices by resellers could be due to the provisions of contracts between Apple Rus and resellers.""Reporters say that the worst case scenario for Apple will be a fine calculated by 15% of Russian sales; however, an official penalty will take several months to figure out.Apple is not the only leading smartphone producer to be found guilty of fraudulent activity in Russia. GoogleGOOGLwas fined $6.75 million by the FAS just last year for preinstalling their apps on Android smartphones and tablets.Zacks' 2017 IPO Watch ListBefore looking into the stocks mentioned above, you may want to get a head start on potential tech IPOs that are popping up on Zacks' radar.

Twitter Is Selling Ads Like It's Television;3/14/2017;"One of the strongest trends in advertising is the shift of   budgets from television to digital as people spend less time   watching conventional TV. Consumers are spending much more time   on social media sites likeFacebook(NASDAQ: FB) ,Twitter(NYSE:TWTR) ,Snap's(NYSE: SNAP) Snapchat, and YouTube -- the subsidiary of Google,   anAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) company.But if advertisers are going to replace television ads with   digital ads, they'd prefer to buy them the same way they buy   those old TV commercials. Twitter is happy to oblige. The company   started offering guaranteed views for pre-roll video ads, and   it's also letting marketers decide what content its ads run   against, according to a report fromAdAge.Back in July, former COO Adam Bain described Twitter's ability   to attract television ad spend as a huge opportunity for the   company. With Twitter's revenue expected to fall this year,   Twitter needs to do everything it can to attract those   budgets.makeArticleAd();""The Starters"" is Twitter's first live show created as part     of its deal with the NBA. Image source: Twitter.A bigger focus on video adsLast month,Twitter decided to reassessits direct response, promoted tweets, and TellApart products, and   focus more intently on video ads. That's where Twitter sees the   potential for its highest return on investment after slashing its   marketing and sales personnel by 9% last fall.The company has been growing the amount of video on its   platform by integrating Periscope, partnering with major media   companies, and shifting to an algorithmic-based timeline so it   can push more videos into users' feeds. In the fourth quarter,   Twitter streamed more than 600 hours of live premium video from   content partners, attracting 31 million unique viewers. Deals   with the NFL, NBA, Bloomberg, and others has opened up a lot of   high-quality video ad inventory similar to television.By offering guarantees on marketers hitting their target   audiences, Twitter should be able to attract more TV ad budgets.   Television networks also offer guarantees, and use extremely   popular events to make good on them if they fail to hit the mark   with the original ad run. Twitter has the advantage of more   advanced targeting capabilities than television, which should   enable it to dynamically insert ads based on users' profiles, and   more easily make good on those guarantees.But Twitter has a lot of competitionTwitter isn't the only company competing for television ad   budgets. Snap explicitly talks about the decline in television   viewership among millennials, its primary demographic, as a   massive opportunity for it to capitalize upon. Snapchat has   several ad formats, and it's currently focusing on increasing the   number of video ads it can show in users' stories, publisher's   stories, and live stories.Meanwhile, Facebook is going after the television ad market by   developing more video features on both its flagship app and   Instagram. Facebook now has a dedicated video section within the   app, and the company is seeding it with high-quality content.   It's been testing mid-roll ads to grab more ad revenue as it   faces saturation of its regular newsfeed ads.YouTube has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of shifting   ad budgets, and now it's looking to prove its worth with literal   TV ads. The impending launch of YouTube TV will provide a few ad   slots per hour for YouTube to fill in its over-the-top streaming   TV service. If YouTube can prove results better than regular   television commercials, it may attract more ad spend to its main   platform, as well.Can Twitter take the pressure?With a growing number of options for marketers to buy   high-quality digital video ads, Twitter has to do what it can to   stand out from the crowd. It's notably outsized by both Facebook   and YouTube, and Snapchat boasts much better engagement and the   demographics marketers look for.Offering guarantees, and more say on what kind of content ads   are paired with, is a good start, but those offers are easily   replicated. YouTube, for example, already offers the option to   buy into Google Preferred, which lets advertisers select specific   packages of the most popular YouTube channels. If the guarantees   make a big difference in buying trends, don't expect Twitter's   victory to last long, as Google and Facebook quickly jump on   board with their own guarantees.10 stocks we like better than TwitterWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Web Browsers Are Making A Comeback, Just Not In The U.S.;3/14/2017;"In the U.S. where the monthly data plan and Wi-Fi are abundant, the market for single-purpose apps like FacebookFBand SnapchatSNAPhas flourished. However, across the world, it is not apps that are racking up users but mobile web browsers.Browsers are popular again, especially in developing countries, where data plans are not accessible for everyone and prepaid data plans can't support data heavy single-purpose apps. Users are finding themselves turning to web browsers to stay connected.It is not a second choice either. While it may feel like apps are faster and easier to use, browser developers have been working hard to compensate users. Not only have browser companies like UC Browser from AlibabaBABA, Google Chrome from Alphabet Inc.GOOGLand Opera Mini by Opera Software, have made their browsers data-efficient, but these companies have also beenadding new featureslike voice recognition, file sharing and integration with social media.In countries where it is easy to buy used or refurbished smartphones for as little as $25, it is easy to see why users lean towards web browsers instead of single-purpose apps. You spend less and achieve more.The number of Internet users globally has reached around 3.5 billion and many of the people that became Internet users in the past few years are all part of the rise of the global middle class in emerging markets. And they provided the biggest user growth for browser makers. These companies also know how to keep their users occupied and monetizing them through mobile advertising.Internet giants like Google and Facebook are noticing these trends. Two thirds of Facebook's users are in emerging markets and Google's Chrome remains the dominant browser in many emerging markets. Facebook has Facebook Lite, an app designed for low-bandwidth users and Google pays other search engines to direct search traffic to ad-supported Google services.It is logical that these new users in the emerging markets will likely follow in the footsteps of their richer peers and make the shift from web browsers to apps as they get wealthier and data becomes cheaper, though this doesn't worry the browser developers. There will always be a new group of users joining emerging market.India is projected to increase its per-capita income by 125% by 2025 with its population of 1.3 billion people, according to Morgan StanleyMS. Opera Software said Africa is growing the fastest in terms of new downloads and there are 600 million potential users in Southeast Asia, which is a huge market for these browsers.Until cellular connection become more accessible and affordable, web browsers will maintain its popularity.Zacks' 2017 IPO Watch ListBefore looking into the stocks mentioned above, you may want to get a head start on potential tech IPOs that are popping up on Zacks' radar.

Can Intel Catch Tesla, Google, Apple In Autonomous Car Race?;3/14/2017;"Thanks to its$15.3 billion acquisitionof Israeli self-driving technology company Mobileye (MBLY), Intel (INTC) is no longer on the outside looking in when it comes to the autonomous car market, which has become the new battleground for high-tech companies looking new revenue streams.While Intel’s semiconductor prowess and breadth in R&D should accelerate the pace of Mobileye’s technology innovation, will the combined company have enough tread to catch the likes of Tesla (TSLA) and Google (GOOGL)?Intel seems to think so. The deal, which sent MBLY stock soaring 28% in active trade Monday, ""merges the intelligent eyes of the autonomous car with the intelligent brain that actually drives the car,” said Intel CEO Brian Krzanich in a statement. “The saying 'what's under the hood' will increasingly refer to computing, not horsepower.”makeArticleAd();Investors weren’t immediately impressed, sending Intel shares down 2.1% to close at a three-month low of $35.16. This isn’t Intel’s first run at self-driving cars, however. The Santa Clara, Calif.-based chip giant, through its financing arm Intel Capital, hasspent $250 millionin R&D looking for an edge. The Mobileye deal, meanwhile, has now made it known that autonomous driving capabilities was never a hobby for Intel. It’s become a critical market for the company.Still, Tesla and Google won’t be run off the road. In December, GooglelaunchedWaymo, which stands for “a new way forward in mobility.” Waymo’s website features a two-seater prototype fitted with Google’s hardware and software that is built to move with the touch of a button, with neither a steering wheel nor a brake pedal. Meanwhile, in Tesla’s most popular sedan, the Model S, the company has already rolled out self-driving capabilities that receive incremental updates on autopilot features.These updates, which include “exit ramp autonomy” on highways, automatic lane-changing, and auto-steering, are also available to Model X, its SUV family. And to say nothing about Apple’s (AAPL) own autonomous car ambitions, which theWall Street Journalrecently confirmed. With more money stashed than the U.S. Treasury, Apple’s autonomous car position depends only on how hard it wants to mash the accelerator.But here’s the thing: Mobileye was once a prominent partner to Tesla, meaning it could have had first-hand knowledge of what Tesla has under its hood. And to the extent Intel can utilize that knowledge to accelerate its own technology, Intel will narrow that gap relatively quickly.At the same time, the fact that Intel wants to emerge as the go-to chip name when it comes to autonomous car processors, powering functions such as displays and communication between two self-driving vehicles, Intel doesn’t necessarily have to be the car, it can just be the brainsinsidethe car — something it thrived on during the height of the PC era."

Don’t Follow Warren Buffett Into Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock … Yet;3/14/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhen it comes to investing, Warren Buffett says investors should go with index funds. But Buffett himself takes a different approach by buying individual stocks, such asApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL). The question is: Should you do as Buffett says and index, or do as Buffettdoes, and buy AAPL stock?makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockBuffett's lack of technology exposure is well-known among Wall Street veterans. In fact, many even ridiculed the Oracle of Omaha for missing out names like Apple,Alphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL) andAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN).Until Apple came along,International Business Machines Corp.(NYSE:IBM) was Buffett's largest tech play. He used to say he skipped over tech stocks because he didn't understand them well enough.But it appears that Buffett's understanding of technology is growing.I n 2016,Berkshire Hathaway Inc.(NYSE:BRK.B) reported a 9.8 million-share position in AAPL stock as of March 31. That position almost doubled to 15.2 million shares as of Sept. 30, then almost quadrupled to a whopping 57.3 million shares by year's end.So what has Buffett done with AAPL stock in 2017?7 Blue-Chip Stocks Holding You BackThe Oracle of Omahahas more than doubled his position. The stake now stands at some 133 million shares worth about $18.1 billion. Buffett buying some 75 million shares of AAPL stock in such a short span shows confidence in Apple.While Buffett is not known for his short-term predictions, he is heralded for his long-term investments. So, what does he like so much about Apple stock anyway? ""Apple strikes me as having quite a sticky product, and an enormously useful product to people that use it,"" Buffett told CNBC in late-February.Perhaps the most ironic part of Buffett's discussion on Apple centered on his own device - the famed investor doesn't even own an iPhone.Positives for AAPL StockApple stock has a lot of positives. For starters, the company is flush with cash. With more than $40 per share of cash, Apple could go on a transformative M&A spree - even with the repatriation tax that, right now, it would have to pay. Add in the potential for a tax repatriation holiday from the Trump administration, and Apple's in even better shape.Additionally, Apple is a cash cow that continues to bring in billions of dollars each quarter, which should help continue to fund dividends and stock buybacks. Plus, its cash hoard should continue to grow over time.Despite rallying more than 40% over the past eight months, AAPL stock still trades with a below-market valuation. Sporting a price-to-earnings ratio of around 16, it's hard to consider Apple overvalued.And the valuation argument is important. Too many investors try to justify a higher Apple stock price by applying a market-average multiple. That's an inaccurate measurement, as Apple tends to trade between a P/E range of 10 to 17 (more on that in a moment). So rarely will it trade in-line with the averageS&P 500stock.With that said, having a low valuation is part of what makes Apple stock attractive. Shares go through pretty extreme ups and downs. But long-term investors can feel confident in buying a stock that's not egregiously priced.Finally, investors can look forward to Apple releasing themuch-anticipated iPhone 8later this fall. With a higher potential selling price and plenty of fancy features, the new device is likely to drive record results.Add on its quickly growing, high-margin Services business, and AAPL stock becomes even more attractive for long-term investors.Should You Follow Buffett Into AAPL Stock?With all these positives, Apple stock may seem like a slam-dunk.However, I think investors would be best off waiting for a pullback. While we just highlighted its P/E ratio as a positive, itisclose to the top of its five-year range. AAPL stock is cheap compared to the average stock, but getting expensive compared to its historical average.Additionally, Apple stock has gone on a massive rally. While it's admittedly consolidating nicely just under $140, I find it hard to be a buyer at these levels.Why General Electric Company (GE) Stock Is Way Too DangerousWith the overall market still up big, I can sleep more comfortably at night waiting for a pullback to buy Apple stock. If it doesn't materialize, that is something waiting investors will have to live with. I would rather miss a few points of upside in order to avoid significant points on the downside.Historically, Apple's stock is volatile, whichmakes a pullback likelyat some point in the next few months.A 7% to 10% correction would be needed for me to get interested.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author ofFuture Blue Chips.

How a Major Drugmaker Plans to Cure Disease... Without Drugs;3/14/2017;"Pharmaceutical giantGlaxoSmithKline plc(NYSE: GSK) has the resources to pursue long-term bets in   medicine that could eventually change the course of disease   treatment and yield large payoffs. Three and half years ago the   company announced its plans for an audacious goal: to literally   eavesdrop on the body's electrical system and enter into the   body's own internal conversations in order to heal disease.Not as crazy as it soundsMedicine has long focused on chemical processes to alter   biological function, but every organ has a nerve connection that   regulates its function. Organs are controlled by patterns of   electrical impulses transmitted through nerve fibers, but when   organs dysfunction in chronic disease, the electrical patterns   are different. That fact opens up the possibility that inserting   patterns in nerves to certain organs can correct conditions that   lead to disease. Using electrical impulses to influence organ   function is nothing new -- cardiac pacemakers have been in use   for decades -- but scientists are just beginning to realize the   possibilities of using nerve signals to restore organs to normal   function and actually treat disease.Image source: GlaxoSmithKline plc.makeArticleAd();A seminal paper was published in the scientific journal Nature   in 2000 which presented evidence that stimulation of the vagus   nerve could actually trigger an anti-inflammatory response in   rats. Electrical stimulation of the nerve inhibited the   production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), which is also the   mechanism used by some blockbuster anti-inflammatory drugs such   asAbbVie's Humira. Since then, researchers have come to believe that   influencing the the body's electrical system could lead to   treatments for conditions as diverse as asthma, arthritis,   inflammatory bowel disease, hypertension, diabetes, infertility,   and even cancer. A drug gets dispersed throughout the body,   affecting multiple pathways and organs in the process and   potentially causing undesired side effects, but targeting the   signals of a specific nerve bundle with an implanted device has   the potential for producing highly localized and specific   effects.GlaxoSmithKline announced in 2013 an effort to pour resources   into the field of bioelectronics, taking a leadership role in the   industry. The company announced a $1 million innovation prize,   the creation and funding of a network of researchers, and the   launch of a $50 million venture capital fund, Action Potential   Venture Capital, to invest in pioneering bioelectronic   technologies.The investment is already producing visible progress. The   first investment by the venture capital fund was in SetPoint   Medical, a privately held California company that is developing a   platform to treat inflammatory diseases by modulating nerve   signals with implanted devices and was co-founded by one of the   authors of the original 2000 paper in Nature. In July 2016 the   company reported the results of a first-in-human study of vagal   nerve stimulation by an implanted device for treatment of   arthritis. The study showed that the approach inhibited TNF   production and improved symptoms, including in some patients who   had not responded to conventional drug treatments. In January   2017, SetPoint reported positive results of another human study   using its device to treat Crohn's disease.Googling the body's internal networkImage source: GlaxoSmithKline plc.As encouraging as the results from SetPoint are, that approach   is primitive compared with the ambitions of a $715 million joint   venture that Glaxo andAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) birthed last August called Galvani   Bioelectronics. The collaboration with Verily Life Sciences,   formerly known as Google Life Sciences, aims to do no less than   to map the human nervous system, crack the electrical codes   flowing through nerves controlling the body's organs, and be able   to modify the signals to restore health using implantable   devices the size of a grain of rice.The effort has enormous potential... and enormous challenges.   Verily will contribute expertise in device miniaturization and   software. The tiny devices will need a read/write interface to   nerve fibers and a way to be powered without heating the body --   both significant technical problems yet to be solved. The   approach will also require the analysis and interpretation of   massive amounts of data taken from the signals sensed on   individual bundles of nerves controlling the targeted organs,   something that's right up Google's alley. Glaxo, for its part,   has been working for several years on a ""nerve atlas"" with the   goal of identifying the specific nerve fibers whose signals will   need to be decoded and modulated.A long shot, but we could get news by 2019Executives from GlaxoSmithKline and Verily are optimistic,   though. At the time of the announcement last August, Glaxo   executive Moncef Slaoui expressed the belief that Galvani could   begin human trials within 18 months, achieve proof of concept in   three years, and begin commercialization in seven years. This   timeline puts the effort on the radar of long-term investors, who   could be seeing news on developments in the next few years.The challenge is huge, but then so is the potential   payoff. ""Bioelectronic medicines have the potential of doing   to the pharmaceutical industry what biopharmaceuticals did to   small molecules back in the 1980s,"" says Imran Eba,   partner in Action Potential Venture Capital. If that happens,   GlaxoSmithKline could be in ideal position to benefit from the   next big disruption in medical technology.10 stocks we like better than GlaxoSmithKlineWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Carries Some Risks;3/14/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsI recently wrote anarticlesuggesting thatAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) was the perfect value play, as it was a growth stock that was not unreasonably valued based on various criteria. Now I'll dive into what I think the risks of GOOGL stock are, and how they may manifest.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockMy biggest concern with GOOGL stock has always been that it is effectively a one-trick pony. Alphabet is the largest digital advertising billboard in the world, with about 88% of its revenues coming from advertising. Moreover, GOOGL stock's growth has been driven by this spectacular seizure of internet territory from competitors.In fact, during the financial crisis, ad revenues still grew about 8% year-over-year in 2009 despite a worldwide ad revenuedeclineof 11% that year.GOOGL Stock and Digital AdvertisingNow, digital advertising was still in its hyper-growth phase back then. Should another major crisis hit, I'm not so sure that Alphabet won't see a decline. Yet what's so astonishing about GOOGL stock is just how much money it makes from advertising. It could get hit with a 20% decline in total revenues, which would bring it roughly in line with fiscal year 2015 results, and still generate net income of $15 billion or so, and operating cash flow of $26 billion or so.This is hardly a catastrophe, which shows that for now at least, GOOGL has a lock on substantial growth in ad revenue. However, that advertising is the result of people using Google's search engine. What if that changes? Right now, Google has more than 80% search engine marketshare. It's so popular that we now use the product's name as a verb.7 Blue-Chip Stocks Holding You BackI think it will be very difficult to supplant Google as far as search engine usage goes. However, there is other behavior which may result in less reliance on the search engine and, therefore, fewer eyeballs for ads. Mobile apps have obviously exploded in number and usage. The more adept and fully functional that apps become, the less Google may be used.Social media is only going to grow, and the more that these products offer in terms of either their own search engines, or places for advertisers to divide their ad spend, the worse it is for GOOGL.There's also some interesting competition in the form of product searches, and of course, that competition comes fromAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN). According to a 2016 PowerReviewssurvey, 38% of users use Amazon as a place to search for products, and Google comes in second at 35%. I think about my own usage when it comes to product searched, and yes, I always start with Amazon. Inventory, price and reviews are the reasons why people start there. The larger that Amazon grows, the stickier it will become as far as product searches, and that could mean fewer eyeballs for GOOGL.Obviously, Alphabet Inc. has plenty of money and can ramp up competition in mobile access, butApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) andFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) obviously have a corner on that market so far.What Nvidia Needs to Avoid a Breakdown (NVDA)There is some regulatory risk, as well. The EU slammed Alphabet Inc. for tweaking search results to direct people to its own shopping sites. The FCC is an unknown beast - it could end up regulating the internet in ways harmful to GOOGL stock.However, when it comes to buying the stock, I don't see immediate dangers to GOOGL that makes its valuation less attractive. At 18x next year's earnings, and five-year annualized analyst projections of 19.3% growth, it's already undervalued. When I give it a 10% premium for global brand name, cash flow and cash on hand, it becomes a true growth and value play.

(NASDAQ:INTC-Free Report), Mobileye NV (NYSE:MBLY-Free Report),Tesla(NASDAQ:TSLA-Free Report),General Motors(NYSE:GM-Free Report) andAlphabet(NASDAQ:GOOGL-Free Report).Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations.Get #1Stock of the Day pick for free.Here are highlights from Monday's Analyst Blog:Are More Driverless Car Deals in the Future?On Monday, semiconductor chip makerIntel Corp. (NASDAQ:INTC-Free Report)announceda huge move in the self-driving car race, buying Israeli firmMobileye NV (NYSE:MBLY-Free Report)for a reported $15.3 billion. The deal values Mobileye at about $63.54 per share, which is a 34% premium to its closing price last Friday. MBLY stock skyrocketed around 30% to $61.35 per share in morning trading on Monday, while shares of INTC were down about 2% to $35.22 per share.Intel plans on integrating its own automated driving group with Mobileye's renowned operations, and the combined entity will be run by Mobileye Chairman Amnon Shashua. The deal will combine Intel's processors with Mobileye's renowned computer vision, making it the biggest purchase of a company that's solely focused on the self-driving market.Not only is this acquisition a huge deal for Intel, but it's also an endorsement of both the Israeli tech scene as well as the entire self-driving vehicle industry as a whole. Big-name automakers like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA-Free Report), General Motors (NYSE:GM-Free Report), among many others, are racing to get a self-driving car model on the road, while tech giants like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL-Free Report) and Uber sprinting just as fast to perfect the technology behind the cars.Last year, GM spent $1 billion to speed up its self-driving program with the acquisition of Cruise Automation, while Uber recently bought self-driving truck maker Otto for $680 million last August. These two transactions are just the tip of the iceberg, and with 2020 fast approaching, we should expect even more deals from the biggest players in the driverless car marketIf the necessary regulations are in place, 2020 is the year every company, tech and automaker, in the race plans to have a working self-driving car-or fleet-on the road.Intel and Mobileye already have previous ties, having partnered with German automaker BMW AG to test about 40 self-driving cars on the road. It will be interesting to see which automaker will be lucky enough to be able to utilize the new entity's technology.The deal will add to Intel's adjusted per share earnings, and is expected to close in the next nine months.5 Trades Could Profit ""Big-League"" from Trump   PoliciesIf the stocks above spark your interest, wait until you look into companies primed to make substantial gains from Washington's changing course.Today Zacks reveals 5 tickers that could benefit from new trends like streamlined drug approvals, tariffs, lower taxes, higher interest rates, and spending surges in defense and infrastructure.See these buy recommendations now >>About Zacks Equity ResearchZacks Equity Research provides the best of quantitative and qualitative analysis to help investors know what stocks to buy and which to sell for the long-term.Continuous coverage is provided for a universe of 1,150 publicly traded stocks.

3 Reasons Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Is Becoming Tougher to Own;3/14/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBy most accounts, the future looks bright forApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL). Citi recently upped its price target on Apple stock in anticipation of a massive wave of upgrades from iPhone owners who have aging models, and the company's plans to double its high-margin service revenue over the course of the coming four years doesn't seem un-doable.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockAfter all, AAPL has been beefing up its app and digital content business at a rather brisk pace for some time now.And yet, to observers not looking at the company through rose-colored glasses, there's potential trouble ahead. Here's a closer look at three headwinds that could slow AAPL shares down more than most traders might expect.Three Troubling Realities for Apple StockLast week, analysts with Citi raised their price target on Apple stock from $140 to $160 per share (maintaining the research outfit's ""Buy"" rating), thinking a wide swath of the 715 million iPhone owners out there right now are on the verge of finally upgrading their device, as31% of those owners haven't upgraded in a couple of years.It's not bad logic; we know the company's best new customers are its old ones.10 Dangerous Dividend Stocks to Dump NowMeanwhile, though it was little more than an afterthought just a year ago, CEO Tim Cook has put plenty of emphasis on sales of services and digital content. He's only scratched the surface, however. After generating roughly $25 billion in revenue in 2016, Apple is aiming for $50 billion in services revenue by $50 billion. That's still only a fraction of the $215 billion worth of revenue Apple mustered in 2016, but digital sales now make up the company's second-biggest segment; the iPhone is still the biggest.Before we pop the corks on the champagne bottles though, there are three red flags everyone would be wise to process.1. The iPhone 8 (probably) costs too muchWhile the launch of the iPhone 7 in the fall of last year could be considered a success in that the company sold arecord-breaking 78.2 million units in the previous quarter, given thehype surrounding the device, the company should have blown away sales figures for its iPhone 6.Some (many) suspect the demand that should have materialized for the 7 was ultimately displaced to the iPhone 8, which is supposed to be unveiled in September of this year. The word is that the admittedly impressive device is going togo for a cool $1000 each. At that price, even the most loyal of Apple fans could balk.2. The popular smartphone is preemptively cannibalizing itselfAside from sticker shock, would-be owners of the upcoming iPhone 8 may keep their wallet closed for the same reason many potential buyers of the iPhone 7 didn't pull the trigger - they're waiting for the phone after the next phone, which is sure to be even more amazing.To that end, what's currently being referred to as the iPhone 9 already promises (in rumors) to be an amazing piece of hardware,complete with a folding screen. That may postpone purchases of the iPhone 8 later this year, though 2018's iPhone 9 could see softer demand because whispers of the iPhone 10 rumors will be circulating by then.It's a vicious cycle, with Apple arguably unable to ever really log a blowout iPhone launch.Fitbit Has BlackBerry Syndrome (FIT)3. The Google Pixel is really, really impressiveFinally, as solid as the recent Pixel phone fromAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) subsidiary Google was, it wasn't a game-changer. Analysts estimate the companyonly sold about 2.5 million of the device.Bear in mind, however, this is Google's first direct foray into the smartphone world, and could be considered little more than a dry run.The Pixel 2 is slated to debut sometime this year, and it's a good bet the company has made a point of learning a lot with its first outing.Bottom Line for AAPL StockInvariably, some (or several) owners of Apple stock interpret these concerns as a call that the company is doomed, and then proceed to ""colorfully disagree."" So, let me clarify something that shouldn't need saying. That is, even on AAPL stock's worst day it's still essentially unstoppable to other smartphone players. Don't read too much into the worries.On the flipside, in that Apple stock is all too often found on investors' pedestals - lifted there by assumptions that the company is infallible - it's never a bad idea to recognize all plausible risks. These three risks could each end up stirring up surprising headwinds, and nothing takes a toll on a stock like an unexpected disappointment.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace7 Blue-Chip Stocks Holding You Back7 Future Blue-Chip Stocks You Need to BuyThe post3 Reasons Apple Inc.

About to Buy Driverless Car Stocks? Read This First;3/13/2017;"There's no shortage of technology companies and automotive   makers that are are betting that autonomous vehicles will   transform both of their industries. But how do you figure   out which companies are poised to benefit the most?To answer that, investors first need to know what the market   potential is for driverless cars, what might slow it down, and   how long it will take for the segment to mature, and then   determine which driverless car investment angle they want to   take. Here are a few steps to help you get started:Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();How much the driverless car market will be     worthBy 2025, the driverless car market is expected to be worth $42   billion, according to Boston Consulting Group. The market size   jumps up to $77 billion by 2035, which is the same year thatIHSestimates that there will be 76 million autonomous vehicles   already on the road.And it doesn't end there. Driverless cars are expected to   transform ride sharing services, allow car owners to rent out   their own vehicles -- asTesla's(NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO Elon Musk has suggested -- and even help   traditional carmakers create their own ride hailing services,   likeFord(NYSE: F) has proposed.This might slow driverless car stocks downIt's not going to be all sunshine and lollipops for driverless   car stocks though. There are still many hurdles facing these   companies, including federal regulations, safety concerns, and   consumer adoption issues.The two biggest automotive markets, however -- the U.S. and   China -- have thus far been very open to driverless cars. Back in   September, the federal government released guidelines for states   to help ensure that companies are able to innovate and not be   hampered by differing rules across state lines. But the problem   is that we're still in the very early stages of driverless   car technology (i.e. neither you nor I can buy fully autonomous   vehicles), so while the government is open to it now, that could   change when more tech starts being used by the general   population.And even if the government doesn't end up stifling autonomous   vehicles, there's currently a growing movement toban driverless cars in New Yorkbecause people are afraid they'll eliminate jobs for taxi   drivers, bus drivers and others in the transportation sector. Add   to that the fact that there are parts of the population thatfeel very uneasyabout driverless cars and it's clear that the autonomous vehicle   market still has a long way to go.There are plenty of ways to investCompanies like Tesla are among the obvious choices for betting   on driverless cars. CEO Elon Musk has said he wants to have a   fully autonomous car capable of driving itself across the country   by 2018, and every new Tesla built right now already has the   hardware capabilities for full autonomy (though not all of the   software is activated).Tech behemothAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) is another clear choice. Google's   parent company recently spun out its driverless car segment into   its own company,called Waymo, and is working to bring fully autonomous minivans to the roads   this year for public testing, along with a ride-sharing   service.And then there are chipmakers likeNVIDIA(NASDAQ: NVDA) , which is investing heavily in artificial   intelligence and its own supercomputers to power driverless cars.   The company'sDrive PX 2 supercomputeris already used by 80 automakers and automotive suppliers   (including Tesla) and is likely to expand its automotive revenues   substantially in the coming years.Of course, you could go the traditional route too and bet on   automakers like Ford, which is also focusing its attention on   self-driving technologies. The company recently invested $1   billion in a self-driving car start-up, called Argo AI, and says   that it will release its own fully autonomous vehicle (with no   steering wheel!) by 2021.Ford may be taking a slower approach than some other   self-driving tech makers, but it has plans to have 90   self-driving test vehicles on the road this year and is working   with more than 40 start-ups on driverless car technology.And if you're looking for a driverless car stock outside of   the U.S., thenBaidu(NASDAQ: BIDU)  isprobably your best bet. The company has been developing self-driving technology for   years and just launched a test program in some Chinese cities to   implement its tech. The company wants to release a fully   self-driving car by next year with the hopes of having a   ride-hailing service in the coming years. Aside from its   aggressive driverless car approach, Baidu benefits from China's   openness to self-driving technologies and fewer regulations for   road tests than the U.S.Here's how long you might need to wait for this to play     outAlright, so now we know how big this market will be, some of   the potential hurdles, and who the key players are. So how long   will investors have to wait for this opportunity to pan out? IHS   estimates that we'll reach worldwide driverless car ubiquity by   about 2050.That doesn't mean it'll take that long for driverless car   stocks to benefit of course, but it does mean that we still have   a long way to go before the market will mature -- which makes now   the perfect time for investors to start considering driverless   car stocks.10 stocks we like better than NvidiaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Does DISH, Sony, or AT&T Have the Best Live-Streaming Cable Deal?;3/13/2017;"Cable without an actual cable may be the next big thing not   just for cord-cutters looking to save a buck, but also for   consumers looking to leave their current providers without making   a major sacrifice.DISH Network(NASDAQ: DISH) was the first player in the space with the launch   of its live-streaming cable alternative a little over two years   ago.Sony(NYSE: SNE) began testing its own PlayStation Vue in select   markets not long after that and has since taken its cable-like   streaming product national. Most recently,AT&T(NYSE: T) launched DirecTV Now, giving consumers three distinct   choices (not counting the not-yet-launched options from YouTube   and Hulu which are still developing).For consumers it's a lot of choices, but unlike traditional   cable where every company offers roughly the same package, these   three players are somewhat different. That makes determining the   best one a bit of a moving target, but with three players in the   space (and two more coming) it's clearly a buyer's market.makeArticleAd();DISH Sling has the cheapest offer. Image source: DISH.DISH has the lowest base priceFor consumers looking to cut the cord in order to save money   (or those who never had a cord, but are looking for the cheapest   way to have some live-streaming channels) DISH'sSling   TVmay be the answer. The service offers 30 channels including ESPN,   CNN, TNT, and a number of other cable favorites for $20 a month   as part of its ""Orange"" package. For $25 a month consumers could   opt for ""Blue"" which drops ESPN but adds the FOX family of   channels including the broadcast network while offering 44 total   choices.On top of the base packages Sling Subscribers can choose from   a number of extra add-ons in areas like news, sports, and kids   programming which cost $5 or $10 each. Sling members can also add   HBO, Cinemax, Starz, or one of a variety of global programming   options which conveniently all work within the same player making   for a very television-like experience.PlayStation Vue is cord-free cableSony's PlayStation Vue has four packages starting at $29.99 a   month. The entry-level offer, ""Access Slim"" comes with 45   channels, including in very-limited markets some broadcast   networks. Most of the stations offered are the same ones Sling TV   has, with consumers paying slightly more money for them. The   ""Core Slim"" package offers 60 channels for $34.99 (perhaps the   best deal) while ""Elite Slim"" comes with 90 channels for $44.99,   and Ultra Slim at $64.99 which has the same 90 channels plus HBO   and Showtime.Like Sling, PlayStation Vue also offers add-on packages of   Spanish-language and news programs. In addition users can buy a   number of premium channels on a stand-alone basis along with HBO   and Showtime. The bottom tiers for PS Vue are very similar to   DISH, albeit pricier, while the higher-end tiers are essentially   full-on cable packages (minus the broadcast networks in most   cases) at better-than-cable pricing.Here's what DirecTV is doingAT&T's entree into the space looks a lot like Sony's.   DirecTV Now offers very similar pricing with 60 channels costing   $35, including ABC and FOX, along with some top-tier cable   favorites. $50 a month gets users 80-plus channels, while $60 a   month comes with over 100, and $70 takes the package to over 120   stations including Starz.Subscribers can also add Starz separately to lower-tier deals,   or add HBO or Cinemax. AT&T does not offer add-on channel   packages covering specialty stations the way its rivals do. In   addition DirecTV Now launches with better pricing (the $35 price   for the $50 package) and it seems likely that AT&T will offer   future specials likely tied to bundling other services from the   company.Which one is the best?For consumers it's easy to test each service because all offer   free trials, while also letting users come and go as they please   without contracts or penalties. Sling has the best service for   people looking to cut expenses while Sony and AT&T offer good   deals on services that come close to mirroring actual cable. Of   those two, DirecTV Now gets a slight edge because it offers ABC   and FOX nationally while PlayStation Vue only offers access to   broadcast networks selectively.In addition to varying channel selections, all three services   have different rules when it comes to multiple streams. Sling   Orange, the cheapest service, only offers a single stream, while   the $25 Blue packages allows three. DirectTV Now offers two   streams to all subscribers while Sony's service allows customers   to stream on five registered devices at a time giving PS Vue the   advantage in this area, but it's a minor edge over Blue.When it comes to interface all three leave something to be   desired. Sony's service has a DVR (with a lot of limitations)   while Sling has some on-demand programming, as does DirecTV. The   biggest drawback of the streaming services is that none of them   offer an experience that feels like flipping around with   traditional cable. Still, once you have selected a show, the   viewing experience works and feels familiar.Sony and AT&T have decent products that save consumers   some money over the average comparable cable package. But for a   traditional family watching on multiple televisions, the savings   may not be worth the holes in what's offered along with a viewing   experience that still lags traditional cable. Sling has those   same limitations, but the three streams for $25 Blue package   represents the best combo of content and value, giving it a small   victory in an emerging space.10 stocks we like better than DISH NetworkWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Should Apple Inc. Cut Its Dividend? (AAPL);3/13/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) is the world's largest technology company, and it once was one of the best growth stocks on the market. It has shifted gears, though, and now Apple stock is one of the more promising dividend growth plays on the market.makeArticleAd();Source:FlickrAAPL paid its first dividend - at least since 1995 - on Aug. 16, 2012. It paid investors 38.9 cents per share on a split-adjusted basis.The payout has been hiked four times since, and currently sits at 57 cents per share. That's a compound annual growth rate of 10%, with 2017's dividend increase expected to be similar. After all, AAPL stock only has a payout ratio of 27% of its trailing earnings and a 1.6% yield.When you look at shareholder yield - dividends plus buybacks - Apple's record is even more impressive. The company spent $12.2 billion on dividends and a whopping $29.2 billion on share repurchases in 2016. That works out to a shareholder yield of 5.6%.AAPL is returning capital at a blistering pace.10 Monthly Dividend Stocks to Buy to Pay the BillsHowever, while most shareholders are ecstatic with the dividend on Apple stock, allow me to present an alternate argument:Apple should cut its payout … and maybe even eliminate it altogether.Apple, Meet AlphabetLet's take a minute to compare Apple to one of its peers,Alphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL).Alphabet's dividend policy is pretty clear. It saidin its 2016 10-K filing, ""We have never declared or paid any cash dividend on our common or capital stock. We intend to retain any future earnings and do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.""Alphabet can easily afford a dividend, too. It made $19.5 billion in 2016, or $28.32 per share.The reasoning behind this is simple. Alphabet is aggressively investing in the kinds of projects that can really boost its top line. It has been working on a self-driving car since 2009. It invested more than$6 billion on Google Fiber. Alphabet also teamed up withFidelitytoinvest $1 billion inSpaceX.In total, Alphabet spent $13.9 billion on research and development in 2016, as well as $10.2 billion on capital expenditures.Apple is still investing in the future, but not as aggressively as Alphabet. AAPL spent $10 billion on research and development and $13.5 billion on capital expenditures in 2016, despite making a net profit of $45.7 billion.In other words, Alphabet reinvested $24.1 billion back into its business in 2016 while earning $19.5 billion. Apple reinvested $23.5 billion while earning $45.7 billion. AAPL barely reinvested half of its earnings back into its business.AAPL Needs to Make Some AcquisitionsApple does have some exciting plans. One of the tech world's worst-kept secrets is Apple's plans to somehow be a part of thecar of the future. It has also been working in thevirtual reality space, and many expect big improvements toApple TV. These investments are great. But I don't think they'll be enough to usher in a new era of growth.It's time for Apple to go shopping.Apple could easily take the $41 billion it gave back to shareholders in 2016 and use it to make a huge splash.Say Apple agreed to buyNetflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX) at a 50% premium to today's price - so, roughly $91 billion. AAPL could pay off the deal in just a few years from its existing cash flow alone, and would own a company that has doubled revenues in the last three years.Intel Corporation (INTC) Buys Mobileye NV (MBLY) to Win the Auto MarketApple's main growth driver today is service revenue. In its most recent quarter, AAPL grew its top line 3% on a quarter-over-quarter basis.It grew services revenue by 18%. Acquiring Netflix would would not only supercharge that division, it would give Apple access to Netflix's whole library of content.The Bottom Line on Apple StockThere's a reason why AAPL trades at the same multiple as the rest of the market. Investors assume - rightfully so - that it is a mature company with no immediate growth prospects. If Apple slashed its dividend and announced it was using that money for acquisitions, investors would sit up and take notice.There's no guarantee such sentiment would send Apple stock soaring right away. In fact, it'd be easy to see the market taking the short-term view that something is amiss, and selling AAPL as a result.But if executed right, such a strategy would make Apple shareholders richer in the long run.As of this writing, Nelson Smith did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Can NVIDIA Regain Its Mojo?;3/13/2017;"It seems somewhat disingenuous referring to a stock that has   rallied roughly 530% over the last five years as having ""lost its   mojo.""However, the fact remains that shares of graphics chip leaderNVIDIA(NASDAQ: NVDA) have indeed fallen roughly 18% from their 52-week   high in early February.makeArticleAd();NVDAdata byYCharts.So, how should investors think about this newfound bearishness   in NVIDIA shares? Does the sell-off in its stock represent a   paradigm shift in investor sentiment toward the company, or does   it create an attractive potential entry point? Let's explore this   topic in greater detail.NVIDIA stock: What goes up must come down?The only major news to break since NVIDIA's stock peaked --   which occurred on February 7th -- was the company's release   of its full-year and fourth-quarter results for its fiscal year   2017, which took place on February 9th. As a quick point of   clarification, NVIDIA runs its fiscal year one full year ahead of   the calendar year, for some odd reason.At any rate, NVIDIA actually released earnings that exceeded   analyst estimates in terms of sales and profits.If anything, it seems safe to say that some investors have   been simply taking profits on their NVIDIA investments, a   strategy that seems sensible for short-term investors concerned   about NVDIIA's admittedly rich valuation. Moreover, while it   enjoys many well-defined positives, there is one potential storm   forming on the horizon that could sap some of the wind from   NVIDIA's sails.Long-time graphics laggardAdvanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD) plans to launch its Vega chip series later this   year, a move that some analysts believe could allow AMD to steal   significant market GPU market share from NVIDIA. Though we don't   know any of the specifics regarding AMD's Vega chips yet, the   hope is that they will serve as a cheaper alternative to NVIDIA's   GTX chip series, while not sacrificing much in the way of   performance. If that proves to be the case, NVIDIA could be   forced to lower the prices of corresponding chipsets. Of course,   worrying about this is putting the cart before the horse to a   certain extent, but it bears noting as something that could   inhibit NVIDIA's growth. And given NVIDIA'ssky-high valuation, that could be enough to compel investors sitting on large paper   gains to sell.Image source: NVIDIA.NVIDIA long-term business outlook remains favorableIn as much as NVIDIA has indeed ""lost its mojo,"" it's   important to remember that NVIDIA's multiyear investment thesis   appearsas strong as ever. As we saw in its earnings release, the main drivers   underpinning NVIDIA's growth today are high-end gaming,   artificial intelligence (AI) software, and self-driving cars.eSports still don't receive a lot of coverage from the   mainstream media, but the craze's momentum is undeniable.   eSport's global audience was estimated to reach 256 million   viewers in 2016, according to one industry researcher. Large   events regularly enjoy sponsorship from blue-chip brands likeCoca-Cola,Nissan, and more, which has led to a dramatic increase in purse sizes   for some of the genre's most popular events. This, in turn, has   helped increase the awareness of the pastime to many casual fans,   particularly in Asia, where the sport is most popular. The   same researcher believes total revenue related to eSports will   reach $1.1 billion by 2019, up from $463 million in 2016. The   rush of money and interest into the sport should help continue to   create demand for NVIDIA's best-of-breed graphics processing   chips, which rose 44% last year.Better still, major trends like AI software and driverless   cars remain in their early stages. Last year, NVIDIA saw an   unprecedented surge in demand for its GPUs to power an impressive   host of applications. NVIDIA's GPUs are the chip of choice to   power the various AI projects at tech giants such asMicrosoft,Alphabet,Facebook, the National Cancer Institute, the U.S. Department of Energy,   and many others. Turning to self-driving cars, NVIDIA has also   partnered with an impressive array of major automakers,   though this technology figures to more meaningfully contribute to   its growth early next decade.Not to belabor the point, but hopefully it's clear now that   NVIDIA has far from lost its mojo. True, the company's stock   prices has fallen from its recent all-time highs, but it easily   remains in positive territory over the last 12 months, and for   good reason. NVIDIA is one of the best-positioned companies to   profit from several of the largest continuing trends in   technology.10 stocks we like better than NvidiaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

They weathered the effects of the 2008 financial crisis as well as could be expected. For the last few years we've had record vehicle sales.Therein lies my frustration with this breakout. Everything is going the auto manufacturing industry, yet their stocks have yet to wow us. Ford stock has been in a descending trend for almost two years.Click to EnlargeEquity markets are at all-time highs. With auto sales also at or near record levels, I expect better performance from F stock. For some reason it's mired under $13 and in a descending trend.General Motors Company(NYSE:GM), on the other hand, has enjoyed an ascending 12 month trend.Even so, I still like the Ford trade better.10 Monthly Dividend Stocks to Buy to Pay the BillsTechnically, the recent price action in F stock has been building energy. We see lower highs and higher lows coming to a tight point. This energy needs to resolve itself soon. Unless there is bad news coming from Ford or a general equity correction, the move should be to the upside.If that happens, it could rally 8% to 10%. Today I want to set a pair trade to capture the upside breakout.F Stock Trade IdeaThe Bet:Buy the F May $13 call for 23 cents per contract. This will give me over two months to capture an upside move.To lower my out-of-pocket expenses, I will finance the bet by selling risk against lower levels of Ford that I deem safe given the current environment.The Bank:Sell the F Sept $11 put and collect 35 cents. This is a bullish trade that commits me to buying F stock if price falls below it. I have an 85% theoretical chance of having F stock stay above my sold put. I only sell naked puts if I am willing to own it there.Taking both trades means that I am getting paid to bet on a Ford stock rally. Even if nothing happens, I would be left with a net credit. As long as the price stays above $11 per share, any premium I collect from selling back the May call is pure profit.Since I am not required to hold my trades open through expiration, I can close any of them for partial gains or losses at any time.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director ofSellSpreads.com.

Buy First Solar, Inc. (FSLR) Stock, Make 55% in 18 Months;3/13/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFirst Solar, Inc.(NASDAQ:FSLR) is having a rough go of it. FSLR stock has plummeted as much as 17% since reaching its February high of $38.50, and nowthe solar stock is being booted from theS&P 500.makeArticleAd();Source:U.S. Department of the Interior via FlickrYes, the residential solar installer recently beat Wall Street's fourth-quarter estimates on both the top and bottom lines, and raised its sales guidance for 2017.However, thanks to apre-tax charge of $729 millionduring the quarter, the company reversed last year's Q4 operating income of $131.82 million to a loss of $765.41 million. What's more, investors realized that even though First Solar did beat consensus estimates on the top line with $412.76 million, it still marked a year-over-year decline of 56% from revenue of $942.32 million a year ago.And yet, there's reason to believe FSLR stock could still put up huge gains before 2017 is through.Why the Trouble in First Solar?First Solar's business has been hurt by several factors, including weak economic concerns in China, resulting in slow on solar panel purchases and causing a rise in First Solar's inventory. This was one of the reasons competitors such asTesla, Inc.(NASDAQ:TSLA) opted to acquireSolarCity, shielding the latter from the negative effects of the industry.7 Blue-Chip Stocks Holding You BackAside from these factors, it hasn't helped that President Donald Trump - unlike former President Obama - hasn't embraced renewable or green energy to the extent he has supported the coal industry.Nevertheless, withSunPower Corporation(NASDAQ:SPWR) making some optimistic comments about the state of the solar industry, now's an ideal time to place a bet on FSLR stock, which closed Friday at $32.40, losing 6.4% for the week. At some point, solar energy - which continues to gain global acceptance as it decreases in costs - can't be avoided any longer.And this is where First Solar's restructuring efforts - including plans tocut about 27% of its workforce- make sense.FSLR, which has now beaten earnings estimates in seven straight quarters, sees 2017 net revenue in the range of $2.8 billion to $2.9 billion, which is above its prior range of $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion and higher than the $2.53 billion analyst were looking for. The upbeat revenue forecast means First Solar expects to realize revenue from - among others - the 250-megawatt Moapa project, near Las Vegas.Plus, the company is now diverting cash toward its Series 6 solar modules ahead of schedule to 2018, which offers significantly lower capex than Series 4, while abandoning plans for the Series 5 product. And while the Series 6 products offers more risk, First Solar's nearly $2 billion in cash on the balance sheet (or $19 in cash per share) gives it plenty of time to get it right.Bottom Line for FSLR StockAfter flaming out in 2016, losing some 51% of its value, there's still a lot to like with First Solar stock, which has fallen 56% from its 52-week high of $74.29.Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Android Smartphones Found With Pre-Installed MalwareAssuming the company can execute on its workforce reduction, lowering costs, while accelerating its Series 6 solar modules, FSLR stock could rebound above $50 in the next 12 to 18 months. That would come out to roughly 55% returns - a killing for investors who are looking for a spark in their portfolios.As of this writing, Richard Saintvilus did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceMonday's Vital Data: Bank of America Corp (BAC), Snap Inc (SNAP) and Altria Group Inc (MO)Trade of the Day: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)10 Monthly Dividend Stocks to Buy to Pay the BillsThe postBuy First Solar, Inc.

Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Android Smartphones Found With Pre-Installed Malware;3/13/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMalware made the leap from PCs to smartphones along with users. It's always been known that devices runningAlphabet Inc's(NASDAQ:GOOGL) Android operating system are much more susceptible to being infected thanApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhones. However, the situation may be even worse than we realized.makeArticleAd();Source: Check Point Software TechnologiesA mobile security research team posted on Friday that it scanned devices owned by two large companies and found Android malwarepre-installedon smartphones from 38 different manufacturers.That discovery should concern both corporate IT departments, and consumers. And it once again validates Apple's ""controlling"" iPhone approach.Android Malware Illustrates the Downside of Google's ApproachFrom the launch of the first iPhone in 2007, Apple retained full control of its iOS operating system and installed it only on its own hardware. Apps can only be downloaded from the App Store and these are checked and vetted by Apple engineers.7 Blue-Chip Stocks Holding You BackWith limited hardware configurations, Apple is able to test iOS thoroughly for all iPhone users. The company is aggressive about pushing out new iOS versions (79% of all iPhones are running iOS 10), and in the event of a security issue, it's able to quickly push out system updates to address it.With Android, GOOGL took a very different approach from Apple. It went wide open, licensing Android to dozens of different smartphone manufacturers. Users are free to tinker with the operating system and they can download apps from virtually anywhere - not just Google Play. This open approach helped Google to dominate the smartphone industry, with nine out of 10 new smartphones running Android.But the approach makes smartphone security a nightmare.Android updates often require manufacturer and/or carrier cooperation. As a result,only 2% of Android devices are running the latest version of Android, while the majority are running software that's at least several years out of date.Freedom to install questionable apps plus an older version of the operating system has let Android malware run rampant. At one point it was estimated to account for97% of all mobile malware.Check Point's Pre-Installed Android Malware DiscoveryCheck Point Software Technologies Ltd.(NASDAQ:CHKP), an IT security company, reported in aFriday blog postthat it had scanned the smartphones for two large companies (identified only as ""large telecommunications company"" and a ""multinational technology company"") and discovered Android malware had been pre-installed on smartphones from 38 different hardware manufacturers.Android malware identified ranged from adware to mobile ransomware capable of encrypting all data on the device until a fee is paid to unlock it. Some had been added to the smartphone ROM, meaning reinstalling Android would not remove it. And none of this malware was downloaded by users. The smartphones arrived at the two companies pre-infected, with installation happening ""somewhere along the supply chain.""Some of the most popularAndroid smartphones from 38 different manufacturers were infected, includingSamsung Electronics Co Ltd's(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) best-selling Galaxy S7. Also caught in the sweep was the Nexus 5 - anLGsmartphone co-developed with Google.The Nexus 5 is several years old, but the Android malware discovered on it had been there since the time of delivery.If a smartphone released in cooperation with Google itself is not immune from being infected before it even reaches the user, then Android's smartphone security issue is even bigger than previously thought.Apple's Long-Term AdvantageThis isn't the first time Android malware has made headlines. Last November, Check Point discovered a widespreadinfection of Android smartphones with HummingBad. This Chinese malware was found to have infected over 10 million Android smartphones worldwide.3 Stocks to Watch on Monday: Mobileye NV (MBLY), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) and Boeing Co (BA)And of course, there was the infamousWikiLeaks CIA dumplast week that shone a light on smartphone security and the tools used by government agencies to bypass it. Several dozen Android vulnerabilities were revealed, along with 14 iOS exploits.The difference is, Apple had addressed most of the iPhone issues in iOS 10, which has widespread adoption. Google may have patched Android, but chances are most Android smartphones out there won't get the update and will remain vulnerable. This latest Android malware discovery shows that the weakness to GOOGL's approach extends all the way to the supply chain. Even the most trusted manufacturers are not immune to having their smartphones compromised before the consumer even gets their hands on them.Google's wide-open Android approach has let it build a commanding 90% smartphone marketshare. But with Android malware increasingly in the spotlight and no easy solution in sight, the stage is set for Apple to press its advantage over GOOGL's approach.Apple built its iPhone empire around premium design, ease of use and plentiful apps. But its advantage in smartphone security may turn out to be the factor that lets it eat into Google's Android lead in the long term.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceTrade of the Day: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)An Apple Inc.

3 Great Reasons to Buy Amazon.com Stock;3/12/2017;"Behold, the awe-inspiring rise ofAmazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) stock:AMZNdata byYChartsmakeArticleAd();After the company's two decades of torrid growth, you'd be   excused for thinking its days of market-crushing gains are a   thing of the past. You'd also probably be wrong. In fact, here   are three reasons you may want to buy Amazon's shares today.Image source: Getty Images.1. 91.7%That's the percentage of U.S. retail sales conducted offline.   Said differently, e-commerce sales -- even after years of   staggering growth -- still comprise less than 10% of retail   sales.US E-Commerce Sales as Percent of Retail   Salesdata byYChartsResearch firm eMarketer estimates that global retail   e-commerce sales will increase to more than $4 trillion in 2020,   up from less than $2 trillion in 2016. With millions more people   gaining access to the internet every year, e-commerce appears set   to grow at a rapid pace for at least another decade, and probably   much longer. Amazon stands to benefit from this megatrend perhaps   more than any other company.2. Shopping = AmazonAmazon is growing increasingly synonymous with the word   ""shopping"" in the minds of consumers.Fifty-five percent of consumers begin their search on the   retail titan's website when shopping online in September -- up   from 44% a year earlier -- according to areport(opens a PDF) by marketing firm BloomReach. During that   time, the share of shoppers whose searches originated at all   other retailers' sites combined fell from 21% to only 16%.Amazon is also taking share from search engines. The   percentage of customers who began their product hunts on search   sites declined to 28% from 34%. These developments haven't   escaped the attention ofAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) subsidiary Google, which has named   Amazon itsNo. 1 competitor.This powerful trend is a testament to Amazon's increasingly   dominant consumer mindshare. Moreover, investors should expect   these figures to continue their ascent in the coming years, as   Amazon's competitors continue to struggle.3. Brick-and-mortar bloodbathIn addition to its retail search rankings, Amazon's dominance   can also be seen in its utter dismantling of traditional   retailers.After reporting weak holiday sales,J.C. Penney(NYSE: JCP)  recently announced that it will close 130 to   140 stores, which represents 13% to 14% of the struggling   retailer's current store base. J.C Penney Chairman and CEO Marvin   Ellison directly acknowledged that the growth of e-commerce was a   primary reason for the closures. ""We believe closing stores will   also allow us to adjust our business to effectively compete   against the growing threat of online retailers,"" Ellison   said.Another struggling retailer,Sears Holdings(NASDAQ: SHLD) , plans to close 150 Sears and Kmart stores in an   effort to cut $1 billion in costs in 2017. Sears has been   downsizing its store base and selling off many of itsmost valuable assetsin hopes of preserving liquidity and remaining solvent. But in   the face of plunging same-store sales, mounting losses, and   dwindling cash reserves, Sears Holdings' daysappear to be numbered.You can add to this list of besieged retailersMacy's,Kohl's,Abercrombie & Fitch,andOffice Depot-- all of which have closed stores in response to the relentless   onslaught of the Amazon.com-led e-commerce revolution. In doing   so, a clear picture emerges: Retailers of all types arelosing shareto the mighty Amazon -- and some may not survive.As its competitors fade away, Amazon stands to claim the   spoils. The online retail juggernaut is positioned to capture a   huge swath of the rapidly growing global e-commerce market as its   rivals crumble by the wayside. In turn, its stock should continue   to deliver handsome gains to shareholders in the years ahead.

Voice: The Next Computing Empire;3/11/2017;"This article is the first in a two-part series aimed at     exploring the rapidly developing state of voice computing from     the investor's perspective. In Part I, I discuss why it's now     increasingly clear that the human voice will become society's     next major computing interface, and why it will continue     proliferating through our homes and businesses. In Part II,     I'll dive deeper into the new and emerging business models. In     Part II, I'll discuss the various players involved in the race     to commercialize the technology -- those best-positioned to     profit today, those positioning themselves to thrive tomorrow,     and those dropping the ball entirely. I'll also dive deeper     into the fascinating business models voice computing will soon     enable, and how those models will evolve as the technology     continues to improve.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();For nearly 40 years, we've seen the computer evolve into an   indispensable accessory of Western society driven by three   powerful technologies that defined their eras and played a   monumental role for investors along the way.The personal computer gave many of us our first glimpse at the   digital world, normalizing the idea that such machines have a   place in our homes and everyday lives. The internet tapped us   into that world, offering us endless floods of information,   entertainment, and commerce around which we willingly began   shaping our civilization. And then the smartphone encouraged us   to take that digital world everywhere we go, leaving nothing but   a few taps on a touchscreen between us, our computers, and   constant immersion.Now, a fourth technology -- voice computing--is removing that last barrier.Reimagining the roles computers playImagine driving down the highway, coming home from work, and     without taking your hands off the wheel or hitting any buttons,     asking your car to turn up the heat in your house, preheat the     oven for dinner, and play your favorite album, all in the same     breath. Picture negotiating with a street vendor in Beijing,     having your phone translate the entire conversation between     Mandarin and English out loud, so you can haggle in real time.     Or how about a stuffed animal that can tell your daughter     interactive stories every night before bed, reshaping the     adventure at every twist and turn based on her responses and     reactions.These aren't hypothetical scenarios -- they're happening     right now.The human voice is well on its way to becoming the next     major medium we use to interact with computers, and as we'll     explore in this two-part series,voicecomputingis the burgeoning field of technology making it possible.     Already spanning multiple consumer and enterprise ventures     (think call center routing, digital dictation, or the virtual     assistants on smartphones), the industry's ultimate aim is     enabling people to carry on hands-free, conversational-style     interactions with computers.It's an ambitious prospect capable of significantly     expanding the roles computers play in our everyday lives, but     it's also one that appears inevitable when considering the     trajectory computers have taken, without fail, since their     introduction, evolving in shape and form around contemporary     technology to solve unmet needs.Image Source: Getty ImagesAnd yet voice computing's evolution is different. Unlike any     form of computing to come before it, the technology bypasses     the physical realm, allowing users to query the internet,     manage their surroundings, and connect to third-party services     without ever having to touch a physical device -- all in the     time it takes to form a sentence.If that sounds unnecessary, then consider just how limitless     the applications could be. From the surgeon who needs to     rapidly adjust the conditions of her operating room     mid-procedure, to the disabled veteran who simply hopes to     access the appliances in his home. The sheer number of everyday     applications for such a technology has prompted Grand View     Research to project the global market for voice recognition     technology will reach $128 billion annually by 2024, an     estimate that may undershoot the overall economic opportunity     at play considering the potential verticals include healthcare,     defense, entertainment, consumer goods, and more (I'll discuss     these in more detail in Part II).There is one thing we can be certain of, however. Voice     computing is extremely likely to transform the way we interact     with technology in society, but before that can happen, a     large-scale societal shift toward adopting the interface must     occur, a shift thatcannotoccur until several key hurdles are overcome.Understanding the challenges aheadTo analyze those obstacles, let's turn to the most       promising application of voice-driven technology today:       virtual digital assistants.Data Sources: Socratic Technologies, Vantiv, Statista.         Chart by AuthorThanks to the success of the iPhone andApple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) other devices, Siri is currently the most       wildly used virtual assistant in the United States, but until       recently, it's also perfectly exemplified what's holding       voice computing back. To put it simply, speaking with Siri       can often feel more like a novelty than a time-saver, a       sentiment shared not just among Apple users, but most       smartphone owners with access to similar voice computing       technology.It's a problem we can break down into three fundamental       hurdles.The first is that users must often resort to awkward       combinations of hyper-specific phrasing and hurried       robo-speak to have their speech accurately recognized. Andrew       Ng, chief scientist atBaidu(NASDAQ: BIDU) and one the most respected names in the field,       perhaps put it best in 2015 when he noted, ""Speech       recognition, depending on the circumstances, is say 95 per       cent accurate. So maybe it gets one word in 20 wrong. That's       really annoying if it gets one in 20 wrong and you probably       don't want to use it very often. That's probably where speech       recognition is today.""The second hurdle is that even when our speech iscorrectlyrecognized, there still remains a strong chance it will bemisinterpretedwhile undergoing natural language understanding, a process in       which the assistant attempts to comprehend what we want using       the sequence of words (and eventually, the tone, pace, and       inflection) we give. And even if that speech is correctly       understood, an assistant may still simply be unable to solve       for the request due to technical constraints. Examples of       both cases can be seen in the screenshot below, along with a       sense of how frustrating the encounter can be.Image Source: Author's iPhoneEncounters like these make us feel as though we're wasting       our time trusting our phones to do what we could have done       ourselves with only a little more effort upfront. Over time,       they build up, eventually discouraging us from even tryingto       use our assistants for anything complex, instead relying on       them only for the most trivial of tasks, like setting alarms       or creating reminders.Thankfully, these first two hurdles are solvable with data,   third-party partnerships, and time, each of which the major   players in this space have been actively accruing for years.   Returning to our example, since Siri was introduced to the world   in 2011, virtual assistants have grown far more capable of   correctly interpreting requests thanks to advances in deep   learning, a thriving field of AI being utilized byAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) ,Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) , Baidu, and others to improve speech recognition,   natural language understanding, and other components of voice   computing at astounding rates. (Click herefor an outstanding story byThe New York Timeson Google's significant role in making this happen).Equally as important, decisions by Apple and its competitors   to open their platforms up to third-party services have made   today's voice-based assistants feel far more capable than in   years past. These decisions allow Siri, for example, to call you   a ride using your Uber account, or order a pizza through your   storedDomino'sinformation -- not unlike anactualsecretary would do.As the potential behind voice computing becomes increasingly   obvious in the coming months and years, we should expect more and   more third parties to hop on board, eventually expanding the   scope of what a partnership could entail (instead of ordering an   Uber, imagine ordering a plane ticket). One look at the rate of   growth for third-party commands available on Amazon's voice-based   assistant, Alexa, can tell us a lot.Data Source: Voicebot. Chart by AuthorWith time, these technical achievements and partnerships will   continue compounding, eventually making for a highly practical   voice computing experience. Even marginal improvements in the   technology will convince users to begin using voice as an   interface more frequently. In the same talk regarding the current   state of the voice industry, Ng went on to say, ""I think that as   speech recognition accuracy goes from say 95 per cent to 98, 99   to 99.9, all of us in the room will go from barely using it   today, to using it all the time."" He added, ""Most people   underestimate the difference between 95 and 99 per cent ... 99   per cent is a game changer.""Although we're not yet able to predict when the technology   will reach that point, if the recent pace of progress is any   indication -- since Ng's speech, Baidu has built a program   capable of dictating English three times faster, and with 20%   less errors, than human beings -- it won't be much longer.In the meantime, an arguably far more important hurdle stands   in the way. It's a problem shared by every other major computing   medium in use today, only voice is actually solving for it.An instantaneous computing experienceNo matter the medium, we've always interacted with computers   by issuing commands. In the 1950s, we meticulously punched those   commands into cards before feeding them into hulking machines.   Now, technology allows us to simply type, click, and,   increasingly, speak them and expect a result.Yet despite these advancements, today's mediums still subject   users to a unique set of delays, a sort of friction that   inherently slows down the process betweenthinkinga command and actually being able tocommunicatethat command to your devices. A decade ago, that friction most   likely entailed tracking down a PC with internet, using the mouse   to open a browser, using the keyboard to run a search, and then   sorting for the result. But today, for most Americans, it simply   means reaching into our pockets for our phone, scrolling with our   thumb, and tapping away.It's a process so effortless, the average American now checks   their phone an estimated 46 times per day. It's even become   fashionable to argue there's no longerenoughfriction separating society from our devices; that we'retooplugged in to the digital world.So when you consider that voice computing's primary advantage   iseliminatingfriction, it becomes tempting to dismiss the technology as a   solution to a trivial problem. What that argument critically   fails to consider, however, is that friction is about more than   simple convenience, and that any amount of friction, no matter   how small, fundamentally limits the dynamic between a user and   their computing medium in two ways.Let's take the smartphone for example.Image Source: PixabayThe seemingly trivial motions we make when reaching for our   phone still require us to be in immediate proximity of the   device. We have to walk over to kitchen counter if we left our   phone there; we have to remember it's on the counter even before   we can do that. Then, once we've reached our phone, we're   required to physically handle it, a process that generally   requires we have one hand free and able.That may not sound like much, but these limitations force our   computing experience to revolve around the location of our   device, as opposed to it revolving around us.They can create roadblocks for those with disabilities affecting   their vision or hands (or really, even those who just have sticky   hands, wet hands, or their hands full), those far away from their   device, and most importantly, those with an immediate computing   need.There's a reason speech is our most instinctual form of   communication.If we have a question, and if we know those around us can   answer that question, we don't pull out our phone and run a   search, we open our mouths and ask. We do that because it's   instantaneous. Now contrast that with having to locate your   phone, having to type in your password, having to navigate to an   app, having to tap, type, or speak your command. These behaviors   are not instinctual,but we put up with them because the people around us usually   don't have the answers, and because smartphones are our best   alternative.But they don't have to be.The rise of voiceIt's not obvious quite yet, but today's physically bound   mediums have left a large hole to fill and voice computing is   starting to fill it.Over the past two years, the technology has begun manifesting   itself in the form of always-on, always-listening devices able to   virtually bypass the friction inherent in today's major computing   mediums. Currently, these devices are best exemplified by   Amazon's line of Echo smart speakers, which employ far-field   voice recognition technology allowing users to command Alexa from   across multiple rooms and through various background noises at   any time simply by calling for it out loud.Image Source: Amazon.com.Put another way, for as little as $50, Amazon's Echo is giving   consumers their first glimpse at a frictionless computing   experience. Following its initial setup, there's no pressing   buttons, no looking around for the device, and no navigating   through screens to issue a command. When it works correctly (like   Siri, Alexa is still very much in its infancy and subject to   misinterpreting commands) it really does allow users to convert   their thoughts to a command in the time it takes to form a   sentence, capturing the essential promise of voice as a   medium.And if the early estimated adoption rate for the device is any   indication -- Amazon hasn't officially released sales   figures, but as of January 2016, Consumer Intelligence Research   Partners (CIRP) estimates a staggering 8.2 million Echos have   already been sold in the U.S. (a number that pales in comparison   to Morgan Stanley's estimates of over 11 million), suggesting the   device has achieved well over 5% household penetration -- early   demand for a seamless computing experience is strong, and will   likely grow stronger as capable competitors race to introduce   their own offerings (see Google's Home,Nvidia's(NASDAQ: NVDA) Spot, or Baidu's Little Fish), and as voice   recognition, natural language understanding, and third-party   support continue improving at rapid pace.Data Sources: VoiceLabs, CIRP, KPCB, InfoScout. *2017     figures are VoiceLab projections. Chart by AuthorTo be clear, these devices will never replace today's existing   computing mediums, but will rather augment them. While   screens will remain the preferred medium for our more detailed   and visual computing needs, voice will begin its ascent by taking   on an increasing share of our more ""conversational"" demands,   common requests we want addressed with the immediacy we expect   from dialogue (""Cancel my doctor's appointment."" ""Pause that   music!"" ""What's a good non-fiction book to read on the beach? ...   Great, order that one."")As the technology grows capable of handling increasingly   nuanced and complex requests, and as voice-enabled devices   proliferate and evolve, we can expect more users to grow   comfortable engaging with the technology around the home, in the   workplace, and gradually more pervasive aspects of society.Andthat'swhere the real opportunities begin.The opportunity at handSome of the biggest tech empires in modern history have been   built around the personal computer, internet, and smartphone,   each of which has provided the infrastructure for technology to   penetrate deeper and more reflexively into everyday life,   allowing creative companies to reach consumers in entirely new   ways.In just 10 years, the iPhone helped Apple grow to become the   largest corporation in the world, but it also popularized   smartphone technology in the U.S., helping to create the   infrastructure that in turn enabledFacebook(NASDAQ: FB) ,Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) , Alphabet, Uber,Snap, Amazon,Shopify(NYSE: SHOP) , and countless others to create businesses that   reach deeper into our lives than any before.Image Source: Author's iPhoneAnd yet voice technology is going deeper.It's becoming an invisible, always-listening medium that   surrounds us, weaving itself more seamlessly into the fabric of   our lives than any before it. It's called on using our most   instinctual, reflexive form of communication, and it's accessible   in the time it takes to form words. It's a technology that   provides tomorrow's innovators a far more intimate and pervasive   way to help us satisfy our digital wants.It's a startling but increasingly inevitable reality for both   investors and society.In Part II: The Playing Field, I'll discuss various players   involved in the race to commercialize voice computing.

The 5 Biggest Challenges to the Driverless Car Revolution;3/11/2017;"The year 2017 is gearing up to be a momentous year for the   driverless car race. But despite major initiatives by   megacorporationsAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) ,Tesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA) , and others, there are major road blocks ahead   for the driverless car revolution. A recentMcKinseyreport highlights five of them.1. PricingNo matter how incredible an innovation might be, it's useless   if it's not affordable. Although Alphabet's Waymo has clocked   more than 2 million road miles in its autonomous vehicles,   McKinsey estimates that self-driving cars are ""unlikely to be   available before 2020."" Alphabet and others are inching closer to   commercializing their products. A partnership withFiat Chrysler Automobiles NV(NYSE: FCAU) will, for the first time, take Alphabet's autonomous   driving technology out of its peculiar ""panda car"" and into 100   Pacifica Hybrid minivans in early 2017. But those minivans aren't   for sale, and, if they were, would probably cost magnitudes more   than an average minivan.2. Consumer UnderstandingmakeArticleAd();Video source: Waymo viaYouTubeEven if driverless cars become affordable, no one will buy   them if they don't understand them. That means that self-driving   car companies need to educate consumers on the advantages of   autonomous vehicles. Informational videos like the one above   produced by Alphabet's Waymo are an important start, and others   like Tesla Motors are producing their ownvideo vignettesto make self-driving cars salient. Tesla Motors and others have a   clear business incentive to make self-driving seem mainstream,   and the more that their message is spread, the brighter the   future for their sales and sustainability.3. Safety/Security issuesConsumer understanding goes hand in hand with a major concern   about autonomous technology -- safety and security. At no point   was this clearer than in May 2016, when Tesla Motors reported the   first driver fatality while its Autopilot technology was engaged.   The tragic crash occurred when neither the driver nor Tesla   Motors' technology recognized a truck's white-colored trailer   crossing its path on a highway. There will certainly be more   tragedies in the future of autonomous vehicles, and it will   remain a continuing challenge and the highest priority for   self-driving car companies to minimize safety and security   issues. However, it's also important to remember that these   high-profile cases can cause over-reactions, and sticking to   statistics can help investors, companies, and consumers alike   identify the best autonomous option for investing, manufacturing,   and purchasing.4 & 5: Regulation and TechnologyAs with all new innovations, regulation and technology can   make or break a revolution. The McKinsey report is quick to note   that regulation is a hurdle, rather than a never-ending issue. It   makes sense, then, that Ford, Alphabet, Lyft, Uber, and Volvo   Cars have all joined together to create the ""Self-Driving Coalition for Safer Streets."" Rather than rally for ""wild west"" free market competition,   these companies want to see a sensible framework of standardized   regulation upon which they can confidently build their new   business units.Technology isn't a hurdle, but there is a minimum threshold   below which driverless cars will never be the norm. Companies   like Alphabet's Waymo and Tesla Motors are aiming for full   autonomy, while others are taking the more step-wise approach of   offering semi-autonomous additions like Audi's ""Traffic Jam   Assist."" The McKinsey report estimates that, once regulation and   technology issues have been resolved, ""up to 15 percent of new   cars sold in 2030 could be fully autonomous.""Hit the brakes?Image Source: Getty Images.2017 will not be the year self-driving cars take over our   roads. Pricing, consumer understanding, safety/security,   regulation, and technology issues will continue to impede this   industry's revolution. But Alphabet, Tesla Motors, and others are   making steady gains on addressing these issues, and the ultimate   widespread adoption of autonomous technology is almost   inarguable. Forward-looking investors with long-term horizons   should acknowledge these issues, select their self-driving stocks   accordingly, and sit back to enjoy this multi-year market road   trip.10 stocks we like better than Wal-MartWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock     tip, it can pay to listen.

What Snap Inc Wants From Drones;3/10/2017;"Recently public social media companySnap(NYSE: SNAP)  has been making a few head-scratcher decisions with their marketing strategies lately, not the least of which is its growing interest in drone technology. While it makes sense for companies likeAppleandGoogle(NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG)  to pour money into moonshot technology projects, it's a bit more of a confusing move for Snap to make.In this clip fromIndustry Focus: Tech, tech sector bureau chief Dylan Lewis and contributor Evan Niu talk about what Snap might possibly want from their investment in drones, a few reasons why putting so much money and time into drones is probably ill-advised, and more.makeArticleAd();A full transcript follows the video.10 stocks we like better than GoProWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade,Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has tripled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy right now... and GoPro wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.Click hereto learn about these picks!*Stock Advisor returns as of February 6, 2017This podcast was recorded on March 3, 2017.Dylan Lewis:The next piece of news we're going to talk about is even more bizarre. According to reports fromThe New York Times, the company had other hardware ambitions, namely drones. At the moment, details are scarce, but several anonymous sources at the company confirmed Snap has been pursuing a drone camera project. I guess the thought here is, drones would allow aerial Snaps, it would allow people to capture video and images in a more novel way and a cool landscape way. Again, this seems kind of crazy to me, for this to be the focus.Evan Niu:[laughs] Yeah. It makes no sense to me. As ridiculous as the Spectacle thing is, trying to brand a company around those, the drone thing also makes no sense to me. It's hard to imagine someone buying a drone. First of all, it's hard to imagine Snap coming out with a drone that is competitive with what's already out there from DJI and evenGoPro. Look at even GoPro trying to get into drones -- they've had a lot of trouble. A company like GoPro that had experience making cameras still has trouble making a really compelling drone that has all the full features that people expect nowadays.Lewis:They famously had to recall one of their products, because they were having trouble with it.Niu:Yeah, because the battery was loose. If you shook it, the battery would move by a millimeter and the contacts would lose power, which is a really simple and kind of embarrassing problem. It was such a silly little mistake, and it probably had something to do with their manufacturing or something, I don't know. But yeah, the point being, GoPro hasn't really pulled off the drone thing very well either. And they were probably much better-positioned to make that kind of jump in the first place. And, of course, this is just a report that they're working on. Who knows if they actually do it. I hope they realize that it's a bad idea, and probably save everyone a bunch of headaches if they just don't do it at all. I mean, I guess it's not surprising that they have looked into it, since they want to become a camera company. But whether or not they actually do it, I think the chances are probably against it. I would hope so.Lewis:Yeah. I get that, it's tempting to be a tech company and have these really sexy side project. You see the stuff that Alphabet has done with Google's self-driving cars. That is so far afield from their core search property. Even getting into virtual reality on the hardware side with Oculus. But, you look at those two companies, those are businesses that have a cash cow underlying all of these futuristic R&D projects. Their core platforms, their ad-selling platforms are doing wonders for them, and are allowing them to throw money off on the side, and see what happens with these more futuristic, hard-to-pin-down-what-the-impact-might-be type projects. I think with Snap right now, there's a little bit of a focus concern on my end, because you haven't really figured out your core platform yet, you haven't monetized it really well. You're still rolling ads into it and building it into the user experience. And, you have like 3% quarter-to-quarter user growth. You have so many issues with what should be your core focus, I'm not really sure why they're doubling down on their hardware initiatives, if this is something they're really spending a lot of time on.Niu:That's a good point, I agree completely. Why aren't they focusing on getting the core business up and running in a good way? They're just now really rolling out these ads. Of course, in advertising, your ability to target ads is really critical in delivering value to your advertisers, who are the actual customers. That's who pays you.Facebookdoes a really good job with ad targeting because they have so much of your data.Twitter, I think, has had some troubles, which is partially why they're not monetizing as well as they should be. So, I guess the question is, how much user data can Snap really get, and how valuable will that be? Most of the stuff you're putting on Snapchat disappears immediately. What kind of data can they gather that's going to be really useful to turn around and use for targeting? It's kind of the same thing with Twitter. A lot of times, people can view tweets publicly without having to sign in, which limits Twitter's ability to gather data on them, which is also why it's harder for them to monetize their users. It's a big question on execution going forward, how they can really grow this ad business. If they can, this will do well. They are very new to this.Lewis:Yeah, it's something that I think they really have to figure out still. You look at the data points that Facebook and Google have on their users, and you're right, it's totally different, the profile is so robust for what people have on their Facebook. They know all my interests, they know everything I like, and they're able to incorporate that into the algorithms they're using to feed stuff up to me. Google knows exactly what you're searching for, and can serve up hyper-relevant stuff. With Snap, they know your friends, they know your demographic, and maybe they know some of the outlets that you're typically interested in on the story side. But I think they still need to do a ton to figure that out, and I'd rather see them doubling down there than going further afield with some of these hardware projects.Niu:Yeah. The big emphasis on hardware in general is confounding to me. I don't understand why they're doing it, or why they're trying to make this pivot -- if you want to call it a pivot. They should just get down to working on their actual ad platform, focus on the software-as-a-service stuff, before they really start dabbling in this hardware stuff. Hardware is hard.Lewis:And the way that their hardware is set up, too, their Spectacles are built-in to integrate with Snapchat. They're not really a device that you can use across platforms.Niu:Well, you can export, and it exports in a circular format as opposed to the square format that most people see. So, there is a way that you can export content that you take on Spectacles. But, yeah, the point is, you would think they would want to tie exclusively to the platform. But then, it's like, why would you buy some product that's only available for this platform? Conversely, if it's not a good product, if it works on all platforms, why would you buy it unless it's the best product out there? It's this really weird Catch 22. Imagine, would you buy a product that could only submit stuff to Facebook? It doesn't make any sense. But that would be the differentiating factor. But yeah, their whole strategy makes no sense to me.Lewis:Yeah, it seems a little backwards. The point that I was going to make is just, the biggest salesman for the hardware stuff is going to be people being on the platform in general. The addressable market for those products is going to be whatever the user base that they have is. Right now, it's around 160 million daily active users. The most compelling way to make that hardware business look appetizing is to continue to grow that user base, then maybe you have people that want something that's a little bit more dedicated. I'm still skeptical of that. But ultimately, that logic ties back to, build the platform out and grow the user base, and worry about hardware second, right?Niu:Yeah, I agree.Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.Dylan Lewisowns shares of Alphabet (A shares), Apple, and Facebook.Evan Niu, CFAowns shares of Apple and Facebook.Evan Niu, CFAhas the following options: long January 2018 $120 calls on Facebook.

Sears Holdings Corp (SHLD) Soars Amid Potential for More Closings;3/10/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSears Holdings Corp(NASDAQ:SHLD) shares were up by double digits on Friday amid what appears to be optimism over the possibility of more store closures prompting a short squeeze in SHLD stock.makeArticleAd();Source:Mike Mozart via FlickrSears is coming off afourth-quarter beat on the top and bottom lines, but with still-horrid numbers. Revenues in Q4 were down more than 16% to $6.1 billion, and the company lost $607 million.Nonetheless, SHLD stock rebounded by 7%-plus Thursday, and now is up another 15% on Friday.Business Insider's Hayley Peterson writes that the company's conference call points to thepossibility of more store closings and sales. CFO Jason Hollar said:""We have a valuable real estate portfolio, which at the end of the fourth quarter comprised 1,050 leases with significant optionality, as well as 380 owned stores, many in prominent locations. We will continue to assess opportunities to right-size our store footprint and inventory levels aligned to our ongoing transformation to an asset-light integrated retail model.""Hayley surmises that ""By highlighting the leases with optionality, Hollar seems to be suggesting the point that Sears can find ways to either partially or entirely get out of those leases before they expire. Meanwhile, the owned stores can be sold for cash.""3 Short Squeeze Stocks That Are Ready to Fly MUCH HigherSHLD has knocked its store count down by nearly 600 stores over the past five years as it tries to repay debt amid a failure to turn around the core business.The short-term optimism in SHLD stock appears to be scaring what is an overwhelmingly bearish crowd. Roughly 84% of Sears' float was sold short as of the most recent data, good for a short ratio of 8.52 - basically, it would take more than eight days' worth of selling at average volumes to clear out all the bearish bets on SHLD.As of this writing, Robert Martin did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceSnap Inc (SNAP) Stock Is the Perfect Buy at This PriceHow to Trade Apple Inc.

Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Is More Expensive Than Alphabet Inc (GOOGL);3/10/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIt's not by much, but it's there.Alphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL), the parent of Google, was valued at 30.35 times last year's earnings as the market opened March 10.Microsoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT), the parent of Windows, was valued at 30.48 times earnings.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockSeen solely through the prism of financial reports, this makes no sense. Microsoft revenue for its fiscal 2016 was its lowest in three years. Alphabet's margins remain superior and its top line was up 20% in 2016 - ""The Google"" recorded more revenues than ""Mister Softy"" for its most recent fiscal year.Why all the investor love for MSFT stock?Credit the transformation engineered by CEO Satya Nadella, and a new enterprise buying cycle. Simply put, the cloud is where the action is, and Microsoft has essentially becomeInternational Business Machines Corp.(NYSE:IBM), the default choice for running cloud applications.Cloud App DominanceEnterprises - that is large businesses, governments and institutions - are finally moving to the cloud in the form of cloud applications. These include software used for collaboration, marketing, planning, human resources, and for information management.7 Future Blue-Chip Stocks You Need to BuyThe importance of this market, and its potential, can be seen in the recent action of IBM. Its revenues and margins improved dramatically during its most recent quarter, and the stock has risen 28% over the last year. IBM's price-to-earnings metric is still in the mid-teens, but if it can keep the top-line momentum growing when it reports next month, it could be a buy.Synergy Research writes this week, however, thatMicrosoft is leading the enterprise application charge. They are a leader in half the niches identified by the research company, the only cloud software firm identified in more than one area.The one area where GOOGL is even competitive, writes Synergy, is cloud collaboration, shared office applications like Microsoft Office 365 and, on Google's side, the G Suite. Microsoft took the overall market lead in the second quarter of last year and has not looked back.You can start to see the turn in the last few quarterly reports. MSFT revenues of $24.09 billion were up nearly 20% from the previous quarter's $20.45 billion, and more than 20% of that money hit the net income line. Alphabet had more revenue, $26.06 billion, but slightly less of that money fell to net income.Remember: What matters with stocks isn't what you did, but what you're doing, and what you can be expected to do. Expectations for MSFT stock are suddenly sky-high. Thus Microsoft's earnings are worth more.This week, Alphabet tried to halt that momentum at its Google Cloud Next event. How well it succeeded won't be known for some time, although it wasmaking big claims.That Google faces a challenge an enterprise challenge in cloud, however, is now undeniable. It's why the company did an ""acqui-hire"" of VMware co-founderDiane Greenein 2015, making her the head of Google Cloud in 2015, three years after joining the parent company's board.Experts Like BothInvestorPlacewriters are clued-in to the Microsoft momentum, which has the stock up 24% over the last year, outstripping Alphabet's 17% gain.Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

Note than a handful of AMD's competitors are now becoming partners.3 Things AMD Still Has Going For ItWhile investors had high expectations for Ryzen, the future for Advanced Micro Devices isn't dependent on it. In fact, there are three other areas that may end up meaning even more for its top and bottom lines.9 Stocks to Buy That Are Growing Faster Than AmazonIn no particular order …Penetrating the Cloud Market:While AMD has always had a presence in most key tech markets, cloud computing was never a key one for the company. That's changing now though… a ball that got rolling just in the past few weeks. In November,Alphabet Inc's(NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google division tapped AMD,looking to add its graphical processor units to Google's machine learning architecture.It's a curious development, as GPU chips weren't designed to do anything more than handle a computer's display screen. As it turns out, though, its GPUs are very capable of parallel computing, which is a critical aspect of this new cloud-based function.In the meantime,Microsoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) selected AMD processors to power its next-generation open course cloud platform.At stake is a piece of the cloud infrastructure market worth an estimated $300 billion per year.More Licensing Revenue:It's only an unconfirmed rumor thus far, but a reasonably credible one. That is,Intel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) is reportedly interested in using AMDs Radeon graphics technology to power Intel's integrated GPUs in future computers … displacingNvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA). The agreement between Nvidia and Intel ends at the end of March.At the very least, the prospect of such an IP licensing deal could mean a couple hundred million dollars in annual high-margin revenue. If Intel really wants to step up its game, though, it could help fund improvements in the way its CPUs handle graphics.New GPUs Will Enhance New CPU Revenue:While the reviews for the new Ryzen processor have been mixed, AMD stock holders should bear in mind that they're only half the next generation of hardware for Advanced Micro Devices.The other half of the one-two punch combination for AMD this year is the new Vega GPU, which should be unveiled around the middle of this year.As was noted back on Feb. 7:""Vega, is a second-generation high bandwidth memory (or HBM2) design found on a stacked-memory architecture that performs significantly better than the more common GDDR5 (double data rate type-five) utilized by most graphics processing units today. An essentially-infinite amount of memory can be dedicated to handling the display - the maximum virtualization is capped at a ridiculous 512 terabytes. This platform is about twice as powerful as most current alternatives, and will make Advanced Micro Devices competitive with the newest generation of GPU architecture from Nvidia, called Pascal.""More important, Vega was largely built with the Ryzen processor in mend, with each getting the most performance out of one another.Snap Inc (SNAP) Stock Is the Perfect Buy at This PriceIn the meantime, it's not like the Ryzen CPU is a lost cause.As the company's CEO Lisa Su recently explained, ""We hear people on wanting to see improved 1080p performance and we fully expect that Ryzen performance in 1080p will only get better as developers get more time with 'Zen.' We have over 300+ developers now working with 'Zen' and several of the developers for Ashes of Singularity and Total [War:] Warhammer are actively optimizing now.""Bottom Line for AMD StockAs encouraging as the future may be for the company whether or not Ryzen ends up performing well, there's still no denying that AMD stock is overbought and ripe for some profit-taking; that 16% dip is nothing compared to 2016's huge rally.But don't confuse any future weakness from AMD as evidence of what's in store, results-wise, from the company. Advanced Micro Devices is very well positioned for a great 2017. The trick is just being patient enough to wait for a truly palatable entry price. That could still be well below the recent low.In other words, you don't want to step into AMD stock for the long haul until it's almost uncomfortable to do so. We aren't there yet.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace3 Reasons Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

Why Excluding Snap From the S&P 500 Is a Big Deal;3/9/2017;"Snap's(NYSE: SNAP) decision to issue non-voting shares through its   IPO may already have cost it billions of dollars in investor   support.A group of institutional investors have approached stock index   providers S&P Dow Jones Indices and MSCI to bar the shares   from becoming part of several major indexes. Their argument is   that one of the criteria for inclusion in the indexes is ""a   corporate governance structure consistent with U.S. practice.""   Snap's corporate structure is quite unusual, with the founders   holding about 90% of the voting rights, and average investors   holding no votes at all.Excluding Snap shares from the S&P 500 may not sound like   a big deal -- it doesn't affect the underlying fundamentals of   the company. But the growing popularity of index funds and ETFs   means Snap will miss out on billions of dollars of buyer support   that early investors may have been expecting down the road.makeArticleAd();Image source: Spectacles.com.$6 trillion and growingIndex funds and ETFs are expected to overtake actively managed   investments in the next seven years or so, according to Moody's.   Currently, investors have plowed $6 trillion in assets into the   passive investments. $2 trillion of those assets track the   S&P 500 index.Getting added to the S&P 500 is a big deal. WhenAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) was added to the S&P 500, it   received an immediate 7% bump in its share price.Facebook(NASDAQ: FB) received a 4% boost upon the news that it would have   a place in the index.What's more, the stocks continued to benefit for some time as   active funds that are benchmarked against the index were   compelled to buy more shares of the heavily weighted stocks.   Alphabet and Facebook are two of the largest companies in the   S&P 500. Snap, with its market cap floating around $30   billion, would be more moderately weighted than both, but it   would still see similar benefits.Snap knew this was a possibilityIn Snap's S-1 filing with the SEC, it wrote that it couldn't   predict whether its decision to make its Class A shares   non-voting ""will result in adverse publicity or other adverse   consequences."" Certainly, it saw it as a possibility, and it even   noted that no other company has made an IPO with non-voting   shares.While Snap's capital structure is different from those of most   U.S. companies, it's worth noting that it's not the only company   with non-voting shares. In fact, Alphabet has two publicly traded   share classes -- one voting and one non-voting -- and it's   included in the S&P 500. Likewise, Facebook plans to issue   two non-voting (Class C) shares to current shareholders of any   class under its approved stock split plan.But the fact that investors cannot buy voting shares of Snap   on the open market makes its situation unique.How will it impact investors?While having buyer support in the form of institutional   investors is a nice insurance policy, it's not the only thing   that matters. After all, the primary driver of a stock's value is   the underlying company's performance. If Snap can continue   growing its user base and revenue at a rapid clip, the share   price should inevitably climb to meet its fundamental   performance.There are a lot of question marks surrounding Snap, especially   in light of the recent slowdown in user growth seemingly brought   on by the increased intensity of Facebook's competition. The   potential for several major indexes to exclude the stock make it   even riskier.10 stocks we like better than Snap Inc.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

"Get Your ""MPA"" in Deep Learning";3/9/2017;"Big happenings in AI land recently as new supercomputers get built and Einstein meets Watson. Both events were announced on March 6, 2017 and old Big Blue,IBM, finds itself at the center of all of this, still as relevant as the day Deep Blue beat Garry Kasparov in 1996.The supercomputer comes from Fujitsu who is using 24NVIDIA (NVDA)DGX-1 AI systems to help build a supercomputer for RIKEN, Japan's largest comprehensive research institution, for deep learning research. Scheduled to go online in April 2017, the RIKEN Center for Advanced Intelligence Project will use the new system as a platform to accelerate R&D into AI technology.The largest customer installation of DGX-1 systems to date, the supercomputer will accelerate the application of AI to solve complex challenges in healthcare, manufacturing and public safety.""DGX-1 is like a time-machine for AI researchers,"" said Jen-Hsun Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. ""Enterprises, research centers and universities worldwide are adopting DGX-1 to ride the wave of deep learning - the technology breakthrough at the center of the AI revolution.""According to the NVIDIA blog post on this news…""Conventional HPC (High-Performance Computing) architectures are proving too costly and inefficient for meeting the needs of AI researchers. So companies like Fujitsu and customers like RIKEN are looking for GPU-based solutions that reduce cost and power consumption while increasing performance. Each DGX-1 combines the power of eight NVIDIA Tesla P100 GPUs with an integrated software stack optimized for deep learning frameworks, delivering the performance of 250 conventional x86 servers.""In the video that accompanies this article, I share some simple graphics from NVIDIA that explain how GPU (graphics processing unit) semiconductors work.In the video, I also explain the IBM-NVDA connection as the two have been working together for several years on building HPC architectures and in November announced collaboration on a new deep learning tool ""to help train computers to think and learn in more human-like ways at a faster pace.""Einstein Taps Watson's BrainThe second story revolving around IBM, involvedSalesforce (CRM), who was the talk of the town this week.First, Jim Cramer was talking early in the day on March 6 during CRM's presentation at the Raymond James Institutional Investors Conference and he had a directive forAlphabet (GOOGL):Better buy CRM since nothing else is comparably affordable in embedded enterprise SaaS!Here was the story from StreetInsider.com, with arecap of their own similar call 5 weeks ago...Salesforce.com shares are now trading in positive territory following a mention by Jim Cramer earlier saying that Alphabet needs to by Salesforce.com. This follows a Street Insider post back in January where we wrote ""It would appear reasonably obvious that Alphabet would over pay forFacebook (FB), struggle to buyoutAmazon (AMZN), leaving the rumor-popular Salesforce as the next candidate. Alphabet did not buyback any stock in 2016, likely shoring up capital for a Salesforce purchase. Given that Microsoft, a leading rumored contender for Salesforce, bought LinkedIn, it appears that Alphabet is on the prowl for Salesforce.""Now today, on CNBC during a segment on Unusual Option Activity, at the 1:40 mark Jim Cramer goes on about what Google needs (emphasis ours): ""I think Alphabet, Google, needs very much to get away from a model that is advertising based. People feel they are trapped in it. That's why they're doing Waymo, autonomous cars, which is going very very well. It's why they're doing data-center work, the $400 million thatSNAP (SNAP)is paying them. But if you want to own the enterprise, OK you want to own it, you just BUY SALESFORCE. You take $80 billion and you buy it. Does Marc Benioff want to sell with the beautiful new tower coming and loving the independence of it? They have a close relationship. I think it's up to Benioff if he wants to sell but I do think that Alphabet NEEDS BENIOFF! NEEDS SALESFORCE to get a higher price to earnings multiple.""Then, after the close, Ginni and Marc got together (from the press release)...IBM and Salesforce today announced a global strategic partnership to deliver joint solutions designed to leverage artificial intelligence and enable companies to make smarter decisions, faster than ever before. With the partnership, IBM Watson, the leading AI platform for business, and Salesforce Einstein, AI that powers the world's #1 CRM, will seamlessly connect to enable an entirely new level of intelligent customer engagement across sales, service, marketing, commerce and more. IBM is also strategically investing in its Global Business Services capabilities for Salesforce with a new practice to help clients rapidly deploy the combined IBM Watson and Salesforce Einstein capabilities.The partnership will bring new insights from Watson directly into the Salesforce Intelligent Customer Success Platform, combining deep customer insights from Salesforce Einstein with Watson's structured and unstructured data across many sources and industries including weather, healthcare, financial services and retail. Together, Watson and Einstein will ingest, reason over and derive recommendations to accelerate decision making and drive greater customer success.Comments on the News: ""Within a few years, every major decision-personal or business-will be made with the help of AI and cognitive technologies,"" said Ginni Rometty, chairman, president and chief executive officer, IBM. ""This year we expect Watson will touch one billion people-through everything from oncology and retail to tax preparation and cars. Now, with today's announcement, the power of Watson will serve the millions of Salesforce and Einstein customers and developers to provide an unprecedented understanding of customers.""""The combination of Einstein and Watson will make businesses smarter and our customers more successful,"" said Marc Benioff, chairman and CEO, Salesforce. ""I'm thrilled to form an alliance with IBM-no company's core values are as close to Salesforce's as IBM's. It's the best of both worlds.""This is a huge move by both companies!In the after-hours session on March 6, CRM shares hit a new 52-week high above $85. We have yet to see bullish investors able push it back there since, even as Wall Street investment banks raise their price targets, with Morgan Stanley now at $107, Wedbush at $102, and Cowen and Stifel at $100.But the story is clear: GOOGL is now farther away from doing anything with CRM.And IBM is certainly closer, though that is probably a distant reality this year.In any case, the investment case for CRM was sound last week and just got a lot sweeter this week.And the case for owing NVDA shares below in the $90's is ever sound.To learn more about the ""massively parallel architecture"" that runs NVIDIA processors and IBM supercomputers, check out my video attached to this article.

1 Top Small-Cap Stock to Buy Now;3/9/2017;"Small-cap stocks can deliver explosive gains -- or sizable   losses. Choose well, and these high-risk yet potentially   high-reward stocks can deliver multibagger returns and   turbocharge your portfolio's overall performance. But choose   poorly, and a small-cap stock can produce painful losses, up to   and including a complete loss of capital should the business be   forced into bankruptcy.That's why it's so important to invest in only the best of   these businesses -- those poised to benefit from undeniable   long-term trends and enjoy the largest growth opportunities. Read   on to learn about one such business that meets these challenging   criteria -- and that is one of the small-cap stocks best   positioned to reward investors in the years ahead.Image source: Mindbody.makeArticleAd();Mindbody(NASDAQ: MB) provides cloud-based software solutions to the   health and wellness industry: Think spas, yoga studios, and   fitness classes. It's a massive market that's gone largely   underserved -- and Mindbody is working to address that need.Mindbody's all-in-one solution helps its clients manage nearly   every aspect of their businesses. Need to post an online class   schedule and allow your clients to book appointments through   their smartphones? Mindbody has you covered. Want an easy way to   manage your employees' schedules? No problem. How about   processing payments? Mindbody can help you with that, too.With plans starting at just $75 per month, Mindbody's   offerings are affordable even for start-ups with the most limited   financial resources. And an increasing number of larger   businesses are utilizing Mindbody's more extensive -- and   higher-priced -- packages. In this way, Mindbody is able to scale   its business along with the success of its customers.More than 60,000 businesses have turned to Mindbody's platform   for these solutions. That's up from less than 34,000 subscribers   in the first quarter of 2014. During this time, Mindbody's   revenue has nearly doubled from $70 million in 2014 to $139   million last year.Still, Mindbody isnot yet profitable, which is likely why its stock is currently trading for around   $27; properly valuing early-stage growth companies can be   difficult. But at that price, Mindbody's current $1.1 billion   market cap drastically understates its market potential. The   60,000 businesses Mindbody currently serves are just a tiny   fraction -- about 1.5% -- of the 4.2 million wellness businesses   that the company says exists around the world. And its $139   million in revenue is just a smidgeon of the $9.5billionthat Mindbody estimates as the current size of its addressable   market -- a market that itself is growing, as more people come to   understand the benefits of fitness and overall healthier living.   That's a massive untapped opportunity that could offer Mindbody   years -- and potentially even decades -- of strong growth.Mindbody's powerful network effects should allow it to capture   the lion's share of this immense market. Each new user expands   the base of potential customers for Mindbody's business clients,   and each business that joins Mindbody's platform increases the   number of wellness offerings that users can choose among. It's a   virtuous cycle that should continue to grow stronger as Mindbody   expands its user and subscriber counts in the coming years.To further strengthen its ecosystem, Mindbodyreached a dealwithUnder Armour(NYSE: UA) (NYSE: UAA) that lets the more than 180 million users   of Under Armour's MyFitnessPal app sign up for classes offered by   Mindbody's subscribers. Mindbody also has apartnership withAlphabet's Google(NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) allowing people in several major   cities to book classes listed on Mindbody directly through Google   Search and Maps. These two titans choosing to partner with   Mindbody is a major vote of confidence for its platform, and I   wouldn't be surprised if a company like Under Armour makes a bid   for Mindbody at some point in the future.All told, Mindbody is a leader in a huge and expanding   industry with the ability to grow its market share exponentially   in the years ahead. And at current prices, Mindbody offers   long-term investors a chance atmultibagger-type returnsin the coming decade. That makes this currently small-cap stock a   great buy today.10 stocks we like better than MindbodyWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Alphabet (GOOGL) Continues its Push into AI, Acquires Kaggle;3/9/2017;"Alphabet Inc.'sGOOGLGoogle announced the acquisition of Kaggle, an operator of data science and machine learning competition platform, at the Google Cloud Next conference in San Francisco.Founded in 2010, Kaggle's platform enables data scientists to conduct machine learning contests, host data sets and write and share codes. Over the years, Kaggle has become the world's largest data science community, leveraging on its early mover advantage and focusing on a niche market.Earlier this month, Google and Kaggle hosted a $100,000 machine learning competition around classifying YouTube videos.In recent times, Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning has helped Google in launching innovative products and services for multiple industries. Machine learning is also helping the company to overcome bigger challenges such as improving energy efficiency of data centers.We believe that continuous focus on innovation is likely to drive the Alphabet's stock price going ahead. The shares have appreciated 16.7% in the last one year compared with the ZacksInternet-Servicesindustry'sgain of 14.1%.Google Gearing Up Against Microsoft and AmazonWith more than 0.8 million data scientists on the platform, Kaggle opens up an opportunity for Google to broaden its reach within the data science community and be on an equal footing with Amazon'sAMZNAWS and Microsoft'sMSFTAzure that also offer data science services.As Alphabet generates significant cash from operations and also holds a huge cash balance, management has the flexibility to pursue growth in any area that exhibits true potential. It has the scale and resources to match up to its competitors.Buying Kaggle could also boost Google's recruiting efforts, giving it access to a large pool of scientists.Alphabet Inc. PE Ratio (TTM)Alphabet Inc. PE Ratio (TTM)|Alphabet Inc. QuoteKaggle Eyes Infrastructure, Scalability and Improved   ServicesAccording to Kaggle co-founder and chief executive Anthony Goldbloom, the acquisition will help Kaggle better serve its community with more powerful infrastructure, scalable training and deployment services and the capacity to store and query large data sets.The Kaggle team will join Google Cloud but operate as a distinct brand.To ConcludeGoogle's innovations outside the core search business include healthcare (partnership with Johnson & Johnson for the development of surgical robots), self-driving cars (partnership with Ford), cloud computing and drones, all being driven significantly by machine learning. We believe that the company has the financial muscle to overcome any short-term adverse conditions to continue pursuing these initiatives.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, Alphabet has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Is Betting BIG on Google Cloud in 2017;3/9/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsCloud services are a big business that is only getting bigger. When you think of the cloud, the one company that tends to immediately come to mind isAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) - if for no other reason than when its AWS cloud servers go down, half the internet seems to go with them. ButAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL) is betting big on the cloud too, and at its Next 2017 event, the company had some big announcements.makeArticleAd();Source: GoogleGoogle cloud is celebrating some much-needed wins, including new partners, a significant steal for G Suite and recognition for topping cloud providers in 2016 for reliability.Google Cloud Takes Aim at AWS, AzureThe public cloud is currently dominated by Amazon's AWS, withover 30% of the market- triple the footprint of second-placeMicrosoft Corporation's(NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure. Google cloud is in fourth place, trailingInternational Business Machines Corp.(NYSE:IBM).The cloud is a huge market already and it's expected to get far larger, quickly. Forrester recently pegged the expected value of the public cloud - services like AWS, Azure and Google Cloud - toreach $236 billion by 2020.9 Stocks to Buy That Are Growing Faster Than AmazonAnd Google wants a bigger piece of that pie.At its Next 2017 conference keynote, the company made the case for choosing Google cloud over AWS or Azure. While noting that it has invested $30 billion in its cloud services, the company rattled off an impressive list of companies that haverecently made the move to Google cloud.eBay Inc.(NASDAQ:EBAY) andColgate-Palmolive Company(NYSE:CL) represent the large corporate side of Google cloud's capabilities, while popular apps likePokemon GoandSnap Inc.'s(NYSE:SNAP) Snapchat show off its suitability for hosting consumer apps.Google cloud's head Diane Greene, took the opportunity to fire a shot at Amazon's AWS and the bad PR it's received for large-scale outages. Chances are, you were affected by anAWS issue at the end of Februarythat slowed or took down thousands of websites, apps and services for hours.Greene noted that Google cloud has been recognized for topping all cloud service providers in availability for 2016. She puts that availability level at 99.999% reliability, which is very impressive.It certainly makes a case for switching from AWS.Big Wins for Google Cloud, and G SuiteSeveral big wins for Google cloud were also touted at Next 2017.SAP SE (ADR)(NYSE:SAP) is the world leader in enterprise resource planning software, counting over 345,000 companies as customers. Many large corporations rely on SAP software and it's big enough to be hosting its own cloud services. However, it has signed on for its SAP HANA database to be hosted on Google cloud, instead of at its own data centers.AsTechCrunchnotes,Microsoft and Amazon already had deals signed with SAP. Beating AWS and Azure to host HANA has an even greater significance given that the competition already had an established relationship with SAP.Drop Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock. Here's Why.Also announced at Next 2017 was a big win for G Suite, Google's cloud-hosted productivity apps.Verizon Communications Inc.(NYSE:VZ) announced it has dropped Microsoft Office for 150,000 employees, moving them instead to Google's G Suite.Look for Google to continue aggressively pushing Google cloud services in 2017. The company has been spending big on ramping up its infrastructure, its ""Other"" revenue (which includes cloud revenue) wasup 62% in the last quarterand the majority of its 2,100 hires in Q4 went to cloud operations.As Google cloud's Diane Greene said onstage, ""I think 2017 will be a good year, too.""As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceApple Inc.

3 Value Stock Naked Puts to Make a Quick $1,000;3/9/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsI'm mostly a value stock investor. Value stocks offer greater returns over the long haul than growth stocks, and there is a greater margin of error should you choose poorly. One of the great things about value stocks and naked puts is that the latter allows you to potentially scale into a value stock position even if you aren't certain the stock has yet hit its bottom. If it has, naked puts are still of use.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockNaked puts that generate income like this are a cornerstone strategy of my forthcoming stock advisory newsletter,The Liberty Portfolio.By selling naked puts on a value stock, should the stock get put to you, you get it at an even better value than just buying shares outright. If you also nibble a little at the value stock, you are covered two ways in terms of getting into the stock.7 Cheap Dividend Stocks to Buy NowIf you aren't sure, naked puts allow you to hedge by collecting some premium income.Naked Puts on Value Stocks: Teva (TEVA)Source:Open Grid Scheduler (Modified)Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited Ltd (ADR)(NYSE:TEVA) is just such a potential play for naked puts and value stocks. TEVA is the largest generics company in the world, but it also develops and markets its own biologics, as well as biosimilars.The company has been hit with a wave of bad PR lately amid being sued in a price fixing case. What's more, Teva's also seen one of its top drugs go off-patent, is being investigated for bribery in Russia and its CEO has stepped down. But with shares at their lowest point in ten years, I think the selling is overdone.TEVA closed Wednesday at $32.80. My suggestion is to sell the 19 May $32.50 naked puts for $1.75. Sell three of them to collect $525. That's an incredible return of 5.3%, which you never see for a 67-day holding period, which also equates to about a 29% annualized return.Naked Puts on Value Stocks: BP (BP)Source:Mike Mozart via FlickrBP plc (ADR)(NYSE:BP) is another company that has an even worse, and ongoing, PR problem. Deepwater Horizon remains on in the zeitgeist, thanks also to the recent movie. While BP has been slammed with more than $62 billion in payments from this disaster, it's actual core operating business is doing better.Upstream production is now profitable after quite some time of losing money. It's making money now from the partnership withRosneft(OTCMKTS:OJSCY). But more to the point, it's a value play. BP's EV-Ebitda ratio sits at 8.6 right now. By comparison,Exxon Mobil Corporation(NYSE:XOM) is at 16.1,Chevron Corporation(NYSE:CVX) is at 18.5,Royal Dutch Shell plc(NYSE:RDS.A) is at 10.7 andConocoPhillips(NYSE:COP) is at 16.5.8 Energy Stocks in Peril as Crude Oil Breaks DownBP closed Wednesday at $33.35. You might consider selling the 19 May $33 naked puts for $1.20. If you sell three of them for $360, you have a total of $885 collected so far. You also have a 1% buffer before having the stock put to you.Naked Puts on Value Stocks: Alphabet (GOOGL)Source: ShutterstockFinally, it may come as a surprise but I considerAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) to be a value stock. Well, actually I consider it a GARP stock - growth at a reasonable price.To me, a GARP stock is a growth stock that trades at a value price. That's because, when you back out its net cash position, it trades at a very reasonable multiple compared to its growth rate. Add in a great free cash flow situation and a big brand name, and you have a great stock.As it is, GOOGL trades at $858.27. There are some very aggressive naked puts you can do here that may earn you a cool grand on one trade alone. But since we are just rounding out $1,000 worth of naked puts, and we only need $115, just sell the 19 May $705 naked puts for $130. If you get GOOGL put to you at that price, you'll be thrilled!Lawrence Meyers is the CEO of PDL Capital, and manager of the forthcomingLiberty Portfolio stock newsletter. As of this writing, has no position in any stock mentioned. He has 22 years' experience in the stock market, and has written more than 1,600 articles on investing.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog includeAlphabet(NASDAQ:GOOGL-Free Report),Amazon(NASDAQ:AMZN-Free Report) ,Netflix(NASDAQ:NFLX-Free Report),AT&T(NYSE:T-Free Report) andDISH Networks(NASDAQ:DISH-Free Report).Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations.Get #1Stock of the Day pick for free.Here are highlights from Wednesday's Analyst   Blog:Investors Still Discount Google Post-YouTube TV     AnnouncementAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL-Free Report) shares jumped up a point after the announcement of its live TV streaming service, but the movement was more or less in line with the market. The shares lost most of the gains thereafter and remained below the S&P 500, as they have been since the election.It's widely believed that Google won't have as strong a standing with this government as it had with the previous one, but not for lack of trying. Company executives have been visiting the White House, but Google's very public stand against many of President Trump's sentiments are expected to work against it.Google's results had been stellar in 2016. After the customary dip in the first quarter, both revenue and earnings rose consistently through the year, pulling share prices along... that is, until the election.Revenue strength has come from both the search business as well as new areas including hardware, Play and cloud. Management said on the last call that there was ""tremendous potential"" in these areas and enthused over ""continued development of non-advertising revenue streams for YouTube.""In that they were probably referring at least in part to YouTube TV, an expansion of the Google service that is better known for letting you watch thousands of hours of video from a seemingly endless stock.DetailsThe company has joined with all four major broadcast networks (CBS, ABC, NBC and Fox), so a family of six can stream live content from 40+ channels at $35 a month. The company will maintain separate accounts for each member although only three can stream at a time.The price indicates that YouTube is probably still in negotiations to add more channels in the few months until it launches in important U.S. cities like New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and Philadelphia. The company plans to expand gradually to other U.S. cities. International expansion plans weren't mentioned.Also, as far as channels are concerned, there are some important exclusions: HBO, CNN, PBS, the Cartoon Network, TNT, or Viacom channels such as Comedy Central, MTV and VH1, Nickelodeon, Scripps' Food Network and Home and Garden TV.But Google does offer you all the goodness of YouTube (and that includes YouTube Red for original content, if you are a subscriber). The YouTube TV app for Android/iOS also allows you to stream whatever you're viewing to Chromecast, so you can make use of the larger TV screen (built-in Chromecast TVs will also do the job). At some future date (the demo failed during this announcement), Google hopes that you will be able to tell your devices via Google Home or Cast to turn on what you want to see.The best part? It gives you a real DVR experience by allowing you to store an unlimited number of your recordings for up to nine months, quite unheard-of amongst its competitors like DirecTV Now, PlayStation Vue and Sling TV. The Vue allows you to save shows from some channels for up to 28 days while Sling TV is still testing a service that will allow you to save up to 100 hours of recordings.Is It a Good Deal?That depends.If you're into traditional TV, you would be spending $80-100 on it, while making do with long-term contracts. YouTube TV is a good deal that way because it comes for just $35, no strings attached while also allowing you mobility. Then again, if you like all the content that's still exclusive to PayTV, you may want to stick with your current subscription.If you're more of a netizen, you're already familiar with the ""skinny bundle"" concept, wherein the most-watched/popular channels are served at a lower price. Either way, there's plenty of choice.So YouTube, which still focuses on user experience more than profits and has the resources to go for the best content, may be more capable of delivering the superior experience.What's In It for Google/YouTube?YouTube has for long been the go-to destination for online video consumption although Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN-Free Report) , Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX-Free Report) and others also have their own thing. Now that it is getting into live TV streaming, it's also pitted against traditional operators like AT&T (NYSE:T-Free Report) with its DirecTV Now, DISH Networks (NASDAQ:DISH-Free Report) with its Sling TV and CBS with its All Access that are also turning to the Internet to protect their revenues. The market is very crowded, so prices are under pressure.But if data from GfK is to be relied upon, the portion of American homes subscribing to a Pay TV service has shrunk to 75% with a much smaller 6% using Apple TV-like devices to stream shows to a TV. Moreover, the number of TVs per home is declining while the number of homes without a TV is on the rise (U.S Energy Information Administration survey). According to Morningstar, Pay TV executives estimate that 10 million homes subscribe to broadband only and not TV.eMarketer estimates that YouTube's 180 million viewers generated $3 billion last year and Google recently announced that it surpassed a billion hours of daily viewership. TV ads reportedly generate $70 billion in revenues annually, so there's a fair chance that as consumer preference continues shifting to online channels, YouTube TV will allow Google to take its share of those dollars.About Zacks Equity ResearchZacks Equity Research provides the best of quantitative and qualitative analysis to help investors know what stocks to buy and which to sell for the long-term.Continuous coverage is provided for a universe of 1,150 publicly traded stocks.

10 Companies Set to Dominate the Next Decade;3/9/2017;"Image source: Getty Images.Any investor would love to get their hands on a crystal ball   and take a quick peek at what's going to happen over the next   decade. The problem is, those crystal balls are hard to come by,   so we all have to settle for looking at what companies are doing   right now -- and attempt to anticipate how that will help or hurt   them in the future.makeArticleAd();The good news is that therearecompanies positioning themselves for growth over the next decade,   and setting themselves up to dominate in their respective   markets. Take a look:Image source: Amazon.1. AmazonAmazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) has its hands in so many business it's hard to   keep up. For some companies, that degree of diversification can   proof more trouble than it's worth, but Amazon's has shown it can   sell everything from tablets to its Echo speaker, while   simultaneously creating award-winning television shows and   managing a massive online consumer goods marketplace, andstillhave business bandwidth to power some of the biggest websites   through its Amazon Web Services unit.The company's ability to diversify its businesses -- while   still tying many of them to its Prime service -- has given Amazon   a lead over its competitors that won't fade any time soon.Image source: Google.2. AlphabetWith a $581 billion market cap, Google parentAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) is a juggernaut of the technology   industry, yet it still innovates like a much smaller, scrappier   company. Alphabet may still earn most of its revenue -- 99% --   from Google, but that hasn't stopped it from making big bets on   thedriverless car marketand even moonshots like curing cancer.Among the more than 20 companies under the Alphabet umbrella,   there are units trying to secure major positions in the future of   transportation, artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and the   burgeoning Internet of Things. Add to that the company's mobile   dominance with its Android platform, and its new devices like the   Pixel Phone and Google Home and its crystal clear that Alphabet   will still be one of the most dominant tech giants a decade from   now.Image source: Facebook.3. FacebookEvery day, the world feels like it gets a little bit smaller   and slightly more connected, andFacebook(NASDAQ: FB) deserves at least partial credit for that. With more   than 1.86 billion users on the company's main platform, and more   growth coming in huge markets like India, Facebook shows no sign   of slowing down in the social media space.The company plans to have 5 billion users by 2030. Take a   minute and remember that we have 7 billion people on the planet   right now. That's a hefty goal, but if any company can do it it's   Facebook. Aside from its main Facebook platform, the company is   investing billions in connecting people around the world through   its WhatsApp, Instagram, Messenger, and is investing heavily in   building what CEO Mark Zuckerberg calls ""the next computing   platform"" -- virtual reality.Image source: Lockheed Martin.4. Lockheed MartinLockheed Martin(NYSE: LMT) has gotten some flak for the high price of its F-35   Lightning stealth fighter jet, as President Trump has so kindly   pointed out onTwitter. But despite the criticisms, the F-35 is poised to help Lockheed   Martin dominate the aerospace industry over the next decade.Consider that the F-35 is expected to be in service until 2070   and could bring in more than $1 trillion in revenue for the   company over that time span. Sure, Lockheed may further trim the   cost of the planes -- as it did recently, when it announced its   long-term efforts to reduce costs had cut the price on its next   batch of 90 planes by $700 million -- but with more than 50   years of revenues expect to come from this jet family, there's   little reason to be skeptical of Lockheed's dominance.Image source: Netflix.5. NetflixNot so long ago, the idea ofNetflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) being capable of creating original, award-winning   programming would have seemed absurd. But over the past few   years, the company has amassed a vast trove of original content   that has not only won over critics but also helped the company   win new customers. In fact, 57% of the streaming service's U.S.   subscribers say they signed up for because of its original   content.Netflix now boasts about 93.8 million subscribers in 190   countries, and it's still growing. The company faces rising   competition from Amazon's Prime video service, but says it plans   on investing $6 billion in original content this year, which   should help it fend off rivals. A decade from now, Netflix will   have the advantage of that much more original content production   under its belt, and more streaming experience than any of its   competitors.Image source: Disney.6. DisneyWalt Disney(NYSE: DIS) expanded its empire back in 2009 when it purchased   Marvel Studios for $4 billion, and followed that up with another   $4 billion purchase -- of Lucasfilm -- in 2012. Those two   entertainment land-grabs alone will provide huge catalysts for   the company over the next decade, as it reaps the benefits from   theStar Warsfranchise, Marvel movies, merchandise, licensing ... you get the   picture.Add to all of that the company's long list of theme parks,   cruise ships, resorts, and its Pixar Studios, and it's easy to   foresee Disney holding a powerful position the entertainment   business for years to come. The company will have to adapt to a   shifting pay-TV landscape, and adjust to how those changes will   impact the company's all-important ESPN networks. But investors   would be wise to remember that the company already has many   decades worth of strategy-shifting experience.Image source: GE.7. General ElectricGeneral Electric(NYSE: GE) has weathered more changes than most companies over   its 100-plus year history, and the conglomerate  recently   reinvented itself once again to benefit from the rapidly evolving   industrial and technological landscape.Consider that CEO Jeff Immelt said back in 2015 that his   company is ""on track to become a top 10 software company.""    Software may seem like a far cry from the engine turbines   and other industrial equipment GE is known for, but it's   anticipating the rise of the Industrial Internet of Things   (IIoT), in which equipment is connected to the Internet, collects   data, and then analyzes it, helping make companies and systems   more efficient. GE is already well on its way in this market, and   with the IIoT estimated to add $14.2 trillion to the global   economy by 2030, there's plenty of room for growth.Image source: Tesla.8. TeslaCompared to other U.S. automakers,Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) is still  in its infancy, but the electric   carmaker is quickly becoming key player in the space. Tesla   is preparing to launch its fourth vehicle, the Model 3, later   this year, and estimates that it will produce 500,000 cars   annually starting in 2018.That's not so impressive when compared to, say,Ford's 2.6 million U.S. vehicle sales last year. But Tesla is betting   that the future of passenger cars is electric, and it's building   out a vast network of supercharger stations across the U.S and   Europe to fuel them, has already built the   battery-making Gigafactory to help drive down vehicle costs,   and is a leader in the driverless car space. If electric and   self-driving vehicles are the future, then the next decade could   certainly be dominated by Tesla.Image source: Oracle.9. OracleOracle(NYSE: ORCL) is slowly shifting from a hardware-dominated sales   model to one that generates more recurring revenue from software   and services. Its cloud computing revenue was up 64% year over   year in its most recent quarter, and topped $1 billion for   the first time. Oracle is now the leading cloud computing   provider for companies that have 1,000 or more employees, and has   made major investments in the space with acquisitions such as   cloud provider NetSuite, which it picked up for a cool $9.3   billion.The shift away from hardware to software and services may have   been slow in coming for Oracle, but it's making up for lost time,   and betting that its current cloud investments will pay off over   the long term. Given its current position in the tech world, and   its rising power in cloud computing, you can bet Oracle will   maintain its position for years to come.Image source: Nike.10.

Why Alphabet and Microsoft Should Start Disclosing Cloud Revenue;3/8/2017;"Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) is currently hosting its Google   Cloud Next '17 developer conference, which kicked off earlier   today in San Francisco and runs through March 10. Speaking at the   event, Google CEO Sundar Pichai made it clear that he sees Google   Cloud as an incredibly important part of the search giant's   future, and not just one of the company's many side bets. ""To me,   Google Cloud is a natural extension of our mission to make the   world's information accessible and usable,"" Pichai said.The distinction is that while search helps regular users   access information, cloud computing infrastructure and the   related value-added services like analytics help the enterprise   organize and access their information. The cloud infrastructure   market is booming, growing 49% last year to $38.1 billion,   according to market researcher Canalys. It's expected to jump   another 46% this year to $55.8 billion. As the market grows, so,   too, does the impact on the financials of the major players:   Google Cloud,Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Azure, andAmazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) AWS.Google data center in Council Bluffs, Iowa. Image source:     Google.makeArticleAd();As such, the former two should start disclosing exactly how   much cloud revenue they're bringing in.Follow Amazon's leadI never thought I'd see the day when Amazon was leading the   way in investor transparency, given the e-commerce giant's   long-standing refusal to share various operating metrics that are   pertinent to investors. Yet, when it comes to AWS and cloud   revenue, Amazon is doing just that; Amazon started sharing AWS   financials in 2015. AWS revenue was $12.2 billion last year,   translating into $3.1 billion in operating income.Microsoft only discloses growth rates for Azure (up 93% last   quarter), but lacking a base number, that data point is less   meaningful. We do know that total revenue in Microsoft's   intelligent cloud segment, which includes Azure among other   offerings, was $6.9 billion last quarter, resulting in $2.4   billion in operating income. Lacking an official figure, JPMorgan   analysts estimate Azure revenue for all of 2016 was $2.7 billion,   which would make AWS nearly five times bigger.Google includes Google Cloud revenue within its Google other   revenues segment, which generated a hair over $10 billion in   sales in 2016. That also includes revenue from Google Play as   well as the company's growing hardware portfolio. One   particularly prominent Google Cloud customer that just went   public likely spent between $400 million to $450 million last   year, and is committed to $400 million per year for thenext five years, so there's that.Sharing is caringYou could reasonably argue that AWS is far more important to   Amazon than its peers' respective cloud businesses, though,   specifically since AWS is by far the market leaderandit's such a major contributor to profitability due to razor-thin   margins in the core e-commerce business. In contrast, Google and   Microsoft enjoy much higher gross margin, as they each specialize   in software and services.Still, the cloud infrastructure market is only going to become   increasingly important in the years ahead, and investors will   want to see the results from the three largest players to assess   each company's competitiveness. Google and Microsoft should start   sharing more, especially if it's as important as Pichai says it   is.10 stocks we like better than AlphabetWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

YouTube TV's Biggest Advantage;3/8/2017;"YouTube recently announced its plans to offer a live   television streaming service to compete with the likes of DirecTV   Now, PlayStation Vue, Sling TV, and more traditional pay-TV   operators. YouTube TV will include 40 live channels and will be   initially available in select markets.While YouTube TV is missing quite a few channels compared with   competing services, it has the potential to attract a lot of   attention from media companies in the future thanks to one huge   advantage over the competitors: Google, theAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) subsidiary and owner of YouTube,   is one of the best digital video advertisers in the world.Image source: YouTubemakeArticleAd();Disney already sees the value in digital streamingDisney(NYSE: DIS) CEO Bob Iger is actively trying to get his networks   into digital skinny bundles. Indeed, Disney's networks, including   ESPN, are available in the lowest-priced tiers of all of the   aforementioned streaming services.Importantly, Disney is not sacrificing any of its affiliate   fees to get its channels into those tiers. ""The per-channel fees,   which we are not getting too specific about, are commensurate   with what the fees are on the existing services,"" Iger said about   its deal with DirecTV Now.But there's an added benefit to going digital. ""Some of the   technology platforms will offer dynamic ad insertion. We think   that that has got some real potential for the company,"" Iger told   investors on the company's third-quarter earnings call last   year.Dynamic ad insertion allows media companies to serve targeted   ads to viewers instead of using the one-size-fits-all system of   traditional live broadcasts. YouTube TV may give media companies   the opportunity to tap into Google's targeting data. On top of   that, YouTube already has millions of advertisers on its   platform, which it could tap for more premium YouTube TV ads.Media companies might give YouTube TV a bigger break on   affiliate fees if it can produce meaningfully higher ad revenue   per viewer than its competitors.YouTube will have a chance to prove itself, tooMedia companies will handle the majority of their ad buying at   the launch of YouTube TV, but YouTube will have access to about   two minutes of ads for every hour of viewing. That's the ad   inventory that every cable company receives. If YouTube can use   its decade of advertising experience and produce outsize results,   it could increase interest from media companies for its   services.That bit of advertising is about the only thing that will make   YouTube TV profitable, as analysts estimate its affiliate fees   total about $29 before accounting for various regional sports   networks, which could add $4 to $5.Suffice it to say YouTube TV has a lot running on that small   slice of advertising inventory.Taking on a $71 billion marketThe market Google is going after with YouTube TV isn't so much   the pay-TV market as it is the television advertising market.   Google tried to break into the market before by partnering with   media companies about a decade ago. Now, it's using YouTube TV as   a platform to gain access to that inventory, which generated   about $71 billion in the U.S. last year.Getting YouTube TV off the ground and showing media companies   what it's capable of with advertising is the first step. The more   successful it is with its own ad inventory, the more likely it is   to win the business of more media companies. In turn, more   customers will sign up as the value improves and YouTube is able   to bring on more networks.If YouTube TV is successful, it will be because its superior   advertising makes it a win-win-win -- the media companies, the   consumers, and YouTube.10 stocks we like better than Alphabet (C   shares)When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Will Snap Inc (SNAP) Succeed or Fall Out of Investors' Favor?;3/8/2017;"Snap Inc.SNAP,  the parent company of social network, Snapchat, was off to a brilliant start on its debut. The company's IPO was multiple times oversubscribed and shares soared 44% on the first day of trading. However, shares fell nearly 10% yesterday amid reports that the company has come under fire from several institutional investorsSnap Lands into Trouble with Institutional   InvestorsInvestors aren't happy with the company's offering of 200 million Class A shares that carry no voting rights. Per a Business Insider report, they have ""approached"" stock index providers such as S&P Dow Jones Indices and MSCI Inc to prevent Snap and other such companies that offer shares without voting rights from getting incorporated into these benchmark indexes. The meeting is scheduled sometime this week.Investors argue that the absence of voting rights completely bars a shareholder from speaking on issues like a company's growth plans or compensation shelled out to executives. Business Insider also adds that if such a company is listed on any of the indices, ""then managers of stock index portfolios will have to buy its shares and other investors, whose performance is tracked against such indexes, would likely follow suit.""The absence of voting rights implies that the company does not intend to dilute its decision making power. Snap will have a three-tier share structure and founders Evan Spigel and Bobby Murphy will have maximum voting rights through the ownership of Class C shares, which carry 10 votes per share. The Class B shares carry one vote per share. Such form of corporate governance might prove detrimental for investors, especially when there is uncertainty about its future.What's Concerning Investors?Snap Inc has been shunned by many Wall Street analysts for various reasons. Citing instances of Twitter Inc.TWTR, Groupon Inc and many others, analysts believe that Snap ""will follow a pattern of hot, then cooling, tech IPOs.""Reportedly, most analysts have initiated coverage on Snap with a ""sell"" rating. These analysts argue that Snap has already started seeing its average daily user growth rate slowdown.  Plus, the company is yet to make profits. Though the company's revenues are on the rise, losses are ballooning. Reportedly, in 2016, Snap's revenues of $404.5 million were nearly six times higher than 2015 revenues but net loss for the year increased 38% to $514.6 million.Moreover, since Snapchat has just one source of revenues i.e., advertising, which only began in Oct 2016, it may be a concern for investors. Also, it attracts a particular segment of the demography.Analysts argue that teens are inclined to sudden changes in preferences. Media reports have quoted Snap ""admitting"" that increasing competition from big players like Facebook IncFB, which have better resources, is a big threat as they can easily lure users to their platform.In fact, Facebook outshines Snap in almost all aspects. The company enjoys a first mover advantage in the social media space with over 1.9 billion users from every segment of demography. It has a gargantuan base of over 1 billion DAUs compared with 158 million for Snap. Facebook presents a much larger canvas for advertisers than Snapchat. In fact, Facebook's total addressable market (TAM) has been reported to be 80% bigger than that of Snap.Also, Facebook through its Instagram application has started to emulate Snapchat features, which is a big threat for Snapchat. Analysts observe that Facebook can easily take chances by unveiling features that are similar to other social media services. This is because if these ""inspired"" features do not work, it can easily roll them back like it did previously with Poke, Slingshot and Bolt.After all, platforms like Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger do have their own inherent features that will prevent the loss of users. If these ""inspired"" features become popular like Facebook Live, people will view it as an improvement over the inherent features. This will significantly cut down the risk of migration if Snapchat becomes popular going ahead.An analyst was quoted saying ""Good-enough features plus being the first app to offer them at scale in a market could succeed better than having the best features but showing up late."" Compared to Facebook's worldwide popularity, Snap is mainly popular in the U.S and Canada. Apart from Facebook, Alphabet'sGOOGLYouTube is another formidable opponent for ad dollarsAlso, Snap's valuation is nosebleed. At nearly 60 times its revenues, analysts remain wary as it is too high compared to existing and future growth prospects.Wait, Not All Is Lost!!However, there are some analysts who aren't so negative on the stock. They believe that product innovations might help Snap to sustain the momentum.Thebest partabout the company is that it does not follow the usual advertising model of charging per click, rather it charges advertisers per day. The consistently expanding daily active user base has been attracting more and more consumers.Apart from this, the company's Snapchat Discover feature has enhanced its picture and video library, thereby attracting more and more advertisers. The feature also allows the company to partner with major events like the Oscars and Super Bowl. Discover currently accounts for a majority of the company's advertising revenues.At the Morgan Stanley conference held a couple of months back, CEO Spiegel was quoted by media reports as saying that 50% of its new user base now comprises users over the age of 25. Plus, Snapchat, in order to diversify its revenue base, has started selling Snapchat spectacles worth $130.ConclusionSnap is currently stealing all the limelight. It remains to be seen whether the company can keep the excitement alive by providing a more immersive experience. We can only hope that its success will not be ""ephemeral"" like its messaging features.Want to learn more about Snapchat stock?

Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock Looks Overbought. It Isn’t.;3/8/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFew names in the markets have almost universal appeal.Microsoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of them. Sure,Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) products have more appeal,Alphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG,NASDAQ:GOOGL) is more popular andAmazon.com, Inc(NASDAQ:AMZN) is more engaging, but let's give credit where credit is due. Most of us have grown up with Microsoft programs, and we continue to use them frequently to this day.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockOf course, emotional sentiment only goes so far. To prove its relevance in a changing world, Microsoft must deliver the goods. For most of this decade, the results for Microsoft stock have been fantastic.We're talking five out of seven years in the black, with an average annual profit of nearly 14%. In addition, MSFT stock has enjoyed four consecutive years of double-digit growth.I don't care how many caveats you can mention about the proverbial old dog … that's a trick that's tough to master at any age. Seemingly, the change at the top of the Microsoft war room, from Steve Ballmer to Satya Nadella, is working wonders. Most importantly, the willingness to aggressively push into new territory is encouraging for potential Microsoft shareholders.9 Stocks to Buy That Are Growing Faster Than AmazonInvestorPlace contributor Will Ashworth took this confidence further by declaring that MSFT stock willhit $80 this year. Is this wishful thinking, or is there more to this than mere bravado?Challenges Facing MSFT stockFirst things first - I admire the guts Ashworth displayed. That's putting yourself out there and giving clarity to your point of view. It's something I wish I could see in Washington, but that's a whole different ballgame.With MSFT stock specifically, the bullish argument is an easy one, but so is the cautious approach. Shares have soared despite the wave of competition in the consumer tech sector. InvestorPlace contributor Vince Martin speaks for a lot of people whenhe wrote, ""I continue to be surprised at the strength shown by Microsoft stock. MSFT stock has risen roughly 150% in just four years - despite little movement in profits.""The lack of fundamental growth is even more perplexing when you consider Microsoft's position within the fierce environment. The company is either lagging, or is getting challenged by rising up-and-comers. Martin writes:""For Office 365,Tableau Software Inc(NYSE:DATA) is challenging Excel - and 27% revenue growth in 2016 suggests DATA is taking share from MSFT. Behemoths likeOracle Corporation(NYSE:ORCL) and many others are in the cloud space. Microsoft's Dynamics CRM product is a distant second tosalesforce.com, inc. (NYSE:CRM).""A huge concern for those trading MSFT stock is the market capitalization. I'm not a fan of focusing on any one metric. Still, with its equity valued at half a trillion dollars, you have to take a step back. Is Microsoft stock really worth that much?Click to EnlargeKeep in mind that despite four consecutive years of double-digit growth, the magnitude has also declined. The first strike was 39.5% in 2013, followed by performances of 28.4%, 21.9% and 16.5%.Microsoft Stock Is a Proven WinnerAdmittedly, that's not the direction the trend should go. Nevertheless, I think Ashworth is going to be a happy camper. Like other tech names, Microsoft stock starts off the year fairly slowly. For example, its first quarter returns are a relatively pedestrian 8%.But at year's end, the average return jumps up to 30.7%, nearly four times higher. That also means that those who are concerned about this year's slow start for MSFT stock shouldn't be.The other attribute that is remarkable about Microsoft is its resiliency. Between 2000 and 2011, MSFT stock suffered a negative Q1 performance ten times. But in four of those instances, shares managed to claw back positive returns for the year. That provides a lot of security for those making strongly optimistic calls for Microsoft stock.While investors have reason to look at MSFT cautiously, I think Wall Street is giving Nadella and company a fair shake. They want to see what it can do with its long-term strategy, and the signs are encouraging. A prime example is Microsoft'shigh-profile acquisitionofLinkedIn. By integrating its intellectual capital with Microsoft's vast networks, it can do serious damage in the social media sphere.Snap Inc (SNAP) Stock: Stay Away at All Costs!Overall, $80 for Microsoft stock is very reasonable. Although not dominant, it's competing well in some of the most exciting and high-growth sectors. Both the company and the markets are loving the change in leadership and culture. Finally, Microsoft continues to find ways to do well, even in the most trying of circumstances. The only question is, can I be the first to call $100 in 2018?As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace3 Drug Stocks Hit by Trump's Call for Lower Prices4 Food Stocks at Risk Thanks to Record HeatThe postMicrosoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock Looks Overbought.

But does it make sense for FB stock?makeArticleAd();Source:The Crunchies! via FlickrFresh off its 44% one-day surge last Thursday, SNAP stock closed Tuesday at $21.44, plunging as much as 30% from its high Friday of $29.44. The parent of popular messaging app Snapchat is projected to lose money for the next couple of years. But that was the case a week ago, too.On Monday, Laura Martin, analysts at Needham & Company, rated SNAP stock a ""sell"" and slapping it with low target range of $19. She's one of five analysts will a sell rating.It seems analysts have begun to look beyond the initial hysteria to now realize Snap's slowing user growth puts it closer to the reality ofTwitter Inc(NYSE:TWTR), which is trading more than 40% below its own IPO price from a couple of years ago.Still, Snap's suffering could be Facebook's gain. Snap's platform and its existing user demographic have tons of value to sustain Facebook's ad growth objectives.7 Stocks That Will Hit All-Time Lows in 2017Since its launch, the Snapchat app has consistently focused on introducing new and unique features, making it widely popular among teenagers. The company claims the app had 158 million daily active users per day at the end of 2016 - majority of which are between 18 and 34 years old. These totals mark a 48% year-over-year increase. And the fact that the daily users visit more than 20 times per day (on an average 30 minutes per visit) could be a boon for marketers.Beyond being a revenue driver for Facebook, by acquiring Snap, FB stock would be eliminating a potential threat. This is something it has strategically done with acquisitions of both Instagram and WhatsApp, which have become core to Facebook's growth. In that regard, CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been brilliant.The question, then, at what point (or valuation) does it make sense for Facebook to pounce?As of Tuesday's close, Snap had a market cap of $25 billion, which analyst seems to consider overvalued. And with an average price target of $15.50, which implies a target market cap of around $20 billion, Facebook may want to wait. But does it want to risk losing Snap toMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) or perhaps worse,Alphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL)?Bottom Line for FB StockThe many options still available to Facebook makes FB stock one that should be owned, not traded. Combined with accelerating ad-revenue growth, Facebook's $6 billion stock buyback and its mobile assets, FB stock should reach $160 in the next 12 to 18 months, driven by projected year-over-year EPS growth of almost 30%.As of this writing, Richard Saintvilus did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace7 Telecom Stocks That Are High-Yield Money Traps5 Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy in MarchIs Caterpillar Inc.

Stocks recently featured in the blog includeApple's(NASDAQ:AAPL-Free Report),Pandora(NYSE:P-Free Report),Alphabet Inc.'s(NASDAQ:GOOGL-Free Report), andSony(NYSE:SNE-Free Report).Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations.Get #1Stock of the Day pick for free.Here are highlights from Tuesday's Analyst Blog:Will Spotify Stream into an IPO in 2017?Launched in 2008 by entrepreneurs Daniel Ek and Martin Lorentzon, Stockholm, Sweden-basedSpotifyis one of the most popular streaming services on the market today. With its desktop and mobile app version, the company allows users to search or browse, for free, through its extensive music library. Spotify also offers a ""Premium"" subscription for $9.99 per month that removes advertisements and lets users download music to listen to offline.CompetitionSpotify recently announced that it now has 100 million monthly active users, with 50 million paying for the service. This achievement has cemented its status as the biggest subscription music service by user count, and the leader in the increasingly crowded music streaming industry.Arguably Spotify's biggest market rival is Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL-Free Report) Apple Music. Launched in 2015, Apple Music is a streaming music service based on Beats Music, which has drawn listeners with playlists made by experts, not algorithms. The service is also known for its collaborations with high-profile musicians like Drake and Taylor Swift. It costs $9.99 per month, and users can download music from an extensive digital library, just like Spotify. Apple Music offers listeners a free, three-month initial trial.There's also Tidal, the Scandinavian streaming service that rapper and mogul Jay Z scooped up back in 2015 for $56 million. It has a similar price of $9.99 per month for normal streaming, while also offering a $19.99 per month option that includes high-fidelity sound quality. Like Apple Music, Tidal is known for its partnerships with big music names. Rihanna, Beyoncé, and Kanye West all exclusively debuted their latest albums on Tidal before a wider release.Other top rivals include Rdio, which provides access to online radio stations, with different levels of on-demand access, for $3.99 to $9.99 per month; Pandora (NYSE:P-Free Report), one of the original internet radio companies, goes for $4.99 per month to avoid ads; Rhapsody, the original streaming music subscription service, has been around since 2001, and is available for $9.99 per month; and Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOGL-Free Report) Google Play Music, which offers online music storage and a streaming service for $9.99 per month.ControversiesDespite its popularity, Spotify tends to draw out negative publicity, mainly over debates about its free advertising-supported service. This service allows people who are prepared to sit through occasional ads to listen to songs for free on demand. Music labels-Spotify is in compliance with Sony (NYSE:SNE-Free Report), EMI, Warner Music Group, and Universal, among others-understandably dislike the free service because it dismantles album sales, and pays less in royalties than the subscription does.We all remember Spotify's battle with Taylor Swift. The popstar withdrew her entire catalog from the service because she ""didn't like the way it felt. I think there should be an inherent value placed on art. I didn't see that happening, perception-wise, when I put my music on Spotify,"" shesaid in an interviewwithTime.Other musicians soon followed in her footsteps. Icelandic singer Björk made her latest albumVulnicuraunavailable on Spotify and other streaming services, though her back catalogue remained available. And in 2015, British songstress Adele similarly restricted her Grammy-winning album25from all streaming services-however, you can currently listen to it on Spotify, along with her other albums,19and21-on its release date,tellingTimethat ""I believe music should be an event.""Last year, Spotify was embroiled in issues surrounding its updated Terms and Conditions of Use, where in ablog post, the company's user communications manager Candace Katz explains ""We may ask for customer permission to collect information from new sources, such as address book, location, and sensor data [and photos, voice controls, and contacts] from the mobile device to improve the customer experience and inform product decisions.""This unexpectedly caused an uproar, with many calling Spotify's new privacy policy ""eerie"" and ""creepy"" and pledging to unsubscribe from the service. The backlash was bad enough that CEO Ek wrote another blog post, aptly called ""SORRY"" in order to explain that users don't have to share this information if they don't want to. ""We will ask for your express permission before accessing any of this data - and we will only use it for specific purposes that will allow you to customize your Spotify experience.""An IPO on the Horizon?Over the past few years or so, Spotify has been on the hunt for new funding. The company closed funding rounds in 2012 and 2013, raising $100 million and $250 million, respectively. In 2016, Spotify completed a whopping $526 million round of funding, putting it at a valuation of roughly $8.5 billion, a move that showed investors its desire for expansion and new forms of content-a few months before this funding round, Spotify announced its plan to add videos and podcasts from partners like ESPN, NBC, Comedy Central, and Condé Nast.And about a year ago, the company raised $1 billion in convertible debt on the promise that its new investors will receive a 30% discount on shares when it files for an IPO. Spotify will have to pay 5% annual interest on the debt, however, and 1% more every six months, up to a total of 10%, until it goes public.This decision to raise money through convertible debt was a smart move, as Spotify was able to maintain its high valuation without diluting its existing shareholders. It does suggest the company is seriously thinking about an IPO, since the latest round of funding encourages Spotify to go public sooner rather than later.Or, at least, that's what was originally thought.According toTechCrunch, Spotify is apparently considering delaying its IPO to 2018, with sources saying the company wants to use the time to ""build a better balance sheet and work on shifting its business model to improve its margins."" But in reality, the delay is likely linked to Spotify's inability to finalize new licensing deals with the big record labels like Universal, Sony, and Warner, whom control 80% of recorded music.There's no doubt about Spotify's rapid growth and universal reach, but it remains unprofitable mostly because of the fees paid to these music labels. The company supposedly pays a royalty rate of 55% of its sales, and is fighting to pay less. Nevertheless, its impressive valuation-aTechCrunchsource hopes to target a valuation between $11 billion and $13 billion--and popularity will work in their favor when their public debut comes. Patience is a virtue, fellow investor, so sit back, relax, and wait for Spotify's exciting future.Now That Snapchat is Public, Which Tech Giant Could IPO   Next?You may be curious about the buzz surrounding Snap's IPO, but should you buy up this tech stock?

Apple Inc. (AAPL) iPhone 8: New Name, Late Release?;3/8/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsApple Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AAPL) upcoming flagship smartphone continues to be the subject of intense speculation. With the countdown on to finalizing design and starting production of the new iPhone, two details in particular have seen conflicting theories: the name and the display size.makeArticleAd();Source: AppleA new post from Japan'sMac Otakarasuggests AAPL will go with the iPhone Edition - instead of iPhone 8 or 10th anniversary iPhone - for its flagship model.The website also feels it has nailed the display size, and agrees with a previous report that the new iPhone could arrive significantly later than usual.iPhone 8 = iPhone Edition?What to call the new iPhone is actually a big deal this year. The regular naming sequence will continue with the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus. Those are the phones for everyone. But what do you call the all-new flagship AAPL is expected to release -the $1,000+ smartphonethat celebrates a decade in the business (and hopefully helps to propel sales to stratospheric levels)?The iPhone X, 10th Anniversary iPhone and iPhone 8 have been the front runners. But what would you call the 10th Anniversary iPhonenextyear? And iPhone 8 would mess up Apple's naming scheme for its mainstream models.Apple Inc. (AAPL) Can't Commit to HollywoodMac OtakarathinksAAPL will go with the iPhone Edition. The premium Apple Watch model is the Apple Watch Edition, so the precedent has already been set and it would be consistent. This would also solve the continuity problem associated with naming a new iPhone specifically around the 10th anniversary, without messing up the current iPhone naming scheme. iPhone Edition makes sense.About the New iPhone DisplayOutside of whether it would be curved or not, or OLED or not, there have been conflicting reports about the display's size. Most analysts have been calling for a 5.8-inch display with bezels practically eliminated. That would let AAPL fit a larger display into an iPhone that's smaller than the 5.5-inch iPhone 7 Plus.It's a similar approach to whatSamsung Electronics Co Ltd(OTCMKTS:SSNLF)appears to have taken with the Galaxy S8.However,Mac Otakarahas always maintained - and still insists - that the new iPhone will have a 5-inch display. Which seems weird, given the consumer preference for big screens.Mac Rumorsconnected the dotsand theorizes that the information given to the Japanese website is for theusablespace. The remaining display area would be where AAPL has a row of virtual buttons - a feature that has already been mentioned as replacing the Home button and mimicking the functionality of the new MacBook Pro Touch Bar.Take a 5.8-inch display, reserve the bottom of that display for the virtual buttons, and you end up with what is effectively a 5-inch display in terms of what the owner can make use of.The math is starting to add up.iPhone Edition Could Be DelayedFinally,Mac Otakaraagrees with the growing number of analysts who are predicting the iPhone 8 - or iPhone Edition - is going to face a delayed release.A few days ago,9to5 Macreported the iPhone 7s series would go into production in July, as expected. But there are rumors that the TouchID sensor that AAPL is integrating into the new iPhone Edition's display is proving challenging. The added manufacturing complexity may push mass production for the new flagship model to September. That would mean severe supply constraints, including the possibility that theiPhone Edition would not begin shipping until a month after the iPhone 7s, with only early pre-orders being delivered in 2017.If the production issues turn out to be true, the results could be problematic … but not necessarily.Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Is Still ""The One""On the downside, Apple would face the possibility that potential iPhone 7s buyers hold off until they can physically compare it against the iPhone Edition, delaying that wave of upgrades. Potential iPhone Edition buyers could also shrug and order the iPhone 7s instead, not wishing to wait a few months for their new smartphone. And without the 1-2 punch of the 7s and iPhone Edition together, AAPL could miss out on the spectacularly record-smashing launch sales weekend it is gunning for to celebrate that 10th anniversary.On the upside, the annual crest of sales that accompany every new iPhone release could be extended. The iPhone 7s would get the first rush, followed by the iPhone Edition.It's possible.As always, stay tuned. At this stage, everything we ""know"" about the new iPhone is speculation. But with AAPL's supply chain starting to crank up for production, the pieces are beginning to fall into place.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceHow to Buy Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

How to Buy Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock the RIGHT Way;3/8/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBears fired a shot across the bow inAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMD). The recovering chipmaker has fallen 16% from its highs over the past week amid heavy profit-taking. The million-dollar question is whether this is yet another in a long line of buyable dips for AMD stock, or if it's the beginning of a more ominous reversal.makeArticleAd();Click to EnlargeSource: OptionsAnalytixLet's investigate the price action to see if there are any clues to be had.For starters, the selling sortie was sufficient to break AMD's 20-day moving average. Chalk it up as a minor victory for the bears, but more work remains before the entrenched uptrend is reversed. Thus far, prior support has held strong in the $12.50 zone. Until that levee gives way, the uptrend deserves the benefit of the doubt. Plus, AMD stock remains above rising 50-day and 200-day moving averages.A second feather in the bears' cap is the substantial volume accompanying the decline. The trio of distribution days suggests institutional selling, the likes of which could weigh on the stock for days to come. This should temper the enthusiasm of those rooting for a swift recovery from this price dip.9 Stocks to Buy That Are Growing Faster Than AmazonIt's more likely that AMD chops around a bit to work through further supply before climbing anew.How to Win With AMD Stock Right NowFortunately, the options market provides a strategy well-suited for a situation like this.Let's say you're willing to step in and buy this dip, but you want a bit of a buffer in case AMD shares fall 10% to 20% further before finally rebounding.You could sell the Apr $11 put for 35 cents or better. Worst case, Advanced Micro Devices sits below $11 at expiration, and you are obligated to buy 100 shares per contract sold at an effective purchase price of $10.65. From there, you could begin selling covered calls to further reduce your cost basis.Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Is Still ""The One""On the flip side, if AMD stock remains above $11 by expiration, the put option will expire worthless, allowing you to pocket the 35 cents per share ($35 total).The initial margin requirement for the naked put should be around $120, so although $35 doesn't sound like a large reward, it comes out to an impressive 29% return on the initial investment.As of this writing, Tyler Craig held naked puts in AMD.More From InvestorplaceBuy Ford Motor Company (F) Stock at a 12% Discount Now!3 Biotech Stocks That Could Double OvernightThe Best Investments for 2017The postHow to Buy Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Is Still “The One”;3/8/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsShares ofAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL) rebounded nicely following their short-lived but sharp post-earnings selloff in late January. This very ability of GOOGL stock to recover so quickly speaks to underlying demand and a multimonth uptrend that active investors and traders must respect until proven otherwise.makeArticleAd();When I last discussed Alphabet stock onJan. 9, I said that shares appeared to have good upside potential into late January. I wanted to target the $845-$850 area before the Jan. 26 earnings report. The stock reached the upper end of this price range by Jan. 24.Note that this was specifically a pre-earnings trade; the goal was to get out before Alphabet's report on Jan. 26.Why? Because empirically, trying to time a specific post-earnings outcome for any given stock has at best a 50% chance of success.9 Stocks to Buy That Are Growing Faster Than AmazonWhile parts of the broader stock market showed some signs of volatility in recent days, the tech-heavyNasdaq-100- as represented by thePowerShares QQQ Trust, Series 1(ETF)(NASDAQ:QQQ) - continues to motor higher. Both GOOGL stock and GOOG stock, being an important part of this index often times can flash important signals as to the next directional move in the Nasdaq-100.GOOGL Stock ChartsLooking at the big-picture multiyear weekly chart of Alphabet, we see that the uptrend (purple-dotted parallels) remains well intact. However, GOOGL is now bumping up against the very upper end of this range.Click to EnlargeAnother way of looking at this trading channel is to note that previous attempts at overshooting to the upside failed. As such, traders and investors primarily want to respect the trend.The weekly chart provides some perspective as to the possibility of another explosive move higher from here. In fairness, that likelihood is fairly low in this time frame - at least without some sort of sideways consolidation, if not an outright corrective move lower to the middle or lower end of said channel.On the daily chart, we see that GOOGL stock last November and December found support at its 200-day simple moving average (red). This was followed by a rally that pushed the stock back above its 50-day MA (yellow), which acted as support in early January and early February.Click to EnlargeThe sharp rebound following a multiday selloff on the back of the January earnings report is impressive. By last week, it had GOOGL stock bumping right back at the pre-earnings levels around $860.Sears Holdings Corp (SHLD) Is Going Bankrupt and Has No Way OutAlthough the stock has taken a little breather in recent days, on Monday, shares closed well off their intraday lows. Follow-through buying commenced on Tuesday.Active investors and traders can now use Monday's lows around $840 as a stop-loss to play the stock higher for a trade to new highs with a first upside price target around $870-$880.More conservative traders may want to first wait for GOOGL stock to close back above the $855 area before legging into this trade.Like what you see?

YouTube Officially Enters the Skinny Bundle TV Business;3/7/2017;"In this segment from theMarket Foolery, the team digs into the latest salvo in the cord-cutting   wars with the release of YouTube TV, which stands out with its   unlimited cloud-based DVR. And when it comes to monetization,   being a subsidiary ofAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) gives the service a serious   advantage.A full transcript follows the video.10 stocks we like better than NetflixWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run     for over a decade,Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has tripled the market.*makeArticleAd();David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy right now... and Netflix wasn't one of     them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even     better buys.Click hereto learn about these picks!*Stock Advisor returns as of February 6, 2017This video was recorded on March 1, 2016.Mac Greer:On Tuesday, YouTube introduced YouTube TV. For $35 a month, you   get around 40 streaming channels. That includes the major   networks -- ESPN, Fox News, MSNBC. David, YouTube is also   partnered with local TV stations, so you could get local sports   and news. Now, what you do not get is CNN, HBO, AMC, A&E,   Comedy Central. So, there are some channels missing there. A lot   of competition in this space. I guess the phrase that pays is   ""skinny bundle."" There are a lot of skinny bundles with Sling and   the like. What do you make of YouTube?David Kretzmann:I think the two advantages that YouTube has here, potentially,   and they say that they are negotiating with other content   partners, so hopefully they can get some of those other partners   on board onto this package, but, the two things that stick out to   me that YouTube can do probably better than anyone else,   especially with the current players, they're offering unlimited   cloud-based DVR storage. Essentially, you'll be able to record up   to nine months of content on YouTube. So, they're leveraging the   dominant Google Cloud infrastructure in business that Alphabethas   built up over the years. That's something you can't do with Sling   TV. With Sling TV, you can only watch it live. You can't record   something, you can't set up to record something ahead of time.   You either watch it live or you miss it. I think that unlimited   cloud-based DVR aspect, that's a really user-friendly aspect that   tears into the traditional linear TV model. I think it makes the   skinny bundle model, or that online streaming model, much more   appealing and attractive for users. The other thing that sticks   out to me that YouTube could probably do really well down the   road is advertising. You could essentially, what Google could   offer advertisers is say, ""We know this individual, they search   for these products, they have these Search terms on Google, they   have these viewing habits on YouTube."" I think Google could   arguably do a better job than anyone else of really personalizing   and targeting individual ads to users. So, your live TV ads would   be different from Matt's, so to speak. I don't know if that's   necessarily the plan right now right off the bat, but I think   down the road, that is something that could really play to   YouTube's advantage.Matt Argersinger:It's fascinating to watch the evolution of the TV digital   streaming market, whatever you want to call it. But in a way, I   almost feel like we're coming full circle. If you think about it,   when I learned that YouTube was going to have ESPN, I thought,   that's huge, that's very compelling. But then, I say, wait, I   still want CNN, I like AMC, I still want HBO. So, I start to   think to myself, wait, I'm probably going to need two or three   skinny bundles. Plus HBO Now, plusNetflix. Then all of the sudden I'm paying over $100 a month anyway, and   then it's like, why don't I just stick with my cable   subscription?Greer:I need a keyboard to go with my iPad.Argersinger:It's interesting. I think, if you really ask a consumer what they   want, they want the true à la carte service. Just give me the 15   channels I want plus HBO and plus Netflix. That's what I want.   And I'll pay a fee for that. But the bundling continues, and   that's something that cable companies have done successfully for   decades now. So, it seems like we're coming full circle with the   TV market.Greers:Guys, this really also seems like kind of a play for the future.Piper Jaffrayhad a recent report that said 26% of teens watch YouTube   every day. As those teens get older, and as they make more and   more purchasing decisions, maybe YouTube TV becomes their   television.Argersinger:It's already a tremendous brand. If you think about, amazingly,   if you think about the Mount Rushmore of online properties,   YouTube is absolutely there right next to Google which acquired,   brilliantly, YouTube some 10 years ago now. Amazing.Kretzmann:Yeah, and the Wall Street Journal just reported that the amount   of content viewed on YouTube each day is now a billion hours a   day. That's up 10X since 2012. So, the level of engagement that   is on YouTube already is staggering. I think this TV offering, I   think this is one of the more attractive TV offerings, aside from   those properties that aren't included in this initial bundle. But   I think with that cloud storage, that makes it very appealing,   especially to younger viewers who don't necessarily want to sit   down and watch a live show from eight to nine at night. They want   to watch it whenever they want. They don't want to watch   commercials. So, with that cloud storage, you can watch it when   you want, you can skip the commercials. From a user experience   perspective, I just think that's far and away above live TV,   whether it's through a traditional cable package or online   streaming. People just want to watch things on their own terms. I   think this skinny bundle offering with YouTube is moving closer   to that direction. But like Matt said, it's still not true à la   carte. I think, ideally, people would pay $5 for CNN, $10 for   ESPN, they'd be able to just pick --Argersinger:$20 for the NFL games that I want to watch this month.Kretzmann:Right. And potentially just paying for a game. Maybe I'm not an   NFL fan, but I'll pay to watch the Superbowl, or something like   that. I think it'll be interesting to see if we move in that   direction. I think from a user experience perspective, that's   probably what most people would like. But whether or not the   cable companies let that happen, they'll certainly be resistant   to moving in that direction.Greer:How about, best thing you have watched recently, as we close?Argersinger:Let's see ... I watched this show calledTravelerson Netflix. I don't know if you've seen it, it's one of those   Netflix Original Series. Really well done. It's a slow starter,   as a lot of these series are. But by the fourth or fifth episode,   I was addicted, and I think my wife and I binged in like three   nights. It was good stuff.Kretzmann:I recently watched Sneaky Pete --Greer:Solid.Kretzmann:-- which is one of the most recentAmazonOriginals.

Will Snapchat Become the Next Twitter or Facebook?;3/7/2017;"After months of speculations,Snap Inc., the parent company of social media mobile app Snapchat, finally got listed on the New York Stock Exchange last week. With this, arguments whether the company will become more like FacebookFBor turn to TwitterTWTRin the next few years, have heated up.Notably, shares of the two established social media companies - Facebook and Twitter - have taken divergent paths since their respective Initial Public Offerings (IPO). At yesterday's closing price, Facebook is up 261.6% from its IPO price; while Twitter is trading 40.2% down from its IPO price.Undoubtedly, neither the company nor the stakeholders will ever prefer it to become like Twitter, which is witnessing declining user base, revenues and earnings. On the contrary, it will like to become more like Facebook or even better, which has seen a tremendous rise in user base, revenues as well as earnings.Although, it will be quite early to forecast where the company will find itself after five years from now; the business model demonstrates both positive and negative aspects following thestock's recent decline post IPO.What Makes it More like FacebookSnap is known for its social media mobile app - Snapchat - which was founded in 2011, and officially launched in 2012. The app allows users to take photos and record videos, as well as facilitate editing options and share the same with friends. However, photos or videos can be viewed for few seconds only and then they disappear, and also cannot be saved.Since its launch, the app has been steadily getting popular among teenagers, thanks to its consistent focus on introducing new and unique features. Per the company, the app had 158 million daily active users per day at the end of 2016, which represented year-over-year growth of 48%. Of these, majority are between 18 and 34 years old. The daily users visit the Snapchat app more than 20 times a day, on an average, and spend over 30 minutes.Although, the daily active user count is way lesser than Facebook's over 1.20 billion, it has already surpassed Twitter's over 130-million daily visitors. Also, the rate at which it is growing, it has the potential to reduce the gap with Facebook.Going ahead, the best part of the company is that it has been able to monetize the app. The company does not follow the typical Internet advertising model of charging per click; rather it charges advertisers per day. The consistently growing daily active user base has been attracting more and more consumers.Apart from this, the company's Snapchat Discover feature has expanded its picture and video library, thereby attracting more and more advertisers. The feature also allows the company to partner with major events like the Oscars and Super Bowl. Discover currently accounts for a majority of the company's advertising revenue.It should be noted that the company registered almost a seven-fold year-over-year jump in its 2016 revenues, which reached $404.9 million from $58.7 million recorded in 2015. Going ahead, the company projects its annual revenues and daily active user base to reach approximately $2 billion and 221 million, respectively, in 2018.Snap's constant efforts in introducing new and unique app features, along with its innovative adverting ideas, will enable it in achieving its target.Despite this, it will be far lesser than Facebook, which generated $27.6 billion revenues in 2016, and is still growing. However, if Snap achieved its target for 2018, it will certainly be closing its gap with Twitter which generated $2.5 billion in revenues and has been witnessing a slowdown in growth rate.Why It May Fall to TwitterLooking at the above discussion, it seems that Snap does look like Facebook. However, there are a number of challenges which may trouble it in becoming the next Facebook and put it in Twitter's shoes.The major threat comes from Facebook which introduced the new ""Stories"" feature at its Instagram app last year. This new feature allows users to post photos and video slideshows which disappear after a 24-hour period. Instagram stories directly mirror Snapchat's own stories feature. Reportedly, after this launch, Snapchat has recorded a slowdown in its users' growth rate in the second half of 2016.The second major concern is that even after five years of journey, the company has failed to make itself profitable just like Twitter before its IPO. On the contrary, Facebook had made over $1 billion of profit in the fiscal year just before its IPO in 2012.Furthermore, since the early days of Snapchat, this disappearing messaging app has been associated with sexting. Snapchat has also dealt with a few other embarrassing issues, including two different racially insensitive filters. All this may put the company in unnecessary controversies and bring in unwanted investigation.ConclusionInvestors ideally vision Snap to grow like Facebook and not become Twitter. However, we believe that Facebook's well established position in the social media industry, ever-growing user base and the popular Instagram service are significant threat to Snapchat's growth prospects.In addition, the company will have a tough task grabbing market share in the digital ad space, which is mainly dominated by Facebook and AlphabetGOOGLaka Google.Want to learn more about Snapchat stock?

Instagram: How Facebook's Photo-Sharing App Makes Money;3/7/2017;"Instagram, the photo-sharing app, created by Kevin Systrom and Mike Kreiger in 2010, is now one of the most popular apps among users. The companyreportedreaching half a billion monthly active users in June 2016.In April of 2012, FacebookFB, the social media giant, acquired Instagram for about $1 billion in cash and stock. At the time, Instagram had only been around for less than two years, with initial funding of $500,000 from Baseline Ventures and Andreessen Horowitz. It was the largest acquisition that Facebook made before its IPO in May 2012 and many on the outside had questioned the purchase.So How Does Instagram Makes Money?Just like its parent company, Instagram makes all of its money from selling advertising. Instagram has three types of ads: image ads, video ads and carousel ads.The ads are shared directly on users' newsfeed and Stories. As the users scroll through their newsfeed, ads are distributed between actual users' content. The users then have the option to follow the brand's account or to click on an ad to learn more about its product or service.Similar to newsfeed, ads are also distributed on Instagram's Stories, a SnapchatSNAP-like feature that lets users share temporary pictures or videos.Users will see the ads in one of the three ad types and have the option to skip or click on the ad.Instagram's advertisers include Nike Inc.NKE, General ElectricGEand GoogleGOOGL.Bottom LineThough Facebook doesn't disclose Instagram's financials,Fortunereportedthat Instagram said they now had 500,000 advertisers back in September 2016. Analysts from Credit Suisse said Instagram is estimated to have $5.3 billion in revenues.In Facebook's 2016 fourth quarter earnings report, the company reported 1.2 billion daily active users worldwide and $8.6 billion in advertising sales. Though it is noted that the 1.2 billion users don't include sole users of Instagram, WhatsApp or Oculus, many users do use a combination of all three both, and Instagram accounts are often linked with a user's Facebook account.makeArticleAd();Long-Term Buys You Won't See in the NewsThe stocks you see in today's headlines may not be in the news tomorrow or next week.

Go Long Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock For Free;3/7/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAlphabet Inc's(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) stock price may appear extended as it hovers near its all-time high. In addition, thePowerShares QQQ Trust, Series 1 (ETF)(NASDAQ:QQQ) is also near all-time highs. This makes for a potentially precarious perch for leader stocks.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockBut GOOGL stock has no apparent reason to worry. Its stock is only in the middle of a 12-month ascending range in prices. So as long as markets don't suffer a severe setback, Alphabet should stay on track.Fundamentally, Alphabet management is a proven winner. Over the past few years, they addressed most of their critics' sticking points. Now the company is a money-printing machine, with several more sources of income soon to come. GOOGL owns several properties with over a billion users each that are yet to be monetized.Click to EnlargeAlphabet also has interesting forays into the auto industry, specifically in the self-driving arena.

They are both likely to inflict damage to the NFLX profit and loss statement.Technically, although the stock in on an upward trajectory, it doesn't mean that GOOGL isn't open to potential drops. But investors would likely use them as entry points.7 Stocks That Will Hit All-Time Lows in 2017Today I will use the options markets to create income from selling into a range inside which GOOGL stock is likely to stay.GOOGL Stock Trade IdeaThe Bet:Sell the GOOGL Sep $750/$740 credit put spread. This is a bullish trade for which I collect $1.80 per contract to open or better. The price buffer from current levels gives this trade a 90% theoretical chance of success to yield about 20% on money risked.I usually like to balance my trade. In this case I will sell opposing risk to hedge my bet.The Hedge (Optional):Sell GOOGL Sep $990/$1,000 credit call spread. This is a bearish trade for which I collect 70 cents per contract to open. To win I need GOOGL to stay below my sold risk. This side alone has a 90% theoretical chance of success to yield 13% on risk.Taking both trades would constitute a sold iron condor for which I collect $2.50 per contract to open. The overall position reduces my risk since I can only lose on one side or the other. If GOOGL stock stays between my spreads this trade would yield 33% on money risked.I am not required to hold my trades open through expiration. I can close either side for partial gains or losses at any time.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director ofSellSpreads.com.

Will Spotify Stream Into an IPO in 2017?;3/7/2017;"Launched in 2008 by entrepreneurs Daniel Ek and Martin Lorentzon, Stockholm, Sweden-basedSpotifyis one of the most popular streaming services on the market today. With its desktop and mobile app version, the company allows users to search or browse, for free, through its extensive music library. Spotify also offers a ""Premium"" subscription for $9.99 per month that removes advertisements and lets users download music to listen to offline.CompetitionSpotify recently announced that it now has 100 million monthly active users, with 50 million paying for the service. This achievement has cemented its status as the biggest subscription music service by user count, and the leader in the increasingly crowded music streaming industry.Arguably Spotify's biggest market rival is Apple'sAAPLApple Music. Launched in 2015, Apple Music is a streaming music service based on Beats Music, which has drawn listeners with playlists made by experts, not algorithms. The service is also known for its collaborations with high-profile musicians like Drake and Taylor Swift. It costs $9.99 per month, and users can download music from an extensive digital library, just like Spotify. Apple Music offers listeners a free, three-month initial trial.There's also Tidal, the Scandinavian streaming service that rapper and mogul Jay Z scooped up back in 2015 for $56 million. It has a similar price of $9.99 per month for normal streaming, while also offering a $19.99 per month option that includes high-fidelity sound quality. Like Apple Music, Tidal is known for its partnerships with big music names. Rihanna, Beyoncé, and Kanye West all exclusively debuted their latest albums on Tidal before a wider release.Other top rivals include Rdio, which provides access to online radio stations, with different levels of on-demand access, for $3.99 to $9.99 per month; PandoraP, one of the original internet radio companies, goes for $4.99 per month to avoid ads; Rhapsody, the original streaming music subscription service, has been around since 2001, and is available for $9.99 per month; and Alphabet Inc.'sGOOGLGoogle Play Music, which offers online music storage and a streaming service for $9.99 per month.ControversiesDespite its popularity, Spotify tends to draw out negative publicity, mainly over debates about its free advertising-supported service. This service allows people who are prepared to sit through occasional ads to listen to songs for free on demand. Music labels-Spotify is in compliance with SonySNE, EMI, Warner Music Group, and Universal, among others-understandably dislike the free service because it dismantles album sales, and pays less in royalties than the subscription does.We all remember Spotify's battle with Taylor Swift. The popstar withdrew her entire catalog from the service because she ""didn't like the way it felt. I think there should be an inherent value placed on art. I didn't see that happening, perception-wise, when I put my music on Spotify,"" shesaid in an interviewwithTime.Other musicians soon followed in her footsteps. Icelandic singer Björk made her latest albumVulnicuraunavailable on Spotify and other streaming services, though her back catalogue remained available. And in 2015, British songstress Adele similarly restricted her Grammy-winning album25from all streaming services-however, you can currently listen to it on Spotify, along with her other albums,19and21-on its release date,tellingTimethat ""I believe music should be an event.""Last year, Spotify was embroiled in issues surrounding its updated Terms and Conditions of Use, where in ablog post, the company's user communications manager Candace Katz explains ""We may ask for customer permission to collect information from new sources, such as address book, location, and sensor data [and photos, voice controls, and contacts] from the mobile device to improve the customer experience and inform product decisions.""This unexpectedly caused an uproar, with many calling Spotify's new privacy policy ""eerie"" and ""creepy"" and pledging to unsubscribe from the service. The backlash was bad enough that CEO Ek wrote another blog post, aptly called ""SORRY"" in order to explain that users don't have to share this information if they don't want to. ""We will ask for your express permission before accessing any of this data - and we will only use it for specific purposes that will allow you to customize your Spotify experience.""An IPO on the Horizon?Over the past few years or so, Spotify has been on the hunt for new funding. The company closed funding rounds in 2012 and 2013, raising $100 million and $250 million, respectively. In 2016, Spotify completed a whopping $526 million round of funding, putting it at a valuation of roughly $8.5 billion, a move that showed investors its desire for expansion and new forms of content-a few months before this funding round, Spotify announced its plan to add videos and podcasts from partners like ESPN, NBC, Comedy Central, and Condé Nast.And about a year ago, the company raised $1 billion in convertible debt on the promise that its new investors will receive a 30% discount on shares when it files for an IPO. Spotify will have to pay 5% annual interest on the debt, however, and 1% more every six months, up to a total of 10%, until it goes public.This decision to raise money through convertible debt was a smart move, as Spotify was able to maintain its high valuation without diluting its existing shareholders. It does suggest the company is seriously thinking about an IPO, since the latest round of funding encourages Spotify to go public sooner rather than later.Or, at least, that's what was originally thought.According toTechCrunch, Spotify is apparently considering delaying its IPO to 2018, with sources saying the company wants to use the time to ""build a better balance sheet and work on shifting its business model to improve its margins."" But in reality, the delay is likely linked to Spotify's inability to finalize new licensing deals with the big record labels like Universal, Sony, and Warner, whom control 80% of recorded music.There's no doubt about Spotify's rapid growth and universal reach, but it remains unprofitable mostly because of the fees paid to these music labels. The company supposedly pays a royalty rate of 55% of its sales, and is fighting to pay less. Nevertheless, its impressive valuation-aTechCrunchsource hopes to target a valuation between $11 billion and $13 billion--and popularity will work in their favor when their public debut comes. Patience is a virtue, fellow investor, so sit back, relax, and wait for Spotify's exciting future.Now That Snapchat is Public, Which Tech Giant Could IPO   Next?You may be curious about the buzz surrounding Snap's IPO, but should you buy up this tech stock?

No, Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Isn’t Expensive;3/7/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhat's particularly interesting aboutFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) stock at the moment is that it's rather inexpensive. In fact, it's downright cheap. That perhaps seems odd, given that Facebook stock is worth almost $400 billion, not to mention that FB stock is at an all-time high and that the Facebook stock price has risen by a factor of eight times in barely four years.makeArticleAd();Source:SilverIsdead Via FlickrBut it's true, at least on an earnings basis. FB stock trades at about 21x analyst estimates for 2017 EPS, and around 20x 2018 figures. Backing out the company's roughly $10 per share in cash, the multiples drop to 23.4x for 2017 and, incredibly, just 19x for 2018.TheS&P 500index trades at about 18x-plus 2017 profits and 17x 2018 figures. That means, somewhat incredibly, that Facebook stock trades at a multiple not far above the average U.S. large cap stock.Coming off a year where FB grew revenue 57% and doubled operating income, that seems ridiculously low. And compared to the post-IPO valuation ofSnap Inc(NYSE:SNAP), it seems almost absurd.There are some reasons for FB's relatively low multiple - but not enough, in my opinion. Comparing Facebook to SNAP and other high-growth stocks, it's hard to come to anything but one conclusion. Facebook stock likely has more room to run.Facebook Stock Is Cheaper Than Most High-FlyersWhatever one thinks of the SNAP IPO, it certainly highlights just how reasonable Facebook's valuation is in comparison. Snap Inc, of course, is unprofitable, which makes price-to-earnings comparisons impossible. But at the moment, SNAP trades at an enterprise value to revenue multiple of about 47x. That multiple would value FB stock at $550 - and all of Facebook stockat about $1.6 trillion.5 Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy in MarchObviously, that's a bit of a facetious example. Facebook's revenue growth is expected to slow in 2017, by the company's own admission. Snap, in contrast, still is learning how to actually monetize its user base. (Interestingly, SNAP's price per user metric is barely half that of FB.) And Snap's valuation - impacted by post-IPO volatility - likely isn't as true as that of FB stock.More established peers still highlight an apparent discount for Facebook stock, however.Amazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) trades at 65x 2018 analyst estimates - a multiple more thantriplethat of FB.Netflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX) is in the same range.Both those companies have higher projected growth and lower margins - which implies room to ramp up earnings once those businesses mature. It's hardly the case that FB stock should trade at the same levels. But the comparison also seems to imply that Facebook stock is a safer play: while investors in AMZN and NFLX are betting on growth years out, Facebook investors need only worry about the near future.FB Stock Versus GOOGLThe more interesting comparison is between FB andAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL). Alphabet has growth worries of its own, as falling per-click ad rates have pressured margins for some time. Beyond the core search business, Google's initiatives have had mixed success. Investments in self-driving cars and virtual reality are years, if not decades, away from bearing fruit. So-called IoT (Internet of Things) products like Nest and Google Home are facing tough competition from Amazon's Alexa and a number of startups.But Alphabet stock is valued right in line with Facebook's. Backing out the company's nearly $100 per share in net cash, GOOGL trades at 22x 2017 consensus and 19x 2018. Both figures are pretty much right in line with that of FB stock.That doesn't seem right. While Facebook has admitted to slowing growth in its core business, Alphabet's core business, Google, is seeing outright pressure.More broadly, the bet on Facebook stock versus Alphabet and Google is a bet on how consumers in the future will use the internet. And Facebook's continuing growth and global dominance appears to give it an advantage. That advantage - at the same valuation - would seem to argue for a long position in FB over GOOGL.Is Facebook a Buy Then?The fact that FB stock is cheaper than peers on its own doesn't suggest a buy. Some investors - and many analysts - believe SNAP is wildly overvalued. AMZN and NFLX have valuation questions of their own. Alphabet stock is at an all-time high as well. It's not impossible to be right that Facebook is cheaper than all those stocks - and yet still see Facebook stock decline, if by less than those peers.And there are risks specific to Facebook stock. The most notable is whether the platform can keep its dominance. Facebook may not be the nextMyspace- but it's likely that at some point, another social networking company will come along. Given the fickle tastes of younger consumers, in particular, the core question for FB stock is whether it will still bethedominant platform in 20 years, or even 10.Apple Inc. (AAPL) Can't Commit to HollywoodFor now, however, that risk seems priced in, and then some. We're nearing a point where the market is pricing Facebook like 'just another company' - but Facebook isn't just another company. It's a dominant global player, with huge margins. It's already profitable in a way that Snap and evenTwitter Inc(NYSE:TWTR) can only hope to be. And that dominance provides a huge moat around the business: if everyone already is on Facebook, it's even more difficult to get them to leave.So the market doesn't seem to be pricing FB stock accordingly - even considering the risk involved. A sub-20x forward multiple is fitting for a low-growth, established company. Facebook is established - but it still isn't anywhere near low-growth.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.More From InvestorPlace3 High-Yield Stocks of 14%-Plus: Are They Safe?9 High-Yielding Dividend Stocks To Safeguard Your IncomeThe postNo, Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Isn't Expensiveappeared first onInvestorPlace."

3 Reasons the Lowe’s Companies, Inc. (LOW) Stock Rally Will Continue;3/7/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOn the heels of a standout earnings report last week,Lowe's Companies, Inc.(NYSE:LOW) shares gained about 7%. It stood in stark contrast to many other retailers - likeMacy's Inc(NYSE:M) andTarget Corporation(NYSE:TGT) - that have struggled with the impact of e-commerce. Let's face it, the mightyAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) continues to wreak havoc on brick-and-mortar operators.makeArticleAd();Source:Mike Mozart via Flickr (modified)But so far, Lowe's has been immune. Then again, when it comes to home improvement, consumers still like to make a visit to a big-box location.OK then, so what about Lowe's stock now? Is there still room on the upside? Well, I think so. For the most part, the momentum looks sustainable for LOW stock. And here are three reasons to keep in mind:Reason No. 1 for Lowe's Stock: Positive Macro EnvironmentAgain, the latest quarterly report shows that the company is on a nice growth path. Note that revenues jumped19% to $15.78 billionand comparable sales rose by 5.1%. By comparison, the Street consensus was looking for revenues of $15.39 billion and comparable store sales of only 2.4%A key to the strength is the positive fundamentals for the home improvement industry. After all, there has been a steady increase in real estate prices, which has encouraged more spending.5 Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy in MarchAccording toLowe's CEO Robert Niblock: ""Expected growth in the home improvement market is further support of the results of our fourth quarter consumer sentiment survey, which revealed that post election, homeowners have an increasingly favorable view of the national economy and their personal financial situations and we believe this trend will continue, as almost half of the homeowners we surveyed indicate that they are very likely to begin a home improvement project in the next six months, and more than half of homeowners believe that home values are rising and will continue to increase.""Reason No. 2 for LOW Stock: Omnichannel SuccessIn the retail world, the concept of ""omnichannel"" is a common buzzword. It's essentially about providing customers with consistent experiences across in-store and digital platforms.Of course, LOW stock has been pursuing this strategy for some time, such as with a revamped website and improved mobile apps. Oh, and there have even been cutting-edge innovations with VR (Virtual Reality) and robots, which help answer questions in Lowe's locations.And the investments are really starting to pay off. During the latest quarter, the comp growth for Lowes.com jumped by 25%. Interestingly enough, digital traffic is growing at 15 times the store traffic since 2010 and mobile accounts for a quarter of overall traffic.LOW stock has also been skillful with leveraging online channels for marketing and branding campaigns. For example, the company's Pinterest page has over 3.4 million users. What's more, Lowe's has been active in creating engaging videos for platforms likeFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB),Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) TV,Alphabet Inc's(NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) YouTube,Amazon.com, Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AMZN) FireTV andRoku.Yet the omnichannel strategy has not just been about technology. Just look at the rollout of the interior project specialist program.Is Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Really Going to Crash 26%?This involves highly trained employees who help customers to plan, design and complete home improvement projects.Reason No. 3 for Lowe's Stock: Shareholder ValueDuring the fiscal year, the companyrepurchased $3.5 billionof Lowe's stock. And yes, the board recently authorized a new program for up to$5 billion in buybacks.As for the valuation on Lowe's stock, it is fairly reasonable. Keep in mind that the forward price-to-earnings ratio is 15X. By comparison,Home Depot Inc(NYSE:HD) trades at a multiple of 18X.Tom Taulli runs the InvestorPlace blogIPO Playbookand is the author of various books, includingTaxes 2017: Saving A Bundle.Follow him on Twitter at@ttaulli.

Why Baidu Inc. Probably Won't Spin Off iQiyi.com;3/7/2017;"In late February,Baidu's(NASDAQ: BIDU) video  streaming subsidiary iQiyi raised   $1.53 billion in fresh funds to compete more effectively with   rival sites. Hillhouse Capital, IDG Capital, Sequoia Capital, and   Baidu all purchased the newly issued convertible bonds, and Baidu   disclosed that it had invested $300 million.iQiyi is the largest video streaming site in China, but it   currently faces tough competition fromTencent(NASDAQOTH: TCEHY) Video andAlibaba's Youku Tudou. iQiyi has  been losing money since Baidu   purchased a majority stake in 2012, which has repeatedly sparked   calls for Baidu to sell or spin-off the company to boost its   profitability.The iQiyi app for Android tablets. Image source: Google     Play.makeArticleAd();Last December, theWall Street Journalreported that Baidu was planning to spin off iQiyi in an IPO   which could raise $1 billion. Baidu denied those rumors, and CEO   Robin Li reiterated after the recent bond offering that the site   was ""a great asset and an important part of the Baidu ecosystem.""   Let's take a closer look at iQiyi, and why Baidu prefers to raise   capital through convertible bonds rather than spin off the   company in an IPO.A brief look at iQiyi's historyBaidu and American private equity firm Providence Equity   Partners co-founded iQiyi in 2010. In 2012, Baidu bought out   Providence's stake to become the dominant investor. It acquired   the  popular online video business of PPStream the following   year, and launched its own film production division in 2014. That   same year, smartphone giantXiaomiand Shunwei Capital acquired a 10%-15% stake in  iQiyi for   $300 million.In 2015, it acquired the online rights to top entertainment   shows in China, Taiwan, and  South Korea -- including the   popular Korean variety showRunning Man. In 2016, iQiyi launched in  Taiwan, marking its first step   outside of mainland China.During last quarter's conference call , Robin Li stated that   iQiyi ""performed very well,"" with ""revenue and subscriber numbers   ramping up nicely."" According to iResearch's Dec. 2016 numbers,   iQiyi's mobile app remained the top video streaming app in China,   with 125 million daily active users and 480 million monthly   active users, and streamed 335 billion minutes of   monthly content.iQiyi generates most of its revenue from ads, but it launched   a paid service in 2015 that lets subscribers get earlier or   exclusive access to blockbuster shows. iQiyi claimed the service   reached 20 million subscribers last June, up from 5 million at   the end of May 2015.But profitability is toughOn the conference call, Robin Li stated that Baidu planned to   support iQiyi's ""further growth,"" but noted that higher content   acquisition costs at the site caused its total content costs to   rise from 5.6% of revenues in 2015 to 11% in 2016. That statement   raises some concerns when we look at Baidu's operating margins   over the past five years.Source:YChartsRobin Li still hasn't provided a timeline for iQiyi's bottom   line to break even, but CFO Jennifer Li noted that margins were   ""improving"", and that they would continue doing so in the future.   She also stated that to keep costs under control, Baidu will   invest more heavily in original content to ""further strengthen   and expand"" its subscription user base.YouTube faces the same challengesMaking a profit from streaming video is very tough. The   platform might generate revenue with ads and subscriptions, but   those gains often can't offset the costs of hosting videos on   servers and content acquisition costs.EvenAlphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) YouTube, the biggest streaming   video platform in the  world with over a billion users,   remains unprofitable due to those pressures. Last October,   YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki stated that the 12-year-old site was   ""still in investment mode,"" and that there was ""no timetable"" for   achieving profitability. Like iQiyi, YouTube offers a premium   subscription platform, YouTube Red, but the  service   reportedly only had 1.5 million subscribers at the end of last   summer.Baidu and Alphabet are willing to take losses on iQiyi and   YouTube for a simple reason: streaming videos tether more users   to their ecosystems. If those viewers use iQiyi they're more   likely to use other services -- like Baidu Maps, Search, and   Wallet -- instead of services from rivals like Tencent . Both   companies can also track watched videos, which gives them more   data for targeted ads.The key takeawayiQiyi will probably keep losing money for years, but investors   shouldn't fret over those losses. The platform brings more users   into Baidu's ecosystem, which widens its moat against other   companies and ensures that it remains the top internet   advertising platform in China. Therefore, investors shouldn't   expect Baidu to spin off iQiyi any more than they expect Alphabet   to spin off YouTube.10 stocks we like better than BaiduWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Will Salesforce.com, Inc. (CRM) Sell Out to International Business Machines Corp. (IBM)?;3/7/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSalesforce.com, Inc.(NYSE:CRM), whose rapid growth makes up for a compelling shortage of earnings, warned shareholders that its first quarter may not be what they hope for. Investors have yet to show their feelings by fleeing CRM stock, however.makeArticleAd();Source:TopoI6 Via FlickrInstead, analysts listened to the soothing tones of its earnings call, where the company bragged about its past and predicted $10 billion in revenue for the coming year.Few seem to have noticed the fine print.Profits for the first quarterare going to be down. That $10 billion in revenue is not going to represent much growth over the fourth quarter's $2.3 billion sale rate.Slower growth could hammer the stock, whose market cap of $57 billion means a price to sales ratio of 5.7, assuming the company meets its estimates. That's a ratio comparable to that ofAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL), only without the profits of Google.For CRM stock, the future is now. But perhaps, by forging an alliance withInternational Business Machines Corp.(NYSE:IBM), its future now might be in its past.Looking Beyond the CloudSalesforce has more than doubled its revenues since 2012 based on cloud applications. The company's ticker symbol, CRM, stands for Customer Relationship Management, the first major enterprise database application to move from corporate data centers into less-expensive clouds. But since then the company has built a full suite of such applications, and all have been successful.7 Stocks That Will Hit All-Time Lows in 2017The enterprise cloud has been very, very good for Salesforce.com, and competitors have done more than take notice. Cloud is now the default home of major database applications. Competitors likeMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT),Oracle Corporation(NYSE:ORCL) and IBM all now brag about the size of their clouds, and the sophistication of enterprise applications built on them.The S-shaped ""sales curve,"" of slow growth in a new market, rocket-like growth as mass markets adopt something and slower growth once that is achieved, is approaching the end of the line for cloud. CRM stock bulls insist that things like the internet of thingswill keep growth going, but each new niche now brings big-time competitors with it, such asGeneral Electric Company(NYSE:GE), which calls its industrial IoT cloud Predix.Alliance TimeAs markets mature, they consolidate. Competitors pair up, starting with alliances, then moving naturally toward mergers. Having fewer competitors means they can maintain pricing, and margins, even as growth slows.This is why some analysts are pushinga merger-of-equals that won't happenbetween Salesforce andAdobe Systems Inc.(NASDAQ:ADBE), whose ""Creative Cloud"" applications would seem a natural fit.Salesforce's strategy has been to pick-off smaller application spaces as they appear, as with its 2016 buy ofDemandware, which serves online merchants, acquired for $2.8 billion. The company made10 acquisitions during 2016, and in January it continued this withSequence, which designs user interfaces, a business now dubbed UX for User Experience.As a software house, rather than a hardware company, Salesforce has always had to manage its hosting carefully. Its original code came from Oracle, and the companies have had a fraught existence. So over the years, Salesforce has added Microsoft andAmazon.com Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) toits partner list, although these relationships are, like love, subject to change on the first suspicion of betrayal.Snap Inc (SNAP) Stock: Stay Away at All Costs!You canadd IBM to the list. Salesforce will now mix its data with IBM's Watson - a quick route into artificial intelligence and, perhaps, into IBM itself.Where the Ride Ends for CRM StockI believe the end of the ride for Salesforce is in sight and IBM would make a compelling destination. IBM now sells at half its sales, its revenues have been declining for years, and Salesforce could halt that slide. With CEO Virginia Rometty approaching 60, often a retirement age at Big Blue, Benioff might make a natural successor at age 52.Benioff would also give IBM a more entrepreneurial face, and IBM would give him a much bigger playing field on which to perform cloud magic. He has been telling all who would listen that a ""roaring"" market meansSalesforce is not interested in acquisitions.How about a sale?Dana Blankenhornis a financial and technology journalist.

The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights: Johnson & Johnson, Alphabet, Schlumberger, Alibaba and Public Storage;3/7/2017;"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL -March 07, 2017 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog includeJohnson & Johnson(NYSE:JNJ-Free Report),Alphabet(NASDAQ:GOOGL-Free Report),Schlumberger(NYSE:SLB-Free Report),Alibaba(NYSE:BABA-Free Report) andPublic Storage(NYSE:PSA-Free Report).Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations.Get #1Stock of the Day pick for free.Here are highlights from Monday's Analyst Blog:Top Research Reports for Tuesday: JNJ, GOOGL, SLBmakeArticleAd();Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ-Free Report), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL-Free Report) and Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB-Free Report).Johnson & Johnsonhave gained +15.8% over the last year, widely outperforming the large-cap pharma space (up +6.6%). J&J reported mixed fourth-quarter results, beating on earnings but missing on sales. However, the 2017 sales outlook was disappointing due to an expected slowdown in Pharma sales as a number of key growth drivers like Remicade and Concerta are facing competition.While the company is faced with a number of headwinds like unfavorable currency movements, increased competition from generics, pricing pressures and an uncertain global macroeconomic backdrop, the analyst believes that JNJ's diversified business model, deep product pipeline, lack of cyclicality and financial strength position it for continued momentum going forward. (You canread the full research report on Johnson &   Johnsonhere.)Alphabet's shares have lagged the Zacks Tech sector marginally over the past year gaining +19% vs. +19.7%, with the company's weaker than expected Q4 earnings report only adding to its underperformance. These headwinds aside, the Zacks analyst points out the company's good execution to date, more or less maintaining its dominant share in a competitive, fast-growing search market.The company's focus on innovation, strategic acquisitions and Android OS should continue to generate strong cash flows. However, the promise of Google's non-search businesses continue getting pushed into future even as the company's spending keeps rising. On Feb 23, 2017, Alphabet Inc.'s Waymo sued Uber and its subsidiary Otto, alleging intellectual property theft and patent violation. (You canread the full research report on Alphabet here.)Schlumberger's shares underperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas Field Services industry over the last one year, gaining +6.4% vs. the sector's +16% increase. The Zacks analyst likes the continuous and effective cost-management initiatives of the company. The Schlumberger-Cameron merger will support technology-driven growth, going forward. The company's focus on international markets also deserves appreciation. Schlumberger's current dividend yield of 2.5% has outpaced both 1.9% yield for its broader sector and the 1.4% yield for rival, Halliburton Company.However, commodity price volatility remains an overhang on the stock. Additionally, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter 2017 earnings has been revised downward over the last 60 days.

Alexa CAN Drive Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock … Someday;3/7/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) continues to roll along. AMZN stock trades just off all-time highs at the moment, having gained over 2,000% over the past 10 years.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockWhile some investors point to the price-to-earnings ratio of Amazon stock as a potential danger sign, I think that viewis short-sighted. The company's legacy business continues to change the face of U.S. retailing. Witness the sharp decline this week atTarget Corporation(NYSE:TGT), which seems directly attributed to Amazon's online success.Of course, online retail isn't the only area where AMZN is having success - or where increased profits can drive Amazon stock higher. The company's Amazon Web Services (AWS) business has become a dominant player in cloud.And, of late, the company's Amazon Echo, built on the Alexa Voice Service, has added another layer to the bull case for AMZN stock.Though I remain bullish on AMZN, I don't think Alexa really changes the value of Amazon stock - at least not yet. Amazon is too big and Amazon Echo usage is too spotty, for Alexa and/or Echo to drive impressive sales or profit growth on their own.But both products highlight the success of Amazon's long-term strategy; Alexa, in particular, may become a bigger point of the AMZN story in the future.Why Alexa And Echo Aren't A Big Deal For AMZN Stock YetFor any other company, Echo would be considered a monster hit. Amazon hasn't broken out sales figures, but it did say in December that it had sold""millions""of Echo devices. An outside firm pegged the numberat over 5 million. With the average sales price for Amazon likely around $100 (including retail markup and sales of lower-priced Amazon Dots), that implies as muchas half a billion dollarsin sales for AMZN.10 Dangerous Dividend Stocks to Dump NowThat's a huge number - for anyone but Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN generated more than $135 billion in revenue in 2016, meaning Echo-related sales were likely a fraction of 1% of the overall total. Those sales almost certainly come at higher margins for Amazon than, say, shipping a book at the company's usually tiny markup. But from a profit standpoint, Echo seems likely to offer at most a 1%-2% boost, and thus little impact on the fair value of AMZN stock at the moment.Meanwhile, the long-term prospects for Echo aren't completely clear. Usagetends to diminish over time(a trend certainly seen in my household). Echo isn't necessarily being used as a shopping device, either. Rather, the predominant uses are to set a timer, play music, and listen to news summaries.All told, while I do think there's a strong bull case for AMZN stock, that bull case isn't necessarily predicated on Echo. I wouldn't expect that by the end of the decade, consumers across America are ordering Bounty paper towels via drone through Alexa.But that doesn't mean Alexa doesn't matter for Amazon stock.Why Alexa (In Particular) Could Be A Big Deal For AMZN StockOf course, part of the genius of Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos is that Amazon's moves aren't based on the short-term. For all the complaints about AMZN stock's P/E ratio, the company almost certainly could cut costs substantially, and boost earnings, any time it wants.But Amazon continues to play the long game. It continues to expand its addressable markets, taking chances on major successes. (AWS remains the most obvious case of how that strategy has played out well.)From that standpoint, Echo and Alexa are off to a strong early start.Ditch Bank of America Corp (BAC) Stock and Look for Greener PasturesAdmittedly, direct Echo revenues are a tiny fraction of overall sales, and Echo-directed e-commerce revenue appears small. But Amazon still benefits from both products. For one, Alexa gives the company a toehold in the important artificial intelligence (AI) space. It allows Amazon to take onApple Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AAPL) Siri as well asAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL). Google Home sits in second place at the moment.For Alexa, in particular, the opportunities go beyond Echo. Alexa appears in Amazon Tap and the company's Fire Stick. Amazon wisely has opened the platform to third-party developers. They have created thousands of so-called ""skills,"" which create a virtuous cycle. The more skills there are, the more valuable Alexa is. The more valuable Alexa becomes, the more skills are created. And the more consumers fall in love with the product.Where Alexa Goes From HereThat opens the door to the real potential value in Alexa.Alexa isn't about driving e-commerce sales through Echo. It's about creating the dominant AI framework in the world. Alexa can be used in automobiles, to allow for safer multi-tasking. There are endless potential industrial applications. Because AMZN wisely has opened that system, it's far more likely to see those applications than Siri or Google's AI.That'sthe value in Alexa: its possibilities seem almost endless at the moment. To be sure, that doesn't mean Amazon necessarily will make billions of dollars off Alexa in two years, or in twenty. That's not the point, however. The point is that Amazon.com continues to innovate, and continues to be an ever-increasing part of its consumers' daily lives. From there, the argument goes, the business end will take care of itself, as will AMZN stock.Certainly, it has worked so far.As of this writing, Vince Martin did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceiShares Nasdaq Biotechnology Index (ETF) (IBB) Is at a Crossroads5 Blue-Chip Stocks to Sell in MarchThe 7 Best ETFs for Market-Beating ReturnsThe postAlexa CAN Drive Amazon.com, Inc.

This Long-Term Trend Makes Facebook an Awesome Buy;3/7/2017;"If you want your marketing message to reach a broad audience,   there used to be no better option than national television   commercials. But the growth of digital platforms likeFacebook(NASDAQ: FB) andAlphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google make it easy to reach   hundreds of millions of people. What's more, you can target your   message so it only reaches the most qualified potential   buyers.That's why digital has been eating into television ad budgets   -- and why analysts expect that trend to continue for the   foreseeable future. eMarketer forecasts that digital advertising   spend in the U.S. will climb to $113 billion by 2020, while TV ad   spend grows much more slowly, reaching just $77 billion. Digital   spend just surpassed television last year.One of the biggest beneficiaries of the shift of ad budgets   from television to digital is Facebook.makeArticleAd();Image source: Facebook.A Super Bowl every dayFacebook COO Sheryl Sandberg once likened Facebook's reach to   the largest television event. ""We have a Super Bowl on mobile   every day,"" she said.And it's true. Facebook has 1.23 billion daily active users --   1.14 billion on mobile and 180 million in the U.S. and Canada.   The Super Bowl earlier this year attracted 111.3 million viewers   in the U.S.Granted the Super Bowl lasts something like five hours (more   if Tom Brady sends it into overtime). The average Facebook user   spends ""just"" 50 minutes per day across Facebook, Instagram, and   Messenger, the last of which doesn't yet show ads.However, the average American watches less television today   than they did a few years ago. View time across all age groups   fell 11% in the six years ending last fall. The trend is more   pronounced among younger people. People between 18 and 24 spent   35% less time watching traditional television during the second   quarter last year compared to the second quarter of 2010,   according to Nielsen.While Facebook isn't the only reason people are watching less   TV, it presents a very good option for advertisers looking to   replace that lost watch time.Facebook is taking a huge share of digital advertising   growthDigital advertising is growing rapidly, but that doesn't mean   all of that ad spend will go to Facebook. Nonetheless, Facebook   has done an excellent job winning those new ad dollars flowing   from television ad budgets to digital.In the third quarter last year, Facebook took 45% of all   digital advertising growth. Google managed to take 54% of   advertising growth, leaving just 1% of growth for everyone   else.Facebook is poised to continue capturing a lion's share of   digital ad spend growth in the future, too. Display advertising   is the largest form of digital advertising today, and eMarketer   expects that to remain the case in the future. Facebook holds a   wide lead in display advertising, bringing in around $12 billion   in the U.S. last year compared to less than $5 billion for   Google.Facebook is also working to attract more video content to its   platform, which fits nicely with the trend of shifting ad   budgets. Facebook is reportedly funding new content productions   for its platform in the hopes of seeding an entire ecosystem   similar to YouTube. YouTube has proven extremely lucrative for   Google, and Facebook wants in on the billions of digital video   adverting revenue it generates every year.Not only are ad budgets shifting from television to digital,   Facebook is one of the few companies that's been able to attract   those ad dollars thanks to its audience size, engagement, and ad   targeting capabilities. As the trend continues through the end of   the decade, that makes Facebook an awesome buy.10 stocks we like better than FacebookWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

YouTube TV Is Here: What Investors Need to Know;3/6/2017;"Image source: Getty Images.Americans are changing the way they watch television. More and   more customers are showing interest in over-the-top streaming TV   services. Over 200,000 people joinedAT&T's(NYSE: T) DirecTVNow in about one month.DISH Network's(NASDAQ: DISH) Sling TV has over 1 million subscribers.Sony's(NYSE: SNE) PlayStation Vue is also very popular.makeArticleAd();Now YouTube -- a subsidiary of Google, theAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) company -- is throwing its hat in   the ring as well. The company recently revealed YouTube TV, a   slightly differentiated television service that costs just $35   per month.Here's what investors need to know about YouTube TV.YouTube TV's channel lineup. Image source: YouTubeIt's missing a lot of traditional cable networksYouTube focused on signing deals with the big four broadcast   companies. As a result, cable-only media companies such asViacomandTime Warnerare missing from the bundle. No CNN, Comedy Central,   Cartoon Network, TBS, TNT, or HBO. But it does mean cable   networks owned by the big four -- ESPN, FX, USA, E!, and so on --   are all there.That's kind of the opposite approach of Sling TV. Sling   launched without any broadcast networks, inviting subscribers to   buy a television antenna to supplement the service.Importantly, local networks are limited in availability.   That's why YouTube TV is launching only in markets where the   media companies own the local broadcast affiliate. Sony tried   something similar before expanding nationwide with a reduced   price for subscribers where live local channels are not   available.Overall, the channel lineup is somewhat lacking compared with   competing services at around the same price point. Customers that   signed up early for DirecTV Now are receiving 100 channels for   $35 per month, and new customers can still receive 60 channels   for that price. PlayStation Vue customers can get a similar   set of channels for $35 per month, and Sling TV subscribers can   get around 50 channels for $40 per month.The limited geographical reach and channel lineup should   reduce the number of subscribers YouTube TV will attract.YouTube is a veteran at video streamingAlthough YouTube TV may lack some of the content available on   other platforms at similar price points and the geographic reach   of its competition, it has one major advantage. It already owns   leading technology in video streaming.All three of the aforementioned competitors suffered major   technical difficulties following their launches. DirecTV Now   received a lot of bad press as its servers were overloaded making   parts or all of the service unusable. YouTube, on the other hand,   already streaming 1 billion hours of video every day.Consumers may be willing to sacrifice some channels for more   reliable service. But YouTube still has to prove that it can   deliver where competitors failed.The bottom line for investorsYouTube TV is a somewhat underwhelming product at launch. With   a limited channel lineup and geographic reach, it's unlikely to   make any significant impact on YouTube's operations in the near   term.In the long term, however, getting a viable product out there   now could lead to a much better product in the future. YouTube is   already offering a few differentiating features such as unlimited   cloud DVR, AI powered search and personalization (likely backed   by YouTube viewer data), and the ability to split the account six   ways so different users get different recommendations. If YouTube   can get the content deals in place while maintaining competitive   pricing, it could be a big winner in the future.10 stocks we like better than Alphabet (C   shares)When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better     buys.Click hereto learn about these picks!*Stock Advisor returns as of February 6, 2017This podcast was recorded on March 2, 2017.Sean O'Reilly:Welcome toIndustry Focus, the podcast that dives into a different sector of the stock   market every day. Today is Thursday, March 2, 2017, so   we're talking about energy, materials, and   industrials. I am your host, Sean O'Reilly, and joining   me today via phone is Motley Fool senior auto   specialist, Mr. John Rosevear. Good morning, John!John Rosevear:Good morning, Sean! How are you, today?O'Reilly:Extremely well. It's good to hear your voice. It's been   awhile, a month or two, since we last had a podcast, and I   missed you, buddy.Rosevear:Yeah, it's been a few weeks.O'Reilly:I had to get you in here to answer an all-important question.Rosevear:What's the question?O'Reilly:You're the only guy I know who can answer this for   me. I hate driving, I live in D.C., it's very tiring, I   want to know when I'm going to get my self-driving car.Rosevear:Well, it depends on what you mean by get, and   really depends on what you mean by   self-driving, [laughs] unfortunately.O'Reilly:I'm not touching the wheel in my driveway.Rosevear:Let's back up and define some terms here. This system of   classification for things that assist drivers has become   pretty universal. It was developed by the Society of Automotive   Engineers in the U.S. The U.S. government has adopted   it, other governments have adopted it, it's the way all   automakers talk now. They categorize it in six levels that   are helpfully numbered from zero to five. A level zero system,   there's no automation, the driver does everything. This might   even include warning systems like lane departure warning. But,   the driver actually has to do everything. Level one is when   you get some basic level of driver   assistance, assistance that parallel parks for   you, that kind of stuff. That's a level one system.O'Reilly:Does that include anti-lock brakes? I'm surprised   that's on here.Rosevear:That's...O'Reilly:Eye of the beholder?Rosevear:The driver is still executing that. They count that as an   intervention system. It's when the car decides to break for you   that it starts to become assisted. These emergency   stopping systems that they have now where the radar is on   the front of the car, the levels one through five require some   level of sensing what's going on around a car. So, yeah, these   parallel park systems where the car spins the wheel for you and   backs into the spot, that kind of thing, that's a level one.   Level two is where it starts to get interesting. This is the   system where you're on the highway and the traffic jam assist   systems, maybe the earliest versions of Tesla's   autopilot, where you can kind of take your hand off the   wheel under certain circumstances, and the car will maintain and   adjust its speed relative to the cars around to you, and it   will keep itself in its lane. It's doing a little   steering and a little accelerating and decelerating on its   own. But there still has to be a human driver, the human   driver has to be ready to grab the wheel. In fact, a lot of   these systems require you to actually touch the wheel every   minute or two, or something like that. Level three is   when it kind of gets into self driving. This is a system that can   drive under certain conditions, we might say highway   driving, this is where Tesla's autopilot is starting to go,   this is where some of the systems,GM's(NYSE: GM) Super Cruise that will come out on Cadillac   soon, this is where it ends up, level three.O'Reilly:Super Cruise? [laughs]Rosevear:That's what they call it. That's what they've been   calling it for a few years, I'm not completely sure   that's what they're going to call it when it comes to   market. Anyway, the gist here is, it's self-driving until   suddenly it isn't, the driver has to be ready to grab the   wheel. That makes it a little tricky. We'll talk about that   in a minute.O'Reilly:The Motley Fool's Dan Sparks did that article about a year   ago, he lives out in Colorado and he has a Tesla, how   far did he get, 90 miles? I can't remember, but, I   don't think he touched the wheel on the freeway with that   thing.Rosevear:Tesla's official instructions with the original system where   you're supposed to touch the wheel regularly, they considered it   an advanced level two system. I think now they're into level   three territory. The border here is a little bit fuzzy. The   border to level four is not fuzzy. Level four is, the car is   driving itself, period. It does not need you, but it's   limited. Usually what it means is it's limited to an area   that's been mapped, we say it's been geofenced.   These systems tend to depend on very highly detailed 3D   maps that show stuff that normal maps don't show,   like exactly where the curb is within a couple inches and so   forth, so the car can navigate precisely, especially on   a city street. So, it's full self-driving, you don't ever   have to touch a steering wheel, but it only works where the   car has a map. Level five -- and we'll get back to this in a   minute -- is the full-blown thing. It'll drive itself   wherever you want under any conditions. If it's   snowing, it'll go up a mountain, whatever,   anything.So, what we're talking about in the near future is level   four, a car that will self-drive itself. This is coming soon. But   it's limited by its maps. The idea is, gradually the maps   will expand over time and you'll be able to drive --O'Reilly:Are there cities that are being mapped right now? I'm   actually surprised to hear this.Rosevear:Yeah, Pittsburgh is being mapped. This is where Uber is   doing their testing, a lot of it. This is actually where   Ford's new company they created as a start-up with a veteran of   Uber and a veteran of Google's self-driving car project running   it. This is basically Ford's software team for self-driving,   and they're in Pittsburgh. There's been a lot of mapping   done, interestingly, in Pittsburgh, because the   artificial intelligence lab at Carnegie Mellon is the   source of a lot of the research that went into this, so, a   lot of the people are there. There's some mapping going on   in San Francisco. I know GM's   cruise automation subsidiary is doing testing of level   four assistance in San Francisco, so they have mapping going   on. Then, there are companies mapping all over the place. Tesla,   I think, is automating some of this mapping with the sensors   on their existing cars. A company calledMobileye(NYSE: MBLY)  is going to start doing mapping with   sensors on their customers' cars, these are sensors for level two   systems but they can help do the mapping for level four. This is   going to start very soon, probably next year for Mobileye. There   are private companies trying to do this, too, hoping to   be able to sell the maps to the automakers or whoever. And, of   course, the big wild card in this is, of course, Waymo. Google's   been mapping for years and years. [laughs]O'Reilly:You've seen the cars? They look ridiculous, they have the   pole and they have the ball of cameras on the top, and they just   drive around all these cities. That's how I can see what   my dentist's office looks like from across the street.   They're mapping cities with that, too?Rosevear:Yeah. I think everybody is. And it's not just mapping for   Google Maps, it's mapping at a much more fine level of   detail, where is the curb, where is the speed bump, and so   forth, so the car knows what to expect as it's driving. The   idea is, a map is a fallback from its sensors. If it's dark   out, if it's foggy, if the lighter system is   being buggy for whatever reason, you can kind of fall   back on the maps. Because these are safety systems, there   has to be redundancy built in. That's the thinking.O'Reilly:So, when is this stuff coming out?Rosevear:Good question. Tesla constantly does these upgrades, and   they'll break into level four at some point. If I had to   guess, I'd say 2019. But I don't know for sure. They may not   even know absolutely for sure when they'll be ready to ship   it. There's also an interesting question there that with their   owners of their current models, they've been shipping stuff that   maybe has some bugs still in it for the owners to bang on.   And because Tesla owners tend to be early adopter types,   they're mostly cool with that. As Tesla moves into the mass   market with its upcoming Model 3, something else we've   talked about, I don't know if they're going to tighten it up   a little bit. They might. We'll see. But that might push   that data off. But, anyway, this partnership of giant   auto supplierDelphi, Mobileye, which is a machine vision specialist that   has done a lot of work around--O'Reilly:And but they are publicly traded, right? For our   listeners.Rosevear:They are. The ticker there is MBLY. Look them up, because if   you want a pure-play on self-driving, that's as close as it   gets. The third company in this isIntel, which is designing the processors. They're working   together on a level four system. We've talked about this   before. They will have this available to any automaker who wants   it by the end of 2019, they say. Now, the cars are going to   ship in 2019. These things are incorporated as the cars are   developed. So, probably late 2020, early 2021, people   will be shipping cars with this system in, but those cars   may not go to retail. [laughs]O'Reilly:What?! Will they hang out and not do anything? [laughs]Rosevear:Here's what, for instance, Ford is saying. Ford says,   ""We're going to mass produce a level four vehicle   starting in 2021."" Great. Then, they say, ""Yeah, but we're not   going to sell it at retail. This is going to be for car sharing   use in cities and ride hailing services, Lyft and Uber and so   on."" It's because of the maps. They only want to sell it   where they have the maps. CEO Mark Fields at Ford has said,   ""We're not even going to give it a steering wheel in this,""   so obviously it has to have the maps. Again, as the maps   expand, there'll be more. Ford is saying right now that they   think they'll have level four functionality in their retail   vehicles 2025-ish. But they always say that, Bill   Ford, executive chairman of Ford, always says, ""We throw out   these dates, but it's always earlier than I expect."" So,   we'll see. Right now they're saying 2025. So, yeah, he says,   ""This stuff moves much faster than we expect."" There's also   some other stuff going on. The thing to emphasize here, I   should back up a little bit, not all the automakers, not all the   tech companies talk about what they're doing. There will be   surprises here. This is just, what has been announced, what we   have seen, what we generally know is coming.O'Reilly:Yeah, once you go public with something you get held to   it in some capacity, and nobody wants to get egg on their   face.Rosevear:Right. And GM originally said they'd launch Super Cruise in   2016 --O'Reilly:They need to get a different name for   that. [laughs]Rosevear:Yeah, OK. They're a level three system. They came out a while   back and said, ""Wait a minute, we're not happy with it,   we're going to do more work and make it more advanced.   We're not going to set a firm date, but we think late   2017-18, probably around there."" But again, they are   not holding themselves to a firm date on that. In fact,   they're not holding themselves to a firm date on a lot of   this stuff. Mary Barra's thing is, ""We'll ship it when it's   ready."" But what we do know is that GM is planning to   actually start building a whole lot of level four vehicles,   reportedly in the thousands. These will be the electric Chevy   Volts. They will be fitted with prototype level   four systems, and they will go into this massive test   with Lyft in several different cities. So, when will   you get your level four car?O'Reilly:Which is why they invest in Lyft.Rosevear:Right. They own 9% of Lyft, it's something like that.   It's a major investment, certainly, for GM. But, when   do you get yourself a driving car? If you're in D.C., you   might get one in several months from now or a year from now, when   you summon Lyft with your smartphone and a Chevy Volt comes. Uber   is already doing this on a tiny scale in Pittsburgh. They   have 8 or 12 cars or something that are prototype   self-driving vehicles in their fleet. With these   things, there are two engineers on board. One is ready to   grab the wheel and the other one is taking notes on   everything that's happening with the system. And it may be   the same deal with these GM Lyft self-driving vehicles. So   it might not seem all that exciting because there's somebody   in the front seat, but the car is driving itself, is the   idea. This is a way to rack up a whole lot of test miles   quickly, if you have a whole bunch of these things out   there, you know?O'Reilly:Yeah. I can't wait to see all these Lyft driverless   cars handle all the roundabouts in D.C., that'll be a   treat.Rosevear:Yeah, they'll teach them. We call them rotaries up here in   New England, we have lots of them too. It'll be   interesting to see how they handle Boston, which is colonial   era streets in some areas of town. [laughs]O'Reilly:Yeah, they're made for horses, not driverless cars.Rosevear:Yeah. Well, they were made to walk in, or cow   paths, definitely not driverless cars. But, there's other   stuff in here, too. The wild card is Waymo, which is the   Alphabet subsidiary that used to be the Google Self-Driving   Car Project and has now been set up as a company to go into   business and commercialize this in some way. Who will   partner with them? They had this little deal with Fiat   Chrysler where Chrysler built them some Chrysler   Pacifica minivans as test vehicles that took on their   latest prototype system. They've been talking toHonda, reportedly. But of course, there's a certain view in the auto   industry that a deal with Waymo is a deal with the   devil because Google will want all the data. And then you're   an Android phone maker, and Google's making all the   money. That is a great fear. I think every auto CEO in the world   is mindful of the example of the phone   industry. [laughs] They don't want to give up the   data. I think that is actually a lot of the selling   proposition of the Delphi-Mobileye system, this is a system   developed within the established auto industry supplier   structure. We'll share the maps among our fellow automakers   and so forth, but we're not selling the data to   Google. [laughs]O'Reilly:What do you think has been going on there? Correct me if I'm   wrong, but Google has those tiny little white go-kart   looking driverless cars for years. The laymen, we haven't   gotten a hint of them trying to make a buck off of them   at all. It's weird.Rosevear:They hired, a while back, and executive named John Krafcik.   He had been the president ofTrueCar, and before that, he had been in the business for years. He   was with several automakers, in management   capacities, executive capacities. He's a guy who knows the   business, a good guy, smart guy. His job is to lead Waymo and   find a way to bring this stuff to market somehow. He's been out   there talking to automakers. He actually did a really big   presentation at the North American International Auto Show   in Detroit in January -- I was going to say last month,   but it's March now. He was talking about where their system   is and so forth. They have a solid prototype level four   system. I think he was there, in part, fishing for   automakers who might want to have conversation. It's   possible those conversations have happened and nobody   is talking about them. The ones that have made it into the   media are Honda and, of course, Fiat Chrysler, which is   a much more overt thing, because the latest test vehicles   are all Chryslers.O'Reilly:We don't have this as a note, so feel free to tell me   you don't know a ton about this, but I'm sure all of our   listeners are on the tip of their tongues with this, they   want to hear, what is Apple up to? They have that big   plan, and I've got a push notification fromThe Wall Street Journala year ago that Apple was going to build a car within   the decade, blah blah, then they pulled back on it, they're doing   testing again. What is Tim Cook scheming right now?Rosevear:Good question. Yeah, I remember when thatWall Street Journalthing came out.O'Reilly:You got the notification too, I'm sure.Rosevear:I did, and I actually poked a few sources and ended up   writing a big piece for The Motley Fool first thing on   Saturday morning after that broke, sort of, what does this   mean, can they actually do it, that kind of thing. And the   answer was, Apple has so much money that, of course, they   could start a car company, the question is, do they want   to?O'Reilly:Yeah, I remember you talking about that.Rosevear:Right. They can throw money at it. The full boat, it's about $10   billion to get to where Tesla is where they have a factory   and they're banging out cars and it's really high level of   quality and so forth. Full boat. That's Tim Cook's lunch   money these days. [laughs] Their cash load is   unbelievable. They can do anything. The question is, would   they want to? The margins in the car business, by   Apple's standards, are pretty lousy. A luxury car   business might make an operating margin of 10-12%. If   you're Porsche, you might make 16%. That's kind of the upper   limit.O'Reilly:So, is it possible that Google and Apple wind   up dropping the brains in these cars and calling it a day?   Google already, they must have tons of data on these cars   operating.Rosevear:Google has made it clear, John Krafcik came out and said,   ""We're not building cars, we're not going to build a   car factory, we are not building cars. We're looking for   partnerships, we are not building cars."" Apple hasn't said   anything, of course. Officially, this program doesn't even exist.   But the word was, a lot of the people who might have been on   the actual build-a-car side of the business have been let go.   People working on electric self-driving cars are in very hot   demand these days. So, none of these people are wanting for   employment. But it was thought that a lot of those folks   were let go, and they really ratcheted down the ambitions of   the program. They may be aiming to do something where they come   out, like Waymo, and offer a system that Apple-izes a self   driving car built by somebody else. It's possible that they   will find an automaker to partner with, and maybe offer that as a   deluxe ride hailing option. My thought when they were   originally talking about this was that they were going to build   the deluxe Apple version of robot Uber, where it's a little   bit more money but it's a nicer car, and it recognizes all   your Apple devices and it's this seamless experience, it sees   your iPhone and it automatically sets your seat and   your climate and your music and everything else and all this   stuff, it takes exactly where you want to go, and it's   just a subscription model, $500 a month for the Apple Car   service. That's where I thought they were going to go.   Others disagreed. Some of my fellow Fools who are also very close   watchers of this kind of technology and particularly   close watchers of Apple thought they might actually build a car   for retail Tesla-style.O'Reilly:Cool. We're about out of time, John. I want to give you   the last word. When am I magically going to get   my driverless car in my driveway?Rosevear:If you want a Tesla, you might get it by the end of the   decade. If you want a car from one of the bigger automakers,   it's probably a few years beyond that. Somebody may surprise   us and have a level four car out by 2020 or 2021 that has a   fairly big map. But I'm thinking it might be over the next   couple years after that that these start to be available for   retail. I suspect the first ones that come out, it will be an   expensive option on a luxury car.O'Reilly:Awesome. John, I cannot thank you enough, once again,   for your time.Rosevear:It's always a pleasure.O'Reilly:I have to imagine that as this continues to ramp   up, this will not be our last show about this topic.Rosevear:Oh, heavens no. We'll be talking about this for several   years to come. It's a big deal.O'Reilly:Awesome. Well, have a good day, John! Thank you,   again!Rosevear:All right. Take care, Sean!O'Reilly:Bye.

6 Things You Didn't Know About Baidu, Inc.;3/6/2017;"Many tech investors are probably familiar with the basic facts   aboutBaidu(NASDAQ: BIDU) -- it's the biggest search engine in China, it has   a growing ecosystem of cloud-based services likeAlphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google, and it benefited greatly   from Google's exit from the mainland Chinese market in 2010.Those are the bullet points in the growth story that boosted   Baidu stock by nearly 1,500% over the past decade. But today,   we'll take a look at six lesser-known facts about the ""Chinese   Google"" which many investors might have overlooked.Image source: Author's screenshot.makeArticleAd();1. CEO Robin Li cut his teeth in the U.S. tech     industryAfter earning a master's degree in Computer Science from the   University of Buffalo, Baidu co-founder and CEO Robin Li worked   at Dow Jones & Co.'s IDD Information Services and search   company Infoseek in the  1990s.At IDD, Li developed the software for the online version ofThe Wall Street Journaland invented his patented Rankdex site-scoring algorithm for    SEO rankings -- which currently powers Baidu's search   engine. At Infoseek, Li created the image search function, which   was subsequently used inDisney's Go.com network. After spending over five years at those two   companies, Li returned to China and co-founded Baidu with   investor Eric Xu in early 2000.2. Baidu is developing driverless carsLike Google, Baidu believes that autonomous electric cars   would be a natural extension of its data mining ecosystem. The   company started testing out driverless cars on public roads in   late 2015, and formed a driverless tech research center in   Silicon Valley last April.Image source: Getty Images.Baidu is powering these vehicles with a combination ofNVIDIA's automotive chips, HERE Maps, and its own AI algorithms. It's   currently outsourcing production of these vehicles to Chinese   automakers, and has declared that it will launch an autonomous   shuttle bus  by 2018.3. It's beefing up its AI effortsFor search engines like Baidu and Google, AI plays a key role   in recognizing images, analyzing search patterns, and deciding   what types of targeted ads will appeal to users. That's why Baidu   hired a lot of top talent in AI -- its chief scientist Andrew Ng   previously helmed the Google Brain AI project, and its new   augmented reality chief Qi Lu was previously an AI specialist atMicrosoft.Baidu hasn't been shy about challenging Google in the AI arms   race. In January, it pitted its AI program against Google's   AlphaGo AI in  a series of facial and voice recognition   tests in a live TV broadcast.4. Baidu owns a small stake in Didi ChuxingBaidu previously invested in Uber's Chinese division, but Uber   eventually retreated from the market due to tough competition --   especially from market leader Didi Chuxing. Uber sold its Chinese   business to Didi last August, but retained a 17.7% stake in the   new subsidiary. Baidu and Uber China's other  shareholders   received a 2.3% stake.That stake is small, but Baidu could boost it and more tightly   integrate Didi's services into its O2O (online-to-offline)   ecosystem. Didi could also play a key role in automating Baidu's   driverless cars.5. It owns a big part of CtripBaidu owns a 25% stake inCtrip(NASDAQ: CTRP) , the largest online travel agency (OTA) in China.   For years, Ctrip was engaged in a price war with its primary   competitorQunar(NASDAQ: QUNR) , which crushed both companies' margins.Baidu owned a 45% stake in Qunar, but it swapped that stake   for  a 25% stake in Ctrip in 2015 -- which effectively   merged the two companies and ended the price war. That move also   tethered Ctrip's services more tightly to Baidu's growing O2O   ecosystem.6. Baidu also sells smart bikesIn late 2014, Baidu introduced DuBike, a bike equipped with a   wide array of health and motion sensors which sync to a mobile   app. It also features on-board navigation signals, which let   riders follow directions without glancing at their phones, and   lets riders share their routes with friends. To top it off, the   entire system is powered by a rider's kinetic energy -- so the   bike never needs to be recharged.Baidu's DuBike. Image source: Baidu.The key takeawayThe heart of Baidu's business is still search-based   advertising, but that could gradually change as its efforts in   driverless cars, AI, its O2O ecosystem, and even smart bikes pay   off. Therefore, investors should keep an eye on these adjacent   efforts as the company trades blows with other tech titans --   likeTencentandAlibaba-- over the next few years.10 stocks we like better than BaiduWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

GoPro Inc (GPRO) Stock Gutted? Time to Go Long!;3/6/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsGoPro Inc(NASDAQ:GPRO) is a camera company, yet Wall Street experts expected so much more out the GPRO story. They even once labeled it as ""a YouTube killer."" I betAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) management wasn't too worried then. That exuberance marked the top for GoPro stock.makeArticleAd();Source:ETC-USC via Flickr (Modified)Now, GoPro stock gets a downgrade under $9 per share. I'm sure it's no coincidence that this coincides with the IPO ofSnap Inc(NYSE:SNAP), which had a successful offering last week. Money is probably flocking out of GPRO and into SNAP stock, perhaps to recoup some losses there.I think the two have little in common. GoPro stock is a play on a line of action cameras known for being rugged and for active outdoorsy people. We see videos of extreme base jumping pros to teens clearing a two-foot hedge in their front yard. So far, SNAP appears to capture more general scenarios.The hate for GoPro stock should abate eventually. It still has cool products with very few high-profile direct competitors. I don't have a lot of faith in management, but just like in the case ofTwitter Inc(NYSE:TWTR), I think someone will eventually figure the stock out. But for this morning, GPRO stock is down 7.8% on a downgrade from Goldman Sachs.Click to EnlargeBased on that logic, I want to risk a little on a speculative trade going long GPRO stock. I could risk $8 to buy the stock, but instead I will use the options markets to risk even less. My thesis relies on GoPro stock eventually becoming attractive to old fans who revalue their re-entry levels.I do have to note that GPRO is in danger of inviting more technical sellers if it loses these lows. So I will snipe out the entry, perhaps in two tranches.The Bet:Sell the GPRO Jan 2018 $5/$3 credit put spread. This is a bullish trade for which I collect 50 cents to open per contract. If successful, this trade would yield over 30% on money risked. I need GPRO stock to stay above my sold spread to win.Yes, it is a gamble to try and catch falling knives, especially one like GPRO. But I need to add a few speculative plays to my portfolio, and this one qualifies. Again, an underlying assumption is that GoPro will eventually survive. But I don't need it to thrive to profit.Usually, I like to balance my risk by selling upside risk. In this case, however, I won't. GoPro stock has fallen too far, too fast, and I would be selling risk at a severe discount. If GPRO bounced hard, I would face self-inflicted risk against my own thesis.Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Is the New Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN)I could juice my bet by buying upside calls, but I will wait out a few more trading hours to flush out an interim bottom. I don't want to turn this trade into an investment yet, however, since I've already said that I don't have much faith in GPRO management's ability.I am not required to hold my options trade option through their expiration. I can close them at any time for partial gains or losses.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director ofSellSpreads.com.

Top Research Reports for March 6, 2017;3/6/2017;"makeZacksArticleAd();Monday, March 6, 2017Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Schlumberger (SLB).Johnson & Johnsonhave gained +15.8% over the last year, widely outperforming the large-cap pharma space (up +6.6%). J&J reported mixed fourth-quarter results, beating on earnings but missing on sales. However, the 2017 sales outlook was disappointing due to an expected slowdown in Pharma sales as a number of key growth drivers like Remicade and Concerta are facing competition.While the company is faced with a number of headwinds like unfavorable currency movements, increased competition from generics, pricing pressures and an uncertain global macroeconomic backdrop, the analyst believes that JNJ's diversified business model, deep product pipeline, lack of cyclicality and financial strength position it for continued momentum going forward. (You canread the full research report onJohnson & Johnsonhere.)Alphabet's shares have lagged the Zacks Tech sector marginally over the past year gaining +19% vs. +19.7%, with the company's weaker than expected Q4 earnings report only adding to its underperformance. These headwinds aside, the Zacks analyst points out the company's good execution to date, more or less maintaining its dominant share in a competitive, fast-growing search market.The company's focus on innovation, strategic acquisitions and Android OS should continue to generate strong cash flows. However, the promise of Google's non-search businesses continue getting pushed into future even as the company's spending keeps rising. On Feb 23, 2017, Alphabet Inc.'s Waymo sued Uber and its subsidiary Otto, alleging intellectual property theft and patent violation. (You canread the full research report on Alphabet here.)Schlumberger's shares underperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas Field Services industry over the last one year, gaining +6.4% vs. the sector's +16% increase. The Zacks analyst likes the continuous and effective cost-management initiatives of the company. The Schlumberger-Cameron merger will support technology-driven growth, going forward. The company's focus on international markets also deserves appreciation. Schlumberger's current dividend yield of 2.5% has outpaced both 1.9% yield for its broader sector and the 1.4% yield for rival, Halliburton Company.However, commodity price volatility remains an overhang on the stock. Additionally, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter 2017 earnings has been revised downward over the last 60 days.

Its robust Q4 results and expansion efforts notwithstanding, supply issues remain a concern.New UpgradesEni (E) Q4 Earnings Better Estimates, Revenues Grow Y/YThe Zacks analyst thinks higher gas sales and oil price realization helped Eni to better earnings estimates.

IBM to Commercialize Quantum Computing Using Cloud Platform;3/6/2017;"International Business Machines CorporationIBMrecently announced plans to introduce quantum computing systems and services in the commercial space under the brand name ""IBM Q"". The company will leverage its IBM Cloud platform to deliver these systems and services.We note that this is an industry-first initiative undertaken by the technology giant and could revolutionize the way computing is being carried out in the present context.International Business Machines Corporation Price and   ConsensusInternational Business Machines Corporation Price   and Consensus|International Business Machines Corporation QuoteFilling in the Market GapCognitive systems such as IBM Watson run on classical computers and are capable of finding patterns and insights by deciphering huge amount of data. However, in the absence of any such recognizable patterns, these systems are not of much use.This is where quantum computers come into play as they are capable of providing solutions to problems where recognizable patterns don't exist.Quantum computing has its applications in many fields such as artificial intelligence, financial services, cloud security, drug discovery and supply chain and logistics.What Does This Mean for IBM?As per a Market Research Media report, worldwide spending on quantum computing is estimated to reach $5 billion by 2020. Not surprisingly then, competition in the sector is intensifying, with the presence of major players such as MicrosoftMSFT, GoogleGOOGL, Intel, D-Wave Systems, Hewlett Packard and Lockheed Martin.However, IBM with its industry-first initiatives looks poised to carve a niche in this segment.Stock Performance OverviewShares of IBM have underperformed the ZacksComputer - Integrated Systemsindustry over the last one year. While the industry gained 33.8%, the stock appreciated 28.4%.The underperformance of the stock could be due to weakness in the company's traditional businesses and shift toward the cloud that is keeping margins under pressure.  However, we believe that IBM's endeavor in the rapidly growing quantum computing field along with its strategic initiatives will help the stock rebound in 2017.Zacks Rank and Key PickAt present, IBM carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the broader technology space is Digi International Inc.DGII, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights: Amazon, Google, Facebook  and Apple;3/6/2017;"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL -March 06, 2017 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog includeAmazon.com Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN-Free Report),Google(NASDAQ:GOOGL-Free Report),Facebook(NASDAQ:FB-Free Report) andApple(NASDAQ:AAPL-Free Report).Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations.Get #1Stock of the Day pick for free.Here are highlights from Friday's Analyst Blog:Amazon to Install Solar Panels to Power DatacentersThe world is fast shifting to alternative energy and this is spurring demand for solar panels.E-commerce giantAmazon.com Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN-Free Report) is gearing up for its next project associated with renewable energy initiatives. This time, the firm will harness solar energy by installing solar panels on the roof of its fulfillment facilities across the world.Coming to the price performance, over the past year, shares of Amazon outperformed the Zacks categorized Electronic Commerce industry. While the industry gained 39.53%, the stock returned 45.91%.DetailsAs part of its commitment to advance green power, Amazon has plans of deploying large-scale solar systems on rooftops of more than 15 fulfillment and sortation centers in the U.S. this year. By 2020, around 50 data centers are expected to use solar energy to meet their power needs.Amazon said that these solar panels could generate up to 80% of the annual energy requirements of a fulfillment center depending on the project, time of year and other factors. The company already has a network of wind and solar farms in Indiana, North Carolina, Ohio and Virginia. Its largest wind farm is in Texas.Amazon's senior vice president of Worldwide Operations, Dave Clark, said ""As our fulfillment network continues to expand, we want to help generate more renewable energy at both existing and new facilities around the world in partnership with community and business leaders.""Focus on Carbon NeutralityThis initiative by Amazon is the latest in a string of clean energy investments made by U.S. technology giants in recent months. For quite some time, Amazon has been moving away from fossil fuels and focusing more on clean energy. It aims at reducing its carbon footprint and using more renewable energy to power its huge data centers. Moreover, the company can generate healthy returns from these solar and wind investments as there are many associated tax incentives.Infact many corporate behemoths including Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL-Free Report), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB-Free Report) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL-Free Report) are progressively moving toward alternative energy sources to lower their overall carbon emissions and cut their energy bills substantially.Also, several countries are increasingly relying on solar power to generate clean energy. Stringent environmental legislations on greenhouse gas emissions have also proved to be a boon for the solar power sector. Moreover, despite high initial investments, low operational costs and no fuel costs make these solar investments attractive.Amazon.com, Inc. Price and Consensus|Amazon.com, Inc.

This Odd Little Company Beat the Market in 2016. Is It worth a Look in 2017?;3/6/2017;"It's tough to know what to make ofRaven Industries(NASDAQ: RAVN) . This unique little company's stock jumped 62.7%   in 2016, handily beating larger peers like3M(NYSE: MMM) , as well as the S&P 500. But companies that defy   description can sometimes be hidden buys.If it's tough to describe Raven, it's even tougher to figure   out where the company -- not to mention its stock -- is likely to   head in 2017. That's partly due to a huge issue with the company   that should worry investors who are interested in buying   top-quality stocks.Raven Industries invented the modern hot air balloon. Image     source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();What it doesRaven Industries was formed in 1956, when a group of   businessmen leftGeneral Mills, of all places, to form an industrial balloon company. Over   the next few decades, Raven invented the modern hot air balloon   and dabbled in other materials science industries like fiberglass   tanks, parachutes, cold-weather sportswear, and utility truck   bodies. The company branched out into the businesses of flow   systems and agricultural control systems in the 80s and 90s.Today, Raven still manufactures balloons, covers, liners, and   films used in various applications from grain covers to   wastewater pit liners to industrial packaging. It also has robust   agricultural controls and radar technologies businesses. The   ""internet balloons"" developed byAlphabet's Google to bring broadband access to rural areas utilize   Raven's balloon technology.Even with its 2016 performance, Raven is still a small   company, with a less than $1 billion market cap. So, let's look   at how such a small-yet-diversified company managed to crush the   market last year.The Trump factorAs you might expect with a small-cap company, Raven's growth   was very lumpy throughout 2016, in sharp contrast to the much   larger 3M and the S&P:RAVNdata byYCharts.But as you can see, one of the biggest jumps of the year for   the company came, unsurprisingly, in the wake of Donald Trump's   upset win in the November election. Such a win was seen as a boon   forconstruction companiesbecause of a potential major infrastructure package, fordefense contractorsbecause of potential increases in military spending, and forenergy companiesbecause of the potential removal of environmental   regulations.Raven Industries operates in all of those fields,   manufacturing films for the construction industry, surveillance   balloons and equipment for the military, and films to contain   fracking waste. No wonder the market has high hopes for the   company going into 2017.Of course, considering the amount of opposition on Capitol   Hill to some of President Trump's policies and proposals, it   would be a risky bet to buy Raven's stock solely on speculation   about his agenda without more details about how it might be   implemented -- and whether Congress is buying in to his   proposals. But there's an even bigger risk for potential Raven   investors.The red flagRaven is in an unusual situation in that, as of early   February, it was in non-compliance with NASDAQ rules for failure   to submit quarterly reports to the SEC. Since then, the company   has filed five quarterly SEC reports, including amended Q3 2016   and full-year 2016 reports, as well as an amended Q1 2017 report   and Q2 and Q3 reports.The company hadn't held an earnings conference call since   March 2016, but it finally held one on February 16th. On   that call, as you can imagine, there was a heaping helping of   humble pie served up by CEO Dan Rhykus. ""I'd like to address our   reevaluation of our internal control framework and the controlled   deficiencies we identified,"" he began, before stating the   following:We are responding with the utmost urgency and diligence to     remedy the situation and to ensure that we maintain a more     proactive approach to adapting the changes in the future, so     that our framework design appropriate adapts to whatever     changes our business may experience in the future or to changes     in the regulatory environment. As we work to remediate     these material weaknesses and enhance our control's framework,     we will keep you fully informed and updated.Essentially, management discovered that ""The  Company's    controls  relating  to  the response    to  the  risks  of  material    misstatement  were  not  effectively    designed,"" according to the company's amended 2016 10-K.   Specifically, these control issues could -- and did -- lead the   company to misstate items including goodwill, long-lived assets,   income taxes, and inventories on its quarterly and annual   reports.While many of these misstatements were comparatively small --   selling, general, and administrative expenses, for example, were   revised upwards by just $20,000 for FY 2016 -- some were far more   significant. Long-lived asset impairment losses of $3.8 million,   for example, weren't even included in the original 2016 10-K, and   contributed to a $6.7 million drop in EBIT on the amended report.   That in turn helped to drop annual EPS from $0.23 (original) to   $0.13 (restated), a major change.What's of more concern than these identified issues, however,   is the possibility that there are other problems that haven't yet   come to light.Investor takeawayThere's certainly a case to be made that -- with its reporting   now up-to-date and with remediation efforts under way -- Raven's   troubles are behind it, and it's a safe investment moving   forward. Plus, the company's reported third-quarter earningswere actually pretty impressive. Operating income was up 175% year over year, for   example. So maybe I'm being overly cautious when I say that   I don't feel comfortable investing in Raven until it can provide   concrete assurances that it has its house in order (remember, the   company hasn't yet been able to guarantee the issues are   solved).In the third-quarter earnings call, Rhykus has promised to   keep investors updated, so I'll be eagerly awaiting those   updates. In the meantime, there are plenty of other companies   that aregenerating strong earningsthat don't seem to be having the internal problems that Raven is   having. If you're interested in materials science stocks, you   could consider 3M,despite its middling outlook. For now, though, cautious investors should probably look   elsewhere.10 stocks we like better than Raven IndustriesWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Apple Inc. (AAPL) Apple Music Just Can’t Catch Spotify;3/4/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsApple Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AAPL) Apple Music is a success by all counts, but one target still remains elusive.makeArticleAd();Despite impressive subscriber gains since its 2015 launch, AAPL's streaming music service has been unable to catch primary rivalSpotify. And in the latest sign that the competition is far from over, Spotify just announced it has hit the 50 million paid subscriber mark.Spotify Hits 50 Million Paid SubscribersApple Music and Spotify are considered to be the two big players in the streaming music war.Spotify launched in 2008, giving it a long lead in which to build up steam over Apple Music, which didn't go live until 2015. Despite that head start - and predictions that after its initial free three-month trial expired, Apple's streaming music service would see a big drop off of subscribers - Apple Music quickly began to gain obliterate Spotify's numbers.Apple Music hit 10 million paid subscribers after just six months,a milestone that took Spotify nearly six years to reach. Since then,Apple Music has continued to add paid subscribers at a rapid pace: 11 million by last February, 13 million in April, 17 million in September and 20 million in December.Apple Inc. (AAPL) Posts Best Q4 Apple Watch Sales EverHowever, despite the rapidly increasing popularity of Apple's streaming music service, Spotify stubbornly refuses to go away. In fact, rather than stalling or beginning to slip as many expected, Spotify's numbers have also been growing strongly.Spotify had roughly 20 million paid subscribers at the time Apple Music launched. This week, the company announced it hashit 50 million.In other words, Spotify is not going anywhere any time soon.A Little More CompetitionWhile the big streaming music battle has been between Apple Music and Spotify, many other competitors are duking it out for the dollars of music fans. And rather than scare off new entrants, the success of Apple Music led to a big new competitor taking a shot at the business.Amazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN)launched Amazon Music Unlimited last fall, matching Apple Music's basic subscription rates. But Amazon added a twist by discounting the service for Amazon Prime members and slashing it it less than half the regular $9.99 monthly fee for owners of its Amazon Echo smart speaker.Will Apple Music Ever Catch Spotify? (And Does It Need to?)The success of Apple Music isn't just about bragging rights.The streaming music service is part of Apple's Services division. That division is increasingly important to the bottom line. It provides recurring revenue, which helps to protect against shocks when hardware sales hit rough patches. In AAPL's most recent quarter, Services posted thestrongest year-over-year growth of any of Apple's divisions.2016 revenue numbers for Spotify aren't yet available, but the music streaming service has consistently lost money, including $176.9 million in 2014 and $188.7 million. Thesituation looked grim a year ago, with Apple Music growing rapidly. However, big increases in paid subscriber drove a revenue gain of80% to $2.12 billion. That marked a turning point in the outlook for Spotify's survival.With profitability a distinct possibility in 2017, Spotify could be in acquisition territory.Alphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL) andFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) have both been floated aspotential buyers. An initial public offering could also be in its future.Apple Inc. (AAPL) iPhone 8 Lightning Port Drama ContinuesRegardless, Apple Music seems unlikely to knock Spotify off the top of the streaming music charts, at least not in the near future.That doesn't mean Apple Music isn't a success. It quickly vaulted from zero to a contender for top spot in mere months and has continued to grow. As shown by the number of streaming music services that continue to attract paid subscribers, there is still plenty of room for multiple big players to make money.Apple Music will continue to drive revenue into AAPL's Services division, even if that coveted No. 1 spot remains elusive.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceFriday Apple Rumors: iPhone Delay, Qualcomm Lawsuit and iOS FeatureApple Inc.

Believe It or Not, Apple Came in Dead Last in Customer Loyalty in This $24 Billion Market;3/3/2017;"Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) knows what it's doing. The company is a market   leader in many fields, and would often rather abandon a product   category rather than struggle on as a minor competitor to bigger   and better rivals.But even mighty Apple does the occasional swing-and-a-miss   routine. And some of Cupertino's whiffs come in vibrant   billion-dollar markets.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();Apple ranks dead last in the $24 billion file-hosting   marketBrand Keysis a branding consultancy firm with more than three decades of   expertise-building history under its belt. The firm is best known   for its Customer Loyalty Engagement Index (CLEI) rankings, where   a proprietary data-collection process builds customer-loyalty   ratings in more than 80 specific product categories.Apple, of course, dominates several of the latest Brand Keysratings. The iPhone shows up all comers in the smartphone category, no   tablet can beat the iPad's consumer loyalty, and MacBooks walks   away with the top rating among laptop brands. In something of an   upset,Apple Musiceven takes home the online music segment.And then there's the file-storage category. There, Apple   doesn't just miss the top spot, but falls all the way to the   bottom of 13 ranked services.How bad is that result for Apple?To be clear, Brand Keys claims that its measurements translate   directly into future sales prospects and revenues. According to   independent metrics fromMarkets and Markets, cloud storage is a $24 billion market today -- and expected to   reach annual sales of $75 billion in just five years.In other words, it looks like Apple is leaving a lot of cash   on the table. The iCloud file-storage service is not pulling its   weight, or moving the needle for Apple. Instead, consumers with a   need for off-site file-storage tools prefer free services like   Brand Keys' category winner, Sabrecat -- or a plethora of   better-known options such as runner-up Dropbox, or third-place   finisherGoogle(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Drive.Apple is not only missing a significant market opportunity,   but leaving a lot of that cash for Google parent Alphabet to grab   instead.Apple CEO Tim Cook. Image source: Apple.Why is Apple missing the boat?Apple's iCloud is, in many ways, very similar to Google Drive   and Dropbox. All three services allow users to store nearly any   type of file in a centrally managed cloud server, accessible from   any networked computer. They all come with small storage limits   for a free account, all offer a terabyte of storage for $9.99 per   month, and come with various tools for managing your stored   files. But Apple does a few things differently.First and foremost, the easiest way to access iCloud content   is via an iPhone, iPad, or MacBook. In fact, signing up for an   iCloud account is part of the setup process for all of these   systems. Then, the service is integrated into your Apple   experience as the destination for system backup files, the   default storage location for files created in the iWork office   suite, and an option for storing user files in newer versions of   the macOS system.All of this is designed to keep users tightly bound to Apple's   multi-device ecosystem. Once you're in, it's not easy to get   untangled. Given Apple's massive market reach, especially in the   tablet and smartphone segments, this alone should make iCloud a   winner. Apple CEO Tim Cook introduced the package as ""a strategy   for the next decade"" in 2012.However, Apple never quite delivered on that grand ambition.   iCloud is reportedly ostracized by other working groups within   the company, starved of resources, and mostly seen as a necessary   evil. Apple is a product company, and iCloud is not a marketable   product on its own -- at least not in its current Apple-centric   form. So, this odd piece of infrastructure machinery is left out   in the cold.And there goes Apple's ticket to a $24 billion industry that's   also on a rapid growth tear.Google sure is building its Drive product into everything from   Gmail to mobile photo storage to storage space for corporate   accounts. Dropbox is doing the same, while on the lookout for   another buyout bid. And this market should only grow faster as   theInternet of Thingsgrows up, requiring acres of cloud-based storage space. These   companies treat online file storage as an important business,   valuable on its own merits.Apple doesn't. Hence, the company is holding back on promoting   iCloud, developing it further, or building it into other   products, when appropriate. Cupertino misses out on a major   growth story, with absolutely no loyalty from the customers who   do sign up.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Cisco (CSCO) Expands Its IoT Offerings Thanks to Jasper;3/3/2017;"Cisco Systems Inc.'sCSCOstock has been a consistent performer in the last 12 months. While the ZacksComputer - Networkingindustry gained 27.6%, shares of this technology giant recorded marginally better returns of 27.7%. This trend can primarily be attributed to improving revenues from subscription services as well as robust demand in the telecom sector.Meanwhile, the company is focusing on expanding its Internet of Things (IoT) division, as per a recent announcement at the Mobile World Congress (MWC), held in Barcelona.Based on its acquisition of Jasper Technologies in Mar 2016 Cisco is aiming at becoming a major IoT platform provider going forward.Notably, the platform has emerged as one of the biggest monetization assets for Cisco given the burgeoning demand for IoT.At MWC, Cisco announced that itwill now provide support for narrowband IoT low-power wide-area network (LPWAN), which has applications in the industrial IoT space. Moreover, the company inked a partnership with car-maker Honda and Bright Box, a European connected-car platform which will enable Jasper to breath life into Bright Box's infotainment centers that come as a standard fitting in many of Honda's European car models. It was also announced at the event that Cisco will collaborate with Samsung and Jupl (a health data startup) to develop a wearable device targeted at the elderly for health monitoring purposes.What Does this Mean for Cisco?As of today, on the verge of one year completion, Cisco's IoT unit has witnessed a whopping surge of 157% in enterprise customer additions, 135% increase in the number of devices that are being managed and a 42% advance in adoptions for Jasper's Control Center product.As per an IDC report, the IoT market is estimated to reach a massive $1.7 trillion by 2020 with nearly 30 billion connected ""things."" Given the huge potential the sector has to offer, the time is ripe to carve a niche and that's exactly what Cisco is doing right now.Not surprisingly then, there is stiff competition in the space with the presence of major players such as Alphabet's GoogleGOOGL, MicrosoftMSFT, IBM, Intel, Siemens and AT&T.However, with these announcements, Cisco looks poised to take on the competition head on which augurs well for the company in the long run.Cisco Systems, Inc.

Despite Brief Jitters, Investors Still Favor Online Leaders And Infrastructure Plays;3/3/2017;"U.S. diversified stock mutual funds extended their rally in   February, picking up steam while tacking on 2.68% on average   after gaining 1.83% in January, according to Lipper Inc.That reflected gains by the broad stock market, measured by   the S&P 500, which advanced 3.97% last month after   notching a 1.90% gain in January. But market leadership rotated   back to more defensive sectors, reflecting growing caution among   investors.""The more-defensive stocks did well, while cyclical energy and   materials did not outperform,"" said Lew Piantedosi, who is lead   manager of seven Eaton Vance funds, totaling $3.9 billion in   assets. ""It was a complete reversal from the Q4 postelection   market rally, which was a cyclicals rally.""makeArticleAd();Sentiment flipped back in favor of growth-oriented cyclicals   after President Trump's address to Congress on the last night of   February.But the tilt earlier in February toward   cyclicals reflected investors' concern that Trump and the   Republican-majority Congress may have a harder time than   previously expected in implementing pro-growth policies.Q&A With Fidelity's Will DanoffReflecting the optimistic portion of February's market   performance, health/biotechnology funds led sectors last month,   gaining 6.72%.Among U.S. diversified stock fund categories, S&P 500   index funds led the way with a 3.87% gain.World equity funds lagged U.S. diversifieds, advancing just   1.90%, led by India region funds' 6.08% climb.Taxable bond fundseked out an 0.87% gain on average last month. Emerging markets   local currency funds outpaced other taxable categories, rising   1.94%.OutlookPiantedosi is guardedly bullish, going forward. ""The bull   market is in place until proven otherwise,"" he said. Many   investors and market observers have tried to call a market top.   But the economy keeps getting better, Piantedosi says. ""Corporate   earnings keep getting better, and earnings support the market,""   he added.The wild card that could derail the rally is the political   landscape, he warns.As long as the economy stays on track, Piantedosi likes the   shift to digital by advertising. ""That benefitsFacebook(FB) andAlphabet(GOOGL),"" he said. ""AndAmazon(AMZN) dominates online retail.""Another area he likes is biotech, which is producing a parade   of treatments for diseases. ""Celgene(CELG) is a leader within cancer treatments,"" he said. ""It has an   unbelievable pipeline. It is growing earnings north of 20%   annually and trades at a 17-times forward multiple, just below   the market multiple of 18.""IBD'S TAKE:Celgene is ranked No. 2 in IBD's Medical-Biomed/Biotech     industry group.See which biomed/biotech firm is No. 1, and check out its easy-to-understand fundamental and     technical data at IBD's Stock Checkup.In energy, he likes energy explorer and producerAnadarko Petroleum(APC) and field services providerHalliburton(HAL).He said, ""Anadarko is once again profitably growing   production, generating significant cash flow and is attractively   valued."" He added, ""Halliburton's exposure is mainly to   North American shale, and withoil   prices(steady) in the mid-50s, you're starting to see rig counts   increase. That increases the need for field services. They put   rigs together, service them, replace broken parts and so on.""He added, ""In consumer discretionary, it's hard to find good   names. But there'sAdvance Auto Parts(AAP). They're an auto parts retailer. That sector is less   susceptible to be Amazoned. Their business doesn't require a lot   of capital expenditure, so it's a good cash flow type of   business. And Advance got a new CEO three or four months   ago. He's a supply chain expert, which is what Advance   needs.""One key reason it is hard for investors to find consumer   discretionary that names they like is because so many big-box   retailers are getting kicked by online retailers, says James   Abate, chief investment officer of Centre Asset Management   and manager of its $125 million Select Equity (DHAMX). Add to   that the risk that many will be forced to cope with higher costs   stemming from the border adjustment tax - basically, a   value-added tax on imports - proposed by Trump, Abate says.Names in the sector that he does still like include media   companyCBS(CBS) and specialty food retailerWhole Foods Market(WFM).Sporting an OK 86 Composite Rating from IBD, CBS is trying to   clear a consolidation after a run-up that started in the   fall.Whole Foods has a very weak Composite Rating of 20 from IBD   and is trading at less than half its late 2013 high.The supermarket chain in January reinstalled co-founder John   Mackey as sole CEO.Also, the Trump push for infrastructure construction should   benefit a number of telecommunications and utility companies,   includingComcast(CMCSA) andVerizon(VZ), Abate says. Comcast has been running up since the election   and is near its all-time high.

Despite Brief Jitters, Investors Still Favor Online Leaders And Infrastructure Plays;3/3/2017;"U.S. diversified stock mutual funds extended their rally in February, picking up steam while tacking on 2.68% on average after gaining 1.83% in January, according to Lipper Inc.That reflected gains by the broad stock market, measured by the S&P 500, which advanced 3.97% last month after notching a 1.90% gain in January. But market leadership rotated back to more defensive sectors, reflecting growing caution among investors.makeArticleAd();""The more-defensive stocks did well, while cyclical energy and materials did not outperform,"" said Lew Piantedosi, who is lead manager of seven Eaton Vance funds, totaling $3.9 billion in assets. ""It was a complete reversal from the Q4 postelection market rally, which was a cyclicals rally.""Sentiment flipped back in favor of growth-oriented cyclicals after President Trump's address to Congress on the last night of February.But the tilt earlier in February toward cyclicals reflected investors' concern that Trump and the Republican-majority Congress may have a harder time than previously expected in implementing pro-growth policies.Q&A With Fidelity's Will DanoffReflecting the optimistic portion of February's market performance, health/biotechnology funds led sectors last month, gaining 6.72%.Among U.S. diversified stock fund categories, S&P 500 index funds led the way with a 3.87% gain.World equity funds lagged U.S. diversifieds, advancing just 1.90%, led by India region funds' 6.08% climb.Taxable bond fundseked out an 0.87% gain on average last month. Emerging markets local currency funds outpaced other taxable categories, rising 1.94%.OutlookPiantedosi is guardedly bullish, going forward. ""The bull market is in place until proven otherwise,"" he said. Many investors and market observers have tried to call a market top. But the economy keeps getting better, Piantedosi says. ""Corporate earnings keep getting better, and earnings support the market,"" he added.The wild card that could derail the rally is the political landscape, he warns.As long as the economy stays on track, Piantedosi likes the shift to digital by advertising. ""That benefitsFacebook(FB) andAlphabet(GOOGL),"" he said. ""AndAmazon(AMZN) dominates online retail.""Another area he likes is biotech, which is producing a parade of treatments for diseases. ""Celgene(CELG) is a leader within cancer treatments,"" he said. ""It has an unbelievable pipeline. It is growing earnings north of 20% annually and trades at a 17-times forward multiple, just below the market multiple of 18.""IBD'S TAKE:Celgene is ranked No. 2 in IBD's Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group.See which biomed/biotech firm is No. 1, and check out its easy-to-understand fundamental and technical data at IBD's Stock Checkup.In energy, he likes energy explorer and producerAnadarko Petroleum(APC) and field services providerHalliburton(HAL).He said, ""Anadarko is once again profitably growing production, generating significant cash flow and is attractively valued."" He added, ""Halliburton's exposure is mainly to North American shale, and withoil prices(steady) in the mid-50s, you're starting to see rig counts increase. That increases the need for field services. They put rigs together, service them, replace broken parts and so on.""He added, ""In consumer discretionary, it's hard to find good names. But there'sAdvance Auto Parts(AAP). They're an auto parts retailer. That sector is less susceptible to be Amazoned. Their business doesn't require a lot of capital expenditure, so it's a good cash flow type of business. And Advance got a new CEO three or four months ago. He's a supply chain expert, which is what Advance needs.""One key reason it is hard for investors to find consumer discretionary that names they like is because so many big-box retailers are getting kicked by online retailers, says James Abate, chief investment officer of Centre Asset Management and manager of its $125 million Select Equity (DHAMX). Add to that the risk that many will be forced to cope with higher costs stemming from the border adjustment tax - basically, a value-added tax on imports - proposed by Trump, Abate says.Names in the sector that he does still like include media companyCBS(CBS) and specialty food retailerWhole Foods Market(WFM).Sporting an OK 86 Composite Rating from IBD, CBS is trying to clear a consolidation after a run-up that started in the fall.Whole Foods has a very weak Composite Rating of 20 from IBD and is trading at less than half its late 2013 high.The supermarket chain in January reinstalled co-founder John Mackey as sole CEO.Also, the Trump push for infrastructure construction should benefit a number of telecommunications and utility companies, includingComcast(CMCSA) andVerizon(VZ), Abate says. Comcast has been running up since the election and is near its all-time high. Verizon, range-bound between 57 and 46 since July, is trading near 49, 12% below its 52-week high.Flow-control systems manufacturerParker-Hannifin(PH) also stands to gain from infrastructure spending.

Google’s Groundbreaking Oscar Nod Could Pave the Way for VR;3/3/2017;"Virtual reality (VR) is a technology that is still in the   early stages of adoption. While headsets are available, VR has   yet to gain wide acceptance due to the high cost of consoles and   equipment, and the lack of sufficient content. Additionally, the   technology is still largely unfamiliar to the majority of   consumers, who may have heard of VR but have yet to experience   it. All that may be beginning to change.Pearl is the first VR movie to be nominated for an Oscar.     Image source: Google.makeArticleAd();For the first time, a movie created specifically to be viewed   in VR was nominated for an Academy Award. Though the film didn't   win, it may act as a touchstone for consumers.Alphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google Spotlight Stories, a VR   storytelling venue, has for the last several years produced   360-degree and VR films in the form of animated shorts. This   allowed filmmakers to reimagine storytelling and for technicians   from Google's Advanced Technology and Projects group (ATAP) to   hone the nascent technology.Its Oscar-nominated short,Pearl, is centered on the life and times of a musical father and   daughter traveling the country in pursuit of stardom. The   animated scenes all take place from the point-of-view of a   passenger in the front seat of their car. The ground-breaking   film was directed by Patrick Osbourne who received an Oscar in   2015 for his work onWalt Disney's(NYSE: DIS)Feast, a short film about a man and his adopted dog, which debuted in   2014. This highlights a recent push by filmmakers and the movie   industry to embrace the technology.Meanwhile, legendary director Steven Spielberg is fronting a   new VR start-up, Dreamscape Immersive, which recently raised $11   million in funding from several Hollywood studios. Focusing on   location-based virtual reality, the company plans to open a VR   multiplex in Los Angeles later this year.This comes on the heels of a similar location-based offering   that is the result of apartnershipbetween Google andIMAX Corporation(NYSE: IMAX) . The companies joined forces to create a cinema   grade VR camera using Google's Jump platform which seamlessly   integrates 360-degree video into a panoramic view. Last month,   IMAX opened its pilot VR center in Los Angeles and based on its   early success, the company plans to open five additional test   locations by mid-year. This model incorporates original material,   as well as content that expands on big budget films, such as   Disney'sStar Warsseries,Lions Gate Entertainment Corp.'sJohn Wickmovies, andHasbro'sTransformersfranchise.Samsung Gear VR. Image source: Samsung.In another sign that VR is gaining a wider audienceNetflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) released apps for its leading streaming service   that will work with several commercially available headsets   including theFacebook's Oculus Rift,Samsung's Gear VR, and Google Daydream View.  The app features   a virtual living room where viewers can connect with the familiar   Netflix interface to select programs for viewing. Website   ScreenRant.com detaileda listof movies that lend themselves to VR, without being specific to   the technology. While Netflix is not providing any actual VR   content, this is an acknowledgement that the public may be ready   for more in the way of interacting with VR technology.VR is still in its infancy and it will be some time before it   gains widespread adoption. Hollywood is leading the charge with   location-based options that will supplement the home VR market.   This provides evidence that the technology is gaining ground, and   the tipping point may be closer than we imagine.10 stocks we like better than Alphabet (A     shares)When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Amazon.com, Inc.

AMZN stock closed Thursday at $848.91, up 13% year to date, while soaring 53% over the past year.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockBut, the recent outage of Amazon's web-based Simple Storage Service (S3), which disrupted websites, apps and smart devices across the country, shows the Seattle-based e-commerce giant isn't infallible, after all. But, don't hold your breath thinking this glitch will put a damper on AMZN stock.According to the company's statement, the outage impacting the S3 cloud services was due to human error. An issue in the S3 billing process was being debugged by members of the Amazon Simple Storage Service team. In an attempt to rectify the issue, which involved taking down a small number of servers, one of the engineers entered an incorrect keystroke.""An authorized S3 team member using an established playbook executed a command which was intended to remove a small number of servers for one of the S3 subsystems that is used by the S3 billing process,"" Amazon saidin a statement on its website. ""Unfortunately, one of the inputs to the command was entered incorrectly and a larger set of servers was removed than intended.""The servers that were mistakenly taken down supported two other S3 subsystems, which triggered a widespread outage impacting government services, news sites, the Securities and Exchange Commission, Business Insider, Quora and Slack and a host of other institutions considered significant to the internet infrastructure.7 Stocks That Will Hit All-Time Highs in 2017It remains to be seen whether this issue will cause Amazon to lose any customers to competing cloud platforms such as those offered byMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) orAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL). To its credit, however, Amazon didn't try to hide behind its mistake, saying Thursday it was making several changes to avoid the potential of similar problems in the future.""We want to apologize for the impact this event caused for our customers. While we are proud of our long track record of availability with Amazon S3, we know how critical this service is to our customers, their applications and end users, and their businesses."" Amazon said in its statement. ""We will do everything we can to learn from this event and use it to improve our availability even further.""Bottom Line for AMZN StockThough Amazon might lose some support in terms of AWS being touted as best-of-breed cloud, AMZN stock won't be affected, given the many growth tailwinds Amazon still has. For fiscal 2017, Amazon is expected to earn $7.25 per share on revenue of $165.2 billion, marking year-over-year increases of 48% and 21.5%, respectively.

Amazon to Install Solar Panels to Power Datacenters;3/3/2017;"The world is fast shifting to alternative energy and this is spurring demand for solar panels.E-commerce giantAmazon.com Inc.AMZNis gearing up for its next project associated with renewable energy initiatives. This time, the firm will harness solar energy by installing solar panels on the roof of its fulfillment facilities across the world.Coming to the price performance, over the past one year, shares of Amazon outperformed the Zacks categorized Electronic Commerce industry. While the industry gained 39.53%, the stock returned 45.91%.DetailsAs part of its commitment to advance green power, Amazon has plans of deploying large-scale solar systems on rooftops of more than 15 fulfillment and sortation centers in the U.S. this year. By 2020, around 50 data centers are expected to use solar energy to meet their power needs.Amazon said that these solar panels could generate up to 80% of the annual energy requirements of a fulfillment center depending on the project, time of year and other factors. The company already has a network of wind and solar farms in Indiana, North Carolina, Ohio and Virginia. Its largest wind farm is in Texas.Amazon's senior vice president of Worldwide Operations, Dave Clark, said ""As our fulfillment network continues to expand, we want to help generate more renewable energy at both existing and new facilities around the world in partnership with community and business leaders.""Focus on Carbon NeutralityThis initiative by Amazon is the latest in a string of clean energy investments made by U.S. technology giants in recent months. For quite some time, Amazon has been moving away from fossil fuels and focusing more on clean energy. It aims at reducing its carbon footprint and using more renewable energy to power its huge data centers. Moreover, the company can generate healthy returns from these solar and wind investments as there are many associated tax incentives.Infact many corporate behemoths including GoogleGOOGL, FacebookFBand AppleAAPLare progressively moving toward alternative energy sources to lower their overall carbon emissions and cut their energy bills substantially.Also, several countries are increasingly relying on solar power to generate clean energy. Stringent environmental legislations on greenhouse gas emissions have also proved to be a boon for the solar power sector. Moreover, despite high initial investments, low operational costs and no fuel costs make these solar investments attractive.Amazon.com, Inc. Price and ConsensusAmazon.com, Inc.

Marissa Mayer Faces Yahoo Board's Ire for Security Breaches;3/2/2017;"Yahoo! Inc.YHOOboard has penalized CEO Marissa Mayer, calling her negligent of the security breaches that led to theft of personal information of over 1 billion users.The board has decided not to pay Mayer her bonus and stock reward. She is otherwise eligible for an annual bonus of up to $2 million and annual stock reward of millions of dollars.In Sep 2016, Yahoo announced that at least 500 million users were affected by a late 2014 cyber-hacking incident led by a ""state-sponsored"" actor. The stolen information included people's names, birth dates, passwords, and, in some cases, answers to personal security questions.Yahoo yesterday stated that an independent internal investigation has revealed that an unnamed foreign government backed hacker was behind the 2014 cyber attack and Yahoo executives had ""failed to act sufficiently"" upon discovery of the incident.The report criticized Yahoo's legal department for failing to timely analyze and investigate the matter followed by sudden departure of General Counsel Ronald Bell. Bells resignation, effective Wednesday, might be an indication of worse things to come. Bell resigned without severance pay.Mayer is already under pressure from users, investors and analysts over late admittance of this data breach and yet delayed data breach news worsened things up.In Dec 2016, Yahoo announced a separate, even more massive breach of user data. The Internet company disclosed that more than one billion user accounts had been hacked in Aug 2013.Yahoo! Inc. Net Income (TTM)Yahoo! Inc. Net Income (TTM)|Yahoo! Inc. QuoteVerizon Gains, Altaba SuffersThe breaches, two of the largest in Internet history, have already cost Yahoo $350 million. Verizon will now buy Yahoo's core internet business at a discount of $350 million for $4.48 billion.The newly negotiated deal will also make Altaba, Yahoo's new name post acquisition, responsible for all costs stemming from shareholder lawsuits and a regulatory inquiry of Yahoo by the Securities and Exchange Commission. However, Verizon and Altaba will split costs from all other hack-related lawsuits and government investigations.A Lot at Stake for MayerLosing a bonus and annual stock reward won't move the needle much for Mayer as she is already a millionaire after serving as a top executive at AlphabetGOOGL, then called Google and Yahoo.What will matter is the loss of reputation at repeatedly failing to turn Yahoo around, facing investors' ire and finally being held responsible for negligence following two of the biggest cyber-attacks in history.Over the last one year, Yahoo stock has outperformed the ZacksInternet-Servicesindustry. It returned 40.6% compared with the industry's gain of 12.3%.Zacks Rank and Stock Price MovementCurrently Yahoo carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Alphabet Could Be Berkshire's Next Tech Buy;3/2/2017;"After loading up onApple(AAPL) shares, couldBerkshire Hathaway(NYSE:BRK.A) (NYSE:BRK.B) buyAlphabet Inc.(GOOG) (GOOGL) shares next? Alphabet has been bought aggressively by multiple famous gurus. Buffett and Munger have commented favorably on the company's competitive position several times. The latest Berkshire shareholder letter indicates Buffett is very knowledgeable about the technology space.The fact that so many value investors are buying Alphabet at current multiples indicate it is a great business at a fair price. It is not immediately obvious how popular the stock is because Alphabet trades an A and a C share class, which are treated as seperate companies by lists put together through automation. They are economically equivalent, however, and if you add them up, Alphabet is one of the highest-owned stocks among the great investors tracked by GuruFocus.Back in 2009,Warren Buffett(Trades,Portfolio) talked aboutIBM(IBM), Apple and Google:makeArticleAd();""The chances of being way wrong in IBM are probably less, at least for us, than the chances of being way wrong in Google or Apple. I just don't know how to value them.I would not be at all surprised to see them be worth a lot more money 10 years from now but I would not buy either one of them. I sure as hell wouldn't short them either.""In addition,Charlie Munger(Trades, Portfolio) said:""Google has a huge new moat. In fact, I've probably never seen such a wide moat.""Munger added it was also filled with sharks. It is impossible to assess a moat without understanding competitors and their chances to successfully assault a company's market share. In this case, Munger might have seen the potential early while Buffett remained unconvinced. Buffett has alluded to his biggest mistakes as acts of omission.Bill Gates, formerMicrosoft(MSFT) chairman and a good friend of Buffett, stepped down in 2014. Microsoft runs the only real competition to Google search. Gates stepping down may have freed Buffett to learn about that competitive landscape from him.In additon, Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin and Chairman Eric Schmidt traveled to Omaha to talk to Buffett when setting up the new Alphabet structure, which is molded after Berkshire.Shortly before the trip, they brought in CFO Ruth Porat, who understands the tech founders' goals for the company.Buffett included the following paragraphs in the 2017 shareholder letter, putting my spider senses on red alert:""In 2002, entrepreneur Mitch Kapor asserted that 'By 2029 no computer - or 'machine intelligence' - will have passed the Turing Test,' which deals with whether a computer can successfully impersonate a human being. Inventor Ray Kurzweil took the opposing view. Each backed up his opinion with $10,000. I don't know who will win this bet, but I will confidently wager that no computer will ever replicate Charlie.That same year, Craig Mundie of Microsoft asserted that pilotless planes would routinely fly passengers by 2030, while Eric Schmidt of Google argued otherwise. The stakes were $1,000 each. To ease any heartburn Eric might be experiencing from his outsized exposure, I recently offered to take a piece of his action. He promptly laid off $500 with me. (I like his assumption that I'll be around in 2030 to contribute my payment, should we lose.)""This paragraph shows Buffett has been studying the tech world very hard and is open to the possibility the Turing test will be cracked by 2029. He also must have looked into the dynamics of driverless or pilotless technology, note the recent investment into airlines, to take on a $500 bet. I do not think betting against Buffett is generally a profitable endeavour. What jumped out at me is, apparently, Alphabet's chairman and Buffett recently spoke again. They must have spoken for quite some time for the subject of this casual bet to come up.All these factors have led me to speculate on the potential of an Alphabet investment.The pieces are falling into place.Buffett has been studying tech intensely.Berkshire has made a 180 as far as tech investments go.Buffett and Munger view Alphabet as having an incredibly strong moat.Alphabet's valuation is at an attractive level given the interest from the value investing greats. Porat is a great addition to the executive suite ,covering up pre-existing weaknesses in the team.Google executives have met with Buffett on multiple occasions and Schmidt talked to him recently.The one thing I could see keeping Buffett from making an investment is his distaste for stock-based compensation. Alphabet continues to dole it out like it is candy on Halloween.I would go as far as to say it would greatly surprise me if we do not see Berkshire buying a stake in Alphabet in the next five years.Disclosure: Author owns none of these stocks.Start afree 7-day trial of Premium Membershipto GuruFocus.Premium MembersThis article first appeared onGuruFocus."

Does Alphabet's Self-Driving Car Lawsuit Spell Disaster for Uber?;3/2/2017;"Last week,Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL)  spinoff Waymo sued Uber for   stealing some of its key autonomous car technology. It doesn't   take a lawyer to know that things don't look good for Uber, but   does this spell disaster for the ride-sharing company's   self-driving dream? Here's what you need to know.The not-so-secret dirty detailsNow that this is in the rearview mirror, it's clear we   should've seen it coming. According to Alphabet, former Waymo   employee Anthony Levandowski illegally downloaded 14,000 ""highly   confidential and proprietary files""  in December 2015 that   detailed the secret software and hardware designs   for Waymo's LIDAR system. LIDAR systems are being developed   as the ""eyes"" of most companies' attempts at autonomous vehicles,   allowing them to ""see"" the world around them via millions of   low-power laser beams blasted out every second. In January   2016,  Levandowski started his own self-driving company in   and, two weeks later , resigned without notice from Waymo.   In August 2016, he sold his company to Uber for $680 million.IMAGE SOURCE: ALPHABET (WAYMO)makeArticleAd();Levandowski and Uber might've managed to keep things under the   radar, were it not for a LIDAR component vendor (apparently   inadvertently) copying Waymo on an email to Uber, in which   attached documents bore a ""striking resemblance"" to Waymo's own   LIDAR designs.Alphabet knows a thing or two about computers, and the details   of Levandowski's data dig only served to make the alleged act of   design theft look even more provable. So what does this mean for   Alphabet, Uber, and the future of self-driving car stocks?Blinded by the smite?Lawsuits are a norm, not an anomaly, among major corporations.   Alphabet itself is under constant legal attack: At the moment,   it's facing antitrust inquiries in the European Union, Argentina,   India, Brazil, Russia, and South Korea, as well as patent   violation and intellectual property claims by the likes ofOracle. As a privately held company, Uber doesn't announce its legal   matters in a single spot, but a quick search turns up hundreds of   suits.On issues of intellectual property, in particular, lawsuits   can get particularly sticky. If proven guilty, Uber will likely   cough up buckets of cash to Alphabet since, in Alphabet's words,   Uber has avoided ""incurring the risk, time, and expense of   independently developing their own technology."" By Alphabet's   calculation, that includes the $680 million valuation of OttoandUber's entire self-driving program, since they believe it   would've otherwise stayed stalled.That counterfactual claim is hard to prove, and it may also be   difficult to disentangle Uber's own recent advances in   self-driving technology. It's impossible for Uber staff to forget   what they now know, and almost as impossible for them to even   determine whether what they know is Alphabet's or Uber's.A signal for self-driving car stocksImage source: Getty Images.More so than anything else, this lawsuit serves as a warning   for self-driving car companies and their shareholders. Alphabet,   Uber, and others are in a fierce competition to build the best   self-driving car out there, and any attempt to cheat will be met   with the full force of the law.But investors shouldn't equate lawsuits with bankruptcy.   Rather, they should take a ""buyer beware"" stance and ask whether   a given lawsuit is a warning sign of a deeper issue. An   intellectual property lawsuit could be an indicator of an overly   competitive company culture, a short-term issue, or even a lack   of creative talent. Which problem is at the root of the suit   could be a better indicator about the ultimate direction of the   corporate defendant's stock than the specific legal details. So   if you're an investor in autonomous car companies, remember to   look out for lawsuits, read into them the right things, and make   informed choices as you hunt for the biggest potential winners in   this increasingly competitive race.10 stocks we like better than Alphabet (A     shares)When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

The campus is expected to be completed within 30 months.The centerpiece of the office space that Google describes as ""photovoltaic integrated canopy skin"" will generate renewable energy through solar power and have indoor climate, sound and air quality control mechanisms.To further decrease consumption of electricity, smile-shaped clerestories spanning two sides of each 102-foot bay will bring natural light in to the building.Google's expansion plan in north Mountain View is a reminder that Silicon Valley based tech giants are striving to build more impressive and futuristic office spaces.In 2015, FacebookFBmoved to a 430,000 square foot extensive campus.

Why Apple Inc. (AAPL) May Have 1,000+ Engineers Working on AR;3/2/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThere is growing speculation thatApple Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AAPL) next big thing is augmented reality. Of course, the 10th anniversary iPhone 8 looms large as the critical hardware release this year, but the new iPhone could well be part of that Apple AR strategy. A new report adds more fuel to the fire, suggesting Apple may have over 1,000 engineers currently working on an augmented reality project in Israel.makeArticleAd();Source: NianticBusiness Insiderpublished a report based on a research note by UBS, suggesting augmented reality is likely to be ""Apple's next major product innovation.""The UBS Report on Apple AR ProjectUBS analyst Steven Milunovich points out the increasing frequency of Apple CEO Tim Cook's public comments about augmented reality.He has repeatedly stated that AR will be a much bigger deal than virtual reality, suggesting that Apple is not following the path ofFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) and its Oculus Rift VR headset. While suggesting that he believes augmented reality could be as big as the iPhone, Cook also points out that he doesn't see it as a standalone product, but more as a core technology that is incorporated into other products.That suggests the Apple AR focus is on implementing advanced augmented reality technology that could be part of the iPhone 8. There have already been clues that AAPL isup to something big with the new iPhone's camera. Apple has also acquired a number of companies working on technology that could be applicable to augmented reality, includingPrimeSense(3D sensing),RealFace(facial recognition) andMetaio(software-based augmented reality solution).7 Stocks to Buy That Are ALMOST in Buffett Buying RangeCiting industry sources, Milunovich says, ""the company may have over 1,000 engineers working on a project in Israel that could be related to AR."" Why Israel? Both PrimeSense and RealFace are Israeli companies. Keeping the Apple AR team in that country would minimize disruption, and remove it from snooping media in Silicon Valley.The UBS research note concludes that Apple's moves could result in ""moderate 3D mapping … and possibly an AR software development kit"" being available as early as the iPhone 8 launch.How Likely Is the Apple AR Project?Predicting AAPL product development is always risky because the company seldom confirms any details, it maintains a veil of secrecy around new products and some prototypes never see the light of day as an actual product release. Like that long-rumoredApple television.However, the fact that Tim Cook has been so vocal about playing up augmented reality suggests he is setting the stage for anAAPL augmented reality announcement.Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Just Succeeded Where Apple Inc. (AAPL) FailedThe number of people the analyst believes are currently working on the Apple AR project also lends credence to the theory that it is both real, and a big deal. Apple is a huge company, but a team of over 1,000 engineers still stands out. For comparison, in the lead-up to the Apple Watch release, it was reported that AAPL hadassembled a team of 100 engineersto work on that top-secret product.Then there's the reality - not AR or VR, but real life reality - that for the past decade Apple stock has been propelled by the iPhone. And the smartphone market is maturing. The 10th anniversary iPhone 8 will undoubtedly pay off with a big spike in sales, but that is unlikely to last. The company needs something compelling enough to kick off a whole new cycle of iPhone upgrades.That's the Apple AR project. If Tim Cook can convince people that augmented reality is our spectacular future, and Apple can deliver a compelling AR experience that's built right into an iPhone - no dorky headsets required, no additional equipment to buy and no VR motion sickness - then Apple stock is just getting started.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceWhat Is Apple Inc.

Chevron Corporation (CVX) Stock Is Going to Gush Higher;3/2/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOn Wednesday, March 1, the stock market made another explosive move higher after a generally well-received speech by President Donald Trump to Congress. Among the leaders of Wednesday's rally were energy stocks - includingChevron Corporation(NYSE:CVX) - which had largely been lagging for the year-to-date.makeArticleAd();CVX stock gained more than 1% yesterday, and now it appears to be set up for more upside through multiple time frames.Let's face it: Profitable trading and investing is no easy task, particularly consistently staying on the right side of the market over a longer period of time. However, a straightforward and repeatable process with a focus on the ""easy trade"" at any given point in time can dramatically simplify the task for traders.Often, I believe the ""easy trade"" can be identified by looking for new relative strength or relative weakness within the stock market's sectors and industry groups.Case in point? The energy sector of theS&P 500, as represented by theEnergy Select Sector SPDR (ETF)(NYSEARCA:XLE), has largely limped behind the broader U.S. stock market rally so far in 2017. But for the week-to-date, I'm noticing a pickup in relative strength that could ultimately lead this sector to play catch-up with the S&P 500.7 Stocks to Buy That Are ALMOST in Buffett Buying RangeAlthough this week is far from over and thus this newfound relative strength is still unproven, shares of CVX stock - at least in relative terms versus the energy sector - are exhibiting some promising price action.CVX Stock ChartsLook at the ratio chart below. I've plotted Chevron stock against the XLE, and we see that so far this week, CVX is attempting to break past diagonal resistance that has been firmly in place for the past few years.Click to EnlargeIn other words, this chart displays that CVX stock is a strong stock within a sector that is beginning to show better relative strength. This, I like.On the multiyear weekly chart, we see that Chevron - after breaking past the black horizontal as well as the 200-week simple moving average (red) in November 2016 - has since successfully retested this area around the $110 level and begun to bounce.Click to EnlargeIn many ways, this ""retesting"" of prior resistance is now taking the form of what I would label a bull flag pattern, which as the name suggests, implies a continuation higher in price. Through this lens, a next upside target is around the late 2016 highs near $120.Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Could Break $1,000 If ...Zooming in on the daily chart, we see that last week CVX stock found support at its 100-day simple moving average (blue) and on Wednesday attempted to break out of a multiweek sideways consolidation phase marked by the blue box.Click to EnlargeA break and hold above $114.50 would set Chevron stock up for a rally toward the aforementioned $120 area as a next upside target. Any bearish reversal from here - particularly a break below last week's lows near $109.50 - would call off this bullish setup at least for the near term.Like what you see?

Snap Admits It Has No Moat;3/1/2017;"A moat is one of the most important things needed for a   company to succeed. The term, coined by Warren Buffett, is a   flowery way of describing a competitive advantage, which will   protect the company's profits and market share (the castle) from   competing businesses.Snap(NYSE: SNAP) , by its own admission, doesn't have a moat.""In a world where anyone can distribute products instantly and   provide them for free, the best way to compete is by innovating   to create the most engaging products. That's because it's   difficult to use distribution or cost as a competitive advantage   -- new software is available to users immediately, and for free,""   management wrote in the company's S-1 filing.makeArticleAd();In other words, Snap believes the only way to compete in its   market is to out-innovate its competitors likeFacebook(NASDAQ: FB) and Google, theAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) subsidiary. But what we've already   seen is that simply being innovative isn't enough if a larger   competitor can just copy the innovation.Image source: Snap.Snap's ""innovation"" budget is significantly smaller than   competitors'Snap spent $184 million on research and development (R&D)   last year. That's nothing compared to Alphabet, Facebook, or evenTwitter(NYSE:TWTR) . Keep in mind, Twitter is reducing its R&D   expenditure.Company2016 R&D ExpenseR&D as a Percentage of RevenueSnap$0.18 billion45.4%Alphabet$13.95 billion15.5%Facebook$5.92 billion21.4%Twitter$0.71 billion28.2%Data source: SEC filings and company quarterly reports.To be sure, as a percentage of revenue, Snap reinvested much   more than any of its competitors. But it's unlikely Snap will   continue investing that high of a percentage of revenue into   R&D. It simply can't afford to if it wants to show investors   that it has any potential at all of becoming profitable at some   point.Snap's cost of revenue is its biggest expense, and it alreadycommitted to spending $3 billion on cloud   infrastructure over the next five years.Snap doesn't have the resources to out-innovate its   competition, even if it's significantly more focused than any of   them.Even if it does out-innovate...Snapchat is certainly an innovative app. It's changed the way   people communicate, and it quickly grew very popular. Growth has   slowed in recent months, however, as its competitors --   specifically Facebook -- have attempted to copy some of its core   functionality.Facebook has been trying to copy Snapchat ever since it tried   to buy the company way back in 2013. While several attempts were   unsuccessful, Facebook kept at it until it found a winner. Its   recent success withInstagram Storiesdemonstrates the risk Snapchat explains in its S-1. It must keep   innovating to stay ahead of competitors copying its product.But where Snap claims ""it's difficult to use distribution   [...] as a competitive advantage,"" Facebook is showing exactly   the opposite. It's developed a huge competitive advantage because   it has a launching pad for new products like Instagram Stories or   Facebook Live. The company went from nearly 0 to 100 million   hours of video views per day in just over a year and a half.To say distribution isn't a competitive advantage ignores a   significant part of the value of Facebook's massive audience.   While not everything it launches succeeds, the odds are stacked   in Facebook's favor. That's evident from the success of Instagram   Stories and other product features Facebook blatantly borrowed   from competitors like Twitter, such as live video and trending   topics.Distribution isn't a competitive advantage for Snap (at least   relative to giants like Facebook and Google), but that doesn't   mean it's not a competitive advantage for Facebook or Google.   That fact makes Snap's admitted lack of a moat even more of a   risk for investors.10 stocks we like better than Snap Inc.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

YouTube Tops 1 Billion Hours a Day: Can It Pass TV?;3/1/2017;"YouTube looks to take down television as the most watched format in the U.S.The Wall Street Journalreported users worldwide are watching more than one billion hours of videos a day on the online video platform.The one billion hours is partially the result of the artificial intelligence that is used to recommend videos and keep people tuned in. The number of hours watched has increased 10-fold since 2012, when YouTube started building algorithms that look into user data to give each user a personalized lineup of videos.Currently, TV still holds the title as the most watched platform in the U.S. with 1.25 billion hours people spent watching each day, while TV also beat YouTube and other online streaming services in revenue generated from ads. YouTube may not be far off on the hours but it still has a long way to go on revenue.The content on the website is generated by users all around the world, professional or not. These users are uploading 400 hours of video each minute, or 65 years of video a day to YouTube.YouTube Profits?It is not clear how much money YouTube is generating for Alphabet Inc.GOOGLThe Wall Street Journalreported in 2015 that YouTube generated about $4 billion in 2014 and that division is ""roughly break-even.""The video-sharing website makes most of its revenue by running ads before videos; however, it is not enough when taking the heavy cost of technology and rights to content into account. YouTube struggles to expand its core audience beyond teens and to gain users that visit YouTube.com daily instead of coming from other websites from links or embedded videos. The company relies on popular videos, music videos and content created by the users to gain traffic. YouTube's content tends to attract only a few population groups; as a result, not all companies are willing to pay for ads on YouTube, even when YouTube has one billion hours watched.While YouTube focuses on the content that its users put out, competitors like Amazon.com Inc.AMZNand Netflix Inc.NFLXfocus on licensing Hollywood-produced content and creating original programmingto attract a wide range of audiences.Next StepsHowever, the new deal between Alphabet Inc.and Comcast Corp.CMCSAmight increase the traffic on YouTube. On Monday, YouTube and Comcast announced that Comcast customers with the latest gear would be able to search and watch YouTube videos through their cable boxes.Google also helps YouTube tremendously in gaining new viewers with its enormous reach on the Internet. YouTube videos are embedded in search results and Google pre-installs the YouTube app on its Android software. The website is also starting to secure rights to sports videos and shows for children.On Tuesday, YouTube announced YouTube TV, their service to disrupt traditional cable providers. For $35 per month, users will be able to stream major broadcast networks like CBS, ABC, NBC and FOX. Users will still get YouTube's original programming and sports networks like ESPN.""Millennial love great TV content, but they don't want to watch it in the traditional setting,"" said Susan Wojcicki, YouTube CEO at YouTube TV's launch event.While YouTube is on pace to surpass TV in hours spent watching in the U.S., the company also focuses on their algorithms and software in identifying and catering the needs of their audiences. By expanding in this regard and working on their targeting, YouTube can become America's favorite visual platform.Everything You Need to Know About Snapchat BEFORE It Goes PublicmakeArticleAd();You may be curious about the buzz surrounding Snap Inc.'s IPO on March 2.

Amazon.com, Inc.’s (AMZN) AWS Outage Is a Big Deal;3/1/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsYesterday,Amazon.com, Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AMZN) vice president of cloud architecture strategy, Adrian Cockcroft, gave apresentation at a tech conference. Of course, he extolled the virtues of his company's cloud platform, called AWS (Amazon Web Services). Meanwhile, the service was experiencing a major outage.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockGranted, the impact on Amazon stock was fairly minor. Yet, investors should still be concerned. Let's face it, AWS is critical for AMZN stock.Last year, this business segment reported a56% spike in revenues to $12.2 billionand operating income came to $3.1 billion. There are over 1 million active customers. More importantly, Amazon Web Services essentially subsidizes the core ecommerce business - which has razor-thin margins - but also allows for the heavy investments in efforts like video/music streaming, Alexa and devices like the Kindle.7 Stocks That Will Hit All-Time Highs in 2017As for the AWS outage, it lasted roughlyfour hoursand resulted in the disruption of thousands of websites and cloud apps across the US. Some of the high-profile companies that were impacted includedApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL),Twitter Inc(NYSE:TWTR) andTwilio Inc(NYSE:TWLO).At the heart of this was the failure of the S3 system, which provides for the efficient storage of content. The irony is that AMZN could not even access its own dashboard to deal with the problems - since it was also hosted on the AWS platform!The Real Impact?It is important to keep the outage in perspective. For the most part, Amazon Web Services has a great track record, with uptime that is over 99%. As a result, whenever there is a major outage, there is quite a bit of buzz.Besides, AWS is a standout offering. Over the years, AMZN has added great features - such as for data analytics, AI (artificial intelligence) and improved security functions - and has also been diligent with lowering pricing. Yet, this does not mean the outage is trivial. It's reasonable to assume that there are many companies that are evaluating the situation. After all, should there be more usage of alternative systems?Well, I think so. Note that other internet giants are leveraging their own systems to provide cloud services, as seen withAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG). Google is even the main vendor for the fast-growingSnap Inc(NYSE:SNAP), which has signed a$2 billion contract.Oh, and many old-line tech operators have been investing heavily in their cloud systems. Just some includeInternational Business Machines Corp.(NYSE:IBM),Oracle Corporation(NYSE:ORCL),Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co(NYSE:HPE) andMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT). All these companies have key advantages like trusted brands, global infrastructures and massive customer bases.Interestingly enough, these companies also have something else: They provide hybrid solutions, such as a blend of cloud services and on-premise technologies. This means a customer can place their mission-critical systems on private servers, which would mean no disruption if there was an outage of AWS.Bottom Line for AMZN StockOK then, with the outage of AWS, there should still not necessarily panic. The market opportunity for the cloud is massive - with plenty of room for multiple players. What's more, the financial costs for the outage will probably be immaterial. According to Global Equities' Trip Chowdhry, he thinks that there could be a2% drop in revenues for the first quarter.Procter & Gamble Co (PG) Stock Remains a Good Bet for InvestorsIf there are a couple more outages, however, then the situation could get dicey. When it comes to cloud hosting, there aren't too many second chances.Tom Taulli runs the InvestorPlace blogIPO Playbookand is the author of various books, includingTaxes 2017: Saving A Bundle.Follow him on Twitter at@ttaulli.

Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Just Succeeded Where Apple Inc. (AAPL) Failed;3/1/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL) isn't exactly a direct competitor toApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL), but the former just eclipsed the latter, and seemingly out of nowhere.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');Source: GoogleOne of the worst-kept secrets in the industry has been Apple's determination to get into the TV business. The company has been working for years trying to put together an online TV service, hoping to offer 25 channels for between $30 and $40 monthly. That project seemed to have been put on hold when AAPL and broadcasters couldn't reach an agreement on price.But Alphabet has just succeeded where Apple failed.YouTube TV - live TV from over 40 providers including the big networks for $35 per month - is now official.YouTube TV Takes on CableYouTube TVwas announced on Tuesday. Launching ""soon"" in the U.S., this is Google's skinny TV bundle for cord cutters. The four major networks are onboard. So isWalt Disney Co's(NYSE:DIS) ESPN, along with regional sports networks. Google is also including some content from its premium YouTube Red service. All told, there will be over 40 different content providers - not bad for $35 per month.Subscribers get unlimited cloud DVR storage, search powered by Google's AI, six user accounts (three streams can be active simultaneously) and the ability to watch YouTube TV on a variety of devices including smartphones, tablets, PCs and Google Chromecast.Why Apple Inc. (AAPL) Will Become a Trillion-Dollar CompanyIn other word, this is pretty much what Apple has been struggling to release.YouTubeTV is Eerily Similar to Apple's Television PlansApple has to have been watching Google's YouTube TV announcement with dismay. Its rival beat it to the punch with the streaming TV bundle it had envisioned offering with the Apple TV.What makes it even more galling is how close YouTube TV is to what AAPL was negotiating.In May 2015, AAPL andCBS Corporation(NYSE:CBS) were in talks about a subscription Apple television streaming service, butmoney was reportedly a sticking point. In December of that year, CBS CEO Les Moonves confirmed toBusiness Insiderthat his network had been in talks with Apple, and were close to settling on a monthly price to charge consumers. Moonves was throwing around $35 - exactly the price that YouTube TV is charging.Apple balked. Apparently Google was waiting in the wings.Where Does This Leave AAPL and Its TV Strategy?At this point, Apple's entire television strategy seems to be struggling.There was hope that the new Apple TV that launched in 2015 would come with a streaming TV bundle. That didn't happen. Now Apple's set-top streamer is suffering from disappointing sales. The box costs twice what Google andAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) charge for their streamers, but lacks the 4K support rivals offer.Last year, AAPL was showing off anew TV appthat would serve as a hub for streaming content, tracking use across multiple services and devices. But it failed to get buy-in fromNetflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX), making its usefulness questionable.Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Could Break $1,000 If ...Google's YouTube TV launch is the icing on the cake.Where Can Apple Go From Here?Don't expect Apple to give up on its plans, of course.The signs of a renewed push toward taking over your living room began last month. Applehired the former head of Amazon's Fire TVto take over as the head of marketing for Apple TV. This move has raised expectations that AAPL will revamp its Apple TV hardware. It also freed up the previous head of Apple TV to helplead Apple's efforts to sign content deals- something he had considerable experience in from his previous role as senior VP of content distribution atHulu.While YouTube TV offers a fixed content bundle, AAPL had always pushed for subscribers having an option to choose their own bundle, Moonves says. If the company can accomplish that goal, it still can position an Apple television streaming service as being something unique.With YouTube TV, Google may have beaten Apple to the punch when it comes to being first of the tech giants to offer a cheap way to cut the cable, but the war is likely just beginning.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceWhat Is Apple Inc.

Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Could Break $1,000 If …;3/1/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAndroid, fromAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL), is the dominant mobile operating system. It runs on nearly nine of every 10 mobile phones, worldwide. But that's never really been a primary reason to by GOOGL stock … or at least not directly.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockFrom an investor standpoint, you would still rather buyApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) because Apple monetizes iOS the way a butcher monetizes a pig. Google, on the other hand, just gives its OS away to OEMs.That's not to say Google doesn't make any money off Android, though. Simply by offering its search engine and Google Play store through the software, GOOGL rakes in billions of dollars.But, the Android ecosystem is extremely fragmented. Compared toAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) - which runs its own store and hasits own browser and search engine- Google's take is a mere fraction.What if that changed? Would it mean anything to GOOGL stock holders?Controlling AndroidWhile Google is not yet charging OEMs to use its software, the company has been quietly trying to gain control of its creation. Management is pushing OEMs to deliver security updates on a monthly basis. This is important, as crooks push malware onto older, unpatched phones.7 Stocks That Will Hit All-Time Highs in 2017Google's newest handset, the Pixel, is designed to be as good as an iPhone. Reviews, however, have been mixed. The company is even trying to getback into Chinathrough its OEMs (the world's largest market tossed Google back in 2010 over censorship).Still, Google has its work cut out for itself.Samsung Electronic(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) dominates the Android market. OEMs and consumers see this fragmentation as an advantage, even though it allows bugs to multiply because they may appear on one device or brand only.The operating system itself is hopelessly fragmented. Google is only now rolling out its Marshmallow and Nougat versions of Android andstill developing the ""O"" version, while many users have devices that still run the KitKat version. My own Android phone runs on Lollipop, (simply because it lacks the storage to run anything newer).The way Google eventually gets its arms around all of this may be throughAndromeda, an operating system for both Android and its laptop Chromebook devices. Unifying software platforms would give Alphabet Inc the kind of power that Microsoft only dreamed of with its Windows operating system.Bottom Line on GOOGL StockIf Alphabetwereto start monetizing Android, would investors even notice?Alphabet continues to grow at 20% per year, powered by advertising on its main Search site and YouTube. The company brings approximately 25 cents of every dollar to the net income line, its balance sheet carries almost no debt, and operating cash flow is ridiculous ($36 billion last year alone, more than twice what it achieved just two years prior). In 2016, Alphabet had revenue in excess of $90 billion.Over the last year, the price of GOOGL stock is up nearly 17%, and the non-voting GOOG shares are up even more. The company's market cap of $577 billion trails only that of Apple. Six months ago,they were nearly level, but that was before Apple's recent run to new highs.Alphabet Inc CFO Ruth Porat's program of paring non-performing assets and forcing ""other bets"" (like the company's self-driving car unit, now called Waymo) to make it on their own has paid off. Google's investment balances have been growing steadily, along with its asset base.Why Apple Inc. (AAPL) Will Become a Trillion-Dollar CompanyWhat's most amazing is how Alphabet continues to underperform. Android is not a major profit center, and Google Cloud is often considered third in the market, behind Amazon and Microsoft. Google was late to the voice party with Google Assistant, which allowed Amazon to get the drop on it. Plus, the hardware line is loaded with ""me too"" products, and GOOGL leads in precisely zero categories.Still, Porat has performed well in providing discipline to Google executives, but she has not propelled Alphabet to market leadership outside of Search.If assets such as Android became true profit centers, GOOGL stock would be well on its way to $1,000 per share and becoming the first trillion-dollar company.Dana Blankenhornis a financial and technology journalist.

AT&T Inc. (T) Stock’s Relationship with Facebook and Alphabet: Friends, Enemies or Both?;3/1/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMajor telecom companies, likeAT&T Inc.(NYSE:T), have a complicated relationship with tech companies likeFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) andAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL).makeArticleAd();Source:Mike Mozart via FlickrTelecoms envy Facebook and Alphabet's profits and stock performance. Since January 2009, Alphabet stock is up 460%, while AT&T stock rose only 49%. And telecoms like AT&T particularly resent the fact that internet companies like Alphabet and Facebook gained these profits while piggybacking on the equipment the telecoms spent tens of billions of dollars installing. You wouldn't be able to access websites such as this one or Facebook without the help of a telecom, such as AT&T.On the other hand, when people access Facebook or search Google, they are using data, which means more business for telecoms.But tech companies hurt telecoms when they cannibalize their revenue with apps like Viber and Messenger and WhatsApp. Using WhatsApp is cheaper than sending a text message, and has causedtext message volumeto decline.Storm Clouds on AT&T's HorizonBut that's not all. Alphabet and Facebook now are looking to compete with the core business of telecom providers such as AT&T. Alphabet'sProject Fi, in collaboration withSprint Corp(NYSE:S) andT-Mobile US Inc(NASDAQ:TMUS), will free users from signing a contract with a single network. This allows users to switch between networks depending on which one has the best signal quality.8 of the Most Overrated Stocks on Wall Street Right NowAnd that's not all. Alphabet has more projects, includingProject LoonandGoogle Fiber, in the works. These also threaten telecoms like AT&T. And Facebook is doing likewise, withFree Basics,Express Wi-Fiand theAquiladrone project.Why are tech companies like Alphabet and Facebook doing this? Why don't they just stick to their core businesses, search and social networks?Well, Alphabet and Facebook derive most of their revenue from advertising. More people receiving access to the internet means more people viewing ads, and more revenue for Alphabet and Facebook's core businesses. If people can't access the internet, they can't bring the two companies revenue.Alphabet and Facebook want to see more people using the internet, and if this means using drones or balloons to bring access to remote regions, so be it. With greater availability of bandwidth, traffic on their websites will go up.So are Facebook and Alphabet threats to T stock? Well, yes, in some ways. But in other ways they may help telecoms like AT&T by pioneering open-source hardware and software-defined networking. They have their own reasons for doing so, and this could help AT&T by lowering the cost of equipment which AT&T uses.Facebook/Alphabet vs. T Stock: FriendsIn an article I wrote inNovember, I discussed Facebook and Alphabet's efforts to develop open-source networking equipment. Currently, companies likeCisco Systems, Inc.(NASDAQ:CSCO) make money by selling proprietary hardware and software to telecoms and internet providers like AT&T.Networking equipment has been described as a""black box,""where hardware and software are bundled together by the same vendor. Software from other companies might not run smoothly on one company's hardware. Companies like Cisco can earn high margins on these proprietary products. Routing equipment has not yet beencommoditizedlike other hardware, such as servers.But the development ofsoftware-defined networkingandnetwork functions virtualizationcould change this. These trends involve using open-source software and hardware instead of more expensive proprietary versions. Telecoms like AT&T can then save money by switching to cheaper, interchangeable""white box""switches and routers.Alphabet and Facebook are taking advantage of this, and making their own networking equipment.Facebook developed its ownSDNswitch, theWedge, and open-sourced the Linux-based software to go along with that, FBOSS. It made the design for the Wedgeavailable to the publicthrough the Open Compute Project. Customers can order this from contract manufacturers, which sell it at a low margin, cheaper than Cisco's products. Facebook also released an open-sourcetransponderthrough theTelecom Infrastructure Project, which focuses on networking hardware for telecoms.Facebook hopes that releasing these to the public will speed up innovation, which will in turn benefit Facebook, a major hardware user.Similarly, Alphabet built its own massivesoftware-defined network.How does this benefit AT&T? Well, GOOG and FB are pioneering a technology which promises to lower costs for T stock. Through itsDomain 2.0program, AT&T is taking advantage of software-defined networking and network function virtualization. Last year, AT&T announced its intention tovirtualize 75% of its network by 2020. These technologies allow it to do more with less. They appear to bereducing capexat AT&T, which would boost free cash flow and raise T stock. It also expects SDN and NFV to save it money onoperating costs.Facebook/Alphabet vs. AT&T: EnemiesBut GOOG and FB also may harm T stock by getting into the telecom business.GOOG'sProject Ficonnects users to the network with the best signal at the moment, whether that's Wi-Fi or 4G LTE offered by T-Mobile and Sprint. Normally, mobile phone subscribers must go with one service: AT&T,Verizon Communications Inc(NYSE:VZ), or others. This could force telecom operators to improve their signal quality in order to compete.Alphabet also offers Google Fiber, a high-speed fiber optics service available in some select cities in the United States. AT&T must feel threatened by this; last year AT&T andComcast Corporation(NASDAQ:CMCSA)sued Nashvilleafter the cityvoted to approveGoogle Fiber.Alphabet is also working on the previously mentioned Project Loon, an effort to deploy telecom equipment in balloons 20km from the earth's surface. Since the equipment in a balloon is higher off the ground than an LTE tower, it can provide a greater area with internet access.Facebook is doing likewise with the Aquila drone, Facebook Express Wi-Fi and Facebook Free Basics. Free Basics brings internet access to200 million peoplein countries like Brazil and the Philippines.Impact on AT&TThe harmful effects of Facebook and Alphabet on AT&T stock may be a bit overstated.Facebook has expressed its intention towork togetherwith telecoms to roll out 5G technology.Nick Foxof Alphabet has stated that Alphabet's intention is not to compete with telecoms and put them out of business. Indeed, Alphabet is cooperating withthree telecomsin Indonesia to test Project Loon.And Alphabet and Facebook may be doing telecoms like AT&T a favor by bearing some of the risk in these ventures. Telecoms are more conservative than Facebook and Alphabet and wouldn't want to bear these risks on their own. Telecoms like AT&T may benefit from the more efficient deployment of telecom equipment via balloons, which cover a wider area than towers.Also, many of these regions the two are targeting are regionswithout much internet access.Facebook and Alphabet wouldn't be threatening AT&T by bringing internet access to regions in Africa, where T stock derives little if any revenue.Could Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Take a Hint From Best Buy Co Inc (BBY)?But some of these undertakings, such as Google Fiber and Project Fi, will probably be a headache for AT&T and holders of T stock.So it seems Facebook and Alphabet could best be described as AT&T's ""frenemies.""As of writing, Lucas Hahn did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace7 MLPs to Buy With High (And Growing!)

Potential Stock Market Winners of 2025;3/1/2017;"If you're a long-term investor, you have to think on an   investment time scale that is more than a year or two away. The   greatest investments are the ones that can generate positive   returns for decades into the future. It sounds simple at first,   but when you start asking yourself questions like, ""Where is this   company/stock in 2025?"" it becomes much more difficult .So, we asked three of our contributors that very question.   Which companies do you see generating great returns for investors   all the way out to 2025? Here's a quick rundown as to why they   picked retail bankU.S. Bancorp(NYSE: USB) , solar panel manufacturerFirst Solar(NASDAQ: FSLR) , and water utilityAmerican Water Works(NYSE: AWK) .Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();A bank to buy and holdJordan Wathen(U.S. Bancorp):One of the best-managed banks in the country, U.S. Bancorp   has been left out of the post-election bank stock boom. That's no   fault of its own, though. After provisions for losses, U.S.   Bancorp enjoys a roughly 50-50 split of interest income and fee   income, making its earnings less sensitive to rate increases like   other banks that have seen their share prices surge.I think investors are undervaluing the downside protection   afforded by diversified sources of fee income, and overvaluing   the potential for higher rates to fuel bank profits. In effect,   investors are placing too much importance on what makes banks   great over the short term rather than what makes them great over   the long haul.U.S. Bancorp's historical underwriting performance tells the   tale of its conservative culture. At the depths of the financial   crisis, net charge-offs peaked at 2.17% of average loans in 2010.   Though it may seem unremarkable on an absolute basis, consider   that ""retail loans"" made up 33% of its loan book at the time, a   majority of which were clustered in credit cards and home equity   loans that ravaged banks across the country.U.S. Bancorp can play offense, too. Its deposit franchise   gives it pricing power to hold down its cost of deposits, which   recently averaged just 0.28%. On the asset side of the equation,   its commercial loan portfolio should generate incremental income   from rate increases.On a recent conference call, a bank executive pointed out that   its commercial customers were using an average of 25% of their   credit lines. One would expect that faster economic growth could   bring higher balances, higher benchmark interest rates, and more   interest income. U.S. Bancorp has everything investors could want   in a bank to hold for years at a time.The sun is still rising on this investment opportunityTyler Crowe(First Solar):The solar industry is a difficult-to-understand, and at times   frustrating, industry to follow. That's because it's both a   high-growthanda cyclical industry at the same time. The problem is, too many   investors simply look at it as the former and neglect to remember   the latter. While overall solar power consumption grows at   near-exponential rates every year, panel manufacturers like First   Solar go through fierce supply-and-demand cycles as new capacity   and new technology come online.This past year is a great example of an industry downturn. The   industry is still growing, but it hit a patch of slower growth   recently that brought down prices for new panels and   utility-scale projects. However, the industry is expected to pick   back up again in earnest as renewable sources such as solar have   moved so far down the cost curve that they are now competitive   with fossil fuel power plants even without subsidies. As   technology improves, costs will continue to decline, and solar   will be able to take a larger market share and expand margins.   Keep in mind, global electricity demand over the next 25 years   will require that we build 8 times the current generation   capacity in the U.S.This gives First Solar an immense growth runway over the next   decade, and it is one of the best-positioned panel manufacturers   and utility-scale power developers out there to reap rewards from   this opportunity. The company has one of the most pristine   balance sheets in the business, its low-cost, thin-film solar   panel design is rapidly improving its efficiency metrics, and it   is one of the only companies in the business whose returns on   invested capital have outpaced its cost of capital -- which is   essential for a company to grow and create wealth over time.The solar industry still very much looks like the wild west of   energy, with new entrants rising and falling quickly, but First   Solar is looking like the company that has the potential to turn   this fast-growing market into one that really generates long-term   returns for investors.As close to a sure-thing, long-term winner as it getsBeth McKenna(American Water Works):I believe American Water Works -- the largest publicly traded   water and wastewater utility in the United States -- is as close   as it gets to a sure-thing 2025 winning stock. Moreover, I   believe it has a good shot at significantly outperforming the   market over the next nearly nine years -- through the end of 2025   -- just as it has done in the nearly-nine years since going   public:Data byYCharts.Since its April 2008 IPO, American Water's total return of   376% has crushed the S&P 500's return of 108% and pulverized   the returns of popular stocksIBMandGeneral Electric.

The Snapchat IPO Will Be a Short-Term Winner, Long-Term Loser;3/1/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThis Thursday, theSnap Inc(NYSE:SNAP) IPO is expected to hit the markets. The current price range on the deal is $14 to $16, which means that the company could raise over $3 billion. It seems like a good bet there will be a nice move on the upside, but you will probably not get any shares at offering price.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockRather, you'll have to take your chances in the aftermarket, which can be dicey. So how should you approach SNAP? Ultimately, it depends on your time frame.Let's take a look at some potential strategies:Snapchat IPO: The Long-Term TradeA lot of investors are wondering: Will this be similar to the opening ofFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) orTwitter Inc(NYSE:TWTR)?After all, the performances are a stark contrast. FB has logged a gain of 254% since its debut while TWTR has lost a grueling 62%.8 of the Most Overrated Stocks on Wall Street Right NowUnfortunately, for the Snapchat IPO, I think there is a better chance that the returns will look more like the latter. Why? Snap Inc looks more like a niche operator. The 18-to-34 year-old category is certainly a valuable niche, as many advertisers have a tough time reaching this demographic, but the market opportunity may prove to be relatively small.According to Pivotal analyst Brian Wieser, the revenues from youth-oriented cable channels like MTV, VH1, Comedy Central and Adult Swim come to roughly$3 billion per year.Besides, if SNAP is unable to break out of its niche, the company will certainly be challenged in keeping up the growth of its user base. Actually, there has already been a deceleration. It went from 21 million net adds in Q2 of last year to only5 million by Q4.But there are some other issues that could be a problem for long-term holders of Snapchat stock:The net losses remain significant, coming to $514.6 million in 2016. This compares to revenues of$404.5 million.The competition continues to get tougher. To this end, FB's Instagram has been essentially matching many of SNAP's core features (and this may help explain the deceleration in the user growth). According to InvestorPlace contributorChris Lau: ""When FB launched Facebook Stories above the news feed, it took away a reason for millennials to leave the site and use SNAP. Similarly, Instagram Stories usage grew to 150 million daily active users in just five months.""There are signs that Spectacles, which are glasses that allow you to take photos and videos, may be losing much of their appeal. According to theWall Street Journal, SNAP recently closed a pop-up store in New York City where ""there were often more employees than shoppers.""SNAP has a contingent liability of$2 billion. This is what the company must pay - until 2022 - toAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) for cloud services.Public shareholders will not have the right to vote. This will mean it will be nearly impossible for an activist investor to get any traction if there are problems with SNAP.There is no headquarters, which could make it tough for allowing collaboration.Snapchat IPO: The Short-Term PlayWhile the risk factors mentioned above are downright scary, they probably won't amount to much during the next few months. If anything, the Snapchat IPO is likely to be a great vehicle for traders.One key reason for this is technical: The amount of shares on the market will be fairly small. This means it will not take much buying power to move Snapchat stock.Why Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Will Always Be Much Stronger Than SnapchatInterestingly enough, it looks like the company has been taking steps to keep the float tight. To this end, SNAP is requiring some investors to notsell 50 million of the 200 million sharesthat will be offered.Of course, there will be some other factors that will help drive the momentum. Keep in mind that SNAP likely has various deals lined up, which should gin up buzz over time. It also helps that there has been a dearth of IPO activity over the last year. Oh, and of course, the overall equities markets have been in a powerful bull mode, which is always critical for IPOs.Overall, things are lining up quite nicely for the Snapchat IPO, yet this is probably not a stock to hold on for too long.Tom Taulli runs the InvestorPlace blogIPO Playbookand is the author of various books, includingTaxes 2017: Saving A Bundle.Follow him on Twitter at@ttaulli.

The Pundits Are Wrong: Snap Is A Buy;2/28/2017;"ByToptal:Originally published onToptalbyValuation Expert Joe Matta.For those who haven't been following the news since Snap (SNAP) announced itsintentions to go public, the press cycle has been on a rollercoaster ride. Initial valuation estimates in the$20-25bn rangewere quickly followed by a few bolder claims that the IPO may fetch the company a valuationas high as $40bn. With this in mind, immediate post-announcement commentary was decisively bearish, and largely centered around the company's disproportionatelyhigh pricecompared to revenues of only $405m in 2016.As time has gone by, more thoughtful analyses have shifted attention over to Snap's growth prospects, and here significant concerns have emerged over the company'sslowing user growth, drawing comparisons to Twitter's (TWTR) lacklusterpost-IPO performance, and thus placing serious questions on the purported valuation figures. As a result, Snap has reportedlylowered its expectations, and certain estimates expect pricing to come as low as $14-$16 per share, implying a valuation of$16-19bn.makeArticleAd();Ahead of its expected pricing (anticipated onMarch 1st) we take a look at whether the rumored valuation makes sense, and provide our own guidance on where investors should be pricing the stock.We find that while overall market concerns regarding DAU growth are justified, the market is likely undervaluing the company's ARPU growth prospects and conclude that there is significant upside on the table for investors. For us, Snap is a buy.Growth is the answerAs mentioned, initial reports largely focused on comparing Snap's purported valuation to its revenues, which when compared to its peers, admittedly looks very expensive (table 1).But such an analysis misses the mark completely in two important ways. Firstly, many of the companies in Snap's peer universe are not directly comparable (Google (GOOG) (GOOGL) is a search company and Amazon (AMZN) is an online retailer, to name a few). Limiting the peer universe to Snap's most directly comparable peers, Facebook (FB) and Twitter, is a more appropriate juxtaposition (charts 1 and 2).But even when just limiting one's comparison to Facebook and Twitter, the maturity profiles of the respective companies are very different and must be accounted for. A fairer analysis would look at the metrics pre-IPO for all three (charts 3 and 4). In doing so, readers will notice that the relative valuation, albeit still expensive, looks less so than in the prior charts.There are still timing issues with such a comparison though. For reference,Facebook was eight years old and Twitter was sevenat the time of their IPOs. Snap is only five, and with 2-3 more years of growth under its belt, Snap could be a very different company.Moreover, Snap is a direct-to-mobile platform while Facebook and Twitter went public in a world in which desktop-delivery still played a dominant role. Considering the shift from desktop to mobile, Snap is entering a market with a growing user base (mobile taking share from desktop) on a delivery platform that is capturing increasing user engagement (charts 5 and 6).In summary, the different maturity profiles coupled with the different delivery platforms, both now as well as at IPO, make for a troublesome comparables-based approach when assessing Snap's valuation. Snap may look expensive when compared to its peers, but comparing to its peers is not the right approach.With the above in mind, a Snap-only analysis makes most sense. And such an analysis should almost solely be focused on one thing: growth. For any company at Snap's stage, growth is paramount to valuation, and to this end, there are fundamentally two things that affect growth going forward:1) Growth in Daily Active Users (DAUs), and2) Growth in Average Revenue Per User (ARPU)We look at these in turn.DAU Growth: Doubts LoomMuch of the more insightful analysis which emerged a few weeks after the filing has in fact focused on DAU growth. And the hawks are out in flock. Unfortunately for Snap,while initial user growth performance was impressive (chart 7), there has been a significant downtick in new users joining the platform in recent months. Despite outperforming both Facebook and Twitter in terms of user growth in the six quarters leading up to its IPO, Snap saw quarterly growth rates drop from double digit figures to only 7% in Q3 16 and, even more worryingly, to a paltry 3.3% in Q4 16 (chart 8).Management's justification for the following can be found in their S1, wherethey state:""The rate of net additional Daily Active Users was relatively   flat in the early part of the quarter ended December 31, 2016,   and accelerated in the month of December. Although we have   historically experienced lumpiness in the growth of our Daily   Active Users, we believe that the flat growth in the early part   of the quarter was primarily related to accelerated growth in   user engagement earlier in the year, diminished product   performance, and increased competition.The rate of net additional Daily Active Users accelerated in   the first half of 2016 compared to the second half of 2015,   largely due to increased user engagement from product launches   and increased adoption rates among older demographics and   international markets. This created a higher baseline of Daily   Active Users heading into the third and fourth quarters, so   incremental net additions within these quarters were more   difficult even with strong year-over-year growth. Additionally,   in mid-2016, we launched several products and released multiple   updates, which introduced a number of technical issues that   diminished the performance of our application. We believe these   performance issues resulted in a reduction in the growth of our   Daily Active Users, particularly among Android users and regions   with a higher percentage of Android devices. Finally, we also saw   increased competition both domestically and internationally in   2016, as many of our competitors launched products with similar   functionality to ours.""The above explanation thus emphasizes two key potential causes for the slowdown in growth: technical issues with their Android product, and/or increasing competition.The former,while problematic, would not be a significant cause for concern. One would think that a company funded to the tune of $2.6bn and withnearly 2,000 employees(many of them in engineering) would be able to solve this and revert the company's growth course back to what it was at the beginning of 2016.But the more worrying concern revolves around competition. Snap faces increasing pressure from competitors, particularly Facebook and Instagram, which, if unresolved, could continue to limit DAU growth going forward. In fact, it is no wonder that Snapchat's growth numbers began suffering in Q3 16 as this was exactly when Instagramlaunched Stories, a near-blatant copy of Snapchat's namesake.Unfortunately for Snap, data regarding growth in DAU by geography only lends further weight to the competition concerns. In fact, on a geographical basis, much of the slowdown in Snap's DAUs appears to have been primarily in the ""Rest of World"" region (chart 9). Given Instagram's significantly larger user base abroad (80% of Instagram's c.300m DAUs are international), one could see how the incentives for installing Snapchat diminishes as Instagram (and other competitors) begin to offer the key features that Snapchat has to-date sold itself on.To summarize, things don't look good for Snapchat from a DAU growth perspective. Not only was Q4 16 Snap's lowest growing quarter since the beginning of its publicly available data, but it was even slower than that of Facebook, a far more mature company (chart 10). Given these headwinds, Snap will have to effectively convince investors that it can address its decelerating quarter-over-quarter DAU growth if it wishes to hit the valuation numbers that have been publicized.Looking Ahead: Facebook Growth or Twitter Struggles?With the above in mind, our expectation is that Snap, going forward, will experience a user growth profile more akin to Twitter's than to Facebook's.While growth will be sustained by its continued popularity in the United States, competition from Facebook, Instagram andother international competitorswill continue to limit Snap's growth internationally.Our base case expectation is therefore for an average of 14.1% growth per year post-IPO, almost right in between Facebook's and Twitter's annual average growth rates of 19.1% and 10.3%, respectively (table 2). The primary source of the growth premium to Twitter derives from Snapchat's ability to innovate on product features better than Twitter (more on this below).ARPU Growth: Solid Start with Ample Upside RemainingWhilst the above DAU estimates are nothing for investors to get excited about, and fall largely in line with most market commentary, stopping one's analysis at DAU performance is shortsighted. In particular, it misses the key other side of the coin: ARPU. And when it comes to ARPU growth, we see a radically different story. Our view is that Snapchat will see strong ARPU growth going forward, driven by the following factors:A more monetization-friendly productA more advantageous position with a key user demographicA generally more monetization-focused management mindsetAll of these will in turn be boosted by general underlying strength in the mobile advertising space. We look at these in turn.Snapchat is a very monetization-friendly productOne of the most attractive features of Snapchat from an ARPU standpoint is that the product itself appears to lend itself very well, arguably better than its competitors, to monetization. The effectiveness of the platform is largely driven by Snap's ability to innovate on product features and stay ahead of the competition, and this has allowed Snap to build impressively strong positions in image sharing and in video.Looking first at image sharing, Snap has caught up rapidly with its competitors (chart 11) largely thanks to its ability to innovate with the format (initially with disappearing messages, later with filters, Stories, etc.). The implication of this is significant in that it has allowed Snap to lead the industry in terms of developing and delivering sponsored / branded content for this type of format. For instance, focusing on sponsored filters, Snap's ability to reach a large audience far exceeds Facebook despite its significantly smaller user base (chart 12).The growth in image sharing and the innovation surrounding its product features has positioned Snap favorably amongst advertisers, allowing Snap to strike important partnerships with verysignificant brandsworldwide. One of the examples of such campaigns that Snap highlightsin its S1relates to how Wendy's blanketed its U.S. stores with Sponsored Geofilters that promoted the Jalapeño Fresco Chicken Sandwich. Snap's measurement tool reported that the Sponsored Geofilter drove over 42,000 incremental people to a Wendy's location within seven days of viewing the Sponsored Geofilter.Perhaps more important than image sharing, Snap has developed a dominant position in video, converting it into aserious threat to Facebook. According to theKCPB presentation, as of Q1 16 Snap has surpassed Facebook in terms of daily video views despite its significantly smaller user base (chart 13).This success to date has been driven by Snap's unique approach to the video format. KCPB refers to Snaps approach as ""3V Advertising"": (1) Vertical - made for mobile viewing, (2) Video - a great way to tell a story, (3) Viewing - always full screen.The combination of these three has made video advertising that much more effective on Snapchat. In fact, according to the KCPB presentation, outside of Snapchat many video ads are ineffective with 81% of people muting the ads. However, Snap points out in its S-1 that on average, 60% of all Snap Ads are watched with the sound on.The above again points to Snap's effectiveness as a monetization platform as well as the management team's ability to keep innovating on product and stay ahead of the curve when it comes to marrying fun and engaging product features with monetization avenues. Arecent exampleof success with video would beGatorade's sponsored lens during the Super Bowl, a campaign which led to 60 million plays in total, 165 million views and an increase of 8 points in purchase intent.Snap has developed the ultimate trifecta - a robust advertising platform that combines communications (chatting), image creation and sharing, and video content. This has lead to numerous marketing campaigns achieving above average industry impact, performance and ROI. This should support rapid growth of ARPU as more marketers recognize these benefits and decide to move advertising dollars over to Snap.Snap is very strong with a key user demographicAs the pool of mobile advertising investment dollars rises, more advertisers are looking to target Millennials and younger demographics. In 2015, Marketers dedicatedover a third (34%) of their annual marketing budgetsto targeting these groups. That figure was likely even greater with teens and ""tweens"" included.The above phenomenon is largely because Millennials are expected to drive consumer spending in the years to come. Millennials are80 million strong, the largest demographic in the United States, andas of March 2015, also the largest demographic in the workforce.This of course translates into huge spending power. Estimates indicate Millennials could be spending$1.4 trillion annually by 2020and could inherit as much as $30 billion in the coming years. Even teens and tweens are generating significant spending power,spending as much as Baby Boomersin 2015.The issue advertisers face is that Millennials are moving away from traditional advertising channels to their phones (chart 14). Companies like Snap, as well as its competitors, provide an optimal channel through which to target these groups.Fortunately for Snap, they seem to have developed a very strong position in these age-groups. With 63% of Snap users in the 18-34 age category, and 22% between 13-17 years of age, Snap has captured the attention of a highly coveted marketing demographic (chart 15 - note: chart is from a 2016 comScore report, as such the data does not perfectly tie with Snap's latest demographics reported in its S-1).More importantly, Snap has become a leading platform in terms of its engagement within 18-34 age demographic (chart 16). Facebook is clearly a dominant player with massive reach and significant engagement, but Snapchat is the second leading platform in terms of average monthly minutes per visitor. As Snap continues to expand its reach and further penetrate this key age group, Snap should move higher and further to the right on this chart as it continues to threaten Facebook's leadership.This all bodes very well for Snap. The company has continued to rapidly expand its reach within the 18-24 category while also broadening its penetration within older age groups. As of December 2015, according to comScore, more than three-out-of-five 18-24 year olds now actively use Snapchat, with older age groups also on the rise (chart 17).With a dominance in the Millennial, Teen and Tween demographics, the second leading platform in terms of monthly engagement and further expansion of its reach within each of those key demographics Snap should receive an outsized portion of advertising dollars going forward. This should support rapid ARPU expansion in the coming years.Snap management is more monetization focusedPutting the above two tactical points aside, the most encouraging thing about Snap is that management has consistently shown a greater predisposition and knack for converting fun new product features into monetization avenues. In short: Snap management appears to be excellent at monetization.And the results bear this out. When comparing to Facebook and Twitter, Snap started monetizing earlier, and has grown faster in terms of ARPU than both of its comparables, despite being several years ""younger"" as a company (charts 18 and 19).Admittedly, claiming that Snap is simply better at monetizing than its comps is a subjective and difficult-to-prove assertion. However, if you believe this, then what makes this an even more interesting point is when you consider how much upside could still be left for Snap to capture. To this end, a simple side-by-side comparison of ARPU numbers with Facebook and Twitter suggests that Snap's ARPU could rise as much as 7x what it is today (chart 20).For us, Snap's impressive historical performance in ARPU driven by its clear ability to innovate in product and monetization, combined with the tremendous upside still there for the taking, points to strong and rapid catch-up in terms of ARPU in the years to come. It is therefore not surprising to us that after havingfailed to acquireSnapchat, Facebook has now reverted toreplicating its features consistently.Overall Industry Growth will keep supporting Snap ARPU GrowthAside from the intrinsic strengths of Snap as a company, it's also obvious that overall underlying industry strength will help sustain ARPU growth in the coming years (although the extent to which this will be remains a question).According to areport from IDC, ad spending is expected to grow from $652 billion in 2016 to $767 billion in 2020 with mobile specific spending growing 3x from $66 billion in 2016 to $196 billion in 2020. Social media marketing in particular is expected to grow 20% per year to $50.2bn in 2019,comfortably overtakingnewspaper advertising by 2020.Moreover,according to KPCB, there is a $22bn market opportunity in mobile advertising as it is the only growing outlet in terms of percent of consumption time. This should continue to encourage marketers to shift away from more legacy outlets like TV and print and into mobile (chart 21). Given that Snap's entire advertising inventory is on mobile, a growing pool of total mobile advertising dollars will certainly benefit Snap going forward.Rabbit from a hat: Ancillary product launches may add further upside to ARPUFor further revenue upside one can't overlook Snap's potential to develop ancillary products.Snap has already demonstrated a willingness to explore new product categories with the launch of Spectacles in September 2016, its first ever hardware product. New product developments outside of software could potentially provide Snap with a very interesting monetization model that is different from their competitors (FB is exploring VR) and a unique way of owning more of the user's share of mind.Spectacles are wearable glasses with a built-in camera that links seamlessly to a smartphone to create unique Snaps from a ""human perspective."" The company views Spectacles as an extension of Snapchat and intends to use the glasses to create a unique circular format for video as opposed to the standard rectangular viewing perspective (once again reinventing the standard video delivery model).Spectacles do generate revenue for Snap, but for 2016 the revenues were not material and, thus, not reported in the company's filing. Going forward, Spectacles could represent a much larger portion of Snap's revenue.It's unclear what other types of new products Snap is planning to bring to market, but Snap has demonstrated a strong ability to create innovative and sticky products that drive incremental user growth and revenue (chart 22). Expect each new product introduction to be strategic in driving user growth, enhancing user engagement, and increasing share of mind, all things that should bring create even greater revenue opportunities for Snap.ARPU Growth Going Forward: A Monetization MachineLooking ahead and given all of the above, our expectation is that despite slowing user growth, Snap's platform should support very strong ARPU growth going forward. We see Snap's ARPU catching up with Facebook's in the next five years, and it would not surprise us if it surpasses it further out. In other words, despite Twitter-like user growth, Snap is likely to experience more of a Facebook-like, if not better, ARPU growth profile.The biggest risk to this scenario playing out mainly relates to Facebook and other competitors' ability to replicate Snap's features both quickly and effectively. Should this be the case, Snap's leadership in product innovation will likely fail to spill over into significant ARPU growth. However, should competitors struggle to play the ""catch-up game"" well enough, Snap will likely see ARPU growth rates in line with what we predict below. The latter has been interestingly described as the ""Gingerbread strategy"" inthis article.With that in mind we anticipate two possible ARPU growth trajectories. Our downside case projections are more in line with other commentaries and essentially consider the latter scenario of product innovation followed by effective catch-up by competitors. The base case is instead predicated on management's ability to keep innovating on product, and competitors' relative ineffectiveness at copying such features.The numbers of both cases are displayed in table 3 below, but the highlight is that in our base case projections, we anticipate north of 50% CAGR over the next five years, with ARPU catching up to Facebook's 2016 numbers by 2019/2020.Putting This All Together: What is Snap worth?With all of the above in mind, we can now proceed to calculating our estimated valuation for Snap. We first look at what Snap's revenues will look like going forward, based on our DAU and ARPU assumptions outlined above, and then move into a valuation analysis using these revenue estimates.Financial ForecastsOur financial forecasts are summarized in Table 4, but the headline numbers we want to highlight are the following:DAU growth in between Twitter and Facebook's post-IPO   performance, reaching 246 million DAUs by 2019Strong ARPU catch-up and growth, reaching $6.88 per user by   2019, nearly equaling Facebook's current 2016 ARPU numbers, in   the Base CaseMore limited ARPU growth in the Downside Case, reaching $4.80   by 2019, in line with Twitter's current ARPU numbersTotal Revenues of $1.6 billion and $3.8 billion achieved in   2017 and 2018, respectively, in the Base CaseTotal Revenues of $1.3 billion and $2.7billion achieved in   2017 and 2018, respectively, in the Downside CaseValuationWe value Snap on an EV / Revenue basis using a target multiple range of 6.0x to 10.0x derived from the midpoint of the range between Facebook and Twitter current trading multiples. On the one hand, Snap's more limited DAU growth warrants a lower multiple than Facebook's, but on the other hand its more favourable ARPU prospects warrant a premium to Twitter's multiple. We apply these multiple to forward 2018 revenue estimates to account for Snap being a younger company than both of its comps. Our valuation estimates are summarised in Table 5 below, but the key takeaways are as follows:Despite limited DAU growth, our base case ARPU assumptions   imply a valuation of c. $30bn based off a 8.0x multiple on 2018   forward revenue estimatesIn our bearish case, we come out at $22bn on 2018 forward   revenue estimates, in line but still slightly above more recent   price targets.Overall, we see strong upside potential for Snap going   forward, with the valuation potentially rising to nearly $50bn   assuming greater maturity of their comps justifies using Snap's   2019 forward revenue estimates for the valuation, concluding that   this stock is a buy.Snap: Twitter growth, but Facebook ARPUIn many respects, one could say that the Snap IPO heralds a more general shift in social media platforms from building for user growth to building for user engagement and monetization. Since inception, Snap has always felt more like a blend between a traditional social media app and a gaming app. The more playful nature of the platform has in turn translated positively into monetization and ARPU growth, far more so than Snap's peers did at their equivalent stages of their lifecycle. Whether a purposeful management strategy or not, Snap seems better built for monetization.This of course is occurring concurrently with an increasing shift in advertising spend from traditional media outlets to online/digital and particular mobile channels. In many ways, it feels like advertisers are reaching the tipping point of shifting a majority of their dollars to social media and ""new media"" channels.As a result, we view Snap's future financial prospects very favorably, and per our analysis above, conclude that Snap is a buy. Snap's value is a function of being the first social media platform that has been built with advertisers in mind from the beginning.This opinion article is for informational purposes only, and   does not constitute investment advice.

Why Was This Analyst So Wrong About Twitter Inc?;2/28/2017;"Sometimes going against the grain with a contrarian view pays   off for Wall Street analysts. Other times, it blows up in their   faces and hurts investors who took their advice. The latter   recently happened to BTIG Research analyst Richard Greenfield,   who boldly upgradedTwitter(NYSE:TWTR) from  Neutral to Buy with a price target of $25 -- right   before the social network's dismal fourth quarter earningssank the stock.All analysts and investors eventually make bad calls, but   Greenfield's upgrade raised eyebrows, since it clearly went   against the popular view that Twitter was stuck in a terminal   decline. Let's take a look at why Greenfield believed that   Twitter could make a comeback, and why those bullish ideas might   be misguided.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();Why did BTIG believe in Twitter?Greenfield believed that several catalysts would help Twitter   recover. First, he saw a ""meaningful uptick"" in downloads of the   iOS app, which he attributed to the U.S. election and President   Trump's widely covered use of the platform. Second, he noted that   a recent CivicScience survey showed an increase in the app's   daily active users (DAUs). Greenfield cited those two factors as   evidence of higher user engagement.As user growth and engagement rebound, Greenfield believes   that advertisers and potential suitors could return. The analyst   doesn't ""expect immediate financial benefits"" in the first half   of the year, but believes that Twitter's ""second half 2017   revenues could exceed investors' expectations with 2018 well   above consensus.""Why were those ideas misguided?Greenfield's claim that iOS downloads were rising is true.   According to App Annie, Twitter's iOS rank in the U.S. surged   from  33th to 8th place between Feb. 29, 2016 and Jan. 20,   2017. Unfortunately, that growth quickly reversed after Trump's   inauguration, and the app slipped back to 26th place at the end   of February.Greenfield's claim that DAUs are rising was also confirmed in   Twitter's earnings report, which revealed that its DAUs rose 11%   annually during the quarter -- an acceleration from 7% growth in   the third quarter, 5% growth in the second quarter, and 3% growth   in the first quarter. However, Twitter left out one crucial   number -- the actual number of DAUs.That figure matters because Twitter's monthly active users   (MAUs) only rose 4% annually to 319 million during the quarter.   If Twitter's DAU growth is outpacing its MAU growth, it means a   small group of power users are tweeting more frequently, but the   platform still isn't reeling in casual users. Twitter also hasn't   made it easy for casual users to get started, since it still   hasn't adequately addressedcommon complaintslike its 140-character limit, non-threaded replies, and the   proliferation of fake and spam accounts -- all of which make   user-to-user interactions difficult.Why advertisers and potential buyers aren't coming     backSome of the company's decisions over the last few years have   set it up for an uphill battle in winning back advertisers and   potential acquirers.First, former CEO Dick Costolo pivoted Twitter toward a ""cost   per engagement"" model which let advertisers pay for only the   interactions (tweets, likes, retweets) that they wanted.At the time, Costolo believed that move would help it reach   smaller businesses with limited advertising budgets. Instead, the   move backfired and  allowed large customers to pay less   money for fewer clicks. Twitter still hasn't recovered from that   move -- that's probably why its core advertising revenues fell   0.5% annually last quarter.As for a buyout, CEO Jack Dorsey and previous suitors seem to   have abandoned the idea. In January,Alphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Googleagreed to buymost of Twitter's developer products for an undisclosed sum. That   sale indicates that Twitter could sell off non-core businesses to   generate fresh cash -- which might be attractive to companies   like Google, which value Twitter's tech but don't want its   stalled out user base, sluggish advertising business, and   controversies regarding bullying, trolling, and illegal accounts.   Dorsey'srecent purchaseof $7 million in shares also indicates that the co-founder   believes in  Twitter's long-term future -- which might mean   that a buyout is off the table.Beating estimates in 2017 and 2018 might not     matterLastly, Greenfield's suggestion that Twitter could beat   expectations in 2017 and 2018 isn't as bullish as it sounds.   Analysts expect Twitter's revenue to fall 6.4% this year and    rebound 7.5% next year -- indicating that Twitter's 2018   revenue will remain nearly flat from 2016 levels. Beating those   estimates won't put Twitter back on the track to higher   growth.Greenfield might believe that time will eventually prove his   thesis right. However, Twitter's slumping sales growth, the   sluggish evolution of its platform, and a CEO that splits his   time between two companies all indicate that things could get   much worse before they get better.10 stocks we like better than TwitterWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Better Buy: Facebook Inc vs. Netflix, Inc.;2/28/2017;"These two are in rare company. How many other organizations   have ruled the age of the internet quite likeFacebook(NASDAQ: FB) orNetflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) ? We spend countless hours on each site keeping up   with friends and binge-watching our favorite shows.In fact, with the addition ofAlphabetandAmazon, I think we'd be hard-pressed to find more influential companies   in today's society. That fact has not been lost on   investors. Over the past four years, both stocks have quintupled   in value.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();But which is a better buy today? That's a difficult question   to answer, though we can get a better understanding for what   we're buying by looking at the question through three different   lenses.Sustainable competitive advantagesIf I had one word of advice for beginning investors, it would   be this: Spend the bulk of your time investigating a company's   sustainable competitive advantages. Often referred to as a ""moat""   by investors, sustainable competitive advantages are what keep   customers coming back for more every year and consistently keep   the competition at bay.Netflix benefits from, as I see it, three different types of   moats. The first is the brand. The Qwikster fiasco not   withstanding, the company has won over legions of loyal customers   who appreciate the service and its original content. That   original content is key, as it is gets people hooked into the   Netflix ecosystem.Management is able to target its original content because it   has more data on our viewing habits than any other organization   in the history of the world. That also gives the company the   upper hand when it comes to paying for content from third-party   providers. Imagine the negotiating table: Netflix knows just how   popular certain shows are to its viewers and how valuable it is.   The other side has no idea. That asymmetry provides pricing   power.Image source: Getty Images.Finally, Netflix benefits from a sneaky type of moat I onlyrecentlycame to appreciate. Once customers sign on, the cost of the   monthly plan is so low -- and the payments fully automated --   that a user would have to be highly motivated tocancelhis/her membership.Facebook, on the other hand, benefits from one of the most   powerful moats in the world: the network effect. With each   additional member who joins Facebook, non-members are   incentivized to join as a way of keeping up with their friends   and family. It's a virtuous cycle that is in full effect. Even   though the company already has over 1billiondaily active users, its roster continues to grow -- up 18% year   over year.Not only that but Facebook gets essentially all of its content   for free. That's often underappreciated by investors. Imagine   what a boon it would be if Netflix never had to pay for its   shows.At the end of the day, both of these companies have powerful   moats. In years past, I would have given the nod to Facebook. But   my realization of how easy it is for Netflix to keep subscribers   -- and how effective original content is at bringing in new users   -- is enough to call this a draw.Winner = TieFinancial fortitudeWhile conservative investors love seeing cash returned to them   via dividends and more aggressive investors love seeing cash   reinvested in a company's growth prospects, there's something to   be said for cash.Every company will experience difficult financial times, and   the companies that enter those phases with lots of cash will   prosper. They will have the flexibility to outspend rivals and   gain market share, repurchase stock on the cheap, and even make   strategic acquisitions. Debt-laden companies will be in the   opposite boat, forced to satisfy the whims of their   creditors.CompanyCashDebtNet IncomeFree Cash FlowNetflix$1.7 billion$3.4 billion$0.2 billion($1.6 billion)Facebook$30 billion$0$10.2 billion$11.6 billionData source: Yahoo! Finance. Cash includes cash, short, and   long-term investments.Here, we have a very clear winner. Netflix is spending lots of   cash on its international expansion and original programing.   That's a great strategy because, as mentioned above, once   customers are locked in, they're a reliable source of recurring   revenue.But with that strategy comes financial fragility. Netflix is   free cash flow negative, while Facebook is a cash machine with no   long-term debt whatsoever.Winner = FacebookValuationFinally, we have valuation. While this isn't an exact science,   there are some straightforward metrics we can consult to give us   an idea of how expensive each stock is.CompanyP/EP/FCFPEG RatioNetflix340N/A1.6Facebook32341.1Data source: SEC filings, E*Trade. P/E represents figures from   non-GAAP earnings.Here again, we have a clear winner. Because of the   aforementioned spending, Netflix isveryexpensive based on traditional metrics.Facebook, on the other hand, looks like a pretty good deal at   today's prices. While a P/E of 32 would never be described as   ""cheap,"" the company increased earnings by 86% last year, and is   expected to grow by 28% moving forward.Winner = FacebookThe winner is...So there you have it: While both companies have powerful   moats, Facebook has a better balance sheet and appears to be a   better value at today's prices. You really can't go wrong by   investing in either, but I'm a much stronger fan of Facebook at   today's levels. That helps explain why it accounts for 14% of my   real-life holdings, while Netflix clocks in at just 2%.10 stocks we like better than FacebookWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Facebook Inc's Chatbots Hit a 70% Failure Rate;2/28/2017;"Facebook(NASDAQ: FB) is reportedly scaling back its chatbot efforts on   Messenger after the programs failed to fulfill 70% of users'   requests.The Informationreports that those requests couldn't be handled without human   agents, and bots built by outside developers ""had issues"" because   the ""technology to understand human requests wasn't developed   enough.""So instead of building a large ecosystem of chatbots, Facebook   will train Messenger bots to handle ""a narrower set of cases, so   users aren't disappointed by the limitations of automation.""   Let's see what this strategic shift means for Facebook's AI   efforts, and whether or not chatbots will ever become meaningful   tools for the social network.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();Understanding Facebook's AI strategyArtificial intelligence plays a vital role in helping Facebook   track users and deliver targeted ads. By using AI to scan a   user's status updates, photos, videos, check-ins, likes, linked   apps, and other data, Facebook generates digital profiles of   users which help it deliver targeted ads to their News Feeds. In   2013, Facebook launched the FAIR (Facebook Artificial   Intelligence Research) unit to continuously upgrade those AI   capabilities.That's where Messenger comes in. In 2014, Facebook forced   users to download the stand-alone Messenger app to keep chatting.   That move -- whichclearly mirroredTencent's(NASDAQOTH: TCEHY) WeChat -- laid the foundations for Messenger   to become a ""platform"" which could eventually offer ride hailing,   mobile payments, deliveries, games and other services from a   single app.Facebook's Messenger app. Image source: Google Play.That move would give Facebook an ""OS within an OS"" to counter   the iOS App Store andAlphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google Play. Facebook's next   step would be toreplaceapps with Messenger chatbots, which were introduced last April.   If that effort works, it could turn the entire mobile app store   model upside down.The premature rise of the chatbotsIn theory, a business chatbot could answer questions, make   purchase suggestions, process orders, and send shipping updates   to customers. For customers, having ""conversations"" with these   bots would feel more natural than scrolling and clicking through   a mobile app. Companies could  also cut costs by reducing   the number of human customer service representatives.Facebook tethers those bots to Messenger for Business, which   provides a live customer service chat channel for a large number   of businesses. Businesses can choose to put a human or a chatbot   to handle queries on their end. This idea attracted a lot of   early adopters -- 30,000 Facebook bots were already active on   Messenger as of last September.But just as Google struggled with low-quality apps over the   years, Facebook's ecosystem quickly became bogged down with   poorly produced chatbots. Badly made bots could annoy customers   and tarnish a company's image -- so the company decided it's a   better idea to send the bots back to the drawing board than   expand the overall ecosystem.Facebook should've seen this comingThe limitations of AI-powered bots were already clear when   Facebook launched its chatbot APIs last year. For example,Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) launched its chatbot Tay onTwitteras an experimentlast March. Within 24 hours, Tay started tweeting racist and   sexist comments, forcing Microsoft to abruptly pull the plug and   issue an  apology. Tencent has also struggled to  purge   spam and scam bots on WeChat since it started letting millions of   accounts create their own bots.Facebook's AI tech also wasn't that impressive prior to the   arrival of its chatbots. Its News Feed struggled to discern fake   news headlines from real ones, and its Messenger-based virtual   assistant M hasn't gained much  ground against Google Now or   Siri.Edison Investment analyst Richard Windsor -- who    recently called Facebook a ""laggard in AI"" compared to   Google -- stated that ""when Facebook tries to automate its   systems, things always go wrong."" He also pointed out that while   Facebook has hired plenty of AI talent, it simply hasn't been   working on AI ""for nearly long enough"" to challenge market   leaders like Google.So what's next for Facebook's AI efforts?Despite those missteps, Facebook probably won't stop investing   in chatbots anytime soon. The company is expected to introduce   new AI plans at its F8 conference in April, which will likely   include ways to boost the quality, not quantity, of its Messenger   bots. It could also introduce more ways to tether bots into other   Messenger features -- like payments and games -- to increase the   app's appeal as a stand-alone platform.10 stocks we like better than FacebookWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Alphabet Suing Uber Over Self-Driving Car Technology;2/28/2017;"Uber badly needed self-driving car technology because it was in danger of getting pushed out of the market if many cheaper ride-hailing services using self-driving technology (no human driver) were to enter the market. So it assumed a not-so-honest way of getting it. That's what AlphabetGOOGLis claiming after discovering the theft of its technology by a former Googler.The Technology in QuestionGoogle has for long held that its technology, which includes hardware and software components, is superior to others. The company, which originally used LiDAR based systems from Velodyne, later developed a number of such systems for close-range, mid-range and long-range ""vision"" of self-driving cars. These systems generate millions of laser images per second that offer a much clearer picture of the area surrounding the car and helps it take more accurate decisions.Additionally, the company recently announced that it had devised a more economical system that would take its cost from $75,000, to $7,500, thus making it commercially viable.The AccusedAnthony Levandowskihas been accused of downloading 14,000 highly confidential files (9.7GB of data), including Waymo's LiDAR circuit board designs to an external disk drive using specialized software. He then downloaded a new OS to his company-supplied laptop that effectively deleted information, in a rather elaborate attempt to erase his activity. Strangely, Levandowski didn't use the laptop much after the new OS was installed.After quitting Google, Levandowski set up a self-driving trucking company calledOtto, wooing fifteen other Waymo engineers, who brought additional supplier lists, manufacturing details and other trade secrets.Otto quickly sold itself toUberfor $680 million.Uber's ResponseUber remains partners with Google for other technology despite their increased competition on the self-driving front. As an initial response, a Uber representative said, ""We take the allegations made against Otto and Uber employees seriously and we will review this matter carefully.""Later, this changed to: ""We are incredibly proud of the progress that our team has made… We have reviewed Waymo's claims and determined them to be a baseless attempt to slow down a competitor and we look forward to vigorously defending against them in court. In the meantime, we will continue our hard work to bring self-driving benefits to the world.""Other DetailsThe discovery of theft was intriguing: A Uber supplier had inadvertently copied a Google executive in a mail titled ""Otto files."" The mail was being sent to people at Uber that Google thinks were involved with Uber's self-driving technology.Google found that the replicated technology, the diagrams of which were attached to the email, bore a close resemblance to its proprietary technology and was based on Waymo trade secrets. ""Moreover, the Replicated Board is specifically designed to be used in conjunction with many other Waymo trade secrets and in the context of overall LiDAR systems covered by Waymo patents,"" the complaint reads.Upon inquiry with the Nevada Governor's Office of Economic Development and Department of Motor Vehicles, it was found that Uber said its technology was internally developed.The Big PictureAs a Bloomberg report points out, Levandowski didn't start out at Google. He has been working on autonomous vehicles for some time, founding a startup called 510 systems in 2001 that he later sold to Google. The technology this startup brought is the foundation of Google's technology.At the end of the day, engineers do like to move around because it's more profitable and allows them liberties that aren't available for sticking around at a big corporate house like Google. This is neither the first nor last time companies have whisked away people from competitors. All the major tech companies including Google itself, MicrosoftMSFT, FacebookFB, TwitterTWTR, AppleAAPL, you name it, have done likewise.Engineers are the life blood of companies like Google while on the other hand, the big companies are the only ones that can make engineers rich.

Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) a Whale of a Trade? Go Long Buffett!;2/28/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) is in the middle of a breakout. While it was a surprise to many, we profited from seeing it coming. Just recently, I wrote several strategies to go long AAPL stock, and they have all paid well and without trouble.makeArticleAd();Source:Beni Krausz via UnsplashTwelve days ago, I wrote about how you canprofit from owning AAPL or trading it. This was in addition to last month's $5 profit per contract out of thin air trading Apple stock when ithad appeared to be too late.Today, I want to repeat the success I've had trading AAPL stock long. But this time I am doing it in a smaller account, so I will use credit put spreads instead of selling naked puts.How to Trade AAPL StockThe Bet:Sell the AAPL Oct $110/$105 credit put spread. This is a bullish trade for which I collect 55 cents per contract to open. The 20% buffer from current price gives me a 90% theoretical chance of success. If Apple shares stay above $110 per share, the trade will yield 12% on money risk.The 10 Best Stock Charts on Wall Street Right NowUsually I like to balance my trades by selling opposite bearish risk, but in this case I will refrain. I will count on the Warren Buffett effect that long-term AAPL is a hold. Buyers should step in on down weeks and defend the stock for me.I could sell credit call spreads in thePowerShares QQQ Trust, Series 1 (ETF)(NASDAQ:QQQ) to create some balance, but I don't feel it's necessary at this time.Earlier, I noted that I like selling naked puts in sure things like AAPL andAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL).So I will offer the trade, but I only do this if I am willing and able to own the stock at the strike sold.The Alternate:Sell the AAPL Oct $105 put naked. This is a bullish trade for which I collect $1.25 per contract to open. My breakeven point is $103.75 per share. Anything lower would accrue losses for me.If AAPL stock falls below my sold strike, I would be put the stock at that price even if it's much lower. Therein lies the open-ended risk unlike that of a credit put spread.I am not required to hold trades through expiration.

Alphabet’s Waymo Leads the Field in Driverless Cars;2/28/2017;"Image Source: WaymoAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) has been crushing its rivals in   self-driving cars, according to the latest data from the   California Department of Motor Vehicles. Alphabet's driverless   car division -- Waymo -- reported the lowest disengagement rate   among all the companies testing self-driving cars on California   roads last year, meaning there were fewer times when the   autonomous driving system had to be shut down.makeArticleAd();How things lookThe California DMV defines disengagement as either a failure   of autonomous technology or the requirement of human intervention   to switch off the autonomous mode. A lower disengagement rate   indicates that Waymo's driverless cars have become better at   driving themselves.In fact, according to this data, Waymo is not just better than   the rest; it is beating its rivals by a huge margin as its cars   had a meager disengagement rate of 0.20 per 1,000 autonomous   miles. This is down from the 0.80 disengagement rate in 2015.   This seems even more impressive in light of the fact that Waymo   vehicles covered longer distances than rivals and, asTechcnrunchreports, Waymo's autonomous vehicles and their engineers are set   to err on the side of caution when deciding to disengage.ManufacturerAutonomous miles driven in 2016DisengagementsDisengagement per 1,000 milesBMW63811.6Waymo635,8681240.2Ford59035.1Nissan4,099286.8Mercedes-Benz673183271.9Tesla550183332.7Data Source: California DMVA low disengagement rate and more miles driven indicate that   Alphabet's moonshot self-driving technology is the most   successful on California roads. More importantly, the lower   disengagement rate has been accomplished mostly in suburban and   city driving conditions. Waymo, therefore, seems to be closer   than any other company to launching its self-driving project   commercially.This is not surprising as Alphabet (then Google) began working   on driverless cars in 2009 and has the first-mover advantage.   Since then, its autonomous cars have driven over 2 million miles,   with most of the driving taking place on city streets.   Additionally, Waymo clocked 1 billion miles on the simulator last   year.The amount of time and effort put in by Alphabet's Waymo into   the self-driving car project has placed it way ahead of the curve   in autonomous driving. This might eventually turn Waymo's   driverless rivals into potential clients if they are unable to   replicate the success of its driverless tech.Waymo's rivals could start using its     technologyWaymo calls itself a self-driving technology company, not a   car company. It currently uses a Lexus vehicle and a prototype of   its own to test its driverless technology, while it is also plans   to add 100 Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid minivans to the fleet.Image Source: WaymoIt is less likely that Alphabet will manufacture cars of its   own as it seems to have charted out a different go-to-market   strategy. In January, Waymo announced that it will start   manufacturing sensors used in driverless cars in-house to   integrate its hardware and software development. This integration   should give Waymo a cost advantage and lead to stronger adoption   of its driverless technology.In fact, Waymo has reduced the cost to build a Lidar sensor --   the most crucial part of a driverless car as it uses lasers to   generate maps of the car's surroundings -- by 90%. The price of a   Lidar sensor was $75,000 in 2009, but it costs just $7,500 now.   The integration of hardware and software under a single roof will   allow Waymo to deliver seamless self-driving performance to   potential customers as it is developing its sensors in   association with machine learning experts.As automakers can get turnkey self-driving solutions under a   single roof, they will start turning to Waymo to power their   self-driving cars.Fiat Chrysler Automobiles(NYSE: FCAU) is the first such example.In May last year, Fiat Chrysler and Alphabet's Waymo struck a   deal to develop 100 self-driving cars based on the Pacifica   Hybrid minivan. This was Waymo's first deal with an automaker to   supply its driverless technology. Last month, it was reported   that both companies are going to double down on their efforts as   Alphabet could add another 100 Pacifica Hybrid minivans to the   Waymo fleet this year.ABloombergreport says Alphabet is in talks with Fiat Chrysler to start a   ride-sharing service with the minivans. If that's true, it would   indicate that Waymo is finally taking steps to monetize its   driverless technology.Honda(NYSE: HMC) , meanwhile, could be Waymo's next partner.Both companies were in negotiations last December to put   Waymo's technology into Honda's vehicles. A partnership could   alter Honda's approach to developing its own driverless cars. The   Japanese automaker initially wanted to get its self-driving cars   onto highways by 2020, but Waymo could help it go a few steps   further by adding city and suburban driving capabilities. A Honda   press release says:Honda previously announced its intention to put production     vehicles with automated driving capabilities on highways     sometime around 2020 related to its goal of a collision-free     society. In addition to these on-going efforts, this technical     collaboration with Waymo could allow Honda R&D to explore a     different technological approach to bring fully self-driving     technology to market. These discussions are an initial step     that will allow Waymo and Honda R&D to further explore the     potential of a broad range of automated driving     technologies.The takeawayThe latest California data clearly indicate that Alphabet's   Waymo has a far better driverless technology than any of its   rivals. Waymo is using this to its advantage by partnering with   automakers and showing them the strengths of its self-driving   technology. This strategy of advertising its superiority in this   space is a smart one as it can help Waymo win over potential   clients, making it a key player in the driverless car supply   chain.10 stocks we like better than Alphabet (A       shares)When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock       tip, it can pay to listen.

Get Paid to Trade International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) Stock;2/27/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsI have not been a fan ofInternational Business Machines Corp.(NYSE:IBM) for a long time. It is my opinion that management was slow to shift cash cows. They lost their way and have yet to recover. They have been trying to carve a niche in artificial intelligence, but that story has been over a decade in the making. To use a poker term, they are pot-committed to AI.makeArticleAd();Luckily, artificial intelligence has seen a recent resurgence in popularity so the wait may actually pay off to IBM longs.Experts are in awe of what Watson can do. Unfortunately, its profit stream is taking too long to develop. IBM is no longer the sure long-term bet it once was. To me, it more resembles a startup with a cool product still finding its way.Click to EnlargeUsually, I like to sell longer-dated risk in companies that I believe are long-term winners likeAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) orApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL). In this case, I am putting my trust in the IBM price action more so than its fundamentals.The Bet:Sell the IBM Oct $130 put. This is a bullish trade for which I collect $1.40 per contract to open. This trade has a 90% theoretical chance of success. This sounds like a great idea now, but it comes with risk. By selling the put naked, I am committing to buying the stock at $130 per share if IBM falls below it. Anything below $128.60 per share would accrue losses for me.The 7 Best ETFs for Retirement InvestorsSelling naked puts is not suited for most investors, so I can modify the trade to make it more attainable.The Alternate:Sell IBM $140/$135 credit put spread. This also is a bullish trade, but one with a finite risk profile. I collect 40 cents per contract to open. The 22% price buffer is smaller than that of selling the $130 naked put but for the finite risk profile advantage.While 40 cents may sound too little, it would represent an 8% yield on money risked and for the high chance of success it carries it should elate most investors.I chose longer-dated risk so I don't have to fret the short-term gyrations.

5 Reasons to Buy General Electric Company (GE) Stock;2/27/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsInvestors looking for a reasonably valued stock that is poised to benefit from the Trump presidency and the improvement of the global economy should buyGeneral Electric Company(NYSE:GE). From Trump's energy policy to his infrastructure plan to the better than expected economic performance of China, the U.S., and Europe, GE stock has a plethora of positive catalysts.makeArticleAd();Source:Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified)At the same time General Electric shares haven't really risen all that much since the election - for a few reasons - and their valuation is still reasonable.Positive Catalysts for GE StockTrump's Energy Policy:Newly elected President Donald Trump is a major proponent of opening more land to oil drilling and fracking.FollowingGE's proposed $7.4 billion purchaseof oil and gas services companyBaker Hughes Incorporated(NYSE:BHI), which made GE the world's second largest oilfield services company, the conglomerate is exceptionally well-positioned to benefit from Trump's energy policy.7 Best Stocks to Buy for a Donald Trump Green LightOf course, the combined GE oil & services-BHI entity - when it finally closes - is expected to be spun off as its own separately traded company, but anyone holding GE stock at the time should get a piece of that action, and thus will benefit regardless.And as the Trump administration opens more areas to drilling and fracking, energy companies will need more equipment, products and services from GE.Trump's Infrastructure Initiative:General Electric's large lighting unit should get a major boost from the president's upcoming infrastructure initiative. The public-private partnerships expected to be implemented by the plan could be used to expand""public lighting.""Moreover, other types of infrastructure - including new roads, bridges and tunnels - need lights that GE can and does provide.Trump's Infrastructure Initiative (Part 2):Of course, factories can be pretty large buildings, and large buildings usually require a great deal of lighting.With its significant industrial lighting business,General Electric also is poised to benefit from the president's well-publicized efforts to bring more factories to the U.S.Macroeconomic Trends:The European Union recently increased its 2017 economic growth forecastto 1.8%, up from 1.6% previously, as ""the EU's economic recovery is taking hold."" Meanwhile,China's GDP rose a better than expected 6.8%last quarter, and its economy appears to be stabilizing,while the U.S. economy is rapidly improving.With major operations in all three areas, General Electric should benefit from the improving economies in those areas. Many of GE's businesses, including transportation, aviation, lighting and oil and gas, are greatly impacted by economic growth trends.Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock Is Ryzen Above the CompetitionValuation:Unlike many stocks that are poised to get a boost from Trump's policies, GE stock is reasonably valued right now, as it hasn't gotten much of a boost since the November election. GE trades at a reasonable 16 times forward earnings projections, and it trades at just more than twice sales.Bottom Line on GE StockGeneral Electric sports a reasonable valuation and high leverage to the global economy and the Trump administration's policies.Couple those factors in with a 3.2% dividend yield at current prices, and GE stock looks like a quality addition at the moment.As of this writing, Larry Ramer did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace3 Stocks to Watch on Monday: Tesla Inc (TSLA), Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) and BlackBerry Ltd (BBRY)Valeant Pharmaceuticals Intl Inc (VRX) Q4 Earnings: What to ExpectThe 10 Best Stock Charts on Wall Street Right NowThe post5 Reasons to Buy General Electric Company (GE) Stockappeared first onInvestorPlace."

The Next Big Thing for Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN): Productivity Software;2/27/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) has taken on some unexpected targets lately. None more ambitious - and unforeseen - than sticking its Alexa personal assistant in the Amazon Echo smart speaker.makeArticleAd();Source: AmazonThat move has paid off with a big lead in the race to become the hub of the smart home, despite AMZN's complete lack of smartphone presence.Per a report inThe Information, Amazon is readying another bold move. If sources are correct, AMZN is preparing to take onMicrosoft Corporation's(NASDAQ:MSFT) Microsoft Office andAlphabet Inc.'s(NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google G Suite with its own cloud-based productivity suite.Report: Amazon.com Is Working on a Productivity SuiteThe Informationbroke the news that Amazon.com isworking on its own productivity suiteto take on Microsoft and Google. The website says AMZN's Amazon Web Services - AWS - unit has told some of its ""large corporate customers"" of its plans to offer a new suite of productivity apps that will compete against the two dominant players.7 REITs That Should Be CondemnedMicrosoft Office has always been considered a cash cow for the company. The productivity suite quickly became the industry standard, the applications of choice for enterprise, schools and home PC users. To make its software seem more affordable, to break free of the boom bust cycle between major versions of Microsoft Office, and to address the growing threat of Google's free Google Apps suite, five years ago, the company began pushing Office 365.This subscription version of Microsoft Office brought recurring monthly revenue and other advantages. Microsoft expanded into Office apps for mobile devices likeApple Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AAPL) iPad and began to sell online storage for Office 365 users, with OneDrive.Google Apps/G SuiteGoogle wasn't sitting still, though, refining Google Apps intoG Suite, a full-on competitor to Office 365, with paid monthly subscription plans and online storage options. The company has also leveraged Google Apps and its lightweight Chrome OS into Chromebooks - ultra-low-cost laptops that have been giving Microsoft fits, especially in the education market.That education market is where the potential for disruption is really playing out. With its free Google Apps and low-cost Chromebooks, Google upended the education market. By the end of 2015,more than half of all device in U.S. classrooms were Chromebooks. This has repercussions beyond the classroom, as those students turn into young professionals who are more comfortable with Google's productivity software than with Microsoft Office.I've seen the effect first hand. My kids do everything at school using G Suite, despite Microsoft offering free Office 365 subscriptions to students and computer labs full of Windows PCs. They ignore Microsoft Office and Apple's Pages/Numbers on our home computers, and instead log onto G Suite for doing homework.If Google could quickly make waves in one of Microsoft's key strongholds, why couldn't Amazon.com march in and disrupt both companies?Why Amazon Would Take On Microsoft OfficeThis is a key question. Taking on the Google and Apple in the smart home with the Amazon Echo made sense because the smart speaker was a Trojan horse. It offers a growing number of ""Skills"" that let it control other smart devices by voice command, or interact with online services.That ropes consumers into buying it. But Alexa is a voice-activated path to effortlessly order products directly from Amazon.com, and gives an incentive to buy other Amazon products and services like Amazon Music Unlimited and Amazon Fire TV.Where's the win for AMZN in offering productivity software, other than to tweak Microsoft and Google?For the answer, look to AWS. Amazon Web Servicesdominates the market for cloud infrastructureand the profit from this division is a big driver of Amazon's overall growth. Amazon already has the servers in place and it has several of the components needed for a productivity suite, including its WorkDocs and WorkMail apps and the recently announcedAmazon Chimevideo conferencing software. Stitch these together with a few additional components and Amazon could have its Microsoft Office and Google G Suite competitor.Google charges $5 to $10 per month for G Suite, while Microsoft Office 365 has several tiered options starting at $5.99 per month.AMZN could charge a competitive rate for its new offering, adding more subscription-based revenue to its bottom line while taking advantage of its existing cloud muscle. The base monthly fee could be supplemented by charging for additional online storage for enterprise customers - something it has plenty of.Productivity software could also become another free perk of Prime membership. Prime members that start using Amazon's productivity software could put pressure on their employers to invest in a subscription, in an effect like Google's approach that sees students graduate and look to their employers to provide G Suite access.The Dow Jones Industrial Average Keeps Rising, But a Correction Is ComingAMZN isn't commenting andThe Information'ssources say all of this is still in the early stages, but the move makes sense. Amazon has been aggressively expanding beyond its role as an online retailer, AWS has the infrastructure needed to support the initiative, the company has been creeping into enterprise software with apps like WorkMail, and Google proved that the Microsoft Office behemoth isn't invulnerable. A productivity software suite from Amazon.com could well be the company's next big thing.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace3 High-Impact Tech Earnings: Tesla, Fitbit and Square3 Dow Titans Buckling Under the PressureThe postThe Next Big Thing for Amazon.com, Inc.

Mobile World Congress: Apple Inc. (AAPL) vs. Everyone Else;2/27/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMobile World Congress is the industry's largest event for smartphone launches. Everyone who's anyone is there -unless your company name isApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL).makeArticleAd();Source: BlackBerryMWC 2017 officially started today, but the big announcements took place over the weekend.And in many ways, they set the stage for the coming battle for best smartphone that will pit Apple's 10th anniversary iPhone 8 andSamsung Electronics Co Ltd's(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) comeback Galaxy S8 against everyone else.Here's what you need to know aboutMWC 2017.Cutting Edge New SmartphonesMobile World Congress is the venue where many manufacturers choose to launch their new smartphones. That means the trends are set for what to expect in the coming year. At MWC 2017, there have been a few standouts that lead to some interesting conclusions.LG's new G6 smartphoneis one of the most talked about releases. The company abandoned the modular design it introduced in last year's G5. The new G6 incorporates design elements expected in the iPhone 8, with a glass front and back held together with a stainless-steel band.7 Best Stocks to Buy for a Donald Trump Green LightWhile bezels are still there, they're been minimized by moving the power button and fingerprint sensor to the back. The result is a 5.7-inch display in a compact body - and the display is wowing with its 564 ppi pixel density and support for HDR. The LG G6 also has a dual lens 13 megapixel camera, but unlike the iPhone 7 Plus, the extra lens is wide angle rather than telephone.Another interesting flagship release is theP10from China'sHuawei. This new premium smartphone includesLeica-branded cameras and a Portrait Mode to compete with iPhone 7 Plus feature. In addition, the P10 uses Huawei's own processor, the Kirin 960. This is bad news forQualcomm,Inc.(NASDAQ:QCOM), which is seeing more smartphone makers follow the lead of Apple by ditching the Snapdragon to develop their own customized chips.When the iPhone 8 arrives in the fall, its expected all-glass design isn't going to be as unique as Apple might have hoped. Cameras are going to be a big battleground, too, putting pressure on Apple to go further than it did with the dual-lens iPhone 7 Plus.No Galaxy S8 at MWC 2017Samsung traditionally unveils its new Galaxy S smartphones at Mobile World Congress. Not this year. Delayed by the Galaxy Note 7 battery investigation, Samsung is expected tounveil the Galaxy S8at an event on March 29.The company did take the wraps offtwo new tablets, though. The Galaxy Tab S3 and Galaxy Book. The latter is offered in two different sizes, runs Windows 10, comes with a snap-on keyboard case and stylus and is aimed atMicrosoft Corporation's(NASDAQ:MSFT) Surface Pro.Google Assistant Coming to Android Nougat and Marshmallow DevicesAlphabet Inc.(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) has had a big decision to make since introducing Google Assistant. The company broke with tradition to make its new AI-powered digital assistant exclusive to its own Google Pixel smartphones. But that restriction means the number of phones running Google Assistant are outnumbered by Siri-powered Apple devices andAmazon.com,Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AMZN) Alexa-powered smart speakers.Google chose MWC 2017 to announce it's decided to go back to the strategy of volume over exclusivity.Google Assistant will start rolling outto devices running Android Nougat and Marshmallow starting this week.BlackBerry and Nokia Makes a Splash at MWC 2017If you'd asked anyone a few months ago what companies would be generating buzz at MWC 2017, it's doubtful thatBlackBerry Ltd(NASDAQ:BBRY) orNokia Corp (ADR)(NYSE:NOK) would be anywhere on that list. But they both pulled it off. Sort of.BlackBerry's last hurrah in smartphones is the newBlackBerry KeyOne. The last phone with the company's name on it that was designed in-house combines Android with a classic BlackBerry keyboard. There's grumbling about the $549 price, but a general feeling that had BBRY releasedthisphone a few years ago, it might still be relevant in the smartphone space.The other big surprise was the return of the Nokia brand. Finland'sHMD Globalbought the rights to use the Nokia name on phones, and at MWC 2017 it announcedthree new Nokia Android smartphonesaimed at the Chinese market.The company is also bringing back the classic Nokia 3310 cell phone. Considered to be virtually indestructible, the Nokia 3310 was first released in 2000 andsold over 126 million units. The new version is a little less sturdy, but has new colors, and updated display and runs just over $50.Nokia gets some licensing revenue out of this, but was not involved in the development of the new phones bearing its brand.Everyone Against the iPhone 8The announcements from MWC 2017 largely set the stage for the coming battle for smartphone supremacy. Samsung still must take the wraps off the Galaxy S8, but after that happens, we'll largely know what Apple's iPhone 8 will be up against.Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA) Will Try to Dominate IndiaIt looks like Apple's 10th anniversary iPhone will face a strong field with large displays, impressive cameras, Google Assistant on board and new designs - at least some of which follow the direction Apple is expected to take.Who will have the best smartphone of 2017?

Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA) Will Try to Dominate India;2/27/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhile China's e-commerce market is still growing,Alibaba Group Holding Ltd(NYSE:BABA) and its affiliate Ant Financial are already looking south to India. Last year, Morgan Stanley predicted that theIndian e-commerce marketwould grow the fastest globally, to $119 billion by 2020. And Alibaba stock is poised to benefit.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockWhat's driving e-commerce and fintech in India? India passed the U.S. as the world's No. 2 smartphone market last year, with 220 million users . T he number of smartphone users in India is expected to balloon to 810 million by 2021 and India's 3G and 4G networks could cover 300 million subscribers by March 2018.India's young and growing population is increasingly tech-savvy, especially millennials.India's government also supports a cashless economy, seeing this as a way to reduce corruption and tax evasion. The Indian government alsoremoved the largest banknotes, 500 rupee and 1000 rupee notes, from the economy. This led to an explosion in the use ofmobile wallets in India, adding as many as  1 million users added per day .Last year, the National Payments Corporation of India announced theUnified Payment Interface, making it convenient for Indians to access their bank accounts on their phones and pay.And all these moving parts flow into the bull case for Alibaba stock.Taking Ant's Strategy to IndiaAlibaba and Ant (formerly Alipay) invested inOne97Communications, the parent company of Indian e-commerce player Paytm. They are expected to increase their stake to 50% from 42%. Paytm last year spun off its payments business to comply with regulations. One97 holds a 49% stake in Paytm Payments Bank and Paytm founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma owns 51%.Paytm boasted177 million usersat the end of the year and CFO Madhur Deora has set a medium-term target of 500 million users . That growth would be a boost for Alibaba stock and Ant Financial which seeks2 billion users worldwideover the next decade.7 Best Stocks to Buy for a Donald Trump Green LightPaytm is clearly taking a page out of Alibaba and Ant Financial's playbook. Like BABA'sMyBank-  the bank ""for the little guy"" - Paytm's bank promises to be a vehicle for financial inclusion, bringing services to India's unbanked.Like Ant, Paytm also wants to offer loans andasset management servicesto those who can't access them now.Ant Fortune, a wealth management app, debuted in 2015. Its users can put money in Yuebao, a money market fund, and invest inZhao Cai Bao, where they can loan money directly to businesses.Paytm's Threat to BanksBanks in both countries are threatened by this disruption. Ant's Yuebao offers depositors higher interest rates than banks andinstant withdrawals. Technology companies don't have to maintain as many employees at branches as banks do, and can link borrowers and savers directly. Their asset-light model is simply more efficient than that of existing banks, which have to use their own capital, and are burdened by legacy systems and regulation.Banks earn a profit on the spread, the difference between the rate at which they lend and the rates they offer depositors. Platforms that connect borrowers and lenders and cut out the middleman can exert pressure on this. And because Paytm and Ant Financial are branchless, they have lower overhead costs, and can offer lower fees than banks.Paytm will be both a friend and a potential enemy to banks. It will help them drum up business by cross-selling their services to its users. But Paytm will probably be the front-end in customer interactions and relegate the banks to the back end .Banks risk becoming ""dumb pipes."" As I mentioned inmy articlelast year, the front-end generally gives banks a higher return on equity than the back. AMcKinsey & Companystudy found that banks earn a 22% return on equity from sales and origination, but only 6% from the extension of credit.Protectionism RisksAll of this doesn't mean that the success of Alibaba, Ant and Paytm is guaranteed. Some risks still stand in the way.First, protectionist sentiment is rising in India asAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) andUberclobber their Indian rivals. Indian startups such as Flipkart, Snapdeal (in which BABA is an investor), and Ola have had their valuations repeatedly marked down over the past year. Now some are asking for protection against supposedly unfair foreign competition. Indian venture capitalist Vani Kola of Kalaari Capital called for such measures, followed bysimilar sentimentfrom the founders of e-commerce player Flipkart and Ola, viewed as India's home-grown Uber) .Since Paytm is an Indian company, why would this be a concern? While Paytm is Indian, its largest shareholders are Chinese, Alibaba and Ant. Would India want such a company controlling something as critical as its payments infrastructure? Experts have raised concerns overPaytm user dataending up in servers outside of India.Pointing to Paytm's Chinese ties, the chief minister of West Bengal, Mamata Banerjee accused the prime minister ofcompromising national security. The Sino-Indian relationship is contentious; the two countries went to war as recently as 1962 over a border dispute.Valeant Pharmaceuticals Intl Inc (VRX) Q4 Earnings: What to ExpectFor Paytm to work, users must see it as secure and reliable. Without trust, Paytm cannot succeed. However, in December the Paytm server was down for an hour, leaving users unable to make payments.Paytm's customer service also is a weak spot, with many rating it as bad. Also, the recent user increase may be temporary. After March 13, Paytm may lose as much as 30% of its offline customers once cash withdrawal limits end.Bottom Line on Alibaba StockEven if Paytm and BABA succeed, however, buying Alibaba stock is notwithout risks.Alibaba is a variable interest entity, which means American shareholders own shares in a Cayman Islands-based entity. Chinese law forbids foreign ownership in Chinese internet companies like Alibaba, so this structure is a way around it.But the Chinese government's position isn't clear, and it could always change its mind, at the expense of BABA stock holders.As of writing, Lucas Hahn did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace3 Stocks to Watch on Monday: Tesla Inc (TSLA), Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) and BlackBerry Ltd (BBRY)Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT) Stock Could Be a 2017 Surprise7 REITs That Should Be CondemnedThe postAlibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA) Will Try to Dominate Indiaappeared first onInvestorPlace."

The company claims that without those stolen stuff, Otto's technology, which forms an important part of Uber's efforts to roll out autonomous vehicles for its ride sharing service, wouldn't have evolved.Stemmed from an Accidental CC-ingA supplier had mistakenly included a Waymo employee on an e-mail chain that was supposed to be delivered to the Uber team. The attached ""OTTO FILES"" comprised a drawing of a self-driving car Light Detection And Ranging (LIDAR) circuit board quite similar to the one Waymo has been developing secretly.Waymo's lawsuit states that ""The sudden resignations from Waymo, Otto's quick public launch with Mr. Lewandowski at the helm, and Uber's near-immediate acquisition of Otto for more than half a billion dollars all caused Waymo grave concern regarding the possible misuse of its intellectual property.""Reigniting the ConflictThe two camps once lived in harmony. Alphabet executive David Drummond joined Uber's board in 2013 when Alphabet's venture capital arm GV, then Google Ventures, invested $258 million in the company and planned to include Uber rides in the Google Maps app.However, things started to go wrong when Uber decided to develop its own mapping and driverless car technology. The company has opened a technology center in Pittsburgh and hired some robotics specialists from Carnegie Mellon University. It also collaborated with automakers such as Volvo and acquired Otto.Google on the other hand launched a pilot project that enables carpooling in San Francisco Bay Area. Available through Google-owned maps app, Waze, the service is presently under beta testing with a handful of Bay Area companies including Adobe and Google itself. Drummond stepped down from Uber's board last year.The lawsuit certainly complicates the ongoing clash between two of the early leaders in the autonomous vehicle space. Well established car companies like Ford (NYSE:F-Free Report), Toyota (NYSE:TM-Free Report) and General Motors (NYSE:GM-Free Report) on the other hand have just started to make their way into this market.Currently, Alphabet shares carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Under Armour Inc (UA) Stock Offers the Easiest Profits Ever;2/27/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsLost in the collapse ofUnder Armour Inc(NYSE:UA) stock over the past year is an odd divergence between two classes of stock. Shares of UAA stock (Class A) have traded at a substantial premium to UA stock (Class C). The difference is about 10% at the moment, in fact.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockThat gap makes little sense. Class C UA stock has no voting rights. Class A UAA stock does have voting rights of one vote per share. But those rights don't have much value. CEO and founder Kevin Plank owns all of the non-trading Class B shares, which have 10 votes each, giving Plank 65% of the voting power as of December 2016.UAA shareholders are paying a premium for votes which are largely symbolic. And it's not as if other considerations justify that gap. The market is figuring out the divergence, as the 10% premium has narrowed of late. But there's still time for easy profits in shorting UAA and going long UA.As for investors bullish on Under Armour, there's basically no reason to pay up for the UAA stock.No, UAA Stock Isn't Worth More Than UA StockAs seen in the chart below, the gap between UA and UAA has narrowed of late, after peaking in November.7 Best Stocks to Buy for a Donald Trump Green LightAt one point in late November - less than a year after the Class C UA stock was issued - the gap was over 20%, a huge number. In dollars, the difference has dropped to near $2 per share from as high as $7 - but some of that compression has come from the fact that Under Armour stock has declined precipitously after two disappointing earnings reports.With the largely symbolic voting rights not likely to change anytime soon, there's simply very little reason for UA to trade above UAA.According to theregistration statementfiled by Under Armour with the SEC, Class C holders of Under Armour stock are entitled to the same dividends. The only way for Class A shareholders to gain some sort of majority voting power would be for Plank to be terminated for cause or to give up his shares.Neither outcome seems particularly likely given that the CEO is 42 years old, intensely competitive, and intent on turning around his beloved Under Armour himself.Liquidity doesn't justify the different prices for Under Armour stock, either, with one possible exception.There was a notable divergence in equity volume a few months ago. UA stock had an average volume under 1 million shares per day in October, roughly 20% of UAA stock. But volume over the past month is almost equal: 6.5 million shares a day for UA and 6.9 million for UAA. The increase in UA volume probably has something to do with the narrowing premium and implies that the spread will continue to tighten.How To Play Under Armour StockThere is one notable difference between UA and UAA: options volume. For instance, open interest in the UA Jan 2018 $20 puts is just over 400. In contrast, there are more than 11,000 UAA Jan 2018 $20 calls open at the moment.That difference is not enough to justify a 10% premium, however, particularly for smaller investors. And it seems the market is figuring that out. But the gap remains wide enough that there's still room to make what should be close to risk-free profits by going long UA and short UAA.Nvidia Corporation (NVDA): Amazing Company, Not-So-Good Stock ... For NowAny major event - like an acquisition, as unlikely as that seems at the moment - will treat shareholders equally. Any dividend payments will be the same. The only difference between UA and UAA is the opportunity to vote even though those votes have no practical impact.So an arbitrage trade still looks like it has some upside. Voting rights between classes at other stocks usually are below 5%, meaning a long UA/short UAA trade could make another $1 per share with very low risk.For investors who still think Under Armour stock is a better opportunity, then Class C UA stock is the right choice. The premium for UAA stock simply doesn't make a lot of sense - and it's still wide enough to profit from.The author is long UA and short UAA.More From InvestorPlace3 Stocks to Watch on Monday: Tesla Inc (TSLA), Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) and BlackBerry Ltd (BBRY)Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT) Stock Could Be a 2017 SurpriseThe 10 Best Stocks to Buy for 2017: The Experts' PicksThe postUnder Armour Inc (UA) Stock Offers the Easiest Profits Everappeared first onInvestorPlace."

3 Stocks to Watch on Monday: Tesla Inc (TSLA), Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) and BlackBerry Ltd (BBRY);2/27/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe U.S. stock market enters Monday's trading with major indices at all-time highs, and naturally, many individual stocks in the same position. However, experts are increasingly warning about overvalued issues and market bubbles - a theme that likely won't fade this week.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');A number of tech stocks have stolen the spotlight heading into Monday's trade.Alphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL) andBlackBerry Ltd(NASDAQ:BBRY) made waves over the weekend, whileTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) was getting batted around after a Monday morning headline.Here's what you need to know going into today's trade:Tesla Inc (TSLA)TSLA stock is down Monday after the company's shares were knocked down a peg by the analyst community.Goldman Sachs downgraded Tesla shares on Monday morning, dragging the company down from ""Neutral"" to ""Sell.""7 Best Stocks to Buy for a Donald Trump Green LightAnalyst David Tamberrino says:""While we believe Tesla currently has a lead relative to OEM peers with respect to vehicle technology adoption, electric vehicle architecture, and (potentially) battery scale, our concerns are more near-term oriented with respect to operational execution on the Model 3 launch, an unproven solar business, and cash needs. Ultimately we see a delayed launch (pushing volume growth out and to the right) and FCF burn rate (necessitating a capital raise before 4Q17) to weigh on TSLA's shares.""Tamberrino also worries that the SolarCity acquisition ""increased the risk profile of Tesla amidst a business model transition,"" and lowered the price target slightly from $190 to $185.Tesla is coming off a fourth-quarter earnings report during which it was announced that CFO Jason Wheeler would be exiting in April - a surprising move that has drawn a little scrutiny from the investment community.TSLA shares are off more than 2% this morning.Alphabet Inc (GOOGL)Alphabet announced that one of its artificial intelligence productswill be availablein more of the company's products moving forward.Google Assistant will now be available in the company's tablets, smartphones, computers and smartwatches for anyone using Android 6.0 Marshmallow or higher.

Priceline (PCLN) Earnings Coming Up: What to Expect;2/27/2017;"Priceline (PCLN) will report fourth quarter fiscal 2016 financial results today after the closing bell. Investors expect the online travel booking company, which has beaten Wall Street’s earnings estimates in twelve straight quarters, to deliver another solid quarter.Despite increased competition from the likes of Expedia (EXPE) and Alphabet’s (GOOGL), Priceline continues to find ways to grow not only its bookings, but also hotel room units sold. Notably, these metrics have remained steady despite currency pressures that impacts its revenues in overseas markets. On Monday analysts will want to see the extent to which Priceline’s strong international operations can drive growth, particularly with the emergence of new competitors such as Trivago (TRVG).In the three months that ended December, Wall Street expects the Norwalk, Conn.-based company to earn $12.98 per share on revenue of $2.32 billion. This compares to the year-ago quarter when the company earned $12.63 per share on $2.47 billion in revenue. For the full year, earnings are projected to rise 11% year over year to $64.67 per share, while revenue of $10.72 billion would rise 16.2% year over year.makeArticleAd();Priceline’s total gross bookings are expected to be up anywhere from 16% to 21% or in a range of $13.9 billion to $14.5 billion. Analysts sees gross profits to rise about 18% to $2.2 billion. With better-than-expected guidance coming in last week from Trivago, which forecasts 2017 revenue to grow 45%, Priceline is certainly not alone anymore. But the “Name your own price” travel deals giant is still regarded as best-in-class in its category.On Friday Rob Sanderson, analysts at MKM Partners, said he expects Priceline meet or beat the high end of its guidance. But Sanderson, who has a Buy rating on the stock and $1,950 price target, doesn’t expect Priceline to issue strong guidance. Sanderson noted Friday that Priceline’s guidance would be impacted by the Easter holiday that shifts between the first and second quarter. Meanwhile, because of increased competition, Priceline’s costs could rise too.In the third quarter, Priceline’s ""spend to bookings"" ratio grew to 6.03% from 5.77%, partly because it has to spend more money on marketing to bring customers to its platform. Nevertheless, PCLN stock has been on a tear, soaring 30% over the past year, including gains of 11% year to date, besting the S&P 500 index in both spans. And to the extent it can surprise analysts with better guidance, PCLN stock should travel toward’s Sanderson’s $1,950 price target, delivering additional premiums of 20% from current levels."

Nvidia Corporation (NVDA): Amazing Company, Not-So-Good Stock … For Now;2/27/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsStartups may be a source of tremendous innovation. But of course, old-line companies can too. Just look atNvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA). Launched in 1993, the company's co-founders - which included tech veterans like Jen-Hsun Huang (now the CEO), Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem - saw a great opportunity to develop graphics processing units (GPUs) for the gaming market.makeArticleAd();Source:via NvidiaWhile growth was strong, there was always skepticism. Was the market big enough?Well, of course, we know that GPUs have proven to be quite versatile, having applications in diverse areas like AI (artificial intelligence), self-driving cars, VR (virtual reality) and the Internet of Things (IoT). The main reason is that this core technology can process huge amounts of data on a cost-effective basis.And yes, Wall Street has certainly caught on to this. During the past year, NVDA stock is up a sizzling 200%-plus.But what now? Is it still a good time to buy NVDA stock? Or should investors wait for a better valuation?Breaking Down NVDA StockFirst of all, there are signs that the momentum is losing some of its steam. For the year so far, the stock is down 5% after back-to-back downgrades in the past week. This is despite the fact that the overall markets have been extremely bullish, with theNasdaqup about 8.5%.7 Best Stocks to Buy for a Donald Trump Green LightIn fact, since reaching an all-time high in early February, Nvidia stock has since fallen by 14%.Perhaps the most interesting thing has been the muted response from wall Street from the company's mostrecent earnings report. Revenues soared 55% to $2.17 billion and adjusted earnings came to $1.13 per share, up from 94 cents for the same period a year ago. Wall Street, on the other hand, was looking for $2.11 billion in revenues and earnings of 83 cents.For the most part, there was really nothing to complain about. It was, well, nearly a perfect performance.Yet NVDA stock fell by about 2.4% on the news.Then again, it seems that the good news is already baked into the valuation - and then some. Consider that the forward price-to-earnings ratio on NVDA stock is at 30X. By comparison,Facebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) trades at 20X andAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) sports a multiple of 22X. No doubt, the NVDA stock valuation makes other traditional chip operators look almost embarrassing. Keep in mind thatIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) andQualcomm, Inc.(NASDAQ:QCOM) both trade at about 12X.Interestingly enough, Wall Street analysts are getting a little antsy about the valuation for NVDA stock as well. Note that the average price target is at $113.59. This implies only a 7% gain from current levels.For example, Roth Capital Partners analyst Brian Algerdowngradedhis rating on NVDA stock from ""buy"" to ""neutral"" recently. Yes, his biggest concern is the valuation.Besides, the year-over-year comparisons on revenues and earnings will not get any easier for the company. If there is even a slight miss or sign of deceleration, it seems reasonable that there could be a sell-off. Might as well take profits after NVDA stock has provided substantial gains, right?Certainly.Another potential issue is the competition. Let's face it, rivalAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMD) has been making nice strides with its own graphics systems. As seen with the latest earnings report, the company looks poised for a growth spurt - and this may come at the expense of NVDA. Of course, investors have been buying up AMD stock, which is up around 600% during the past year.The Bull Case for Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FMCC) Stock Is Still AliveNow, this is in no way to diminish NVDIA's outstanding technology and the potential growth opportunities. Hey, just with autos, the addressable market could be at least $10 trillion (this is based on recent NVDAinvestor presentation).But for now, there probably should be caution. For the most part, NVDA stock is probably due for a cooling-off period. Yet this should be good news, since it may mean that investors who missed the first big move could get a second chance on the stock.Tom Taulli runs the InvestorPlace blogIPO Playbookand also has his own free iOS app to estimate your tax refund, which is atPathwayTax.com.Follow him on Twitter at@ttaulli.

Incredible! Here's How Many Internet Gadgets the Average Home Has;2/26/2017;"The notion that the world around us, particularly in   tech-friendly North America, is becoming more connected by the   day isn't necessarily surprising. What may raise an eyebrow or   two is just how prevalent connected internet gadgets already   are.What makes the sheer volume of the average homeowner's online   devices jaw-dropping is that by most accounts the Internet of   Things (IoT) in general, and ""smart"" homes in particular, haven't   even gone mainstream yet as most pundits expected last year. But   that's about to change, and today's average North American   consumer's penchant for online devices could prove to be just the   tip of the iceberg.You're kidding, right?It's not surprising the use of smartphones to access the   internet by North American's is skyrocketing. Five years ago   ""home roaming,"" in other words using a smartphone to get   connected, accounted for a mere 9% of fixed access traffic via a   Wi-Fi network. According to a recent study of North American   consumers, that figure has jumped to nearly 30%.makeArticleAd();But mobile phones are just a small piece of the connected   smart home. Gaming consoles are another fast-growing means of   accessing the internet. Surprisingly, few consumers actually use   consoles like theSony(NYSE: SNE) PlayStation to play games: a mere 2.5% according to   the study. However, a full 65% use their PlayStation to stream   movies and other entertainment from over-the-top (OTT) providers   includingNetflix.Laptops and PCs, while still prevalent in North American   households, now account for less than 25% of total internet   traffic. Toss in smart personal home assistants such asAmazon's(NASDAQ: AMZN) Alexa and similar solutions and the average home   in North American has over seven ""active devices in use each   day."" A mind-boggling 6% of homes use more than 15 connected   devices on a daily basis.If those figures seem a bit much, the stunning thing is   connected homes are expected to grow almost exponentially this   year, and continue to climb for years to come.Alphabet Nest unit. Image source: Nest.Ready, set, go!Last year there were an estimated 80 million smart home   devices delivered to consumers across the globe, up a whopping   64% compared to 2015. The stunning part of last year's explosive   smart home growth is it was woefully short of expectations.The problems are largely centered on providers like Amazon andAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) with its Next thermostat hub not   doing an adequate job of explaining the value proposition of   ""intelligent"" homes. As some analysts described it, this will be   the year of the smart home because providers ""will be smarter   about educating their consumers.""Consolidation of smart device manufacturers, Alphabet's $3.2   billion deal for Nest three years ago is one notable example, is   also expected to help in educating consumers as well as bring   costs down. Another factor key to even more widespread existence   of smart homes and devices is security.No more secretsA recent move byIntel(NASDAQ: INTC) to further its IoT initiatives -- a key effort on   CEO Brian Krzanich's transformation agenda -- included partnering   with tech giants includingGEandAT&Tinstalling cameras, microphones, and sensors on 3,200   street lights in San Diego, CA. The objective is to identify   activities including gunshots, monitor crowd sizes, and track   vehicle speeds.Though no San Diego citizen reportedly complained about   privacy issues, others certainly have. Which begs the question:   if the general public is concerned about smart cities invading   our privacy, imagine the unease as our homes become ""smarter"" by   the year? Maybe privacy isn't the issue some have suggested: it   certainly hasn't prevented the average North American consumer   from staying connected at home, by any and all means   possible.10 stocks we like better than Wal-MartWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a       stock tip, it can pay to listen.

3 Horrendously Bad Stock Market Predictions From Otherwise Smart People;2/26/2017;"""It's tough to make predictions, especially about the   future.""-- Yogi BerraEvery year, the stock market either advances, declines, or   stays flat. It's never clear beforehand which direction these   indexes, or the stocks that comprise them, will move; the reasons   for their price swings only make sense in retrospect.makeArticleAd();But that truth doesn't stop people from making aggressive   predictions attempting to identify the Next Big Thing or to call   a coming crash or boom. Here are a few classic examples of some   smart market watchers getting burned by their stock calls.1. McDonald's will trounce Google as an investmentWhitney   Tilsonhas used his value investing approach to produce awesome returns   for himself and his investors over the years. Yet his tendency to   bash ""expensive"" companies with high price-to-earnings ratios has   also burned the hedge fund giant -- big time.For example, back in 2004, Tilson made abold prediction. Writing for The Motley Fool at the time, he said the   soon-to-be-publicAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) (a.k.a. Google) would almost   certainly flame out as a business. ""I'd wager that odds are at   least 90% that its profit margins and growth rate will be   materially lower five years from now,"" he argued.Tilson got even more specific, saying thatMcDonald's(NYSE: MCD) would make a much better bet given its far lower   valuation. ""I believe that it is virtually certain that Google's   stock will be highly disappointing to investors foolish enough to   participate in its overhyped offering -- you can hold me to   that,"" he concluded.GOOGL Market Capdata byYCharts.So how did that prediction pan out? Since 2005, Alphabet   shares are up roughly 16 times, compared to less than a 400%   return for the fast food titan. The search engine giant produced   nearly $20 billion of net income last year, versus McDonald's   $4.5 billion. Today, Alphabet is worth almost six times   McDonald's in the eyes of the market.2. Smartphones will be a bustA deep understanding of technology isn't enough to protect you   from being surprised by major shifts in the industry. Andrew   Grove was one of the founders ofIntel, which profoundly shaped the semiconductor industry. He wasTime Magazine's Man of The Year in 1997. Yet in 1992 he made a prediction that   looks amazingly shortsighted in retrospect.Image source: Getty Images.ANew York Timesarticledescribed Grove as standing diametrically opposed to the position   taken byApple(NASDAQ: AAPL)  that smartphones, then imagined as ""personal   communicators,"" might develop into a huge business. They'd be   ""the mother of all markets,"" according to Apple's then-CEO, John   Sculley.Grove disagreed. The idea of a communicating device that   people carried around with them is ""a pipe dream driven by   greed,"" he said. Ironically, the article lists a few predictions   about the technology that proved prescient. These personal   communicators might handle emails, use GPS to map directions, and   even allow someone to ""order pizza using a combination of custom   electronic forms and wireless fax.""Today, the smartphone industry is massive, with Apple   accounting for nearly 150 million iPhone sales in the past year.   These devices helped spur over $24 billion of complementary   service-based revenue, which demonstrates that, if anything,   investors weren't being greedy enough about the potential for   smartphones to find a huge market.3. The Dow is headed to 36,000James Glassman's 1999 book titledDow 36,000hasn't aged well. In fact, Washington Post economics columnist   Neil Irwincalled it""perhaps the most spectacularly wrong investing book ever"" given   that it forecast a massive rally for stocks between 1999 and   2004.Glassman's timing couldn't have been worse. The Dow hit 14,000   the year his book published before plummeting to a 15-year low of   7,000 in 2009. A roaring rally has pushed the blue-chip index   back to new highs recently, but today it's still 42% below the   mark he believed the Dow would achieve over a decade ago.^DJIdata byYCharts.To his credit, Glassman has taken a hard look at how his   prediction could have been so far off the mark. He identified two   major factors thathe and his co-author missed: earnings growth and the attitude of investors as reflected in   the price-to-earnings multiples they are willing to pay for   stocks. Neither trend went in the direction they had   targeted.A better wayThese failed forecasts illustrate how overconfidence can prove   fatal to your portfolio while predictions about economic trends   are rarely more than a distraction from the business of   accumulating stock market returns.Bold predictions are compelling because they attract debate   and can pay big dividends if proven correct. But no one knows   which direction stocks or markets will move over the short term.   That's why investors are better off simply buying a diverse group   of solid stocks and holding on to the shares for years (or   decades) while allowing the power of compound returns to do all   of the hard work.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

GoPro Hasn't Bought Back Any Shares in 2017. Should Investors Be Happy?;2/25/2017;"In late 2015,GoPro(NASDAQ: GPRO) approved a $300 million buyback plan that lasted   for 12 months. However, the action camera maker only spent $35.6   million on buybacks before the plan expired last September.Those purchases were poorly timed, since GoPro bought back    about 1.5 million shares at an average price of $23.05 per   share -- roughly 140% higher than its price today. GoPro made    all those purchases during the fourth quarter of 2015, and   didn't buy back any more stock until the plan expired.Image source: GoPro.makeArticleAd();By doing so, GoPro has seemingly acknowledged that initiating   a buyback plan was a really bad move, and the company doesn't   seem interested in buying back any more stock for the foreseeable   future. Should investors be happy or upset about this strategic   shift?Why investors should be happyGoPro's prior buyback plan burned cash that should have been   applied to R&D or acquisitions of smaller companies, since   the company is gradually falling behind the tech curve.The Hero 5 isn't much more powerful than the Hero 4, the Karma   drone's recall practically handed the market toDJI, and GoPro still hasn't launched a stand-alone 360-degree camera   to counterSamsung's(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) Gear 360,Ricoh's Theta, and other similar cameras. GoPro's software ecosystem   also remains small, despite the introduction of new editing apps   and acloud backup service. Investing heavily in those areas would make more sense than   buying back stock.Samsung's Gear 360. Image source: Samsung.Even if GoPro wanted to repurchase stock, it can no longer do   so from its free cash flow. The company generated a negative free   cash flow of $151 million over the past 12 months, due to four   straight quarters of losses that only recently ended with areturn to profitabilitylast quarter.The lack of a new buyback plan also  indicates that CFO   Brian McGee, who replaced Jack Lazar last March, doesn't plan to   follow in his predecessor's footsteps. When Lazar unveiled the   previous buyback in 2015, some analysts saw the plan as a thinly   veiled attempt to offset GoPro's liberal use of stock-based   compensation -- which inflated its share count and diluted   existing shares. That move arguably benefited insiders much more   than investors.Why investors should be upsetHowever, launching a new buyback plan this year would give   investors a sign that the stock's downside potential is limited.   GoPro stock also isn't expensive, with an EV/Sales ratio of 0.96   and a 5-year PEG ratio of 0.7. Since a PEG ratio under 1 is   considered cheap, GoPro is undervalued relative to its earnings   growth potential --ifit can match analysts' long-term expectations.Many of GoPro's investors would likely welcome a buyback,   since the stock's only near-term catalyst is the relaunch of the   Karma, which could struggle to reach customers after missing the   crucial holiday season.A big buyback could also flush out short sellers -- who were   shorting 33% of the company's outstanding shares as of Feb. 9 --   and spark a short squeeze. That rally could inspire GoPro's   insiders, who sold more shares than they bought over the past 12   months, to  finally buy more shares. That, in turn, could   inspire institutional investors, who only hold about 38% of GoPro   shares, to finally come back.Forget about buybacks... for nowGoPro's abandonment of buybacks can be considered positive or   negative, but I believe that the company should focus more on   improving its core technologies.The company has repeatedly claimed that it has a bright future   in virtual reality, but its multi-camera Omni and Odyssey rigs   were too bulky and pricey compared to cheaper action-camera sized   solutions like the Gear 360. GoPro secured an early 360-degree   video partnership withAlphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) YouTube, but YouTube   subsequentlyopened up that platformto a wide range of other cheaper cameras.GoPro's cloud backup platform also doesn't make sense, since   it charges a $5 monthly fee for a service which Google Photos   provides for free on smartphones. Moreover, the platform doesn't   backup videos in 4K quality -- which likely disappoints hardcore   GoPro users. Lastly, GoPro must execute a smart marketing blitz   to get the Karma back on track, especially after DJI's Mavic Pro   delivered many similar features in a superior package last   year.The key takeawayBuybacks are often considered a strategy that mature companies   use after they run out of ways to significantly improve their   core businesses. GoPro is in a slump, but it hasn't reached   maturity yet since it still has plenty of ways to improve its   camera, drone, and software businesses. Therefore, I believe that   investors should be happy that GoPro didn't initiate a new   buyback plan this year.10 stocks we like better than GoProWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Tiny Company That Bought Google's Satellites Becomes a Rising Star;2/25/2017;"There's a battle going on in outer space, for control of the   Earth imaging market.Yesterday morning, we learned thatDigitalGlobe(NYSE: DGI) hassold itselfto Canadian space-tech specialistMacDonald, Dettwiler and Associatesfor a purchase price of $2.4 billion -- and not a moment too   soon. DigitalGlobe, if you recall, is the American   satellite-imaging company that itselfbought one-time Motley Fool recommendation   GeoEyea few years ago.Just before announcingits ownsale, DigitalGlobe reported a loss for its fiscal fourth quarter.   And if you ask me, this suggests the time is ripe for   DigitalGlobe to cash out -- the more so because its primary area   of business is about to get even tougher to compete in.makeArticleAd();How hi-res is a high-resolution snapshot from space? Here's     one that Planet Labs' now-acquired Terra Bella satellites     recently snapped of the U.S. Air Force's Davis-Monthan airplane     ""boneyard"" of decommissioned military aircraft. Image source:     Terra Bella.Who is DigitalGlobe?DigitalGlobe is one of the biggest names in satellite-based,   highly detailed Earth imaging. The company operates a   constellation of five satellites capable of snapping photographs   from orbit at resolutions as minute as 30 centimeters per pixel.   DigitalGlobe calls its constellation ""the best in the world"" and   ""the largest constellation in the industry,"" and that's at least   half right.Problem is, it's also half wrong. DigitalGlobe may dominate   the market for highly detailed Earth imaging. But over at upstart   Planet Labs (also known simply as ""Planet""), one of the leaders   of the ""new space"" industry is rapidly overtaking DigitalGlobe in   breadth of coverage.(Re-)Introducing Planet LabsAs we discussed last month, Planet had for some time been   discussing acquiringAlphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL)satellite imaging business, Terra Bella. The purchase price remains a mystery -- but the deal itself is   apparently now a ""go."" On Feb. 3, Planet confirmed that it will   indeed acquire Terra Bella from Alphabet, along with its fleet of   seven high-resolution (capable of sub-meter resolutions)   satellites.Then, last week, Planet announced the launch of 88 new ""Dove""   medium-resolution (three to five meters per pixel) satellites,   more than doubling the size of its medium-res constellation to   144 birds in orbit.Planet made history here in a couple of ways. First, its   deployment was part of an Indian government PSLV (Polar Satellite   Launch Vehicle) launch that sent 16 other satellites, in addition   to Planet's, into space. At 104 satellites total, the mission   that carried Planet's Doves was the largest-ever satellite   deployment made from a single rocket.More important, Planet says that its 144 Doves in orbit, plus   five RapidEye satellites acquired from BlackBridge in 2015, give   it a constellation of 149 satellites in orbit today. Feel free to   mentally add seven more to that number once the Terra Bella   acquisition is finalized, if you like. But already, Planet's   mixed bag of 149 satellites gives it ""the largest private   satellite constellation in history.""This is significant not only because it gives Planet bragging   rights. By more than doubling its satellite constellation, Planet   says it now has the ability to ""image all of Earth's landmass   every day."" Alone among satellite operators, Planet can now take   a snapshot of every square foot of Earth's solid surface once per   day, every day of the year.What it means to investorsWith every passing day, Planet Labs is getting bigger,   treading more and more on DigitalGlobe's astro-turf, and making   its rival's products nonunique. Indeed, even if the photos taken   by Planet's Doves don't offer quite the same resolution as   DigitalGlobe offers, Planet's ability to take somanysnapshots every day gives the company a more all-encompassing   view of what's happening around the globe.It's difficult to guess what advances will flow from access to   such data. Better weather forecasting, certainly. A clearer view   of the progression of global warming, its effects and its causes,   very likely. But we can also anticipate Planet generating better   data on traffic patterns on highways, at ports, and along   shipping routes; on the spread of residential development that   could guide brick-and-mortar retailers on where to place their   next big-box stores; and in countless other ways.The future is looking awfully bright for Planet Labs. And it's   getting brighter every day, one Dove at a time.Look! Up in the sky! This time it really is a bird -- in     fact, a whole lot of Planet Labs' Flock 3p Doves.

Image source: IMAX.IMAX Corporation(NYSE: IMAX)  is the acknowledged industry leader in the   premium large theater format and has built its reputation on the   continuous innovation of its digital movie camera and   high-performance laser projection system. With that expertise, it   should come as no surprise that, whenAlphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) Google decided to enter the   field of virtual reality, it partnered with IMAX to develop the   best ""cinema-grade virtual reality (VR) camera."" IMAX is   providing a crew of engineers and technicians that will   collaborate with Google to develop a high-resolution camera from   scratch to address the unique challenges presented by virtual   reality. It will leverage Google's Jump platform, which stitches   together 360 degree video into a seamless panoramic view,   providing an immersive experience.makeArticleAd();IMAX then announced a virtual reality location-based   initiative, in a joint venture with the game developer Starbreeze   AB. This agreement would integrate the company's StarVR headset,   which provides an industry-leading 210-degree view, and its   library of virtual reality games and entertainment with content   produced on the IMAX Google VR camera.

Tech Most Popular Sector for Investment Fund Managers in 2017;2/24/2017;"Data show that Silicon Valley darlings once again captured the interest of stock fund managers looking to cash in on the sector's growth and dreams in the fourth quarter of 2016.In a ranking of the 20 S&P 500 stocks that U.S. funds managing more than $1 million bought the most, tech companies took eight spots: Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL), Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Cisco (CSCO), Alphabet (GOOG) and Intel (INTC). Microsoft and Apple also saw the most buying in the S&P 500, according to data compiled by GuruFocus.The results show U.S. investment fund managers packing into a market sector that already sprinted through last year, gaining 23.5% in 2016 versus 9.54% in the S&P 500. So far, it has not broken a sweat going into 2017, rising 29.49% year to date versus 5.58% in the S&P 500. Only one sector has outperformed it, financials, which rose 44.90% year to date on the back of investor optimism in future tax cuts and interest rate hikes.makeArticleAd();Some research indicates investors can expect further growth for tech. Global information company The NPD Group forecasts 2% growth in technology industry sales in 2017 from 2016, driven by innovation, new products and low prices. A gaggle of fresh product categories is also slated to lure more buyers, like drones, virtual reality and home automation products, in addition to seasoned products like TVs and PCs in the premium space.For just one product, drones, NPD researchers anticipate 177% in sales growth from 2016 to 2018, led mainly by hobbyists. Less tech-savvy consumers may also begin to get on board with smart home devices, where NPD predicts 80% growth over the same period.Other megatrends continue down the pipeline, like cloud computing, big dada and artificial intelligence, but some market watchers see reason for worry.""Looking at the other side of these favorable long-term trends, I remain wary of certain hardware companies whose products are becoming commoditized. For example, in the personal computer market, virtual reality headsets and computers are an opportunity for growth, but so far, demand has been largely anemic,"" said one analyst, Charlie Chai of Fidelity in a sector outlook.""""The smart-device market is increasingly saturated and lacks products capable of driving sustainable new excitement. On the enterprise hardware front, there continue to be many technology disruptions, which increase the long-term risks for some incumbents. Although valuations are generally low for enterprise hardware companies, I continue to struggle with their challenging long-term outlooks.""Employment momentum has carried over into 2017, indicating companies see these opportunities expanding. The tech industry added a net 9,000 jobs in the IT sector in January, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The highest employment growth occurred in software and technology services where 12,500 jobs were added, extending growth of 73,900 jobs in 2016, despite layoffs at numerous companies.Earnings growth has supported tech's rally. Of the 408 companies that had reported earnings as of Feb. 17, tech led all sectors with a 12.1% increase year over year, amounting to an additional $68.2 billion. Eight of the 11 sectors were expected to finish the quarter with improved earnings, according to Thomson Reuters. Yet when removing sub-industries with the highest growth, semiconductor equipment and electronic manufacturing services, the growth rate declines to 11.1%, more in line with financials and utilities.The S&P North American tech sector index had a trailing price-earnings ratio of 28.07 and projected price-earnings ratio of 20.47 as of Jan. 31. It also had a price-book ratio of 4.92%, price-free cash flow ratio of 16.52 and dividend yield of 1.21%.

Personal computing fell 5% primarily by a drop in gaming revenue and its feature phone business, which it sold in November. During the quarter, the company returned $6.5 billion to shareholders in share repurchases and dividends.Donald Yacktman(Trades,Portfolio)'sYacktman Fund(Trades, Portfolio)s commented on the company in its recent letter, ""Microsoft's shares were solid contributors to fourth-quarter results as the company continues its remarkable transformation under CEO Satya Nadella.

IMAX's Mediocre Results Belie Blockbuster Opportunities;2/24/2017;"For those invested inIMAX Corporation(NYSE: IMAX) , the industry leader in large screen movie   theaters, it should come as no surprise that the company's   performance follows the slate of movies for the year -- the   company lives and dies by blockbusters.In 2016, box office growth was tepid, so the company had some   tough comps going into its fourth-quarter and full year financial   report, and investors were preparing for the worst.Will IMAX's outlook improve in 2017? Image source: IMAX.makeArticleAd();Tough compsIMAX reported revenue of $106.9 million for the quarter, down   10% from $119.3 million from the prior year quarter, though it   was better than the $99.6 million analysts were expecting. Net   income of $0.27 per diluted share also exceeded expectations of   $0.21 expected by analysts. Pulling back to a wider view, the   overall annual results looked better. For the full year, IMAX   produced revenue of $377 million compared to $374 million in the   prior year.Let's face it: While 2016 was a good year at the movies, this   was never going to be easy. The slate from 2015 boasted such   cinematic heavyweights asJurassic World,Furious 7,Avengers: Age of Ultron,Minions, andStar Wars: The Force Awakens. These top five movies pulled in a combined $7.8 billion in box   office. Even though 2016 leadersCaptain America: Civil War,Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,Finding DoryandZootopia, andThe Jungle Bookwere each an unqualified success, their combined box office of   $5.2 billion was nearly $2.6 billion below the results of 2015's   all-stars. That's a lot of popcorn.Expanding network and dealsThere was, however, plenty of good news in the report for   investors willing to dig a little deeper. The company installed   166 new IMAX theaters during the year, up 22% over the prior   year. This brings the installed base of theaters to 1,215 screens   in 75 countries. The company also signed installation agreements   for a record 319 IMAX theater systems during the year and the   backlog of theaters waiting to be built now totals 498. The   majority of these new signings were joint-revenue sharing   agreements, which cost more up front, but allows IMAX to share in   future box office revenue going forward. This all indicates that   the company is well positioned to take advantage of an improved   slate of movies in 2017 and beyond.IMAX also announced that it had extended its existing   agreement withThe Walt Disney Company(NYSE: DIS) with a multi-picture deal through 2019. From the   press release:Highlights of the agreement include IMAX's involvement in     the release of Lucasfilm's untitledIndiana Jonesfilm, untitled Han SoloStar Warsanthology film,Star Wars: The Last JediandStar Wars: Episode IX,Marvel'sBlack Panther,Ant-Man and the Wasp,Captain Marvel,Avengers: Infinity Warand the untitled Avengers sequel; Disney'sBeauty and the Beast,A Wrinkle in TimeandMulan; Pixar'sThe Incredibles 2andToy Story 4and Walt Disney Animation Studios' Wreck-It Ralph sequel.IMAX has new virtual opportunites! Image source: IMAX.JUMPing on this opportunitiesAnother exciting development for the company is in the field   of virtual reality (VR). IMAX announced last year that it had   partnered withAlphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) Google to develop a cinema grade   VR camera, incorporating Google's Jump 360 camera rig. This fits   into IMAX's strategy for a location-based virtual reality   initiative, which would allow friends to participate in a group   VR experience. On the conference call, IMAX indicated that more   than 7,000 attendees had visited the pilot center, which opened   in Los Angeles on January 6th, during its first six weeks of   operation. The company believes that providing consumers with an   option to participate in VR without spending thousands of dollars   on equipment will ""kick-start"" the industry. As the result of   this successful pilot, IMAX is expanding its experiment to five   additional locations, which it expects will all be open by   mid-year.Though 2016 didn't give IMAX investors anything to cheer   about, the company has been investing in the future. IMAX has   been quietly investing in big initiatives, signing new theaters   and building out its network.

Buy the Kinder Morgan Inc (KMI) Stock Dip and Sit Tight;2/24/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsKinder Morgan Inc(NYSE:KMI) is one of the largest midstream energy players in the U.S. In the energy patch, there are upstream firms (exploration and production), midstream firms (pipelines and storage terminals) and downstream firms (retail, refining and distribution). Big energy companies likeExxon Mobil Corporation(NYSE:XOM) are vertically integrated across all of these sectors.makeArticleAd();Source:Roy Luck via FlickrThe midstream players have been interesting for two core reasons: Many were master limited partnerships (MLPs) that treated shareholders as owners, and distributed profits on a regular basis in the form of dividends. And those dividends were very juicy for a while.The second reason is, midstream players are more like toll booth operators. Unlike their upstream or downstream brethren, the price of whatever commodity is flowing through pipes matters little to midstream players. It's the volume that matters.3 Earnings Reports That Should Be on Your RadarWith all this in mind, we can now explore where KMI fits into the picture right now.KMI Stock TurnaroundIn late 2014, KMI announced it was going to buy up its MLPs and consolidate them into the general partner firm Kinder Morgan. This was a $76 billion internal acquisition and made KMI ""the largest midstream company and third largest energy firm in the U.S."", according to its CEO and Chairman Richard Kinder. It now operates 84,000 miles of pipelines in the US and Canada, with 155 terminals.The goal was likely to consolidate the profits into KMI and not have to distribute so much of the profits to shareholders. That was all well and good, but then the bottom fell out of the energy markets. As the merger was announced, oil was nearly $100 a barrel and natural gas was around $4 per million BTU. Now, oil and natural gas are slightly better than half those prices.Needless to say, the past couple of years have been tough on KMI in particular and the U.S. energy patch in general. But there is a turnaround under way. Rig counts in the U.S. are up, week after week. Mergers are popping in the midstream space and companies that have cash are looking to gain market share.U.S. inventories are growing and exports are booming. Shale production is getting back online. The economy is getting back on its feet. Things are looking up.And even if this increased production keeps prices low, it doesn't matter to KMI. It will be making money on the increased flow, not the prices.

It's Friday, Feb. 17, and we're talking tech   and exploring Snap's IPO filing. I'm your host, Dylan Lewis,   and I'm joined on Skype byfool.comsenior tech specialist Evan Niu. Evan, how's it going?Evan Niu:Pretty good, pretty good.Lewis:Are you a Snapchat user? Do you have it on your phone?Niu:I recently downloaded it just to play around with it. I've   read plenty about it, I know how it works, I know the gist of it.   But I started playing around with it, and it's really not   intuitive or easy to use. [laughs] I don't have a lot of people   on there that I follow, so I certainly don't have the full   experience of regular users. But I don't really see the appeal to   it. It seems really niche to me.Lewis:Yeah, I'll say, I am a Snapchat user. I have a lot of   friends that use it. My interest will wane depending on how often   my friends are using it, and that will bring me in or out of the   system. But, it seems to be super popular with millennials, and   given a lot of the buzz with the company and the fact that it is   a big tech company that's thinking about going public, there   are a lot of investors that are interested in it.Niu:Yeah, there's been so much hype around this thing. It   doesn't seem to me like it has a mainstream appeal, which is the   exact problem thatTwitter(NYSE:TWTR)  has run into over the past few years. I see a lot more   closer comparisons to Twitter thanFacebook(NASDAQ: FB) , which is the exact opposite storyline that Snap is   going to try to sell doing its roadshow.Lewis:Yeah. Listeners, to give you an idea of what we're going to   talk about today, give you a little overview of Snap, the   Snapchat property specifically, talk a bit about their plans to   go public, and what Evan and I noticed when we dug through the   S-1 that recently became available. So, we talked about, they are   social media company, but they call themselves a camera   company, which is interesting.Niu:I noticed this really funny coincidence -- I don't know if   you would call it a coincidence -- Snapchat used to consider   itself a storytelling company, and now it's calling itself a   camera company. Meanwhile,GoProused to call itself a camera company and now is trying to   call itself a storytelling company. So, these two companies, they   have this weird identity thing where they want to be each other,   and I don't get why, because it's not like GoPro is doing very   well. I think it's kind of a weird thing rebrand themselves as a   camera company. I mean, they have the new Spectacle glasses   with cameras, but I don't know. It's just a weird identity to   me.Lewis:Yeah. For listeners who might not be familiar with the   social media platform Snapchat, basically, you can think of it as   a messaging platform where you are, for the most part, shooting   quick, instantly deleted pictures and videos to you and your   friends. You can also post them as stories. It has gained a lot   of popularity with the millennial group. User count is still kind   of low, we can talk about that a little bit, but the company is   planning to go public, looking to raise $3 billion via the public   markets in an issuance that would value the whole company   a somewhere between $20 [billion] to $25 billion. As tech   IPOs go, this might be one of the biggest ones for 2017.Niu:Yeah, definitely. It's definitely the most exciting, the   most looked forward to. People have been waiting for this thing   for years.Lewis:Yeah, and anything that's consumer-facing is naturally   going to have a lot more buzz to it. I think there might be some   folks out there who are saying, ""Wait a minute, I thought I saw   an announcement that this company planned to IPO back in the fall   of 2016. Why are we just getting the S-1 and all the   information about the company in the past couple weeks?""   That's because Snap opted to go public via the confidential IPO   process. This process and this approach is a byproduct of the   2012 Jumpstart Our Businesses Act. Basically, under this updated   legislation, companies with under $1 billion in annual revenue   can file paperwork for an IPO confidentially with the SEC. That   allows the company to go back and forth with the regulatory   agency without alerting the public that they are planning on   IPO-ing, although Snap chose to do so anyway. Then, once the   company decides they do want to go forward with an issuance, the   filing must be made public at least three weeks prior to the IPO   roadshow beginning, which is when the underwriting investment   banks begin talking to clients and building interest in a   potential issuance. This is all to say, while the ""confidential   IPO"" name might sound kind of shady, this is something that's   totally on the up-and-up. And that is the reason why we only got   a look at the company's books and the S-1 earlier this month,   even though they announced intentions to IPO a ways back.Niu:Right. I think part of the purpose is to, like you   mentioned, avoid public scrutiny for the early drafts of the S-1.   All companies always have to file the S-1, but this way they can   refine it without all the public scrutiny, looking at it and   scrutinizing it. I think the idea is to encourage more companies   to explore the IPO process, and if companies do end up going   public, they get more capital, and it just boosts the economy in   terms of more investments happening. I think that's the goal.   But, yeah, it is a little weird when you hear ""confidential.""Lewis:Yeah, and I think it also gives companies the opportunity   to maybe think about going public and walk back without sharing   all of their business information publicly. So, you can test the   waters and see if you're ready, and you might decide you're not,   but you don't have to go through the question of your business   practices, if you think you're going to file and you have to   publicly walk back.Niu:Right, exactly.Lewis:So, that's part of it. There are some adjustments in the   regulatory requirements for how far back a company needs to   provide financial statements, as well. But really, all in all,   it's a tool that allows small-growing companies to keep some of   their core business info private and make the going-public   process a little bit easier. And that's really all there is to   the confidential IPO process. Given that the company's S-1 filing   became public earlier this month, I think it's fairly safe to   assume we're going to see Snap trading on the New York Stock   Exchange sometime in the next couple months. Evan?Niu:Yeah, seems like it's coming.Lewis:Considering that they are a social media company, I think   it makes the most sense to start looking at their user base and   what's going on there. That's kind of the lifeblood of businesses   like Facebook and Twitter, and Snap is really no different.   Within their S-1, they mention, ""We assess the health of our   business by measuring daily active users because we believe that   this metric is the most reliable way to understand engagement on   our platform."" So, it's clear that this is what they're honing it   on as a key metric, and it's what investors are going to be   watching as well.Niu:Yeah. I did find it interesting that they don't disclose   monthly active users, they only disclose daily active users,   which is right around 160 million. With social media companies, I   always tend to look at sequential growth as opposed to   year-over-year growth, because with user base, that's the nature,   there's no seasonality, it's just how much you can grow over   time. So, I look at sequential. In that respect, Snap's growth is   really decelerating -- it's grinding to a halt, almost. And the   company tries to explain this in saying, ""Oh, it's because we   haven't come out with any big new product innovation."" And, of   course, that has an impact, but you also have to worry about   competition, because Facebook has done a really good job copying   a lot of Snapchat's features, especially the Story thing, which   is now on Instagram. Facebook already has, I think, about 150   million daily active users using Stories now. And they launched   that last year, and it's an exact replica. So, you have to wonder   if that's what's taking a bite out of it. And, obviously,   Facebook is much bigger, they have more resources, they can   innovate and develop faster. It's really Mark Zuckerberg, and   Silicon Valley's -- I mean, Snapchat isn't based in Silicon   Valley, but Facebook certainly is -- and Facebook tried to buy   them, and if they can't buy them, they'll copy them, and they   compete, and that's exactly what they're doing. And they're doing   a really good job so far. So, I think there is some concern about   competition and whether or not Snap can really keep up.Lewis:Yeah. And Facebook famously made Snapchat an offer, I   believe it was somewhere around $5 billion or so, a little ways   back, and CEO Evan Spiegel said, ""No, we're going to see what we   can do with this on our own."" If they wind up going public at   this gaudy valuation, it certainly works out well for him, but   you wonder if that might have stoked the competitive fire in Mark   Zuckerberg a little bit.Niu:And he can also empathize, because he did the exact same   thing withGoogle(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) . [laughs] So many people tried to   buy Facebook, and he said, ""No, I want to do my own thing,"" and   now Facebook is enormous and he is one of the richest men in the   world. [laughs]Lewis:Yeah it's hard to blame him for that. To put some numbers   on what's going on with their user growth, like you said,   year-over-year, the numbers look really great. They're up 48%.   But sequentially, Q3 to Q4 of 2016, growth was only 3%. So, if   you look at the graph that they provided in their S-1, it does   look like growth is flattening out a little bit. Given that so   much of the expectation for these social platforms is continuing   to build user base, and being able to monetize that user base   really well, you have to worry about that as an ongoing risk for   the business.Niu:Yeah. If they are a niche product, which, it seems that way   to me, then this could be it...and, obviously, 160 million daily   users is a pretty big number. And you can build a healthy   business there if you keep your expectations modest and try to   build around that base. Whereas, if you're trying to grow, if   you're spending a ton of money trying to grow it, and you can't,   which is exactly the problem that Twitter is having, then that's   when it starts to hurt financially. But if you just accept   it for what it is and plan your business accordingly, you can   build a pretty decent business out of it.Lewis:Yeah. For some context, I went back and looked at   Facebook's S-1 to see how they stacked up when they went   public. At the time, they had 480 million daily active users, and   they were posting 48% year-over-year growth and 6% sequential   growth. You hear that and think, ""Well, those growth rates are   kind of similar, right?"" The difference was scale. Even when they   were doing single-digit sequential growth quarter-to-quarter,   they were still adding tens of millions of users, not five   million, as Snapchat did last quarter. I think that's a huge   risk, especially as you see a more entrenched competitor taking   what's working for you and has a lot of traction with users that   you already have on your platform and just applying it to this   massive user base that they have.Niu:Right. Facebook is interesting because they started   earlier, before the really big rise of mobile. So a lot of their   early days were on desktop. Then, they had to navigate the   transition to mobile, which they have done ridiculously well, far   better than I think anyone ever imagined, whereas companies like   Twitter and Snap, they came out on mobile from the beginning.   Particularly Snap -- I mean, there is no desktop Snapchat.Lewis:Right. Beyond the user base, I think a lot of people want   to know what's going on with the financials as well. In 2016, the   company booked $404 million in revenue, up from $58 million in   revenue in 2015. That is humongous growth, but that is on a very   tiny denominator. The reality with Snapchat is that they really   just kind of turned on the monetization engine there, and have   only really rolled out ads for a very short period of time. Right   now, even, it's still a pretty ad-light experience for users.Niu:Yeah. They only recently released their API to automate ad   sales, which is a hugely important part of scaling for   advertising businesses, because it allows your advertisers to do   this automatically, it's much less labor-intensive to do it. So,   they literally only did this a few months ago, and it's still in   beta. So, it's very early days in terms of their ad business.Lewis:And that's really what's going to be making up most of the   money for Snap overall, right? Advertising made up 96% of   Snap's revenue in 2016. I don't expect that to change. We talked   about how they have the Spectacles as well, and they bill   themselves as a camera company. There might be some hardware   applications somewhere down the road, but in terms of a scalable,   high-margin business, they're going to look to monetize the   Snapchat platform first, because if they can do it well, the   opportunity is the biggest there.Niu:Oh, absolutely. You can't make money on hardware. Those   glasses...you might make a little bit of money, but the whole   point of that is to get people to use the platform.Lewis:Exactly, yeah. And that just feeds into the idea of people   posting their stories and sending stuff to friends, and making   that video and picture capture a little bit easier. Looking down   at their bottom line, they ran a $500 million loss in 2016, down   even more from losses of $370 million in 2015. The company is   also free cash flow negative to the tune of $670 million. No   surprise there. It's a high-growth tech company, very rarely   are they profitable when they go public. But one thing, I don't   want to nitpick too much with costs, but one line item that   popped out to me was general and administrative expenses are $165   million, which is more than they spent in sales and marketing,   and almost as much as the company spent in R&D. And they talk   about how this is attributable to headcount increasing 200% year   over year, but from a corporate strategy perspective, it seems   like there's sinking a ton of money into G&A. I would think,   if anything, the big money suck would be on the tech side, and   gaining talent and pushing the platform in a new direction.Niu:Particularly with them talking about how important product   innovation is to driving user growth, you would think they would   invest more in that. But yeah, overall, I'm not too surprised at   their costs in terms of their operating expenses. I just don't   know what they're going to do next to try to really grow the   platform more. Why aren't they spending more money on   R&D?Lewis:Yeah. And they're going to have to. If you look at the   current valuation...we talked about how they're probably going to   end up IPOing somewhere in the $20 [billion] to $25 billion   valuation range. That would mean that they are trading at 62X   trailing sales. Not earnings, sales. That is a huge number.Niu:Yeah, it's ridiculous. I remember when Twitter and Facebook   went public a few years back. They both went probably right   around 25-26X sales. And back then, I was like, ""Wow, that's   really expensive."" [laughs] And now, 62X sales, it's unheard   of. It just speaks to the hype around this company. Of course,   the valuation is going to change, and we don't know what they're   actually going to price the IPO at. Right now, everything is   really preliminary, and they don't price the IPO until the night   before it actually goes public. And, of course, that's all a   function of how successful the roadshow is. If they can   really drum up investor interest, or conversely, if they don't,   then that's going to really drive what the IPO price is at. But   there's a possibility that this goes higher if they have a really   good roadshow, which is insane. Can you imagine them getting   closer to 70X sales? Who knows at this point -- it's not   impossible for that to happen. It's just insane that this company   would be able to command such a premium.Lewis:And I think another layer of context here: Were it to IPO   and have a valuation somewhere in the mid 20s, it would basically   be valued at twice Twitter's current valuation. According to   analysts, Snapchat has more daily active users than Twitter, but   Twitter brought in 5X as much revenue last year. So, when you   think about what a really successful ad launch would look like,   and building out the platform in a way that has non-invasive ads   that don't really detract too much from user experience, and you   start to get into that $2.5 billion annual ad revenue, and   building on that. And they would be doing that at twice the   valuation that Twitter is currently at. So, you just look at the   numbers, and it's really tough to make it work, the way it's   currently priced.Niu:Yeah. There's no way I'm touching this thing. [laughs]Lewis:Beyond valuation and some of the user growth issues, I know   that you particularly wanted to hone in on some of the stuff with   voting rights with the shares they'll actually be issuing.Niu:Yeah, I think it's really interesting. The shares that   they're issuing to the public get zero votes. Not even one, zero.   A lot of tech companies have been doing this thing for a long   time where they give the public shares one vote, and the insiders   get these supervoting shares with 10 votes or more. That allows   the company founders and insiders to maintain control no matter   what. Google is probably the biggest and earliest example of   this. Even today, collectively, all the insiders, between the   executives and directors of Google, they collectively control   about 60% of the voting power. So, public investors really have   no say. If they disagree with something, they have no   recourse. Facebook is, of course, another good example, with   Zuckerberg himself personally controlling about 60% of the voting   power. So, he wouldn't even have to ask anyone, he just does   whatever he wants. So, the question is, is it really a big deal?   Investors are now used to this idea that they don't get a say and   how these companies are run. The difference with Snap is that   they're basically being upfront and being like, ""You don't even   get to pretend like you have a say.""Certainly, it's all bad from a corporate governance   perspective on principle, because obviously, it's better for   shareholders to have a say. But at the same time, you can see   that it's worked quite well for companies like Google and   Facebook. Imagine if Google shareholders had a vote in telling   Google not to do all this random side stuff that they explore,   you could argue that the company wouldn't be as successful as it   has. There is a case to be made that this is a good thing, in   some situations. But we don't know how it's going to play out for   Snap.Lewis:Yeah. I think one of the reasons why I have a bone to pick   with it is, you have the two company co-founders, Evan Spiegel,   the CEO, and Robert Murphy, the CTO. They are the sole owners of   the supervoting Class C shares, which get 10 votes. Any Class Bs   or Cs that are sold are transferred automatically convert to the   Class As, the non-voting shares. Anything that would happen with   them, they have a supermajority, and anything that might happen   would continue to concentrate that power. So, you look at these   tech companies later on issuing non-voting shares, or with   Facebook, deciding that they want to split its stock and issue C   shares so that Mark Zuckerberg can retain his control of the   company and be able to give away the non-voting shares through   his charitable efforts. Mark Zuckerberg has demonstrated that he   has the right combination of that tech-forward thinking and the   business savvy in order to run one of the world's biggest   companies and do it incredibly successfully. Spiegel and Murphy   don't have that track record.Niu:Right. Zuckerberg has definitely earned some respect.   He's really demonstrated that he can execute on these   bigger-picture strategies and growing Facebook in the way that he   has. The stock split thing is funny because, like you were   saying, he voted it in personally, single-handedly. It doesn't   matter if you didn't like the stock split, which hasn't actually   occurred yet even though it's been approved, because he said it   would happen. But, yeah, you really need to trust   these founders. And Spiegel is 26 or 27. Of course,   Zuckerberg was too, a few years back. But, to your point, he just   doesn't have a track record. And it's like, what has he done   beyond creating Snapchat? You can't really point to any single   great business move and be like, ""That was a really smart   strategy, that was a really good move."" You know? You have to   have a lot of faith.Lewis:One of the other things I'm seeing a lot of people talk   about, digging through the S-1 and doing their homework on the   company, is the company's cloud strategy.Niu:Yeah, this is really an interesting topic for me because   Snapchat is doing something that's really unprecedented in terms   of how they're approaching their cloud infrastructure. Most of   the time, when companies are launching these apps and online   services and consumer-based products, eventually, when they get   to a certain point, they start investing in their own   infrastructure, either by building their own data centers and   servers in co-located facilities that they share with other   companies, or building their own. Facebook is building its   seventh data center, and it's fully owned. Twitter co-locates its   data centers. Snap is not doing any of that. Snap is relying 100%   on third-party cloud infrastructure providers, Google Cloud andAmazonAWS. It's just crazy because the scale at which they're   operating, it would normally make sense to start investing in it   yourself, but Snap is content to basically continue to do this   through third parties. It's not clear if this is going to work,   because no one has ever tried this before, so it's this huge   experiment, and there are a lot of risks because you don't get to   control your infrastructure in your back end, which is incredibly   important to your business, and you're also spending a ton of   money. Obviously, building the infrastructure yourself costs a   ridiculous amount of money. But over time, it will eventually pay   for itself.So, what Snap is doing is that they committed to spending   $3 billion total over the next five years between Google and   Amazon combined. Google is the primary provider, and Amazon is   basically a backup. They're spending $400 million a year on   Google. The spending commitment with Amazon ramps up, it starts   at like $50 million and then it's $350 million by the end. But   that's a huge spending commitment. This is, very specifically,   their largest cost. If you look at their financials, the cost   revenue is predominantly composed of these infrastructure costs,   and cost revenue is greater than revenue. So, they have a   negative gross margin right now because of this strategy very   specifically. At the same time, because of these long-term   commitments, the pressure is now on for the ad business. You have   to grow ad sales to these levels just to keep up with it, just to   break even on gross profit, before you even start talking about   operating expenses.The pressure to grow the ad business is incredibly high, and   they have almost no experience doing that. So, it's a huge risk   not only operationally, but it's also a huge risk financially. If   you are unable to grow your ad business enough to cover these   costs, you're just going to be hemorrhaging cash. And it doesn't   matter how popular the service is, if you're just blowing through   money and you can't bring in enough to cover these costs, it's   not sustainable. We don't know if they'll be able to do it or   not, but the point is, the risk that's there is insane. They have   to really turn up these ad sales just to cover their spending   commitments.Lewis:Yeah, beyond all of the general investor interest in Snap   that will undoubtedly be there for the next couple years and   beyond, I think there will be a lot of tech insiders watching   this decision. If it works, maybe they'll use it as a blueprint,   and decide that it allows the company to be more nimble. But, you   have to wonder about the company's ability to control costs, and   have total control over what's going on with the IT   infrastructure, because that's how everyone is interacting with   their product.Niu:Yeah. Everyone in the cloud infrastructure market is   watching very closely, because they're like, ""This is crazy, how   much this company is spending."" It's great news for the cloud   infrastructure market, of course, because it's one of the biggest   customers out there. They're bringing in a lot of money, and   everyone is going to see if this can really work. I mean, it's   worth noting that Snap is hedging itself saying it might   eventually -- in the S-1, it says they may choose to invest in   its infrastructure at some point. A few months ago, they   actually poached Amazon's head of data centers for AWS. So, it's   like, there are some hints that they're exploring the idea of   doing their own infrastructure. But, at the same time, it   probably wouldn't be for the next five years because of these   commitments. So, yeah, they're still leaving themselves an   out. But it seems really risky. It might work out great. In   the event that things go down -- let's say the service just   crashes -- that does let them ramp down variable costs with more   flexibility, as opposed to, if you spend all this money to build   all this infrastructure and the service dies for whatever   reason, theoretically, then you would be stuck with all   this infrastructure you paid all this money for. Versus, just   paying it as a variable expense based on usage. So, it's going to   be something that's going to be very interesting to see play out,   not just because of Snap, but also because of the implications   for the bigger companies that are providing these services like   Amazon and Google, alsoMicrosoft. Microsoft would certainly like to get a piece of that spending.   But yeah, I think that has a lot of implications for the   broader infrastructure market.Lewis:To bring it back around to the stock itself and how   we're looking at it, it seems like you and I are in the same   camp here -- we have some concerns over user   growth, the valuation as it's currently being reported,   we'll see what happens after they run through the   roadshow, but the valuation is a little too rich for us to   really even look at too much, also we have a lot of   questions about the competitive risks with   some Facebook and Instagram looming out there, and   possibly being able to just grab features and drop it on their   installed base. Does that wrap how we feel about   Snap? Anything else you want to add in there, Evan?Niu:I don't think Snap's investable, honestly. There are so   many risks, the financials don't make sense, the valuation   doesn't make sense, you get no voting. [laughs] I don't   doubt that shares will pop from the offering just because of   the hype, but as we've seen with many overhyped IPOs in   recent years, it only takes a few months for the market to   sober up. Plus, Snap's also doing a different thing with the   lock-up period. Employees will be able to sell sooner -- the   lock-up expires for employees sooner than is typical.   Normally, it's about 180 days. They're going to allow   their employees to sell at 150 days, along with all the   co-founders. So, there could be some selling pressure as all   these investors and employees cash out. The employees and all the   insiders are going to make a ton of money, but as far   as public investors go, I don't know. It's also worth   mentioning that their stock-based compensation   expenses so far are quite small because they're still   private. I think last year it was something like $30-some   million, which is a tiny proportion of their expenses.   But when companies go public, the liquidity   event triggers a ridiculous increase in stock-based   compensation cost because now that stock is worth so much   more. And that's typical for all companies that go public   -- right after they go public, they have a huge   increase in stock-based comp. That's something to be aware   that is coming. Plus, they're probably going to start   unloading pretty quickly. I don't know, I just don't   see, after the initial honeymoon, how this thing can really   go even further, after it's already at such a ridiculous   level.

Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Sues Uber Over Allegedly Stolen Technology;2/24/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAlphabet Inc's(NASDAQ:GOOG,GOOGL) Waymo is suing Uber for using technology that it claims was stolen from it by a former employee.makeArticleAd();Source:GoogleWaymo, the self-driving car company that belongs to GOOGL, claims that one of Uber's employees stole technology from it and used it for the company's own self-driving car efforts. The company says this employee is Anthony Levandowski.Anthony Levandowski is the founder of Otto. Otto is a self-driving car startup that was created in 2016. Uber bought this startup in 2016 and added Levandowski to its team. Levandowski was a previous employee of the GOOGL car company before founding Otto.According to Waymo, Anthony Levandowski downloaded more than14,000 confidential and proprietary design filesfor its hardware systems six weeks before resigning from the GOOGL company. Among those files were the company's design data for its LiDAR system.Waymo says that it has decided to file a lawsuit against Uber after receiving an email from one of its suppliers. The supplier makes parts for the GOOGL company's LiDAR system. In the email was a picture of a circuit board for Uber's own LiDAR technology. Waymo says this circuit board looked incredibly like the one it created for its own LiDAR system.Waymo says that after conducting some research, it has discovered that other former employees also downloaded confidential information from the company. These employees now work for Uber and Otto. The GOOGL company claims this was an organized act to steal its trade secrets and intellectual property.Waymo also claims that Anthony Levandowski expressed his desire to ""replicate"" the company's technology as a rival. It claims he told employees of this plan months before his retirement.More From InvestorPlace7 Dividend Stocks for the Retirement You Deserve7 Marvelous Mid-Cap Stocks to Buy for the Best of All Worlds10 Super-Safe Dividend Growth Stocks to Buy TodayThe postAlphabet Inc (GOOGL) Sues Uber Over Allegedly Stolen Technologyappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Considering the Snapchat IPO? Go With Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Instead;2/24/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIn a few weeks, theSnapchatIPO will hit the markets, and it seems like a pretty good bet that there will be quite a bit of interest in the deal. But unless you are a mega-wealthy investor or manage a financial institution, you'll likely not get any shares in the offering. Rather, you'll have to buy SNAP in the after-market, when the valuation will probably be much higher.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockSo is it any wonder that IPOs can be a raw deal?That may be true, but when it comes to investing in the big-growth opportunities, there really is no need to speculate in the IPO market. Hey, there are a variety of interesting stocks currently on the market that should be good enough.Take a Look at GOOGL StockOne to consider is actuallyAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG). Granted, the company is fairly mature, having been founded in 1998.But what's important about GOOGL stock is that the company has global brand, scale, infrastructure and massive user base to play in critical growth markets. Such factors are must-haves for getting the attention of sponsors, especially those that have massive budgets.The 10 Best Stock Charts on Wall Street Right NowThis is why a company likeTwitter Inc(NYSE:TWTR) has struggled so much. In fact, in the latest quarter, the company's revenues increased by a mere0.9% on a year-over-year basisto $717.2 million, marking the 10th consecutive quarter of top-line deceleration. U.S. revenues fell by 4% to $440 million and of course, the company has yet to generate a profit on a GAAP basis.All this happened even though there were major catalysts from the presidential election, NFL streaming and the holiday season.By comparison, in thelatest quarterAlphabet reported an impressive 22% jump in revenues to $26.1 billion and GAAP earnings of $5.33 billion, or $7.56 per share on GOOGL stock.But this shouldn't be much of a surprise. The fact is that GOOGL is positioned nicely for major growth categories like video (YouTube), mobile (Android, Google Play and Waze), devices (Pixel and Google Home) and cloud computing. All these represent multi-billion-dollar market opportunities - and should all provide nice long-term drivers for GOOGL stock.Just look at Waze, which Alphabet Inc purchased for $1.3 billion back in October 2013. Interestingly enough, this price tag may have been a bargain! Note that GOOGL plans to launch a ride-hailing service- similar toUber's- in various cities in the U.S. that is based on the Waze platform.By the way, back in 2013, the company also invested $258 million in Uber.Although, when it comes to GOOGL stock, the real play is likely to be the impact from the company's major investments in deep learning and AI (artificial intelligence). Let's face it, Alphabet has a big-time advantage because of its experience in handling massive amounts of information with search.Already GOOGL is introducing great AI products, such as its Assistant offering (the app allows for sophisticated natural language conversations). But the company has also included more than 350 AI features across many of the company's other products during 2016.According to Alphabet Inc CEOSundar Pichai: ""As I've shared before, computing is moving from a mobile-first to AI-first with more universal ambient and intelligent computing that you can interact with naturally, all made smarter by the progress we are making with machine learning.""More importantly, GOOGL stock is currently trading at an attractive valuation. Consider that the forward price-to-earnings ratio is roughly 22X. Although, if you strip out the $86 billion in the bank, the multiple is 19. And this is roughly in line with Wall Street's 19% five-year forecasted growth rate.OK, then what about Snap? True, growth is ramping at a rapid pace. But then again, the company has only recently begun to monetize its user base, so it does not take much to generate huge spikes.Nordstrom, Inc. (JWN) Stock Looks Great After Q4 EarningsYet it appears that - based on estimates fromGoldman Sachs Group Inc(NYSE:GS) - Snap will churn out roughly$2 billion in revenues in 2018. But this will still mean that the company will trade at over 10 times revenues on atwo-year forward basis. As for GOOGL stock, it is currently at a price-to-sales multiple of 6.4X.So again, if you don't get shares of Snap (and you probably won't - at least the at the offering price), then it's no big deal. Buying GOOGL stock should be just fine.Tom Taulli runs the InvestorPlace blogIPO Playbookand also has his own free iOS app to estimate your tax refund, which is atPathwayTax.com.Follow him on Twitter at@ttaulli.

Aiphabet's Waymo Alleges Uber of Theft of Confidential Files;2/24/2017;"Alphabet Inc.'sGOOGLWaymo has sued Uber and its subsidiary Otto, alleging intellectual property theft and patent violation.In a lawsuit filed Thursday in San Francisco federal court, Waymo accused that former manager at Google's self-driving car project, Anthony Levandowski, had downloaded over 14,000 highly confidential and proprietary files before leaving to work at his newly formed self-driving truck company Otto.Waymo claimed that Levandowski downloaded 9.7 GB of confidential files and trade secrets consisting of design files, blue prints and test documentation from a Google-issued laptop to an external drive and formatted the laptop to delete forensic fingerprints.Waymo also alleged other Google employees who joined Otto to have stolen trade secrets. The company claims that without those stolen stuff, Otto's technology, which forms an important part of Uber's efforts to roll out autonomous vehicles for its ride sharing service, wouldn't have evolved.Alphabet Inc. Net Income (TTM)Alphabet Inc. Net Income (TTM)|Alphabet Inc. QuoteStemmed from an Accidental CC-ingA supplier had mistakenly included a Waymo employee on an e-mail chain that was supposed to be delivered to the Uber team. The attached ""OTTO FILES"" comprised a drawing of a self-driving car Light Detection And Ranging (LIDAR) circuit board quite similar to the one Waymo has been developing secretly.Waymo's lawsuit states that ""The sudden resignations from Waymo, Otto's quick public launch with Mr. Lewandowski at the helm, and Uber's near-immediate acquisition of Otto for more than half a billion dollars all caused Waymo grave concern regarding the possible misuse of its intellectual property.""Reigniting the ConflictThe two camps once lived in harmony. Alphabet executive David Drummond joined Uber's board in 2013 when Alphabet's venture capital arm GV, then Google Ventures, invested $258 million in the company and planned to include Uber rides in the Google Maps app.However, things started to go wrong when Uber decided to develop its own mapping and driverless car technology. The company has opened a technology center in Pittsburgh and hired some robotics specialists from Carnegie Mellon University. It also collaborated with automakers such as Volvo and acquired Otto.Google on the other hand launched a pilot project that enables carpooling in San Francisco Bay Area. Available through Google-owned maps app, Waze, the service is presently under beta testing with a handful of Bay Area companies including Adobe and Google itself. Drummond stepped down from Uber's board last year.The lawsuit certainly complicates the ongoing clash between two of the early leaders in the autonomous vehicle space. Well established car companies like FordF, ToyotaTMand General MotorsGMon the other hand have just started to make their way into this market.Currently, Alphabet shares carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Facebook (FB) Launches Mid Roll Video Ads Beta Testing;2/24/2017;"Facebook IncFBsaid that it will now insert mid roll ads in its video content but as a  ""beta test"" for the time being.In a blog post, Facebook said ""We want to help our partners monetize their premium video content, both on Facebook and on their own websites and apps. The company further stated ""As the name implies, Ad Breaks allows creators to take short breaks for ads during their live videos. When a broadcaster chooses to take an ad break, people watching the video will see an in-stream ad of up to 15 seconds in length. The broadcaster will earn a share of the resulting ad revenue.""Facebook added that the feature will now be accessible to more Live creators. Only Pages and profiles with over 2k followers and 300 Plus views for recent live video can beta test mid roll ads. The first ad break can be taken only after the video has been live for a minimum of four minutes and for more ad breaks, there has to be at least a gap of five minutes between each ad break. Ad breaks will last up to 20 seconds. Ad breaks beta testing will be available only in the U.S for the time being.Analysts observe that ever since Facebook has opted out of pre-roll ads, most publishers haven't been able to earn money from their videos on the social networking platform. Plus, it has kept sports publishers from running ""valuable content"" on the platform.  With mid roll ads, Facebook is giving publishers an opportunity to make more money. Reports add that Facebook will share revenues with publishers in a 45:55 ratio, similar to that of Alphabet'sGOOGLYouTube.Facebook is aggressively promoting ""Live"" in order to boost its top line further. Facebook is trying to bring more video content to attract more ad dollars. Ad revenues contribute over 95% to Facebook's total revenue. It intends to capture the opportunity presented by ever increasing video viewing on social media platforms.

The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights: Alphabet, Intel, NVIDIA, Baidu and Microsoft;2/24/2017;"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL - February 24, 2017 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog includeAlphabet(NASDAQ:GOOGL-Free Report),Intel(NASDAQ:INTC-Free Report),NVIDIA(NASDAQ:NVDA-Free Report),Baidu(NASDAQ:BIDU-Free Report) andMicrosoft(NASDAQ:MSFT-Free Report).Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations.Get #1Stock of the Day pick for free.Here are highlights from Thursday's Analyst   Blog:Google Finds 'Waze' to Build Self-Driving TechnologyWhen asked some time back about the use cases for self-driving cars, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL-Free Report) executives said that they were exploring alternatives. Things have changed somewhat since then and we have slightly greater clarity on whether Google will maintain its own fleet, renting out for delivery of goods, food and/or passenger transport, or whether it will rent vehicles from their makers and sell those services itself.My bet was always on the latter, first because Google is primarily a technology company and thrives on making the kind of software that can take over our lives. Getting into the low-margin business of vehicle maintenance and renting just isn't its area of expertise.Furthermore, the kind of investment that is going into getting these animals on the road isn't justified unless there is a lucrative business out there with a relatively quick payback time.So the company's initial step toward commercialization by getting key people on board and announcing the name of the unit as Waymo was heartening. The goal of this unit is to develop self-driving technology for car makers.How Does All This Tie In with the Waze Carpool   Service?Waze was an Israeli crowd-sourced mapping service providing users with information such as traffic, road conditions and other helpful pointers, so they could quickly decide their route. At least that's what it was in 2013 when Google acquired it for $1.15 billion.Today, Waze is also a carpooling service that gets people travelling in the same direction to travel together and share the cost of gas. So yes, there are headaches to availing the service like having to book way in advance or not having anybody to pick one up on occasion. It also doesn't allow anyone to become a driver, so they can't make a living from it.All this goes to show that Google's plans in the area probably aren't crystallized and the service is a temporary measure to access that all-important thing these days called data. Data that can add to the treasure trove Google's already collecting through the test driving of its self-driving cars.The difficulties don't seem to have deterred users, however, because Google just announced the expansion of the service to unannounced locations in the U.S. and Latin America. And while not all Waze users are signing up for carpooling, it's significant that their numbers have reportedly swelled from 45 million in 2013 to 75 million today. So even if a small percentage of this growing number of people goes for it, it can still be a compelling number.Taxi Service Is What Uber, Lyft Do WellThere's no doubt about it, these two companies have been growing in leaps and bounds as the convenience and quality of service have attracted more and more people. So the prospect of other, perhaps cheaper (because a self-driving car doesn't need a driver) services coming online certainly isn't good news.Google was an initial investor in Uber, but when the company started developing self-driving technology to save its neck, Google representative David Drummond removed himself from its board. Uber still uses Google mapping services, but has increased investments to develop maps of its own.ConclusionUber and its pals have popularized the concept of ride-hailing/car-sharing services but now that the concept has caught on, there will be new entrants. This is a big opportunity for car makers because this is the space where new cars will be deployed in the future.On the technology side, there is the need for machine learning and cloud support, mapping technology, and sensors, which have to be installed on cars built to house the technology. And that's exactly why companies like Intel (NASDAQ:INTC-Free Report) are tying up with companies like Mobileye, while NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA-Free Report) pairs up with Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU-Free Report) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT-Free Report). Then of course there's Google. These companies are in turn testing the technology through collaboration agreements with automakers.But who will get there first? Industry watchers don't expect anything viable until 2020. Even if it's a couple of years out from there, it does look like there will be more than one approach/technology driving the experience. And since the possibilities are tremendous, there won't necessarily be a single winner.Google, Microsoft, Intel and NVIDIA all have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now.

Facebook Inc Stock (FB) Pulls Back After Another High: Now What?;2/24/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFacebook Inc(FB) stock apparently hit a ceiling when it touched yetanother record high- the second record high in less than a month.makeArticleAd();FB shares soared to $136.79 on Wednesday before retreating on Thursday. The previous all-time high for Facebook stock was $135.49, which was set on February 2.Facebook's Stock Move is Just Part of a Wider Tech TrendFB shares also managed a new record closing price on Wednesday at $136.12, ahead of the previous record set on February 8, which was $134.20.As Facebook stock retreated on Thursday, so did most of the other big tech names that have also set record highs this year.Microsoft Corporation(MSFT),Amazon.com, Inc.(AMZN),Netflix, Inc.(NFLX),Alphabet Inc(GOOG) andApple Inc.(AAPL) were all in the red at the time of this writing.And all these big tech names are rising and falling pretty much in tandem with major indices, including theS&P 500,NASDAQ CompositeandDow Jones Industrial Average.Facebook Stock Could Drop Off SoonSo will Facebook stock be able to keep up themomentumfor the near future?Apple Inc. vs. Alphabet Inc: Value or Growth?Seeking Alphacontributor Damon Verial warns that it might not, particularly because it almost always loses in March. He describes himself as ""strongly bullish"" on the name but adds that he only feels ""the urge to write about"" it when he thinks it is overvalued.He says he did call a pullback in Facebook stock in the past when it fell $10 to $123 per share over the four days following his call. Then it fell to $115 over the next two weeks.Of course the stock rallied, as he says it ""always"" will, but he notes that anyone who held through that pullback ""missed a significant buyback opportunity that would have more than accommodated a transition from capital gains tax on long-term holdings to income tax on short-term holdings for most sizable positions.""Verial noted that Facebook Inc (FB) stock has been in overbought territory since the end of January, which means it probably won't take much to set off a downward spiral. He pointed to seasonal patterns in data on the stock showing where it almost always goes in each month.According to him, Facebook stock almost always ends January in the green, and its highest Sharpe ratio also is in January. Average gains during the month stand at 10%.But in February, he said the stock's Sharpe ratio has fallen to zero, making the month neutral. Then in March, the Sharpe ratio turns negative, ""hinting at a significant opportunity cost."" He adds that even long-term holders may find it beneficial to avoid the stock during the worst months, which includes March, May and August. These months aren't usuallyearningsmonths anyway, and they're well after the holiday season at a time when spending on digital advertising starts to fall.He does feel that long is the only ""logical"" position to take on Facebook when looking at it from a long-term fundamental perspective.The postFacebook Stock Pulls Back After Touching Another Record Highappeared first onValueWalk.Many academics claim investing is a ""random walk.""

Qualcomm, Inc. (QCOM) Stock Has Big Prospects Despite Its Problems;2/24/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIt's a bittersweet victory, to be sure. Just whenQualcomm, Inc.(NASDAQ:QCOM) starts to unveil a game-changing technology, a legal hurricane starts to make landfall. If any current or would-be owners of QCOM stock are torn as to what the future likely holds, there's good reason.makeArticleAd();Source:Karlis Dambrans via FlickrAnd yet, as much jeopardy as the company's bottom line may be in at this time, the fact that Qualcomm stock is still down more than 25% over the past three years suggests the market saw a litigation headwind coming sooner or later. The worst-case scenario may already be priced into QCOM stock, which means the recent weakness makes for a compelling entry point.The BadThe legal wrangling is mostly withApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL), superficially. But, should Apple be successful with its effort, it opens the door to other litigation, not to mention emboldens a similar case being brought against Qualcomm by the Federal Trade Commission.The short version of the story: Apple (and the FTC and the Korea Fair Trade Commission, for that matter) are all arguing the same thing - Qualcomm's business model of licensing its technologies to phonemakers isnot only exorbitant, but unlawfully stifles competition. That's a legal no-no in most any country. The Korea Fair Trade Commission isseeking $873 million for essentially the same.The 10 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold ForeverFor the record, QCOM has lost this argument before. In 2015, thecompany forked over $975 million to Chinafor breaking that country's antitrust laws. Indeed, Qualcomm wasallegedly charging all-encompassing licensing feesto phonemakers that may or may not have needed access to all of the technology in that IP package… another dubious practice.Years of sharp dealing have finally caught up with Qualcomm.The GoodThe irony is, while the company was over-milking its aging patent portfolio, QCOM was also developing some new - and highly marketable - intellectual property.The idea of the Internet of Things (IoT) is an exciting one, but the reality is, the technology and bandwidth needed to meet the need just isn't ready, yet. Or, it wasn't anyway. This week, Qualcommunveiled its 802.11ax technology, which can carry four times the amount of data current Wi-Fi technology carries, but without using any more bandwidth.Qualcomm Technologies VP Rahul Patel explained:It is taking Wi-Fi to a new level from a user-experience point of view. What it is trying to do is prepare the Wi-Fi network, which in many cases is experiencing a lot of congestion, largely because the network is becoming dense and is not able to deal with the amount of traffic.At the same time, the company has created a whole new kind of RF ""front end,"" or the radio connection between a mobile phone's modem and the transceiver. Not only is it a superior solution to current alternatives, it's a simpler solution that works with a variety of connection protocols, such as LTE and MIMO, by the utilization of modem intelligence.They're not the kind of advances the average consumer cares about, or even understands. With 5G connectivity about to become the norm, however, these little advances are actually big advances that phonemakers will desperately need.Bottom Line for QCOM StockIn simplest terms, the future of QCOM stock lies somewhere between the two ends of this good/bad continuum. One way or another, sooner or later, Qualcomm's business model of leveraging an aging patent portfolio - and doing so in a questionable manner - is going to falter. If the company wants to continue being an IP player, it's going to need some new IP.The question is, will 802.11ax and new RF front-end platforms be enough? It matters, simply becausethe company's licensing and royalty revenue is roughly twice its revenue from outright chip sales.3 Stocks That Could Soar on a Short SqueezeThe answer to this question is a qualified yes; the qualification is the speed with which lawsuits will result in a decision, and the time that will be needed for IoT and 5G to reach critical mass. Odds are good the former will hurt before the latter helps, meaning Qualcomm could be headed for a dry spell, earnings-wise.Still, for the true long-termer who can stomach the ""in the meantime"" volatility, the market may start to appreciate the potential of the distant future now…after a few years of strong bearish pressure.QCOM stock may not be appropriate for grandma's retirement portfolio, but there's little doubt the company's new technologies will be crucial to the next generation of connectivity.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceApple Inc.

Will Your Next New Car Help Build Maps for Self-Driving?;2/23/2017;"Mobileye N.V.(NYSE: MBLY) , an Israeli company that specializes in advanced   driver-safety systems, has begun rolling out a new offering that   will help the self-driving cars of the near future function in   more areas -- and your next new car might be enlisted to   help.The new offering, called Road Experience Management, or ""REM,""   is a system that will create highly detailed maps that   self-driving cars can use to back up (or double-check) the inputs   from their sensors. It will use data collected by cameras on many   new cars, starting with the 2018 model year.This is a big deal, not just for Mobileye but also for its   customers -- which include nearly all of the world's automakers   -- and people who are hoping to have access to self-driving cars   in the near future.makeArticleAd();Mobileye's chief technology officer, Amnon Shashua, outlined     the company's approach to self-driving in a presentation last     month. Image source: Mobileye N.V.The problem: Self-driving cars need special mapsWhen the first fully self-driving cars arrive on the market in   a few years, their capabilities will be limited. In most cases,   the cars will be ""geofenced,"" restricted to driving in particular   areas. (In the widely used industry nomenclature, these are   called ""Level 4"" systems. ""Level 5"" systems that are self-driving   with no restrictions are probably still many years away.)The cars will be geofenced because most of the self-driving   systems under development require specialized high-definition   maps to work safely. The maps help the car's ""brain"" figure out   exactly where it is relative to things like curbs and road   barriers, providing a layer of redundancy beyond the car's   sensors. (That may sound, well, redundant. But it's critical to   ensuring that self-driving systems meet the required standards of   safety.)Obviously, the companies that can access the best and most   extensive maps will have a competitive advantage. Cars equipped   with their systems will be able to drive themselves to more   places. That means that the race is on not only to create maps   covering the widest possible areas, but to create ways to ensure   that the maps are always up to date.Mobileye has a direct stake in this race. It's gearing up to   bring aLevel 4 system to market by the end of 2019, in partnership withDelphi Automotive(NYSE: DLPH) andIntel(NASDAQ: INTC) . That system will be marketed to automakers, who   will probably be able to have it in showrooms (or in service with   ride-hailing companies) by about 2021.This self-driving test vehicle incorporates a prototype of     the system being developed by Delphi, Mobileye, and Intel.     Image source: Delphi Automotive PLC.The partners will almost certainly have competition from   companies likeAlphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Waymo unit,Ford Motor Company's(NYSE: F)Argo AI subsidiary-- and likely others.Mobileye's Road Experience Management initiative is intended   to make sure that its Level 4 offering is as complete, and as   compelling, as possible. And your next new car might help.How Mobileye will build -- and profit from -- the mapsThe idea behind REM is that Mobileye can use the cameras on   existing cars as a low-cost way to harvest the data needed to   make the maps, as well as other information that will be useful   to self-driving cars. Many new cars have front-facing cameras   that are used for adaptive cruise control, lane-departure   warnings, and other advanced driver-assist systems (or ""ADAS"") --   and many of those camera-based systems were sold to the   automakers by Mobileye.In recent months, Mobileye has been reaching out to its   automaker clients, inviting them to join the REM effort by   allowing data from their vehicles to be collected. In exchange,   Mobileye is offering a share of the revenue it expects to   generate from selling that data to mapmaking companies.So far,Volkswagen AGandBMW AGhave signed up to allow REM to gather data from their vehicles,   starting in the 2018 model year. Duringthis past week's earnings call, Mobileye's CTO Amnon Shashua said that his company expects to   announce a third deal within a few weeks, and to have the   majority of its automaker partners signed up by the end of 2017.   (These deals include extensive privacy safeguards; the data won't   be linked to specific car owners.)Shashua explained how revenue will be generated from the REM   effort:We believe revenue will be generated from two separate     products [of REM]. One is the map, which is a critical input to     autonomous vehicle systems. The other is a broad set of     real-time dynamic information such as traffic density, weather     conditions and open parking spots. We expect the primary     customers for each of these products to be mapmakers, and we     recently announced engagements with both [high-definition     mapping company] HERE and the Japanese mapping company     Zenrin.The upshot: An important step as the self-driving race shapes   upAssuming that a majority of the world's major automakers do in   fact join the REM program, Mobileye's effort stands to put its   venture with Delphi and Intel in a strong competitive position as   the market for self-driving systems takes shape.I've argued that the idea of a ""race"" to self-driving   technologyisn't a useful way for investors to think. Level 4 systems will be available to all automakers within four   or five years; there won't be much advantage to the company that   comes to market first. We won't be able to think in terms of   ""winners"" until the details of the different offerings become   clear.That process is starting. REM makes it likely that the   Delphi-Mobileye-Intel offering will have access to maps that   allow it to operate in many areas of the world, right from the   start. For investors, that makes the success of the partners'   system more likely, and an investment in Mobileye -- the purest   play of the three -- a little more compelling.10 stocks we like better than MobileyeWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Google Finds 'Waze' to Build Self-Driving Technology;2/23/2017;"When asked some time back about the use cases for self-driving cars, AlphabetGOOGLexecutives said that they were exploring alternatives. Things have changed somewhat since then and we have slightly greater clarity on whether Google will maintain its own fleet, renting out for delivery of goods, food and/or passenger transport, or whether it will rent vehicles from their makers and sell those services itself.My bet was always on the latter, first because Google is primarily a technology company and thrives on making the kind of software that can take over our lives. Getting into the low-margin business of vehicle maintenance and renting just isn't its area of expertise.Furthermore, the kind of investment that is going into getting these animals on the road isn't justified unless there is a lucrative business out there with a relatively quick payback time.So the company's initial step toward commercialization by getting key people on board and announcing the name of the unit as Waymo was heartening. The goal of this unit is to develop self-driving technology for car makers.How Does All This Tie In with the Waze Carpool Service?Waze was an Israeli crowd-sourced mapping service providing users with information such as traffic, road conditions and other helpful pointers, so they could quickly decide their route. At least that's what it was in 2013 when Google acquired it for $1.15 billion.Today, Waze is also a carpooling service that gets people travelling in the same direction to travel together and share the cost of gas. So yes, there are headaches to availing the service like having to book way in advance or not having anybody to pick one up on occasion. It also doesn't allow anyone to become a driver, so they can't make a living from it.All this goes to show that Google's plans in the area probably aren't crystallized and the service is a temporary measure to access that all-important thing these days called data. Data that can add to the treasure trove Google's already collecting through the test driving of its self-driving cars.The difficulties don't seem to have deterred users, however, because Google just announced the expansion of the service to unannounced locations in the U.S. and Latin America. And while not all Waze users are signing up for carpooling, it's significant that their numbers have reportedly swelled from 45 million in 2013 to 75 million today. So even if a small percentage of this growing number of people goes for it, it can still be a compelling number.Taxi Service Is What Uber, Lyft Do WellThere's no doubt about it, these two companies have been growing in leaps and bounds as the convenience and quality of service have attracted more and more people. So the prospect of other, perhaps cheaper (because a self-driving car doesn't need a driver) services coming online certainly isn't good news.Google was an initial investor in Uber, but when the company started developing self-driving technology to save its neck, Google representative David Drummond removed himself from its board. Uber still uses Google mapping services, but has increased investments to develop maps of its own.ConclusionUber and its pals have popularized the concept of ride-hailing/car-sharing services but now that the concept has caught on, there will be new entrants. This is a big opportunity for car makers because this is the space where new cars will be deployed in the future.On the technology side, there is the need for machine learning and cloud support, mapping technology, and sensors, which have to be installed on cars built to house the technology. And that's exactly why companies like IntelINTCare tying up with companies like Mobileye, while NVIDIANVDApairs up with BaiduBIDUand MicrosoftMSFT. Then of course there's Google. These companies are in turn testing the technology through collaboration agreements with automakers.But who will get there first? Industry watchers don't expect anything viable until 2020. Even if it's a couple of years out from there, it does look like there will be more than one approach/technology driving the experience. And since the possibilities are tremendous, there won't necessarily be a single winner.Google, Microsoft, Intel and NVIDIA all have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now.

This Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Trade Is a Sure Thing;2/23/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsImmediately after the U.S. elections, the consensus was to buy the small caps and financials. The money had to come from somewhere, so Wall Street sold mega-cap tech to chase the trend then. Stocks likeAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) fell, but eventually recovered. GOOGL stock even set a new all-time high. Then came earnings season.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockThe reaction to GOOGL earnings was brutal - shares fell 6% in four days. Luckily, GOOGL bulls stepped in and defended the stock. As a result, Alphabet Inc has all but erased the entire post-earnings dip.I've always said that the short-term reaction to earnings is purely a gamble. And that the longer-term fundamentals will eventually prevail.My interpretation of Alphabet earnings is that the Google machine is still on rails! It prints money from multiple assets that have more than a billion users; management is a proven winner; and spending on crazy ventures has abated. Alphabet now even have official structures to profit from the self-driving auto arena.3 Covered Calls to Squeeze Dividends Out of Thin AirSo, for the long term, I have no real worry for GOOGL stock other than the general equity market gyrations. If markets sell off, so will GOOGL. Conversely, I don't expect shares to fall too far on their own from the company's own actions.GOOGL Options PlayOptions are liquid enough to allow me to set in motion trades with ample buffers that I expect to be sure winners given the current environment. The trick is to find a level where GOOGL stock will be defended by fundamental investors. Then I sell risk against those levels and sit back and let time work for me.You've read the statistic that most options expire worthless. So I'd want to be a seller of options since the buyers lose most often.The Bet:Sell the GOOGL Jan 2018 $660 put. This is a bullish trade for which I collect $13 per contract to open. The 20% buffer from current price gives this trade a 95% theoretical chance of success. Selling naked puts is dangerous. Not everyone is comfortable exposing themselves to such downside risk. If GOOGL stock falls below my sold put, I am committed to owning the stock at that level. So anything below $647 per share would accrue losses if GOOGL falls 30% or so.Since risk tolerances vary, I will offer an alternate trade with similar metrics but with a finite risk profile. The alternate version would better fit smaller accounts, too.The Alternate:Sell the GOOGL Jan 2018 $670/$660 credit put spread. This, too, is a bullish trade for which I collect $1.25 per contract to open. The price buffer is about the same, so the theoretical chance of success is still more than 90%. If successful, this trade yields 14% on money risked. I still need GOOGL stock to stay above my sold spread to win.Usually, I like to balance my trade by selling opposite risk. In this case, I will offer the option to do that, but I will delay entry a little in this ""animal spirited"" equity market.The Hedge (Optional):Sell the GOOGL Jan 2018 $1060/$1080 credit call spread. This is a bearish trade for which I collect $1.50 per contract to open. I need GOOGL to stay below my sold strike to win. There is no $10 wide spread available yet, so I can't make it a perfect iron condor. This trade, if successful, can yield 8% on money risked.How to Trade Facebook Inc for 470% ReturnsUsually, in perfect iron condors, my potential yield would almost double because I can only lose on one side or the other. In this case, the two sides will balance, but not perfectly. I am not required to hold these options trades through expiration. I can close any of them for partial gains or losses.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director ofSellSpreads.com. As of this writing, he did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Apple Inc. vs. Alphabet Inc: Value or Growth?;2/23/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsChoosing between buyingApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) andAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL) is the classic choice between value and growth. And if you were confused, AAPL stock is the value play, while GOOGL stock provides the growth.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockWhile Apple shares have been on fire in 2017 - up 17% - you can still get in for a price-to-earnings ratio around 16, lower than what investors are paying for the averageS&P 500stock. You also get a dividend of 57 cents per share, more than covered by earnings.GOOGL is the growth play. Revenues increased to $90 billion last year from $55 billion in 2013. This justifies a P/E of nearly 30. The shares are also up 17% over the last 12 months.Right now, investors prefer value over growth and Apple stock is doing better than Alphabet. But this isn't the proverbial choice between a rock and a hard place, instead, it's more like picking between cookies and ice cream. I own both stocks, I have owned them for several years, and I have profited handsomely holding both.The Case for AAPL StockNo technology company is as adept at squeezing profit from hardware as Apple.While other smartphone companies struggle to make money, Apple regularly brings $1 of every $4 in iPhone sales to its bottom line. Its closed ecosystem is perceived as safe and their products last for years.7 Ultra-Cheap Value Stocks to Buy NowThe current case for Apple stock, however, has little to do with hardware. Instead,services now drivethe stock forward. Services like its app store - from which it takes a 30% cut of sales - Apple Music, iPay and iCloud have become huge, with $7.17 billion of revenue in the fourth quarter alone. The success of its services enabled Apple to become a power in the cloud by putting more than$12 billioninto capital spending last year. It's no secret that the cloud is a capital-intensive business, but Apple has been able to out-spend cloud rivals without disturbing its profit machine.AAPL hadover $246 billion in cashon its books at the end of last year, most of it kept overseas. The Trump administration has proposed a one-time tax cut to encourage Apple to bring this cash back to the U.S. That's enough money to buy companies such asComcast Corporation(NASDAQ:CMCSA) orWalt Disney Co(NYSE:DIS) outright.When analysts subtract the Apple cash from its market cap, they find the company itself valued at ""just"" $460 billion, with a PE of 9 and just over two times sales. If you're looking for a cheap value stock, poised for an era of unprecedented growth, with plenty of safety and margin for error, they say, buy AAPL today.The Case for GOOGL StockThe artists formerly known as Google have a different case to make.Alphabet has become acash flow monster, delivering nearly $40 billion in operating cash flow last year. Its revenue grew nearly 20%, and GOOGL's operating margin is over 25%.Clouds scale like no invention ever seen before, and Alphabet delivers a global search service for literally nothing. Its Android operating system is on87% of all smartphones, against just 12% for Apple, and Alphabet doesn't have to build or sell them. It just watches as customers who own them come to its services.But with no fanfare, GOOGL has also become a power in hardware. Its Chromebooks now outsell Apple's Macintosh line with about 5% of the PC market. Alphabet now participates in all the hardware markets pioneered by rivals - from virtual reality headsets to streaming devices - with watches and personal assistants that let you conduct searches of your home or the world with just your voice.Under CFO Ruth Porat, who joined the company fromMorgan Stanley(NYSE:MS) in 2015, Alphabet is finally telling investors how much they're spending on ""other bets"" like robots and self-driving cars, and it's working to make money on those ventures.The Bottom LineIt's hard to see a loser here.Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Is Feelings. Nothing More Than Feelings.The perceived threat to Alphabet is the growing balkanization of the Internet, with national governments seeking to control what people see and say within their borders, and who can profit from it. That has yet to impact GOOGL, but even the perception can hurt a stock.AAPL is currently benefiting from a global flight to safety. Its enormous cash position, its strength as a luxury brand, and its growth in services, which could easily be expanded into competition in the cloud with companies such as Alphabet, are all seen in the best light right now.If pushed to the wall and forced to buy just one right now, I would probably go with GOOG, the non-voting version of Alphabet stock, which shares equally in earnings but sells at a $20 per share discount to the GOOGL shares.But both companies are likeGeneral Motors Company(NYSE:GM) was in the 1950s,International Business Machines Corp.(NYSE:IBM) was in the 1960s, andHalliburton Company(NYSE:HAL) was in the last decade. These are their good old days. We know they will end someday, but that day is not today.Dana Blankenhornis a financial and technology journalist.

Is Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM) In a Dividend Aristocrat Bubble?;2/23/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOn May 23, 1719, one of the greatest financial bubbles in the history of the world kicked off when the Compagnie Perpetuelle des Indes was granted a monopoly by the French monarchy over all the trading rights of all French colonies worldwide.makeArticleAd();The company's stock price quickly soared, from 300 livres per share to more than 1,000 just a few months later. It was quite a jump. But the enthusiasm continued for more than 18-months.In fact there was such a frenzy to buy shares that it wasn't uncommon for the stock price to double in a single day. By November, share price had surpassed 10,000.Based on modern-day calculations, a share price of 10,000 livres would have valued the company at more than the entire GDP of France at the time.That would be likeAlphabet Inc(GOOGL) orAmazon.com, Inc.(AMZN) having a $20 TRILLION stock market capitalization today. Insane.As with all bubbles throughout history, that one burst as well… quickly and violently. Call it 'reversion to the mean'. Stein's Law. Or just plain old common sense.It's pretty simple- there are certain anomalies that are too absurd to last. And nature always finds a way to correct them.7 Dividend Stocks for the Retirement You DeserveWhile it's nowhere near as extreme as the Compagnie Perpetuelle des Indes, the market today is also in a completely unsustainable position.I'll show you what I mean-Take a look atExxon Mobil Corporation(XOM); it's one of the largest companies in the world and a favorite among investors due to its 3.7% dividend yield.Quarter after quarter, Exxon Mobile has been paying dividends to its shareholders without fail for decades, even at the peak of the financial crisis.Not only that, but the company has generally increased its dividend each year as well. To stock investors, that kind of consistency is a gold mine. But there's a small problem.For the last several years, Exxon has been borrowing money in order to maintain its dividend payments. Last month, for example, the company reported $26.4 billion in cashflow from its business operations during 2016.But in order to maintain the business, the company had to spend $16.7 billion on what's known in finance as ""capital expenditures"" or ""capex"". Capex is critical to a big business like Exxon Mobil; every year they have to replace old machinery, purchase more land, etc.If they don't do these things, the business will suffer and revenues will decline. So after subtracting the capex, Exxon Mobil had $9.7 billion remaining in ""free cash flow"".Not bad.Except that, according to the company,they paid $12.5 billion in dividends.Hang on a sec. How is it possible that the company could pay $12.5 billion in dividends when they only had $9.7 billion in free cash flow remaining after the capex spending?Easy. They went into debt. Exxon borrowed billions of dollars in order to pay its shareholders a healthy dividend. And they've been doing this for years. Exxon Mobil is FAR from alone.Verizon Communications Inc.(VZ) is another shining example: in 2016, the company earned $22.7 billion from its business operations, but had $17.1 billion worth of capex. That left $5.6 billion remaining. Yet Verizon paid $9.3 billion in dividends.Once again, the company took on billions of dollars in additional debt.This has been a major trend across the biggest companies in the market.There's nothing wrong with debt; sometimes it can be a smart move that creates value for the company.Our manufacturing business in Australia recently took on some debt to buy some new equipment, for example. It's been a great decision; we're able to generate more revenue with less cost, so the overall growth in our profit is multiples greater than the interest payment.But borrowing billions of dollars just to pay out what amounts to sham dividends is a complete waste of money… and irresponsible.It also means that these record high stock prices are artificial, based on debt-fueled dividends and share buybacks instead of healthy free cash flow.This is totally unsustainable.In addition, with an average P/E ratio of 26.5, stock valuations are at their highest level since the financial crisis; it's yet another layer of risk in this market.10 Super-Safe Dividend Growth Stocks to Buy TodayFew people ever got rich buying what was popular and expensive.

2 Reasons Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA) Stock Is Even More Enticing;2/23/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAlibaba Group Holding Ltd(NYSE:BABA) shares continue to move closer to all-time highs thanks to impressive continued growth in China and new international markets. BABA stock is certainly not done running and has a promising future with the company's Cloud division and international expansion.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockAlibaba Australia is the latest in a series of moves to diversify away from China and the company's core business line.BABA opened a headquarters for its Australia/New Zealand operations in Melbourne. The headquarters will help the company expand its already strong relationship with Australia and continue to expand its Cloud offerings outside of China. Alibaba plans on building this headquarters to create operating infrastructure, online payments and cloud computing.Why Alibaba Australia Is Good News for BABABusinesses in Australia and New Zealand have beenusingAlibaba and its Tmall store to get its products into Asia. More than 1,300 Australian brands and 400 brands from New Zealand have products on Tmall. For many of these brands, Tmall was their entry point for China. Australia ranks as the fourth-highest selling country on Tmall, showing the strength of the relationship between it and China.Along with the introduction of a headquarters in Australia, the company hascollaboratedwith Australia Post. This deal will strengthen trade between Australia and Southeast Asia, and ultimately strengthen BABA stock as well. The deal centers around Lazada Group, an Alibaba majority owned subsidiary, that will help bring Australia Post to regions like Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia. Lazada provides merchants direct access to more than 560 million consumers in six countries.7 Ultra-Cheap Value Stocks to Buy NowBrands like Chemist Warehouse, Swisse, and Balckmores areamongthe top brands selling on Tmall from Australia. Popular categories that have helped Australia see strong Chinese sales are health and nutrition, milk power, snacks, coffee and instant beverages.BABA is heavily investing in Australia, with attention being paid to cloud computing and also the selling of goods between Asia and Australia. Alibaba is also actively exploring the real estate market of Australia, which could represent the e-commerce giant's early intentions to take on another area of revenue.The company is considering selling apartments and also facilitating payments for deposits or settlements of apartments through its Alipay payment service. This is just another example of BABA stock spreading itself into new areas through its already existing strengths.The Cloud Computing segment for Alibaba still makes up a fraction of its revenue. However, this unit is fast growing and the company believes it can outpace current worldwide leaderAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN). In the last fullfiscal year, the Cloud Computing segment made up $648 million in revenue. Compare that to the company's Core Commerce division and its $14.7 billion revenue and it doesn't look like much.The investments made by Alibaba in its Cloud division continue to represent the number one reason to buy BABA stock. Alibaba hasplacednew facilities in four regions to help boost its Cloud division. New Cloud facilities are in the United Arab Emirates, Australia, Japan and Germany.In four years, the company believes it can overtake AMZN as the No.1 cloud provider in the world. Alibaba currently ranks first in China and in the top five worldwide.BABA stock recieved some major positive news for the Cloud division, when itsigneda 12-year deal to provide cloud services to the Olympic Games. This deal also covers an e-commerce platform to sell Olympic branded goods. Alibaba is now able to use its dominance in both commerce and cloud to attract new customers and countries for expansion. BABA will also optimize an Olympics Channel for the Chinese audience.Bottom Line on BABA StockThe financial performance of the company's Cloud division continues to amaze and might explain some of the recent gains. In the recent quarter, overall revenue was up 54%. The company's main Core Commerce division gained 45% from the prior year. Cloud revenue grew a brilliant 115%.Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Is Still a Top Tech StockAnother key driver for growth is international commerce, which grew 288% from the prior year. Take what you learned from the company's focus and investment on Australia and both of those great growth figures are headed even higher in 2017.BABA stock investors seem to be missing how important this deal in Australia is and the company's recent cloud infrastructure expansion in new international markets are. China's e-commerce continues to grow and Alibaba is a clear winner. The company is not standing still and staying content with just that growth. China is attacking a high-growth cloud market and will come out victorious.BABA stock has performed well over the last year, rising 54%. Alibaba shares are up 17% in the short 2017 year, yet BABA stock is still up only 10% from its highly valued IPO.With the company's expansion beyond China and just being an online retailer, Alibaba is a big buy for investors. I was bullish nearly a year ago sharing BABA stock as away to investin the growth of the Chinese movie business. That remains true today and with the focus on cloud computing, investors have even more reason to buy this Chinese giant.As of this writing, Chris Katje did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace7 Consumer Stocks That Will Knock Your Socks Off7 Stocks to Sell or Short Before the Bears StrikeThe post2 Reasons Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA) Stock Is Even More Enticingappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Is Still a Top Tech Stock;2/23/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsI'm a firm believer inAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL). In the markets, there is an elite group of companies that define their respective industries. For example,Amazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) owns e-commerce, whileFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) has forever changed social media. And for now,Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) is the king of smart devices. But in my humble opinion, GOOGL stock tops them all.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockDon't get me wrong as this is not a slight against any of the above companies. Just let me forward a very basic observation - all these other names essentially require the internet to function. If not directly, then certainly, access to the internet represents their core marketing message.But what happens when you own the internet? That's a theoretical question to everyone except GOOGL.As I mentioned in a prior contribution, thedominanceof the GOOGL search engine is unparalleled. The margin between Alphabet Inc and the next biggest competitor, Bing, is a whopping 300%. It just gets worse as you go down the rankings. By the time you hit fifth place, it's just not even worth considering. In any other industry, such a statement would be the death knell for the competition.Essentially, GOOGL stock is an investment in life itself. Many people thought that thename changeto Alphabet - a play on the financial term ""alpha"" and the gambling term ""bet"" - was cheeky and a bit ridiculous. But it also signified that Alphabet Inc could do whatever it wants because no one can stop it. GOOGL stock was essentially either an asset or a threat, depending on your perspective.Volatility Is a Risk to GOOGL StockUnfortunately, where it matters most for investors, GOOGL stock hasn't always shown its best stuff. True, it's early into 2017, and so far, it's up over 4% year-to-date. Keep that up every month and you're guaranteed a stellar annual return. But Alphabet Inc has also beeninconsistent, as InvestorPlace contributor Chris Tyler points out. For example, GOOGL was looking at closing January at over 6%. Instead, it only secured 1.4%.7 Ultra-Cheap Value Stocks to Buy NowOn a strictly nominal basis, that's not much of a swing. But on percentage basis, it's a much different story. It has been well over a decade since Alphabet stock introduced itself to the markets. The crazy dynamics involved in a fresh tech company should be over by now. Today, GOOGL and its subsidiaries are comparable toGeneral Electric Company(NYSE:GE) if GE was a little more hip.But with great size comes great envy. Alphabet Inc now faces a fundamental problem.Oracle Corporation(NYSE:ORCL) wants to reengage acourt rulingthat went in favor of GOOGL. At issue is the company's generous use of Oracle's Java software in order to design the Android operating system. GOOGL contends that using Java - which is open-source - is fair game. Oracle contends that it violates the ""fair use "" component of copyright law.For those that acquired GOOGL stock, it's an ugly situation that might be a legitimate risk. Here's the thing - whether it's legitimate or not doesn't matter. If the markets think it's a problem, it's a problem. That makes the sighting of what appears to be a bearish head-and-shoulders pattern (between early December until now) a curious development.Don't Panic on Alphabet IncGenerally, it's not the best idea to buy an investment with baggage. Certainly, it's not a good idea when the baggage is from a giant company like Oracle. Ditto that for its 6'3″ CEO that doesn't come off as someone you want to mess with. In other words, GOOGL stock has some challenges.3 Struggling Stocks That Could Make Epic RunsI also don't think it's a coincidence that the head-and-shoulders pattern is emerging right now. If I'm looking at Alphabet Inc purely as a swing trade, I wouldn't go full bore at this juncture. I expect shares to at least test its 50-day moving average, which stands just under $800. It would not shock me, however, to see GOOGL stock slide towards its 200-day moving average, which is around $763.Again, that's looking at Alphabet Inc from a short-term perspective. For those that have a wider time horizon, the king of the internet is as strong technically as it is fundamentally. Aside from some bumps in the road, GOOGL stock is enjoying clear blue skies. Most importantly, those bumps have never affected Alphabet Inc in a permanent way.The bottom line here is that I would be content holding GOOGL stock. Further, any dips are justifiable buying opportunities, not mere contrarianism for its own sake. Alphabet Inc isgoing to $1,000- just try to ignore the turbulence as best you can.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace7 Consumer Stocks That Will Knock Your Socks Off7 Stocks to Sell or Short Before the Bears StrikeThe postAlphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Is Still a Top Tech Stockappeared first onInvestorPlace."

While this may not be in direct competition with Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX-Free Report) it does look like competition for Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOGL-Free Report) YouTube, Spotify and Pandora (NYSE:P-Free Report). It's also definitely competition for eyeballs in what is limited free time for all-Facebook TV AppFacebook has launched a new TV app for Amazon Fire TV, Apple TV and Samsung Smart TV, with possible plans to further expand to other platforms like Microsoft Xbox, Sony PlayStation and other streaming devices. While this will likely enable/support longer video formats, Facebook has said its intention is not to compete with Netflix but rather to enable Facebook users to watch their preferred video on just about any screen of their choice (and that includes TV screens).Of course that's not the only video announcement Facebook made. The company says that henceforth, videos will play automatically with the sound turned on by default (if the device sound is turned on) and the window will retreat to the bottom corner of the screen so you can keep watching the video while scrolling through your newsfeed. Facebook says that testing is showing a positive reaction from users, although it's obvious that not everyone will be overjoyed.Facebook is also reportedly in talks with music labels to bring their content to the app, which seems like an open challenge to YouTube, Google's competing site. For labels, the new distribution channel will increase their leverage against YouTube for more favorable terms. On the flip side, the chances of piracy will increase given the nature of Facebook's free platform.The increased scope for advertising is also an indication that the company is gearing up to grab its share of TV ad dollars.Apple Getting Ready to Debut Reality ShowEddie Cue, Apple's SVP of Internet software and services used the Recode Media Conference to express a lot of enthusiasm for Apple's soon-to-be released ""Planet of the Apps"" reality show on its music subscription service. Contestants will get 60 seconds to explain their idea on an escalator and could win up to millions in venture capital funding if judges will.i.am, Jessica Alba, Gary Vaynerchuk and Gwyneth Paltrow approve. This is the first attempt by Apple to create original content and will likely be joined by Carpool Karaoke in April (Apple bought out the unscripted version of this show in the summer of last year).Google Fiber RestructuringAlphabet has been trimming staff at its Access unit, which is responsible for its high-speed Internet service called Fiber. But last week, the trimming was more in the nature of hacking as it transferred hundreds of employees to other units, retaining just enough to work in the field. The unit also has a new CEO in Greg McCray, who was formerly CEO of Aero Communications and currently also serves on the board of telecom company CenturyLink.The changes while significant are not really surprising, because Google has had a lot of trouble with Fiber not only because of the expense but also because of tussles with telecom companies over their control on telecom poles. In fact, ever since its acquisition of WebPass last year, speculation has been rife that the company will replace or reduce fiber deployment with a cheaper wireless service. That plan seems to have crystallized now as Google cuts staff but remains committed to expanding its Fiber service.Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations.Get #1 Stock of the Day pick for free.About Zacks Equity ResearchZacks Equity Research provides the best of quantitative and qualitative analysis to help investors know what stocks to buy and which to sell for the long-term.Continuous coverage is provided for a universe of 1,150 publicly traded stocks.

Will Driverless Cars End Traditional Car Ownership?;2/23/2017;"I bought a used car recently, and a few days after I brought   it home, a friend asked me, ""Do you think this is the last car   you'll ever buy?""We talk a lot about self-driving cars, so I knew exactly where   he was going with his question. He was hinting at the   fact that both autonomous car technologies and ride-sharing   services are advancing so quickly that by the time I'd be in   the market for another vehicle, I might not actually need to buy   one.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();By 2035, the IHS estimates there will be 76 million cars on   the road worldwide with some level of autonomy.Even now, semi-autonomous cars that can keep themselves in   their lanes, automatically brake in emergency situations, and   slow down to match the speed of the car in front of themcan be purchasedfor as little as $20,000.And as genuinely driverless cars get cheaper and become   ubiquitous, you and I may opt out of monthly car payments and   opt-in to a monthly mileage subscription service instead.Automakers are investing in this futureTo understand how it's possible that we could soon live in a   world where most people don't own cars, we need to look no   further than what the automakers themselves are doing.Elon Musk's recently updated version ofTesla's(NASDAQ: TSLA)  master plan includes details on a new   service: When the company's vehicles become fully autonomous (by   2018 or 2019, according to Musk), Tesla owners will be able to   allow their vehicles to drive themselves around and be rented out   by other people.As Musk wrote:You will also be able to add your car to the Tesla shared     fleet just by tapping a button on the Tesla phone app and have     it generate income for you while you're at work or on vacation,     significantly offsetting and at times potentially exceeding the     monthly loan or lease cost.Image source: Tesla.Musk also said that Tesla would deploy its own fleet of   driverless vehicles for rent in areas where there was more demand   for Tesla vehicles than privately owned cars could meet, so that    ""you can always hail a ride from us no matter where you   are."" Remember, this isn't the catchphrase of a taxi company, nor   even a ride-hailing service -- but rather the direction where   Musk sees his automaker headed.And just in case think this mentality is unique to the   innovative Tesla, consider whatGeneral Motors(NYSE: GM)  is doing. The giant automaker launched a   ride-sharing service last year called Maven, which allows some GM   owners to rent out their vehicles when they're not in use. The   cars don't drive themselves yet, but the company sees it as a   first step toward a future where people are less inclined to own   cars.In a press release at the time, GM said that more than 25   million of its customers around the world will use some form of   shared mobility by 2020, and describe Maven as ""a key element of   our strategy to changing ownership models in the automotive   industry."" Maven has spread to 17 cities across North America in   just 11 months, has 22,000 members, and has been used for 57   million miles of driving.Not to be outdone,Ford(NYSE: F) has launched i ts own ride-sharing service, and is   developing autonomous cars just like GM. Ford has made it clear   that it intends to launch a ""high-volume"" driverless car paired   with ride-hailing and ride-sharing services by 2021. The   company is already testing 30 self-driving Fusion Hybrids in   several states, and plans to triple the number of test vehicles   this year.Other automakers are moving in this direction as well.Fiat Chrysler(NYSE: FCAU) is working withAlphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google to test a fleet of 100   self-driving minivans that will be the basis for aride-hailing serviceset to launch later this year. It's still unclear what the   service will look like, or if Fiat Chrysler will play a critical   role in it, but what is clear is that the automaker believes in   the viability of Waymo's cars-as-a-service goal.Will this really end car ownership?It's hard to answer this question conclusively, of course.   After all, most people haven't even seen a fully autonomous   vehicle on the road, let alone ridden in one.But John Zimmer, the co-founder and president of   ride-hailing company Lyft,believes thatby 2025 ""private car ownership will all-but end in major U.S.   cities."" Lyft expects the majority of its vehicles to be   self-driving by 2021, and rival Uber is testing similar   strategies as well.Others have set similar timelines for the demise of car   ownership. Georg Bauer, who has held executive positions at   Daimler, BMW, and TeslatoldBusiness Insiderlast year that he thinks car ownership could be dead within   five to 10 years.Government regulations and our own apprehension about giving   up control over our vehicles may preserve the widespread car   ownership culture for longer than some expect. But what's crystal   clear is that tech companies and automakers alike are betting on   an automotive future that looks very different than today. Like   many things, the transition from owning cars to renting   driverless ones on an as-needed basis will likely occur in stages   -- but let's be clear, things are certainly moving in this   direction. And I, for one, would welcome a world without car   payments.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

PowerShares QQQ Trust (QQQ): Short the Titans of Tech;2/23/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe rally inPowerShares QQQ Trust, Series 1 (ETF)(NASDAQ:QQQ) has reached epic proportions as the tech rally moves relentlessly higher on a daily basis. Like all good things, however, it will eventually come to an end. And the end is nigh for the Nasdaq. I expect QQQ to have a meaningful pullback over the coming few weeks.makeArticleAd();QQQ is comprised of the top 100 Nasdaq stocks, with the largest five holdings comprising nearly 40% of the index. These are the heavyweights of tech, with names likeApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL),Microsoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT),Amazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN),Facebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) andAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL).While the valuations given to AMZN and FB have always been rich (or perhaps absurd), now even Apple, the biggest component of the QQQ, is no longer the value stock is was a year ago. AAPL currently sports a price-to-earnings multiple over 16, by far the highest over the past year.Click to EnlargeYear-to-date, the QQQ is up a stunning 10%. To put that in a different context, if the Q's maintained the torrid pace of the rally, it would end up the year with a gain of 97.8%. Of the 34 trading days this year, QQQ has been up 27 days and down only seven.In February, there have been 12 up days and only two down days, with the two down days only being 11 cents and 4 cents.Certainly might be difficult to sustain that type of pace going forward.7 Ultra-Cheap Value Stocks to Buy NowThe Q's are by far the most overbought in the past two years with a 14-day RSI reading over 85. Readings at these extremes are rare indeed, especially for an index or ETF.Click to EnlargeImplied volatility (IV) is priced at the lowest levels over that time frame, meaning option prices are cheap, trading at only 4%. Yesterday saw notable put trading in the QQQ, with an inordinate amount of put selling. This type of action is usually indicative of tops in the underlying shares.So with the Q's at grossly overbought levels and with option prices dirt cheap, taking a bearish position using long put options makes a lot of sense.QQQ Trade IdeaBuy QQQ March $130 puts at $1.50 or better.These are the at-the-money puts and cost only 1.1% the price of the QQQ. With IV at low levels, gamma is high, meaning these options are poised to move. A mere 2% pullback over the coming few weeks would result in a doubler for these options.Those wishing to defray some of the exposure could elect to sell shorter-term weekly options against the long traditional Mar $130 puts.As of this writing, Tim Biggam did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Optimism around autonomous driving and increasing automotive technology continues to rise; there's a reasonTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) stock is near all-time highs. Betting against that in the short-term seemed foolish.That story appears to hold for a little while longer, as Mobileye earnings out Wednesday morning came in ahead of consensus estimates and the company's own guidance. In response, MBLY stock reversed from modest gains to modest losses back to 2%-plus gains again in premarket trading. That seems to imply that investors already are looking forward.But it's there the Mobileye story might have some holes.Mobileye Earnings Look SolidMobileye earnings for Q4 beat both Street consensus and its own guidance on the top and bottom line. Revenue of $104.6 million, in particular, looks impressive. MBLY had guided for roughly $96 million coming out of Q3 in moving expectations to the high end of a full-year $344 million-$350 million range. Heading into the earnings report, analysts largely backed those projections.7 Ultra-Cheap Value Stocks to Buy NowThe beat, then, implies growth roughly 11 points higher than thought, with revenue growing almost 46% year-over-year.The driver (no pun intended) appears to be aftermarket sales. Those sales - largely dash-mounted systems on existing cars, rather than installed systems in new cars - increased 156% year-over-year. MBLY management had raised full-year projections for that division after Q2 to 20% of total sales. In fact, Q4 Mobileye earnings show the aftermarket drove 23% of full-year revenue, with sales increasing 113% for full-year 2016.Earnings per share beat consensus and implied guidance by 2 cents, which implies that profit margins were roughly as expected. The reason likely is that aftermarket sales offer lower gross margins, and thus aren't quite as profitable. MBLY has improved gross margins in the business, but mix seems like the most significant reason why the company didn't better leverage sales growth.Long-Term Questions Remain for MBLY StockThe fact that the revenue beat came from aftermarket growth isn't quite the outcome that Mobileye stock bulls would have preferred for Q4.The exciting business here is in OEM, from both the standpoint of market opportunity and profit margins. While 113% growth for aftermarket sales is nothing to sneeze at, it's still off a rather small base. And $82 million in aftermarket sales for 2016, on its own, isn't near enough to support a stock with an enterprise value over $10 billion.That seems to mean investors are looking forward. 2017 guidance on the conference call is for EPS of $1.01-$1.05 and revenue of $490 million-$505 million. Earnings appear just shy of analyst estimates of $1.04, while revenue of $490 million-$505 million suggests an outperformance to Street expectations of $491 million.That combination, however, means margins will be a bit lower than forecast by analysts. That, in turn, likely comes from a higher-than-expected proportion of aftermarket revenue - again, not what the bulls necessarily wanted to hear.And that may be enough for some of the long-term concerns to enter the narrative in MBLY stock in post-earnings trading.Looking ForwardMorgan Stanley downgraded Mobileye stock at the beginning of the month based on margin concerns - a move that took MBLY stock down 3%. And the ability of Mobileye to maintain margins is a big concern of mine, longer-term.I'm still skeptical that any semiconductor company can hold pricing (and thus margins) longer-term. One of the few exceptions, of course, is Nvidia itself. But Mobileye stock, now trading at ~45x 2017 EPS, still is priced higher than NVDA, and part of Nvidia's huge gains over the past year have come from optimism over prospects for its Drive PX 2 platform.How to Trade Facebook Inc for 470% ReturnsThat platform is what Tesla turned to after its relationship ended with Mobileye (and somewhat acrimoniously). That decision alone illustrates the long-term challenges. Competition will be intense, and pricing will be too. It's important to remember that MBLY is a semiconductor company (though it has software capabilities, admittedly) and an automotive supplier. Neither industry traditionally gets very high earnings multiple, because both businesses are extremely tough.For Mobileye to be an outlier on both fronts, its execution needs to be perfect, and its growth flawless. Mobileye earnings for Q4 show a step in the right direction from that standpoint.But with the earnings beat driven largely by aftermarket sales, that step probably isn't big enough for MBLY stock to take another step higher.As of this writing, Vince Martin did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace7 Tech Stocks That Could Implode at Any Minute9 Top Pharmaceutical Stocks to Buy for the Dividends7 Dividend Stocks for the Retirement You DeserveThe postMobileye NV Q4 Earnings Are Good Enough for Now, But …appeared first onInvestorPlace."

Could Apple Inc. (AAPL) Be The First Ever $1 Trillion Company?;2/22/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsI stumbled across a prediction last week that would impress even Mad Money's Jim Cramer.makeArticleAd();According to a recent report from Oxfam, an international charitable organization, Bill Gates has a shot at becoming the world's first trillionaire. Oxfam speculates that if the returns on the tech mogul's $75 billion fortune in the next 25 years are similar to those in the last 25 years, Gates has a shot at jumping the $1 trillion mark.That got me thinking, if one man has a shot at becoming a trillionaire, certainly one of theS&P 500′s biggest companies has a shot at becoming the world's first $1 trillion company?Turns out, a few do.I see five S&P 500 companies with a shot at breaking the $1 trillion mark in the next five years.-Facebook Inc(FB) is the smallest company on the list with a market cap of $386 billion. Facebook's share price would need to hit $345, up 159%.-Amazon.com, Inc.(AMZN) has a market cap of $400 billion. Shares would need to hit $1,980, up 125%.-Microsoft Corporation(MSFT) has a market cap of $498 billion. Shares would need to hit $130, up 100%.-Alphabet Inc(GOOG) is currently worth $570 billion. Shares would need to hit $1,431, up 70%.I believe every one of these companies will eventually be worth $1 trillion. However, one other company will beat them all to it.Thanks to a variety of factors,Apple Inc.(AAPL) is set to become the first $1 trillion company in the world in the next five years.The company has been on a roll. After beating fourth-quarter earnings by 4%, shares just hit a new all-time high above $135.That gives Apple a market cap of $710 billion, making it the largest company in the S&P 500. It has also placed Apple within striking distance of the $1 trillion mark. Shares of Apple would only need to climb 50% to $200 to give it a market cap of $1 trillion.7 Tech Stocks With Explosive Growth PotentialThat is well within reach.If its current valuation stayed the same, Apple would need to grow earnings by 8% annually in the next five years to hit that target. As it stands, Apple is expected to grow earnings by 8% this year and another 13% in 2018. Those two years alone get Apple almost half way to 50% earnings growth.But even if Apple's earnings grow slower than expected, it has an ace up its sleeve.Apple Has $246 Billion In Cash On Its Balance SheetApple's cash position is larger than the GDP of most countries. In recent fourth-quarter results, Apple's reported a cash position of $246 billion. Some of that cash is already accounted for in Apple's $700 billion valuation. But not all of it.Using as little as half of its cash balance to repurchase shares adds another $125 billion to Apple's market cap.Apple's Is One Of The Most Undervalued Stocks In The S&P 500Apple is one of the most undervalued stocks in the S&P 500. Its forward P/E ratio of 15 is a discount to the S&P 500s 20. That lower valuation exists despite the fact that Apple is projected to grow earnings faster than the S&P 500 in the next five years.Technically speaking that means Apple should be trading with a higher P/E ratio than the S&P 500. If Apple traded with the same P/E ratio as the S&P 500, shares would shares would climb 25%, giving Apple a market cap of $887 billion.Warren Buffett Just Made A Huge Investment In AppleApple's pursuit of the $1 trillion threshold has attracted the attention of the world's greatest investor. In recent regulatory filings, Berkshire revealed it had quadrupled its ownership in Apple to 57 million shares. Buffett's stake was worth approximately $6.6 billion at the end of 2016.With shares of Apple already up 17% on the year, Buffett has pocketed a quick $1.1 billion gain in less than six weeks.7 Dividend Stocks for the Retirement You DeserveRisks To Consider:Apple has struggled to launch new hits in the last few years. Although sales growth in its most important product the iPhone is still strong, Apple isn't the innovative company it was under Steve Jobs.Action To Take:Apple is on pace to become the world's first $1 trillion company. Even though shares are trading at an all-time high, I see plenty of growth and gains ahead. Buy shares anywhere below the all-time high and hold until Apple becomes the first $1 trillion company in the world.Editor's Note:Tech companieshave a history of turning stockholders, secretaries and even janitors into ""overnight"" millionaires.In 2017, innovations in virtual reality will do the same for owners of these 2 stocks…StreetAuthority's mission is to help individual investors earn above-average profits by providing a source of independent, unbiased - and most of all, profitable - investing ideas.

Mark Your Calendars: This Is When You Can Buy the Snap IPO;2/22/2017;"The most highly anticipated IPO of the year finally has a date   set to begin trading.Snap(NYSE: SNAP) will price its shares on March 1after the market closes, which means investors should be able to buy shares on March   2.Snap expects to price its shares between $14 and $16, and it   will sell 200 million shares with 30 million in reserve to raise   as much as $3.7 billion. The share price range represents a   market cap between $19.5 billion and $22.2 billion. That's short   of the $25 billion sources originally reported late last year,   and very close to the valuation at which Snap raised funds during   its series F round about nine months ago.How does Snap's IPO pricing compare to competing digital   advertisers, and should investors grab shares on March 2?makeArticleAd();Image source: SnapA look at valuationAt its IPO, Snap will be worth about $21 billion. That's a bit   more thanTwitter(NYSE:TWTR) , but considerably less than ad giantsFacebook(NASDAQ: FB) andAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) .CompanyValuationPrice-to-Sales RatioSnap$21 billion*51.9Twitter$11.7 billion4.6Facebook$386.5 billion14.1Google (C shares)$580.9 billion6.4Data source: Snap S-1/A and Yahoo! Finance *Based on the   midpoint of Snap's expected pricing range.Despite its relatively small valuation, investors will still   be paying a huge premium for Snap based on its sales. Last year,   the company brought in just $405 million in revenue. By   comparison, Twitter brought in more than six times as much ($2.5   billion). Snap and its underwriters think a dollar of its sales   is worth more than 10 times as much as Twitter's.Granted,Twitter is expected to see sales declinethis year, while analysts believe Snap could grow revenue around   150%. Still, Snap will trade at a huge premium to the still   rapidly growing Facebook and Alphabet, which are expected to grow   sales 37% and 18%, respectively.But the IPO pricing is still attractiveSnap's IPO pricing is still somewhat attractive however,   if but for one reason. It's nearly the same valuation as its last   round of funding. Snap's trailing 12 months of revenue for that   round was just $93.5 million. Snap will IPO at about one-quarter   the multiple of its last funding round.In that light, Snap's price looks much more reasonable. If   some of the smartest venture capitalists were willing to invest   when Snap's latest advertising products were still at their   earliest potential, it may well be worth it for investors now   that Snap has proven those products work. And if they can get it   at the same price, so much the better.You probably won't get Snap shares at $16Unfortunately, it's highly unlikely you'll be able to buy   shares of Snap at its IPO price on March 2. Since its planning to   price shares around the same price as its last round of funding,   Snap is potentially setting the stock up for a pop in the stock   price before it opens on the New York Stock Exchange.That's good for Snap. Even though Snap will only receive funds   at the price it sets on March 1, a first-day pop in the stock   price makes it look much more attractive. (Remember what happened   toFacebook stockafter its botched IPO?)Snap itself is only selling 145 million to 175 million shares   of the company's 1.2 billion shares outstanding, so it's not   leaving too much money on the table, either, by keeping its IPO   price low. The other 55 million shares will come from early   investors and company officials.If you're lucky enough to have a broker that's offering you a   chance to get in on the Snap IPO price, it may be worth   considering buying a stake in the company. Even at $16 per share,   however, it's still extremely risky. But don't be surprised if   Snap doesn't trade publicly for that price for a long time -- if   ever.10 stocks we like better than Snap Inc.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Warren Buffett Might Make These 3 Driverless Car Investing Mistakes;2/22/2017;"Warren Buffett is well-known for having, among the core tenets   of his investment strategy, a preference for companies with   serious ""competitive moats"" -- attributes that give them the   ability to sustainably keep ahead of their competition. But based   on his rues, Buffett would never invest in an emerging industry   like self-driving cars, and his competitive moat ideas don't   necessarily hold water in this world. If you're a fan of the   Oracle of Omaha, beware of following his investment philosophy   into these three mistakes.1. Focusing too much on sizeImage source: Alphabet (Waymo)makeArticleAd();Economies of scale are an important indicator for almost any   company. As the logic goes, the bigger a company is, the greater   its ability to cut per-unit costs.Ford's(NYSE: F) ability to keep its car costs lower thanTesla Motors'(NASDAQ: TSLA) , for example, isn't just based on the fact that   it produces more economically designed vehicles. It's also due to   the fact that Ford produced 1.5 million cars in the third quarter   of 2016, compared to the 24,800 cars Tesla Motors delivered   during the same period.But scalability in the driverless car industry doesn't   necessarily have anything to do with car sales. The automaker   with the best technology may ultimately come out ahead.   Technology is scalable at almost no cost. When Tesla Motors   wirelessly uploads its latest software to its already-sold   vehicles around the world, the company pays nearly nothing in   per-unit costs. The race to build the best driverless car at this   stage has much more to do with technology than with numbers of   vehicles sold, and the quantity of cars a company has sold thus   far isn't a indicator for which company is best placed to scale   in the future.2. Exaggerating the value of network effectsWhat network?Network effects are often touted as one of the strongest   competitive moats around.Facebook, an actual social network, perfectly defines the allure of the   network effect. If everyone is using a specific product or   platform, it can be extremely difficult for another company to   make inroads.At first glance, driverless cars seem to be an excellent   opportunity to build network effects. If one company's cars all   ""talk"" to each other as they navigate the roads, they'll get to   their destinations faster and more safely than competitors' --   right? Wrong. Driverless car technology must necessarily take   into account public safety, and unique, exclusionary networks fly   in the face of a universal platform for safe self-driving cars.   Automakers engaged in this space already know this; it's why   Ford, Tesla, and others are equipping their driverless cars with   the best real-world object detection technology available.When Ford announced earlier last week that it would invest $1   billion over five years in Argo AI, it wasn't because   the startup has thousands of self-driving cars on the road   -- it was because the company's robotics expertise ""gives Ford a   distinct competitive advantage at the intersection of the   automotive and technology industries,"" explained Ford Chief   Technology Officer Raj Nair in a press release. Likewise,Alphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) spinoff Waymo isn't relying on   Google's treasure troves of data to guide its vehicles as they   drive around. Instead, Waymo cars are equipped with sensors and   software designed to detect obstacles up to ""two football fields   away in all directions."" Ford, Alphabet, Tesla Motors, and others   aren't interested in network effects in this arena. They're   interested in their cars having the most acute local-area   awareness they can contain.3. Expecting government regulation to limit competitionRegular regulationRegulation can provide some of the widest competitive moats   around. If only one company is able to meet all the regulatory   requirements of being in a business, it's essentially illegal for   others to try to compete with it. The driverless car industry   recognizes this, and is making moves to ensure a level playing   field for all involved.Alphabet, Ford, Lyft, Uber, and Volvo Cars joined together   last April to create the ""Self-Driving Coalition for Safer Streets, "" a lobbying group whose stated mission is to ""work with   lawmakers, regulators, and the public to realize the safety and   societal benefits of self-driving vehicles."" These companies are   interested in standardizing national policy with simple and   low-cost barriers to entry for all interested automakers. So for   Buffett fans looking to back the company with the strongest   regulation-related advantages, know that some of the biggest   names in the business are working proactively to push   policies that ensure no company can ever build a regulatory   moat.Picking the right self-driving car stockWarren Buffett is an incredible investor, but he doesn't have   answers for every industry. There are many open questions around   self-driving cars, and some companies are morepoised to profitthan others. Rather than sticking to one-size-fits-all investment   mantras,equip yourself with the factsyou need to know, make informed investments, and set your   portfolio to auto-pilot for years to come.10 stocks we like better than Wal-MartWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock     tip, it can pay to listen.

Will Twitter's (TWTR) Fortunes Improve on the Trump Effect?;2/22/2017;"Since its debut,Twitter Inc. (TWTR)has been a social phenomenon but somehow hasn't been able to leverage that success to boost user growth.Twitter has vastly underperformed the ZacksInternet Softwareindustry so far in 2017. We note that shares have declined 10.22% as against the industry's gain of 20.37% during the period.Twitter's Dry RunThough the company has been working hard to bring about a turnaround, its efforts are yet to yield the desired results. Focus on Live video content, a flurry of live streaming deals, user friendly changes, measures to curb the trolling menace, divestment of non-core operations, and layoffs, the company has done it all. But all these are yet to move the needle for Twitter.Moreover, CEO Jack Dorsey has often been widely criticized for playing the dual responsibilities of heading both Twitter and Square, especially when both the companies are at crucial junctures. Dorsey was quoted by media reports saying ""My intention is to serve both companies in every way I know how and make sure that we are really focused on what's most important for each.""Last year, rumors about Twitter's probable sale did the rounds. Big names like AlphabetGOOGLand The Walt Disney Company were speculated to have shown interest in buying the micro blogging site. But t most bidders pulled out of the race. The news managed to drive share prices, albeit for a while, as the easing of the acquisition news led to a drop in the same.Twitter's Trump CardNotably, President Donald Trump used Twitter heavily for his presidential campaign in 2016. Given Trump's excessive usage, Twitter became all the more popular. Now that Trump is in office, he continues to use the same to broadcast his agendas.Trump's tweets have the power to influence markets and make headlines. Twitter reached an all-time intraday high of $25.25 on Oct 5, 2016 when the election campaigns were in full swing. Trump has been breaking stereotypes and making important announcements on Twitter instead of press conferences including his choice of Vice-President, Mike Pence, back in Jul 2016. This practice continues. In the first week of December, through his Twitter account, Trump asserted a 35% import tax. He even took to Twitter to express his dismay when retail giant, Nordstrom decided to drop the fashion line belonging to his daughter Ivanka Trump.An analyst observes that, ""The incessant news flow from the Trump administration playing out on Twitter and the ensuing global reaction pushes Twitter users to be increasingly engaged with the platform.""Despite Trump's penchant for Twitter, there has been no noticeable ""Trump effect"" for the micro blogging site yet. It reported an increase of just 2 million new users in the fourth quarter results that overlapped the presidential election results.Twitter, Inc. PriceTwitter, Inc. Price|Twitter, Inc. QuoteWhat Lies Ahead?Amid the exodus of the top level executives and poor quarterly results, Dorsey's move to buy shares worth $11 million can be seen as an effort to reassure dismayed investors.  Twitter investors have been on the edge given its unabated troubles. Generally it is said that when a founder buys shares of his own company, it implies that the stock has much upside potential.The company has been disappointing investors for a while now, missing revenue expectations and generating poor user growth.  At 319 million users, Twitter falls way behind other social media services like Facebook Inc.FB, which has over 1.8 billion users. Even Facebook's subsidiary, Instagram has over 600 million users.We have always maintained that Twitter's ability to attract advertising revenues amid significant competition from the likes of Facebook and Alphabet will be a key factor determining its growth, considering the fact that investment in product development needs to continue.Currently, Twitter has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Equifax (EFX) Expands Technology Center in Santiago, Chile;2/22/2017;"Equifax Inc.EFXis moving ahead with its plans to expand internationally. The financial information solutions company recently announced the expansion of its technology center in Chile. The recent expansion has been made at the company's largest global technology center, which is located in Santiago, Chile.The expanded office will accommodate over 50 engineers. The company anticipates filling the positions with new hiring. Equifax also revealed that the newly expanded office as well as the engineers will mainly focus on ""developing innovative analytical and big data solutions to produce insights"" for all 24 of the company's markets located across four continents.Chile: A Favored Destination for US Tech FirmsChile continues to be a popular destination for U.S.-based technology companies due to a number of reasons. The country has a similar time zone as New York City and has signed various free trade agreements including NAFTA.Moreover, the availability of cheap talented professionals as well as easy immigration policy attracts U.S. companies to open offices in the country. Additionally, the country is a favored destination due to its low corporate tax.Looking at the huge prospects in Chile, Equifax entered the market way back in 2009 by opening its largest technology center in Santiago. The facility is as important as Equifax's technology centers in Atlanta, GA and Dublin, Ireland which support all of its 24 markets in which it operates.Other U.S.-based technology giants who have their data centers in Chile are AlphabetGOOGLaka Google and IntelINTC. Moreover, Amazon'sAMZNAmazon Web Services is planning to open its first data center in the country.We believe that given the availability of a huge pool of talented IT professionals, ease of doing business and economic as well as political stability, the country is well poised to attract foreign companies to open their offices.Global Expansion Driving GrowthFor the last few years Equifax has been focusing on expanding its international footprint. Last year in September, the company opened a second office in Dublin, and employed more than 100 people at the new facility.Apart from this, the company has resorted to acquisitions and joint ventures to drive growth. In Feb 2016, the company acquired Australia-based data and analytic services provider Veda for cash consideration of approximately $1.7 billion (2.4 billion Australian dollars). Veda has been integrated into the newly created Asia Pacific reporting unit within the International segment.Notably, international revenues (including Europe, the Asia-Pacific, Canada and Latin America) surged 49% year over year to $212.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. On a constant-currency basis, revenues soared 62%. The Veda buyout boosted Asia-Pacific revenues from $2.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 to $70.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.Furthermore, Equifax remains enthusiastic about forming joint ventures that could expand its business internationally. Joint ventures keep operating costs down and need no integration time while diversifying the revenue source. To tap the immense growth opportunity in the Brazilian credit data market, Equifax merged credit reporting operations of its Brazilian subsidiary with Boa Vista Servicos S.A., the second-largest consumer credit bureau in Brazil.Equifax also owns roughly 50% in Russia-based credit reporting agency, Global Payments Credit Services LLC, and 49% interest in the Indian credit reporting agency, Equifax Credit Information Services Private Limited (a joint venture between Equifax and 6 Indian financial institutions). The company expects its investments in the joint ventures to yield desired results and help it to register solid growth over the long term.Bottom LineManagement's efforts, such as strategic initiatives for product innovation, expansion of data assets through acquisitions and continuous share gains in North America, should prove to be tailwinds. Also, the company's strong correlation with the consumer and financial markets and exposure in the U.S. and Europe are likely to propel growth, going ahead.The ongoing initiatives have helped the company to post splendid financial results for the last quarter. Equifax's top- and bottom-line results for fourth-quarter 2016 not only came ahead of our estimates but also marked solid year-over-year improvement.Investors have also reacted strongly to the company's overwhelming quarterly results posted on Feb 8. The stock has gained 6% since its last quarterly results, outperforming the Zacks categorizedFinancial Transaction Servicesindustry's gain of just 2.5% during the same time frame.Nonetheless, we expect the company's investments in new initiatives to weigh on its bottom-line results in the near term. Additionally, uncertainty surrounding IT spending and strengthening U.S. dollar are some concerns. Moreover, increasing competition from the likes of Fiserv and Total System Services are the other factors likely to affect earnings in the near term.Currently, Equifax has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

GM Keeps Gaining on Driverless Cars and Possible European Merger;2/21/2017;"Shares of General Motors CompanyGM, the largest American automaker, are up again after the brief President's Day market break. On the back of reports that GM is looking to sell its European operations, along with other positive future-looking moves, the automaker could be poised to keep climbing.GM is up 1.96% to $37.95 per share after early Tuesday afternoon trading.

Ride Red-Hot Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock for Free;2/21/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMD) is on a monster run of late. The long trade on AMD stock has been absurdly easy, especially when using options. I've even had success shorting the company recently, but only because I booked my profits quickly.makeArticleAd();Source:Matthew Rutledge via FlickrLast year conditioned me to not overstay my welcome in winning trades.After extended rallies, I am usually tempted to initiate short trades rather than long ones. Today, I will go against my instinct, though, and go long in AMD stock to capture a potential move (unthinkably) higher.Advanced Micro Devices' fundamentals haven't really changed in recent months. We're in a digital world and becoming even more reliant on tech. AMD is one of few who are the major suppliers to the brains of this tech world. This tells me that there is room for all - like rivalsIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) andNvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA) to prosper. So I don't want to short anything just for the sake of shorting.7 High-Risk, High-Reward Stocks to Buy NowClick to EnlargeFurthermore, I see things I like in AMD's stock chart. The price action has been constructive. I see higher lows challenging necklines that if broken upwards can invite even more buyers.I'm not usually one to chase a stock long on a 6%-plus day like what AMD stock is putting out on Tuesday. But the options market makes this fairly easy while leaving room for error.How to Trade AMD Stock NowThe bet:Sell AMD Oct $9 put for 60 cents per contract. By selling this put, I am committing to owning AMD shares at the strike sold. So I only do this if I am willing and able to own the stock at that price. I can even buy sacrifice Apr $9 puts for 4 cents to cover the crash scenario should it come.Usually I like to sell opposite risk to balance my trade, but in this case, I will refrain. In fact, I'll add an extra twist that could provide even more profit potential.Go Long the Super Spike in Tesla Inc (TSLA) StockThe Juice (optional): Buy the AMD Mar $14.5/$15.5 debit call spread for 28 cents to open. If I am correct and AMD stock rallies past my spread, I could gain up to 70 cents per contract. A more aggressive version of this would be to buy naked calls instead.I am not obliged to hold any of these trades through their expiration. I can close any of the for partial gains or losses at any time.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director ofSellSpreads.com.

Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Is the Perfect VALUE Play;2/21/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsI love growth stocks as much as the next guy, butAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL) might just be my favorite at the moment. That's because GOOGL stock has something that a lot of other high-growth dynamos simply don't have:makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');Source: ShutterstockAny value left whatsoever.I'm prudent when it comes to hyper-growth stocks such asAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) andNetflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX). I've missed out on some great runs as a result, but I also haven't gotten burned when growth flags. Instead, I prefer to focus on ""growth at a reasonable price,"" or GARP - and I believe GOOGL stock falls into this category.Go With GARPWith growth stocks, I look for a price-to-earnings ratio of a stock that is no more than 2x its earnings growth rate, if earnings are growing at 15% annually or more. And I want to back out stock buyback effects. To me, a GARP stock has a PEG ratio of 1.0, though I'll allow up to 1.5 depending on the earnings growth rate.GOOGL stock trades at 29x FY16 earnings and about 21x FY17 earnings. Analysts see five-year annualized growth at 19.2%. So on the surface, Alphabet seems to qualify as a GARP pick.The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for 2017: The Experts' PicksBut there's even more good news.This doesn't consider the net cash position of GOOGL stock. See, I value a company net of its net cash hoard, just as Peter Lynch used to do. With $86.4 billion on its balance sheet, that pulls the market cap for Alphabet down to about $480 billion.On $19.5 billion in net income for FY16, we suddenly find that Alphabet stock trades at 24.6 times FY16 earnings and only about 17.5 times FY17 earnings.That's the first step for me in even determining if GOOGL stock is a stock to get involved in.How Is Alphabet's Business?The next thing I examine is how healthy Alphabet Inc's actual businesses are.I still don't like the idea that GOOGL is basically a giant digital advertising billboard with a venture capital arm. However, I can't deny that Google's search engineholds an astonishing 80.47% market share. As long as four out of every five searches are conducted on Google, advertisers will throw money at Alphabet. There would have to be a scandal of monumental proportions, or some incredibly innovative new method of searching, to change this significantly.Alphabet's 17% year-over-year increase in advertising revenue to $22.4 billion comes as no surprise.So next I look at the YOY metrics, which look fantastic Aggregate paid clicks up 36%, paid clicks on Google properties up 43%, and paid clicks on Network properties up 7%. A lot of people freaked out that cost-per-click fell 15%, 16% and 19% for each of the above categories, respectively. The market doesn't seem to realize that this is because more advertising is being pushed to mobile.As for Other Bets, which is basically the company's VC arm, I don't love that it blew a billion dollars in the quarter. But considering free cash flow was $6.33 billion, and net cash is $86.4 billion, GOOGL has that money to spend. With portfolio strategy, all it takes is one of these VC bets to hit, and all that money spent will be made back and more.This brief glance tells me that Alphabet is an advertising business with dominant market share that is literally printing money. I mean, it generated $26 billion in free cash flow in FY16. That'sfreecash flow, meaning it can do whatever it wants with it.Go Long the Super Spike In Tesla Inc (TSLA) EarningsThat's even after spending about $10 billion in capex.Bottom Line on GOOGL StockNormally, I would continue to examine other parts of the business if I were looking to include GOOGLin something like my forthcoming stock advisory newsletter, The Liberty Portfolio.But for right now, I see enough to suggest investors continue their own due diligence and strongly consider GOOGL stock as a GARP play.Lawrence Meyers is the CEO of PDL Capital, and manager of the forthcomingLiberty Portfolio stock newsletter.

Can Amazon's Chime Challenge Microsoft's Skype and Cisco's Spark?;2/21/2017;"Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) recently introduced Chime, an  enterprise   collaboration service for online meetings, video conferencing,   voice calls, chat, and content sharing. Chime's apps work on iOS,   Android, Windows, and Mac, and the content is synchronized across   all platforms via Amazon Web Services (AWS).Chime comes in three versions -- Chime Basis, for 1:1 voice   and video calls and chat; Chime Plus, which adds screen sharing   and the integration of company directories; and Chime Pro, which   adds tools for scheduling, hosting, recording, and personalizing   meetings for up to 100 people.Image source: Amazon.makeArticleAd();These features indicate that Amazon is taking aim at   collaborative tools likeMicrosoft's(NASDAQ: MSFT) Skype andCisco's(NASDAQ: CSCO) Spark. But are those rivals already too deeply   entrenched in the enterprise market for Amazon to disrupt? Let's   take a closer look at Amazon's game plan to find out.Entering the crowded SaaS marketAmazon's AWS, which has an annual run rate of $14 billion, is   the  biggest cloud infrastructure platform in the world.   It's several times larger than its closest competitor,   Microsoft's Azure. But while AWS dominates the cloud platform   (infrastructure/platform as a service) market -- which hosts   storage space, processing power, and other tools for companies   and developers -- it doesn't have a major presence in the SaaS   (software as a service) market yet.The SaaS market is the crowded, consumer-facing side of the   cloud, which includes services like Microsoft's Office 365,   Dynamics CRM, and Skype. The lion's share of Microsoft's   commercialized cloud revenue run  rate of $14 billion is   generated by those SaaS products instead of Azure. Microsoft has   also been expanding Skype's capabilities as an enterprise   collaboration tool with  Microsoft Teams, which enhances   Skype's cloud-based communication features and tightly integrates   the service into Office 365.Microsoft Teams. Image source: Microsoft.Meanwhile, networking giant Cisco aggressively bundles   software and security products with its routers, switches, and   unified computing systems. Those bundles include collaboration   tools like Spark, the cloud-based platform for  messages,   meetings, and calls it launched in late 2015. Last quarter,   Cisco's collaboration revenues rose 4% annually to $1.06 billion   -- making it its third largest business after its  core   businesses of router and switches.But Microsoft and Cisco aren't the only players in the crowded   field of cloud-based collaborative tools.Alphabet's Google has been promoting Hangouts to enterprise customers   over  the past year,Boxhas added collaborative tools on top of its cloud storage   platform, andLogMeInacquiredCitrix's GoToMeeting video conferencing platform for the same purposes.   However, all these challengers notably lack Microsoft and Cisco's   clout in the enterprise market.That's why Amazon believes it can succeedBut like Microsoft and Cisco, Amazon also has leverage -- the   growing importance of AWS to enterprise customers. Amazon likely   believes that by offering Chime as an extension of AWS   (especially with its 30-day free trial) to its enterprise   customer base, it can gain a foothold in the crowded ""unified   communication"" platform market.Amazon previously launched enterprise SaaS products like    WorkSpaces, WorkDocs, and WorkMail, but it hasn't ever   released official growth figures for those products. However,   most industry watchers believe that those products are still   dwarfed by comparable solutions from Microsoft and Cisco. This   strongly indicates that AWS' dominance of the PaaS/IaaS markets   doesn't guarantee that Chime will become a Skype or Spark killer   anytime soon. Chime Pro also  costs more than Skype for   Business -- so it doesn't look like Amazon plans to undercut its   way into the market.The key takeawayChime sounds like a logical way for AWS to straddle the   PaaS/IaaS and SaaS markets, but it's easier said than done. The   market for cloud-based unified communication platforms is   incredibly crowded, and it's doubtful that a new service -- even   one bundled with AWS -- can claim a meaningful slice of the   market. However, Amazon investors should still keep an eye out   for future SaaS products to see if the company can eventually   challenge heavyweights like Microsoft and Cisco.10 stocks we like better than MicrosoftWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

These Are the 10-Most Admired Companies in the World;2/21/2017;"When the public votes for something the results can skew based   on perception, emotion, or sometimes even the desire to mess with   the outcome.That's how a $300 million state-of-the-art British polar   research ship earned the name ""Boaty McBoatface."" The question of   the ship's name was put to an internet vote, and while over 7,000   names were submitted, according toCNN, ""Boaty McBoatface"" won easily with 124,109 votes. Votes being   open to the public have given us many questionable,   past-their-prime Major League Baseball all-stars, as well as a   whale being tracked by Greenpeace being named Mr. Splashy   Pants.These are all ridiculous votes skewed by a playful public, but   they illustrate that sometimes open voting can produce less-than   reliable results. In creating its annualMost-Admired Companies ListFortune does not leave the question open to a public vote,   instead the publication works with its partner Korn Ferry Hay   Group to build a list and then survey executives from the   companies that make the initial cut.makeArticleAd();Image source: Getty.After starting with about 1,500 candidates (the 1,000 largest   U.S. companies ranked by revenue, along with non-U.S. companies   in Fortune's Global 500 database that have revenues of $10   billion or more), the selections are cut down to the   highest-revenue companies in each industry. That leaves 680   companies in 28 countries, and 3,800 insiders affiliated with   those companies voted on the list.""To determine the best-regarded companies in 51 industries,   Korn Ferry Hay Group asked executives, directors, and analysts to   rate enterprises in their own industry on nine criteria, from   investment value and quality of management and products to social   responsibility and ability to attract talent,"" Fortune explained.   This, as you can see, is not a fan vote, but an insider's   perspective on which companies are most admired by their own   executives, competitors, and people who should actually know.Apple topped the list of most-admired companies.

The 10 companies above are not             only successful, but those best-placed to judge are             saying they admire them, which should be taken as a             strong positive by shareholders and potential             investors.""Having the respect of your peers and your             competitors is absolutely crucial in business and             almost everywhere else,"" said Fortune's Assistant             Managing Editor Nicholas Varchaver in avideothat accompanied the list. ""Fortune's World's             Most-Admired Company's List is a list that embodies             precisely that idea.""This isn't a popularity contest or a thrown-off             quick vote. It's a fairly in-depth look at the             companies most-admired by business leaders. Making the             list suggests that these are brands that do things the             right way, companies with solid foundations likely to             not only be around for the long haul, but to continue             to thrive.Being held in this type of high regard by your             competitors may also come with actual advantages.             In-demand workers are likely to want to work for             companies they admire. The brands on this list likely             have an easier time recruiting top talent because they             are thought of this way and in competitive markets like             coders, top technology executives, and sales leaders,             that can be the difference between staying on top and             slipping to the back of the pack.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a               stock tip, it can pay to listen.

3 Virtual Reality Stock Investing Tips That Will Pay Off Long Term;2/21/2017;"Virtual reality (VR) is forecast to become a $162 billion   market by 2020, and the opportunities for investors to benefit   are growing. Nearly every major technology company is pursuing   VR, or at least looking into it, and some are spending billions   in order to make it the next popular computing platform.So how can individual investors benefit from all of this?   Start with these three tips:Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();Don't focus on hardwareYou're probably hearing a lot about VR headsets these days.   Oculus released its long-awaited Rift headset last year;Facebook(NASDAQ: FB) purchased the company more than two years ago for $2   billion.Sony's(NYSE: SNE) PlayStation VR headset launched back in October,   giving PS4 users the ability to play and view VR content on their   consoles. AndAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) recently launched its new mobile   VR headset, called the Daydream View. The company also just hired   a key VR headset designer away from HTC, which makes the popular   HTC Vive headset.But don't focus on any of that.VR headsets and other hardware are clearly an important part   of this market, but the real gains will come from software and   services. Tom Mainelli, vice president of devices and AR/VR at   IDC, said last year that ""... what people can do with   that hardware will depend upon the applications and services that   power it.""According to IDC, hardware sales will account for more than half of VR and   augmented reality (AR) revenues through 2020, but that it's   software and services that have the real long-term potential.""AR/VR software revenues will also get off to a quick start,   growing more than 200% year over year in 2016, but will quickly   be overtaken by services revenues in the middle years of the   forecast, as logistics and manufacturing demand enterprise-class   support,"" Mainelli said.The bigger, the betterIn the technology sector, it's often the players that start   out the biggest that win in the end, and virtual reality will   likely be the same.That's why it's important to look at what Facebook, Alphabet,   and Sony are doing in the space. Facebook's long-term goal isn't   to just sell high-end VR headsets, but rather to create the next   widely adopted computing platform.CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in aninterviewwithBusiness Insider last year that Facebook is ""mostly interested in the software""   aspect of VR, though he noted that the early stages of VR   development will require a focus on both hardware and   software.His long-term goal for AR and VR is to create an entirely new   computing platform. ""So I do think a new computing platform   always emerges every 10 or 15 years. VR is currently the most   promising candidate,"" he said.While Facebook is looking ahead to the next computing   platform, Alphabet is busy focusing on how it can gain from the   mobile VR market. The company recently debuted its Daydream   platform for Android users to find VR videos and apps.The importance of this VR hub can't be overstated. Smaller   companies may be making VR content, but Alphabet's Google has   built one of the only places where all of this content can live,   and be easily found. As mobile VR takes off, Daydream will   likely be the place where users go to get their content. Think of   it like a Google Play store for VR.And while Facebook and Alphabet are busy building out   platforms, don't forget Sony's potential to make itself a   powerhouse in the VR gaming market. The company already   working with more than 230 developers and publishers to create   160 PlayStation VR software titles.Sony's Game and Network Services is the company'ssecond-most profitablebusiness, and the company has said the VR ""offers great   future potential"" for the segment.Stay the courseHonestly, the payoff for VR investors will likely take some   time to materialize. That's because while the market is growing   fast, VR represents only a small portion of revenues -- if any --   for many of the companies involved in the space right now.Facebook said its investments in VR weren't material to the   company's 2016 financials, and Zuckerberg has stated several   times that VR probably won't truly take off for another five to   10 years.But that shouldn't be a deterrent for investors. Virtual   reality has the potential to transform how people access   information, view content, and interact with each other. If it   does become the next big computing platform, then taking a   long-term approach to the will be the wise course.Investors should heed this advice Zuckerberg gave last year:   ""We are betting that virtual reality is going to be an important   technology. I am pretty confident about this. And now is the time   to invest.""10 stocks we like better than FacebookWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Ignore the Management Shakeup Drama -- Viacom Is a Fantastic Buy Today;2/20/2017;"Long a pillar of the entertainment industry,Viacom(NASDAQ: VIAB) has fallen on hard times as of late. First, its   Paramount film division has suffered a string of box-office   flops, with its share of the box office falling to just 8% in   2016. Then there's its portfolio of television networks, once the   envy of the entertainment industry, but have suffered amid   increasing competition not only from peers likeWalt Disney, but from the internet itself. Viewers used to have to tune   into Viacom'sMTVto view the latest music video, or to itsComedy Centralnetwork for a laugh -- now consumers need only head over toAlphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOGL)YouTubefor the latest hit song and a laugh.However, for reasons that are detailed below, shares in the   entertainment conglomerate offer a compelling value to   prospective investors. Read on to learn more.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();Recent eventsThere's no other way to put it -- the last year or so has   tumultuous within the C-suite of Viacom's management. The drama,   which has been more than covered by the media, culminated with   theresignation of multibillionaire Viacom   Chairmanand former CEO Sumner Redstone. Now, with the appointment of new   CEO Robert Bakish, the situation appears to be on the mend, which   is great news, because all has not been well, not only in the   C-suite, but on the income statement as well:Metric20162015ChangeRevenue$3.32 billion$3.15 billion5%Operating income$706 million$839 million(16%)Diluted EPS$1.00$1.13(12%)Data source:Viacom February 9, 2017 Quarterly Earnings   Results.While revenues were obviously headed in the right direction,   profits were not -- which partially explains the company's low   earnings multiple. However, this has not always been the case. In   fact, lackluster growth could very well be considered an anomaly   in the company's operating history.A look backHistorically, Viacom has a history of profit growth and solid   returns on capital. In fact, its record over the years has been   quite good.VIAB Normalized Diluted EPS (TTM)data byYCharts.Alas, perhaps caused by or contributing to the myriad problems   at the top that the public has been more than privy to over the   past year, the company's momentum has been all but   derailed. Fortunately, there lies a strong case to be made   that the company's inherent advantages remain intact, and   brighter days lie ahead.Content is king!Viacom was built into what it is today by 93-year-old Sumner   Redstone, who built his empire on the belief that it was content,   not distribution, that would fuel the entertainment industry in   the decades ahead. When he made this shift, in the 1970s when he   was working for his father's National Amusements theater chain,   this was a novel innovation. Today, the world has caught onto   this insight and is giving the company a run for its money.   However, this should not detract from the company's prime   properties, networks like MTV (and its derivative channels), as   well as Nickelodeon, Comedy Central, Spike, BET, and CMT. On top   of all this, the company is also the owner of Paramount   Studios.Despite increasing competition from all quarters, Viacom's   networks are holding their own. For the quarter ended December   31, 2016, Media Networks' revenues rose 1% to $2.6 billion -- and   this ignores an averse 2% impact due to foreign exchange losses.   Softness in total advertising revenues (-2% to $1.29 billion) was   balanced out by an increase in affiliate (essentially   international) revenues, which climbed 2% to $1.14 billion. These   results are nothing to write home about, but they aren't   terrible, either. All the more, when looking at the situation   holistically and holding shares up to the light of its enviable   brands and good-not-great recent financial results, shares become   increasingly attractive when one reflects on their current   valuation.VIAB PE Ratio (TTM)data byYCharts.Should Viacom be able to right the ship, investors will more   than likely be handsomely rewarded given the stock's historically   low valuation. Here, the situation appears to be positive as   well. Management is no longer distracted by the drama surrounding   the departure of Sumner Redstone and will be able to focus on   international expansion of its brands. Also, Paramount Studios   has recently been given a ""booster shot"" of sorts via a$1 billion dollar, 3-year dealby Chinese film studios Shanghai Film Group and Huahua Media. The   cash infusion, coupled with the potential for allowing Paramount   to make strong inroads into the fast-growing Chinese film market   all bode well. These facts are perhaps why analysts polled byS&P Global Market Intelligencethink Viacom's EPS will likely grow from $3.85 per share in FY   2017 to a respectable $5.26 per share (an annualized 8%   annualized increase).A few words of cautionThe world continues to change, and while few could have   imagined Viacom's reach 30 years ago, the same could have been   said of potential threats to its core entertainment   brands. The fact is, the company faces threats from all   quarters, from individuals in their homes posting comedic videos   on YouTube to Time Warner'sHBO. Consumers only have so many hours in the day, and fantastic   content is now everywhere they turn. Viacom likely has what it   takes to continue to compete and garner viewers' eyeballs and   attention -- but the ever-present risk that the company will   slowly be overtaken is there.Foolish final thoughtsIt appears that now is a rare time to buy into a fantastic   media enterprise at a time when its shares are trading hands at a   historically low valuation. True, its competitive position isn't   what it used to be, and yes, the company has been mired in an   ugly battle for control that was only recently resolved. But   these negatives should not detract from the company's   one-of-a-kind media properties, nor its attractive valuation that   brings with it a 1.8% dividend yield to boot. Overall, Viacom's   shares are worthy of strong consideration by Foolish investors   with an eye to the future.Offer from The Motley Fool: The 10 best stocks to buy     nowMotley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more     than a decade beating the market.

5 Finalists for Google Lunar XPrize Race to the Moon;2/19/2017;"Only 46 weeks remain for one of five lucky companies to claim   a $20 million prize -- and the first one to arrive on the Moon   gets it.For the past 18 months, I've kept you up to date on the   loomingGoogle Lunar XPRIZE competition, a $40 million effort (recently increased from $30 million) --   sponsored byAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) and organized by Peter   Diamandis' nonprofit XPRIZE organization -- to encourage   private development of the Moon. But it's only now, this year,   that the clock really starts ticking. At some time within the   next 10 and a half months, one company must succeed in achieving   XPRIZE's three key stated requirements -- or forfeit its chance   to win the $20 million purse for placing first.Sometime in 2017, someone will land on the Moon. Bet on it.     Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();First thing's firstIn case youhaven'tbeen paying attention to the Google Lunar XPRIZE competition,   let's bring you up to date. So far, $5.25 million in prizes have   been doled out to teams demonstrating ""milestone"" capabilities in   the skills of conducting lunar landings, moving about on the   lunar surface, and lunar imaging.Still up for grabs is the grand prize -- $20 million for being   the first team to successfully land on the Moon, travel at least   500 meters from the landing site, and transmit two   high-definition ""Mooncasts"" back to Earth. The second team to   complete all three missions will receive $5 million, and then   there are up to $17 million in additional prizes for   accomplishing various add-on missions (e.g., conducting a   Mooncast from the Apollo 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, or 17 landing sites,   keeping a rover alive and functioning for at least two days, or   finding water on the Moon).But to win any share at all of this loot, someone has to land   on the Moon -- and someone has to be first.Round up some unusual suspectsWho will the winner be? I've already introduced you to two of   the leading contenders:Israeli start-up SpaceIL, which has contracted with     Spaceflight Industries for room aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket     to carry its spacecraft and lander to the Moon.And America's ownMoon Express, the first company to receive U.S. government approval to land     on the Moon (with a little help from Rocket Lab's Electron     rocket, which will be carrying it up there).Both these rivals have set launch dates vaguely in the ""late   2017"" range, ensuring this race will go down to the wire. As for   the other participants, last month, XPRIZE announced the   remaining three finalists ready to take a shot at the Moon. These   include:Synergy Moon, an international alliance among the Human     Synergy Project, California-based Interplanetary Ventures,     British satcom company RPC Telecommunications, and American     aerospace manufacturer Interorbital Systems. Interorbital will     provide the rocket for this team -- a NEPTUNE 8 launch vehicle     launching from sea, off the California coast, sometime later     this year.Team Indus, flying aboard an ISRO space agency     PSLV rocket from India before attempting to land an ""ECA""     moon rover.And finally, Japanese competitor Hakuto, an eclectic team     backed by everyone from Japanese space agency JAXA to Suzuki to     a rock band called ""Sakanaction.""Curiously, both Indus and Hakuto will ride the same PSLV   rocket to the Moon, and land their rovers on the same lander.   This could make it difficult deciding which one lands ""first"" and   gets the big $20 million prize. But seeing as they have to land   on the Moon successfully before they encounter this dilemma,   figuring out who arrived first will be a nice problem to have   once they get there. Indus and Hakuto plan to launch their XPRIZE   mission on Dec. 28, 2017.What it means to investors$20 million, $30 million, $40 million -- however much prize   money Google ultimately antes up for the winners, it's unlikely   thatanyof these teams will make much of a profit from running the first   privately funded Moon landing. But that's not the point.First and foremost, the point will be earning bragging rights   for accomplishing something no nongovernmental agency -- not even   SpaceX -- has ever done before: landing a spacecraft on the Moon.   And as we saw when privately held Scaled Composites won the   Ansari XPRIZE back in 2004 -- and was later bought out byNorthrop Grumman(NYSE: NOC) , which had previously owned only a minority stake --   just placing first in an XPRIZE competition could make a company   more attractive to would-be acquirers.Of greater import to investors, though, is what comesaftersomeone successfully lands a spacecraft on the Moon. Proving the   mission is feasible will almost certainly invite imitation by   larger companies, and with any luck, publicly traded companies   that we can invest in ourselves. It will open up not just a new   market, but literally a whole new world of opportunities for   those who follow the trail blazed by this year's space pioneers.   All we need now is for someone to take that first step.And by Dec. 31, 2017, we should know who that will be.10 stocks we like better than Northrop GrummanWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Are General Motors and Lyft About to Crush All Self-Driving Rivals?;2/19/2017;"General Motors(NYSE: GM) is planning to build and deploy thousands of   self-driving electric cars in test fleets with Lyft next year,   according to a newReutersreport.If that's for real, it will be by far the largest fleet of   autonomous test vehicles in operation. It's a very big deal that   has huge implications for GM, Lyft, and their   rivals.What the report saidAccording to the Reuters article, GM will build thousands of   Chevy Bolts equipped with prototype versions of the self-driving   system GM has developed with its subsidiary, Cruise Automation.   Most of these self-driving Bolts will go into ride-hailing   service with Lyft in several states starting sometime in   2018.makeArticleAd();GM has no plans right now to sell the self-driving Bolts to   the general public.CEO Mary Barra announced in December that GM would begin     producing self-driving Chevrolet Bolt test vehicles in early     2017. Image source: General Motors.What it would mean for GMGM has been working on self-driving technology for years. That   work seemed to take a big leap forward with the acquisition of   San Francisco-based start-up Cruise Automation early last year.   It appears that Cruise has since become the center of GM's   research efforts. Cruise's self-driving Chevy Bolt test cars have   become regular sights on San Francisco streets, and recent videos   taken from inside self-driving Bolt test cars suggest thatthe GM/Cruise technology is at a fairly advanced   level. GM announced in December that it would soon begin   producing self-driving Bolt test vehicles, but the hint was that   -- at least in the near term -- they'd be produced in   small quantities for GM's own testing.A mass deployment would demonstrate two things: First, that   GM's technology really is at a high level, and second, that GM   and its supplier partners are ready and able to mass-produce   self-driving cars.Both of those things are significant. Taken together, it would   be a strong argument that GM is leading the way to mass-produced   Level 4 self-driving vehicles. Companies likeAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) andTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) have attracted a lot of investor attention for   (among other things) their self-driving efforts, but --   as of right now, at least -- GM seems poised to leapfrog just   about everybody.What it would mean for LyftLyft, like its larger rival Uber Technologies, knows that   replacing its human drivers with self-driving vehicles is crucial   to its future. Autonomous ride-hailing vehicles will allow Lyft   to lower its prices while generating (hopefully) strong   profits.Uber has been working on its own self-driving technology for a   couple of years, and has a fewprototype self-driving test cars in servicenow. Lyft isn't known to have done any work on a self-driving   system of its own, but it doesn't need to: GMowns a 9% stakein Lyft, and GM seems to have it handled.If Lyft beats Uber to a self-driving fleet at scale, Uber will   have a big challenge on its hands.GM president Dan Ammann (center) with Lyft co-founders Logan     Green (left) and John Zimmer. GM owns 9% of the ride-hailing     company, and Ammann is a member of its board of directors.     Image source: General Motors.Could this be for real?The Reuters report, by veteran auto-business journalist Paul   Lienert, cites two unnamed ""sources familiar with the automaker's   plans."" Generally, investors (and everyone else) should take   reports based on information from unnamed sources with a grain or   two of salt. But a few things suggest to me that this is probably   for real.First, Lienert is a veteran with good sources, and Reuters   holds its reporting to high standards. Second, the report fits   with the known facts: GM and Lyft have both said that atest of autonomous GM vehicles in Lyft service is   forthcoming. Third, GM's Orion, Michigan, factory, where the Bolt is built,   has plenty of capacity to do a special production run in the   thousands.Finally, and most tellingly, neither Lyft nor GM denied the   report. In fact, GM's statement in response was almost a smiling   hint:We do not provide specific details on potential future     products or technology rollout plans. We have said that our AV     technology will appear in an on-demand ride sharing network     applicationsooner than you might think. [Emphasis added.]Translation: This is likely to happen, and it might begin   sooner than 2018.How important is this for GM investors?If it happens, it will be a big deal. While the idea of a   ""race"" to self-driving technologyisn't really useful to investors, a big test like this next year (or sooner) will show that GM   isn't about to be disrupted by Silicon Valley when it comes to   self-driving. It will also give lots of people an   opportunity to experience self-driving technology firsthand,   which will almost certainly speed its adoption by increasing   consumer demand.If nothing else, it seems very likely to attract investors'   attention and give GM shares a boost.10 stocks we like better than General MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Does Thinking About Your IRA Give You Heartburn? Let Us Help;2/17/2017;"An IRA is a fantastic retirement saving tool, but many   Americans don't take advantage of it, and when they do, they fail   to make the most of it. If you're among them, don't worry. Here   are some rules to help you build a bigger nest egg with an   IRA.What are IRAs?As a refresher, you can get big tax benefits by saving money   for retirement in a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA.In 2017, you can set aside up to $5,500 of your earnings in   either a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA or a combination of the   two. If you're 50 years old or older, then you can save up to   $6,500 of your earnings in an IRA.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Traditional IRAs can be funded with pre-tax money, which means   that money you put in now isn't taxed at your current tax rate.   Instead, that money, and any future gains, are taxed when its   withdrawn. Because of this feature, traditional IRAs can make   sense if you think your income tax rate in retirement will belowerthan it is today.Alternatively, Roth IRAs are funded with after-tax money,   which means you're paying taxes on your contributions now so that   you can withdraw them -- and future gains -- tax-free in   retirement. Because of up-front taxation, a Roth IRA can make   sense if you expect your income tax rate in retirement to behigherthan it is today.Some important IRA withdrawal rulesIn the case of a traditional IRA, if you don't wait until   you're at least 59.5 years old, the IRS will charge you income   taxes on any money that you withdraw, plus a 10% penalty, unless   you qualify for an early withdrawal exemption (more on that in a   minute).In the case of a Roth IRA, you can withdraw your contributions   tax-free at any age without a penalty, as long as the Roth IRA   has been established for at least five years. However, any gains   that you withdraw prior to reaching age 59.5 can be subject to   income tax and penalties.Both traditional IRAs and Roth IRAs do allow penalty free,   early withdrawals in specific instances. A full list of these   exemptions can be foundhere, but the big ones to know about include purchasing a first home   (up to $10,000), or payingcollege tuitionfor you, or an immediate relative, such as a spouse or child. The   rules for taking advantage of these exemptions can be quite   complex, so make sure you consult a tax professional before   taking any early withdrawals. After all, the last thing you want   is a surprise at tax time!Overall, a Roth IRA might be a better option if you think   you'll need to withdraw contributions five or more years from   now, and you won't be 59.5 years old or qualify for an early   withdrawal exemption at that time.Navigating the IRA income capsIn order to qualify for a tax deduction on a traditional IRA   contribution, your modified adjusted gross income has to be below   set limits if you, or your spouse, are covered by a retirement   plan at work. Similarly, in order to contribute to a Roth IRA,   your modified adjusted gross income needs to be below set limits   too.Recently, fellow Motley Fool Matthew Frankel did a great job   at explaining adjusted income limits for IRA'shere, but in short, if you're single and you are covered by a   retirement plan at work, you can take the full deduction on a   traditional IRA contribution if your adjusted income is below   $62,000 in 2017. You can qualify for a partial deduction if your   adjusted income is between $62,000 and $72,000.If you're single, you can make a contribution to a Roth IRA as   long as your adjusted income is less than $118,000. You can make   a partial contribution if your adjusted income is between   $118,000 and $133,000.If you're married filing jointly and covered by a retirement   plan at work, then you can take a tax deduction on your   traditional IRA contribution, as long as your adjusted income is   below $99,000. A partial deduction is possible if your adjusted   income is between $99,000 and $119,000.If you're not covered by a plan at work but your spouse is,   then you can make a tax deductible contribution to traditional   IRA if your adjusted income is below $186,000 or a partial   deduction if your adjusted income is between $186,000 and   $196,000.If you're married filing jointly, you can contribute to a Roth   IRA as long as your adjusted income is below $184,000. A partial   contribution can be made if your income is between $184,000 and   $194,000.If you think you're close to these limits and you're unsure of   how to calculate your modified adjusted gross income, you can   read up on the subjecthere.How to invest in an IRAOnce you've contributed to an IRA, you'll need to pick some   investments. There are a lot of choices, and you'll want to think   carefully about your age, your health, and the number of years   you have until you begin withdrawals.If you're young, in good health, and have plenty of years to   ride out the inevitable recession, then an IRA that includes   stocks, stock ETFs, and stock mutual funds can make sense.   Usually, buying and holding stocks and ETFs for long periods of   time is cheaper than buying an actively managed mutual fund, so   make sure that you balance the potential return, risk, and   expenses associated with these choices.Some investors may prefer owning individual stocks for the   long term, such as disruptive growth companies likeAmazonorAlphabet. Other investors may prefer owning an S&P 500 ETF that   tracks the stock market's returns more closely. If so, a low-cost   S&P 500 ETF that might fit the bill is theVanguardS&P 500 ETF(NYSEMKT: VOO) . It has an annual expense ratio of just   0.05%.It may also pay off to own dividend-paying stocks in an IRA.   Because IRAs offer tax advantages, dividend payments can compound   over time tax-deferred, or in the case of a Roth IRA, potentially   tax-free. Historically, dividend-paying stocks have outperformed   non-dividend-paying stocks. However, the performance ofdividend   stockstends to be lower during periods of rising interest rates, when   they have to compete with bonds for income investors'   attention.Overall, building a diversified IRA that includes exposure to   stocks and stock ETFs can provide financial security in   retirement. For example, if you're 30, and you contribute $5,500   per year for 35 years and earn a hypothetical 6% return per year,   then you'll have a nest egg valued at $612,886 at age 65. That's   not chump change, so make sure that you take advantage of this   powerful savings tool.The $16,122 Social Security bonus most retirees   completely overlookIf you're like most Americans, you're a few years (or more)   behind on your retirement savings. But a handful of little-known   ""Social Security secrets"" could help ensure a boost in your   retirement income. For example: one easy trick could pay you as   much as $16,122 more... each year!

VMware, Inc. (VMW) Keeps the Momentum Going;2/17/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsVMware, Inc.(NYSE:VMW) may not be one of the first companies that comes to mind when you're thinking about cloud services stocks. But, it should be.makeArticleAd();Source:FlickrBelieve it or not, VMW is one of the top enterprise cloud services and virtualization companies out there. And, its growth up to now, while impressive, is just the beginning. In the past 12 months, VMW stock has almost doubled.That sounds compelling, but the underlying story is what makes VMW's rise something you should understand, especially if you're looking for exposure in this massively disruptive market.Simply put, cloud computing means that your computer doesn't need to have individual software packages for each specific job you want it to do. In the old days, you ran a word processing program, a spreadsheet program, a design program, etc. And, every machine had to have its individual software suite.The rise of networked computers meant that all of this software could be stored on a network ""library"" and each user could access what they needed.7 Tech Stocks That Could Implode at Any MinuteThe next iteration of these networks were housed in the ""cloud,"" which simply implies a virtual space built into servers. One of the primary advantages is the ability to access your information from the cloud, regardless of where you are or what computer you're using.Cloud computing has been around for a long time, and companies such asAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL),Microsoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT),Oracle Corporation(NYSE:ORCL) andAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) have been using the cloud for many years.Now, companies of all sizes are migrating to the cloud, and within the cloud universe there both public clouds (where many people have access) and private clouds (where only select people have access). VMW provides the ability to develop each of these systems, and also facilitates unique access between public and private clouds.Why Don't We Hear Much About VMware?VMWare is actually owned byDell Technologies Inc(NYSE:DVMT) subsidiary,EMC Corporation(NYSE:EMC). Last April, Dell bought EMC to become the largest privately-held tech company in the world. So, VMWare is a cloud-based, publicly-traded branch of this major tech player now.Part of the reason you don't hear about VMWare as much as its competitors is because the company's relationship to its owners is a bit convoluted, and analysts aren't very confident in figuring out how to value VMW stock. Their loss is your gain.3 Stocks to Buy for Under $10 With 25%-Plus UpsideQ4 and full-year numbers were posted in late January, and they show how strong VMW stock remains. Earnings beat analyst expectations and revenue continued to grow at a solid clip. A new strategic partnership with AMZN's cloud-computing juggernaut, Amazon Web Services (AWS), adds some serious firepower to the VMW arsenal. It also helps the company remain competitive in a very dynamic field.When you have a tech parent like EMC and a tech partner like AWS, you are doing very well. These brands are major players in the enterprise sector and will open even more doors for VMW in the future.

Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Stock: The Pause That Refreshes;2/17/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsNvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA) is all about visual computing.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockThe company started as a high-end graphics card maker for users who were interested in having the best display quality you could get. That ranged from online gamers to research scientists.Given that chip and card makers aren't exactly in short supply, few investors gave this niche player much time. The thought was, NVDA may have a great graphics card, but it's a ""nice to have,"" not a ""need to have"" kind of product.What's more, most chipmakers had perfectly serviceable graphics cards. Why contract out to yet another vendor when you already had a chipmaker that could provide you with a decent graphics card?Those Days Are Gone NowQuality graphics are no longer just a nice add on; they're crucial now that processing speeds have soared and new technologies have been able to thrive. In this visual computing space, Big Data, virtual reality (VR) and the Internet of Things (IoT) are three major disruptive forces that lean heavily on quality rendering and fast processing.7 Tech Stocks That Could Implode at Any MinuteSimply put, Big Data packages large data sets and then analyzes them to find any discernible patterns or trends. For example, a store can figure out what day and time is best for 30-something women to buy a shirt. Visualizing these data sets is very helpful in analyzing this process.VR and its cousin, augmented reality (AR), are not only the hottest technologies in gaming, but are already revolutionizing other fields where interaction is highly prized. For example, medical schools are using AR tech to virtually operate on an augmented cadaver, rather than physically operating on one. The possibilities are just being tapped at this point.IoT is another technology in its infancy. As artificial intelligence and bandwidth merge, opportunities are appearing everywhere, for instance in ""smart"" cars, homes, offices, you name it. One of the best examples nowadays isAmazon.com, Inc's(NASDAQ:AMZN) Alexa orAlphabet Inc's(NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Home device, where you can do everything from order a pizza to set your thermostat just by talking to the thing. It recognizes your commands and then, through its connectivity, turns your request into reality.NVDA is already working with many major car companies to create the next-generation car dashboard, as well as other interactive possibilities. It is helping scientists manipulate molecules and atoms to build better drugs. And, it's building the chips that are featured in the newest gaming system fromNintendo Co., Ltd (ADR)(OTCMKTS:NTDOY).These are just a few reasons that NVDA is up 282% in the past 12 months.7 Dividend Stocks for the Retirement You DeservePart of this big move was because the entire semiconductor industry was weak because demand had slackened. But, this is a cyclical industry and it's ""game on"" once again. Plus, NVDA has shown that it's more than just a graphics card maker at this point. It is on the leading edge of the next generation of visual computing.NVDA numbers for Q4 were recently released, and the stock came down from its 52-week highs on the news.But, this is simply the pause that refreshes. The numbers were still impressive and there is significant untapped growth for NVDA stock.

Apple to Begin Assembling iPhone SE in India from April;2/17/2017;"makeZacksArticleAd();Reportedly,Apple Inc.AAPLin collaboration with its manufacturer, Wistron Inc. will begin to assemble iPhone SE in India starting this April. The plant will be located in the state of Karnataka in south India.Though there is no official word on the matter from Apple or Wistron, it has been reported that initially the Cupertino giant wants to assemble 0.3-0.4 million units of iPhone SE. Apple hasn't even waited for the numerous tax concessions that it sought from the India government including the 15-year customs duty holiday.Analysts observe that it was prudent on part of Apple to begin assembling its most economic iPhone offering, SE, which was launched to cater to cost sensitive markets like India. Plus, it also will support future iOS upgrades unlike iPhone 5S, which will soon be discontinued in most of the markets including India.Apple Inc. PriceApple Inc. Price|Apple Inc. QuoteWhy is Apple Keen on India?Since the last year, Apple has been increasing its focus on India to claim a greater share of the vast smartphone market, of which it reportedly holds only 2% as of now. Apple faces slowing iPhone demand in most of the regions, either because of competition or regulatory hurdles (China) or market saturation (the U.S). Therefore, it makes sense for the company to solidify its position in India, which is projected to become the second largest smartphone market in the world. In fiscal 2016, Apple sales in India grew approximately 50% over the prior fiscal.Furthermore, a younger (and skilled) population and increasing investment in broadband network by the government also make India an attractive growth opportunity for Apple over the long run. In fact, the government under PM Narendra Modi is eager to bring foreign capital and boost manufacturing facilities in India.The recently outlined FDI policy also bodes well for the company as it eliminates the requirement to locally source products for at least a three-year period. This will enable Apple to open its solely-owned retails stores in India. Thereafter, the company will have to comply with the rule. The company has also partnered with telecom company Reliance, which is providing its Jio (a unique all-IP network) service for free with the new iPhones.Last year, Tim Cook was on a charm offensive in India. Besides meeting Modi, he also announced the opening of an iOS App Design and Development Accelerator in Bengaluru and a map development office in another southern Indian city, Hyderabad in collaboration with regional firm RMSI.ChallengesThe market is highly cost sensitive. Reportedly, majority of the smartphones sold are priced around INR 10K (roughly $145). iPhone 7 on the other hand costs almost five times more. Even iPhone SE is priced at INR 30K. The lion's share of Apple's revenues in the country comes from devices, which are a couple of generations old. Newer models have relatively low demand given the hefty price tag.  A few days back, it was reported that the Apple team in India is trying to increase revenues to $3 billion by 2017-18 and by local assembling operations, the company can start to operate its own retail outlets and avail a 10% tax benefit. This should lower prices.Plus, Apple's rival Samsung along with a few Chinese smartphone makers dominates this market. Samsung has long been in the market and with reportedly 23% share, it is a leading player in the country. Apple is quite late to the party.Also, Apple's lack of focus on regional customers' demand is a concern. India is categorized by handsets that work on dual SIMs. Apparently, Apple is not keen on making dual SIM handsets. This could be a very big impediment to growth in the country.Also, analysts observe that Apple is ""relocating"" manufacturing to India from China, given rising labor costs. However another analyst argues that though labor is cheap compared with China, productivity is relatively better in China. Simple assembling may not drastically bring down prices. However, the creation of a local supply chain as in China will be a big positive.Despite the pros and cons, Apple is expected to continue its India drive. It will be taking up a lot more initiatives this year. However, whether those initiatives yield desirable results remains a watch and see story.Apple, of course, is not the only tech player eyeing India for growth. Given the potential of this market, Silicon Valley's interest is well understood. From Microsoft Corp.MSFTto AlphabetGOOGLto Facebook Inc.FBall remain laser focused on the market.Zacks Rank & Price MovementAt present, Apple has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Heading to $160 on Video Capabilities;2/17/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMaking excuses to not likeFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) and avoiding FB stock is just plain dumb. Ahead of the company's fourth-quarter earnings report, I gave FB stock a Strong Buy rating with a 12-monthprice target of $150. With the earnings report now in behind us, I'm inclined to raise that target to $160.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockIndeed, FB stock is no bargain when shares are near all-time highs, but the company's revenue growth engines are certain to significantly impact the bottom line. Although management didn't scale back on plans to increase capital spending, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who said the social media giant was aiming for shorter-form content, has made clear that FB intends to dominate video, which is where the bulk of its capex will go.And, that spending has already begun.Why Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock Could Fly to $1,000 in 2017Last week Facebook hired Mina Lefevre, former head of scripted development atViacom, Inc.(NASDAQ:VIA). This hire can only be for one reason: to increase Facebook's transition toward developing original content. Contrary to popular opinion, Zuckerberg is not pushing Facebook to become a television network, nor does he envision the company competing withNetflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX). His drive to become a ""video-first"" company has everything to do with selling more ads.From my vantage point, the reason Facebook must spend money is because it has begun to experience a problem thatTwitter Inc(NYSE:TWTR) craves: It has run out of ad space on its news feeds. But, Facebook doesn't want to sacrifice the user experience without first knowing what sorts of videos users will want to see - and how to make them less intrusive.To that end, Lefevre, whose track record at Viacom-owned MTV Networks includes producing teen-focused content, is a solid hire. To the extent Facebook's shorter-form content can put it into the realm ofAlphabet Inc's(NASDAQ:GOOGL) advertising juggernaut YouTube, it would have been money well spent.7 Stocks to Sell or Short Before the Bears StrikeIn that regard, given Zuckerberg's Midas-like qualities, it would be a mistake to avoid FB stock solely on the fears of high capex. It would make more sense to focus on the return Facebook can realize from its investments.Bottom Line for FB StockFacebook - as it promised in the third quarter - has signaled that it will be in a period of transition. Investors, however, are now taking their time to see how the increased spending balances out with management's warning of slow ad growth. While this might put FB stock in limbo, now is also the time to look at the big picture. And my crystal ball says to own FB stock, don't trade it, and wait for $160.As of this writing, Richard Saintvilus did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace7 Dividend Stocks for the Retirement You DeserveWhy Amazon.com, Inc.

Fidelity Investments' Revenue And Profit Rose In 2016;2/16/2017;"Known for managing millions of retirement accounts, college savings plans and regular taxable-investment accounts, Fidelity Investments on Thursday said 2016 revenue rose 3.4% to $15.9 billion, a record for the privately held company.The combination of revenue growth and slightly lower expenses produced a record profit of $3.5 billion. That was an increase of 19.5% over 2015's $3 billion in operating income.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');""All businesses contributed to our strong results,"" a Fidelity spokesman said.The 2016 profit increase reversed a profit decline in 2015, when profit fell $325 million, or 9.8%, from 2014's $3.282 billion.""Fidelity is profitable, strong, innovative and driven to growth,"" said Jim Lowell, editor-in-chief of Fidelity Investor, an independent newsletter. ""That's not true for many financial services companies.""The 2015 profit erosion was caused by spending on staffing and technology to compete with tough rivals.Operating expenses fell slightly to $12.35 billion in 2016 from $12.4 billion the year before.""The slowdown in expenses is because Fidelity is starting to see the benefit in Abigail's (Johnson) leadership,"" Lowell said. One way she has cut spending is by centralizing functions, eliminating redundancies in information technology and compliance. ""There's more efficiency,"" Lowell said.Across all of its stock mutual funds, technology was Fidelity's largest sector as of Jan. 31 with a 20.3%, according to Morningstar Inc.Fidelity's top U.S. holdings wereApple(AAPL),Facebook(FB),Amazon(AMZN),Alphabet(GOOGL) andMicrosoft(MSFT).Apple's stock has surged 22% since shortly after the election. It has a so-so 76 Composite Rating from IBD. Facebook has a 90 Comp Rating and is trading near its all-time high after breaking out of a cup-with-handle base in late January. Amazon has risen 12% this year, has a 76 Comp Rating, and has formed a cup-with-handle base with a buy point of 843.94. Alphabet's Comp Rating is 69. Microsoft has a weak 60 Comp Rating. It has uptrended since June.99 is the highest possible Comp Rating, which is on a scale from 1-99.Fidelity also reported a record $5.7 trillion in investor assets under administration (AUA), up 10.6% from year-end 2015.Total discretionary and nondiscretionary asset flow for the year was $218.9 billion, up 15% from 2015 flow.Discretionary flow includes flow to and from managed accounts, mutual funds, exchange traded funds and collective investment trusts.Nondiscretionary flow goes to and from investments not managed by Fidelity, such as other firms' mutual funds and individual securities.At year-end, Fidelity serviced 27.5 million members of workplace retirement plans. It serviced another 8.9 million retail households, plus 8.7 million institutional accounts.Those totals were 6%, 6.8% and 4.1% higher, respectively, than at year-end 2015.Fidelity mutual fund managers found it harder to beat their peers in 2016. Fidelity mutual funds beat 58%, 68% and 70% of their peers for the trailing one-, three- and five-year periods that ended Dec. 31. They outperformed 72% of their peers in the one- and three-year periods and 71% of their peers in the five-year span.Still, the outperformance rate was high. ""To beat 58% of your peers and have that as a bad year - most fund companies would kill for that number,"" said newsletter editor Lowell. ""The falloff reflects the difficult time active managers had during the six-week Trump (inspired) market run-up. Odds are they'll be back to outperforming 70% or more in 2017. That is excellent.""The annual report is a must-read mainly for Fidelity employees, who control 51% of the voting stock, while the Johnson family controls the other 49%.Abigail Johnson is chairwoman of parent company FMR. She succeeded her father, ""Ned"" Edward C. Johnson III, late last year, shortly before her 55th birthday. Ned Johnson had been chairman since 1977.Fidelity was founded by Abigail's grandfather, Edward C. Johnson II, in 1946. His father, Samuel Johnson, worked in the family dry goods business at the C.F. Hovey department store.Abigail's brother, 52-year-old Edward C. Johnson IV, is president of Fidelity's Pembroke Real Estate division.Going forward, a key challenge for Fidelity is persuading customers - especially mutual fund investors - of the value of active management. ""Broad indices are holding fair or fully valued stocks (after the long market run-up),"" Lowell said. ""Active managers can look at which stocks have the best cash flow, best defensive characteristics, best growth opportunities, rather than buying bundles of high-priced stocks passively.""Behind The 2016 ImprovementFormally, the annual report is for Fidelity Financial Services, which consists of Fidelity Investments and the other financial services lines of parent company FMR. It excludes FMR's nonfinancial businesses such as its hotel and real estate operations.Fidelity has lagged rival Vanguard in attracting net new money from shareholders.In 2016, Fidelity saw the second-largest net outflow from mutual funds, as shareholders hit the firm with $24.5 billion in net redemptions, according to Morningstar Inc. That left Fidelity with $1.2 trillion in mutual fund total net assets. That asset count reflects open-end mutual funds and excludes money market funds and funds of funds.Fidelity's mutual fund outflow was exceeded only by Franklin Templeton Investments' $43.2 billion in net outflow. Franklin Templeton had $378.7 billion in total net assets.Net inflow to passively run Fidelity funds - mainly exchange traded funds - reduced its combined mutual-fund-and-ETF net outflow by about $1 billion.Whether it was flow just to mutual funds or to funds plus ETFs, shareholders largely had low costs on their minds. That made index mutual funds and ETFs popular destinations for net inflow. ""By far, 2016 belonged to Vanguard,"" Morningstar editor Tom Lauricella and senior analyst Alina Lamy noted in a recent report. ""The low-cost juggernaut dominated the flows landscape to a remarkable degree.""Vanguard drew net inflow to its mutual funds that vastly outpaced its rival firms'. Vanguard lured in a net $182.997 billion to its mutual funds.All other mutual fund complexes with inflow - there were 314 if them - had combined net inflow of $151 billion.Vanguard also attracted $94.26 billion in net inflow to its ETFs.Still, Fidelity had bright spots. Investors poured $37.2 billion in net inflow into passively run Fidelity mutual funds and ETFs. The trouble was that investors yanked a net $60.5 billion from Fidelity's actively run funds and ETFs.And three Fidelity portfolios were among the 12 top stock mutual funds of 2016 in terms of gathering net inflow. Now-$111.4 billion Fidelity 500 Index Fund (FUSEX) pulled in a net $7.3 billion, fourth best. Sixth best was now-$5 billion Fidelity SAI U.S. Large Cap Index (FLCPX), which drew in a net $4.4 billion. And 11th best was now-$4.3 billion Fidelity SAI U.S. Quality Index (FUQIX), which attracted a net $3.2 billion.Money Market FundsIn addition, a trio of Fidelity money market funds had massive net inflow, which are not reflected in the Morningstar flow data for long-term funds.Fidelity Institutional Government (FIGXX) pulled in $74.8 billion in net inflow. Fidelity Government Money Market Fund (SPAXX) drew a net $37.7 billion. And Fidelity Government Cash Reserves (FDRXX) pulled in a net $21.3 billion.Industrywide, money market fund inflowwas driven by investor uncertainty. Investors are unsure how markets will respond to President Trump's policies, actions by the new Congress, the strong dollar, expected additional interest-rate hikes by the Federal Reserve and global political events, Tom Roseen, head of research services for Lipper, told IBD.Another reason for volatile flow into and in some cases out from money market funds is the new Securities and Exchange Commission rule requiring certain money market funds to impose redemption fees and limits to discourage shareholder exits in time of market stress, Roseen says.The funds with net inflow hold government-issued debt. Referred to as government money market funds, funds in that group are generally exempt from the gates-and-fees requirement. In turn, that makes them popular with investors who do not want their ability to exit the fund to be limited or subject to penalty fees.RELATED:Are Fidelity's Recent Stock Buys And Sells Retirement Account Hot Sauce?Vanguard Net Fund Inflow Dwarfed Its Peers' In 2016Vanguard Drew The Lion's Share Of 2016's Mutual Fund Net Inflow"

It excludes FMR's   nonfinancial businesses such as its hotel and real estate   operations.Fidelity has lagged rival Vanguard in attracting net new money   from shareholders.In 2016, Fidelity saw the second-largest net outflow from   mutual funds, as shareholders hit the firm with $24.5 billion in   net redemptions, according to Morningstar Inc. That left Fidelity   with $1.2 trillion in mutual fund total net assets. That asset   count reflects open-end mutual funds and excludes money market   funds and funds of funds.Fidelity's mutual fund outflow was exceeded only by Franklin   Templeton Investments' $43.2 billion in net outflow. Franklin   Templeton had $378.7 billion in total net assets.Net inflow to passively run Fidelity funds - mainly exchange   traded funds - reduced its combined mutual-fund-and-ETF net   outflow by about $1 billion.Whether it was flow just to mutual funds or to funds plus   ETFs, shareholders largely had low costs on their minds. That   made index mutual funds and ETFs popular destinations for net   inflow. ""By far, 2016 belonged to Vanguard,"" Morningstar editor   Tom Lauricella and senior analyst Alina Lamy noted in a recent   report. ""The low-cost juggernaut dominated the flows landscape to   a remarkable degree.""Vanguard drew net inflow to its mutual funds that vastly   outpaced its rival firms'. Vanguard lured in a net $182.997   billion to its mutual funds.All other mutual fund complexes with inflow - there were 314   if them - had combined net inflow of $151 billion.Vanguard also attracted $94.26 billion in net inflow to its   ETFs.Still, Fidelity had bright spots. Investors poured $37.2   billion in net inflow into passively run Fidelity mutual funds   and ETFs. The trouble was that investors yanked a net $60.5   billion from Fidelity's actively run funds and ETFs.And three Fidelity portfolios were among the 12 top stock   mutual funds of 2016 in terms of gathering net inflow. Now-$111.4   billion Fidelity 500 Index Fund (FUSEX) pulled in a net $7.3   billion, fourth best. Sixth best was now-$5 billion Fidelity SAI   U.S. Large Cap Index (FLCPX), which drew in a net $4.4 billion.   And 11th best was now-$4.3 billion Fidelity SAI U.S. Quality   Index (FUQIX), which attracted a net $3.2 billion.Money Market FundsIn addition, a trio of Fidelity money market funds had massive   net inflow, which are not reflected in the Morningstar flow data   for long-term funds.Fidelity Institutional Government (FIGXX) pulled in $74.8   billion in net inflow. Fidelity Government Money Market Fund   (SPAXX) drew a net $37.7 billion. And Fidelity Government Cash   Reserves (FDRXX) pulled in a net $21.3 billion.Industrywide, money market fund inflowwas driven by investor uncertainty. Investors are unsure how markets will respond to President   Trump's policies, actions by the new Congress, the strong dollar,   expected additional interest-rate hikes by the Federal Reserve   and global political events, Tom Roseen, head of research   services for Lipper, told IBD.Another reason for volatile flow into and in some cases out   from money market funds is the new Securities and Exchange   Commission rule requiring certain money market funds to impose   redemption fees and limits to discourage shareholder exits in   time of market stress, Roseen says.The funds with net inflow hold government-issued debt.   Referred to as government money market funds, funds in that group   are generally exempt from the gates-and-fees requirement. In   turn, that makes them popular with investors who do not want   their ability to exit the fund to be limited or subject to   penalty fees.RELATED:Are Fidelity's Recent Stock Buys And Sells     Retirement Account Hot Sauce?Vanguard Net Fund Inflow Dwarfed Its Peers' In     2016Vanguard Drew The Lion's Share Of 2016's Mutual     Fund Net Inflow"

Facebook Inc (FB) Is Losing the War Against Fake News;2/16/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) has begun fighting a war against fake news and, so far at least, it's losing. Failure could have profound implications for Facebook's bottom line, and even threaten its ability to remain in business.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');Source: ShutterstockThe threat is deeper than Donald Trump. The power of Facebook's software tools, and communication capabilities, is a two-way street that benefits the darker side of human nature, as well as its better angels.For example, Facebook's Graph Search tool, introduced in 2013, can help you search the site efficiently. It can also help youstalk someone.Facebook Live, which lets users stream live video on the site from their camera phones, can let you show grandparents your kid's birthday party, as it happens. It can also let youshow the child being killed.CEO Mark Zuckerberg promised to do something about this in November, on his own Facebook page, but has not come out with much useful beyond tags on disputed items and a vague statement from an underling thatsharing fake news is your prerogative.FB stock holders need to be worried.Facebook Is a Media Company, Like It or NotFacebook has continually denied it is a media company, subject to responsibility for what it posts, fearing the need in that case for human interventionthat simply would not scale.7 Stocks Warren Buffett Is Buying or SellingThe latest statement from its vice president for partnerships, Dan Rose, is that Facebook is""a new type of platform …where people discovery a lot of media content.""That's about as mealy-mouthed as anything that could come from a corrupt politician.For FB, however, fake news is a global problem, and most countries don't have regulations separating a ""telecommunications service"" from the responsibilities of a ""media outlet."" Thus, Facebook's efforts at self-censorship are showing up first in international markets.The European Commission, for instance, has already warned Facebook, and other networks, thatthey face legal actionif the issue of fake news is not dealt with. AlongsideAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL), Facebook is testing a system calledCrossCheckfor flagging fake news in France, which holds a presidential election this spring.This is being done in cooperation with local media, but the reporting on it shows the difficulty.A Russian storyon the system calls the problem ""so-called fake news"" and calls CrossCheck a plot by the ""mainstream media.""Germany, which holds its own elections this September, is also threatening to imposea 500,000-euro finefor each fake news story it runs.How Bad Can It Get?To see how bad things can get with fake news and the abuse of Facebook Live, Zuckerberg might look at South Sudan, where expatriates are turning a civil conflict into genocide with social media messages or the Dominican Republic, where two journalists were recently killed on Facebook Live as a message from crime gangs.Apple Inc. (AAPL) Careens Closer to Major AR AnnouncementA recent Pew Research study showed 44% of Americans get their news through Facebook, and that most users get news from only one site, meaning Facebook has political and media power commensurate with its financial power.That power: fourth-quarter revenue of $8.8 billion, with $4.27 billion going to net income. FB stock has no debt but nearly $30 billion in cash on the books, supporting a market cap of $385 billion - almost twice that ofWal-Mart Stores Inc.(NYSE:WMT).All this is severely threatened if Facebook can't get its arms around the problem of lies and abuse.Real lives are on the line, not just cyber lives.

Would You Ditch Your Home Phone for Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN)?;2/16/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsRoughly half of American homes no longer have an old-school telephone, relying instead on cell phones and smartphones. IfAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) andAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL) have their way, home phones could become even more of a rarity.makeArticleAd();Source: AmazonA report inTheWall Street Journalsuggests the companies are working on adding voice-calling capabilities to the Amazon Echo and Google Home smart speakers.The Plan to Make Amazon Echo Your New TelephoneTheWall Street Journalis reporting that Google and Amazon are looking at an all-new use for their smart speakers:replacing the home telephone.The idea makes sense. Telephones increasingly seem like outdated technology. Between smartphones and PC-based calling services likeMicrosoft Corporation's(NASDAQ:MSFT) Skype, the days of the dedicated home phone seem numbered. In 2015, a survey by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (which, apparently, cares about these things) found thatnearly half of American homes had given up their dedicated landline.But, that still leaves a lot of telephones in operation.Apparently, it's occurred to both Amazon and Google that smart speakers such as the Amazon Echo and Google Home may be the right device in the right place at the right time. Smart speakers get the name because they leverage an AI-powered personal digital assistant.Why Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock Could Fly to $1,000 in 2017Amazon's Echo is home to Alexa, withover 5,000 skills. These devices have the smarts to take on telephone functionality. They could incorporate Skype, for example. And, Google has a slew of its own telephony applications it could leverage, including Google Voice and Duo.The Amazon Echo and Google Home are equipped with excellent microphones, they have speakers, they are always connected (to the internet) and they respond instantly to voice commands, even from across a room.So, as long as privacy isn't an issue (since using one would be like using a speakerphone), a smart speaker could replace a telephoneandsave consumers money by eliminating the monthly cost of a landline. While this would be a potentially useful trick for existing smart speaker owners, it's the kind of practical capability that could drive sales among those consumers who wouldn't otherwise consider a high-tech device like the Amazon Echo.The Challenges of Turning a Smart Speaker Into a TelephoneWhile the technology and built-in smarts may be there, in reality turning that Amazon Echo on your kitchen counter into your home phone may not be quite that simple.TheWall Street Journalarticle lays out some of the challenges. For example, there are potential privacy issues, not only in speaking out loud to the Echo (it lacks an AUX input, so you couldn't physically connect a handset), but the fact that now your telephone would always be listening to you and recording key data like phone numbers and call durations.Amazon and Google would also have to implement a feature to prevent voice commands from being triggered during a phone conversation.It's also been pointed out that switching from a cell phone or landline to an internet-based telephone service has implications for emergency services. For example, theFCC lists a series of limitations to 911 servicewhen home owners rely on internet-based (or VoIP) services.Calls may not be routed directly to an emergency center, locational information may not be available to emergency responders and, in a power outage, internet telephones go offline without battery backups.7 Tech Stocks That Could Implode at Any MinuteDespite the challenges,The Wall Street Journalsays its sources are convinced Amazon and Google will move forward, calling the move to telephone capability ""the logical next step for the artificial intelligence-powered speakers."" And, that move could happen later this year.The question is, knowing that there are some privacy concerns and potential safety issues in doing so, would you ditch your landline and use an Amazon Echo as your home's new telephone?As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace7 Stocks to Sell or Short Before the Bears StrikeBank of America Corp (BAC) Stock Is Going to $30 This Year7 Stocks Warren Buffett Is Buying or SellingThe postWould You Ditch Your Home Phone for Amazon.com, Inc.

Apple Inc. (AAPL) Careens Closer to Major AR Announcement;2/16/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) CEO Tim Cook has been talking an awful lot lately about augmented reality - or AR. The latest episode was last week, when hecompared the technology to the iPhonein terms of its potential to be big.makeArticleAd();Source: NanticAfter months of repeatedly playing up AR in public, it's beginning to feel as if Cook is setting the expectations of the press and public about the technology.That begs the question: Is Apple Inc. planning a major augmented reality announcement?AR vs. VR: What's the Difference?Augmented reality is related to virtual reality - or VR - but the two are also very different.Virtual reality uses technology to completely immerse people in a virtual world. This requires powerful computing hardware and special headgear. VR has spent several years as the next big thing, culminating withFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) buying VR pioneer Oculus for $2 billion in 2014.Virtual reality hasn't quite caught on in a big way - the expensive and awkward equipment is a big hurdle to overcome - but gamers have begun embracing it.7 Stocks Warren Buffett Is Buying or SellingSo far, Apple has shown no interest in virtual reality and Tim Cook has actually made a point in several interviews of downplaying VR. In the latest, when Cook spoke toThe Independent, he laments the fact that virtual reality""closes the world out.""""Most people don't want to lock themselves out from the world for a long period of time and today you can't do that because you get sick from it.""The antisocial aspects of virtual reality, the equipment requirements and side effects such as motion sickness have been common themes in Cook's argument against virtual reality.However, he is very excited by augmented reality and its ability to go mainstream. Instead of locking a person into a virtual world, AR overlays the existing world with additional information. One of the most popular examples of AR in action is the gamePokemon Go, released last summer. That game was themost downloaded app of 2016on Apple Inc.'s App Store.Is Apple Inc. Planning a Major AR Announcement?Tim Cook's views on augmented reality seem to have been getting more positive in the past few months, reaching the point where he's actively hyping the technology.In October, he said:""I do think that a significant portion of the population of developed countries, and eventually all countries, will have AR experiences every day, almost like eating three meals a day. It will become that much a part of you.""And last week, he toldThe Independent:""I regard it as a big idea like the smartphone. The smartphone is for everyone, we don't have to think the iPhone is about a certain demographic, or country or vertical market: it's for everyone. I think AR is that big, it's huge.""What's holding AR back is the technology.Hardware doesn't need to be as powerful as the silicon needed to drive virtual reality gear. And rather than a fully enclosed headpiece or goggles - that themselves are so complex they can cost $600 on top of the PC needed to drive them - augmented reality can be delivered through specialized eyeglasses or on a smartphone's display. The problem is current efforts haven't been quite good enough.Alphabet Inc's(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) failed Google Glass is the best-known example of the AR overlay glasses model, whilePokemon Goshows the relatively primitive AR experience that current smartphones can deliver.What if Tim Cook has been playing up augmented reality (and dissing VR) because Apple Inc. is preparing to make a major push into AR? It could be the company that takes augmented reality mainstream by nailing the hardware, while everyone else is distracted by trying to get consumers to buy into VR.There has been speculation that Apple is working with German optics firmCarl Zeiss AGonApple-branded AR glasses. The iPhone 8 could also incorporate next generation hardware - from cameras to CPU and GPU - that are optimized to make AR a killer feature.Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock Could Win Big With 'Windows Cloud'We'll have to wait until the company is ready to show its hand to know exactly what is up. But based on Tim Cook's continued promotion of the technology, it seems likely that Apple Inc. is priming us for AR-related announcement.And if Cook is even close to being right about augmented reality having the potential to be as big as the iPhone, the upside for Apple stock could be huge.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace7 Stocks to Sell or Short Before the Bears Strike3 Tire Stocks That Are Burning Rubber in ChinaThe postApple Inc.

BlackRock, Inc. (BLK) Stock Is the Best Investment of the Century;2/16/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSince going public in 1999, the asset management firm known asBlackRock Inc.(NYSE:BLK) has been the best investment of the 21st century.makeArticleAd();Yes, it's better thanAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN), a lot better. It's up 2,670% in that time, and it has been paying dividends in a rising stream since 2003. Payouts started at 20 cents per share and now bring in $2.50 each quarter. An income investor who got in on the 1999 IPO, paying $14 per share, is now collecting $10 per share in dividends each year.Some of the capital gains are a trick of the light. BlackRock did not participate in the ""dot-bomb,"" the collapse of Internet stocks that began in early 2000 afterTime Warner Inc(NYSE:TWX) gave AOL 60% of its equity in a merger. BlackRock doubled in value that year.If you start calculating after the dot-bomb wreckage cleared, BlackRock is up ""only"" 1,000%, against a nearly 5,400% gain for Amazon during that time.Alphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL) has also outpaced it since going public in 2004.The point is that with few exceptions, like the 2008 stock market collapse, the value of BLK stock has consistently increased. And, even during that crisis - where its market cap was cut in half and other companies collapsed completely - BlackRock did not cut that dividend.America's Best Banker?CEO and co-founder Larry Fink is not often mentioned in the same breath as bankers like Jamie Dimon ofJPMorgan Chase & Co.(NYSE:JPM) or Lloyd Blankfein ofGoldman Sachs Group Inc(NYSE:GS); he just does better for his investors.7 Dividend Stocks for the Retirement You DeserveBlackRock wasfounded in 1988with operating capital from Pete Peterson of the Blackstone Group, from which it separated in 1995 after a dispute withStephen Schwarzmann, orchestrated withPNC Financial Services Group Inc(NYSE:PNC), whose investment arm came into BlackRock in 1998. BLK went public a year later at $14 per share.Since then, Fink has gone from strength to strength. BlackRock was hired to clean up the mess of the 2008 meltdown. BlackRock Solutions unwound the toxic mortgage assets. Plus, the same year it was hired for that job (2009), BlackRock acquired Barclays Global Investors and its iShares franchise.BlackRock's tech assets include Aladdin, an investment system from BlackRock Solutions, andiRetire, a retirement investment framework offered by other financial advisors.Hedge in the Age of TrumpAs BlackRock has grown, it has developed a knack for taking deals others wouldn't even consider - and making them work.Right now, for instance, BlackRock is spending $500 million renovating the Willis (nee Sears) Tower in Chicago. In 2015, BLK bought the 108-story landmark, the world's tallest building when completed in 1973, for $1.3 billion.For BlackRock, that's a small deal, actually. It's currently buying First Reserve Energy Infrastructure Funds, a $3.7 billion owner of income-producing energy projects like mid-stream pipelines, grabbing for Trump's infrastructure moneywith both hands.Fink is skeptical of the Trump rally, and of the President's plans for the dollar. Fink still loves the Mexican peso and is worried about the future of the global economy in the age of Trump. But, BlackRock keeps politics and business separate, its response to the travel ban mainly a letter to employees.BlackRock's ETF business hasmore than $1 trillion in assets.It considers Russia a buy, but is skeptical of Brexit, even while former UK Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne joins BLK as an adviser.Trade Apple, Inc. or Own It? I Have the Answer!During the fourth quarter of 2016, BlackRock againbeat analyst estimates, earning $852 million, $5.14 per share, on revenue of $2.89 billion. It brought approximately one-third of revenue to the net income line because most of its money came in the form of investment advisory fees, from administration fees and securities lending.Bottom Line for BlackRock StockWhen BlackRock plunges into a stock, it can hold up, despite real business pressures. An example isGoPro Inc(NASDAQ:GPRO) - without BlackRock's investment, the company might be worthless now. Similarly, BLK's growing investment inFirst Data Corp(NYSE:FDC), the transaction processing company,also made headlines.BlackRock operates passively, and its growth - considering the sheer size of its investment portfolio -concerns some reporters and regulators.Don't let yourself be counted among them. This is one of those stocks which, likeApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL), you can buy, put away and generally ignore, while still remaining confident of solid returns. BLK stock has a 20-year track record of stellar performance, and the founders remain at their desks.Dana Blankenhornis a financial and technology journalist.

Trade Apple, Inc. or Own It? I Have the Answer!;2/16/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWe've all heard the argument that it's wrong to tradeApple, Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL). Many prominent experts rage over those who dare to trade around the price action of AAPL stock. It is confusing to investors to figure out who is wrong. Sure, I could spend a few hours parsing data and calculating returns while making assumptions of entry and exit spots. Or, I can accept the fact that they are both right to a degree.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockOn the one hand, it is undeniable that owning Apple stock for decades has been a winning proposition. But so was trading around the chop. It comes down to what works for each us individually. Most investors enter positions but get stopped out when things go wrong. So I will refrain from judging which group is smarter.I found neutral ground using AAPL options. I commit to Apple long-term, especially when it falls out of favor, and leave myself room for error. I do so with no money out of pocket, thereby rendering my risk to a fraction of owning the stock.Last month, I created $5 per contract out of thin air trading AAPL stock when ithad appeared to be too late. Even more recently, I repeated for another $1.2 yield in mere days.This strategy is easy to do on equities that are solid and what some would consider sure things like AAPL orAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL). I am less easy about doing this with sayNetflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX). With stocks that are perceived to be risky,such as Netflix, I would need to be pickier with my entry and exit points.Today, I want to repeat performance regardless of which whale bought Apple or who sold it.How to Trade AAPL Stock HereThe Trade - Long AAPL:Sell the AAPL 2018 $105 put for $2.70 to open. The 22% price buffer from current levels translate into a 90% theoretical chance of success. I only sell naked puts if I am willing and able to own AAPL stock at the strike sold. Some investors prefer spreading the risk into a credit put spread instead, and that works too.7 Stocks Warren Buffett Is Buying or SellingClick to EnlargeI have been a longtime harsh critic of Tim Cook, so I don't count myself as an AAPL bull, but I do know how to do math. Apple's valuation makes sense at $100 or even $200 per share given current conditions. So I do trust selling risk against that fact rather than chase hope that Tim Cook is able to grow the company.For now, he has a boulder that is hard to stop, and I can count on buyers to support the price.I realize that markets are at all-time highs and precariously perched. So I could buy sacrifice puts in AAPL stock to guard against a market crash. For example, I could spend 20 cents buying the AAPL Jun $100 put to limit my loss if we fall off a cliff in the next four months.I am not required to hold my trades through expiration. I can close it for partial gains or losses at any time.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director ofSellSpreads.com.

TripAdvisor (TRIP) Q4 Earnings & Revenues Miss Estimates;2/16/2017;"TripAdvisor Inc.TRIPreported adjusted fourth-quarter 2016 earnings of 5 cents per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 13 cents. Adjusted earnings exclude one-time items but include stock-based compensation expense.The decrease was due to lower display advertising and subscription revenues. Management stated that the instant booking rollout led to significant revenue headwinds in 2016, muting revenue growth, thereby impacting profitability.Shares of the online travel research company were down more than 5% in response to the weak fourth-quarter results.Over the past one year, shares of TripAdvisor underperformed the Zacks categorized Electronic Commerce industry. While the industry gained 50.25%, the stock incurred a loss of 20.56%.RevenuesTripAdvisor reported revenues of $316.0 million in the fourth quarter, down 24.9% sequentially but up 2.3% year over year. The sequential decrease was due to some softness in display and subscription revenues. Also, revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $326 million.Earlier, TripAdvisor had changed its reportable segments to reflect changes in management's reporting structure. The new segments are Hotel and Other.Revenues of $252.0 million from theHotelsegment were down 21% sequentially and 3% from the year-ago quarter but made up 80% of total revenue. This segment includes click, display, subscription and transaction-based revenues from hotels, air and cruise, including that from the company's largest subsidiary, SmarterTravel, as well as from operations in China.Revenues of $64.0 million from theOthersegment decreased 37% sequentially but increased 31% year over year and contributed the remaining 20% of the total revenue. This segment includes revenues from attractions, restaurants and vacation rentals businesses.Revenues by SourceRevenues of $154.0 million from Click-based advertising were flat from the year-ago quarter and accounted for 49% of total revenue.

The share repurchase program authorized by the Board of Directors in February 2013 has been completed.Our TakeTripAdvisor is an online travel research company that features reviews and advice on hotels, resorts, flights, vacation rentals, vacation packages and travel guides, to name a few. The company reported a weak fourth quarter with both the top line and the bottom line missing our estimates.The company's solid fundamentals, growth initiatives, partnerships to boost hotel bookings, strong focus on developing its mobile products, expansion into the international restaurant reservation space and improvement in user growth and engagement, especially related to mobile devices will help the company achieve desired results.Additionally, TripAdvisor's acquisitions complement its travel product portfolio. These also improve efficiency and expand user base, on the one hand, while increasing traffic, hotel shoppers and profits, on the other. Over the long term, the company is well positioned to grow, given its expanding user base, improving margins and increasing monetization of social and mobile platforms.However, mounting expenses due to new initiatives and investments are hurting the company's profits.

Get a Free Refill on Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM);2/15/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsLast fall whenExxon Mobil Corporation(NYSE:XOM) fell hard, I wrote onhow to catch a falling machete. The trade was profitable and I have since booked it. On this dip, I want to reload the same setup for the opportunity for more profits.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockI am not one who likes to reinvent the wheel, so I will retrace my steps almost exactly from the last time I traded XOM stock.Since my last trade, oil prices overcame the $50 crude oil resistance price and established it as support. But they still haven't lived up to the entire upside measured move that should have taken out $58 per barrel. So crude oil prices are now stuck in a range.One major development since last fall is that OPEC is now committed to defending energy prices, so I don't anticipate oil falling too far. Consequently, I view any weakness in XOM stock as temporary and that buyers will step in to defend XOM stock.7 Tech Stocks That Could Implode at Any MinuteClick to EnlargeFundamentally, XOM andChevron Corporation(NYSE:CVX) are giants with little worry over their viability. However, technically XOM is at a must-bounce level. Else, and if it loses current levels, it could invite more technical sellers and retest $79 per share.This is not a forecast, but I do have to acknowledge it as a possibility.XOM Stock Trade IdeaThe Trade - Long XOM:Sell Jan 2018 $65 put. For this I collect $1.5 per contract to open. I only sell naked puts if I am willing and able to own the stock at the strike sold. I need XOM stock to stay above my strike sold. I have a 90% theoretical chance of success with this 21% buffer from current price. My breakeven price is $63.50 per share.I chose $65 per share because it gives me room for error and it puts my risk below recent lows.Selling naked puts is not appropriate for all investors. Luckily, I can modify the trade to better suit more conservative risk tastes.The Alternate Trade - Less Aggressively Long XOM:Sell the Jan 2018 $70/$67.50 credit put spread. This is a bullish trade for which I collected 40 cents per contract to open. I have a 95% theoretical chance of success to yield 17%. I have to note that the tradeoff for having a limited loss, this trade has a slightly smaller price buffer from current levels.Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Holders Shouldn't Worry About OracleI am not selling opposing credit spreads to hedge the trade. Instead I will closely manage the risk. I don't like to sell credit call spreads after a sharp drop in price like XOM has recently had.I can close it at any time for partial gains or losses. I may need to manage this risk through future earnings reports. The short-term price reactions earnings report are often a coin flip.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director ofSellSpreads.com.

Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Holders Shouldn’t Worry About Oracle;2/15/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAll too much like James Cameron's 2009 sci-fi flickAvatar, just when you think the feud betweenAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) andOracle Corporation(NYSE:ORCL) is over, you find out it's not.* Last week, the iconic database company told the iconic search engine company it was appealing a ruling made against Oracle - in favor of Alphabet - in May of last year.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockFor better or worse, GOOGL stock owners either didn't hear, or didn't care. If it's the latter, it's not terribly surprising. The company formerly known as Google is sued on a regular basis, often by parties with weak cases just looking for a payday.GOOGL shareholders may want to take a closer look this time around though. While successful appeal cases are tough, Oracle's argument holds slightly more water than the typical long-shot caselike the one Vringo levied (and ultimately lost) back in 2014. Moreover, the case itself could have significant repercussions for other outfits in the heat of similar arguments about open source software.GOOGL: Here We Go AgainWarning: You may need to read through the intricacies of this case twice to fully understand what's going on, and even then, there's no guarantee it will make complete sense. Here's the crux of the argument though … Oracle says Alphabet used a little too much of its Java software - which is free, open-source software - in its Android operating system.The suit largely hinges on what constitutes ""fair use"" of open-source and freely-available software.7 Stocks to Buy for the Future of TVWhile Oracle offers Java for any consumer to download and any developer to utilize pieces of, the company contends it was never intended for wide swaths of the code to be cut and pasted and utilized as part of a commercial, revenue-bearing system.The complaint specifically read:""The undisputed evidence showed that Google verbatim copied the heart of Oracle's creative work for an entirely commercial purpose without any change to Oracle's expressive content or message, took far more than necessary to program in the Java language, and, in so doing, harmed the market for Java.""The strength of Oracle's copyrights on its application programming interfaces, or APIs, was particularlyemphasizedby the company in the prior jury trial.Alphabet's counterargument is simpler -CEO Larry Page said, ""We didn't pay for the free and open things.""If all of this rings a bell with GOOGL stock owners, there's a reason. This argument has been waged in a courtroom a few times, going back as far as 2010. The current stage for this battle of the titans is an appeal of last year's loss suffered by Oracle. That case's loss likely saved Alphabet Inc from being forced to pay the $9 billion in damages Oracle was seeking.Bottom Line for GOOGL Stock, and OthersOwners of GOOGL stock don't have a great deal to worry about here. The courts sided with the company in the most recent case, and appeals - a reversal of a prior judgment - are very difficult win.The case, though, will have far-reaching consequences beyond the Alphabet/Oracle tiff. In essence, this contest could largely help affirm just how ""open"" open source code really is even if its user ends up commercializing it as Alphabet did with Java via Android. Perhaps in a bigger sense though, this trial will once again serve as an indictment on decency (or lack thereof) and common sense (or, again, lack thereof).Why Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock Could Fly to $1,000 in 2017While not a legal matter raised during any of the lawsuits' arguments, all juror's minds were apt to be asking themselves why Oracle would offer Java in part or in whole for free - even for commercial uses - if it didn't want it to be used this extensively.Another relevant but unasked question is why Java's original developer, Sun Microsystems, supported Android's use of the platform before Oracle acquired Sun, but Oracle switched gears on the stance after buying Sun Microsystems. And, perhaps if Oracle had been more clear about how its rampant use of it in the Android OS had ""harmed the market for Java"" when it's not really otherwise monetized, a judge and jury could have been a little more sympathetic.As it stands though, the Oracle argument looks to be founded more on regret and frustration and less on merits. The courts so far seem to be picking up on that.Broadly speaking, it all bodes well for other entities that have somehow commercialized open source software and APIs.* Avatar, while a stunningly successful film, was a three hour epic, and could have easily ended at two points in the film before the third (and actual) ending.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 Super-Safe Dividend Growth Stocks to Buy Today10 Stocks to Buy That Already Make America GreatThe postAlphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Holders Shouldn't Worry About Oracleappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Should I Buy General Motors Company (GM) Stock? 3 Pros, 3 Cons;2/15/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsGeneral Motors Company(NYSE:GM) has certainly made a tremendous comeback since 2008, after having to declare bankruptcy. But there has been little for investors to cheer about. Back in late 2010, the company pulled off its IPO at $33 a share. But now GM stock is at only $37.20.makeArticleAd();Source:William Oliver via Flickr (Modified)To put things into perspective,InvestorPlace.com'sDana Blankenhorn has noted: ""Ever since the 2008 crash and government bailout, General Motors stock has been treated like dirt. No matter what GM does, it can't get out of first gear.""I actually think this is an understatement!Of course, Wall Street can be inexplicable. Yet eventually investors will recognize the value. Hey, this has happened with other stocks that languished for a long time, such asMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT), right?OK then, so would GM stock be a good play right now? Or should investors hold off? Well, to see, let's take a look at 3 pros and cons on General Motors:3 Pros On GM StockMomentum: For the past two years, General Motors has posted record earnings, net revenues, EBITDA and free cash flows. As forlast year, revenues increased by 9.2% to $166.4 billion and free cash flows came to $6.9 billion, up $4.7 billion from the previous year.7 Tech Stocks That Could Implode at Any MinuteThen again, General Motors has continued to pump out popular cars, with global sales at 10 million (making the company the No. 3 player). A big part of this has been the continued success in North America. But of course, China remains a major factor as well. Last year GM reported3.87 million car sales in the country. Keep in mind that the company sells more in China than any country, including the U.S.But GM has also been judicious with discounts and promotions. For the most part, GM is focused on making sure it makes profits, not just on increasing marketshare.Innovation: One of the hottest categories in technology is the auto industry, as seen with the efforts with operators likeAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG),Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) andTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA). The good news is that GM has been ramping up its investments. To this end, the company made a $500 million investment inLyft(a top ride-sharing startup) as well as a $1 billion acquisition ofCruise Automation(a developer of autonomous car systems).Already there are signs that GM is getting traction. For example, the company is testing over 40 autonomous Bolt EVs. But there are also some other innovations, like Maven. This is a mobile platform that allows a person to search and reserve a car and unlock it with a smartphone. According toGM: ""With more than 25 million customers around the world projected to use some form of shared mobility by 2020, Maven is a key element of our strategy to changing ownership models in the automotive industry.""It's important to note that GM has the advantage of leveraging its experience with OnStar, which has been around for two decades. In fact, during this time, the system has logged about1.5 billion customer interactions.Yield & Valuation: GM has certainly been shareholder friendly. Last year, the company returned a hefty $4.8 billion - in a combination of share buybacks and dividends. In fact, GM stock has a nice yield of 4.1%.But the valuation is also attractive. Consider that the forward price-to-earnings ratio is at a lowly 6.1X. True, this may be deserved for a company that is showing declining growth. But as for General Motors, the company expects to increase the top line for 2017.In other words, the stock does look like a great value play right now.3 Cons on GM StockCompetition: The environment is brutal. And with more dealmaking, things will only get more intense. An example of this is the alliance ofRenault SAandNissan Motor Co Ltd (ADR)(OTCMKTS:NSANY) - which also involved the purchase of a large stake inMitsubishi Motors. With this, the companies were able to realize significant cost savings and also hit a global sales number of nearly 10 million last year.Although, accordingFiat SpA(ADR)(OTCMKTS:FIATY) CEO Sergio Marchionne, an automaker may need to reach levels of15 million cars sold annually to be competitive! The reason is that R&D will inevitably increase because of the enormous costs of new technologies.As a result, a company like GM may have little choice but to look for a similar alliance or a transformative acquisition, which would definitely be risky and expensive.Politics: The election of Donald Trump is a wild card for the auto industry. On the one hand, there are potential positives, such as with lower corporate tax rates and less onerous regulations.But these may not offset the issues with Trump's anti-trade bent. If there is a border tax, this could hurt GM because of its substantial production in Mexico. Actually, about 20% of light production is in the country. So if there is a border tax, it could mean higher prices in the U.S. - and yes, lower sales. According to theWall Street Journal: ""Even a more modest border tax under consideration would wipe out a quarter of GM's regional profit.""Global Issues:While the markets in China and North America have been robust for GM, there has been much softness in many other areas, such as in Europe and South America. Granted, there are signs of improvement - but the progress has been fairly slow. For example, in South America, GM has been able to cut back on the losses. But there was still $374 million in red ink last year.As for Europe, the growth has been sluggish across the continent. It also does not help that England has enacted the Brexit, which has caused a lot of uncertainty. As a result, GM lost $300 million in Europe last year and it appears there will not be break-even until 2018. To put things into perspective, the company has not seen a profit in the region since 2000!Bottom Line On GM StockPerhaps the biggest issue facing GM stock is the uncertainty regarding Trump's trade actions. Although, given the importance of the auto industry to the US economy, it does seem reasonable that any moves will likely be taken with care. Besides, General Motors CEO Mary Barra has been savvy to meet with Trump several times already.Gas Up With Chesapeake Energy Corporation (CHK) StockIn the meantime, she is doing a great job managing the core operations of the company. Note that there will be 18 new or refreshed models for five main brands in 2017, up from 13 last year. And yes, Barra has been aggressive with investments in new technologies.OK, so is GM stock a good buy right now? I think so, especially given the rock-bottom valuation.Tom Taulli runs the InvestorPlace blogIPO Playbookand also has his own free iOS app to estimate your tax refund, which is atPathwayTax.com.Follow him on Twitter at@ttaulli.

The founder director tweeted the news with the hashtag ""#Love Twitter"" from his account. The news led to an upside in Twitter's share price.Twitter, Inc. PriceTwitter, Inc. Price|Twitter, Inc. QuoteNotably, Twitter's shares have largely underperformed the broader market. The company has been witnessing sluggish user expansion and revenues have grown just 1% year over year in the recently reported quarter. We note that Dorsey's strategy of focusing on live and user friendly changes have not generated the desired results for Twitter.Amid the exodus of top level executives and poor quarterly results, the latest development has managed to generate considerable momentum for the company and rekindle investors' interest.Previously, Dorsey had gained around $11 million by selling his shares in Square Inc. The move to buy Twitter shares can be seen as Dorsey's effort to reassure dismayed investors who have been on the edge given its unabated troubles.   Generally it is said that when a founder buys shares of his own company, it implies that the stock has much upside potential.Dorsey has often been widely criticized for playing the dual responsibilities of heading both Twitter and Square, especially when both the companies are at crucial junctures. Dorsey was quoted by media reports saying ""My intention is to serve both companies in every way I know how and make sure that we are really focused on what's most important for each.""Last year, rumors about Twitter's probable sale did the rounds. Big names like AlphabetGOOGLand The Walt Disney CompanyDISwere speculated to have shown interest in buying the micro blogging site. But there was a twist in its 'takeover' tale with most bidders pulling out of the race. Reportedly, profitability issues, stagnant user growth and infamous trolling incidents did not do much justice to the estimated bid price of $16 to $20 billion.Zacks Rank & Stock MovementAt present, Twitter has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We note that Twitter has vastly underperformed the Zacks categorizedInternet Softwareindustry inthe last one year. The company's shares increased 0.98% compared with the industry's gain of 23.18% during that period.Key PickA better-ranked stock in the wider technology space is Oclaro Inc.OCLR, which carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: Twitter and Alphabet;2/15/2017;"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL - February 15, 2017 - Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Features: Twitter (NYSE:TWTR-Free Report)and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL-Free Report).How Twitter Can Fix Itself by Learning from YouTubeWhen Donald Trump first began gaining some momentum in the presidential race, it looked to be pretty fantastic news for Twitter (NYSE:TWTR-Free Report), and investors in the social networking giant too. After all, Trump would frequently go onto the site to announce new plans or fight back against his detractors. It was (and continues to be) an incredible resource for political updates.Now that Trump is President, his tweets move markets. His attacks on companies can send share prices lower in a heartbeat and are an important thing to consider for investors these days. Some haveset up apps to track his tweetsand how they relate to the market. Others do a tweet analysis in order to get better insight into the mind of the President, includingThe Atlantic'sTrump Tweet Tracker.But beyond Trump, Twitter also managed to become the single greatest collection of primary sources of all-time. When breaking news happens, it is almost always reported first hand on Twitter, and then it is disseminated out from there.You'd think that these factors alone would make Twitter an unstoppable media juggernaut. A must for journalists and those seeking to stay up-to-date on the news alike. So how has Twitter capitalized on this incredible timing and presidential stroke of luck? Well, in short, it hasn't.Bad Earnings Report AgainThe company posted yet another disappointing quarter for Q4, missing expectations on the revenue front and posting shockingly poor active user figures. It remains stuck around the 320 million active monthly user mark, and can't even seem to grow revenues either. Add in disappointing adjusted earnings guidance, and it isn't a great situation by any stretch forTWTRinvestors these days, especially given that the company has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).And let's remember, these figures are with the leader of the free world literally using the service to clarify policy and goals on a regular basis. The environment cannot possibly get any better for Twitter. Its product is in the news on a near hourly basis at this point and it still can't find a way to get the job done.Clearly, Twitter needs a shakeup and it needs a bit of a Hail-Mary in order to get back into investors' good graces. So, what can the company do?Twitter Needs to Copy YouTube. Now.Fortunately for Twitter, the path to relevancy and growth is already laid out before them. The good folks at Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL-Free Report) have already done all the hard work in their YouTube division and Twitter needs only to copy their best practices.First and foremost is capitalizing on the incredible missed opportunity of getting an ad right on to tweets. As you can see in the picture below, there is always a big white box at the bottom right hand corner of each tweet.Why not fill that with a small advertisement? Sure, some people are not going to like that, but people will adjust accordingly. We saw something similar with YouTube where at first only certain videos had ads, and now nearly everything has an advertisement before the video. People have adapted and it has become the norm to see this before a video. People will do the same with Twitter (and embedded tweets) and this will help with casual users (much the same way embedding helped with casual YouTubers).After all, these casual users who mostly see tweets embedded somewhere else make up a huge base of people and are arguably the key to Twitter's success. Finding a way to make money off these people-much like how YouTube doesn't need you to be signed in or making videos to make revenue off of you-should be paramount in Twitter's near term plans.According to Twitter,embedded tweets reach more than a billion peopleeach month across the web, a truly massive figure. And that number is actually from before Donald Trump burst onto the scene and tweets were on the nightly news on a regular basis.But what if people hate this idea and recoil from the service? Well, an easy way to placate people will be to pay the content generators for the work they are doing. Giving tweeters a slice of the ad revenue that they generate would go a long way to getting people and small businesses to tweet more, and it is pretty much akin to what YouTube does with their stars. AndTwitter has even looked to do this on the video side, so why not extend it over to their bread and butter anyway?Bottom LineAre some of these ideas going to be popular? Definitely not. But Twitter needs to try something in order to jumpstart its floundering share price and lackluster growth. Everything needs to be on the table, and now is the time to do it.The company finds itself in a truly historic position and it is an opportunity that isn't going to come around every four years. The confluence of Trump and the increased desire for real-time (and unfiltered) news from around the globe should be a godsend for Twitter, but the company has completely failed to capitalize on the trend.Taking some of YouTube's best practices might be a good place to start in order to return to relevancy though. It certainly has a better shot of reviving the stock than anything Twitter has come up with recently, and it could push TWTR back towards growth too.And a position of growth would make Twitter a much better candidate for a takeover, perhaps from a company like Alphabet. Such a partnership makes a lot of sense and it would allow better integration between Google search results and tweets, while the melding of tweets and YouTube comments would be a great match as well.So, if Twitter wants to get to this end-which seems like the best possible outcome for TWTR investors at this point-take a page out of YouTube's book and start thinking about ways to get more ads out there, and how to benefit creators in the process. Because if Twitter can't take some risks and find a way to make things work when their service is at the forefront of news and popular culture like it is now, they never will.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your   inbox?Zacks' free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.Get it free >>Get the full Report on TWTR - FREEGet the full Report on GOOGL - FREEFollow us on Twitter:https://twitter.com/ZacksResearchJoin us on Facebook:https://www.facebook.com/ZacksInvestmentResearchZacks Investment Research is under common control with affiliated entities (including a broker-dealer and an investment adviser), which may engage in transactions involving the foregoing securities for the clients of such affiliates.Media ContactZacks Investment Research800-767-3771 ext. 9339support@zacks.comhttps://www.zacks.com/performancePast performance is no guarantee of future results.

Facebook (FB) Launches New TV App for Apple TV & Others;2/15/2017;"Social media giant,Facebook Inc.FBhas unveiled a new TV app to enhance the video viewing experience. The app will be initially available on app stores on Apple TV, Amazon Fire TV and Samsung Smart TV and will be rolled out to other platforms gradually.In a blog post, Facebook said that the app will enable users to ""watch videos shared by friends or Pages you follow, top live videos from around the world, and recommended videos based on your interests."" Currently, Facebook enables users to stream videos on their TVs from their Facebook page.Facebook, Inc. PriceFacebook, Inc. Price|Facebook, Inc. QuoteFurther in the post, Facebook said that going forward, mobile users will be able to hear sound automatically in their news feed. Earlier, one had to tap on the video to listen but with the new feed, there is no need for that. Users can choose to ""disable"" the feature by switching off ""Videos in News Feed Start With Sound"" in Settings. Also, Facebook has improved vertical video experiencing on mobile phones by incorporating a ""larger format."" The company also introduced a picture-in-picture view that will help users to watch videos and scroll at the same time.As video ads generate more revenues than its photo and text-based substitutes, Facebook and a host of several others social media sites like TwitterTWTR) and Snapchat are trying to incorporate more and more video oriented content to bring in more ad dollars. Ad revenues contribute over 90% to Facebook's total revenue. Per media reports, Facebook is looking to grab a share of the reportedly $70 billon brand advertising that is allocated to linear TV by increasing video content on its platform.  At its last earnings call, Facebook said that video emerged as a ""megatrend"" on the same lines like mobile.However, Facebook is yet to work out an ad model for live video. Given CEO Mark Zuckerberg's aversion to pre roll ads, Facebook is reportedly testing a new ad platform - mid roll format - whereby publishers will be able to put in ads in a video (which has a minimum duration of 90 seconds) after a user has played it for 20 seconds or more. Reports add that Facebook will share revenues with publishers in a 45:55 ratio, similar to that of Alphabet'sGOOGLYouTube.At present, Facebook has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Moreover, we note that Facebook has outperformed the Zacks categorizedInternet Servicesindustry in the last one year. The company's shares increased 31.21% compared with the industry's gain of 18.26%.Key PickA better-ranked stock in the wider technology space is MeetMe IncMEET, which carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

How Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Turns Lemons Into Profits;2/14/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOver the past few months,Facebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) has had to revise its advertising metrics several times to account for errors. For the most part, the errors seem relatively minor and have had little impact on FB stock.makeArticleAd();Source:Via Stock SnapIn September, management disclosed that the reported figure of average time spent viewing a video was inflated. A company post in November cited a summary figure of ""reach"" (the number of Facebook users who viewed an impression in their timeline) as being overstated.In two more posts the following month, further problems were announced and more changes were made. The company changed its methodology for measuring reach (not just reporting the figure). ""Reactions"" to live video were mis-allocated, and counts for ""likes"" and ""shares"" had been miscalculated.Again, Facebook stock investors seem relatively unconcerned. In fact, the FB stock price sits at an all-time high. But, combined with general concerns about ""click fraud"" and other problems in the online advertising space, the metric changes highlight a key issue for Facebook - and online advertising as a whole.How Facebook responds as a company will be key for Facebook stock.Click Fraud, Bots and Facebook's ResponseIn a widely cited figure, the Association of National Advertisers estimated that online ad fraud would cost $7.2 billion in 2016. (Bear in mind that Facebook alone generated $27 billion in revenue last year.) Estimates of how many ads are fraudulent range from 30%-60%. Indeed, many analysts have forecast a collapse in the online advertising space as a whole.7 Stocks to Buy That Could Double by 2018Much of the questionable activity comes from bots, which mimic actual online users. There are also ""click farms,"" malware and display tactics such as ""pop-under"" ads, which are rarely, if ever, seen. Most of the complaints are directed at traffic generators and other middlemen. But, some argue that programmatic marketplace operators such asRocket Fuel Inc(NASDAQ:FUEL) andCriteo SA (ADR)(NASDAQ:CRTO) are turning a blind eye to these issues.Facebook is not implicated in these tactics. In fact, the company's efforts outside the platform have shown a notable willingness to fight low-quality tactics. In 2016, Facebook shut down its Atlas ad-buying platform. Its head of ad tech wrote in a blog post, ""We were amazed by the volume of valueless inventory"" coming into that exchange. That poor traffic was a key reason for management's decision to move on.Another unit, LiveRail, was shut down last year as well. Facebook paid a reported $400 million-$500 million for that company, with the goal of building a video ad exchange. But, similar to Atlas, fraud and traffic concerns led FB to shut down the ad exchange. (In both cases, Facebook has salvaged measurement capabilities from the business.)The irony of the questions surrounding Facebook's metric changes is that, so far, when confronted with the worst of the worst in online advertising, the company has acted in a seemingly ethical manner.But the question for FB stock is what the apparently worsening state of ad tech means going forward.Are Growing Ad Tech Concerns a Plus or Minus for Facebook Stock?The core concern regarding not just fraud, but poor measurement of online advertising impressions and click-throughs, is that advertisers can't accurately gauge ROI. Facebook's recent measurement errors - including inflated video duration figures for more than two years - seem of a piece with that concern.There are other issues with the Facebook platform, too, including fake accounts, for instance. In the filings ahead of the Facebook IPO, the company estimated that 8.7% of accounts were fake. That figure was later updated to a range of 5%-11%. Click farms lead to paid promotions for users that aren't real potential customers. The same issues that plague online advertising more generally seem to pop up for advertisers on Facebook as well.But, there's an argument that the problems in online advertising could represent another growth driver for Facebook stock. The company's closed ecosystem eliminates many of the middlemen that are alleged to cause the disruption in programmatic marketplaces. While there are fraud problems, management continues to aggressively work to resolve those problems.Facebook's long-term growth potential - which, in the end, will drive FB stock - is based on happy customers. But keeping happy customers means Facebook must fix any potential fraud problems as quickly and aggressively as possible.Facebook is doing just that. Management announced last week that it would submit to third-party auditing by the non-profit Media Rating Council. Twenty-four third-party companies now have access to the platform to improve measurement. FB is providing more data, and more options for buying as well.Why Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Holders Shouldn't Sweat SnapchatIf the concerns about online advertising are accurate - and there's an awful lot of evidence at this point - Facebook seems better-positioned than its rivals, should advertisers pull back. Rather, Criteo, Rocket Fuel and evenAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL) seem far more at risk.In that scenario, actually, Facebook's attractiveness to advertisers would onlyincrease. A closed platform, improved measurement capabilities and third-party verification would offer confidence to those advertisers not available elsewhere on the Web.And that would be a boon for FB stock.As of this writing, Vince Martin did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceThe 3 Best Bear Trades on Wall Street Right Now7 Dividend Stocks for the Retirement You DeserveApple Inc.

Apple at All-Time High: Poised for More Growth as Anticipation for Next iPhone Builds;2/14/2017;"In anticipation of its 10thanniversary iPhone, due out this spring, Apple Inc.AAPLlooks poised to build on its already stellar 2017. The tech giant closed Monday at an all-time high of $133.31 per share in after-hours trading, jumping 0.9%, and it is up to $134.19 after early Tuesday morning trading. Apple's stock is up 15% since the beginning of 2017.The company posted all-time high quarterly revenue of $78.4 billion in its first fiscal quarter of 2017, which ended December 31, 2016. Apple has once again reached an elusive $700 billion market value, after becoming the first publicly traded U.S. company to do so in February 2015. The $700 billion value places the company firmly at the top of the U.S. food chain, nearly $120 billion above GoogleGOOGL, now Alphabet.""We're thrilled to report that our holiday quarter results generated Apple's highest quarterly revenue ever, and broke multiple records along the way,"" Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a press release.""We sold more iPhones than ever before and set all-time revenue records for iPhone, Services, Mac and Apple Watch. Revenue from Services grew strongly over last year, led by record customer activity on the App Store, and we are very excited about the products in our pipeline.""The company's flagship product, the iPhone, was born on June 29, 2007. The transformative smartphone helped catapult Apple to where it is today.Now, nearly a decade later, details of the iPhone 8, or the iPhone X, a rumored name, might just pack enough new features to encourage a huge uptick in purchases. But more importantly, it could signal that Apple is once again making massive jumps in innovation, which the last few iPhones lacked.The normally measured Cook spoke recently about groundbreaking new plans, which could include augmented reality.Leaks about the upcoming iPhone have started to come out,and they are bold. Some of the ""supply chain"" leaks suggest Apple's new iPhone ""will change this industry deeply.""Speculation suggeststhe iPhone 8 could be made almost entirely of glass, charge wirelessly and come in three different sizes.It could also have an OLED screen, which would help boost battery life dramatically.Cook announced last month Apple's plan to double the company's $24.35 billion services business by 2021. The CEO also suggested upcoming tax reforms would allow the company to bring home cash held overseas to help bolster mergers and acquisitions.International sales accounted for 64% of Apple's first quarter revenue. This is massively important as the company tries to hold ground in highly competitive Asian markets, especially China, the world's largest smartphone market. Part of this growth is due to increased app purchases and streaming music subscriptions.Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc.,BRK.Ahas poured millions of dollars into Apple over the last year, which brings its stake to nearly $1.5 billion. The ""Wizard of Omaha"" backing a company is rarely a bad sign.However, iPad sales have leveled off, and the Apple Watch has not yet made the splash the company has hoped for. But the Apple Watch still claimed63% of the still new smartwatch marketin the fourth quarter. Its second-generation waterproof model could be bigger than the first.And still, Apple's iOS products are on track toreach nearly a trillion dollars in sales.The company's Beats Electronics brand, which it purchased for $3 billion in 2014, holds a lot of cachet in popular culture, including professional sports and music. And their new Airpod earbuds have potential to catch on quickly.An estimated 85% to 90% of iPhone users will buy another iPhone, according to UBS. There are currentlyover 600 million iPhonesbeing used worldwide, many of which are models 6 or lower. This means a lot of people could upgrade this year, especially with the introduction of iPhone X, its most game-changing phone in years.Which Stocks are Zacks Experts Talking About?makeArticleAd();Stocks in today's headlines may be tempting buys, but how would you like to peek behind the curtain to see all the best stocks Zacks' team of experts are recommending?

Operating revenue was a little higher than   expected at 21%. Transactions were $1.8 billion. But the volume   was below expected. Expected was $100 billion and they   delivered $99.3 billion. And that is why share prices are down   about 3.5% this morning. So, it seems like a slight   overreaction when you dig into their numbers. But,   yeah, that's the reason for the share price falling.Lewis:And that's really one of the core metrics that investors tend to   focus on for them as a company, right?Priestley:Absolutely. They really are measured on engagement,   so number of customers, and engagement of those   customers, and the key metrics for those.Lewis:Looking beyond some of the top line numbers, what else   popped up to you in the report?Priestley:The operating margin for the fourth quarter was down   to 15.4%. The reason that we're commenting on this is that   that's a lot, it takes up a lot of room in the bullish   theses, that the new partnerships they've started   with a lot of the banks,Visa,Mastercard, they're going to really pressure their margins down.Lewis:Is the thought there that they're working with very big   institutions and big players, and they just don't have the   negotiating room that they might with some smaller players?Priestley:Absolutely. That's part of it. And also, it's just the   standard transaction payment. It's the same thing forSquareand other payment processors; it's a standard transaction   amount on card processing. So, that 15.4% compared to   16.1% in the fourth quarter of last year -- you can see,   that's quite a decline there. Management has talked about the   fact that they are really doing everything they can to leverage   their other income against this. And I feel like they've done a   pretty good job. Their CEO, Dan Schulman, has said that   they won't be a slave to quarter-to-quarter margin   performance.Lewis:Which is something we like to hear as Foolish investors.Priestley:That's very true. And, I would also comment   that the management team is really being driven for   their compensation package on the long-term performance of   this stock, and I think that really shows in their   reporting. They're focused on free cash flow in   their projects, and what they're delivering to their   customers. Just to give you a couple of the year-over-year   figures: Earnings per share for the year increased 15% to   $1.15. Non-GAAP was $1.50 on guidance of $1.45 to $1.50. That's   pretty good. Revenue for the full year was up 17%, and 21% on a   currency-neutral basis, and they guided for 19%, so they really   beat that.Lewis:Like Alphabet, their fiscal Q4 comes with the calendar   Q4, so we were able to look at full year results   here, and not just the quarterly results. What's going on   with total payment volume? I know that's something that   people really like to focus on with them.Priestley:Yeah, absolutely. If we had seen total payment   volume less than 25%, I think we would have seen a bigger   decline in the stock price. Luckily, for the fourth   quarter, payment volume was up 25%. As I said,   the actual processed amount was $99.3 billion, which missed   the expectations. Interestingly, the majority of this was pushed   by international. International expanded 27%. The U.S. was   23%.Lewis:And for the unacquainted, total payment volume is   just the gross amount that they are helping to   facilitate.Priestley:Yes. The way to look at this is, the total payment   volume is the number of payments that they process. Then,   the transaction is the amount that they process. So,   they're averaging about $56 per transaction right now.   That's slightly down from $60 that they were averaging a   couple quarters ago. But it's still very good.Lewis:So, for the amount per transaction to be down, they must be   doing more total transactions to be making it up in   volume and still be seeing growth, right?Priestley:Yes, you're exactly right. I will also comment   that, of their transactions in their Q4, $100 billion was mobile   payments, which is an increase of 55%, and it's almost a third   now of their transactions processed. Which is fantastic, and I   think the management team has really isolated that as an   opportunity for the company. That's where they're going to really   demonstrate their industry leadership. The market is moving   toward mobile, and they're really pioneering in the mobile   industry.Lewis:So what can people expect looking forward, either first   quarter of 2017 or further out, broadly in 2017?Priestley:Absolutely. I'll look for 2017 quarter four revenue   we're expecting to grow on a currency neutral basis 16%   to 18%. That gives you a range of $2.9 billion to $2.95 billion.   That was actually slightly more conservative   than some analysts were expecting, which played into their   share price performance today. But full-year performance is   strong, revenue growth 15% to 17% and 17% to 19% currency   neutral, which gives you about $12.45 billion to $12.65   billion.Lewis:Is there anything to worry about with some of these   numbers that we're looking at, that management growth   projections are different than what the market is expecting?   Because, they are still very much in growth mode as a   business, and I know that early on, those projections, if they   start to decelerate at all, can start to scare people off a   little bit.Priestley:I think they have been fairly conservative in some of their   estimations, because they really do have a huge potential   with the mobile traffic. I think, if you look at some of   their projects that they're working on now, Venmo has   increased 100% year over year. It wasTime Magazine'sbest app, it's processed $5.6 billion, which was up 126%.   So, I think they have a huge potential with a lot of   the projects they're working on; they've experienced huge   growth. The problem with these is that they are not monetized   yet. And an analyst actually raised the question in the   earnings call: ""Is your projection in 2017 building   in some of the expectations for monetizing this, and   also Xoom?"" which is their international money transfer program.   They dismissed this. They said it was pushing out to 2018,   some of the opportunities, and that they will be   focused on growth. So, I think, for 2017, these might be   conservative estimates. But for 2018, we might actually   start to see the fruits of that labor.Lewis:Yeah, and you said, 55% of what was being processed, broadly   for the business, was coming from mobile. When you look at   Venmo specifically, that is almost entirely mobile. It's   more peer-to-peer. There are some questions about whether or   not they will be able to monetize that very well, and what   that might look like, because me giving you $5 because you   bought me lunch the other day, they don't really take anything on   that.Priestley:No, they don't. And something to say   is, it's becoming a hugely crowded market. I   think PayPal, to some degree, has a first-mover advantage,   but they're definitely not the biggest player in this   industry. The banks have gotten together and created   clearXchange, which is a peer-to-peer payment which is also   free right now. It's owned by the banks, so it has a lot of   clout. Whether or not people pick it up to the rate that they've   picked up Venmo, which is hugely popular with millennials, a   lot of our friends use it all the time, we use it. Also,Apple. Apple has grown hugely. Tim Cook in his last earnings call --   so, this is a bit outdated -- said that 75%   of swiping transactions were from Apple Pay.Lewis:Wow. It's hard to believe. Anecdotally, though, when   I'm out with my friends, and maybe you can lend some color   on this too, if someone covers the tab, I'm paying them via   Venmo. No one is ever like, ""Do you haveBank of Americamobile payment processing?"" So, they do seem to have that   first-mover advantage, and I think they have that name   recognition. When you have that huge installed base, as they do,   it really comes down to whether they can flip the monetization   switch on. I guess investors are going to have to be patient   on that, if management is pushing that out to 2018.Priestley:Absolutely. I will say, they do have a lot of   initiatives that are panning out for them right now. One   Touch basically enables you to fill in your bank   details, and you work through PayPal, and you can just click   one button at the checkout and it's transacted   through PayPal, which is hugely beneficial for   mobile. I don't know about you, but frequently, when   I'm  looking at shoes online, as soon as I get to the   card payment, and you have to zoom in on those small boxes and   put your card numbers in, they lose me. I think it's something   like a 74% cart-abandonment rate on mobile.Lewis:So when people reach that checkout phase and they see   that they need to drop in their credit card number, their   security code, their address, shipping address, zip code, all   that stuff, they wind up ditching it?Priestley:Absolutely. But, PayPal One Touch, they have 87%   conversion rate on mobile. That's incredible. They've had a   lot of people starting to use that. They have added a lot of One   Touch users. And, I think, of their merchants, about one-third   right now are on One Touch. And they just launched this last   year. So there's a huge potential here for them to really   deliver on their promise. They've said they want to make   customers' lives easier, and they're doing that, absolutely.Lewis:Anything else that management provided color on with the   business, and strategically where they're looking,   that investors should know?Priestley:I think the focus is absolutely on mobile. Dan Schulman   has definitely commented on the fact that mobile is the   biggest opportunity for them, and there are a lot of   industry tailwinds that they're experiencing right now.   And I would completely agree. I think Black Friday this   year was the biggest online shopping day in history.   In quarter three last year -- we're still waiting for   quarter four -- the Census Bureau said that online   retail made up 10% of all retail transactions. So you can see   that if they are positioning themselves well to benefit from   this, it should be a rising tide that lifts all boats.Lewis:I know they've talked a little bit in the past   about continuing to be an asset-light business. Is that   something that management recommitted to in the most recent   call?Priestley:Yeah, absolutely. This is something that analysts have   been focusing on. I definitely noticed a couple of questions   about this in the earnings call. Square offers capital, it offers   loans, as part of its services. It's not a huge part of their   business, but it is a risk area of the business. So, in the   fourth quarter, they had $123 million loss on loans. As a service   similar to the company Square, which deals mostly with small   businesses, but obviously this is individuals, PayPal has access   to a lot of people's information and their spending habits and   how much money they have. So they want to really leverage that   information, and offer it out to partners to facilitate the loans   using their information, which takes the risk away from PayPal,   but they're still generating a percentage of income from it. So,   overall, Dan Schulman commented that it's a really   competitive environment for this. I think the payment space   is just getting more and more competitive, every angle of   it. But overall, I think this is definitely a good   move for the company. It's the right decision, it's   going to eliminate some risk. But it's also potentially   going to bring in a degree of revenue too, if they can grow   that segment.Lewis:So, it seems like the general takeaway here is: Wait and see   with a lot of the company's mobile initiatives. The core   business seems to be humming along. There was a little bit   of disappointment, but nothing thesis-altering, nothing   crazy in the report.Priestley:No, absolutely not. And they didn't touch too much   on some of their partners. They've had some really   high-profile partnerships withAlibaba,Vodafonein the U.K. and Europe, and many others;Discover, that they recently announced. They didn't touch on that   too much, so we can't really give investors a good flavor for how   that's going, only that it's in line with   their expectations. So, yeah, I agree with what you   said. I think mobile is going to be a big area of focus,   we'll continue to have a look at those transaction volumes and   customer engagement.Lewis:So Sarah, I said that you did the heavy lifting   on PayPal. I did most of the homework with Alphabet's   earnings. I'm going to flip it over to you and let you host   for the second half of the show.Priestley:It's really nice to not be in the hot   seat. [laughs]Lewis:Yeah. I'll stop firing questions at you. It's my turn.Priestley:So, yeah, Alphabet reported the same time, yesterday   after the bell. What were the results?Lewis:Overall, Alphabet's revenue came in at about $26.1 billion   for Q4, up 22% year over year, which beat analysts' estimates of   $25.3 billion. Earnings per share came in at $7.56, slightly   lower than analysts' projections of $7.63 per share. I think the   real story -- and what caused some of the immediate reaction   for the stock -- was that adjusted profit missed by much more.   That came in at $9.36 a share, versus expectations of $9.64 a   share. We saw, after hours, the stock was down about 2.5% to 3%.   That's what most of the market seemed to really fixate on.Priestley:And what was the cause of that?Lewis:Tax rate, basically, is the short of it. In Q4, Alphabet had an   effective tax rate of 22%. They also highlighted their broad 2016   tax rate, because they're able to report whole fiscal year   results as well. The company's effective tax rate for the year   was 19%. That's a big bump. And you realize that average is also   incorporating other quarters. You can get a sense of how much   more they were paying out in taxes this quarter. Really, if you   want to get down to the   nitty-gritty, MarketWatch writer Jeremy Owen   does a really good job breaking down the specifics,   but the gist of the issue is, the Financial Accounting   Standards Board issued some changes a while back, basically   impacting how companies can treat stock-based compensation   for their adjusted earnings numbers. And that wound up impacting   results for this quarter. Moving forward, the company   will no longer be excluding stock-based compensation   expenses from their non-GAAP results, which should smooth things   out. But they wound up dealing with a little bit of a hiccup this   quarter to reconcile.Priestley:Yeah, that's really unusual, the change for GAAP   there.Lewis:Yeah. Typically, you think of non-GAAP numbers as   being something where the Financial Accounting Standards   Board gives people a decent amount of latitude to operate   how they want to. But they like to rein things in every now   and then, specifically with stock-based compensation because   it's something that a lot of firms use to make their non-GAAP   numbers look quite a bit better than their GAAP numbers,   especially in the tech space. Looking at a couple of the   different segments, their Google segment, which is search,   ads, Android, Maps, Chrome, YouTube, pretty much   anything that falls under their internet properties, came in at   $25.8 billion. So, looking at a company with $26 billion in   quarterly revenue, that's the meat of it right there. That   is generally performing pretty well. Their Google Sites   segment, which is the majority of that, was up 20% year over   year. Network revenue up 7% year over year. Other revenue, which   is a smaller portion a little bit less related to the   internet properties within that segment -- think Hardware,   Google Play, and their cloud segment -- was $3.4 billion, which   was up 62% year over year. So, that's a very fast-growing   segment within Sundar Pichai's Google area of the   business.I think, if you're looking for indicators for them, the   two big ones that tell the story for the ad business and what's   going on with some of the internet properties: Aggregate paid   clicks, which is basically the number of times that people   are interacting with ads online, was up 36% year over year.   Aggregate cost per click, or CPCs, as they're commonly known, was   down 15% year over year. This is not really a surprise. This   is a story that's been playing out for a long time.   We talked about the shift to mobile when we   were talking about PayPal. The same thing is happening with   internet search. CPCs have been driven down because the   effectiveness of mobile ads isn't necessarily quite the same   as it is for desktop. But for the longest time, Google has been   able to make it up on volume. There's actually quite a   parallel there with what happened with PayPal and   the volume making up for the smaller transactions.   We're seeing the same effects here with Alphabet.Priestley:Would you suggest that's something that investors   should include in their thesis going forward?Lewis:I think it's something that, at this point, we shouldn't be   too surprised by. This story has been playing out for a decent   amount of time. If it really accelerates, you might have to   worry. But they have been very good at making the volume   make it work out. Eventually, mobile will need to find a floor   somewhere, and enjoy that. But so long as we're still in   that transition to mobile, I think we're going to   continue to see this for a while, unfortunately.Priestley:OK. What about the Other Bets segment? I know there   have been some interesting moves this year.Lewis:Yeah, this is something that people love to ask about,   because it's like, ""Where is Google wasting all of this   money?"" As a reminder, this is basically all the stuff they do   that isn't tied to their internet properties. Think of it as   their moonshot projects. The big financial contributors for this   segment are Nest, Fiber, and Verily. They tend to focus on a   full-year breakout for the segment because the numbers   are so small relative to the overall business. But revenue   came in at $809 million for 2016, which was up 82% year over   year. Operating loss not including stock-based compensation   was $2.9 billion, down slightly year over year. But,   this segment is still a money pit for Alphabet, and I think   it will continue to be. They have reined in costs a   little bit under CFO Ruth Porat. I think she has forced all of   the Other Bets initiatives to at least be able to show   a path to monetization, or a road map to what that might   look like. But I think there's a certain   test-and-innovate atmosphere that they want to maintain.   And investors have been OK with that, because their core   internet business just prints money for them.Something that is interesting with them and the Other   Bets segment is, they spun out Waymo, which is their   autonomous driving segment. For the longest time, that was   the Google Self-Driving Car Project. A couple months ago, they   said, ""This is a stand-alone business unit, and it will be nested   within the Alphabet holding structure. It will continue to be in   Other Bets."" And we didn't get any financial insight into   what's going on with that. But they talked about it in the call.   Ruth Porat provided some commentary on what   they're basically doing with Waymo as a blueprint for what   they will continue to be doing with Other Bets. Not a ton to   report there, but this is something that Daniel Sparks and   I talked about in a podcast when they announced that a few   months ago. As we, in the next couple quarters, over the   next year, continue to get more information about Waymo, I   think we can look at that specific business segment and see the   path for what's going to be going on for some of the Other   Bets as they continue to mature and eventually see   monetization. So, not a ton to report with Other Bets stuff,   but at least we have something that we can start to track   for what the company's ambitions might be.Priestley:Absolutely. It looks like they're moving forward with   that. Was there anything else in the numbers that stood out   to you in the earnings call?Lewis:I think some of the things that people need to keep in   mind with this report, because the stock was down after   hours, I think as of taping this morning, they were down 40   or 50 basis points, so not a crazy reaction like 3% that we   saw after hours yesterday, but still down, I think   people might be scratching their heads a little bit with some of   the tax stuff they saw. Prior to the report, the company was   trading at all-time highs. It's traded up for a while. I   think it's somewhere in the teens in the last year or so. So,   there's that. And also, Alphabet does not provide   detailed quarterly guidance. Most companies do offer up   that guidance, and analysts create their own models based on   those numbers, those line items, and they have their puts   and takes to tweak it slightly. But because Alphabet doesn't   give those baseline expectations, the likelihood of   actual numbers being different than analysts expectations   is slightly higher than it would be for other   companies. So, the market's reaction is always, I think,   generally going to be a little bit sharper than what we   might see for a company that does offer standard   guidance.Priestley:Yeah, because they have nothing ready to peg   their estimates to.Lewis:Yeah. They have the general trend of things and what   they can glean from commentary. But very often, you'll   see analysts' expectations more or less mirror guidance   with slight adjustments. Not having that as a   crutch can just add some unpredictability to things. I think   that's the way you have to think about it.Priestley:Any other little gems?Lewis:Outside of the numbers, something that caught my eye that I   think is a great point, and really underscores the   importance of reading company conference calls, and not   just relying on the numbers that you see reported and the   quick earnings takes you'll see online: Mark Mahaney   from RBC Capital Marketsin the Q&A section of the call asked this really   great question, and I think it points to a looming risk   for Alphabet, and I just want to highlight that for   listeners. He said, ""It looks to me like Google devices are   being outsold 10 to 1 or something like that in most homes.   It's immaterial now, but you could see you in five   years there's a new voice search interaction   interface and it's not Google in the home. That could   be a real challenge for the company."" And he was basically   positing, ""What are you guys doing about all of the   virtual-assistant and smart-home devices?""Priestley:Yeah, great question.Lewis:Yeah. And Sundar Pichai, Google CEO, he gave that   generally positive answer, talking about the investments the   company is making and how they're working toward voice   search, and how they're trying to meet consumers in every   situation that they might be using voice search, whether it   be phones, TV, homes, cars, whatever. But really, at its core,   Mahaney's question is getting at this idea of: Amazon's   Echo devices are selling like hotcakes. If the installed   base for them, or really any other virtual assistant,   gets massive, and consumers start using those   devices for the types of things and the purposes   that people are generally using Google mobile   and desktop search for, what does that do for your   business? I don't want to be alarmist with any of this. I am an   Alphabet shareholder, I really love the company. But I think   he makes a good point. Earlier this month, actually, at an ad   industry conference, there was anAmazonVP talking about some of the capabilities and   some of the opportunities that Amazon might explore. That   led some analysts to speculate that the company might   be interested in exploring paid search with its Alexa product.   This is not something that is a next-quarter, next-year issue.   But over the next five to 10 years, we need to keep an eye   on how people are using search, and how people are using   home assistants or virtual assistants. Because, if we   see that slowly eat into what would otherwise be desktop or   mobile search, you have to wonder about how that   might impact Google's core business, and really what   prints money for them and allows them to fund all of these   other projects.Priestley:Yeah. And also, which products they're using.   If everybody starts adopting the Google Nest, then they're   good.Lewis:Yeah. If people are using Nest or Google Assistant, then   yeah, not a huge problem, that will keep them within that   ecosystem. If they are using products that don't lean   on Google search, and you have platforms that are able   to monetize that search, Google might get crowded out a   little bit. Again, Google did $26 billion in revenue this   quarter. The vast majority of that was online ads. It's a   huge market. I think people's more in-depth searching, or more   research-based stuff, is always going to be on desktop or   mobile. You can only glean so much from audio. But if you   want the quick answer on something -- say you want to know   who was the fifth president of the United States -- you can   find that out with a voice search, and not really have to   worry about being on mobile or desktop. And that's less   impressions for Google Ad Search. So, it's something to keep   in mind. Again, this is a five, 10-year risk. But,   just, investors, keep an eye on what's going on with   the virtual assistant market, because it's something that   could impact Alphabet down the road.Priestley:That's really interesting. I will hand the baton back   to you. [laughs]Lewis:Oh, you're going to let me wrap up? That's so   magnanimous of you.Well, listeners, that does it for this episode ofIndustry Focus.

Take Tesla Inc (TSLA) Profits, Pour Them Into Twitter Inc (TWTR);2/14/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) andTwitter Inc(NYSE:TWTR) are both momentum (or momo) stocks. Usually these are fast-running stocks where most of the buying and selling is done on faith rather than science. That means conviction is based more on speculation, and not so much valuation.makeArticleAd();Source:WEnet Studio Via Stock SnapBefore you send out the posse to get me for calling TSLA or TWTR stock speculative, let me explain what I mean.WhenApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) fell to $90 per share, I went long with conviction based on pure valuation versus price math. Price fell to a level where Apple shares were a slam-dunk buy based on income, cash and stock price.Compare this with any long trade I've done on TSLA stock. My thesis has never been about valuation. Around $200 per share, I sold puts in Tesla expecting that buyers would step in to support the stock. At $225 and $255 per share, I wrote about going long based on pure technical breakouts.Just last week, I wrote about theopportunity to profit from TSLA stock even if it stalled. Over $3 in profits came fast. So I need to roll out of those profits and find another place where risk is less obvious.My portfolio almost always has a small portion reserved to speculative trades. As I close my spec trade on Tesla stock, I want to roll the risk into a bet on TWTR shares.5 Income Tax Deductions You Can't Afford to MissWhy Twitter? Especially when I've been so vocal about their management's incompetence?Last week, Wall Street negatively reacted to Twitter's earnings report in a violent manner. TWTR stock fell 15% in a matter of hours. But what got my attention more so than Twitter falling off the cliff was the high number of downgrades to ""sell"" from the analysts. This sounded like capitulation in coverage, where almost everyone gave up on the idea of higher prices soon. If I am correct, then this greatly reduces the number of incremental sellers.This would also give me levels against which I can sell risk.How to Trade TWTR Stock HereThe first bet:Sell the TWTR Jan 2018 $13 put for $1.40 per contract to open. By selling naked puts, I am committing to owning Twitter stock at $13 per share if it falls beneath it. My breakeven point would be $11.60 per share, and anything below it would then accrue losses for me. This trade has a 15% buffer from current price and a 70% theoretical chance of success.TWTR stock would have to repeat the drop from last week and set a new all-time low for me to start losing money. Nevertheless, I could modify this trade to being a credit put spread, thereby greatly reducing the worst-case scenario.The alternate bet:Sell the TWTR Jan 2018 $13/$10 credit put spread, but for only 85 cents per contract. That said, in this structure, my max risk is defined to the width of the spread less what I collect to open the trade.Both trades have the same odds of success.Run With the Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Bulls NowSomeone who is optimistic about a buyout could use some of the premium to buy calls, but this is not for me. While I do believe that there could be support here, I have zero faith that TWTR management could pull off a miracle.I am not required to hold these trades open through expiration.

Exploiting The Amateur Investor's Edge: Investing In What You Know To Discover Bargains And Earn Conservative, Outsized Returns;2/14/2017;"ByMichael Seeley:""Buying what you know about is a very sophisticated strategy that many professionals have neglected to put into practice.""[i]- Peter LynchThe author isn't sure just how descriptive the above statement is when applied to institutional money managers and investment analysts today. The ones we have spoken to seem to have a very detailed understanding of all the companies and industries they cover. The author does believe it accurately describes the average individual stockpicker.makeArticleAd();IntroductionInvesting, as practiced by the average investor, is a game rigged so the housealmostalways wins. Wall Street will take the average investor's life savings, and will do so dispassionately and unapologetically. This fundamental understanding is essential to engaging in buying and selling activity in the market.""Investing is a zero-sum game. To buy a stock, someone else has to be selling.You are betting you know the company better than the person that is selling it to you.""[ii]- Peter LynchMake no mistake about it, buying and selling stocks is a competition. It is serious, it is real, and if one is not constantly aware of this fact and doesn't take it seriously, one is apt to be a sucker. Someone is always trying to either sell someone else an overpriced security, or they are trying to buy another person's underpriced security for pennies on the dollar. That is what the market often is,[iii]an exchange to take advantage of the person on the other end of a transaction. This reality is not always appreciated, as one's competitor is rarely seen, but it is a competition all the same, and one with real financial stakes. Every single time you buy or sell a stock, there is somebody on the other side of that transaction betting you are wrong, and they are betting real money on it. They are also betting they know more than you, and they are trying to exploit your ignorance in the business underlying the security.""There are rich teams, and there are poor teams, and then there's fifty feet of crap, and then there is us."" - Brad Pitt's character Billy Beane in Michael Lewis'Moneyball,speaking of the Oakland AthleticsWhat's more, the game most institutional money managers and Wall Street institutions play is stacked heavily intheirfavor. They have more resources than the amateur investor, better industry coverage, better contacts, better access to management teams, better technology, brilliant (and let's face it,moreintelligent) analysts with more prestigious post graduate and doctoral degrees from the finest institutions in the country. Playing a game even remotely in this machine's wheelhouse is almost certain to be a disaster. The chances are that those institutions are generally on the other side of every transaction the amateur investor enters into.If the reader is not yet discouraged, he or sheshouldbe. Forgetting the above facts and becoming complacent, or even arrogant, will not lend the sense of humility and caution that are necessary for successful stock picking. A measure ofarroganceis necessary in picking stocks, but it must always be balanced with humility and awareness, and it is good only when logically supported by research and analysis. All of this brings us to a harsh truth that the reader will be wise to remember.""Choosing individual stocks without any idea of what you're looking for is like running through a dynamite factory with a burning match. You may live, but you're still an idiot.""[iv]- Joel GreenblattIf we accept Mr. Greenblatt's statement as true, and the author is a firm believer it is true, then why even try to buy and sell individual securities?Well, the real truth is that buying and selling individual stocks is generally only stupid if one engages in the practice in the way almost everybody always does. Put another way, there is a right way, and then there is the way nearly everyone does it.The right way is the exception.Despite all the above, the amateur may still achieve results in excess of the majority of the professionalsifthe amateur insists on playing his or her own game on his or her own field. To make money consistently over the long term, the investor needs toonlybet when the odds are in his or her favor; in other words, only when he or she has anedgeover the competition.How do we do that? The author will answer the question by posing a few questions of his own:Wouldn't it be nice if undervalued companies that are profitable, with durable competitive advantages and reliable earnings streams, companies that may even be likely to compound over time had like a flashing light and loud noise going off to attract our attention, but only our attention (meaning most of the competition would miss the signs)?Wouldn't it be nice if we could take the thing we are best at, that we know the most about, and we could place bets on that, and even then could choose to only bet when we were certain, or nearly certain that we will win?What we will do in this particular article is to identify a specific ""edge"" that provides most investors a leg up over the large financial institutions and over the army of financial analysts on Wall Street. An edge is a place where the odds are stacked in your favor, through practice, knowledge, skill, time frame, or location. We will also provide real world examples on how to exploit these edges, but first, please permit us an analogy, to really drive the concepts home into the reader's grey matter.Selecting Your Opponent…I cannot help but remember my friend from London, in what is known as theEast End. Mr. McDonald-Smith is a fairly large man of Jamaican descent, speaks fluent Spanish due to a couple of years living in the Dominican Republic, and is, as they say in England, quite fit. You know the type, someone with arms the size of their head where even an extra-large shirt is in constant danger of popping its buttons? Mr. McDonald-Smith can honestly boast that he has never been beaten in arm-wrestling. This feat is not overly surprising when looking at him, but how is it possible that one can have a100%success rate in anything? Surely, there is always someone stronger, or more skilled, and even if there were no such person; doesn't everybody just have a bad day once in a while? In fact, Mr. McDonald-Smith is not an undefeated arm-wrestler because he is the strongest man in the world, nor is he undefeated because he is the world's most skilled practitioner of the sport. No, the fact is that Mr. McDonald-Smith is undefeated due to a very simple strategy that is designed to help him be successful.What is his secret? It is quite simple.He never engages in a match with anybody that he isn't absolutely certain he can beat.In such a manner, he can honestly say he has never been outmatched. He never has, and so long as he continues in his strategy, he never will be. As he grows older, he will undoubtedly accept fewer and fewer challengers until one day he will retire completely from this activity, undefeated and triumphant. Why is this important? Well, Mr. McDonald-Smith has an edge in arm-wrestling. He is large of stature. He is strong. He is fit. He is smart. And he manages his ego. Taken as a percentage, the probabilities of encountering a formidable opponent are quite small. On the rare occasion that he meets such an opponent, Mr. McDonald-Smith graciously declines the match.Now, here's the key to the strategy: It wouldn't work in a formal arm-wrestling tournament where one was forced to take on every opponent placed in front of him.In fact, it may be quite useless. While Mr. McDonald-Smith is likely to do quite well in a tournament, and he may even advance to the later rounds, he is unlikely to win simply because there is always someone stronger, or who has trained longer and more diligently. Luckily for Mr. McDonald-Smith, he needn't ever enter such a tournament. There is no reason to outside of ego.What is the point? Don't play if (and when) you can't win.Examples of Utilizing One's EdgeNow for some real-world examples to illustrate the value of investing in what you know, and using one's individual knowledge and skills to avoid losing money, and to achieve out-sized investment returns. As the author is trained as a tax CPA, these particular examples revolve around corporate income taxes. One needn't understand GAAP accounting for income taxes in order to understand the underlying point (If the author had been a used car salesman, we likely would have made some investments in car manufacturers or rental car companies (one could have made a lot of money investing in Budget, Avis, Hertz, Dollar, etc. if they understood the business). The point is to invest in what one knows and understands).It does not take many home runs and grand slams to result in a satisfactory investment record if one does not lose money in the process. This bears repeating, with emphasis. It does not take many home runs and grand slams to result in a satisfactory investment recordif one does not lose money in the process. That's not to say we try to swing for the fences. Most investors equate swinging for the fences with risk, but that is not the only way to hit a home run. When a perfect pitch comes along, a well-rehearsed swing can result in the ball just flying off the bat with ease. Likewise, sometimes, the most conservative investments can produce the most significant results; particularly if one understands the space and can recognize the opportunities and the risks. This also bears repeating. Sometimes the most conservative investments can produce the most significant results; particularly if one understands the space and can recognize the opportunities and the risks.Vonage(NYSE:VG) andSpectrum Brand Holdings(NYSE:SPB) are both examples of the author finding signals in financial statements to reveal attractive investment opportunities. In both cases, our attention was drawn by the inclusion of atypical effective tax rates in the respective company's SEC filings. Because of our experience with accounting for income tax provisions in our day job, we were able to quickly identify and interpret these signals despite working fairly hectic schedules, and after a review of the rest of the financial statements and the companies' business operations, market positioning, management, and outlook, were able to open an investment in a fairly timely manner, which turned out to be key, as the shares appreciated substantially post purchase.VonageStock High: $7.88 (01/13/2017)Recent Price: $6.88 (02/03/2017)Price Paid: $2.31; $1.71; $2.25 (01/24/2012; 5/25/12; 4/2/12)Vonage Holdings Corp.is an example of how experience in financial statement preparation, specifically the accounting for income taxes can lead one to a compelling investment thesis.VG is a voice-over IP ((VOIP)) communications company (i.e. an Internet-based telephone provider) with catchy television advertising spots featuring either someone on the beach getting hit in the head with a flying box with the Vonage brand on it, or with various personalities declaring their independence from land lines by stating ""this is my last phone bill"" and then crumpling it up and tossing it into a massive pile in the middle of a warehouse, suggesting that everyone is doing it. It was a trendy IPO that promptly plummeted and lost 80% of its market value. Having, for years during college, used AOL's (AOL) dial-up Internet CDs that came free in the mail to access the Internet, we appreciated how the bargain basement telephone service that Vonage provided could be attractive to low-income users, particularly those with non-resident family and friends. Having also been an early fan of Google's (GOOG) (GOOGL) Gmail chat and calling features (now called Hangouts), we and our work colleagues were already adopters of the technology. We recognized that, much like AOL's dial-up CDs had previously, land-based telephone lines were fast going obsolete. The Company had paid down approximately $130M in debt, bringing its leverage to about 0.5x net income, and reducing its interest expense year over year by 2/3. The Company had a fairly clean balance sheet, stable revenue, new apps and overseas partnerships, so good news on the horizon. Add to that a swing to significant profitability, and the Company was trading at a PE of less than 5x and an EV/EBITDA of 3-4x. The Company looked cheap on those metrics alone, and there were no signs that business would deteriorate any time soon.So where did our edge come in? What drew our attention to Vonage was the published effective tax rate ((ETR)). For calendar 2011 the ETR was a -375%, as in abenefit(another word for a tax gain, the recognition of which actually increases net income rather than decreases it) and not an expense. Now, in some situations, ETRs can be misleading, particularly when companies are operating near break-even, but Vonage was profitable in 2011 with pre-tax earnings of $86.3M. It pays to take a look at the footnotes and tax rate reconciliation in such situations to see what is driving the tax benefit.We reproduce the Company's tax rate reconciliation below from its 2011 Form 10-K:[v]Here we see that it was the release of a valuation allowance ((VA)) on the deferred tax assets (DTAs) that was driving the tax benefit (A valuation allowance is a fancy way of saying that an asset can't be recognized because it is uncertain if it will ever provide a benefit to the Company). By removing a VA, the Company is sending a signal that the benefit of the assets will be recognized, and the independent auditors must agree that such a position is reasonable. The next step then is to determine what deferred tax assets the Company is now benefiting from.Again from the 2011 Form 10-K:""Our net deferred tax assets primarily consist of net operating loss carry forwards (""NOLs""). We are required to record a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets if we conclude that it is more likely than not that taxable income generated in the future will be insufficient to utilize the future income tax benefit from our net deferred tax assets (namely, the NOLs), prior to expiration. We periodically review this conclusion, which requires significant management judgment. Until the fourth quarter of 2011, we recorded a valuation allowance fully against our net deferred tax assets.In 2011, we completed our first full year of taxable income and completed our budgetary process for periods subsequent to 2011, which anticipates continued taxable income in the future.""[vi](Emphasisadded)To interject some commentary here, what this means is that, by the fourth quarter of 2011, the Company had not only just demonstrated a pattern of profitability, but it was projecting profitability in the futureat leastsufficient to recognize the NOLs as DTAs without an offsetting VA. So now we know the Company expects to continue its pattern ofsignificantprofitability, and will largely be able to avoid paying taxes during the lifetime of the NOLs. But what exactly does that mean? Let's continue, and remember that the below numbers are shown in thousands (000s), so for example, $300,000 is really $300million.""Based upon these factors and our sustained profitable operating performance over the past three years excluding certain losses associated with our prior convertible notes and our December 2010 debt refinancing, our evaluation determined that the benefit resulting from our net deferred tax assets (namely, the NOLs),are likely to be realized prior to their expiration. Accordingly, we released the related valuation allowance against our United States federal and Canada net deferred tax assets, anda portionof the allowance against our state net deferred taxassetsas certain NOLs may expire prior to utilization due to shorter utilization periods in certain states, resulting in a one-time non-cash income tax benefit of $325,601 and a corresponding net deferred tax asset of $325,601 in the fourth quarter of 2011.""[vii](Emphasisadded)Accountants and attorneys love using run-on sentences. The $325Mbenefitthey are talking about recognizing now that they are removing the VA is not how much income the NOLs are expected to offset, rather, it is thetax effected(think cash tax savings impact) amount of U.S./Canada taxes that will not have to be paid in the future. Thegrossamount of income the NOLs can offset is shown below:""As of December 31, 2011, we had NOLs for United States federal and state tax purposes of $794,714 and $423,963, respectively…""[viii]One can see this activity occurring on both the balance sheet and the income statement. A quick review of the NOL expiration schedule in the tax footnote provides additional insight into theminimumprojected profitability of the Company over the next 18 years.So what did our quick check of the footnotes in the SEC filings yield? Not insignificantly, we discovered that the $326M taxbenefitin calendar 2011 was due to the release of a valuation allowance on $885M of Federal net operating losses (NOLs) booked as an asset on the balance sheet. What this means, in essence, is that the Company was not only demonstrating an impressive return to profitability in the prior year (2011), but that it also had significant expectations of profitability into the foreseeable future. Generally speaking, independent auditors are reluctant to sign off on such a large tax benefit/VA release without compelling income projections and a solid history of recent earnings that are more than sufficient to offset the NOLs. We have seen exceptions to this of course, but provided the auditor is reputable, those exceptions are few and far between.Bottom line; all else being equal, when a company with a $400M market capitalization and enterprise value recognizes a $326M GAAP gain due to the more-likely-than-not expectation ofat least$885M of taxable income over the coming years, and then add to that the PE and EV/EBITDA under 5x and very little leverage, it's a good bet that company is worth a whole lot more than the current $2/share.It also may provide a competitive advantage over new market entrants that must pay taxes over the coming decade.The cash that would otherwise go to pay taxes may be used to amortize debt, invest in the business, repurchase shares, pay a dividend, or any number of activities management may think of to create value and increase earnings further.With the Company's stock trading around $2 per share, and armed with the confidence provided by our edge in financial statement analysis (with particular focus on the income tax provision), and further armed with a sufficient understanding of the business in which it operates, we felt safe entering a position. The results were satisfactory, as illustrated in the share price chart below. Although the shares dipped not insignificantly immediately after our purchase, we took the opportunity to increase our position (remember, we could act with confidence because we understood what we owned, and what the Company and the auditors believed the future held). The shares doubled within the year, and have trended upwards since.LessonsWhen a company's shares are trading at an aggregate market capitalization of under $400M, is not heavily levered, and then that same company recognizes over $100M of annual EBITDA, $86M of pre-tax income, and on top of all that, books a $326M deferred tax asset for NOLs, that is a good sign that not only is the company expecting to earn income equivalent to the gross underlying NOLs prior to expiration, but also coupled with a clean balance sheet and sufficient cash that the company is worth looking at more closely.Spectrum Brand Holdings was in many ways the opposite of Vonage, but our attention was attracted for much the same reasons.Spectrum Brand HoldingsRecent Price: $132.76 (02/03/2017)Price Paid: $25.07 (10/19/11)""Decisions to buy and sell stocks should be based solely on the investment merits"" - Joel GreenblattSpectrum Brand Holdings owns a number of household brand names, including Rayovac Batteries, Black & Decker, Russell Hobbs, Black Flag, George Foreman Grills, Spectracide, Cutter, Repel, Armor All, STP, etc. SPB's debt-financed, acquisition spree in the 2000s resulted in a bankruptcy filing that wiped out shareholders in 2009. One can read more about the Company's backgroundhere.[ix]The Company was still recovering the following two years, when in 2011 we noticed the effective tax rate. We only even saw that as we were looking up Prestige Brands Holdings (NYSE:PBH) and mistyped the ticker symbol. Incidentally, we ended up entering positions in both companies (better lucky than good).""Our effective tax rate on income from continuing operations is approximately 24% and 249% for the Fiscal 2011 Quarter and Fiscal 2011 Nine Months, respectively.""[x]The impact to the tax rate reconciliation for the quarter was even more pronounced, in the event that a 249% effective tax rate wasn't enough to raise eyebrows.Thus, whereas Vonage had recognized a large taxbenefitdue to theliftingof a valuation allowance, Spectrum was recognizing a large taxexpense.This is generallynotgood. The question of course was why? Were earnings deteriorating? Was it merely do to a change in control? Were there not sufficient income projections going forward to offset NOLs? Reading further we got more information:""At July 3, 2011, we are estimating that at September 30, 2011 we will have U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $1,156 million and $1,006 million, respectively, which will expire through years ending in 2032, and we will have foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $143 million, which will expire beginning in 2011. Certain of the foreign net operating losses have indefinite carryforward periods. As mentioned above, limitations apply to a substantial portion of the U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards in accordance with IRC Section 382. As such, we estimate that approximately $299 million of our federal and $463 million of our state net operating losses will expire unused.""[xi]That last bit about the §382 limitations really just says that due to one or more changes in control (i.e. ownership transfers of more than 5% of the company, which will generally occur in a Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization) that there is a limit to how much of the NOLs may be used in any given year, irrespective of profitability. For example, if the Company were to earn $1.2B in fiscal 2011 (implausible we know, but we are making an illustration), Spectrum would belimitedto how much of the NOLs could be used to offset that income, and so on, and so forth until the NOLs expired.""The ultimate realization of our deferred tax assets depends on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character in the future and in the appropriate taxing jurisdictions.We establish valuation allowances for deferred tax assets when we estimate it is more likely than not that the tax assets will not be realized.We base these estimates on projections of future income, including tax planning strategies, in certain jurisdictions. Changes in industry conditions and other economic conditions may impact our ability to project future income. ASC 740 requires the establishment of a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In accordance with ASC 740, we periodically assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized and determine if adjustments to the valuation allowance are appropriate.As a result of this assessment, we determined that a full valuation allowance is required against the tax benefit of our net deferred tax assets in the U.S., excluding certain indefinite lived intangibles. In addition, certain other subsidiaries are subject to valuation allowances with respect to certain deferred tax assets. During the Fiscal 2011 Quarter we decreased our valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets by approximately $30 million. Our total valuation allowance, established for the tax benefit of deferred tax assets that may not be realized, was approximately $350 million and $331 million at July 3, 2011 and September 30, 2010, respectively. Of this amount, approximately $339 million and $300 million relates to U.S. net deferred tax assets at July 3, 2011 and September 30, 2010, respectively and approximately $11 million and $31 million relates to foreign net deferred tax assets at July 3, 2011 and September 30, 2010, respectively.""[xii](Emphasisadded)The Company's footnotes for fiscal 2010[xiii]revealed somewhat more detail on the NOLs and their expirations.Therefore, in contrast with Vonage, Spectrum did not anticipate being able to utilize its NOLs prior to expiration, due both to §382 limitations and/or insufficient taxable income against which to offset the NOLs. In addition, the Company was still fairly levered with $1.7B of long-term debt[xiv]on its balance sheet.So why were we interested? Well, we liked the assets and brands, which were consumer goods with respectable, durable competitive advantages. Although not always the market leader (e.g. Rayovac was competing fiercely with Energizer and Duracell on the platform of ""equal or better value at a lower cost""), the value proposition and barriers to entry were considerable. In addition, due to the heavy debt load which required about $200M of annualized interest payments[xv]per year, the income tax provision was skewing the effective tax rate; therefore, net income (and hence the PE ratio) were, if not entirely worthless, not necessarily reflective of the Company's cash generation capabilities, nor the value of the entire business.""Companies that spend money like drunken sailors, especially on acquisitions and real estate, are left with a huge depreciation allowance and a lot of debts to pay off, which gives them a high cash flow/low earnings profile.""[xvi]The truth was the Company had significant operating income[xvii]and was throwing off significant amounts of cash before interest payments and debt amortization.[xviii]The ETR attracted our attention, but upon closer inspection, we became comfortable with the Company's value strategy, its place in the market, the growth in its earnings and cash flow, its ability to service and amortize its debt, and the defensibility of its business. All things considered, we initiated a position and determined to watch the year-end results[xix]closely.SPB was trading in the $25 range prior to our entry. SPB has subsequently traded up to north of $130 per share. In this case, the ETR merely attracted our attention to a compelling investment possibility so we could study it further. It was a couple months later when the Form 10-K came out that we believed we had something really special. The Company had reduced its long-term debt by $180M from $1.72B to $1.54B[xx]and net cash provided by operating activities was $227M.[xxi]It seemed clear to us that the Company could service its debt load, and worst-case scenario could sell off one or more brands to de-lever further, but we didn't expect that would be necessary.Further research into SPB prior to the shares taking off similarly revealed an interesting arbitrage opportunity via the shares ofHarbinger Capital Group(NYSE:HRG), where one could take advantage of the value gap in SPB at the same time as one could take advantage in the value gap in HRG. This is further discussed immediately below, and is really an extension of the same investment.Lessons:""The best stock to buy may be the one you already own.""[xxii]- Peter LynchOne should listen to Peter Lynch and use one's unique edge to capitalize on opportunities in one's circle of competency.One should continue to listen to Warren Buffett and not sell out of a company with great long-term prospects, a durable competitive advantage, and growing earnings, which was purchased at a fair price. Just hold it forever (unless it is a cyclical).""As I study these reports now, I realize that many stocks that I held for a few months I should have held a lot longer. This wouldn't have been unconditional loyalty; it would have been sticking to companies that were getting more and more attractive…. By abandoning these great companies for lesser issues, I became a victim of the all-too-common practice of 'pulling out the flowers and watering the weeds'"" - Peter LynchHarbinger Capital GroupRecent Price: $16.79 (02/02/2017)Price Paid: $4.06; $4.10; $4.01 (12/29/11; 12/29/11; 12/31/2013)In 2010,Harbinger Capital Groupcontrolled Russell Hobbs, and merged it with Spectrum Brands, leaving HRG with a majority stake in SPB. HRG also owned a valuable insurance company. HRG was owned primarily byHarbinger Capital Partners(NYSE:HCP), a hedge fund that made billions betting against subprime mortgages during the credit crisis.HCP and its founder, Philip Falcone, were at the time under indictment by the SEC, which alleged that Falcone had misused fund assets for personal use, and that HCP had engaged in unfair redemption practices, allowing favored investors such as Goldman Sachs to redeem partnership interests, while locking up other investors (Note these allegations were later settled). The indictment had the result of temporarily depressing the shares of HRG, in our view, understandably, but excessively given the nature of holdings and operations in HRG. One may read a little about this arbitrage play in the comments of the above referenced article on Spectrum Brand Holdings, reproduced againhere.[xxiii]One may further read an article on this special situationhere.[xxiv]There was certainly some control risk in this arbitrage play, but during 2011, HRG actually traded at a value that was less than its publicly-traded ownership in SPB, giving a negative value to the insurance company. As SPB was similarly undervalued at the time, an investment in the undervalued HRG was another way to obtain the similarly undervalued shares of SPB at a significant discount to their trading value. This was just one of the odd, short-term arbitrage opportunities that occasionally arise in an otherwise efficient market. We held the position while the arbitrage gap narrowed, and then exited.It is important to note a couple of items. We were not comfortable holding HRG long-term due to the ownership situation. We would have been comfortable holding SPB forever, and SPB has certainly performed better than HRG over the subsequent time period. Sometimes we can be too smart by half, as we then missed out on the subsequent run-up in SPB shares. Thus, it often makes sense to pursue the simplest course. Complexity often equates with risk. The arbitrage play did work, however.Lessons:Sometimes we can be too smart by half, as we then missed out on the subsequent run-up in SPB shares. Thus, it often makes sense to pursue the simplest course.Complexity often equates with risk.Do you start to see how, with a little awareness and knowledge and skill and discipline you can win, most of the time, and you can win big? It just requires a little patience, and a littleuncommon, common sense.It is instructive to note that both examples occurred after the recent bull market was well underway. The Dow had recovered from a low of around 6,000 to 11,000-12,000, and despite not yet recovering its pre-Great Recession level of 14,000, many prognosticators and value investors were opining that the bull market was running out of gas and that values were few and far between. In August and September of 2011, just a few months earlier, the market experienced a slight correction. By investing in what we understood, we were able to find all kinds of bargainsafterour initial purchases during the Great Recession had significantly appreciated, and this was during a period of time when many were fretting the direction of the market and that there were few if any compelling values available. In our own wheelhouse, we were nearly tripping over them in late 2011 and early 2012.If that Didn't Convince You…In 1994, Mr. Peter Lynch of Fidelity Magellan fame said the following aboutedgesduring a lecture at the National Press Club. We are reproducing several paragraphs to drive the point home:""You need an edge to make money, too. People have incredible edges and they throw them away.I'll give you a quick example of, uh, Smith-Kline. This is a stock that had Tagamet. Now you didn't have to buy Smith-Kline when Tagamet was doing clinical trials. You didn't have to buy Smith-Kline when Tagamet was talked about in the New England Journal of Medicine, or the British version, Lancet. You could have bought Smith-Kline a year after Tagamet came out.Let's say your spouse, your mother, your father, your nurse, your druggist. You're writing all these prescriptions. Tagamet was doing an amazing job curing ulcers. And it was a wonderful pill for the company because if you stopped taking it, the ulcers came back. It wasn't a crummy product if you took it for a buck and then it went away. But it was a great product for the company. But you could have bought it two years after the product was on the market and made five-to-six times your money. I mean all the druggists, all the nurses, all the people, I mean millions of people saw this product. And they're out buying oil companies or drilling rigs. It happens.And then three years later or four years later, Glaxo, even a bigger company, this is a huge company, a British company, brought out Zantac which was a better, at that time an improved product, and you could have seen that take market share, do well, and you could have bought Glaxo and tripled your money.So you only need a few stocks in your lifetime. They're in your industry.I think of people, if you'd worked in the auto industry, let's say you're an auto dealer, the last ten years. You would have seen Chrysler come out with the mini-van. If you were a Buick dealer, a Toyota dealer, a Honda dealer… You would have seen Chrysler dealerships packed with people. You could have made ten times your money on Chrysler a year after the minivan came out. Ford introduces the Taurus Sable, the most exceptional line of cars in the last twenty years. Ford went up seven-fold on the Taurus Sable. So if you're a car dealer, you only need to buy a few stocks every decade.When your lifetime's over, you don't need a lot of five-baggers to make a lot of money, starting with ten thousand dollars or five thousand dollars.So in your own industry you're going to see a lot of stocks. And that is what bothers me.There are good stocks out there that are looking for you, and people just aren't listening. They're just not watching it. And people have incredible edges. People have big edges over me.They work in the aluminum industry. They see aluminum inventories coming down six straight months. They see demand improving. And in America today it is hard to get an EPA permit for a bowling alley, never mind an aluminum smelter. So you know when aluminum gets tight you just can't build seven aluminum smelters. So when you see this coming you can say, wait a second, I can make some money.When an industry goes from terrible to mediocre, the stock goes north. When it goes from mediocre to good, the stock goes north. And when it goes from good to terrific the stock goes north.There's lots of ways to make money in your own industry.You can be a supplier in the industry, you can be a customer. It happens in the paper industry, it happens in the steel industry. It doesn't happen every week, but if you're in some field, you'll see a turn, you'll see something in the publishing industry.These things come along and it is just mind boggling, people throw it away.""[xxv](Emphasisadded)The point is that nearly everyone has an edge. If they choose only to play their game in which that edge exists, they are more likely to come out on top. Of course, one must exercise the discipline of investing in one's own circle of competence, and then waiting for their pitch.ConclusionParticipating in the market is like fishing in waters teeming with both fish and sharks. If one just jumps in and tries to swim with the sharks, bad things are likely to result. And while we are on the subject of sharks…The author's spouse enjoys watching the CNBC showShark Tank. Last week, she made the comment that ""Mark Cuban is always 'out'. It has been a long time since he has made a deal."" Although she likely was frustrated by this observation, her comment caught our attention. We did a quick google search for ""Mark Cuban"" and ""investing"" on YouTube, and we found an interview[xxvi]from August 2011. Now, August 2011 was a month in which, after the market had gained maybe 80% since the 2009 great recession lows, the market started gyrating and was threatening to correct, and professional commentators were beginning to throw around the word ""recession"" again. A great many professional money managers believed the market was fairly, or even overly valued, and fear was again beginning to creep into Wall Street. In this interview Mr. Cuban said the following:""Any time there's volatility and any time there's change there's opportunity. Now I say it's great because I've taken a whole different approach to investing than most people.You know, I think buy and hold is a crock of sh--. I think, you know, the idea that you always have to invest your cash is not far behind, and so I've always been of the attitude that unless you really have a commitment to something, just keep your money in cash, knowing that at some point in time, there's going to be a week or two like we've had…""When the interviewer observes there has been a lot of ""stuff"" hitting the fan lately, Mr. Cuban continues:""Exactly the point. That's where the opportunity is. Then when everything starts getting crazy, I call it the world series of investing, you know, that's where you start digging in…You've got all these professional people on the other side of trades.When I started investing in stocks in the early 90's after I sold my first company, you could understand different elements of the market better than the professionals… Today there's so much money in these huge hedge funds, and they have such professional research, and in depth research,there aren't any advantages for the individual traders, and so my approach has always been,unless I know something specific, put it in cash.""(Emphasis added)We might take the creative liberty to amend that last sentence to replace the word ""any"" with the word ""many,"" but the point is largely the same. Most investors significantly underperform the market over the long run, because they invest in things they do not understand, they try to time the market, or they become emotional and jump in and out of securities rather than just staying put and letting the number of bargain purchases and the extent of the bargains in companies dictate how much of their capital is invested. Finally, they throw their edges away and play Wall Street's game. However, by following certain investing principles and by taking deliberate steps, the average investor can play their own game, on their own terms, and come out ahead.The successful, self-directed investor must adopt a proven, viable investment framework, insist on a margin of safety, and only play the game when the odds are stacked in the investor's favor. In other words, the investor must insist upon exploiting his or her edge. If this results in their being in cash, not when market prognosticators are preaching doom and gloom, and not when their emotions are telling them the market is overvalued, but whenthey simply cannot find compelling investment opportunities in their own wheelhouse, then holding cash may be the smartest thing one can do. The averageactive, self-directedinvestor should not be worried about having a significant amount of their portfolio in cash. Seth Klarman of Baupost fame has strung together a 30-odd year track record of significant out-performance, and absolute performance in nearly every year while holding nearly one-half of his fund in cash, on average. It is very difficult to lose one's money in cash. By being cautious and conservative when compelling bargains are not prevalent, and then by insisting on an edge before investing that cash in a security, truly amazing results can occur. This requires patience and discipline, but those are concepts for separate articles.As Peter Lynch has written, it only takes a few five-to-ten-baggers to result in an amazing long-term investment record (provided the investor doesn't make too many stupid mistakes in the meanwhile).""It was huge gains in a few huge positions that led to Magellan's superior results.""[xxvii]- Peter Lynch""I've said before that an amateur who devotes a small amount of study to companies in an industry he or she knows something about can outperform 95 percent of the paid experts who manage the mutual funds, plus have fun doing it.""[xxviii]- Peter LynchIf one is hell-bent on being fully invested at all times, one may conceivably invest the balance of their portfolio in Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) (BRK.B), just don't go investing in stocks in which you do not have an edge, merely because compelling bargains within your wheelhouse are few and far between. We all worked hard to save enough money to invest; in most cases for years, or even decades.

Run With the Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Bulls Now;2/14/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsDid you buy the post-earnings dip inAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL) last month? Since hitting a low near $812 on Feb. 1, GOOGL stock has steadily bounced back, regaining more than 3% of the ground it lost following a poorly received fourth-quarter earnings report.makeArticleAd();But you haven't missed out on the fun. Alphabet stock still has some gas in the tank.Click to EnlargeAlphabet's bounce from the $812 region was not happenstance. The shares were bolstered by support from their rising 50-day moving average, and a wealth of psychological support from the nearby $800 area. Furthermore, GOOGL stock has been in rally mode since mid-2015, gaining some 53% during this time frame.In other words, the post-earnings dip was less about poor quarterly results and more about an excuse to take some profits off the table.However, now that the situation has corrected itself, and Alphabet stock has emerged from an overbought situation, shares should be poised to run higher.If you took mybullish GOOGL recommendation on Jan. 31and got into the March $830/$850 bull call spread, you are likely already at breakeven or sitting on a profit for the trade. What's more, the odds of breaking out above $850 have improved significantly in the past couple of weeks.9 Top Pharmaceutical Stocks to Buy for the DividendsAlternately, if you took the more neutral-to-bullish option and entered the March $800 put sell, you can all but rest easy now that GOOGL stock is headed higher once again.If you missed out on those trades, though, there's still time to get in before Alphabet Inc tops out again.Sentiment for Alphabet remains as bullish as ever, with nearly all of the 48 analysts tracked by Thomson/First Call rating GOOGL stock a ""buy."" Additionally, the 12-month price target has risen over the past month to $990.72, and that bodes well for the shares going forward, as it cuts down on the likelihood of downgrades to ""hold"" over the short-term.As for options traders, a bit of caution has crept into GOOGL options since Alphabet's quarterly report, but this, too, is healthy for the shares. Currently, the March put/call open interest ratio rests at 0.76, up from pre-earnings readings near 0.85.Furthermore, peak March call OI rests well overhead at $900, meaning that Alphabet should see little in the way of potential options-related resistance.March implieds have come down since the end of January, making GOOGL options cheaper. Currently implieds are pricing in a potential move of about 3.3% for Alphabet stock through March expiration. This places the upper bound at $868, while the lower bound lies at $812.2 Trades for GOOGL StockCall Spread:If you missed out on the late January bottom, here's your chance to bet bullish on Alphabet heading into next month. I suggest the March $850/$860 bull call spread.At last check, this spread was offered at $3.57, or $357 per pair of contracts. Breakeven lies at $853.57, while a maximum profit of $6.43, or $643 per pair of contracts, is possible if GOOGL stock closes at or above $860 when March options expire.Don't Count Out Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Stock Just YetPut Sell:If you're still on the fence, or if you a neutral-to-bullish stance is more your style, then the March $800 put sell remains a solid trade that has a good chance of finishing out of the money.At last check, the March $800 put was bid at $3.30, or $330 per contract. The upside to this put sell strategy is that you keep the premium as long as Alphabet stock closes above $800 when these options expire. The downside is that should GOOGL trade below $800 ahead of expiration, you could be assigned 100 shares for each sold put at a cost of $800 per share.As of this writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceHere's Why General Motors Company (GM) Stock Will Drive to $42The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for 2017: The Experts' Picks7 Stocks That Will Drop by 10% or More This QuarterThe postRun With the Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Bulls Nowappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN): Is It Time to Start Worrying?;2/14/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) seems unstoppable. This is also one of the biggest problems for AMZN stock. When everyone is in, there is no upside left. Of the 43 analysts now covering Amazon,33 have it rated as a buyand none have it lower than a hold.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockBut the expectations attached to these recommendations are what should give Amazon bulls pause. Most analysts expect sharp acceleration of earnings this year, far beyond what the company has delivered so far, with estimates as high as $17.43 per share in 2018.AMZN is a company which, until recently, never made any money, instead being obsessed with plowing every dollar it could find into growth opportunities.Even after closing the books on 2016 - net income of $2.371 billion, or $4.90 per share on revenue of $135.987 billion - Amazon's profitability still trails that ofWal-Mart Stores Inc(NYSE:WMT), which earned $3.034 billion, or 98 cents per share, on revenue of $118.790 billion in the October quarter alone.4 Dow Jones Titans That Are Shooting HigherThe super-bullish stance on Amazon stock is based on the idea that, despite its growth, it still has a long way to grow, and that it will soon extract margins the retail industry has never seen.Forget stopping Amazon, though. But, can anyone hope to contain it?Eye-Popping NumbersAt its Feb. 13 opening price just below $832 per share, Amazon stock is selling at 168 times 2016 earnings. Its market cap of $402 billion represents approximately three times its sales, which is an absurd number for a company that is still, at heart, a retailer. Most retail market caps are a fraction of revenue.But of course, the bulls respond,Amazon isn't really a retailer. Indeed, AMZN is the leading cloud provider, a front-runner in artificial intelligence with Alexa, and is the first ""over the top"" video provider to gain Oscar buzz.All elements of its logistics are for sale, includingpayments, deliveries andeverything in between.Wherever you look with Amazon, you seeeye-popping numbers. It's not just an American growth story anymore,it's a global one.What Can Slow AmazonAmazon doesn't have to be stopped for AMZN stock to suffer. Any sign of a slowdown could cut its value by half, or perhaps even more.Source:FlickrJeff Bezos has been honest about what could happen. He is worried about""trade and protectionist measures""from the new Administration, and he isfiercely opposedto the Administration's recent orders on immigration.Political risks may have moved Bezos to buya $23 million housein Washington D.C. - and politics costs money. However, thosepolitical risks are not just Americanand they are not just physical. A Balkanization of the Internet - the requirement that local data only be used locally, and that citizens of each country read or see only what leaders want - could prove costly to implement. But, it's already happeningin the world of books.Despite efforts to control costs by owning its own logistics,delivery costs remain a concern.Is it Really Good to Be the King?Amazon may be King, but the crown hangs heavy. AMZN managers know thatcompetitors are catching up in the cloud space,Alphabet Inc.(NASDAQ:GOOGL) is challenging Alexa and has the capital to beat it in the cloud, and Amazon's success with tabletshas the potential to threatenApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL).7 Marvelous Mid-Cap Stocks to Buy for the Best of All WorldsNo tree grows to the sky, and likewise, no business can conquer the whole world of technology, media and retail. Amazon has a host of challengers wherever its managers look, and its ambitions are also facing political resistance.Does this mean I'm selling out of Amazon stock and predicting a crash? No. But, when everyone's telling you to buy something, that's actually when you should start to worry, and I've started to worry about Amazon.Dana Blankenhornis a financial and technology journalist.

3 Internet of Things Stocks You Don't Have to Babysit;2/13/2017;"The technology sector isn't always the best place for   investment stability, nor are new technology trends ever much of   a safe investment. But it doesn't have to be this way. The   Internet of Things (IoT) is ushering in a massive wave of   technological changes -- nearly 50 billion things will be   connected to the IoT by 2020 -- and there are three companies at   the forefront of this $7 trillion market that should remain   steady, long-term investments:Verizon Communications(NYSE: VZ) ,Cisco Systems(NASDAQ: CSCO) , andAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) .Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();Verizon CommunicationsVerizon is stalwart dividend stock that has plenty of   long-term potential in the IoT. The company already   dominates the wireless network space despite cutthroat   competition fromAT&TandT-Mobile, and it's only getting stronger.Verizon is making early investments in 5G networks that should   give the company an edge over its competitors in the IoT network   space, much like the company's early push into 4G kept it ahead   of the competition. Verizon calls 5G the ""foundation for creating   more internet-connected devices"" and says that it will use the   network to bring traffic lights, stop signs, parking meters, and   other city systems online.Over the next few months, the company plans on rolling out   commercial 5G field tests in a few locations. Verizon CEO Lowell   McAdam said at an investor conference in December that he   believes the company is two to three years ahead of the   competition for 5G because of its early tests and the company's   recent purchase of the fiber-optic network company XO   Communications.5G will allow new types of faster-than-ever device   connections, and Verizon's early mover advantage could pay off   down the road.Cisco SystemsCisco is a perfect example of a company that will plug away in   its respective field without offering investors much drama -- and   at the same time provide a nice 3.3% dividend yield to boot.Cisco has been talking about the IoT for quite some time, but   one of biggest moves came early last year when the company   announced it was buying Jasper Technologies for $1.4 billion.Jasper is a cloud-based IoT service platform that allows   enterprise and service customers to ""launch, manage and monetize   IoT services on a global scale."" In short, Jasper allows   companies to bring nearly any device online (think cars or jet   engines) and then manage those connections through its   proprietary software.Jasper brings with it 3,500 enterprise customers from around   the world that have devices running on 27 service providers.   And Cisco said that it will be able to add to Jasper's   services with its own enterprise Wi-Fi, IoT security solutions,   and advanced analytics.With Jasper, Cisco transitions further into the the   software-as-a-service (SaaS) market that brings recurring   revenue, and allows the company to rely a little less on the   traditionally cyclical hardware market.AlphabetAlphabet and its subsidiaries have been extremely aggressive   in the IoT space, and given the company's massive market size and   its quarterly revenues north of  $26 billion, this is   certainly a company investors don't need to babysit.Most of Alphabet's IoT opportunities stem from Google, which   is already a leader in the connected home space with Google Home   and Nest Labs. By having a slew of IoT devices for the home,   along with an embedded smart assistant in Google Home, the   company is helping to lead the way in IoT home connections.But one of Alphabet's biggest IoT pushes right now comes from   a company called Waymo, which wasrecently spun out of Google. Waymo is the product of years of research and real-world   testing of self-driving cars and Google is looking to the company   to now stand on its own and start generating revenue.Waymo has partnered withFiat Chryslerto bring 100 self-driving minivans to to the roadways to begin   testing an autonomous driving service. The company is likely   still years away from bringing in any significant revenue for   Google, but it's clear that under Alphabet's umbrella   self-driving tech is a big part of the company's IoT plans.On top of that, other companies under Alphabet are exploring   IoT possibilities, like usingnanoparticles to find diseasesin the bloodstream, by pairing them to wearable tech devices.Whatever you do, just don't miss this opportunityInvestors looking for steady companies shouldn't overlook themassive opportunities that the IoT has to   offer. Nearly 50 billion things will be connecting the internet in   just a few years and the IoT market has the potential to   transform many aspects of our lives. The three stocks above are   all big tech names that are tapping into the IoT's potential in   their own way, offering investors growth opportunities on top of   stable existing businesses.10 stocks we like better than Verizon     CommunicationsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Alphabet Inc – Is Google Assistant Going Everywhere? (GOOGL);2/13/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAlphabet Inc's(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Pixel Phone holds a significant advantage over third-party Android smartphones. Since its release, Google Assistant - the new AI powered personal assistant - has been a Pixel Phone exclusive. Third-party smartphones remain stuck with the previous generation Google Now. However, Google released an Android ""alpha"" build late last week and the new Android release enables Google Assistant on third-party smartphones.makeArticleAd();Source: GoogleGOOGL's third-party Android smartphone partners have been feeling a little betrayed since the release of the Pixel Phone last fall.Up until then, Google had not been directly competing against them. It developed Android and allowed them to use the operating system on their phones for free - a fair trade off for the hundreds of millions of mobile devices defaulting to revenue-generating Google search. Google did release the Nexus line of smartphones, but they were more of a showcase for Android than an attempt to compete against its partners.The Pixel Phone's Google Assistant AdvantageThe Pixel Phone changed the equation. It was stamped with the Google name for the first time and it was designed to compete head-to-head with the best of the Android smartphones. In another first, a key new Android feature - Google Assistant - was a Pixel Phone exclusive. Google Assistant leverages Alphabet's latest AI technology in a personal digital assistant that goes beyond Google Now, even gaining the ability to participate in two-way conversations.The situation was serious enough to help convince Android smartphone leaderSamsung Electronic Co Ltd(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) that it needed its own personal assistant. Samsung'sBixby is expected to debut on the Galaxy S8.7 Tech Stocks That Are Bucking the DowntrendNew Android Release Spills the Beans: Google Assistant for All?Android Policeexamined a developer ""alpha"" release of Android over the weekend and discovered thatGOOGL may be having a change of heartabout keeping Google Assistant to itself.Its team was able to activate and use Google Assistant on several non-Pixel smartphones, including a Samsung Galaxy Note 5 running Android Marshmallow and a Nexus 6P running Android Nougat.This means that GOOGL is at least experimenting with making Google Assistant available to third-party smartphones in an upcoming new Android release.Where Would This Leave the Pixel Phone?While Google's Pixel Phone has premium design and a very nice camera, its primary advantage over third-party smartphones is the exclusive availability of Google Assistant. Take that away and it's more or less competing on a level footing with the big guns from the likes of Samsung. True, the Pixel Phone is guaranteed Android updates, but that's no different than the Nexus phones.No, Apple Inc. Is Not Releasing the iPhone 8 EarlyWith AI and digital assistants in the spotlight, Google may have decided that having Google Assistant become a standard Android feature is important to maintain its lead overApple Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhones and Siri.I wrote a few days ago about Google's struggle againstAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN)in the smart home. The Amazon Echo and Alexa have taken a huge lead there and Google Assistant on the Google Home speaker and Pixel Phones may not be enough to catch it. If it were to give up its exclusivity and enable Google Assistant on third-party smartphones, GOOGL would suddenly have hundreds of millions of additional devices in play. This would give it far more leverage against Amazon, at the cost of the Pixel Phone competing on a more level playing field.And the company has always marketed the Pixel Phone as being the ""first phone"" with Google Assistant - not the ""only phone"" - leaving the door open for an eventual general roll-out.Of course, at this point we aren't certain that GOOGL will pull the trigger. The new Android release in question is alpha software - that'sbeforebeta. The company may simply be having some developers test Google Assistant compatibility with third-party hardware with no intention of actually opening up the feature. However, hints like the message ""New! You just got the Google Assistant"" suggest that GOOGL is leaning toward ending Pixel Phone exclusivity and rolling out the AI-powered feature as part of a general Android release.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceIs Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Ending the Age of Intel (INTC)?Report: Apple Inc. iPhone 8 Could Cost More Than $1,000 (AAPL)The postAlphabet Inc - Is Google Assistant Going Everywhere?

Facebook Agrees to MRC Audit Following Ad Data Discrepancy;2/13/2017;"makeZacksArticleAd();Facebook Inc.FBrecently agreed to evaluation of its advertising metrics by measurement watchdog Media Rating Council (MRC). This is quite unsurprising in the light of the confessions by the tech giant regarding its miscalculations of ad measurements last year.Last September, Facebook first indentified a ""mistake"" in it ads metrics. The company realized that it had been overstating the average time spent by users on watching videos. The company only took into account the video with views greater than three seconds, excluding the ones with the views of lesser time, thereby leading to greater than actual average view metrics. Following this, in Nov 2016, Facebook revealed that it had found 'discrepancies"" in calculation in four more metrics followed by two more in December.Facebook, Inc. PriceFacebook, Inc. Price|Facebook, Inc. QuoteFacebook had been facing pressure from advertisers and publishers to gain approval from MRC. Further, per media reports, Carolyn Everson, the global marketing solutions' vice president for Facebook has conveyed to the Association of National Advertisers that Facebook will be providing ""granular data"" to third parties like Integral Ad Science and Moat for making it easier for advertisers and publishers to verify data through the third party. Notably, the viewership of Facebook videos and Facebook Live has already been incorporated in Nielsen Holdings PlcNLSNDigital Content Ratings. She also added that the advertisement audits for the company will be ""administered"" by MRC.It is to be noted that Facebook earns the bulk of its revenues (over 90%) from the interactive and engaging platform it provides to advertisers. Advertisements accounted for 97.3% of revenues in 2016. Reportedly, Facebook is testing a new ad platform - mid roll format - whereby publishers will be able to put in ads in a video (which has a minimum duration of 90 seconds) after a user has played it for 20 seconds or more. Facebook might share revenues with publishers in a 45:55 ratio, similar to the pact with Alphabet'sGOOGLYouTube.Therefore, to alleviate the concerns of advertisers and publishers, Facebook has increased third-party verification.Zacks Rank & Stock MovementAt present, Facebook has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Why Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Would Win Big With a Twitter Buyout;2/13/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsData it's what makes the tech world go 'round. And in the case ofAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), it's what drives its profits, cash flows and ultimately the value of its stock. Google has made a name for itself delving into people's lives, running it through an algorithm and selling the output to advertisers. Pretty much everything GOOGL stock does -even controlling your thermostat- has to do with creating this huge base of data for the company to play with.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockAnd its latest, and somewhat secret moves are all about getting its hands another massive pile of people's lives. Google is buying floundering social media networkTwitter Inc(NYSE:TWTR).Well, not entirely. But GOOGL has started picking off pieces of the Twitter corpse. And by snagging some of TWTR's items now, Alphabet could be setting itself up for to buy the whole enchilada later on. In the end, that actually might be a great deal for GOOGL stock investors as its all about the data.GOOGL Snags Developer ToolsTwitter has been a potential buyout candidate basically the second it IPO'd a few years ago. Perhaps even more so now that the social network has struggled to see user growth and profitability. TWTR stock has plunged about 60% since its public offering. But like Google, Twitter is much more than just its namesake service. In this case, it's about app development.For an undisclosed sum, Alphabet hasagreed to buyout Twitter'smain developer project - Fabric.7 Marvelous Mid-Cap Stocks to Buy for the Best of All WorldsFabric provides a software toolkit for development and design of mobile apps. And even though it's part of Twitter, it's not small potatoes. The software is used by more than 580,000 mobile developers includingAlibaba Group Holding Ltd(NASDAQ:BABA) andWal-Mart Stores Inc's(NYSE:WMT) Jet.com.Fabric will be folded into Google's own Firebase mobile developer platform, and its employees will be now part of Alphabet.So why would the company want this stuff and the talent pool? As I said, it's all about data.With the addition of Fabric, GOOGL will own two of the most popular tools for developing mobile apps. Fabric is a favorite stomping ground for app development forApple Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AAPL) iOS software for iPhones/iPads. By having the two under one umbrella, it gives Alphabet an easy inroad to help developers make formerly exclusive iPhone apps available for the mobile web and Google's Android software. You know, where GOOGL stock makes a bulk of its advertising dollars.The second big data kicker comes from the fact that while much of Google's tools are available for free; many developers will buy computing power and storage from the company's cloud service. It's expected that once Fabric is integrated fully, the deal would be the same. Not only does that boost GOOGL's cloud revenues, but it gives it a chance to comb through all the data being produced and potentially mine it for what it is worth.Backend as a service (BaaS) platforms like Fabric and Firebase fit perfectly into Google's ""Here, have it for free, we'll just keep the data"" business model.In the end, the purchase will allow Google to further cement itself as one of the world's biggest mobile app developers and give it a new source of additional revenue.Alphabet Still Wants BluebirdBut what about Twitter's real function - those juicy 140 character tweets and the social network? Even though Google didn't make an offer to buy the firm, the truth is, Twitter proper still makes for an excellent fit for GOOGL stock. Twitter has a hard time data mining and getting advertisers to embrace all those tweets. But for someone like Google, the social media network - and its 300 million users - is pure gold. Advertisers are starting to prefer social media networks and their ability to drill down to specific users.How Twitter Inc (TWTR) Stock Fooled the Suckers AgainThe idea behind Twitter selling off this hobby business was so that it could focus on boosting the main product's user base, remove spam/bots and make it a better product. Buy waiting to buy it later, all the hard clean-up work will be done. And if it is still floundering, it gives Alphabet a chance to buy it on the cheap. And considering that there will be now plenty of former Twitter employees at GOOGL, integrating it later on will be a snap.Bottom Line on GOOGL StockWhile it continues to be a perpetual rumor, Google's latest actions suggest that Twitter will very much be an Alphabet business in the future. The moves to strengthen its one developer base in mobile apps and snag key personal from the social media company is just the first step. It gives plenty of time for Twitter to refocus and reorganize. In the meantime, the additional revenue from Fabric and cloud sales will be certainly welcome.And when Google finally does buy TWTR, it'll be great news for GOOGL stock. That's 300 million more users it can mine for data and potential extract useful info for advertisers. Google is just one step closer to putting the rumors to rest and snagging the social media company.As of this writing, Aaron Levitt did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 Super-Safe Dividend Growth Stocks to Buy Today7 Tech Stocks That Are Bucking the DowntrendThe postWhy Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Would Win Big With a Twitter Buyoutappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Google's Biggest Cloud Customer Just Signed a $1 Billion Deal With Amazon;2/12/2017;"It didn't take long for Google's biggest cloud customer to   split its allegiances. Just a week afterSnap(NYSE: SNAP) announced it signed a $2 billion five-year contract   with theAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) company, it signed a $1 billion   contract with Google's biggest cloud competitor --Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) .Snap will continue to use Google Cloud for the core Snapchat   functionality. The Amazon Web Services contract is for ""redundant   infrastructure support of our business operations,"" according to   Snap'samended S-1filing.The new filing also revealed Snap has been using Amazon for   nearly a year, so not much will change in the near term. But the   way Snap's contract is structured with Amazon, it could be   spending nearly as much on AWS five years from now as it is on   Google Cloud.makeArticleAd();It's worth taking a closer look at Snap's cloud contracts.     Image Source: Snap.A quick look at Snap's cloud contractsYearAmazon spendingGoogle spending2017$50 million$400 million*2018$125 million$400 million*2019$200 million$400 million*2020$275 million$400 million*2021$350 million$400 millionSource: Snap S-1. *Snap has the option to defer up to 15% of   the amount to the subsequent year.Snap uses Google for most of its heavy lifting today. That   might change in five years. While Amazon just provides redundancy   for Snapchat to ensure the app doesn't suffer significant   downtime right now, it could grow into a much bigger partner for   Snap. That's evident by the ramp in minimum obligations.Google still has a big advantage over Amazon. Snap built   Snapchat on Google's Cloud Platform. Transition to another cloud   provider ""would be difficult to implement, and may cause us to   incur significant time and expense,"" it said in its S-1. What's   more, Snap built Snapchat using the tools available on Google,""   some of which do not have an alternative in the market,""   according to its prospectus.But if Snap wants to expand to China, where Google doesn't   operate, it'll have to rework things on another cloud provider,   anyway. Considering the growing size of Snap's cloud spending,   Amazon may be able to offer tools comparable to what it uses on   Google to help facilitate a transition.Google's cloud business is minuscule in comparison to   Amazon's. Snap's $400 million per year contract very likely made   it Google's biggest cloud customer, and now Amazon's going to   steal away a good chunk of its business. That doesn't mean much   for Amazon -- its cloud business brought in $12 billion last year   -- but it means a whole lot to Google.What this means for SnapSnap is now committing $3 billion to cloud services over the   next five years. That's a lot for a company with only $405   million in annual revenue, even one growing as quickly as   Snap.At some point, it would make more sense for Snap to build out   its own infrastructure like other popular internet services.   Building infrastructure is capital intensive, but once it's   built, the company would no longer be as reliant on third parties   to support its flagship app. With Snap locked into contracts for   the next five years, it's unlikely we'll see it go that way   anytime soon, which means continued pressure on its gross   margin.Last year, Snap's cost of revenue exceeded sales. The bulk of   its cost of revenue was attributed to its cloud infrastructure   expenses, which climbed $192 million last year. As such, Snap   posted a negative gross margin, which is crazy for a company that   primarily produces software.By 2021, Snap will be paying at least $750 million for cloud   services. That will make it one of the largest cloud-computing   customers in the world. With that much committed to Google and   Amazon, Snap better get to work on growing its revenue.10 stocks we like better than Snap Inc.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

5 Things We Learned From The Wall Street Journal's Exclusive Report on SpaceX;2/12/2017;"By now you've almost certainly heardthe big news about SpaceX: Last month,The Wall Street Journaluncovered a treasure trove of internal   documentsfrom the company. These documents clearly demonstrate that   SpaceX is neither profitable nor cash flow positive any   longer.It's what you maynothave heard, though, that will really shock you: SpaceX never   planned to earn much profit from launching rockets in the first   place. Instead, SpaceX is placing its faith in a megaproject,   partially backed byAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) , to create a satellite broadband   internet constellation, which will encircle the globe, and (as   theJournalputs it) ""eventually dwarf [SpaceX's] rocket division.""Now, here are five more things you need to know about SpaceX's   secret plan for satellite dominance.makeArticleAd();Look! Up in the sky! It's not a bird or a plane -- it's how     SpaceX hopes to turn profitable. Image source: Getty     Images.1. Tiny satellites, huge profitsWhile most famous today for its rocket launches (and soon to   become famous for launching reused rockets, perhaps as soon as   this month), SpaceX sees rockets as only a small part of its   plans for future profits.According to internal documents dated from 2015, SpaceX hopes   to begin putting aconstellation of 4,425 broadband internet   satellitesinto orbit in 2018, and begin collecting revenue from it as an   internet service provider as early as 2019.2. Moving the needleThat year, revenue from satellites will be minuscule -- a few   hundred million dollars at most, and probably contributing   nothing to profits. Just one year later, however, in 2020, SpaceX   expects to get roughly equal amounts of revenue from rocket   launches and from satellite internet, about $3 billion each.   Profits are expected to leap to $2 billion -- 33% of revenue.3. Blasting offAnd this is just the beginning. SpaceX expects its revenue   from satellite internet to grow by leaps and bounds from 2020 on,   eclipsing revenue from rocket launches in 2021. SpaceX expects   that by 2022, satellite revenue will account for roughly 75% ofallrevenue the company collects, then grow to more than 80% in 2023,   and to 85% or more in 2024 and 2025 -- by which time SpaceX   expects to be regularlylanding astronauts on Mars.4. Planned obsolescence for rocket launches?You might expect that once SpaceX has begun its Mars   colonization project, the company would lose interest in the   workaday business of merely lofting satellites into Earth orbit   -- and you'd be right.SpaceX's rocket launch plans got knocked off track by its twin   SpaceXplosions in 2015 and 2016. But before those plans went   askew, the company had mapped out a surprising future for its   rocket launch program. Starting off from a base of zero launches   in 2011, SpaceX planned to steadily increase the pace of launches   through 2019. SpaceX had 27 launches slated for this year, for   example. That number would grow to 44 launches in 2018, and then   52 in 2019. But in 2020, satellite launch activity would suddenly   reverse course, and fall to just 41 launches.At the same time, SpaceX projects modest increases in launchrevenueeven after 2020. The logical conclusion is that by 2020, what few   rockets SpaceX is still launching will be bigger, and more   expensive, and will carry bigger, more expensive satellites, too   -- just not as many of them.5. A margin explosionSo what does all of this mean for SpaceX stock, and for the   investors who hope to invest ina possible eventual SpaceX IPO?As we explained last week, SpaceX's internal documents show   that even in the best of years, it has been only marginally   profitable, and is not profitable at all at present. Introducing   reusable rocket launches, as the company plans to do this month,   holds the potential to put SpaceX back in the black. But   significant profits -- the kind that can finance the colonization   of Mars -- will depend on the company's successful deployment and   operation of a constellation of broadband internet   satellites.Based on the numbers laid out above, SpaceX appears to be   targeting operating profit margins of 33% once its satellites   begin operating in 2020. Operating profits could total $4 billion   by 2021 (a profit margin of more than 40% on projected revenue of   about $9.5 billion). Margins will top 50% by 2022 -- then soar   into the mid-50s range in 2023, and finally top out at better   than 60% by 2025. At that point, SpaceX expects to be collecting   $36 billion in annual revenue -- almost all of it from satellites   -- and earning roughly $22 billion in operating profit. To put   that final goal in context, $22 billion inprofitis 11 times more than the $1 billion inrevenuethat SpaceX collected in 2014, its best revenue year ever.Logical conclusion:IfSpaceX can bring its broadband satellite internet project to   fruition, SpaceX stock could turn out to be a very profitable   investment. But if you're planning to invest in SpaceX, you need   to do it for the satellite business (which doesn't exist yet),   and not for the rocket launch business that does exist.10 stocks we like better than Alphabet (A     shares)When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

3 Stocks Begging for a Buyout;2/11/2017;"Sometimes mergers are necessary for survival, and at other   times, they simply just make good old-fashioned sense. In either   case, investors lucky enough to own stocks that do get bought out   can turn a nice profit.We reached out to our contributors, and asked them to tell us   what stocks they think could get bought. They settled onTwitter(NYSE:TWTR) ,GoPro(NASDAQ: GPRO) , andMerrimack Pharmaceuticals(NASDAQ: MACK) . Read on to learn if these companies are worth   owning in your portfolio.A stock good enough for a presidentRich Smith(Twitter):Remember how last year, the internets were all a-twitter with   rumors thatWalt Disney-- or maybeGoogle, or perhapssalesforce.com-- was going to buy Twitter? It never actually happened, of   course, but I think it might have happened -- and I think it   stillshouldhappen.makeArticleAd();IMAGE SOURCE: TWITTER.Second only toFacebookin internet mindshare, Twitter is the stock success story that   never quite made it. Twitter went public more than three years   ago at $26 per share, and almost immediately doubled in price   before investors began to notice a ""giant sucking sound,"" which   ultimately pulled down Twitter to its current price of   $18.50.You can blame Twitter's failure on any number of things: a   lack of profits, single-digit revenue growth, or zero growth in   its user base (as of last quarter). At the same time, with 320   million monthly visitors to the site, Twitter remains a force to   be reckoned with on the internet, and will only grow more   important as President Trump uses it as his social-media   trumpet.Other fans of Twitter may tout its usefulness for keeping   abreast of celebrity news, its deals with sports organizations,   or its efforts in live-streaming. But for me, the key is this:   Today, anyone who wants to know what's going on in the White   House, and even anyone who wants toopposewhat's going on in the White House, needs to be on Twitter to   stay informed. This single fact makes Twitter one of the most   important pieces of internet real estate out there today; if the   company's current owners can't figure out how to make a profit   off that, I'm certain there are other internet tycoons who have   the egos to believe that they can do better.Sooner or later, one of those guys is going to buy Twitter.   I'm betting on sooner.Will a buyout send this stock flying?Tim Brugger(GoPro):Now that the Karma drone is back, at least in limited quantities   in the U.S. (for now), some pundits have suggested that GoPro's   future relies on consumers getting back on board now that its   battery-latch issue has been resolved.Unfortunately, it's not quite as simple as that. As founder   and CEO Nicholas Woodman noted in GoPro's recently announced   fourth-quarter and 2016 annual results, its HERO5 Black camera   was the best-selling digital ""imaging device"" in the country,   along with select international markets, last quarter. And   GoPro's mobile efforts, which include its Quik app, are picking   up steam. But the primary concern remains: GoPro simply doesn't   have the product diversification it needs to weather an   unexpected storm.Woodman warned investors to not expect much in GoPro's fourth   quarter, and the reason behind his trying to mute expectations is   why GoPro is begging for a buyout. The problems started with the   aforementioned Karma being recalled ahead of the all-important   holiday shopping season, along with some manufacturing hiccups.   When one product miscue causes the poor results GoPro announced   on Feb. 2, on the heels of an equally disappointing third quarter   -- in which its revenue of $540.6 million was woefully short of   the $574.5 million expected -- it's a scary proposition.However, a buyout by a company that could add GoPro's camera   and drone to an already diversified product lineup: Nowthatwould make sense. And the timing couldn't be better for a suitor,   given GoPro's woeful 18% stock-price decline over the past   year.It's unlikely, but it could still happenTodd Campbell(Merrimack Pharmaceuticals):Instead of buying Merrimack Pharmaceuticals lock, stock, and   barrel,Ipsen(NASDAQOTH: IPSEY) bought Merrimack's only FDA-approved drug.   Ipsen's apparent unwillingness to acquire Merrimack outright   casts doubt that any suitor will emerge for the company,   especially now that it's sold its only commercial drug. But an   acquisition is still possible.Weighed down by a heavy debt load and commercialization   expenses associated with its pancreatic cancer drug Onivyde,   Merrimack announced a massive layoff last fall. The layoff gave   the company some wiggle room, but it wasn't enough, so the board   cut a deal to sell Onivyde to Ipsen for $575 million up front,   plus promises of up to $450 million in milestone payments.The company plans to return $200 million of the up-front money   to investors as a special dividend, and plans to retire $175   million in long-term debt. Management will also invest $125   million of the windfall back into its clinical-stage drug   pipeline.This deal gives Merrimack Pharmaceuticals a cash runway that   stretches into 2019; hopefully, that will be enough time for   management to prove that the remaining drugs in its pipeline are   worthwhile. Those drugs include MM-121, which is being evaluated   in non-small cell lung cancer, MM-141, which is being studied in   metastatic pancreatic cancer, and MM-310, a preclinical drug   that's expected to enter phase 1 trials this year.Undeniably, the company will be in better financial shape than   it's been in years, once this deal closes. But trial uncertainty   and ongoing expenses could make Merrimack Pharmaceuticals open to   entertaining offers from a suitor. If not, it might at least be   willing to cozy up with a deep-pocketed biopharma on one or more   of its remaining drugs.10 stocks we like better than Merrimack     PharmaceuticalsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

3 Top Stocks You've Been Overlooking;2/11/2017;"As much attention as stocks and investing get on an everyday   basis, there are loads of great companies that still manage to   fly under-the-radar. Whether it's because they are a small fish   in a big pond, a company without a lot of visibility for the   average consumer, or because they provide services that few of us   use, many of these low key stocks deserve a closer look.So we asked three of our contributors to each highlight a   stock that gets overlooked by everyday investors but should be on   their radars. Here's why they think that toy-makerHasbro(NASDAQ: HAS) , ratings agencyS&P Global(NYSE: SPGI) , andW.W. Grainger(NYSE: GWW) are stocks investors should be on the lookout   for.Image source: Getty Iamges.makeArticleAd();The toy maker with tight ties to DisneyBeth McKenna(Hasbro): A top stock many individual investors seem to be overlooking is   Hasbro, the toy maker behind such iconic favorites as Nerf,   Play-Doh,Monopoly,and Transformers, and newer hits, such as Pie Face. One   primary reason is likely its size: Hasbro's market cap of $11.9   billion makes it a large cap stock, however, it's a small fry   when it comes to more popular stocks across the market such asDisney($170.8 billion) andCoca-Cola($180.7 billion), also in the consumer goods realm, and Google   parentAlphabet($573.3 billion) andMicrosoft($490.2 billion) in technology.Those of you who are thinking that Hasbro's long-term total   returns relative to more popular stocks are probably a big reason   why it flies under some investors' radars might be surprised to   learn that Hasbro's return over the 10-year period, through Feb.   7, trumps those of all of the stocks of the companies listed   above. Moreover, Hasbro's return crushes that of its prime   competitor,Mattel, over this period.Data byYCharts.Hasbro should remain a top-performing stock. It has, arguably,   the strongest internal brand line-up in the growing toy   industry. Moreover, Hasbro has increasingly close ties toDisney-- and I can't think of a more powerful partner in which to   help it sell its toys. Hasbro has licenses to make and market   games and toys based upon several top Disney properties:Star Wars,Marvel, Disney Descendants, and Disney Princess   and andFrozen.The company snatched the lucrative latter license from   Mattel in 2016.Hasbro continues to fire on all cylinders. It recently   reported fourth-quarter and full-year 2016 results that trounced   analysts' estimates, with year-over-year revenue growing 12.8%   and adjusted earnings per share soaring 27.1% in 2016.Excellent business at an average priceJordan Wathen(S&P Global):S&P Globalis an overlooked cash cow. The company's core businesses of   software and intelligence services (which includes businesses   like Global Market Intelligence and SNL Financial), and corporate   debt ratings (S&P), each make up about 45% of revenue. These   two businesses are wildly profitable. Its ratings business   generated operating margin of 50% in 2016, while market   intelligence generated an adjusted operating profit margin of   34%.But incredibly, neither lead on margin. S&P Global's   smallest business by revenue, S&P Dow Jones Indices,   effectively earns a royalty on index funds and other index   products. That line of business, which makes up about 10% of   revenue, generated a ridiculous operating profit margin of 64%.   In all, more than $1 trillion of investor assets can be found in   an ETF or other index fund that tracks an S&P Global   Index.I believe its three major lines of business likely have a very   long runway of high single-digit revenue and earnings growth, a   reality that doesn't seem baked in to its average   price-to-earnings multiple.A behind-the-scenes business that cranks out huge   returnsTyler Crowe(W. W. Grainger):Companies that work behind the scenes in business get little   attention from investors. The fact that they are not consumer   facing means that they can easily be overlooked. One such company   that gets overlooked is W.W. Grainger. The maintenance, repair,   and operations equipment supplier has been cranking out high   rates of return, steady dividend growth, and consistent share   repurchases for decades, yet rarely is it discussed as one of   those must-own kind of investments.GWW Return on Equity (TTM)data byYCharts.What also makes Grainger a compelling investment today is the   large growth levels it can pull thanks to new sales channels. For   years, Grainger's business mostly dealt with helping with the   procurement process for medium-to-large sized businesses. These   were the kinds of companies that were large enough to merit a   customer support person on Grainger's end for sales. Now that the   company is building out an online sales platform, it can provide   better service to smaller businesses. This new sales channel is   producing 35% annual revenue growth with 50% returns on invested   capital.The one knock on the stock is that it isn't exactly cheap. It   currently trades at an enterprise value to EBITDA ratio of 12.6   times, which is on the high end of its 10 year historical   valuation. Considering the high rates of return it has generated   and its propensity to throw cash back to shareholders with   dividend and buybacks, though, it's a quality stock that may be   worth paying up for.10 stocks we like better than S and P GlobalWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Why Ford is Spending $1 Billion on a Tiny Self-Driving Start-Up;2/10/2017;"Ford Motor Company(NYSE: F) announced on Friday that it is acquiring a majority   stake in artificial-intelligence start-up Argo AI for $1 billion,   to be paid over five years.What is Argo AI?Argo AI is a new company, founded late last year by CEO Bryan   Salesky and COO Peter Rander. Both are big names in self-driving   circles: Salesky was the head of hardware atAlphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Waymo unit (formerly known as   the Google Self-Driving Car Project); Rander was a top engineer   in Uber Technologies' autonomous-vehicle division. Both were   previously at the robotics institute at Carnegie Mellon   University, where they worked on artificial-intelligence (AI)   technology.The plan for Argo AI is to use the founders' expertise in AI   to develop autonomous-vehicle software. The company is   headquartered in Pittsburgh. It's small now, but it expects to   have more than 200 employees by the end of 2017.makeArticleAd();Argo COO Peter Rander (left), Ford CEO Mark Fields, Argo CEO     Brian Salesky, and Ford CTO Raj Nair. Image source: Ford Motor     Company.What Ford said about the dealFord said that Argo AI ""is bringing together some of the most   experienced roboticists and engineers working in autonomy from   inside and outside of Ford."" An existing Ford team that has been   working on what Ford calls its ""virtual driver system,"" the brain   of an autonomous vehicle, will become part of Argo AI.While Ford will continue to develop its self-driving hardware   in-house, it appears that Argo AI will be responsible for much of   the software development. That software could be licensed to   other companies, CEO Mark Fields said, and it's possible that   Argo AI will go public at some point.""The next decade will be defined by the automation of the   automobile, and autonomous vehicles will have as significant an   impact on society as Ford's moving assembly line did 100 years   ago,"" Fields said. ""As Ford expands to be an auto and a mobility   company, we believe that investing in Argo AI will create   significant value for our shareholders by strengthening Ford's   leadership in bringing self-driving vehicles to market in the   near term and by creating technology that could be licensed to   others in the future.""Ford will hold a majority stake in the new company. Fields   wouldn't say exactly what Ford's ownership percentage will be,   but he did say that it was gauged to leave plenty of room to   provide equity compensation to new employees.Ford's global product chief and CTO, Raj Nair, and group vice   president of global strategy, John Casesa, will hold two of the   five seats on Argo AI's board. Salesky and Rander will hold two   more, and the fifth will go to an independent director to be   named later.Investors, take note: Fields said that Argo AI's spending and   results will be consolidated into Ford's automotive financial   results, primarily in the North America region.What this deal is really aboutHere's how I'm thinking about this deal: Ford just hired two   rock stars in AI and autonomous vehicles, put them in charge of   its self-driving software team, and structured the whole thing to   give the team members -- and very importantly, future hires, in a   field in which the competition for talent is fierce -- the upside   of a start-up with lower risk, because Ford's investment has   essentially capitalized the company and Ford will be its first   customer. It's an intriguing idea; it could turn out to be a   brilliant one.During a conference call for analysts and media, Salesky   emphasized that the structure of what he called the   ""collaboration"" between Argo AI and Ford would help recruiting:   New hires (and Ford's existing virtual-driver team) will go to   work for a start-up with significant potential upside, not   (directly, at least) for giant Ford.And while it's a start-up, Ford's involvement means that new   hires can be assured that Argo AI has both solid funding and a   major customer. The combination of relatively low risk with high   potential upside should make for a potent recruiting tool in a   field where the competition for talent has been extremely   fierce.The upshot: An intriguing move to boost Ford's technology   pushFor Ford, this is a way to bring some deep AI expertise into   its self-driving development project, structured in a way that   will help boost its recruiting efforts going forward. Nair said   that he doesn't expect the deal to ""accelerate"" Ford's effort --   he stuck by thepreviously announced 2021 deadlinefor Ford's first mass-produced self-driving vehicle.But there's a clear advantage to putting the team under the   leadership of Salesky and Rander, in a company that offers the   upside of a start-up with less risk than most. We'll have to wait   to learn more about the structure of the deal to evaluate it   fully, but right now it looks like Ford has taken an intriguing   step ahead.10 stocks we like better than FordWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

With Netflix-Sized Dreams, Facebook Hires MTV Executive to Create Original Content;2/10/2017;"Earlier this week, it was discovered that social media giantFacebookFBhas hired-or, really,poached-an executive from MTV to help create original video content.Mina Lefevre, a former MTV executive vice president, will join Facebook as its new head of development. She naturally made the announcement on herFacebook page, saying ""I have always been drawn to the idea of building something and the idea of being part of the team that helps build Facebook's original content ecosystem...well, that just seems like a dream!""At MTV, which is a subsidiary of ViacomVIA, Lefevre was the head of scripted programming, and working on hit shows likeFaking It,Awkward,Finding Carter,Scream,Teen Wolf,Nicole Byer,Mary + Jane,Sweet/Vicious, andThe Shannara Chronicles. At Facebook, she'll be overseeing the development of the site's scripted and unscripted content, as well as working with global creative strategy head Ricky Van Veen, who joined the company last year. Van Veen is also the co-founder of CollegeHumor.It's well-known that Facebook is dedicated to making video a central part of how users experience its site, whether on mobile or desktop. CEO Mark Zuckerberg even said during the company'slast earnings callthat Facebook is beginning to experiment with shorter, episodic videos to push into its News Feed. And, its Facebook Live feature has been a huge success for the company, especially after this past election year.And because of its success, Facebook has had to figure out ways to monetize this new source of revenue. Ms. Lefevre's hiring is both a way for the company to capitalize on this content, as well as keep its users engaged with the site. Creating original content that could compete with the likes of NetflixNFLX, Amazon'sAMZNPrime, and Google'sGOOGLYouTube would allow Facebook to sell ads in a whole new, uncharted area for the tech giant.Interested in the other top stories of the week?

Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Targeting a Triple-Digit Return;2/10/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIt has been a good, but volatile, ride forAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) shareholders in 2017. Now supports are once again firming up both off and on the price chart for GOOGL stock. And for shorter-term investors, a bullishly targeted butterfly is one way to position and capture a nice profit range with limited risk in lieu of owning shares of Alphabet.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockWhen it comes to large-cap tech outfits like Alphabet,political risksranging from China to net neutrality to immigration laws remain a question mark. But waiting on a resolution is like waiting on Godot.It may take a while. As well, those eventual outcomes could always prove beneficial to GOOGL.Of course, there are also the potential political supports, such as cash repatriation and favorable corporate tax cuts, to consider. Not only is passage of such legislation more popular and likely easier to push through Congress, it would certainly be a boon for Alphabet.What's more, GOOGL stock is looking great again after its recent earnings report. Bottom line,earnings missed but growth is back.With its Q4 results, Alphabet proved its business focuses outside the company's bread-and-butter advertising search revenues, are starting to pay-off for the company.10 Super-Safe Dividend Growth Stocks to Buy TodayFor one, mobile search and YouTube both showed strong results and helped with Alphabet's overall ""exceptional"" year-over-year sales growth of 24%.But newer investments are also coming into their own. The company's aggressive shift into hardware such as its Pixel smartphone,AI-enhanced Homeand virtual reality helped Alphabet grow its ""other revenues"" by more than 62% on sales of $3.4 billion.GOOGL Stock Daily ChartAway from Alphabet's overall bullish narrative off the price chart, GOOGL stock is showing technical support for a long stake by investors.Following a fairly stiff post-earnings bout of profit-taking from brief all-time-highs, Alphabet has managed to find support from a Fibonacci zone, key price pivot dating back to last February's high, as well as the intermediate-term, 50-day simple moving average.Looking forward, targeting the post-earnings high of $867 appears logical. At roughly 4% from current prices, but with no overt company-specific catalysts on the immediate horizon to push GOOGL shares aggressively higher, I like the idea of using a targeted long butterfly spread.GOOGL Stock Bullish Call Butterfly SpreadTiming is everything. This is especially true with options strategies as calls and puts are wasting assets. Ourlast discussion on Alphabet optionsis intimately aware of this, as a lower-risk, bullishly placed long butterfly literally expired one day and $1 dollar short of cleaning up.I suppose you could say the last trade got trumped.Nevertheless, in looking at Alphabet's options and given what has been addressed, the GOOGL March $845/$860/$875 is attractive.Hate Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock, But Love This TradeWith GOOGL trading at $833, the out-of-the-money and bullishly placed butterfly is priced for $2.20 per spread, or less than one-third of one percent of the GOOGL stock price. A maximum profit of $12.80 or return approaching 600% would occur if GOOGL rallied by 3.25% over the next month and landed on the sold center strike $860 call at expiration.The desired and very precise outcome for maximizing returns is not a high-probability event by any stretch. However, with its limited risk, profit range from roughly $847 to $873 and maybe the use of a 50% stop loss in the event profit-taking turns into something more ominous, a GOOGL stock butterfly looks well positioned for the situation.Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in any of the securities or their derivatives mentioned in this article.

Hate Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock, But Love This Trade;2/10/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsUnder a month ago, I wrote about howit wasn't too late to create free profitsfromApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) stock. The trade yielded almost $5 in pure profits. I gained $3 from my debit call spread appreciation and $2 from selling the naked put.makeArticleAd();Now Apple stock sits near its all-time highs making it difficult to recommend an entry point. Furthermore, other mega-caps likeAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN),Facebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) orAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG,NASDAQ:GOOGL) have more obvious entry points.So is it too late to set another long trade in AAPL? I don't think so; there is still time to set another trade using options for another potential run of free profits.Fundamentally, Apple stock still is a money printing machine with a rosy intermediate outlook. I have my concerns about its leadership though; I strongly believe that Tim Cook will ruin Apple, but not in the next few months. Meanwhile, and if markets in general don't suffer a sustained correction this year, AAPL should be higher through 2017.7 Marvelous Mid-Cap Stocks to Buy for the Best of All WorldsClick to EnlargeTechnically, AAPL has a few constructive points. First, it made a wide rounding bottom rejecting the last swoon.Also, I think that if Apple stock sets a new high it would invite more frantic buyers who were leery of the potential of another double top.The Trade:Buy the AAPL April debit $135/$140 call spread. This is a bullish trade for which I pay $1.40 per contract to open. If Apple rallies well past my spread, I stand to triple my money. The price I pay to open the trade is the maximum I could lose. Usually I like to lower my exposure. In this case, I want to sell downside risk premium to finance the purchase of my calls or more. It's difficult to do so near all-time-high levels, but not impossible.The Bank:Sell the AAPL Jan 2018 $105 put. This also is a bullish trade for which I collect $3 per contract to open. By selling naked puts I am committing to buying the stock at the strike sold if Apple stock falls below it. But even if that bad scenario unfolds, I would have bought the stock at a 20% discount from today's levels. This trade has a 90% theoretical chance of success.As long as AAPL stock stays above my put sold, any premium I collect from selling my debit call spread can be pure profit. So if price action becomes too bearish, I could sell back the debit call spread for a profit even if the price I get is lower than my entry price.Apple Inc. a 50% Dividend Grower Hiding in Plain Sight (AAPL)I am not required to hold my trades through their expiration dates.

Owners can use Google Assistant on the speaker to answer questions, find music and control a growing number of smart home devices using their voice only.The device is GOOGL's answer to the Amazon Echo. Amazon's Alexa-enabled speaker has been a surprise hit and allowed Amazon to take a big lead in the race to become the smart home hub - despite the distinct disadvantage of lacking a smartphone platform to host its digital assistant.Google has Google Now and the new Google Assistant, whileApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) has Siri. Between them, the two companies have billions of mobile devices in consumers' hands, yet Amazon still managed to leapfrog them with its personal assistant hosted in a speaker, to build an impressive smart home lead.Apple's Siri can control HomeKit-compatible smart home devices using voice commands, and now GOOGL is rolling out asimilar feature for its Google Assistant, Home Control.Home ControlGoogle's new feature for voice control of smart devices isn't actually new.

They can use voice commands on their phone to change the temperature on their Nest Learning Thermostat or turn off the smart lighting in the room they just left.The Battle for the Smart Home Enters a New Phase (Sort of)At the start of this fight to be the company that becomes the hub of the smart home - the one who controls all those smart devices - the smartphone was it.Smartphones ran all the apps that controlled each of the devices and everyone owned one. With smartphones, the battle came down to iOS and Android, Apple and Google.Then Amazon disrupted everything with the Echo and Alexa. With thousands of compatible products and services, consumers have been snapping them up. Amazon sold out of the Echo at Christmas, afterselling nine times moreof the smart speaker than the previous year.Voice control is in. Having to poke buttons on a smartphone is out.Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Finally Fires Back at Apple With Android Wear 2.0However, Apple and Google are not about to cede the smart home to Amazon. GOOGL began its assault on Amazon with the Google Home smart speaker to directly take on the Echo and Alexa. With Home Control, it's bringing voice control of smart devices to the smartphone, leveraging its massive lead over Amazon when it comes to numbers. There may be millions of Alexa-powered homes, but there are billions of people already carrying an Android smartphone.Except, most of those people still won't be able to use Home Control. GOOGL has baked Home Control into Google Assistant, a feature that's been exclusive to its Pixel Phones since they were released last fall. With Google Home and now Home Control, Alphabet clearly has Amazon's number. The question will be whether Amazon gets Alexa into more third-party devices before Google decides to let third-party Android smartphone makers have access to Google Assistant.For GOOGL, the decision comes down to which is more valuable: maintaining a key competitive advantage for its own Pixel Phones, or giving up that Google Assistant and Home Control exclusivity to take a real shot at unseating Amazon in the smart home.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceNo, Apple Inc.

Nvidia (NVDA) Earnings: Why This Q4 Beat Was Really Important;2/10/2017;"Nvidia earnings (Shutterstock photo)It appears the only thing now strong enough to stop Nvidia (NVDA) stock from climbing higher are investors’ expectations. Thanks to the company’s advancements in cutting-edge technologies such as deep learning and artificial intelligence (AI), NVDA shares have soared some 340% over the past year, crushing every important index.As such, the California-based semiconductor giant had lot to prove Thursday. And with top- and bottom-line numbers that cruised by even the most bullish forecasts, Nvidia answered the call. But the shares appear muted, falling as much as 3% in the after-hour session. From my vantage point, this decline, which I consider inconsequential, is victory for Nvidia and its investors. I’ll get back to that in a moment.makeArticleAd();Let’s go though the numbers.In the three months that ended December, Nvidia reported net a income of $655 million, or 99 cents per share. On an adjusted basis, when taking out one-time gains and costs, earnings came to $1.30 per share, which beat consensus estimates by a whopping 30 cents. Fourth quarter revenue also beat, coming in 55% higher year over year to $2.17 billion. The Street was looking for revenue of $2.11 billion.The strong bottom-line beat was driven by record quarterly GAAP gross margin at 60.0%, the company said, while non-GAAP gross margin at 60.2%. When looking back at fiscal 2016, the company broke several of its own records, including full-year revenue of $6.91 billion, which grew 38% from a year ago.""We had a great finish to a record year, with continued strong growth across all our businesses,"" said CEO Jen-Hsun Huang in a statement. ""Our GPU computing platform is enjoying rapid adoption in artificial intelligence, cloud computing, gaming, and autonomous vehicles. Huang also added that Nvidia’s deep learning GPUs (graphical processing units) has made a breakthrough approach to AI, which can now help in early cancer detection, weather prediction and is helping to tackle challenges such as self-driving cars.All told, it is these breakthrough areas that continue to drive interest in NVDA stock. Admittedly, I wasn’t a believer until now. And while the tech battle has always been between Apple (AAPL) Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN) and Facebook (FB), those guys are not alone anymore.In terms of the 3% decline on these solid numbers? Nvidia is being shown the respect it now deserves. Even if the stock were to decline 5% to 10% — after a 340% one-year rise — it would still imply the momentum story is still in place. And Nvidia’s Q1 outlook for revenue to be $1.9 billion, which surpass Wall Street estimates of $1.88 billion, suggests it sees no signs of slowing down."

No, Apple Inc. Is Not Releasing the iPhone 8 Early;2/10/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsA report began circulating several days ago thatApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) may start production of the iPhone 8 early. Typically, when a company starts manufacturing sooner than usual, that points to an accelerated release date for a new product.makeArticleAd();Source: AppleIn this case, it seems unlikely the move will result in an iPhone release date before Apple's standard September launch.If not to get it on shelves sooner, why would the company want to get an early start on new iPhone production?The iPhone 8 Early Production Ramp UpApple has a pretty standard roadmap when it comes to new iPhone releases. With a late September iPhone release date, the company starts to ramp up production of the new model in late summer. However, this year it looks as though Apple may be breaking with tradition.According to a report from BlueFin Research Partners, there are indicators in the company's supply chain that point to an unusually early production ramp up for the iPhone 8. Quoted inMSN Money,the BlueFin report notes:""The most intriguing data points that we have uncovered suggests that Apple is ramping the next generation iPhones earlier than historical norms.""Why Early Production Won't Lead to an Earlier iPhone Release DateBefore anyone gets too excited about the possibility of an early iPhone 8 release, that scenario is highly unlikely.First, ramping up production in June means Apple will begin having stock of the new iPhones in warehouses by the summer. But no one releases a flagship smartphone during the summer months - that's a slow time for consumer technology news. People are on vacation and not only would an iPhone announcement not get the coverage Apple expects for its new product launches, with so many people away the line-ups at Apple Stores the company is hoping for wouldn't happen.3 Warren Buffett Stocks to Buy in the Trump EraAn early release would also reduce iPhone 7 sales. Now that production is humming on that model, Apple wouldn't want to kneecap it by releasing the iPhone 8 early.So Why Would Apple Ramp up iPhone 8 Production Early?It's become increasingly obvious that companies like Apple are pushing the limits of their supply chain and manufacturing partners with their latest smartphones. The new dual camera system, haptic Home button and other components led to a shortage of some iPhone 7 models at launch. Apple ramped up production in late summer as usual,but these issues caused delays.I preordered an iPhone 7 Plus, but still waited a month after the new iPhones went on sale before mine was available …Then there's the issue of batteries. Apple has had to face its own headaches withiPhone 6 and 6s batteries, but those problems pale in comparison to the nightmare rivalSamsung Electronics Co Ltd(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) has gone through with the Galaxy Note 7 and its exploding batteries.There's a lot riding on the iPhone 8 and Apple appears to be throwing all sorts of new features, cutting-edge technology and a completely new design at its 10th anniversary iPhone. Glass construction, wireless charging, an OLED display, virtual Home button and more. The company is even rumored to becharging $1,000-plusfor its new flagship, an unprecedented price for a smartphone.In addition, Samsung will likely be introducing its new Galaxy Note around the same time, and pulling out all the stops to make that phablet such a smash hit that everyone forgets about the Galaxy Note 7.Alphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) is also expected to release the followup to the worryingly successful Google Pixel Phone in the fall.Rather than ramping up for an early launch, it's far more likely that Apple is starting iPhone 8 production early in order to iron out all the manufacturing bugs early. Virtually all of the components will be new and Apple will undoubtedly be pushing the limits of manufacturing capability. Having an early start will ensure any issues are caught well before the iPhone 8 goes on sale, ensuring a smooth, scandal-free, launch. And no embarrassing issues for the competition to take advantage of.The early ramp up also ensures that even if things don't go smoothly at first, there will be plenty of iPhone 8 smartphones sitting in Apple warehouses in September, ensuring a record-setting launch.Should Under Armour Inc (UAA) CEO Kevin Plank Step Aside?Despite the apparent early production ramp up, don't expect an iPhone release date in the summer. But Apple's move does mean you should have a flawless iPhone 8 in your hands at the launch, instead of waiting weeks or months for supply to catch up to demand.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace12 Stocks That Will Live and Die by Donald Trump's Pen7 High-Risk, High-Reward Stocks to Buy NowThe postNo, Apple Inc.

Don't Overlook These 6 Incredible Amazon.com Numbers;2/9/2017;"Shares ofAmazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) fell more than 3% on Feb. 3 after the tech giant   posted mixed fourth quarter earnings and  soft guidance for   the first quarter. Revenue rose 22% annually to $43.7 billion,   but that  missed expectations by $980 million. The company   was hit hard by currency headwinds, which reduced its top line by   about $558 million. Amazon's closely watched AWS (Amazon Web   Services) revenue rose 47% annually to $3.54 billion, but that   also missed expectations of $3.6 billion and represented a   slowdown from 55% growth in the third quarter.For the first quarter, Amazon expects 14.1% to 22.7%   year-over-year sales growth, which missed analyst forecasts for   23.4% growth. But on a currency neutral basis, which excludes an   expected currency impact of $730 million, Amazon expects its   revenue to rise 17% to 25%.Image source: Amazon.makeArticleAd();Some negative reports about Amazon focused on those headline   numbers, but they glossed over many of the positive growth   figures. Let's take a look at six incredible numbers from that   report that investors shouldn't overlook.1. $749 million in net incomeDuring the fourth quarter, Amazon's net income rose 55%   annually to $749 million, or $1.54 per share -- which beat   expectations by $0.19. For the full year, its net income surged   over 300% to $2.4 billion.That incredible growth was mostly attributed to the rapid   growth of AWS' high-margin business, which gives Amazon much more   freedom to expand its e-commerce ecosystem with low-margin   hardware like its Echo speakers, loss-leading services like   Amazon Video and Prime Now, and logistics solutions like new   fulfillment centers and drones.2. AWS' operating margin of 26%AWS finished last quarter with an operating margin of 26%,   compared to 24% in the year-ago quarter. That margin expansion   indicates that AWS' massive scale is offsetting tough price   competition across the cloud platform market, which caused Amazon   and its rivals to reduce their prices throughout the year.3. AWS' annual run rate of $14 billionAmazon announced that AWS had achieved an annual run rate of   $14 billion, indicating that it maintains a commanding lead overMicrosoft's(NASDAQ: MSFT) Azure in the cloud platform race.Microsoft claimed that its ""commercial cloud"" had achieved an   annual run rate of over $14 billion last quarter, but most of   that total came from SaaS platforms like Office 365 and Dynamics   CRM. Azure -- which competes directly against AWS in the   IaaS/PaaS ""cloud platform"" markets -- accounts for a much smaller   percentage.Microsoft doesn't disclose how much revenue Azure generates,   but  combining earlier industry estimates and its reported   growth rate  over the past few quarters indicates that its   annual run rate could be around $3 billion.4. Over 1,000 new AWS featuresAmazon already serves massive customers like NASA, the CDC,   andNetflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) with AWS, but it's continuously widening the   platform's competitive moat against rival platforms like Azure   with new features. Amazon added over  1,000 new features and   services to AWS in fiscal 2016, compared to about 700 in   2015.It also opened eleven new AWS Availability Zones across five   geographic regions in 2016, bringing AWS' total coverage to 42   Availability Zones across 16 regions globally. That massive data   center expansion will help AWS reach more companies and   developers, all while supporting the expansion of its e-commerce   and digital ecosystem into new markets.5. Prime Video in over 200 countriesA big part of that digital ecosystem expansion is Prime Video,   the company's streaming answer to Netflix. Amazon has made the   platform a ""free"" perk for Prime subscribers and a stand-alone   subscription service that costs slightly less than Netflix.Like Netflix, Amazon is investing heavily in original content,   and popular shows likeTransparentandMan in the High Castlehelped it become the third largest video streaming platform in   the U.S. after YouTube and  Netflix last year, according to   research firm Sandvine. Amazon is also following Netflix's lead   and investing heavily in localized original content in key   markets like Japan and India, which could help  expand its   Prime user base worldwide.6. 4,000 new skills for AlexaAmazon also taught its voice recognition platform Alexa 4,000   new skills since last October. It noted that ""tens of thousands   of developers"" are building new skills for the platform -- which   powers the Echo, Kindle, and Fire TV devices -- and that it was   working with ""a lot of major companies"" to integrate their   products with that ecosystem.The expansion of the Alexa ecosystem is important, because it   can give Amazon control of users' connected homes via Dash   buttons, DRS-enabled appliances, and other connected devices. In   addition to boosting its e-commerce revenue with ""frictionless""   orders, that platform can process data through AWS and widen its   moat in the smart home race againstAlphabet's Google, which is trying to establish its own home-based   ecosystem around its Home smart speaker.The key takeawayAmazon's fourth quarter report was lumpy, but investors   shouldn't overlook these positive numbers. Analysts still expect   Amazon's revenue and  earnings to respectively rise 22% and   53% next year -- so its overall growth won't peak anytime soon.   Therefore, I believe that investors should take advantage of   Amazon's temporary swoon and pick up a few more shares for the   long term.10 stocks we like better than MicrosoftWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Snap, Inc. Is Also Spending $1 Billion With Amazon AWS;2/9/2017;"Earlier today,Snap(NYSE: SNAP) filed its first amended S-1 with the Securities and   Exchange Commission. Companies often modify their initial   registration statements leading up to their IPOs, prior to   issuing a formal prospectus. Prospective investors already knew   that Snap is a big spender atAlphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google Cloud, which it relies on   for its cloud infrastructure needs.Snap is unique in its continued use of third-party   infrastructure vendorsat the scale at which it is operating; most companies invest in their own infrastructure once they   grow to a point where it's warranted. To a lesser extent, Snap   also purchases infrastructure services fromAmazon.com's(NASDAQ: AMZN) AWS.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();In the amended filing, Snap provided some additional detail on   its relationship with the e-commerce giant.Always have a contingency planTo be clear, Google Cloud is still Snap's main flame, but it   never hurts to have backup. In fact, contingency planning is   absolutely critical when your entire service relies on   third-party infrastructure partners, and this is the role that   AWS will play. The deal was inked just yesterday, which is what's   triggering the S-1 amendment.In last week's version, Snap said: ""We are currently   negotiating an agreement with another cloud provider for   redundant infrastructure support of our business operations.""   That line was replaced in this week's version with: ""We have also   committed to spend $1 billion with Amazon Web Services over the   next five years for redundant infrastructure support of our   business operations."" Snap says an existing agreement with AWS   that was originally entered into in March 2016 was amended on   Feb. 8, 2017.That $1 billion commitment will slowly ramp up, starting with   $50 million in spending this year. That's a tiny drop in the   bucket compared to the $12.2 billion in sales that AWS did in   2016. Snap is on the hook to spend $350 million with AWS in 2021.   In contrast, the agreement with Google Cloud that was finalized   on Jan. 30, 2017 calls for a flat $400 million per year for five   years, with a little bit of leeway in shifting spending to   subsequent years (up to 15% in each of the first four years).Data source: Snapchat amended S-1. Chart by author.Combined with its $2 billion commitment with Google Cloud,   we're looking at $3 billion pledged between Google Cloud and AWS   over the next five years. Snap's cloud strategy of relying   entirely on third-party partners is risky for many operational   reasons, but that's an awful lot of financial pressure for the   start-up. In 2016, cost of revenue exceeded revenue, resulting in   a negative gross profit of nearly $50 million, and infrastructure   costs are the largest component of cost of revenue.Snap only recently rolled out its automated ad sales API in   October, which exited beta just a couple weeks ago. The company   will now need to ramp ad sales faster than its infrastructure   spending commitments if it hopes to generate gross profit in the   years ahead. And we haven't even started talking about operating   expenses yet, which totaled $473 million last year.Hopefully, that API works pretty darn well.10 stocks we like better than Snap Inc.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

However, revenues of $717.2 million missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $737.7 million.On a year-over-year basis, revenues were up a mere 1%. This is the company's lowest gain since it went public. Revenue growth has been decelerating over the last several quarters.Moreover, advertising revenues were down in the quarter to $638 million from $641 million reported in the prior-year quarter.Twitter's user growth wasn't overly impressive, yet again. Monthly average users (MAUs) increased from 317 million to 319 million this quarter, up 0.6% sequentially. Year over year, MAUs increased 4%. Mobile MAUs were 83% of total MAUs. Average DAUs were up11% year over year.Quarterly Numbers in DetailsThe company posted non-GAAP earnings per share of 16 cents per share, flat year over year.Coming to ad metrics, there was a 151% year-over-year surge in ad engagements but cost per ad engagement was down 60%, given the shift to auto play video, which has lower cost per view compared to click to play.Mobile advertising revenues contributed 89% to total advertising revenue in the quarter. Data licensing and other revenues increased 14% to $79 million.Twitter earned nearly 38.6% of its revenues from international markets. International revenues rose 12% year over year to $277 million in the reported quarter. U.S. revenues decreased 5% year over year to $440 million.The company reported 12% increase in adjusted EBITDA to $215 million. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 30%, up from 27% in the year-ago quarter.Twitter, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS     SurpriseTwitter, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS   Surprise|Twitter, Inc. QuoteTwitter reported an operating loss of $143.6 million, which compared unfavourably with a loss of $67.2 million reported in the year-ago quarter.Balance Sheet & Cash FlowAt the end of Dec 31, 2016, cash and cash equivalents (short-term investments) were $3.77 billion compared with $3.49 billion at the end of Dec 31, 2015. For the year, cash flow from operations was $763.1 million and adjusted free cash flow was $444.1 million.OutlookFor 2017, stock-based compensation is expected to decrease in a range of 15% to 20% year over year while capex will be in a band of $300 and $400 million. Expenses are expected to be unchanged to decrease 5% year over year.For the current quarter, adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in a range of $75 million to $95 million while EBITDA margin is expected to be in a band of 17% to 17.5%.Our TakeTwitter has been a social phenomenon but somehow hasn't been able to leverage that success to boost user growth.At 319 million users, Twitter falls way behind other social media services like Facebook Inc.FB, which has over 1.8 billion users. Even Facebook's subsidiary, Instagram has over 600 million users. The complex nature of the service has been often considered as a major hindrance to user growth.Though the company has been working hard to bring about a turnaround, its efforts are yet to yield the desired results. Focus on Live video content, a flurry of live streaming deals, user friendly changes, measures to curb the trolling menace, and divestment of non-core operations, and layoffs, the company has been doing it all. But all these are yet to move the needle for Twitter.Twitter's standalone status has already been questioned last year with AlphabetGOOGLand The Walt DisneyDISspeculated to have shown interest in buying the company. Given the dismal results, the buyout rumors might resurface.At present, Twitter carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

BlackBerry Ltd (BBRY) Stock Worth $8 a Share;2/9/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSaying it is better late than never is cliché, so whenBlackBerry Ltd(NASDAQ:BBRY) announced it would license BBM, the news was met with yawns. The stock moved a bit over 4% on the week. Still, BBRY's march away from hardware devices and towards software sales will pay off. And with potential earnings growth of 31.6% next year (perFinviz), BBRY may make a run back to $8 a share.makeArticleAd();Source:WEi WEi via FlickrNokia Corp (ADR)(NYSE:NOK), BlackBerry's former rival, trades at a price-to-sales ratio of 1.11.

Snap Just Became One of Google's Most Important Cloud Customers;2/9/2017;"One of the many interesting details revealed inSnap's S-1 filing with the SEC is that it agreed to a $2 billion   contract with Google Cloud in January. The agreement with theAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) subsidiary spans five years with   relatively equal payments scheduled for every year.Snap has used Google Cloud since its creation, but had been   spending considerably less than the $400 million per year it's   slated to spend through 2021. For the first few years of its   existence, it spent less than $30 million per year on Google   Cloud. Last year, however, it started seeing its hosting costs   increase considerably, up $192 million for the year.Image Source: GettymakeArticleAd();Google's cloud service competes against the largerAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Web Services andMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Azure. A $2 billion infusion could help it catch   up to the competition.What does $2 billion mean to Google Cloud?Alphabet isn't exactly forthright with its cloud revenue. It   lumps Google Cloud in with Google's other revenue line item,   which also includes Google Play and hardware sales. In 2016, the   three categories produced $10.1 billion in revenue. Google Play   likely accounts for the bulk of revenue.The cloud unit had an estimated run rate of just $1 billion as   of the end of 2015, according to RBC Capital. Snap's new contract   likely makes it Google's biggest cloud customer.While Google has made several advancements in its cloud   services over the past year, so have its competitors. Microsoft   boasted that its Azure revenue increased 93% last quarter, but   Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss estimates the unit brought in   just $1.6 billion. Bernstein's Mark Mordler estimates Azure's run   rate at $3 billion as of last quarter.Meanwhile, Amazon just reported AWS sales topped $12 billion   in 2016. Sales surpassed $3.5 billion in the fourth quarter   alone, although that fell short of analysts expectations.Google still needs to diversifyThe growth of Snapchat has been a major boon to Google's cloud   services, but it's still actively seeking to pull customers away   from its competitors and take market share. The hiring of   cloud-computing veteran Diane Greene to lead the division has   helped the company attract numerous high-profile customers, but   there's still more work to do.On Alphabet's fourth-quarter earnings call, Google CEO Sundar   Pichai said, ""We have truly differentiated offerings in four key   areas: data analytics and machine learning, security and privacy,   tools for application development, and the ability to create   connected business platforms."" Snap can take advantage of at   least three of those four factors, so it's clear why it was   willing to lock down a long-term contract.At the same time, the contract is not exclusive. If Snap wants   to enter China, for example, where Google doesn't operate, it   could tap one of Google's competitors. Or it could build its   own servers.Snap recently hired Jerry Hunter from AWS, who ran global data   centers for the cloud-computing giant. In Snap's S-1 filing,   management notes, ""In the future, we may invest in building our   own infrastructure to better serve our customers.""If Snap continues to grow at the pace it has been for the last   few years, it may make economic sense for it to switch to its own   cloud infrastructure, which would be a huge blow for Google.What this means for SnapSnap is now on the hook for $400 million per year in cloud   costs. There is some wiggle room: The contract says it can   postpone up to 15% of expenses for a year, so it only has to   spend $340 million this first year. Still, that's a huge amount   for a company that generated just $404.5 million in revenue last   year.It also means that switching service providers will be   difficult, considering it would either have to eat the contract   as a loss, or leave at least some of its operations on Google   Cloud in order not to waste the money. That makes the economics   of building out its own infrastructure within the next five years   even costlier.On the flip side, analysts expect Snap's revenue to continue   growing at a rapid pace, approaching $1 billion this year fueled   by continued user growth and product expansion that will surely   put additional demands on Google's servers. It has plenty of   capital to cover the expense, and if last year's growth is any   indication of what to expect, it will need to spend at least $340   million on cloud infrastructure this year. The deal with Google   ensures that it gets the lowest rates possible, so it can to make   the most of its spend.Overall, it's not a bad deal for Snap, but it does tie the   company to Google for a long time.10 stocks we like better than Alphabet (A     shares)When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Finally Fires Back at Apple With Android Wear 2.0;2/9/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAfter delaying the release for months,Alphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) finally launched Android Wear 2.0, the new version of its smartwatch operating system. Along with the new OS, which incorporates advanced features like Google Assistant, new Google smartwatch hardware was announced. Made in partnership withLG, the new devices are premium quality, made to take full advantage of Android Wear 2.0 and ready to take on the Apple Watch.makeArticleAd();Source: GoogleHere's what you need to know.Google knows it didn't exactly hit the ball out of the park when it first released its Android Wear smartwatch OS.Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) has dominated the smartwatch market since its release and despite an overall cooling for smartwatches in general, it looks as thoughApple Watch absolutely destroyed the competition over Christmas.That has to be especially galling to Google, considering the Apple Watch is only compatible with iPhones, while Android Wear smartwatches work with nearly 90% of the smartphones being sold today. And while Apple Watch remains locked into a clunky square watch face, Android Wear supports the traditional, round wristwatch look.Android Wear 2.0 Key FeaturesGoogle was originally supposed to release Android Wear 2.0 last September, but decided todelay it to this spring. Theofficial announcementlanded yesterday afternoon on GOOGL's blog.7 Tech Stocks That Are Bucking the DowntrendWhat did Google engineers spend the extra time working on? It appears that they had several major goals: improving on the basic features most smartwatch owners use (such as fitness tracking), cutting the cord to a smartphone with LTE support, and making Android Wear 2.0 smartwatches as compatible as possible with the iPhone.Key features Google is showing off include:Improved fitness tracking with Google Fit appLTE support for running apps and making voice calls directly from a smartwatch without requiring connection to a smartphoneGoogle Assistant is integratedCustomizable watch face componentsGoogle Play access direct from smartwatchSupport for hardware control similar to Apple Watch digital crownIn particular, the ability for more apps to run independently on Android Wear 2.0 devices - with no need to be connected to a smartwatch - means iPhone users will get almost the same experience as Android phone owners. Assuming GOOGL can convince them to skip the Apple Watch.New Google Smartwatch Is From LGRumors had been flying that alongside the new operating system, the first Google smartwatch would make an appearance. That made sense considering GOOGL's push into branded hardware with the Google Pixel Phone and devices like Google Home and Google WiFi.Xiaomi Was Going to Rival Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock -- What Happened?However, the two new smartwatches unveiled as part of the announcement are from LG, in collaboration with GOOGL.The LG Watch Style is a relatively basic model. It lacks advanced capabilities like GPS (or even a heart rate monitor), but delivers smartwatch features in a slim, traditional wristwatch form factor. The round display is a 1.2-inch OLED screen at 360 x 360 pixel resolution and the watch has all-day battery life. It comes with a leather strap and for an extra $30, a Rose Gold color option.The LG Watch Style is the bigger and more capable device, fully able to take full advantage of all Android Wear 2.0's new features. The 1.38-inch P-OLED display has a crisp 480 x 480 pixel resolution. The round frame is stainless steel, with IP68 water resistance. There's a heart rate monitor and GPS for fitness, Connectivity includes Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, LTE and NFC for Android Pay. Battery life is rated for all-day, but use of features like LTE and the heart rate monitor can significantly cut that.They're premium devices, designed to take on the Apple Watch and GOOGL's involvement means they make the most of Android Wear 2.0. But they aren't the official Google smartwatch … well see if that comes later.Availability and PricingGoogle says Android Wear 2.0 will begin rolling out ""in the coming weeks."" Most current Android Wear smartwatches should be eligible for the free update, but not all watches will support all features. The LG Watch Style and LG Watch Sport will retail for $249 and $349 respectively and will go on sale in the U.S. starting Feb. 10.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceApple Inc.

Intevac, HP, Twitter, Facebook and Google highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day;2/9/2017;"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL - February 09, 2017 -Zacks Equity ResearchhighlightsIntevac(NASDAQ:IVAC-Free Report) as the Bull of the Day andHP Inc(NYSE:HPQ-Free Report) as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis onTwitter(NYSE:TWTR-Free Report),Facebook(NASDAQ:FB-Free Report) andGoogle(NASDAQ:GOOGL-Free Report).Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:Bull of the Day:Intevac (NASDAQ:IVAC-Free Report) recently reported a very strong quarter at the start of February. The company posted EPS of $0.13 when the Zacks Consensus Estimate was calling for $0.07. That $0.06 beat was good for a positive earnings surprise of 85%. That big beat put the stock on a lot of radar screen but it is the Bull of the Day for another, much more important reason.DescriptionIntevac makes vacuum deposition equipment for various thin-film applications, and digital night-vision technologies and products. Intevac, Inc. was founded in 1990 and is headquartered in Santa Clara, California.Growth And ValueGrowth investors and value investors are looking for different things and usually a good growth stock is not a value. IVAC posted revenue growth of 76% on a year over years basis in the most recent report. That followed growth of 23% in the previous period.On the value side, the company noted that book value at the end of the quarter as $71M, and with the stock trading at just under $200M in market cap we have a 2.8x price to book multiple. Usually, value investors are looking at stocks that have a price to book multiple of less than 3x, and IVAC fits the bill.Follow Brian Bolan on Twitter @BBolan1Why I Like ItThis stock is the Bull of the Day because of the tremendous increase in earnings estimates. Over the last five or so years of being at Zacks I don't think I have ever seen an estimate increase like this from a company as small as this.Bear of the Day:HP Inc (NYSE:HPQ-Free Report) has slipped to a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) with earnings just a few weeks away. This is not a good signal for investors that want to trade around earnings and it could extend the stock's losing streak to 3 - as in the number of times the stock has traded lower in the session following the report.HP Inc is part of the old Hewlett-Packard and is still a widely held stock.Earnings HistoryThe earnings history is pretty good of late, with a couple of beats of the Zacks Consensus Estimate and a few meets. On the top line I see only one miss in the last five quarters, so that too is a good thing to see.EstimatesHere is where we separate the pretenders from the contenders. Estimates for HP Inc have fallen of late, moving from $1.62 in August down to $1.60 at the current level. That doesn't seem like enough to merit a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) but then I looked at the next fiscal year.The fiscal 2018 estimate has slipped from $1.68 to $1.65, and again this is another small move.Going ForwardThis stock is a probably the ""softest"" Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) that I have ever seen. That said, a move to a #5 before earnings is not a good signal.Additional content:A Few Things to Know Ahead of Snap, Inc.'s Spring IPOSnap Inc., the parent company of the disappearing messaging app Snapchat, on Thursday, Feb. 2 filed its highly anticipated IPO.The five-year-old California-based technology company has evolved its business model in the last few years, and its user base is made up of the coveted 18-to-34-year-old demographic. But does Snapchat's popularity with American Millennials make Snap's IPO worth its estimated $20 to $25 billion valuation come March?The short answer: no one knows.Brief BackstoryTwitter (NYSE:TWTR-Free Report) went public in Fall 2013, and it has failed to meet the expectations of its similarly lofty initial valuation ever since. So, it might be best to temper expectations for Snap Inc. But here are some facts to help put the next big tech IPO into perspective.Facebook (NASDAQ:FB-Free Report) tried to buy Snapchat for $3 billion cash in 2013. Evan Spiegel, Snapchat's co-founder and CEO, turned the offer down. Since then,the social media giant has focused on competing with and mimicking Snapchatin the race to own the under-34 demographic online.Snapchat began as a disappearing picture and video messaging app. And it quickly became popular with young people. Over the past few years,behind an ever growing and loaded group of top executives, Snap has focused on user engagement, increasing advertising revenue, and innovation - its prospectus proudly proclaimed, ""Snap Inc. is a camera company.""Advertising DollarsIn the last two years, Facebook shifted its focus to video and live video, in part because it saw Snapchat's success. But more importantly, because that is where the advertising dollars are shifting.As young people shift away from regular linear television viewing, advertisers need new outlets to reach that coveted audience. Nielsen reported a 37% decline in the amount of time 18-to-24-year-olds watched TV between 2010 and 2016. And many reports indicate that a larger percentage of advertising budgets will be spent online by 2020.Snapchat has partnerships with the four major North American professional sports leagues, MLB, the NFL, the NHL and the NBA. The company also has content and sponsorship deals with major media outlets such as ESPN, CNN, and Buzzfeed. It also runs standard video ads spread out between users' content.The company still sells most of its ad space in-house.But Snap announced it updated its ad platformto allow marketers the ability to purchase ads in real-time through automated ad-buying technology used heavily by Facebook and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL-Free Report), and now dominates the space. This will give Snap the opportunity to increase its ad revenue - the key to its profitabilityUser BaseMillennials use the app, unlike Twitter or Facebook. Snapchat users send and post photos or videos that never last longer than 10 seconds. Time sensitivity has fostered massive active user engagement, which is key to its long-term profitability.A portion of Snap's IPO pitch focused on its ability to engage with the 18-to-34-year-old demographic. This focus is due in large part to the fact that Snapchat's user base and global reach is microscopic compared to Facebook.""If we fail to retain current users or add new users, or if our users engage less with Snapchat, our business would be seriously harmed,"" the filing noted.Yet, Snapchat users spend an average of 25 to 30 minutes a day on the app, while Facebook users, which include Instagram and Messenger, spend 50 minutes.Snap Inc. closed 2016 with 161 million daily users, and its average revenue per user rose to $1.05 in the fourth quarter from $0.31 a year ago. The company reported revenue of $404.5 million. Still, it reported a loss of $514.6 million, up from a loss of $373 million the year before.Facebook made $7 per user in the fourth quarter 2016 from its 1.2 billion users. The company reported revenue of $27 billion.Snapchat added 50 million daily active users in 2016. But user growth curtailed near the end of the year, adding just five million users in the fourth quarter. The company's offering last week noted that this was due to competition. One such competitor is Instagram, which now allows users access to similar disappearing video messaging features.Last quarter was Snapchat's smallest quarter-over-quarter user jump in three years.New EndeavorsSnap recently introduced its first product, Spectacles, in Fall 2016. The new sunglasses have video cameras that allow users to post directly to Snapchat. As of now, Spectacles aren't widely available.The company has grown its popularity through many unique and innovative partnerships. It recently partnered with the BBC for the release of the U.K.-based network'sPlanet Earth II. Partnerships outside of the U.S. will be key as the company tries to expand and grow Snapchat's user base.Snap is set to issue only nonvoting shares come March. Despite Snap's experienced leadership team, Spiegel and co-founder and CTO Bobby Murphy will maintain a vast majority of the company's voting shares when it goes public.Spiegel, 26, and Murphy, 28, currently hold roughly 90% of the voting shares. If either were to die, or become unable to perform his role, the other could control almost all of the voting power.Just Released - Driverless Cars: Your Roadmap to   Mega-Profits TodayIn this latest Special Report, Zacks' Aggressive Growth Strategist Brian Bolan explores a full-blown technological breakthrough in the making - autonomous cars.

What Is Unearned Revenue, and Why Should Amazon Investors Care About It?;2/9/2017;"A small line item onAmazon.com's(NASDAQ: AMZN) balance sheet has been growing rapidly over the   past couple years. Since the end of 2014, Amazon's unearned   revenue liability increased from $1.8 billion to $4.8   billion. Some investors might see a growing liability and   think that's bad news, but in fact this is very good news.Unearned revenue is simply cash customers have paid to Amazon   in advance for services it has yet to render. For example, Prime   members typically pay $99 up front for a full year of the two-day   shipping program. Amazon immediately takes the cash and puts it   on its balance sheet, but it amortizes the $99 of revenue over   the 12 months of the membership. So it accounts for only $8.25   per month in revenue per month for each Prime member. The rest of   the cash received for Prime is held in the unearned-revenue   balance.Prime growth has been very good over the past few years.   Amazon says it added ""tens of millions"" of new members last year.   But Prime isn't the biggest driver of unearned revenue. More   likely, Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the biggest factor pushing   the balance higher.makeArticleAd();Image source: Getty Images.Maybe last quarter wasn't so disappointingFor the first time since Amazon started breaking out AWS   revenue and income, the cloud-computing segment missed analysts'   expectations. Sales totaled $3.5 billion in the fourth quarter,   where analysts were expecting $3.6 billion on average.But unearned revenue climbed $568 million from the previous   quarter. That's unusual for Amazon's fourth quarter. Usually,   unearned revenue spikes in the first quarter as cloud customers   presumably re-up short-term contracts for the year.Most of Amazon's AWS customers are small businesses using its   pay-as-you-go pricing, which allows them to quickly scale their   use. The solution works well for companies with small or   unpredictable user bases.But a lot of AWS's money comes from the big enterprises that   spend hundreds of millions every year on cloud computing. For   those companies, with more predictable usage needs, Amazon offers   ""reserved instances,"" which offers a discount if customers pay up   front. Growth in reserved instances, or other long-term   contracts, may have resulted in lower revenue in the short term,   but it nearly guaranteed revenue in the future.Locking in customersAs the competition for cloud-computing infrastructure   continues to heat up, long-term contracts may prove invaluable.   Locking in customers for a relatively long term means those   enterprises will start optimizing their code so that it runs more   efficiently on the specific hardware and platform they're   using.Such is the case withSnap(NYSE: SNAP) , which uses Google's cloud. In its S-1 filing, Snap   says it built its app to use ""services provided by Google, some   of which do not have an alternative in the market,"" asRe/Code'sPeter Guagenti points out. Not only did Snap just agree to a $2   billion five-year contract with Google, but it's also going to be   hard for it to leave Google even after the five years is up.   That's excellent news forAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) investors., and not as excellent   for Snap investors.Ultimately, signing long-term contracts provides a moat   against the growing competition. Not only does it lock in   customers for the length of the contract, but it could also lock   them in longer if they become dependent on certain features of a   cloud platform. In that light, Amazon's fourth-quarter AWS   results look quite strong.Find out why Amazonis one of the 10 best stocks to buy nowMotley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more   than a decade beating the market.

Snap, Inc. Is Pioneering a New Cloud Strategy. Will It Work?;2/8/2017;"Amazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) may be leading the growing market for cloud   infrastructure, butAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) is still putting up a fight.Cloud infrastructure vendors have been crucial in enabling   smaller start-ups, particularly those that are building mobile   apps, to get up and running without having to worry as much about   the back end. It's an appealing model since it allows smaller   companies to simply pay for what they need without having to   invest in building the infrastructure themselves. In other words,   it's an OpEx model versus a CapEx model, andGoogle is betting bigthat the market is going to shift to the OpEx model in a major   way in the years ahead.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();But as companies grow, they often choose to invest in their   own cloud infrastructure. This gives them much more control over   their own destinies, reduces risk, and over time the cost   efficiencies improve after the large upfront investment.Social media peersFacebook(NASDAQ: FB) andTwitterboth operate their own data centers; Facebook announced itsseventh data centera few months back, while Twitter's infrastructure operations are   expanding more slowly, as it operates in co-located facilities.   Data centers are so strategically important to Facebook that it   helped create the Open Compute Project back in 2011, publicly   sharing Facebook's infrastructure innovations for the greater   good.But notSnap(NYSE: SNAP) .Hey, big spenderSnap primarily relies on Google Cloud for its infrastructure   needs. While this is entirely par for the course for mobile app   start-ups, Snap has grown to a size (nearly 160 million daily   active users) that would typically warrant investing in   infrastructure. The sheer scale of Snap's use of Google Cloud is   what's unprecedented here. The Information reports that Google   landed Snap with numerous discounts and other benefits, and Snap   very much relies on Google Cloud at this point, although it also   uses Amazon's AWS to a lesser degree.Back in 2014, Snap CTO Bobby Murphy said the company picked   Google Cloud over AWS because the company could scale better on   Google Cloud. Snap poached AWS' head of data centers in October   of last year, which is a peculiar move as it may imply that Snap   has longer-term ambitions to build out its own   infrastructure.But for now, Snap is firmly in bed with Google Cloud, and   spends quite a bit of money. Infrastructure costs comprise the   bulk of Snap's cost of revenue. From the S-1: ""Cost of revenue   consists primarily of payments to third-party infrastructure   partners for hosting our products. Hosting costs primarily   include expenses related to bandwidth, computing, and storage   costs."" Cost of revenue in 2016 was $452 million, and Snap has   committed to spending $2 billion with Google Cloud over the next   five years.But at what cost?In discussing its operating leverage, Snap believes that using   a capital-light business model will translate into ""lower costs   for us in both the short and long term."" That's definitely true   in the short term, but much more debatable in the long term.Having a larger proportion of fixed costs actually helps with   operating leverage as the business grows, since those fixed costs   get spread out over an increasing revenue base over time,   reducing total average costs. In contrast, if a company's cost   structure has a larger proportion of variable costs, those costs   will scale commensurately with revenue, so you don't get as much   margin expansion. It's already telling that Snap's cost of   revenueexceededrevenue in 2016 ($405 million), resulting in negative gross   margin.We saw this all play out years ago in the semiconductor   industry, with the rise of the ""fab-less"" and ""fab-lite"" models   that are dominant today. Building a chip fab costs billions of   dollars, which was a significant barrier to entry. Then contract   chip manufacturers came around and allowed companies to focus   more on designing the chips while the manufacturing partners   would produce them. By outsourcing production to a few large chip   manufacturers, the industry collectively saved billions and   innovation flourished. Semiconductors mostly shifted to the OpEx   model long ago, and there are only a handful of companies that   currently manufacture their own chips these days.Snap is wading into uncharted territory by relying on   third-party infrastructure partners at this scale. Whether or not   this proves right or wrong will also depend on how Snap grows   from here. One thing is for sure, though: Both aspiring start-ups   and infrastructure vendors will be watching closely to see how   this experiment unfolds.10 stocks we like better than SnapWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Here Are A Few Things To Know Ahead of Snap Inc.'s Spring IPO;2/8/2017;"Snap Inc., the parent company of the disappearing messaging app Snapchat, on Thursday, Feb. 2 filed its highly anticipated IPO.The five-year-old California-based technology company has evolved its business model in the last few years, and its user base is made up of the coveted 18-to-34-year-old demographic. But does Snapchat's popularity with American Millennials make Snap's IPO worth its estimated $20 to $25 billion valuation come March?The short answer: no one knows.Brief BackstoryTwitterTWTRwent public in Fall 2013, and it has failed to meet the expectations of its similarly lofty initial valuation ever since. So, it might be best to temper expectations for Snap Inc. But here are some facts to help put the next big tech IPO into perspective.FacebookFBtried to buy Snapchat for $3 billion cash in 2013. Evan Spiegel, Snapchat's co-founder and CEO, turned the offer down. Since then,the social media giant has focused on competing with and mimicking Snapchatin the race to own the under-34 demographic online.Snapchat began as a disappearing picture and video messaging app. And it quickly became popular with young people. Over the past few years,behind an ever growing and loaded group of top executives, Snap has focused on user engagement, increasing advertising revenue, and innovation - its prospectus proudly proclaimed, ""Snap Inc. is a camera company.""Advertising DollarsIn the last two years, Facebook shifted its focus to video and live video, in part because it saw Snapchat's success. But more importantly, because that is where the advertising dollars are shifting.As young people shift away from regular linear television viewing, advertisers need new outlets to reach that coveted audience. Nielsen reported a 37% decline in the amount of time 18-to-24-year-olds watched TV between 2010 and 2016. And many reports indicate that a larger percentage of advertising budgets will be spent online by 2020.Snapchat has partnerships with the four major North American professional sports leagues, MLB, the NFL, the NHL and the NBA. The company also has content and sponsorship deals with major media outlets such as ESPN, CNN, and Buzzfeed. It also runs standard video ads spread out between users' content.The company still sells most of its ad space in-house.But Snap announced it updated its ad platformto allow marketers the ability to purchase ads in real-time through automated ad-buying technology used heavily by Facebook and GoogleGOOGL, and now dominates the space. This will give Snap the opportunity to increase its ad revenue - the key to its profitabilityUser BaseMillennials use the app, unlike Twitter or Facebook. Snapchat users send and post photos or videos that never last longer than 10 seconds. Time sensitivity has fostered massive active user engagement, which is key to its long-term profitability.A portion of Snap's IPO pitch focused on its ability to engage with the 18-to-34-year-old demographic. This focus is due in large part to the fact that Snapchat's user base and global reach is microscopic compared to Facebook.""If we fail to retain current users or add new users, or if our users engage less with Snapchat, our business would be seriously harmed,"" the filing noted.Yet, Snapchat users spend an average of 25 to 30 minutes a day on the app, while Facebook users, which include Instagram and Messenger, spend 50 minutes.Snap Inc. closed 2016 with 161 million daily users, and its average revenue per user rose to $1.05 in the fourth quarter from $0.31 a year ago. The company reported revenue of $404.5 million. Still, it reported a loss of $514.6 million, up from a loss of $373 million the year before.Facebook made $7 per user in the fourth quarter 2016 from its 1.2 billion users. The company reported revenue of $27 billion.Snapchat added 50 million daily active users in 2016. But user growth curtailed near the end of the year, adding just five million users in the fourth quarter. The company's offering last week noted that this was due to competition. One such competitor is Instagram, which now allows users access to similar disappearing video messaging features.Last quarter was Snapchat's smallest quarter-over-quarter user jump in three years.New EndeavorsSnap recently introduced its first product, Spectacles, in Fall 2016. The new sunglasses have video cameras that allow users to post directly to Snapchat. As of now, Spectacles aren't widely available.The company has grown its popularity through many unique and innovative partnerships. It recently partnered with the BBC for the release of the U.K.-based network'sPlanet Earth II. Partnerships outside of the U.S. will be key as the company tries to expand and grow Snapchat's user base.Snap is set to issue only nonvoting shares come March. Despite Snap's experienced leadership team, Spiegel and co-founder and CTO Bobby Murphy will maintain a vast majority of the company's voting shares when it goes public.Spiegel, 26, and Murphy, 28, currently hold roughly 90% of the voting shares. If either were to die, or become unable to perform his role, the other could control almost all of the voting power.Just Released - Driverless Cars: Your Roadmap to   Mega-Profits TodayIn this latest Special Report, Zacks' Aggressive Growth Strategist Brian Bolan explores a full-blown technological breakthrough in the making - autonomous cars.

Amazon and Samsung Offerings Could Eat Into Google Search;2/8/2017;"Let me start by stating the obvious:Alphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google is the undisputed   champion of search. With over 60% of the US market and more than   90% of worldwide of worldwide search, Google is ubiquitous   and is not going anywhere any time soon. But even 800-pound   gorillas need to look around the room every now and then and see   what might be coming their way. From the looks of it, two fellow   titans are pushing products that might test Google's   strength.Google is the undisputed king of search. Image source:     Google.makeArticleAd();Bixby to bypass Google?Samsung acquires Viv virtual personal assistant. Image     source :VivLate last year,Samsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) acquired Viv, an artificial intelligence   company whose founders were the original developers ofApple'sSiri. With this purchase, Samsung joined the fray of thevirtual personal assistant. With several more years of development under its belt, Viv was   being billed as Siri's smarter sister that would work and play   well with others. In addition to the standard assistant chores   fare of language search, map directions, and weather, Viv was   able to respond successfully respond to extremely complex   questions and follow-ups, a skill lacking in other assistants.   With Samsung's acquisition, Viv was updated and reemerged as   Bixby, a virtual assistant which will make its debut in the   soon-to-be-released Galaxy S8. Samsung has plans to integrate its   recently acquired assistant into the majority of the native apps   on its upcoming phone.One of the more interesting features is the   camera featuring an optical character recognition system. By   pointing the camera at an object, and engaging the ""Bixby""   button, it seeks to identify said item and launches a native   search engine that circumvents Google search and locates the item   for purchase.There arepersistent rumorsthat Google has tried to prevent Samsung from making Bixby the   default on its phone, and it may find legal standing to do so.   Samsung phones use Google's Android operating system and the pair   have a non-compete as part of their patent-sharing agreement.Google may not want Bixby to bypass its search, though it   would not be the first such occurrence. Those familiar withAmazon.com's(NASDAQ: AMZN) failed Fire phone will recall a similar feature   -- Firefly -- that allowed users to take a picture of an object   and launch the item listing on Amazon's website. Amazon's phone   never gained any traction, so the fact that it bypassed Google's   search never resulted in any significant threat to Google's   search. The Galaxy S8 is unlikely to meet that same fate, even in   light of the the Galaxy Note 7'srecent difficulties.Consumers begin product searches on Amazon.comMore products searches start on Amazon than Google. Image     source: Amazon.comSpeaking of Amazon, astudyin June 2016 by PowerReviews found that 38% of US consumers   initiated a product search on Amazon versus 35% on Google.This   may be only the beginning. A largerstudyin September 2016 by BloomReach found that 55% of consumers begin   their search for a product on Amazon versus 28% on search   engines. The same report issued a year earlier reported 44% and   34% respectively. Amazon revealed that it is seeking to leverage   this and its massive library of product reviews by expanding paid   search, which will include not only products it sells, but items   not available on the site. This product and paid search will   extend to its virtual personal assistantAlexa and its Echohome systems. Few details have been released by Amazon, but this   will likely compete directly for Google's advertising   dollars. There is not yet any indication of a wider entry   into search, but with some estimates placing Amazon's Prime   membership at nearly half of US households, that might provide a   natural entry into the field.Those little things can add upGoogle is already dealing with lower costs-per-click as a   result of the migration from desktop search to mobile, with rates   falling 15% year over year in its most recent quarter. The   company was able to still grow the top line 22% in the most   recent quarter by making it up with volume, with aggregate paid   clicks up 36% year over year.Alphabet earns nearly 88% of all its revenue from Google's   search, and small challenges like these to its dominant position   could become legitimate threats to the company's cash cow   over time.10 stocks we like better than Alphabet (A       shares)When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock       tip, it can pay to listen.

Your Snap Shares Won't Get You Any Votes;2/8/2017;"One of the most interesting aspects ofSnap's(NYSE: SNAP) IPO filing is that the shares it's offering to the   public will have no voting rights at all. As a result,   co-founders Evan Spiegel and Bob Murphy will continue to control   a combined 88.6% of the company -- 44.3% each. ""Although other   U.S.-based companies have publicly traded classes of non-voting   stock, to our knowledge, no other company has completed an   initial public offering of non-voting stock on a U.S. stock   exchange,"" management wrote in its S-1 filing.Indeed, other companies have restructured their stock classes   so that a founder-CEO can remain in control. Snap is just being   more blunt about who's really running the show here.Image source: Snap.makeArticleAd();Most recently,Facebook(NASDAQ: FB) announced plans for a stock split so Mark Zuckerberg   could maintain control of the company as he gives away most of   his wealth to nonprofits and other causes.Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) also restructured its shares in   2014 to keep its founders in control. Snap is setting things   straight from the get-go.A simple look at Snap's voting rightsSnap has three classes of stock, and the voting rights are   laid out like so:ClassVotes Per ShareClass A0Class B1Class C10Source: Snap S1 filing.Individual investors will only be able to buy Class A shares   at Snap's IPO. The share classes do convert. One share of Class C   is convertible into one share of Class B. One share of class B is   convertible into one share of Class A. (No, you can't convert   shares the other way around.) As such, all shares of Snap stock,   regardless of class, will participate equally in the profit of   the company.How much is a vote worth?Alphabet has the same voting structure for its stock, with the   caveat that A shares have one vote, B shares have 10, and C   shares have no vote. Facebook announced it would split its shares   the same way at some point in the future.Shares of Alphabet provide the best look at how much investors   value voting rights. Class A shares, which provide one vote,   trade for a slight premium to the non-voting Class C shares. That   premium is currently about 2.5%.Alphabet A shares vs C shares. Source: Ycharts.So voting rights do represent some value to shareholders, or   at least potential shareholders. Activist investors could buy up   a significant portion of voting rights such that they can at   least have some sway at shareholder meetings. With Snap's IPO,   those shares won't be available to buy.Where things get messyFollowing the IPO, Evan Spiegel will receive an additional 3%   of all shares outstanding paid out quarterly over the next three   years as a bonus. Those will be Class C shares, and Spiegel will   then be able to exercise complete control over the company. In   the meantime, there's potential for deadlock votes between   Spiegel and co-founder Bob Murphy, as they each control   equal-sized stakes.But that's not the most concerning thing about the capital   structure at Snap. The only way for the founders to lose control   of the company is if they both die. As described in the S-1   filing, ""Either of our co-founders' shares of Class C common   stock will automatically convert into Class B common stock, on a   one-to-one basis, nine months following his death."" If that   happens, the other co-founder will have a controlling share of   the votes.In other words, both founders could leave the company but   still be able to exercise control over it.Facebook made provisions to its stock split to ensure that   Zuckerberg would only control the company's voting rights as long   as he remained CEO.There's a provision on Alphabet's Class B shareholders that   for every Class C non-voting share they sell, they must convert   one Class B share into a Class A share, and presumably sell that   as well. That makes it more difficult for the founders to retain   complete control. In fact, their combined percentage of the   shareholders' vote has fallen from 61% at the time of the stock   split to about 57% today.Snap's structure makes it so that not only do individual   investors have no voting rights, but the founders will continue   to control the company until both of them die. That's putting a   lot of trust in the founders, adding more risk to an already   risky investment.10 stocks we like better than Alphabet (A   shares)When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Snap IPO: Millennials Love It, Should Investors?;2/7/2017;"After months of anticipation,Snap(NYSE: SNAP)  finally made its publicS-1 filingwith the SEC. Form S-1 is used to register securities with the   SEC and provides prospective investors the first glimpse at a   company's financials and other data the company wishes to   disclose. Snap's S-1 has the standard balance sheet and income   and cash flow statements, but it includes a lot of juicy details,   as well.Image source: Snap, Author.makeArticleAd();We already know millennials love Snapchat, and management made   sure to highlight that fact. But should investors be equally   enamored with the highly anticipated IPO?Key financialsMetric/Year20152016Revenue$58.7 million$404.5 millionNet income($372.9 million)($514.6 million)Free cash flow($325.8 million)($677.7 million)Snap S-1 SEC filing.Snap is considered a growth company, and as such, its main   focus is on improving its top line. To that end, it managed to   increase revenue to $404.5 million last year from $58.7 million   the year before. That growth was fueled by an increase in the   total number of ads shown per user, as well as an increase in   total users. Snap introduced several new ad formats on Snapchat   last year and opened an application program interface (API),   which made it easier for more companies to buy ads.But that revenue growth came at a price. Snap invested heavily   in new research and development to create new ad products, as   well as sales teams to sell those ads. Snap also experienced a   148% increase in its cost of revenue, mostly related to hosting   costs it pays toAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) for its cloud platform. (It also   announced plans to spend even more with Google over the next five   years.)The result was a widening net loss. The company lost $514.6   million last year, 38% more than its $372.9 million loss in   2015.Snap also believes free cash flow is an important financial   metric since its reliance on Google's servers means it doesn't   incur huge capital expenses likeFacebookorTwitter, which own their own servers. Snap burned through $677.7 million   last year, up from $325.8 million in 2015.User growth and engagementSnap focused on daily active users in its filing, noting that   it's the most useful perspective of its business. Over the last   year, daily average users (DAUs) increased 48%, to 158 million.   The company noted it averaged 161 million DAUs in the month of   December, but it will use a quarterly average when it reports   results in the future.Source: Snap S-1.Snapchat's user growth has notably slowed over the last few   quarters, and Snap expects user growth to continue slowing.   Investors expecting Snapchat to reach any size resembling   Facebook will be disappointed.Snapchat's users are highly engaged, however. The company   notes the average user opens the app 18 times per day and spends   between 25 minutes and 30 minutes per day in the app.Over 2.5 billion Snaps are created every day. That compares   with Facebook, which says its users spend 50 minutes per day   between Facebook, Instagram, and Messenger. Twitter users spend   considerably less time in its app -- Comscore estimated just one   minute per user last year.That strong engagement implies that Snap has room to improve   its average revenue per user. Last quarter, Snapchat's ARPU was   just $1.05, $2.15 in North America. By comparison, Facebook   generated $4.83 per monthly user globally and $19.81 per user in   the U.S. and Canada.Even Twitter managed to produce $2.33 per global monthly user   in the fourth quarter last year. Considering Snapchat ads are   generally considered high value, there's a lot of room for   improvement in monetization of the existing user base.Should you buy it?Snap represents a very risky investment. It's going up against   stiff competition from Facebook, which is unabashedly copying its   main stories feature in Instagram. Its user growth is slowing as   a result. Users are also heavily concentrated in a few areas,   which Snap spins as a positive by saying it has a large presence   in some of the largest advertising markets. For most advertising   companies, however, breadth is the name of the game.Snap's also heavily dependent on Google Cloud for its   infrastructure, which will continue to cut into its gross income.   Management even lists potential disruption of Google Cloud as a   risk factor in the S-1 filing.Still, its revenue growth is exciting. The $405 million it   generated last year surpassed its internal expectations according   to a leaked document early last year. Analysts expect revenue to   reach nearly $1 billion this year, and its execution last year is   an encouraging sign that it can reach those expectations.   Snapchat's ad products are extremely compelling and unique   (although Facebook is doing its best to copy it), and it has the   young audience brand that advertisers covet.Ultimately, an investment in Snap at its IPO is an investment   in Evan Spiegel, the visionary CEO that's led numerous product   innovations at Snapchat. The S-1 filing also reveals that he's   done extremely well in acquiring technology and talent to support   Snapchat's growth.For investors willing to take on significant risk and who   believe in the vision and abilities of Evan Spiegel as a CEO,   Snap could make an interesting investment.10 stocks we like better than SnapchatWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Can Ubiquiti’s Run Continue in 2017?;2/7/2017;"While many technology investors no doubt enjoyed major gains   in the high-profile large-cap tech names in 2016, mid-cap   wireless companyUbiquiti Networks(NASDAQ: UBNT)  also had itself quite a year, rocketing 125%   in just the past 12 months. The company continues to fly under   the radar, despite having 38-year-old CEO who not only owns the   Memphis Grizzlies but can alsodunk a basketball.Take that, Zuckerberg and Musk!In its most recent quarter ended Sept. 30, revenues grew 35%,   and non-GAAP EPS grew a whopping 55% year over year, largely on   the strength of the Unifi segment. With the recent move in the   stock, investors may be wondering if they've missed the boat, but   I think the momentum can continue in 2017 for the following   reasons.makeArticleAd();IMAGE SOURCE: UBIQUITI NETWORKS, INC.Unifi goes up the value chainAs I mentioned, the star of 2016 for Ubiquiti was Unifi, which   grew 75% in the September quarter. This segment makes low-cost   enterprise hardware products, such as wireless access points,   switches, routers, security cameras, and VOIP phones, along with   software that allows IT professionals to track large networks   from a single user interface. Ubiquiti's low-cost business model   -- the company employs almost no sales force or service   professionals, and hires a limited number of ""all-star"" engineers   -- enables it to produce solid wi-fi products at rock-bottom   prices, and the product line caught fire in 2016. In January,   however, the company unveiled a new line of advanced products   aimed at higher-end customers, which is the turf of IT giants   such asCisco(NASDAQ: CSCO) andHP(NYSE: HPE) . The new products included the US-16-XG Switch for   $599 and a new Wave 2 access point for $349. These are much   higher price points than traditional Unifi products, but still   much lower than high-end access point vendors such as   Cisco's Meraki ($1,399), HP's Aruba ($1,395) andBrocade's(NASDAQ: BRCD) Ruckus ($1,295). Should Ubiquiti make inroads   into higher-end deployments, these new products could drive   Ubiquiti's already-sky-high 35% operating margin even higher.Ubiquiti looks as if it is finally making its move to disrupt   legacy IT players, just as prominent venture capitalist (and   former Ubiquiti board member) Bill Gurley predicted in 2014:""The fact that Cisco has never had a price disruptor over 30     years seems to violate the rules of the ""Innovator's Dilemma.""     I think many people believe that a disruption from underneath     is overdue. If I had to bet on anyone pulling that off it would     be [Ubiquiti CEO] Robert [Pera].""Airmax refreshWhile Unifi was the star of 2016, Ubiquiti's biggest segment   is still Service Provider, which accounts for 59% of total   revenues. Under the Airmax and Airfiber brands, this segment   makes high-powered radios that beam Wi-Fi over long distances   while achieving cable-like speeds. These radios are the building   blocks for Wireless Internet Service Providers (WISPs) in rural   and emerging markets worldwide, where fiber or satellite is too   expensive, and the spectrum is less cluttered. Airmax growth had   stalled in the past two years from its hyper-growth period a few   years ago, yet still grew 15% year over year in the September   quarter.There are reasons to think that 2017 could bring a   reacceleration for Airmax and its associated products. First,   Ubiquiti dropped the ball somewhat when it initially released   Airmax AC, as these hyper-fast products were not   backwards-compatible with older Airmax M radios. That meant   service provider customers would have to refresh their entire   networks of radios in order to upgrade, as opposed to upgrading   radio-by-radio. This was fixed in December with the release of   new firmware AirOS 8.0, which was no small task (it took over a   year!). Second, Pera recently revealed several new Airmax   products for 2017, including a GPON fiber product. While   Ubiquiti's radios are normally used to replace fiber, Ubiquiti   found out that many of its emerging-market customers can lay   fiber along power lines very cheaply, and this new product should   add to their arsenals. Even more exciting, the company revealed   an entirely new ASIC (application-specific integrated chip) it   has developed called LTU. As Pera explained:""It's been well over 3 years in the making, and we're going     to launch it next year. And it's going to be essentially     airFiber multipoint. But it's going to be light-years ahead of     anything in the market, and at cost points relevant to airMAX,     we're going to price it higher. The margins are going to be a     lot better... we think that's going to be a really big     differentiator in the market.""Again, we see Ubiquiti making a move to grow out of its   reputation as just a low-cost vendor, and into a company that   sells higher-quality (and, therefore, higher-margin) products as   well.AmplifiWhile Pera & Co. are at it, why not enter a completely new   customer segment? That's what Ubiquiti did this summer with the   introduction of Amplifi, a consumer router that will take onNetgear's(NASDAQ: NTGR) Orbi andGoogle's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) home router. Amplifi is gettingstellar reviewsso far, and just like Unifi's access points, it might pave   the way for other ancillary products for the connected home.Even though the Amplifi was unveiled last summer, it hasn't   produced much revenue for Ubiquiti yet. This is not because the   product wasn't great, but because the company was   capacity-constrained for the last half of 2016. As Pera said:""What I'm really, really, really frustrated about, is we     didn't execute on the production side. So we had demand for     tens of thousands of units out of the gate, and we've just been     slow to get these out.""That is what I'd call having ""champagne problems."" And while   Ubiquiti is going up against strong competitors such as Google,   Netgear, and others, the price-performance characteristics of the   product, as well as the secular tailwind of the connected home   makes me a believer that Amplifi could become a meaningful growth   driver as early as this year.The valuation is still reasonableEven after Ubiquiti's big move, the stock trades at a fairly   reasonable 23 times trailing earnings, which means the market is   pricing in decent, though not spectacular, growth from here.   Still, with a disruptive business model, a rock-solid balance   sheet, and a long runway in a secular growth industry, I think   Ubiquiti's stock can exit 2017 a good deal higher than where it   entered.Offer from the Motley Fool: The 10 best stocks to buy       nowMotley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent     more than a decade beating the market.

3 Stocks to Buy for Their Coming Rebound;2/7/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsEarning season can be either a nightmare or blessing for investors - or an ideal opportunity for those sitting on the sidelines to pick up a beaten up stock at an attractive price.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockGranted, there is a reason why stocks end up beaten up during earnings season. InFitbit Inc's(NYSE:FIT) case, the companypre-announceda horrendous fourth quarter.Mattel, Inc.'s(NASDAQ:MAT) salessufferedfrom a Christmas retail season slowdown whileUnder Armour Inc(NYSE:UAA)signaled to the marketthat it won't be growing at the rate it previously expected.All three of these stocks are now trading at multiyear lows or even all-time lows, but investors with an appetite for some risk in their portfolio could take advantage of these down-but-not-out stocks.9 Best Cheap Stocks to Buy Now Under $9.99So, here 's a look at why these beaten-down names are three stocks to buy for their coming rebound.Rebounding Stocks to Buy: Fitbit (FIT)Source:Via FitbitAs a long-term Fitbit shareholder, I was quite shocked when the company came out with a nasty pre-announcement which sent shares tumbling to new all-time lows. It has lost roughly 63% in the past year.The obvious question is, now what.With a market cap around $1.3 billion, investors could start hypothesizing that an acquisition in the works. Assuming Fitbit's cash and cash equivalents balance of $284.2 million (as of October 1, 2016) remains roughly unchanged, then Fitbit's enterprise value is barely $1 billion.This is a small price to pay for a fitness tracking company thatwas as of December(and likely remains) the clear and undisputed leader in the group.Rebounding Stocks to Buy: Mattel (MAT)Source:Horantheworld via Flickr (Modified)Mattel's unusual earnings miss sent the stock tumbling to around $25, leaving it at a loss of 18%-plus over the last year.The reason for the massive miss? The holiday selling season in both the U.S. and the international market was weak, and the holidays are when abouthalf of all toys are sold.No one is making excuses or trying to diminish the severity of the poor report but investors looking at the positive signs and willing to sit on MAT stock for some time could be rewarded over the long-term - and collect a near-6% dividend yield at the same time.Here are some of the positives that reaffirm the long-term story.The core Barbie brand which boasts impressive incremental margins saw its revenue grow 9% (constant currency) for the full year, although sales were down in Q4.Sales of Fisher-Price, the company's biggest brand, realized a 2% (constant currency) growth in the quarter.The Wheels brand (Hot Wheels, Matchbox, Tyco R/C) saw an 18% sales increase (constant currency) on the quarter.Mattel is now led byformer Google exec Margaret Georgiadis, who was recently named as CEO.7 Tech Stocks With Explosive Growth PotentialHer tech-savvy experience - not to mention coming in from an outside entity - could be just what is needed for MAT stock moving forward.Rebounding Stocks to Buy: Under Armour (UAA)Source: ShutterstockThe sentiment surrounding Under Armour has been poor, and any miss in its fourth-quarter print would send shares lower. However, the top-and-bottom miss was also coupled with a poor 2017 guidance and a surprising management change, which resulted in the stock plunging around 25%.But how much worse can it get? In short, there really isn't much more that can go wrong.Q4 gross margins fell to 44.8% from 48% a year ago and 2017's gross margins are expected to fall from 2016's level. We can cross gross margin erosion off our list of concerns for 2017 because weknowit will happen.UAA stockr guided its 2017 operating income to be lower on a year-over-year basis. Similarly, we can scratch this off our list of concerns for 2017 because we know it will happen.And we can also scratch off the sudden departure of a key executive, as Under Armour's CFO Chip Molloy announced he will be leaving the company.And the fact remains that Under Armour's wide variety of products is still in high demand, and there is plenty of room to grow.All UAA stock needs to do is beat the lowered bar for 2017, which some analysts believe is conservative. There is a lot going on Under Armour's favor, including a new partnership with retailerKohl's Corporation(NYSE:KSS) and the large international opportunity, which the company isn't losing its sights on.As of this writing, Jayson Derrick did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.The post3 Stocks to Buy for Their Coming Reboundappeared first onInvestorPlace."

GM's Race To Win Self-Driving Car War Provides Long-Term Opportunity;2/7/2017;"Like Tesla (TSLA), Google (GOOG,GOOGL) spinoff Waymo, Ford (F) and a host of others, General Motors (GM) is going full-force in the race to be the leader in autonomous cars.A new study shows that it's further along than previously thought, which is a good sign for investors, even if they're not happy with the company's fourth-quarter results.The California Department of Motor Vehicles released a number ofreportsearlier this month from various automakers and tech companies on what they're doing as it relates to self-driving cars and GM, long thought to be ceding the race, has vaulted its position, thanks to acquisitions and heavy spending.makeArticleAd();Cruise Automation, which GMboughtfor more than $1 billion in March 2016, is using a bunch of Chevrolet Bolt EVs to test its software and its cars out in the field. Cruise now has more than 20 vehicles licensed in California, up from just two in early 2016, when it was using a couple of Nissan Leafs.This is a bright sign for the Mary Barra-led company, as it looks to own the entire ecosystem of the next version of the automobile, instead of ceding the race to others.It's likely to keep dealing further into in this area, whether it'spartnering with Lyftor adding engineers to its self-driving car fleet in order to keep testing and building cars inDetroit.Projects like this are likely to help shareholders in the long-run, even if it impacts spending in the interim.In the fourth-quarter, GM earned $1.28 a share on $43.91 billion, ahead of estimates $1.17 a share on $41.53 billion in sales. Despite the earnings beat, investors sent shares lower on concerns of a slowdown in auto sales for 2017, as well as the potential for elevated inventory levels.It's unclear what impact, if any, self-driving cars are likely to have to vehicle volumes in the future. There may be a need for less cars, since they could be working more efficiently. Or there may be a need for a massive resurgence in sales, as costs come down and regulators incentivize manufacturers to make transportation safer.It's just a huge unknown at this point.GM has been building and manufacturing cars for over 100 years, giving it a leg up, at least in terms of the manufacturing process, over any of its Silicon Valley competitors. This is something that Barra has consistently cited as an advantage.“We have 100 years of really understanding vehicles, putting them on the road, making sure we have a safe, high-quality vehicle,” Barra told reporters at a December press conference. “When you take autonomous, electrification, connectivity, I think we are going to have a very special offering to the consumer.”The world is still a ways away fromLevel 5 autonomy(true autonomy, in which a car can drive by itself in any condition anywhere without any help from a human), so the self-driving car race is far from over.But it looks like GM, which has notoriously been secretive about its operations, is a lot further along than anyone thought. And that's something shareholders can rest easy about."

Twitter Inc (TWTR) Stock May Get Snapped After Earnings;2/7/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsInvestors have been getting bullish withTwitter Inc(NYSE:TWTR), as the stock has climbed about 13% so far on the year. As usual, there have been the various buyout rumors, which have probably accounted for quite a bit of the gain.makeArticleAd();Source:Andreas Eldh via FlickrYet might all this be another example of over eagerness with Twitter stock? Perhaps there will just be more disappointment when the company reports its earnings on Thursday?Well, the good news is that the bar is not set too high. The Street is expecting for Twitter earnings to come to 12 cents a share (on an adjusted basis) and revenues to hit $740.1 million.By comparison,last yearthe company reported profits of 16 cents a share and a top-line of $710 million.In other words, the consensus is for the revenues to grow by a mere 4.2%, which would represent the slowest ramp since TWTR became a public company. To put this into perspective,Facebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB)generateda massive $8.6 billion in revenues in Q4, up a sizzling 53%. So is it any wonder that Twitter stock has been mostly a bad investment?7 Tech Stocks With Explosive Growth PotentialOf course not.Now, in terms of the quarter, TWTR stock could benefit from some catalysts. Some of those include the impact of the holiday season as well as the wild presidential election and the live-streaming of NFL games.But such things will likely be temporary for Twitter stock. The fact is that the lackluster user growth will probably continue to weigh on the company. For example, Cantor's Youssef Squali isforecastingonly a 2 million net monthly active user increase in the base to 319 million, up 4.6%. This would be roughly the same as Q3's growth rate.But none of this should be a surprise. TWTR has been beset with frequent turnover in the executive ranks. It also does not help that the CEO, Jack Dorsey, spends time as the head ofSquare Inc(NYSE:SQ).Hey, do Zuckerberg orSnap'sEvan Spiegel side gigs? No, because they realize that the online world is brutally competitive.Bottom Line on Twitter StockActually, the Snap IPO may put even more pressure on Twitter stock. Investors will soon have another high-growth play to put their money into. As a result, TWTR stock will become more marginalized.Now. Dorsey has talked about improving the service and making it easier to use. But so far, the actions have fallen flat. Granted, at the start of the New Year, he asked users for feedback. Yet much of it was kind of vague. Instead, users would rather spend their time on platforms like FB, Instagram, WhatsApp and Snapchat. It's that simple. For the most part, TWTR has failed to keep up with the latest trends, such as with chat and video.Unfortunately, when a consumer tech company gets into this situation, it is tough to turn things around. Just look at classic examples likeYahoo! Inc.(NASDAQ:YHOO) andAOL. They spent years trying to find ways to juice up user numbers - but nothing seemed to work.Part of this is that the brand quickly loses its luster. But there is something else: resources start to dwindle as cash flows drop.In fact, both seem to be issues with Twitter stock. If anything, the brand appears kind of crusty and is also associated with harassment and bullying. Oh, and in terms of the core operations, the company has been reducing the workforce and unloading various segments, such as the recent sale ofFabrictoAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG).Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA) Stock Is Better Than Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN)The likely end-game for TWTR stock, of course, is a sale of the company. But of course, the problem there is that when the company put itself up on the block last year, there was little interest.This does not means things are absolutely hopeless. There are certainly investment opportunities with TWTR stock - but they are probably mostly short-term trades.Tom Taulli runs the InvestorPlace blogIPO Playbook.

Is Advertising Amazon's Next Big Growth Product?;2/7/2017;"In digital advertising there areFacebook(NASDAQ: FB) and Google, and then there's everyone else. But one   company is starting to emerge as a potential contender to the two   ad behemoths:Amazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) is starting to spread its wings as an   advertiser.Amazon certainly has the user data to compete with Facebook or   the bigAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) subsidiary. Although it has only   300 million active customers as of its last update, the shopping   data it has on those users is invaluable. In fact, Amazon may be   able to target advertisements better than Facebook or Google   despite their huge troves of user data. After all, nothing speaks   louder than how people spend their money.Image source: Amazon.com.makeArticleAd();What's this other revenue line item, and why's it growing so   quickly?During Amazon's fourth-quarter earnings call, UBS analyst Eric   Sheridan asked about the ""other"" line item on Amazon's income   statement. He pointed out that it's exhibited a lot of momentum   over the past few years and wondered if that was due to growth in   advertising.The other category includes ""certain advertising services and   our co-branded credit card agreements,"" according to Amazon's   quarterly report. While Amazon did just revamp its credit card   offering, it's been around in some form in the U.S. since 2002   and in Canada since 2012. The vast majority of growth in the   category is probably coming from advertising.And it's been growing. Last year, other revenue in North   America increased 60%. That accelerated to 81% growth in the   fourth quarter. That makes it Amazon's fastest growing source of   revenue, growing even faster than its cloud-computing service,   Amazon Web Services.Granted, the other revenue Amazon brings in accounted for just   1.7% of its total North American sales -- $1.3 billion. So it's   still working on a very small revenue base.Expanding its ad productsMost of the ads Amazon sells are on its own websites. Search   results on Amazon have an increasing number of sponsored   products, with which third-party merchants pay to show up at the   top of the page, not unlike Google's search advertising.   Management described sponsored products as ""off to a great   start,"" indicating they see a lot of room for expansion.A report from BloomReach last fall found that 55% of online   shoppers begin their product search on Amazon.com. As more and   more people search Amazon for products, the more ads it can show.   In fact, sponsored products could start stealing ad budgets away   from Google, which is whyEric Schmidt said it's Google's biggest   competitorin 2014.But Amazon's advertising is starting to extend beyond its own   websites, wading deep into Google's territory. Last year it   developed a header-bidding solution. Header bidding allows   publishers to take more offers for their ad inventory instead of   wading through each offer one by one and taking the first decent   one they find. (This is all done extremely quickly by computer   algorithms.)Amazon's advantage in the space is that it can perform the   complex algorithmic ad bidding process in its AWS servers,   enabling publishers' websites to load faster than other   header-bidding systems allow. Google has historically dominated   the space that header bidding threatens.As mentioned, Amazon is one of the few companies with user   data that can compete with the targeting capabilities of Facebook   or Google. So if it continues to build out its advertising   products on third-party websites, it could start to take a   significant share of revenue from Google and Facebook. Google   generated $15.6 billion in revenue from its network members'   websites last year. Facebook's Audience Network reached a $1   billion run rate in the fourth quarter last year, but the company   hasn't provided any updates since then.The digital ad market is huge. Advertisers spent $195 billion   worldwide on online ads last year, according to eMarketer. That   number is expected to grow to $335 billion by 2020. If Amazon can   grab just a slice of the market producing high-margin revenue, it   could provide a significant boost to its bottom line.Find out why Amazonis one of the 10 best stocks to buy nowMotley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more   than a decade beating the market.

3 Mutual Funds to Buy on Apple's Robust Earnings;2/7/2017;"The tech sector has performed favorably in recent times on the back of encouraging earnings results.Although Trump's proposed trade and immigration policies are expected to weigh on big technology companies, hiscorporate tax repatriation planscould benefit technology companies that hold a lot of cash overseas. These tech companies could repatriate that cash and use it for investments, dividends and buybacks.Tech behemoth Apple IncAAPLmade a strong rebound on the back of strong fiscal first-quarter earnings results. The good show was driven by impressive iPhone 7 and 7 Plus sales. Following these promising trends, investing in technology mutual funds with a significant holding in the iPhone maker and other tech giants will be a prudent decision.Q1 Earnings in FocusApple's fiscal first-quarter earnings of $3.36 per share and revenues of $78.4 billion easily topped the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.22 and $76.9 billion. On a year-over-year basis, earnings and revenues registered growth of 2.4% and 3.3% respectively. Services, which include revenues from Internet Services, App store, Apple Music, AppleCare, Apple Pay, licensing and other services, surged 18% year over year to nearly $7.2 billion.Additionally, total iPhone unit sales came in at about $78.3 million, up 5% year over year. Revenues from iPhone also grew 5% from the year-ago quarter to $54.4 billion (69.4% of total revenue). Moreover, optimism of the tech behemoth's forthcoming series of iPhone upgrades in the coming months encouraged some analysts to raise their price targets.Apple Rally Boosts Tech SectorGains in Apple came as a breather for the broader technology sector.

Can Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Pass This Turing Test?;2/7/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFinancially and technically,Facebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) seems to have everything going its way. Facebook's latest video announcements have it playinghardballagainstAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) andNetflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX) in the race to dominate the next generation of video. The company is rapidlyapproaching 2 billion usersin a world with 7 billion people.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockFacebook stock's fourth-quarter results were nothing short of awe-inspiring,as InvestorPlace writer Tom Taulli reported, net income rose 128% year-over-year, compared with 2015, as revenue rose 53%.The revenue run rate is still one-third that ofAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), but the companies are competing ever-more fiercely for the same internet advertisers and, increasingly, FB is winning.So why is Facebook stock sitting below its 2017 high? Why did it rise only 2% on those incredible earnings? Why does FB stock seem stuck in first gear?Call it the perils of leadership.Facebook Stock and Political OppositionFacebook has become a mirror on the human condition, and civilization's ills have come calling on it.7 Tech Stocks With Explosive Growth PotentialGangs are now waging theirturf warson the service. Its human decision-making is opaque, and people are being destroyed by thatwithout recourse.Worse, despite FB's insistence that it's not a media company, and that it is not political in any way, people are treating it as both.Many conservatives tied to the Trump Administrationnow count Facebook as an enemyandsuspect all those who work alongside it.This is happening even while FB goes to unprecedented lengths to fight terrorist propaganda,working alongside law enforcement and security agencies.The truth or falsehood of the political charges should be irrelevant to an investor. What matters is that Facebook is seen to be a media company, and seen to be a political actor, that it's being treated as such, and that responding to all this is expected to cost money, reducing margins and net income.Fortunately, FB stock has a way to fight back.FB Stock: A Turing TestFacebook stock is in a race against billions of people who want its network to pass a Turing Test. Its network must pretend to be human, and to act humanely, without using people to do it.Here are just some examples of what I'm talking about.FB must act againstfake news, phishing profilescreated by criminals, charges of political favoritism, plus millions of individual complaints about the actions of third parties,largeandsmall, in an automated fashion.This is because software scales in ways people cannot. If Facebook mustgo to court constantlyin order to protect itself, it can't continue to grow. It must automate its own self-policing, as with a recent patent application aimed atfighting a photo-tag spambot.3 Reasons Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Is Much More Than Its Main PlatformAt the same time, FB stock must fight charges that its software is becoming bloated, denseand difficult to use.It must accept the increased complexity of video rights managementin this regard.It also must accept the fact thatmistakes will be made by softwareacting in human ways, just as people make mistakes.Fortunately, all I'm describing is a need for more artificial intelligence, and that happens to be the area in software where Facebook is putting a lot of its money right now.The company's recent delivery of a system for identifying the content of photos, andallowing them to be searched as text is searched, is just the tip of the iceberg for what's ahead for Facebook stock.By fighting for its own survival with artificial intelligence, FB stock is pointing the way to a futuredefined by artificial intelligence. This is less about creating an ""artificial assistant,"" like Amazon's Alexa or Google Home, both advertised during last week's Super Bowl, and more about creating intelligence within the network so questions are answered before they are asked.If Facebook stock can succeed here, it can overcome both its own problems and a lot of yours, to mutual profit.Dana Blankenhornis a financial and technology journalist.

Zillow In Position To Dominate Online Real Estate Ad Market;2/6/2017;"Zillow Group(Z), operator of the online house-hunting network that dwarfs all competitors, has the inside track for winning a dominant share of real estate agents' digital ad spending.""Their competitive position is quite strong,"" said Macquarie Capital analyst Tom White.makeArticleAd();While the homes-for-sale data that underpins sites like Zillow and Realtor aren't proprietary, White notes that Zillow ""is out-innovating its competitors in augmenting that basic listings data"" with other data, including listings of homes not for sale, and by investing heavily in mobile.Citing comScore data, Zillow says its five brands account for nearly two-thirds of the total online real estate category and nearly three-quarters of the mobile segment.Yet White notes that there's ""a big disconnect"" between Zillow's majority share of traffic and its slice of the real estate advertising pie.Turning clicks into commission for agents and more ad dollars for Zillow turns out to be easier said than done.Fast CompanyA partial explanation is that a big slice of real estate advertising dollars is going to companies that aren't direct competitors, likeFacebook(FB) andAlphabet's(GOOGL) Google.But the good news for Zillow is that it has been getting better and better monetizing that traffic, growing sales by upwards of 30% over the past year even as real estate agents have lowered their overall spending on digital advertising.The bulk of Zillow's revenue - 70% in the last quarter - comes from its Premier Agent program, where sales rose 32.5% from a year ago. Real estate agents pay to have their picture, credentials and ratings linked to Zillow's listings of homes for sale, with up to four agents attached to each listing.Home shoppers who don't have an agent are likely to click on those with high ratings and a history of similar transactions, and that's exactly what Zillow wants to see.Zillow has a strategy to help accelerate the real estate industry's evolution to the survival of the fittest. Zillow is looking to help the best real estate agents - the ones who can best capitalize on the leads that Zillow generates and will therefore pay the highest ad prices - to extend their domination.[ibdchart symbol=""Z"" type=""daily"" size=""threequarter"" position=""rightchart"" ]""We are accelerating the broader trend across the real estate agent population of higher-producing agents gaining market share from those who are less productive,"" Chief Executive Spencer Rascoff said on a November conference call with analysts.Agent OverhaulRascoff also noted that Zillow overhauled the ways it sells ads to its Premier Agents last quarter. Under its old model, Zillow came up with a price for a fixed number of ad impressions based on a ZIP code's characteristics.But Rascoff noted that the fixed-price model sometimes sold out impressions in desirable ZIP codes, requiring the company to call up agents to increase ad prices. So now prices will be set dynamically, based on the total dollars agents budget to advertise on Zillow in a given ZIP code.The goal is ""to have the marketplace"" determine ad costs, Rascoff told analysts.Zillow, which reports fourth-quarter earnings on Tuesday, advised analysts on its November call that its guidance carried an extra margin of error because of the nationwide rollout of the new pricing strategy.Analysts expect the company to earn 11 cents a share vs. a one-cent loss a year ago, as revenue rises 31% to $222 million. In 2017 revenue is expected to grow 23% to $1.038 billion.Smaller Number, But Bigger SpendingThe number of agents advertising on Zillow declined modestly in the third quarter to 89,147, but that was part of a planned shakeout. At the same time, the number of advertisers spending at least $5,000 per month rose 79% from a year ago, while average spending per agent rose 46%.IBD'S TAKE:Zillow shares showed promise in early December, after forming acup-with-handleand starting to break out. But shares retreated into a flat base and remain there. Check out IBD Stock Checkup to see the top companies in theInternet-Content group.Tuesday's results also will provide a checkup on two other new initiatives: a partnership with Facebook and Zillow's first effort to monetize the sell-side of the housing market.Zillow is partnering with Facebook to offer a precision-ad targeting program that enables real estate agents to connect on Facebook with home shoppers who are using its site or Trulia, its sister property acquired in early 2015.Zillow also announced its Seller Boost program in October, involving the placement of Premier Agent ads on listings of its huge inventory of homes not for sale to provide potential leads for agents if the homeowner decides to sell.Leveraging The NetworkAt the same time, Zillow is trying to leverage its large network of users - 164.5 million in the seasonally slower third quarter - to get a broader slice of advertising dollars.Zillow's marketplace for mortgages, which connects homebuyers to area mortgage lenders much likeLendingTree(TREE), generated $19.8 million in revenue in the third quarter, up 57% from a year ago.The traffic at Zillow properties is roughly triple that of its closest direct competitor, Realtor.com, which was acquired byNews Corp.(NWSA) in November 2014.Thanks to the merger with Trulia, Zillow removed a major competitor. Meanwhile fears that News Corp. might jump-start the growth and promotion of Realtor.com have been mostly unfounded, Macquarie analyst White said.Bigger Slice Of PieBy some measures, though, Zillow has a growing slice of a pie that has been shrinking in recent years. Borrell Associates estimates that real estate agents spent $7.7 billion on digital ads in 2016, down from $9 billion in 2014. Some 78% of real estate ad spending was done online in 2016, Kip Cassino, Borrell's executive vice president of research, told IBD.The decline in spending partly reflects a relatively modest pace of home sales, especially among millennials, Cassino says. The other reason is that agents ""have become more discerning about how they spend,"" using Google keywords, social media or unpaid search engine optimization strategies.Still, digital spending, including spending on related technologies, has been growing as a percentage of agents' marketing budgets, Zillow says.Rascoff's focus is making sure Zillow is ""well-positioned for the billions of dollars of real estate agent ad spend which will surely migrate on to the internet over the next couple of years, and making sure that we've the right ad model to capture the lion's share of that.""After several days of losses, shares of Zillow reversed course late last week. The stock ended trading Friday up 1.6% to 35.93 and climbed another 1.9% Monday to finish the day at 36.62, right on its 50-day moving averageRELATED:Analyst Sees 'Modest' Earnings Upside For ZillowZillow Group Challenged By Rising Interest Rates, Says StifelZillow Group Stock Turbocharged By High-Spending 'Super Agents'"

3 Stocks We're Never Selling;2/6/2017;"We Fools are constantly on the hunt for winning stock ideas   that we believe will generate strong returns for years on end.   When we think we have identified a winning business, we like to   buy it and hang on to it through thick and thin.With that in mind, we asked a team of Fools to highlight a   stock in their portfolio that they plan to hang on to for the   ultra-long term. Read on to see why they pickedAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) ,Under Armour(NYSE: UA) (NYSE: UAA) , andStarbucks(NASDAQ: SBUX) .Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();Alphabet will continue to benefit from digital browsingJamal Carnette, CFA(Alphabet): The market wasn't kind to Alphabet's recently   reported fourth-quarter and full-year results. Overall, the   company continues to post enviable growth rates for a company of   its scale. Alphabet increased revenue 20.4% over the previous   year's results; on a quarterly basis, it grew revenue 22.2% over   last year's corresponding period. However, the company's   fourth-quarter bottom line increased by only 8.3%, to $5.3   billion, as Alphabet's provision for income taxes increased by a   massive 450% over last year's corresponding quarter, on account   of a one-time tax adjustment. Still, the fickle market sold off   shares to the tune of 2% because the company missed analyst   expectations.On a positive note, Alphabet confirmed that mobile search is   one of its highest-growth areas. The biggest shift in internet   browsing over the past five years has been from desktop to   mobile, and that move benefits Alphabet, considering Google   controls approximately 95% of the mobile-search market.The company also continues to grow its advertising business.   Earlier this year, a shocking report fromMorgan Stanleyanalyst Brian Nowak found that 85% of every new dollar in online   advertising was going to just two companies: Alphabet andFacebook. As the shift to online advertising continues, look for Alphabet   to continue to post strong revenue growth rates.Simply put, Alphabet's long-term thesis remains intact. The   company is the largest digital advertiser and search engine in   the world, and Alphabet will only continue to grow search and   advertising revenue as internet usage increases from a   combination of penetration and accessibility, while a push for   digital advertising will boost the company's bottom line.Still a believer in Under ArmourBrian Feroldi(Under Armour): The past six months haven't been kind to Under Armour's   shareholders. The stock took a big hit inlate October, after management ratcheted back its long-term growth   targets. More recently, shares gotcrushedafter the company reported sales growth of just 12% in the   all-important fourth quarter. Not only was that figure far shy of   management's guidance, but the company's CFO also resigned   suddenly. That's a lot of bad news for investors to take in all   at one time, so it was no surprise to see that shares took a big   hit.However, a closer look at the quarter hints that investors   shouldn't throw in the towel on this growth story just yet. While   total sales growth was disappointing, the biggest culprit was   slowing sales in North America. That's understandable, as the   retail environment stateside was quite challenging for many   retailers over the holidays. The recent bankruptcies of The   Sports Authority, Eastern Mountain Sports, Sports Chalet,   Golfsmith, City Sports, and Bob's Stores didn't help the matter,   either.However, Under Armour's report did contain a handful of bright   spots. Direct-to-consumer sales -- which bypass retailers   altogether -- jumped by 23% and now account for nearly 40% of   total sales. And footwear sales grew by a solid 36% year over   year. Best of all, international revenue grew by 55% and now   comprises 16% of total sales. These figures suggest that Under   Armour's brand still remains strong.While the company has some near-term challenges to overcome, I   have a hard time believing that this growth story is dead. As   long as founder and CEO Kevin Plank is at the helm, this is one   stock I can't ever see myself parting ways with.Middle-class people love their coffee, and there's about to   be a lot more of themJasonHall(Starbucks): The global coffee giant's stock is down around 8% since   first-quarter earnings came out in late January, and not without   some justification. After all, Starbucks reported that traffic in   its North American stores was pretty much flat in the quarter, a   trend that started in 2016 and could continue through 2017.   Furthermore, management indicated that it may feel the same way   and is now projecting revenue growth between 8% and 10%, a   reduction from original full-year guidance of 10% or greater at   the end of the prior quarter.But Starbucks isn't the kind of company that will scare me   away with a minor flattening of growth in its most mature market   -- especially not right now. Starbucks' best days could be   ahead of it, even as Howard Schultz steps down as CEO for the   second time.To start with, Starbucks' growth opportunity in Asia is simply   enormous. Within a decade, the middle class in China alone is   likely to be double the size of the U.S., and Starbucks'   management recently said it expects China to become the company's   biggest market. Here's a little more context: At the start of   2017, Starbucks had nearly 16,000 stores in the Americas, versus   fewer than 6,800 in the China/Asia Pacific region, with 2,500 of   those in China.Bottom line: Growth very well could slow further -- or even   stall -- in the company's more mature markets, but I won't sell.   The global growth story is only getting started, and that's going   to drive decades of growth. I'm not missing out on that.10 stocks we like better than Alphabet (C   shares)When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

The feat was especially impressive given that Xiaomi was not selling its phones in the U.S. market.9 Best Cheap Stocks to Buy Now Under $9.99Like Apple, Google andSamsung Electronics Co Ltd(OTCMKTS:SSNLF), the company wanted to expand into consumer electronics in general. That effort included the inexpensive Mi Band fitness tracker that vaulted Xiaomi intosecond place worldwide for wearable salesby 2015, behind onlyFitbit Inc(NYSE:FIT).The company pursued a strategy of investing in hardware startups, buying into dozens of companies making everything from smart lighting to headphones and TVs. While these products are not always Xiaomi-branded, they are designed to all work well together.It also added software and services to the mix.Chinese CompetitionThe success of Xiaomi spurred homegrown competition. Other Chinese manufacturers stepped up to the plate and followed Xiaomi's formula. However, they did a better job of marketing to increasingly demanding Chinese consumers by charging a little more but offering more striking designs. One of these companies -Huawei- was good enough that Googlepartnered with it to build the Nexus 6P smartphone in 2015. Xiaomi's phones seem lower quality than these competitors and rather than innovative, its designs are often seen as being too similar to Apple's.At this point, Xiaomi has been leapfrogged by its Chinese smartphone rivals. While Xiaomi has dropped off the global top five smartphone manufacturer list, China's Huawei,OppoandVivocurrently hold the third, fourth and fifth places.American ObstaclesKey to Xiaomi's ambitions were an expansion into the U.S. market. To lead that effort, thecompany hired Hugo Barra- the VP who oversaw Android product management - from Google.However, Xiaomi's U.S. push has failed to materialize. There are dozens of products Xiaomi offers online through itsMi Store(which carries only a fraction of Xiaomi's and its partner companies' gear), including eight different smartphone models, multiple smart TVs, VR headsets and even a self-balancing electric scooter. U.S. customers are limited to being able to buy a few sets of earbuds, a pair of headphones, a battery pack and a Bluetooth speaker.A big part of the problem in moving into the U.S. market is that Xiaomi has taken advantage of China's relatively lax approach to patents. In late 2014, it wasbanned from selling smartphones in Indiaas a result of a patent infringement ruling (it has since resumed Indian operations). If Xiaomi tried to push into the U.S. with its smartphones at this point, there's a good chance Apple and other tech companies would sue it into oblivion.In an attempt to defend against this scenario, Xiaomi has begun buying up patents. Last year,it purchased 1,500 patentsfromMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) relating to areas like wireless communication, multimedia and video, and the cloud.No Longer a Threat to Apple?At this point, Xiaomi is a paper tiger that isvalued at as little as $3.6 billion. In 2015, it sold 70 million-plus smartphones, missing its initial goal of 100 million and then the revised goal of 80 million. It's refusing to say how many it sold in 2016, but that silence speaks volumes.Hugo Barra bailed on the companya few weeks ago, joiningFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB). A few months before leaving, he toldReutersthat lower smartphone sales wouldn't impact the companybecause it made no money on them:""Basically we're giving [handsets] to you without making any money… we care about the recurring revenue streams over many years. We could sell 10 billion smartphones and we wouldn't make a single dime in profits.""The problem with that approach is that as of 2015,smartphones still accounted for 95% of the company's revenue. All those other products and services just don't seem to be sticking.Barra also told reporters not to expect Xiaomi to release a smartphone in the U.S. in 2017.3 Reasons Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Is Much More Than Its Main PlatformXiaomi CEO Lei Junposted a letter to employeeson Facebook in January. In it, he admitted the company had pushed ahead too fast, cutting into its long-term growth, but says the worst is over.The company's revenue target is RMB 100 billion (roughly $14.5 billion) -the same as its 2015 target. In trying to be so much, so fast, Xiaomi has set itself up for some very challenging times. If treading water is the goal it has set for itself, Apple doesn't have much to worry about.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace7 Tech Stocks With Explosive Growth PotentialThe Top 10 Dow Dividend Stocks for FebruaryThe postXiaomi Was Going to Rival Apple Inc.

Tech Companies Take a Stand Against Trump's Immigration Ban;2/6/2017;"Immigration has been a driving force behind many of the   leading technology companies in the United States.Some, includingMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) , are led by CEOs who were not born in this   country while over 200 companies on the Fortune 500 were started   by immigrants or their children. In addition most top tech brands   are global, with offices all over the world, and talent working   domestically that was not born in the U.S.At least partly because of that nearly 100 technology   companies including Microsoft,Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) ,Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) ,Facebook,Twitter, and many others have filed a legal brief in the U.S. Court of   Appeals for the 9th Circuit opposing President Donald Trump's   temporary immigration ban keeping people from seven predominantly   Muslim countries from entering the U.S. In the brief the   companies argue that the ban ""inflicts significant harm on   American business.""makeArticleAd();Trump signed an executive order banning immigration from     seven predominantly Muslim countries. Image source: Getty     Images.What are they opposing?In one of his first acts as president, Trump signed an   executive order banning refugees and visa-holders from seven   predominantly Muslim countries from entering the United States.   That order has been stayed by aU.S. District judgeand an appeals courtdeclined to immediately reinstatethe presidential order. The technology companies, many of which   operate and employ workers in and from the impacted countries   filed their brief to show their opposition to the president's   actions.""Immigrants make many of the Nation's greatest discoveries,   and create some of the country's most innovative and iconic   companies,"" the brief states. ""America has long recognized the   importance of protecting ourselves against those who would do us   harm. But it has done so while maintaining our fundamental   commitment to welcoming immigrants -- through increased   background checks and other controls on people seeking to enter   our country.""The companies that signed the brief acknowledged what Trump   was, at least on the surface, trying to accomplish with the   executive order.""We share your goal of ensuring that our immigration system   meets today's security needs and keeps our country safe,"" said a   draft of that letter obtained byBloomberg News. ""We are concerned, however, that your recent Executive Order   will affect many visa holders who work hard here in the United   States and contribute to our country's success.""Tech requires global talentPutting aside any political questions, the tech industry   opposes Trump's immigration ban in part because it takes global   talent to compete. The U.S. simply does not produce enough   workers -- specifically coders who write the software that powers   the products made by these companies -- to meet demand.To fill those needs companies across the U.S. use H1B visas to   receive special dispensation to hire workers who otherwise would   not be able to legally work in the country. A H1B visa, according   toMyVisaJobs.com, allows U.S. employers to temporarily employ foreign   professionals in specialty occupations for three years,   extendable to six years. ""To qualify for H1B Visa, the foreign   professional must hold a bachelor's or higher degree from an   accredited college or university in the specialty occupation,""   according to the site. In some cases specialized training can be   substituted for a degree.Technology companies dominate the list of employers using   workers on H1B visas. Data compiled by MyVisaJobs.com shows that   in 2016 Infosys held the top spot, having sponsored 25,405 visas.   while Microsoft, Apple, and Alphabet were all in the top 25.It's about more than self interestIt's easy to see the business reasons behind why these   technology companies oppose Trump's immigration restrictions.   Most, if not all of the companies that filed the brief would be   impacted by having employees unable to travel and in some cases   the executive order would impact hiring.For at least some of these companies, however, the opposition   goes beyond pure business logic. Many of these brands were either   founded by immigrants or by the children of immigrants and   immediate business concerns aside, they simply want a world where   new immigrants to the U.S. can be free to move here and found the   next Microsoft, Apple, or Alphabet.10 stocks we like better than MicrosoftWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Alphabet (GOOGL) to Sell Terra Bella Business to Planet Labs;2/6/2017;"Alphabet Inc.'sGOOGLGoogle announced on Friday that will sell its Terra Bella Imaging satellite business to Planet Labs.In exchange, Google receives a stake in planet and will also enter in to a multi-year contract to buy its Earth-imaging data.Google did not disclose the financial terms of the deal. Bloomberg had reported in January that talks were in progress between the two companies.For the last six months, Alphabet has outperformed the ZacksInternet-Servicesindustry. It has returned 1.87% compared with the industry's return of 1.17%.Formerly known as Skybox, the Earth imaging company was founded in 2009 and the search giant bought it for $500 million in 2014, the same year when Skybox was named no. 1 on Inc. magazine's 25 Most Audacious Companies. Google rebranded it to Terra Bella last year.In Quest of Financial DisciplineThe move underscores Alphabet's efforts to trim relatively less-revenue generating businesses and attain financial discipline. The company could save more by purchasing satellite imagery from a third party instead of operating its own imaging satellite business.Alphabet's sales, marketing and R&D expenses have gone up considerably in the last five years. There are also some other margin pressures. The most significant at the moment is related to currency, which continued to impact Alphabet's results despite the fact that it has a hedging program in place.Alphabet Inc. Total Expenses (TTM)Alphabet Inc. Total Expenses (TTM)|Alphabet Inc. QuoteOther expense pressures include fast-paced international growth, a growing volume of lower-priced YouTube clicks and strength of the mobile platform. So we believe that Alphabet has foreseen an escalation of costs in the years to come and is gearing up well in advance with decisions like these.The company has recently been getting rid of its audacious ventures. In Aug 2015, it reportedly curbed the expansion of its high-speed fiber optic Internet network, cutting 9% of its staff. In November, the company scaled back Project Wing, its experimental drone delivery program.Benefits for Planet LabsPrivately-held Planet Labs operates with dozens of small satellites that take pictures of the Earth surface frequently. However, the resolution of the images is low. Terra Bella has larger satellites with high image resolution but its fleet contains only seven satellites, which limits the frequency of capturing images.Thus, we believe that through this acquisition, Planet Labs will add high resolution satellites to its fleet. Both companies share the satellite imaging space with giants like Airbus Group'sEADSYAirbus Defence & Space and DigitalGlobeDGI.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, Alphabet is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.

Will Facebook Challenge Netflix and Amazon Via Set Top Boxes?;2/5/2017;"Facebook(NASDAQ: FB) is reportedly developing a dedicated video app for   set top boxes to  expand its social networking ecosystem   into living rooms, according to theWall Street Journal. The app will be different from its existing app for set top   boxes, which is basically just a widescreen version of its mobile   app.Image source: Facebook.makeArticleAd();Instead, the new app will mainly deliver videos from Facebook,   potentially turning it into a streaming rival toNetflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) andAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) . This supports previous reports that Facebook was   looking to license original content, and suggests that its users   could deliver live broadcasts to TVs via Facebook Live.Will this move pay off? Or are Netflix, Amazon, andAlphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) YouTube already too far ahead in   the video streaming wars?Understanding Facebook's video effortsYouTube is the biggest video streaming site in the world, but   Facebook's video ecosystem has been growing quickly. Last   January, Facebook revealed that  its users watched 100   million hours of videos per day. At the time,Business Insiderestimated that YouTube users were watching about 650 million   hours of video every day.During last quarter's conference call, Facebook CEO  Mark   Zuckerberg called video ""a megatrend on the same order as   mobile"", and highlighted the ways that video ecosystem was   expanding. It recently added a new tab in the Facebook app for   top videos and recommendations in the U.S., tested a version of   Live 360 videos for slower connections, and added live face masks   and camera effects. It also plans to invest more in original   video content to ""seed that ecosystem"" throughout 2017.Facebook's interest in videos makes sense, since video ads   cost much more than traditional display ads. As Facebook's active   user growth slows down, video ads can bolster its top line by   milking more ad revenue from existing users. Since nearly 94% of   Facebook's 1.86 billion monthly active users already access the    site from mobile devices, it also needs to look toward   other platforms -- like set top boxes -- to continue growing its   ad ecosystem.Carving out a niche between Netflix and AmazonAt first glance, it seems like Facebook could collide with   Netflix and Amazon's streaming video ecosystems. But Facebook   doesn't plan to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on big   budget shows likeHouse of CardsandMan in the High Castle.Instead, Zuckerberg plans to focus on ""shorter-form content to   start,"" noting that the videos will generally be split into   content people produce socially for friends, promotional content   from businesses and celebrities, and a class of Facebook-financed   ""premium"" content to differentiate it from other platforms. CFO   David Wehner was vague about what that premium content would   actually be, merely stating that the company was ""looking at a   wide range of content"" and ""working toward a revenue share model   with creators.""Those statements indicate that Facebook wants to carve out a   niche on set top boxes, instead of trading costly blows with   Netflix and Amazon. Since Facebook's video platform is all about   delivering ads, the platform should also be free -- so it won't   be competing for Netflix or Amazon's subscription-based   revenues.Is Facebook actually making a play for smart     homes?Facebook's new set top box app could also help it gain a   foothold in smart home ecosystems. Amazon has already established   a major presence in homes with its Kindle tablets, Fire TV set   top boxes, and Echo speakers. Google is trying to catch up with   Home, andAppletethers devices to its HomeKit platform for iOS.Facebook doesn't have an official horse in that race yet, but   Zuckerberg recently showcased Jarvis, a smart  home AI   platform he developed for his own home. The platform, which uses   voice commands to control devices, is controlled via a Messenger   bot.Image source: Facebook.By expanding Facebook's ecosystem to set top boxes like Apple   TV, Fire TV, and Roku, the social network couldpotentiallypiggyback off that hardware to sync with smart home devices. If   Facebook links Messenger to those ""hubs"", it could take control   of users' homes, gather even more data from those users, and   widen its moat against Amazon, Google, Apple, and other   challengers.The key takeawayFacebook's plans to expand its video ecosystem aren't   surprising, and a dedicated video app for set top boxes would be   the logical next step. It won't challenge heavyweights like   Netflix and Amazon, but it could capture a niche market of users   who want to view Facebook video content on a streaming platform   optimized for TVs. If the effort is successful, it could make its   video ads more valuable and give it a firm foundation for   eventually challenging other smart home players.Find out why Facebookis one of the 10 best stocks to buy nowMotley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent     more than a decade beating the market.

No, Google's Brand Is Not More Valuable Than Apple's;2/5/2017;"Last week, Brand Finance came out with itsannual listing of brand valuations. In a somewhat shocking finding, the consulting group declared   thatApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) had lost its supremacy toAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) subsidiary Google.Alphabet is a phenomenal company with a long track record of   innovation, and the Google brand is extremely powerful.   Nevertheless, it still isn't in the same league as Apple's brand   in terms of total value.Is Apple turning sour?While Brand Finance still rates Apple as the second most   valuable brand in the world, it appears to have a fairly negative   view of the iPhone maker. According to the recent report:makeArticleAd();However, Apple's evangelists are beginning to lose their     faith. The snaking queues of early adopters have shrunk almost     to the point of invisibility. Apple has failed to maintain its     technological advantage and has repeatedly disillusioned its     advocates with tweaks when material changes were expected.Put simply, Apple has over-exploited the goodwill of its     customers, it has failed to generate significant revenues from     newer products such as the Apple Watch and cannot demonstrate     that genuinely innovative technologies desired by consumers are     in the pipeline. Its brand has lost its luster and must now     compete on an increasingly level playing field not just with     traditional rivalSamsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) , but a slew of Chinese brands such as     Huawei and OnePlus in the smartphone market, Apple's key source     of profitability.As a result of this assessment, Brand Finance reduced its   estimate of the Apple brand's value by 27% year over year, to   $107.1 billion. Meanwhile, it estimated Google's brand value at   $109.5 billion, up 24% from $88.2 billion a year ago. Brand   Finance cited Google's dominance in search, among other things,   to justify the big increase in its brand value.Consumers are paying more and more for iPhonesBrand Finance's declining opinion of the Apple brand is   contradicted by consumers' willingness to pay more and more for   iPhones. Last quarter, Apple reported record quarterly iPhone   sales of 78.3 million units. Even more impressively, the average   selling price (ASP) reached a new record of $695.The iPhone's ASP hit a new record last quarter. Image     source: Apple.In the same quarter two years ago, right after Apple released   the hugely popular iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, the iPhone's ASP   had surged 8% year over year, to $687. Apple's ability to   continue growing that ASP over the past two years, despite facing   stiff foreign exchange headwinds in both years, is a testament to   the massive value of its brand.Indeed, the cost of high-quality smartphones is coming down.   Leaving aside Samsung, several Chinese manufacturers have become   known for designing high-quality smartphones and selling them at   near-breakeven prices in recent years. Apple's ability to command   a huge price premium over competitors -- which extends beyond   smartphones to PCs and (to a lesser extent) tablets -- indicates   that its brand is as strong as ever.Apple is a profit machineAccording to Brand Finance, Apple has failed to maintain a   technological lead over Samsung and other rivals. In fact, many   tech pundits have argued in recent years that Samsung has   overtaken Apple in terms of innovation.Assuming that the two companies are on a relatively even   technological footing, they should be able to produce roughly   similar earnings. However, that's not even close to being   true.Last quarter, Apple barely retook the lead in terms of   smartphone shipments with 78.3 million, compared to 77.5 million   shipments for Samsung,according to Strategy Analytics. Yet Samsung's mobile-division operating profit totaled just   $2.1 billion for the quarter. By contrast, Apple's operating   profit was more than 10 times higher at $23.4 billion.On a full-year basis -- or looking just at the smartphone   business -- Apple's advantage is somewhat smaller. But any way   you slice it, Apple generates many times more profit than   Samsung. (In its most recent fiscal year, Apple's operating   profit was $60 billion, compared to about $10 billion for   Samsung's mobile division.)If Apple doesn't have superior technology relative to Samsung,   its brand must be doing most of the heavy lifting to generate $50   billion of additional operating profit on an annual basis. That's   more than double Alphabet'stotalannual operating profit of $23.7 billion.Google may be a powerful brand. However, it doesn't come close   to the value of the Apple brand, which has turned the   traditionally low-margin technology hardware business into a   long-term cash cow that churns out tens of billions of dollars of   profit every year.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

How Profitable Is SpaceX, Really?;2/5/2017;"Last year, prior to the big SpaceXplosion -- which kind of     knockedSpaceX off the rails-- we spent a lot of time digging into SpaceX's finances.     We asked:How does SpaceX make money? And we answered the question: ""How profitable is SpaceX"" when it makes all that money?Much of this was based on educated guesswork, however, as we     extrapolated what we knew about the finances at SpaceX rivalsBoeing(NYSE: BA) ,Lockheed Martin(NYSE: LMT) ,Orbital ATK(NYSE: OA) , andAirbus(NASDAQOTH: EADSY) , and applied it to what wethoughtthat might mean for SpaceX's own finances. It would have been a     whole lot easier to just take a good hard look at SpaceX's own     financial documents, and get the answers straight from the     source.Lucky for us -- and for you --The Wall Street Journaljust did that.makeArticleAd();Here's your first look at SpaceX's CRS-8-mission rocket --     before it becomes the first ""reused"" orbital rocket in history.     Now let's take a look at SpaceX's finances. Image source:     SpaceX.In a detailed,multi-page expose, theJournalrevealed last monththat it has come into possession of a treasure trove of internal   financial documents from SpaceX. Combined with interviews of   ex-SpaceX staff, theJournalwas able to put together a pretty good picture of SpaceX's   finances.It isn't a pretty picture. Here's what we know.Wall Street Journalspills the beans on SpaceXSpaceX likes to portray itself as a growing rival to space   incumbents such as Boeing and Lockheed, Airbus and Orbital ATK.   But in fact, SpaceX's revenue growth halted --temporarily, we hope-- in 2014. Two failed space launches in the past two   years curtailed launch activity at the space start-up, with the   result that revenue actually peaked in 2014, at roughly $1   billion.SpaceX's sales then declined to just $945 million in 2015,   when the company conducted only six launches. (Revenue may have   grown again in 2016, or it may not have. The documents theJournalobtained apparently didn't extend into 2016.)What the documentsdoshow, though -- and show quite clearly -- is that no matter how   much revenue SpaceX records, it's not earning much profit from   that revenue.Dissecting SpaceX's financesAs revealed in theJournal's report, SpaceX turned just a small fraction of its $1 billion   in 2014 launch revenue into operating profit -- much lessnetprofit. The numbers aren't entirely clear from theJournal's chart, but appear to show SpaceX earning an operating profit   of perhaps 0.2% on $1 billion in revenue -- profitability far   below the 10%-ish profit margin that Boeing earns on its space   operations, or the 12.6% operating profit margin at Lockheed   Martin.That bleak situation got even worse in 2015 when a small   reduction in launch revenue sufficed to push SpaceX deeply into   the red, and forced the company to record a $260 million loss on   $945 million in revenue.What SpaceX hopes to earnSpaceX'ssuccessful return to spacelast month holds forth the promise that things will improve in   2017. Prior to the September SpaceXplosion, documents show that   SpaceX was targeting $1.8 billion in launch revenue in 2016, and   aiming to earn $55 million in profit thereon. While it probably   didn't get there in 2016, there's still a chance that it could   succeed in 2017 -- and achieve a 3% operating profit margin.And that's your answer right there: Currently, all indications   suggest that SpaceX isnotprofitable, but losing money. Only if things go well, and SpaceX   regains its footing in 2017, can we hope that the company will   achieve positive operating profit margins of 3%.Even if SpaceX succeeds at this, though, it would still be   earning only roughly half the 5.7% operating margin that Airbus   earns at its ""Defence and Space"" business (as reported byS&P Global Market Intelligence). SpaceX's targeted $55 million profit would also be a small   fraction of the $400 million in annual profit that the Boeing and   Lockheed joint venture ULAearns. On the other hand, SpaceX would eclipse thebreak-even profitsat Airbus' dedicated space launch subsidiary, Arianespace -- and   SpaceX could grow its profit margins in the future if its plans   to begin reusing relanded rockets, at lower cost than using   ""expendable"" rockets, pan out.SpaceX 2.0: A New HopeSo what's the upshot for SpaceX for investors who hope to one   day invest in its IPO, and for investors who already,today, own a piece of SpaceX through their investment inAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) stock? Simply put, the documents   theJournalunearthed show that SpaceX is not nearly as profitable an   operation as we once believed it to be..There's also a corollary conclusion, though, that affects   investors in the space industry in general. Lacking substantial   profits from its launch business, SpaceX is going to have a very   hard time financing atrip to Mars-- a voyage it hopes to makeas early as next year-- and a voyage that could inspire a whole host of   other companies to accelerate their own races to space.HowdoesSpaceX plan to fund its first trip to Mars in 2018 and the dozens   of follow-up trips it hopes to make in the years and decades to   follow? Tune back in next week for the answer.(But here's a hint:It will involve satellites.)10 stocks we like better than BoeingWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

These 2 Tech Companies Have Made the Most AI Acquisitions;2/4/2017;"Market-intelligence firm CB Insights has compiled alistof the major acquirers of private artificial-intelligence (AI)   companies over the last five years. This list reveals well-known   tech giants making large investments to increase their   capabilities in AI. It also provides insight into the evolution   of the technology, and its direct uses.Google and Intel are in the race for artificial     intelligence. Image source: Intel.makeArticleAd();Google's been on a buying spreeAlphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google is well known for itsaspirations in artificial intelligence; it heads the list with 11 acquisitions. A number of these   companies specialized in areas that led directly to recent   improvements in the Google Assistant. They also tie to the launch   of Google Home and its plans to take onAmazon's(NASDAQ: AMZN)Alexa virtual assistantand the Echo smart-speaker home system.The acquisition of Emu provided an assistant that used voice   commands to schedule appointments, set reminders, and make   reservations. Api.ai added tools for building conversational   bots, while Dark Blue Labs contributed natural-language   improvements. Two companies helped personalize recommendations:   Clever Sense learned about nearby coffee shops, restaurants and   bars; Jetpac searched for visual cues in photos to improve   recommendations. Timeful used priorities to add items to a   calendar using smart scheduling.Three companies specialized in image recognition: DNNResearch   focused on image search and facial recognition; Moodstocks   technology improved image recognition for smartphones; Vision   Factory worked to enhance accuracy and speed in object   recognition. Each of the aforementioned technologies serves to   improve specific functions in Google Home's ecosystem, and   specifically within Assistant. This will compete directly in the   virtual personal assistant market currently led by Amazon's   Alexa.London-based DeepMind was one of the largest acquisitions,   with a price tag estimated at $660 million. Google already   boasted a significant investment in the area with its development   of the Google Brain, a neural network developed in-house. Gains   in AI research have been used to improve many areas of its   current business. DeepMind is focused on improvements in general   AI research, without any specific business objectives. That said,   Google will use every opportunity to apply research gains to   business uses.Is Intel's acquisition of Nervana a threat to NVIDIA? Image     source: Intel.Intel will take the fight to NVIDIAIntel(NASDAQ: INTC) has made a number of acquisitions as well. Saffron   specialized in cognitive computing, combining data analytics with   deep learning; this relates directly to Intel's efforts in the   same area. Indisys provided natural-language recognition, gesture   recognition, and virtual-assistant technologies, but also created   user interfaces for unmanned drones. Itseez focused on software   for the Internet of Things (IoT), cameras, drones, and autonomous   driving. Movidius brought computer-vision hardware for drones and   cameras; it also provided system-on-a-chip (SoC) technology for   accelerating computer vision, as well as deep-learning   capability. These companies integrate directly into Intel's   RealSense brand for drones and virtual reality, and bolster its   IoT business.The most significant of Intel's acquisitions, however, may be   that of deep-learning start-up Nervana Systems. With a reported   price of $408 million, this company is attempting to reduce   machine learning to the size of a computer chip. Intel competitorNVIDIA(NASDAQ: NVDA) has seen its stock price triple in 2016, as its   graphics processing units (GPUs) become the chip of choice for   companiestraining AI systems. If Intel can succeed at reducing machine learning to a level   that could reside on a processor, that would be a significant   boost to its business and a potentially troubling development for   NVIDIA.As the battle for AI supremacy continues, we will likely see   more consolidation in the industry, as tech giants try to gain an   edge in this nascent technology. Success in the field will likely   depend on successful integration of these acquisitions into   existing business lines. Alphabet and Intel are on the right   track.10 stocks we like better than Alphabet (A     shares)When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

1 Thing NVIDIA Investors Should Worry About;2/3/2017;"WhenIntel(NASDAQ: INTC) acquired artificial intelligence (AI) start-up   Nervana Systems late last year, at first glance it appeared to be   another big tech company jumping on the AI bandwagon. A closer   look, however, reveals a very specific motivation. And it could   spell trouble for NVIDIA.NVIDIA GPU is the go-to chip to train AI systems -- for now.     Image source: NVIDIA.makeArticleAd();Intel has seen the market for its CPU chips shrink along with   the worldwide shipment of personal computers, which fell an   estimated 6% in 2016, the fifth consecutive year of declines.   CompetitorNVIDIA(NASDAQ: NVDA) , meanwhile, has seen the market explode for its   graphic processing units (GPU), along with its stock price, which   tripled in 2016.Though once used solely to render graphics in video games,   NVIDIA's GPUs have become the go-to chip fortraining neural networksdue to the massive parallel processing capability. According to aFinancial Timesarticle in December, NVIDIA ""is widely credited with having   developed the best chips for training the artificial neural   networks"". The use of NVIDIA GPUs by data centers -- many   training AI systems -- helped revenue nearly triple in the most   recent quarter, to $240 million from just $82 million in the   prior year. Intel dominates the non-AI data center market,   selling nearly 99% of server chips used, and it now has its   sights on the nascent AI market as well.What is Intel doing?Late last year, Intel announced that it would release a server   chip specifically designed for AI applications -- the Xeon Phi,   aka Knights Mill. It indicated this processor would run 2.3 times   faster than NVIDIA's GPUs when used for deep learning. NVIDIA   countered, saying Intel deliberately used outdated benchmarks and   older versions of its products in the comparison. It claims that   had Intel used the updated benchmark, NVIDIA's offering is 30%   faster, and that its latest processor is 90% faster.Intel wants to ""unleash the next wave"" in artificial     intelligence. Image source: Intel.Intel's recent acquisition pushes it deeper into this market.   Nervana Systems took a different approach in its AI research. It   has created an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) for   its AI research called the Nervana Engine. Certain elements in a   GPU needed for graphics processing are not necessary in an AI   application. By stripping out unnecessary elements and   reengineering the memory, Nervana claims it can achieve 10   times increases in the computing power currently available on   GPUs. In an article from October 2015,Barron's[subscription required] explained:Their chip has thousands of little logic engines sitting     next to pools of memory, with a plethora of connections between     them. They claim the chip can perform in a fraction of the time     an image-recognition task that would take an Intel server chip     2,000 hours, or an Nvidia GPU, 33 hours. The key is that they     are designing for specific algorithms, so the chip's design is     more efficient than a general-purpose chip like Intel's or     NVIDIA's.Nervana Engine ASIC chips are designed to accelerate AI     system training. Image source: Nervana Systems.Intel will be integrating the new technology into its existing   chips in early 2017, so expect new offerings that will directly   challenge NVIDIA's GPUs in the AI space. Intel also claims that   by 2020, it will be able to train AI systems 100 times faster   than with today's technology, thoughsomehave deemed those goals very aggressive.It's not the only oneAnd Intel isn't the only one claiming improvements beyond what   GPUs currently accomplish.Alphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google has been conducting   research in the field ofAI for over five years. It announced it has a Tensor Processing Unit -- which is also   an ASIC -- capable of delivering performance that is 10 times   faster than any GPU running today, and that it has been running   TPUs in its data centers for more than a year.  They were   also used in the AI system Alpha Go, which recently made   headlines bydefeating many top rankedGoplayers. This provides a degree of confirmation of Nervana's claims   regarding the potential of such custom circuits.NVIDIA sees AI as a billion-dollar opportunity, though   data center revenue amounted to only $240 million in its most   recent quarter.  Intel's revenue from data centers,   meanwhile, amounted to $4.7 billion in its most recent   quarter. This illustrates that while gains in the market   would barely move the needle for Intel, they could be a big mover   for NVIDIA. While GPUs currently hold a commanding lead in the   training of AI systems, that could change quickly if the   technological advances claimed by Intel came to fruition.10 stocks we like better than IntelWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Amazon (AMZN) Q4 Earnings Beat, Revenues Miss Estimates;2/3/2017;"Amazon.com'sAMZNfourth-quarter 2016 earnings per share (EPS) of $1.54 cents surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.40.However, revenues of $43.74 billion lagged the consensus mark of $44.87 billion. The stock was down 4.15% in Thursday's after-hours trading in response to the lower-than-expected revenues, higher operating expenses and weak guidance.Over the last one year, the stock has however outperformed the Zacks  Electronic Commerce industry. It has gained 56.63% compared with the industry's gain of 47.98%.Last quarter, despite an increase in operating expenses, the company showed much better financial discipline. The spike in operating expenses was due to buildout of fulfillment centers, and increased spending on original TV shows and movies. Amazon Web Services (AWS) and India expansion-related expenses also resulted in higher spending.The North America and AWS segments contributed to profits while investments in international continued. Improvements in AWS were the result of operating efficiencies and increased utilization of assets.The numbers in detail-RevenuesAmazon reported revenues of $43.7 billion, up 33.7% sequentially and 22.4% from the year-ago quarter. Quarterly revenues were at the mid-point of the guidance range of $42-$45.5 billion.For the full year, revenues were $136 billion, up 27% from $107 billion in 2015.Both product and service sales were up sequentially and year over year. Service sales grew much stronger than product sales from the year-ago quarter (up 43.7% compared with product sales growth of 15.1%). Revenue distribution between the two was 70%/30%.The company generated record sales during this year's holiday season, primarily led by its devices strategy. Echo Dot, Fire TV Stick, Fire tablet and Amazon Echo topped the best-sellers list.Segment DetailsThe North America segment accounted for around 60% of sales, representing a sequential and year-over-year increase of 39% and 22%, respectively. The International segment accounted for 32%, up 31.6% sequentially and 17.9% year over year. The AWS segment was up 9.4% sequentially and a massive 47% year over year with revenue share at nearly 8%.North America: Media was up 30% sequentially and 7.1% year over year. EGM was up 40.9% sequentially and 24.8% year over year. Other was up 42.6% sequentially and 80.4% year over year.International: Media was up 35.6% sequentially and 2.6% from last year. Sales from EGM were up 30.5% sequentially and 23.8% from last year. Other revenue was up 19.35% sequentially and 17.9% year over year.AWS: The business contributed $3.5 billion in the fourth quarter. AWS is gaining momentum with customers including McDonald's, Workday, Capital One, Salesforce, GE Oil & Gas, Kellogg's, Brooks Brothers, Ferrara Candy Company, GPT Group, Hoya Corporation, Lionsgate, Macmillan Publishers India, RWE Czech Republic, and Bart & Associates Inc. Amazon ended the quarter with 42 available zones across 16 infrastructure regions. The Mumbai (India) region was added in the third quarter, which became the sixth region in the Asia Pacific. Amazon remains the cloud infrastructure leader, well ahead of MicrosoftMSFT, International Business Machines CorporationIBMand AlphabetGOOGL.Gross MarginGross margin was down 122 basis points (bps) sequentially but up 189 bps year over year to 33.8%. Sequential variations in gross margin were largely mix-related, although increased investments were also a factor. Growth in AWS had a positive impact on margin. Pricing is also an important factor, given the increase in product categories all over the world and Amazon's strategy of heavily discounting products and services while building a position in any market. Third party sites did better than retail, which was also a positive.Gross profit dollars were up 29.8% from last year. The consistently rising gross profit dollars from the year-ago period reflects the success of Amazon's strategy.Net income was up 197.2% sequentially and 55.4% year over year.Operating MetricsAmazon's operating expenses of $13.5 billion were up 24.3% sequentially and 31.4% from the year-ago quarter. Amazon's heavy investing activities (headcount, fulfillment centers, content, etc) over the past few quarters have been driving up its costs. Cost of goods sold increased 121 bps sequentially as a percentage of sales with marketing expense increasing 45 bps and technology and content increasing just 5 bps. All other expenses declined as a percentage of sales.The net result was an operating margin of 2.9%, up 111 bps sequentially but down 23 bps from the year-ago quarter. Amazon reported an operating profit of $1.3 billion compared with $575 million in the previous quarter and $1.1 billion in the year-ago quarter.North America segment's operating margin of 3.1% was up 176 bps sequentially and 15 bps year over year. The International segment's operating margin of 4.07% shrank 315 bps sequentially but was up 100 bps from the year-ago quarter. Operating margin of AWS was 26.2%, down 46 bps sequentially but up 207 bps year over year.Consolidated segment operating income (CSOI) was up 111 bps sequentially but down 23 basis points from the year-ago quarter.Net IncomeAmazon generated fourth quarter net income of $749 million, or 1.7% of sales, compared with $252 million, or 0.8% in the previous quarter and $500 million, or 1.3% of sales in the same quarter last year. There were no one-time items in the fourth quarter. Therefore, the GAAP EPS was the same as the pro forma EPS of $1.54 compared with 52 cents in the previous quarter and $1 in the year-ago quarter.Amazon.com, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS   SurpriseAmazon.com, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS   Surprise|Amazon.com, Inc. QuoteBalance Sheet and Cash FlowAmazon ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments balance of $19.81 billion, down $146 million sequentially. The company generated $10.65 billion of cash from operations, spending $2.01 billion on fixed assets (including internal-use software and website development costs) and $3 million on acquisitions. Principal repayments of capital lease obligations were $1 billion in the fourth quarter.GuidanceManagement provided guidance for the first quarter of 2017. Revenues are expected to include a 250 bps positive FX impact and come in around $33.25-33.75 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $35.83 billion. Operating income is expected to come in at approximately $250-$900 million.To ConcludeRetail: Amazon's retail business remains very hard to beat on price, choice, convenience, you name it. The company has a solid loyalty system in Prime and its FBA strategy, and content addition continues to add selection to Prime memberships. If Amazon is able to replicate its domestic success internationally, investors could see far more growth. At the moment, international contributes a third of revenue but generates just a fraction of profits.AWS:Amazon Web Services on the other hand is the cash cow for Amazon. The business generates much higher margins than retail, so it has a positive impact on Amazon's profitability. We remain optimistic about the functionality, partner ecosystem and the experience AWS offers and believe this will lead to continued customer wins.IoT:Amazon has converted the nascent smart home market into a potential area of growth, in a very short time, backed by its Alexa-powered Echo devices. With third-party partnerships, Amazon is making Alexa the central point of connecting IoT devices used in any household. , It appears that Echo is well poised to penetrate every stream of business on the back of Amazon's robust performance.The company has accelerated signing on third-party device makers, so that these companies integrate Amazon's voice assistant - Alexa - which brings them into the respective eco systems.Currently, Alexa is equipped with thousands of skills and can connect to any stream of business. We believe that Amazon has just started to unfold what it could do with Alexa.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderCurrently Amazon has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Best Place to Start Your Stock SearchToday, you are invited to download the full list of 220 Zacks Rank #1 """"Strong Buy"""" stocks - absolutely free of charge.

Zillow In Position To Dominate Online Real Estate Ad Market;2/3/2017;"Zillow Group(Z), operator of the online house-hunting network that dwarfs all   competitors, has the inside track for winning a dominant share of   real estate agents' digital ad spending.""Their competitive position is quite strong,"" said Macquarie   Capital analyst Tom White.While the homes-for-sale data that underpins sites like   Zillow and Realtor aren't proprietary, White notes that   Zillow ""is out-innovating its competitors in augmenting that   basic listings data"" with other data, including listings of homes   not for sale, and by investing heavily in mobile.makeArticleAd();Citing comScore data, Zillow says its five brands account   for nearly two-thirds of the total online real estate   category and nearly three-quarters of the mobile segment.Yet White notes that there's ""a big disconnect"" between   Zillow's majority share of traffic and its slice of the real   estate advertising pie.Turning clicks into commission for agents and more ad dollars   for Zillow turns out to be easier said than done.Fast CompanyA partial explanation is that a big slice of real estate   advertising dollars is going to companies that aren't direct   competitors, likeFacebook(FB) andAlphabet's(GOOGL) Google.But the good news for Zillow is that it has been getting   better and better monetizing that traffic, growing sales by   upwards of 30% over the past year even as real estate agents have   lowered their overall spending on digital advertising.The bulk of Zillow's revenue - 70% in the last quarter - comes   from its Premier Agent program, where sales rose 32.5% from a   year ago. Real estate agents pay to have their picture,   credentials and ratings linked to Zillow's listings of homes for   sale, with up to four agents attached to each listing.Home shoppers who don't have an agent are likely to click on   those with high ratings and a history of similar   transactions, and that's exactly what Zillow wants to   see.Zillow has a strategy to help accelerate the real estate   industry's evolution to the survival of the fittest. Zillow is   looking to help the best real estate agents - the ones who   can best capitalize on the leads that Zillow generates and will   therefore pay the highest ad prices - to extend their   domination.[ibdchart symbol=""Z"" type=""daily"" size=""threequarter""   position=""rightchart"" ]""We are accelerating the broader trend   across the real estate agent population of higher-producing   agents gaining market share from those who are less productive,""   Chief Executive Spencer Rascoff said on a November   conference call with analysts.Agent OverhaulRascoff also noted that Zillow overhauled the ways it sells   ads to its Premier Agents last quarter. Under its old model,   Zillow came up with a price for a fixed number of ad impressions   based on a ZIP code's characteristics.But Rascoff noted that the fixed-price model sometimes sold   out impressions in desirable ZIP codes, requiring the company to   call up agents to increase ad prices. So now prices will be set   dynamically, based on the total dollars agents budget to   advertise on Zillow in a given ZIP code.The goal is ""to have the marketplace"" determine ad costs,   Rascoff told analysts.Zillow, which reports fourth-quarter earnings on Tuesday,   advised analysts on its November call that its guidance   carried an extra margin of error because of the nationwide   rollout of the new pricing strategy.Analysts expect the company to earn 11 cents a share vs. a   one-cent loss a year ago, as revenue rises 31% to $222 million.   In 2017 revenue is expected to grow 23% to $1.038 billion.Smaller Number, But Bigger SpendingThe number of agents advertising on Zillow declined modestly   in the third quarter to 89,147, but that was part of a planned   shakeout. At the same time, the number of advertisers spending at   least $5,000 per month rose 79% from a year ago, while average   spending per agent rose 46%.IBD'S TAKE:Zillow shares showed promise in early December, after     forming acup-with-handleand starting to break out. But shares retreated into a flat     base and remain there. Check out IBD Stock Checkup to see     the top companies in theInternet-Content group.Tuesday's results also will provide a checkup on two other new   initiatives: a partnership with Facebook and Zillow's first   effort to monetize the sell-side of the housing market.Zillow is partnering with Facebook to offer a precision-ad   targeting program that enables real estate agents to connect on   Facebook with home shoppers who are using its site or   Trulia, its sister property acquired in early 2015.Zillow also announced its Seller Boost program in October,   involving the placement of Premier Agent ads on listings of its   huge inventory of homes not for sale to provide potential   leads for agents if the homeowner decides to sell.Leveraging The NetworkAt the same time, Zillow is trying to leverage its large   network of users - 164.5 million in the seasonally slower   third quarter - to get a broader slice of advertising   dollars.Zillow's marketplace for mortgages, which connects homebuyers   to area mortgage lenders much likeLendingTree(TREE), generated $19.8 million in revenue in the third quarter,   up 57% from a year ago.The traffic at Zillow properties is roughly triple that of its   closest direct competitor, Realtor.com, which was acquired byNews Corp.(NWSA) in November 2014.Thanks to the merger with Trulia, Zillow removed a major   competitor. Meanwhile fears that News Corp. might jump-start the   growth and promotion of Realtor.com have been mostly   unfounded, Macquarie analyst White said.Bigger Slice Of PieBy some measures, though, Zillow has a growing slice of a pie   that has been shrinking in recent years. Borrell Associates   estimates that real estate agents spent $7.7 billion on digital   ads in 2016, down from $9 billion in 2014. Some 78% of real   estate ad spending was done online in 2016, Kip Cassino,   Borrell's executive vice president of research, told IBD.The decline in spending partly reflects a relatively modest   pace of home sales, especially among millennials, Cassino says.   The other reason is that agents ""have become more discerning   about how they spend,"" using Google keywords, social media or   unpaid search engine optimization strategies.Still, digital spending, including spending on related   technologies, has been growing as a percentage of agents'   marketing budgets, Zillow says.Rascoff's focus is making sure Zillow is ""well-positioned for   the billions of dollars of real estate agent ad spend which will   surely migrate on to the internet over the next couple of   years, and making sure that we've the right ad model to   capture the lion's share of that.""After several days of losses, shares of Zillow reversed course   late last week. The stock ended trading Friday up 1.6% to 35.93   and climbed another 1.9% Monday to finish the day at 36.62, right   on its 50-day moving averageRELATED:Analyst Sees 'Modest' Earnings Upside For     ZillowZillow Group Challenged By Rising Interest     Rates, Says StifelZillow Group Stock Turbocharged By     High-Spending 'Super Agents'"

How Social Media Changed Super Bowl Commercials Forever;2/2/2017;"In these times of deep political division, America's great unifier is visible on the horizon. Regardless of your partisan identity, race, ethnicity, or religion, if you live in the United States, you are probably going to watch the 51stannual Super Bowl this Sunday. Heck, even if you hate football, it is a great excuse to have some friends over and gorge yourself with French onion dip and potato chips.But what is more American than apathetic binge eating? Well, commercials of course! As if viewers were not satisfied with an hour-long, ultra-violent faceoff between the world's top athletes, the Super Bowl is traditionally paired with interesting and unique commercials to ensure that we do not take our eyes off the television for one second.It makes sense that a company would want to put their best advertisement out during the Super Bowl; the big game is always the most-watched television event of the year in the U.S., and based on last year's 112 million viewers, we can expect more than a third of the entire country to be tuned in on Sunday.(Also Read:51 Essential Houston Facts to Get You Ready for   Super Bowl LI)With that said, the advertising industry as a whole is not what it once was. Over the past decade or so, advertisers have been forced to adapt to new consumer behaviors, and that has meant the rise of viral marketing and digital ad campaigns.Super Bowl commercials have not been immune from these changes. Viewers simply do not want to miss any of the big commercials, and with plenty of trips to the fridge and bathroom on the average Super Bowl watcher's schedule, companies have started using the internet as a means of distributing their Super Bowl ads.While it is nothing new for Super Bowl spots to begin widespread circulation after the game itself, the latest phenomena has been the pre-releasing of commercials before the actual event. Many companies are now debuting their Super Bowl ads more than a week out from the game and pairing their release with a massive social media marketing campaign.Indeed, the rise of social media has coincided with an adapted Super Bowl commercial tradition. These days, companies want people to buzzing about their commercials well before they are set to debut. In fact, a recentNew York Timesarticlehighlights the fact that companies are spending even more money for online marketing on top of the cost of airing the commercial during the game.Mary Scott, a president at sports and entertainment marketing agency UEG, toldThe Timesthat she recommends clients spend at least 25% of the cost of the Super Bowl spot on their digital marketing rollout of the commercial.The cost of a 30-second advertisement during this year's Super Bowl rose to an astounding $5 million, and that means companies will want to get the most value for their investment. ""There's become more of a game around the game in terms of ensuring that really pays off in a big way,"" said Scott.""The game around the game"" that Scott is referring to includes massive social media exposure to the commercials in advance of the Super Bowl. For instance, a company may upload the spot to YouTube before spreading it around FacebookFBand TwitterTWTR.Social media also gives consumers new ways to react to the advertisements. Discussion about the spots plays out online, and it does not take much for these massive companies to become trending topics. Furthermore, Alphabet Inc.GOOGLis celebrating 10 years of YouTube's AdBlitz competition, a voting system that allows users to support their favorite spots.Some may argue that the pre-game debuts ruin some of the fun related to watching the Super Bowl, but if I point you to our piece that highlights some of the commercials that are already out, are you seriously not going to watch them? You are, and you can check them out here:Preview The Super Bowl Commercials That Are   Already Out.Personally speaking, I am happy about this trend. I plan on having some people over for the game this year, and it is always difficult to get people to stay quiet during the commercials, especially when the drinks start getting finished. I will be checking out as many as I can beforehand.Long-Term Buys You Won't See in the NewsThe stocks you see in today's headlines may not be in the news tomorrow or next week.

Google Earnings: The Market Has Made The Same Mistake Twice;2/2/2017;"Google Earnings (Shutterstock photo)As a general rule, the market is pretty good about learning from its mistakes. After all, there is nothing like a hefty loss to teach traders what not to do.That is a simple fact that must be borne in mind when looking for patterns in pricing; if the pattern involves a reaction to news that was ultimately proven wrong, it is unlikely to repeat very often, and the few opportunities when it does should be grabbed with both hands.makeArticleAd();That is what makes Google parent company Alphabet (GOOG:GOOGL) look like such a good buy after its reaction to Q4 earnings.As you can see from the chart below, prior to last week’s earnings report Google (I’m sorry but I just can’t bring myself to call the company “Alphabet”) had dropped sharply on earnings misses contained in two of the previous three releases, in April and October.On both of those occasions, though, the big drop in price was, with the benefit of 20/20 hindsight, an opportunity to buy the stock at a discount. There are different circumstances this time around, of course, but the dynamic that has made negative reactions to earnings in the past opportunities is still in place, so the end result is likely to be the same.The biggest problems with the Q4 results as far as traders were concerned, it seems, were that cost per click was down, and operating costs had risen to the point where earnings per Class A share (EPS) of $9.36 fell short of the Street’s estimates of around $9.64. Still, revenues of $26.06 billion beat the estimated $25.26 billion.There was also a concern lurking in the background regarding Google taking on both Amazon (AMZN)’s Echo and Apple (AAPL)’s iPhone with recent hardware launches. Google said that they were pleased with the reaction to both Google Home and the Pixel phone without going into specifics, but doubts about the wisdom of the strategy persist.I actually believe that Google has a chance of limited success in each case. The Pixel will be the most uphill struggle as the iPhone’s dominance of the mobile phone market is well established. Most estimates of sales of the phone so far are around 1 million, which hardly puts a dent in the iPhone, but may prove to be enough of a base to make the Pixel profitable as a niche product.Home has an easier, more logical path to success as Google is the natural choice of those looking for what is, essentially, a free-standing search engine.Ultimately, though, neither Home nor Pixel is going to be the driver of the recovery in the stock price that history suggests will come soon.First, the increase in operating costs that Google reported seems, on a breakdown of the numbers, to be the result of investment in the core business. Losses in what the company calls “Other Bets,” things like “Nest” and self driving cars, were actually reduced somewhat in the fourth quarter, but there was significant progress on the autonomous vehicle front.The possibilities of that field are endless and Google, along with Tesla (TSLA) and Apple, are generally seen as the leaders in driverless car research and technology.The other issue, of falling cost per click (CPC), is also not what it seems on the surface. It reflects a continuing move to mobile that results in that metric falling, but the volume of clicks increasing. The same issue was, in part, responsible for the April and October drops in GOOG after earnings, and the chart tells the story of how long it was until investors realized that volume more than offset falling CPC.Looking at Google’s results and the market reaction to them, I get a sense of déjà vu. We have actually been here before, twice, and each time the drop in GOOG gave investors a chance to buy cheaply. It seems that in this case the market is still learning from its mistake and over time the outcome here is most likely to be the same."

Domino's (DPZ) Expands Ordering Facilities on Messenger;2/2/2017;"One of the world leaders in pizza delivery and digital ordering platforms,Domino's Pizza, Inc.DPZ, is further expanding its digital ordering capabilities on Facebook Inc.'sFBMessenger.makeArticleAd();Until now, customers with a Pizza Profile were restricted to placing their most recent order or Easy Order via Facebook Messenger. Domino's went one step ahead by becoming the first national pizza chain to have full ordering capabilities on Messenger. Customers can now place any order for any menu item on the Messenger. Now, they won't need any Pizza Profile and can place orders through the company's enhanced ordering assistant bot - Dom.The enhancement comes just in time for one of the company's busiest day of the year - Football's final Sunday. Domino's expects sales to be five times more than on a typical Sunday. Thus, making ordering more convenient for customers could further add to the sales.The digital wave has hit the U.S. fast casual restaurant sector. Hence, an increasing number of restaurants are implementing technology to enhance guest experience. Similarly, Domino's is also investing heavily in technology-driven initiatives like digital ordering to boost sales. The company keeps on adding various ordering apps and platforms to its digital capabilities.In fact, Domino's lineup of AnyWare ordering capabilities currently has a total of 10 platforms that include Alphabet, Inc.'sGOOGLGoogle Home, Amazon.com, Inc.'sAMZNEcho, and ordering via a Pizza emoji on text.Notably, digital leadership is helping the company expand its brand in the domestic market as well as overseas. This is one of the reasons Domino's shares have widely outperformed the broader Zacks categorizedRetail-Restaurantsindustry over the past year. While the stock gained 50.3%, the broader industry declined 3.6% in the same time period.Although the company's initiatives such as implementation of technology and re-imaging of restaurants offer long-term advantages, the costs related to them are expected to continue dampening margins in the near term. Further, the company's wide international presence makes it highly vulnerable to foreign exchange headwinds, while a soft industry backdrop is putting pressure on the top line.Nevertheless, going forward, the extended ways to order a pizza are poised to keep Domino's in the forefront of digital ordering and customer convenience. Also, this should help in improving the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company's sales trends and enhance its competitive positioning.You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank   (Strong Buy) stocks here.Zacks' Best Private Investment IdeasIn addition to the recommendations that are available to the public on our website, how would you like to follow all Zacks' private buys and sells in real time?Our experts cover all kinds of trades… from value to momentum . . . from stocks under $10 to ETF and option moves . . . from stocks that corporate insiders are buying up to companies that are about to report positive earnings surprises.

Facebook (FB) Tops on Q4 Earnings Driven by Mobile & Video;2/2/2017;"Facebook, Inc.'sFBearnings streak continues with yet another better-than-expected quarterly performance. Facebook's fourth-quarter 2016 adjusted earnings of $1.24 per share and revenues of $8.8 billion easily topped the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.11 and $8.5 billion. This is Facebook's sixth successive quarter of earnings and revenue beat.Mobile and live video efforts are paying off big time for the social media giant. Instagram is also emerging as a major cash cow with over 500,000 advertisers. CEO Mark Zuckerberg continued to emphasize on bringing more and more video content on to the platform. It has been investing on original content and said that it will keep doing the same this year as well.As expected, Facebook continues to maintain a cautious stance on revenue and ad growth. Facebook again stated that ad revenues will continue to grow but will face tougher year-over-year comparisons in the current year. Moreover, as Facebook continues to ramp up investments, costs will increase. The company plans to go on a hiring spree this year and especially recruit engineers, which will further add to its costs. Well it's a no brainer that Facebook(or even any other company for that matter) will keep up with those dizzying initial growth rates as it gets bigger.Quarterly Numbers in DetailsFacebook reported non-GAAP earnings of $1.21 in the quarter, up 124% year over year. Revenues, excluding the impact of year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates basis, increased 51% year over year.Facebook's consistently expanding user growth remains one of its biggest growth catalysts.  Facebook's monthly active users (MAUs) were up 17% year over year to a staggering 1.86 billion. In addition, at the end of the quarter, mobile MAUs were 1.74 billion, representing 21% year-over-year growth. Daily Active Users (DAUs) were 1.23 billion, reflecting 18% growth year over year while mobile DAUs were 1.15 billion, up 23% year over year.Breaking down revenue components, advertising revenues were $8.629 billion, surging 53% year over year. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates, revenues from advertising also increased 54% year over year. Advertising revenues were driven by increasing mobile engagement, higher number of marketers, and continuing investment in new products.Mobile ad revenues in the quarter were $7.2 billion (up 61% year over year), contributing 84% to total ad revenues. Ad impressions grew 49%, driven by surging mobile ad impressions. Average price per ad increased 3% from the year-ago quarter. Average revenue per user was $4.83Payments and other fees decreased 12% year over year to $180 million in the reported quarter owing to a reduction in payment revenues related to PC games. Management expects revenues from this segment to face further decline as PCs lose market share.On the cost front, cost & expenses increased 29.3% to $4.2 billion, driven by increases in workforce and marketing expenses. However, robust revenue growth provided enough cushion to operating margins.Non-GAAP operating income of $5.6 billion grew 58.9% year over year.Facebook, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS     SurpriseFacebook, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS   Surprise|Facebook, Inc. QuoteBalance Sheet & Cash FlowFacebook exited the quarter with cash & cash equivalents and marketable securities of $29.4 billion, up 59.7% year over year.The company generated nearly $16.1 billion of cash flow from operating activities in 2016 compared with $10.3 billion in 2015. Free cash flow was $11.6 billion compared with $7.8 billion last year. The company incurred capital expenditure of $4.5 billion in the year.OutlookNon-GAAP expenses are projected to increase in a band of 47% to 57% while capex is expected to be $7 billion to $7.5 billion. The company expects 2017 to be a year of aggressive investments. The company plans to build more data centers as well as recruitmore engineers to fuel its AI & AR/VR technology ambitions.Stock-based compensation is estimated in a range of $3.9 billion-$4.1 billion. The company expects amortization expenses in 2016 to be within $700 million-$800 million.Final WordWe remain positive on Facebook as it works on becoming a tech powerhouse. Its chief Mark Zuckerberg aspires to make Facebook much more than just a social media platform.  Last year, we got a glimpse of what Zuckerberg intends to do. He is betting big on AR/VR. At the company's Oculus Developer conference held in October last year, Facebook announced another $250 million investment to develop VR content ecosystem. It also announced some new products including Santa Cruz, a cheaper standalone VR headset with inside-out-tracking.AI and AR/VR technology are fast emerging as lucrative business opportunities.  According to a recent IDC report, global revenues of the AR/VR market are expected to grow at a CAGR of 181.3% from $5.2 billion in 2016 to over $162 billion in 2020. Recently, Facebook split Oculus into two separate units. While one division will focus on developing VR for mobile, the other one will focus on VR for PCs. He has roped in Hugo Barra to spearhead the company's VR efforts as well as head Oculus. A few days back, Facebook said that it will spend over $3 billion in the next 10 years on VR.However, a couple of days back, Facebook was ordered by a Dallas court to pay $500 million to ZeniMax for copyright infringement. ZeniMax has slapped a $2 billion lawsuit against Oculus accusing it of stealing its intellectual property to boost its own VR research.The company is also aggressively working on monetizing its subsidiaries, Messenger, Oculus and WhatsApp. Chatbots and ""conversational commerce"" are likely to be the strategies for Messenger and WhatsApp.It is also making its presence felt in enterprise software by launchingWorkplace. Facebook also upped its ante in the social commerce area with the launch ofMarketplace. It also acquiredNascent Objectsto boost its hardware efforts.However, Facebook was criticized for the dissemination of fake news on its platform, which said to have one of the reasons behind Donald Trump's win. Facebook has since then taken initiatives to curb the menace. It is availing the help of third parties for better verification of news and also considering the option of ""labeling stories"" that are flagged. Facebook said it will also scrutinize ads that promote bogus stories for monetary gains. Lastly, it said that it will work with the entire news industry to improve its fact checking systems.As of now, all of these appear to be terrific growth engines but it will be one Herculean task for the company to actually make all of it work. Moreover, intensifying competition for users & ad dollars from the likes of AlphabetGOOGL, Snapchat and Twitter Inc.TWTR, and increasing investments threaten to thwart its growth prospects.At present, Facebook carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Given the phenomenal growth in mobile ad business and video efforts, Facebook has vastly outperformed the broader market. In the past one year, Facebook's shares have generated a return of 18.89%, compared with the ZacksInternet Servicesindustry's gain of 4.43%.A stock worth consideration in the tech space is Jabil Circuit IncJBL, which carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Better Buy: Facebook, Inc. vs Alphabet;2/1/2017;"Digital advertising is expected to surpass television   advertising in the U.S. this year -- that is, if it hasn't   already. The two main beneficiaries of the growth in digital   advertising areFacebook(NASDAQ: FB) andAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) , which owns Google.Image source: FacebookmakeArticleAd();Indeed, the two companies completely dominate the digital   advertising market, combining to take about 60% of the market.   Both companies are growing rapidly, especially considering their   size, but which is the better buy right now?A look at valuationBoth Facebook and Alphabet trade for relatively high   valuations, which would leave them off the buy list of many   investors. But both companies arguably deserve their high   valuations because of their rapid growth and the industry trend   supporting them.CompanyP/E (forward)P/S (TTM)P/FCF (TTM)PEGFacebook24.915.243.20.95Alphabet20.06.824.81.06Source: Yahoo.Investors are valuing Facebook's expected earnings and   earnings growth near the same levels as Alphabet, but that puts a   premium on Facebook's trailing-12-month sales and free cash flow   compared to Alphabet's.Facebook does sport a significantly larger operating margin   compared with Alphabet (45%, versus 26% in the third quarter),   which makes its sales more valuable, but no more than twice as   valuable. Likewise, Facebook's free cash flow doesn't deserve to   be given nearly twice the value as Alphabet's.For investors looking for a growth stock with a good   valuation, Alphabet shares definitely take the title here.Image source: AlphabetWhat about growth?A great growth stock, however, will produce significant   earnings growth for its shareholders. You'll notice the one   valuation where Facebook outshines Alphabet (albeit just barely)   is in its PEG ratio -- the only metric shown that accounts for   growth.Indeed, analysts expect Facebook to continue growing rapidly   over the next five years, with a compound annual earnings growth   rate of 35.5%. Analysts expect Alphabet to produce EPS growth of   just 18.6% on average through 2021. That's nearly half the rate   of Facebook's growth -- and that's what you get for the premium   price you'll pay for Facebook.Facebook's management recently warned that advertising revenue   growth on its flagship platform will slow about midway through   2017, but it still has several other major potential revenue   drivers.Instagram is still in the early days of advertising, and   analysts at Credit Suisse estimate it could generate $6.4 billion   in 2017 (double 2016) and $12 billion by 2021. For reference,   Facebook is expected to produce $27.3 billion in sales this   year.Facebook's Oculus just started selling hardware a bit over a   year ago, and Mark Zuckerberg expects VR to be the next big   computing platform. Not to mention Facebook has 1 billion users   for both Messenger and WhatsApp left to monetize.Meanwhile, Alphabet's growth will come mainly from the   continued trend of growing digital advertising spend, which   largely benefits Google.

Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock Won’t Stop at $12;2/1/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOnce left for dead, semiconductor giantAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMD), has come back over the past two years, proving the doubters wrong. With gains of 400% over the past year, AMD stock haspunished those who bet against it. But is it now time to take profits?makeArticleAd();Source:Matthew Rutledge via FlickrNope.AMD stock had a slow start to 2017, off about 6% before Tuesday night's fourth-quarter earnings report, is back in the black thanks to a Wednesday surge after showing off some of the operational dominance it sported in a rip-roaring 2016.Expectation for the QuarterFor the quarter that ended December, Wall Street expected the company to report a loss of 2 cents per share on revenues of $1.07 billion. AMD beat on both fronts, recording revenues of $1.11 billion and a loss of just 1 cent per share.Recent results fromIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) hinted that Advanced Micro might be in for a Street-beating quarter.7 Stocks to Buy That Could Double by 2018On Friday John Vinh, analyst at Pacific Crest noted that Intel's results, which reflected less-bad personal computer trends, suggests strong growth for the sector. Notably, Vinh cited AMD as benefiting from ""strength in gaming and high-end PCs."" To that end, the analysts also said the improvements in high-end PCs could reduce concerns about high-end GPU inventory at desktop graphics card manufacturers.Well, a beat is what we got, and that came on the power of AMD's graphics chips, which saw revenues grow 15% year-over-year.The Key to AMD: GPUsGPU, or Graphics Processing Unit, is a big business for AMD. Those chips render images, animations and video for display on computer's screens. And the strength of that business has been a key component of AMD's turnaround. In the third quarter, reported in October, AMD posted a 23% year-over-year jump in revenue of $1.3 billion. The company benefited from strong growth in its popular Radeon line GPUs as revenue from that segment rose 11% year over year.This quarter, GPUs helped once more. Revenues in Computing and Graphics grew 28% year-over-year, thanks in part to higher average GPU selling prices.The company recently announced that its FirePro server GPUs have been selected byAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL) to power its cloud platform in 2017. All told, AMD's GPU strength has begun to gain traction in different verticals, which should help it narrow the market share gap with leaderNvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA).Bottom Line for AMD StockAMD's report was full of other positives, such as an expansion of gross margins from 30% to 32%, and slight gains in its Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom business (4%).Still, graphics and high performance are the name of the game.AMD stock surged 14% higher on Wednesday's reaction to fourth-quarter results, putting shares at highs last seen in 2017. The stock has returned more than 400% in 12 months - better than the 20% one-year gain in theS&P 500.And even still, AMD is showing that there's little let-up in the growth ramp.I expect AMD stock to reach $13 in 2017, delivering 22% gains on the back of greater GPU adoption and rising margins.As of this writing, Richard Saintvilus did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceWill the Apple Inc.

Facebook Inc (FB) TV App Is More Trouble Than You Think;2/1/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) opened for trade Feb. 1 at an all-time high - a market cap of $365 billion - on the strength of its dominance in mobile apps. But the big news is that Facebook is about to challenge the video league leaders with a mobile app for existing streaming boxes like theApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) TV. The question is, what will this do for FB stock?makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockMoving into TV through an app rather than a device makes sense, given the failure of the original Facebook phone and its overwhelming success with apps for others' phones.FB is already bankrolling the creation of videos for the video tab of itsmobile app.So where does Facebook fit its service into the evolving market, and what does its presence as a broadcaster mean to its claims not to be a media company?FB Stock: TV vs. PhoneThe company is already a presence in video thanks toFacebook Live, which allows live streaming of video on the service and it has aPresidential endorsement.10 Stocks to Buy That Already Make America GreatFB has prepared to offer longer videos by introducing ""mid-roll"" ads - ads that play in the middle of a video - to its line-up, making the service more TV-like.Over time, this might allow Facebook to compete directly withAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN),Netflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX) andAlphabet Inc's(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) YouTube in the growing market for streaming services.The problem is that there is a big difference between the experience you get on a mobile phone and what you want on a TV screen. A phone is active, a TV is passive. A phone may support videos of a few minutes, while people will watch TV for hours-and-hours.There is an assumption in the breathless reporting of Facebook's latest move that TV is easy; that it's just something you throw money at. Given the success of Netflix in generating subscribers and Emmys, and Amazon in generating Prime members and Oscar buzz, that is an easy mistake to make.Worth the Candle?For Facebook stock, this may not be as huge a deal as analysts think.Netflix revenue is only a fraction of FB stock's. Analysts expect Facebook to deliver over $27 billion in 2016 revenue when it reports after the market closes Feb. 1. This is against roughly $9 billion for Netflix. NFLX also brings just 3% of that revenue to the bottom line, while FB stock brings nearly one-third of revenue to its net income line.Entering the world of creating television poses another risk. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has repeatedly saidhe doesn't run a media company, that his is just a communications service. Media companies have responsibilities to truth and accuracy that, say, phone companies don't have - responsibilitiesthat can limit profitability.If Facebook is going to license content from media suppliers, whether live or scripted, it becomes a media company, subject to political and public scrutiny for its programming choices, on a global basis. This is a dance FB stock shareholders should fear, because it costs money to play, and carries risk.Can Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Jump Over These Hurdles?But Facebook may now have no choice in the matter. The big screen is the last frontier for internet services, it's where everyone is heading. FB stock does not want to be left behind.The Bottom Line on Facebook StockWhile most analysts are jumping for joy over the Facebook TV app news, I am a lot more cautious. This move has enormous implications for the entire company, for how it's perceived and (more important) what it costs to run.FB, like Alphabet, prefers to manage itself through algorithms. Algorithms scale in ways people do not. Facebook is starting to bow to pressure on the media front,hiring Campbell Brownto coordinate media alliances. Now it's about to become a TV network, or at least a streaming service.What will that mean to its profitability and growth? I think they both slow, because people aren't algorithms and talent has temper that code does not have. Politics can kill the media star.Dana Blankenhornis a financial and technology journalist.

Will the Apple Inc. HomeKit Beat Amazon’s Alexa? (AAPL);2/1/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) announced HomeKit - its strategy for becoming the center of the smart home - in June 2014.Amazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) revealed its Alexa-powered Echo smart speaker that November.makeArticleAd();Source: Apple/AmazonWhile there are currently several dozen HomeKit compatible smart home products, Amazon's Alexa is now connected to thousands of smart products and services and has spread from the Echo to third-party devices.On the surface, it looks as though Amazon has outmaneuvered and thoroughly trounced Apple. But despite the seemingly insurmountable lead and momentum, AAPL could still end up beating AMZN in this smart home race.Here's how.Apple Chose the Closed Approach With HomeKitApple tends to be extremely cautious. Its software is designed to be user-friendly and secure. iPhone apps can't just be downloaded from anywhere; they need to go through the official App Store and that requires approval by AAPL. Third-party hardware needs to be certified by Apple before it can be marketed as being iOS-compatible.It's that ""walled"" approach that hasmade the iPhone more securethan smartphones runningAlphabet Inc's(NASDAQ:GOOGL) Android operating system.With the iPhone and Siri - Apple's voice assistant - at the center of Apple's smart home strategy, that focus on security, compatibility and ease of use carried over toHomeKit. Manufacturers who want to make their smart devices HomeKit-compatible face a daunting series of requirements.Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Has a New Hero: Services!As pointed out in a recent Reuters article ondiffering smart home approaches, this includes being forced to buy a special HomeKit chip, being limited to approved (and more expensive than average) Bluetooth and Wi-Fi chips and even extends to manufacturing being limited to factories that are certified by Apple. End-to-end encryption is mandatory. Once a HomeKit product is ready, it faces extensive testing by Apple engineers to ensure compatibility.Thenit may be sold. That process alone can take three to five months.So you have additional costs, the procedural red tape and a delay. It's easy to understand whyApple currently lists only 75 or so HomeKit-compatible devices. And half of those are either different color options or regional variations of the same product.Amazon Alexa Is Open for BusinessAmazon took a radically different approach with its Echo speaker and Alexa. The company openly courted third-party companies to develop Alexa ""skills"" or software-enabled interactions with an Amazon Alexa-powered device.A skill can be the ability to tell Alexa to order anUber. It could also be telling Alexa to turn on your home's smart lights or to start your electric car. The process is simple. Amazon provides an example showinghow to build an Alexa skill in 60 minutes, and that includes the time needed to create a developer account. Submit the skill to AMZN for a quick verification, and it's published.That's how Amazon Alexa tripled its available skills in just three months last year, hitting 3,000 in September. If that sounds impressive, by CES 2017 in January, it had hit more than 7,000 Alexa skills.In addition to skills, Amazon also encourages third parties to integrate Alexa functionality into their products. That way, consumers get the Alexa experience without requiring an Echo speaker.That's a far easier process than Apple HomeKit certification. A ""Works with Alexa"" label takes about 10 days to obtain (it can even be issued by third party labs) and doesn't require special chips. According to the Reuters post, that has resulted in over 250 products that are Alexa-certified. We saw some of these at CES, including third-party speakers with Alexa and even home appliances with built-in Alexa capability.Smart Home Security: Apple Strength, Amazon Alexa VulnerabilityThe differing approaches of AMZN and AAPL have led to Alexa rapidly leaping to a massive lead over HomeKit in the smart home. However, there is one scenario where this could change rapidly.Security is increasingly becoming an issue for smart, connected devices. Apple's HomeKit approach emphasizes security, to the point of forcing the use of specialized chips and even certified manufacturing facilities.Amazon's Alexa strategy, on the other hand, leaves its platform relatively exposed. Amazon told Reuters it can't guarantee the security of third-party devices running Alexa. Those thousands of Alexa skills also integrate with third-party services that may have their own vulnerabilities.Trade of the Day: Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock No Longer a Home RunAll it would take is one catastrophic hacking for a PR disaster that turns consumers off Alexa. As CNET puts it in a review of thehacking risks for different smart home standards: ""Don't assume that a device has high security standards just because it works with Alexa.""Bottom LineThere's no disputing the fact that Amazon completely caught Apple and others off guard with its stealthy approach of sneaking Alexa into the home using its Echo connected speaker.Before the Echo, it was generally assumed that a smartphone would be the natural smart home controller. Making Alexa integration so open has also paid off for AMZN, resulting in a formidable lead in the smart home in a very short time. That lead may well turn into complete domination of the connected home. But Amazon's open approach may also prove to be its Achilles heel.Should hackers turn their attention to Amazon Alexa, the resulting headlines may flip the equation and put the much more secure Apple HomeKit on top in the long run.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceApple Inc.

What Apple's (AAPL) Earnings Say About The Future;2/1/2017;"When you regularly give your opinion on something as unpredictable as financial markets, gloating when you get something right is rarely a good idea. That is especially true when those opinions arearchivedfor all to see; it's too easy for a reader to check out that archive and find examples of when the market and hindsight combine to make even logical arguments seem foolish. I am fully aware of that, but when it comes to yesterday’searnings release from Apple(AAPL), I will still say""told you!""What really matters about the Apple release to investors is certainly not that I got it right, nor is it even that the tech giant returned to growth in revenue for the first time in a year, nor that the already great margins at Apple increased. Those last two are important, but necessarily backward looking, as all hard data in an earnings release are by definition.What matters most is what the report tells us about the future and there the message was somewhat mixed.makeArticleAd();The official guidance for Q1 2017 contained in the release fell just short of Wall Street’s expectations, which would normally be enough of a negative to more than offset the good historical results. In this case, though, a look at where Apple succeeded in Q4 2016 suggests that that guidance may just be another example of Apple’s past tendency to err on the side of under-promising and over-delivering when it comes to guidance. That is why, even though growth stalled last year, AAPL has beaten EPS expectations in three of the last four quarters.First and foremost, iPhone sales hit another record. That is particularly significant as not that long ago many were predicting that Google parent Alphabet (GOOG:GOOGL)’s move into the phone business would do Apple some serious harm. It looks now as if those saying that were about as accurate as those that maintained that the Windows phone from Microsoft (MSFT) or the Amazon (AMZN) Fire phone would be the next big thing.The fact is that the iPhone has an iconic status that looks almost impossible to challenge. Even phones that are objectively better in some ways, such as memory capacity, camera resolution, or speaker quality for example, cannot take market share. As Apple advances the iPhone with each release, beating them on those and other fronts becomes harder, but remains, according to the evidence so far, a pointless exercise. As long as that dynamic remains, holding Apple stock and adding to holdings at times of weakness still makes sense for investors.The weakness in this release was mainly in one area; iPad sales declined for the twelfth successive quarter. That, however, was offset to some extent by strong sales of Macs and Apple Watches. For the latter we are reliant on the word of Tim Cook as Apple doesn’t release a breakdown of watch sales, but, as I pointed out in the article referenced above, anybody who tried to buy a Series Two watch as a Christmas gift is probably aware that sales were at least more than Apple expected. None were available in any of the five states where I tried and most stores have just now received inventory.That shortage of watches, combined with Cook’s admission that they seriously underestimated demand for the iPhone 7 Plus, means that the record sales reported yesterday were achieved with a background of supply constraints. Given that and the fact that there was considerable growth in areas such as services and enterprise operations that still have lots of room for Apple to expand, the message underlying yesterday’s earnings is that, despite conventional wisdom, growth can still be achieved."

However, revenues decreased 15.4% sequentially, primarily due to seasonally soft sales figures for its semi-custom System on Chips (SoCs). Notably, revenues were well above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.07 billion.AMD's shares rose 1.2% in after-hour trading. We note that shares have outperformed the ZacksElectronics Semiconductorsindustry over the last one year. While the industry gave a positive return of 67.2%, AMD gained a whopping 384.6%.The company benefited from strong demand for its graphics products. However, AMD's first-quarter 2017 will be impacted by seasonal weakness.RevenuesAdvanced Micro has two reportable segments -Computing and Graphics(focused on the traditional PC market) andEnterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom(focusing on adjacent high-growth opportunities). The details of these segments are discussed below:Computing and Graphics includes desktop and notebook processors and chipsets, discrete GPUs and professional graphics. This segment accounted for 54.2% of revenues and was up 27.1% sequentially and 27.7% year over year to $600 million.Notably, this segment's revenues grew on an annualized basis for the first time since 2011 as AMD's increased efforts to strengthen this particular segment paid off.Also, the segment posted the highest revenue in the last two years. Client revenues were the highest in the last seven quarters. Graphics processor revenues were also the highest in the last 11 quarters.During the reported quarter, strong adoption of the company's seventh generation notebook accelerated processing units (APUs) drove growth for the company. While desktop processor sales improved on a sequential basis, it declined on a year-over-year basis.The company also won a number of high-end design deals with global original equipment manufacturers over its Ryzen desktop processor that is expected to be launched in early Mar 2017.AMD's Polaris line of GPUs witnessed increased adoption in the fourth quarter. Also, Radeon Pro 400 mobile GPUs were launched, which are used in Apple'sAAPLpremium segment notebooks.The Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment includes server and embedded processors, dense servers, semi-custom SoC products, engineering services and royalties. This segment brought in the remaining 45.8% of revenues, down 39.4% sequentially but up 3.7% year over year to $506 million.The year-over-year increase was driven by higher sales of embedded processor sales and game consoles by MicrosoftMSFTand Sony that are powered by AMD's chips.The segment witnessed increased adoption in targeted markets.

As more and more devices become interconnected, Advanced Micro's efforts to further strengthen its position in the burgeoning embedded markets will reap benefits. (Read:AMD and Mentor Graphics Ink Deal on Embedded Technology).Google DealIn November, the company announced that its FirePro server GPUs have been selected by AlphabetGOOGLto power its cloud platform in 2017. These developments are expected to help the company gain more traction in the GPU space and close in the market share gap with NVIDIA. (Read:AdvancedMicro Scales New Highs, Clinches Deal with Google).Balance SheetAdvanced Micro exited the fourth quarter with cash and cash equivalent balance of $1.26 billion, up $6 million from the previous quarter.During the quarter, the company raised approximately $1.4 billion in cash, before issuance costs, as a result of issuing $690 million of common stock and $700 million of Convertible Notes due 2026.Inventory was $751 million, up 10.8% on a year-over-year basis but down 2.7% sequentially. Total debt (short term and long term) was $1.43 billion, down $0.2 billion sequentially.GuidanceManagement expects first-quarter 2017 revenues to decrease 11% sequentially (+/- 3%), primarily due to seasonal weakness in semi-custom and graphics products. If the company manages to achieve the mid-point of its guidance, it will translate to 18% growth in revenues on a year-over-year basis.Gross margin is likely to be 33% while non-GAAP operating expenses are estimated to be $360 million.On the other hand, interest expense, taxes and others will amount to $30 million. Inventories are expected to remain flat on a sequential basis.Our TakeThe decent fourth-quarter results reflected AMD's improving position in key markets with the introduction of several APUs and GPUs. Moreover, partnerships with the likes of Google for the supply of Radeon Pro GPUs and FirePro server GPUs are positive in our view.Notably the company trails NVIDIA as the second-largest manufacturer of graphics chips for high-end computing and is gradually gaining traction in the space.Additionally, upcoming products like Ryzen and Zen are expected to drive the top line going ahead.Zacks RankAdvanced Micro has Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank stocks here.Zacks' Top 10 Stocks for 2017In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2017?Who wouldn't?

Amgen, Inc. (AMGN) Q4 Earnings Preview;2/1/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAs it's customary withAmgen, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMGN), the biotech giant topped analysts' expectation in each of the first three quarters of 2016. Chances are that it'll top expectations once more when it reports its fourth-quarter and full-year 2016 figures on Feb. 2. So if you're following AMGN stock, you don't need to worry about Amgen's profits.makeArticleAd();Source:Richard Masoner via FlickrInstead, you'll want to watch the following items Thursday when Amgen reports its fourth-quarter results:#1: Enbrel Sales TrendCompared to the third quarter of 2015, Amgen reported flat product sales in Q3 2016. This was mostly due to its top-selling drug, Enbrel, losing ground. Sales for the drug had increased 24% in Q1 and 10% in Q2, but in the third quarter, total Enbrel sales were $1.452 billion, versus $1.459 billion in the year-ago period.The problem doesn't seem to be seasonal fluctuation, considering that Enbrel sales grew by 30% in Q3 2015, compared to Q3 2014.7 Awful Stocks You Need To Ditch Right AwayThe problem is that competition is catching up. Amgen usually says, ""offset partially by the impact of competition"" when giving details about Enbrel sales. However, in Q3 2016, ""partially"" was conspicuously absent. Did someone just forget to copy-and-paste? Maybe. Maybe not.AMGN stock holders should pay attention to see if Enbrel will resume growth through increased volume, as opposed to price hike.Enbrel faces three major growth barriers.First, it competes againstAbbVie Inc's(NYSE:ABBV) Humira and Johnson & Johnson's Remicade. This leads to the second challenge.Stiff competition necessitates incremental rebates to payers to maintain its formulary position.The third challenge is the biosimilar availability. For instance, the FDA has approved Erelzi, an Enbrel biosimilar byNovartis AG (ADR)(NYSE:NVS).Put simply, further lackluster Enbrel growth would weigh on AMGN stock.#2: Amgen's Drug PricingInvestors also should look closely at how fast Amgen is hiking prices.I raised concerns about Amgen stockgrowing sales by increasing drug prices, instead of higher volumes, after the company reported its Q2 2015 earnings. Almost two years on, the trend of growing sales with price hikes is still commonplace at AMGN.From a business perspective, it's smart to try to squeeze out every possible dollar from your inventions. However, the U.S. government is standing up against it. President Donald Trump told drugmakers in aJan. 31 meetingthat ""we have to get the prices down.""This won't be good for the top and bottom lines of any drugmaker. However, for a company who thrives on hiking drug prices like AMGN, the downside gets bigger.#3: How Did Repatha Perform?Repatha is heralded as potentially one of Amgen's best sellers. The company said the drug caters to ""serious diseases with significant unmet needs."" However, it brought in a meager $40 million in Q3.One barrier to market growth is that payers have employed utilization-management procedures, which limited patients' ability to gain access to Repatha. Execs said during Q3 earnings call that they're working with payers and providers to allow unlabeled patient access. Investors should look to see if collaborations with payers and providers are yielding significant Repatha growth.Alphabet Inc (GOOGL): The Cheapest $800 Stock I KnowThe drug, which currently competes withSanofiSA (ADR)(NYSE:SNY) andRegeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc's(NASDAQ:REGN) Praluent, had a 55% share of new-to-brand prescriptions (NBRx) in Q4, according to an Amgen presentation at this year's JPMorgan Healthcare Conference. Still, AMGN stock holders probably want to know just how much in sales that amounted to.But it has to be noted that an ongoing court case that Amgen filed against Sanofi and Regeneron onpatent infringementgrounds is tipping the scale in Rapatha's favor for now.Finally, investors should pay attention to see if low expenses is continuing and will continue at Amgen. Since the beginning of 2015, AMGN has reduced its total expenses by roughly 3.7% to 13.22%. Keeping expenses low will be critical to future profitability, especially in Trump's recent focus on drugmakers.Earnings apart, I believe the uncertainties surrounding the future make AMGN stock less attractive.As of this writing, Craig Adeyanju did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceApple Inc.

Hands down, Alphabet ranks No. 1, capturing 21 of 22.Innovation LeadersCuriously, all eight GSV-highlighted companies have dedicated efforts in the areas of artificial intelligence, big data and cloud services, making these three the Holy Grail of innovation.The first two come as no surprise, as data gathering and analysis are critical to predicting behavior, enabling companies to target consumers accordingly. Web services, which is now the fastest-growing segment for Amazon, is less obvious but nonetheless a clear indicator these innovators want to get bigger by serving as the backbone for other companies.10 Stocks to Buy That Already Make America GreatThis is key, and since Google already commands 49% of the global online advertising market according to Pivotal Research analyst Brian Wieser, I'll bet on GOOGL.MoonshotMuch of Google's innovative efforts happen at its off-site research center called Google X, aka the Moonshot Factory. It's run by a futurist named Astro Teller, and I highly recommend hisTED Talkexplaining how Google X approaches innovation:Identify a problem affecting millions of people.Find or propose a radical solution for solving that problem.Move full speed ahead if there's reason to believe technology for such a radical solution could actually be built.He says Google X people spend most of their time ""breaking things and trying to prove they're wrong"" but believes that's their secret … what makes Googlers different. By ""killing"" more projects than they approve, their success rate rises. Alphabet spent $13.8 billion last year on research and development - the second highest number of any company in the world behind Amazon, and second highest as a percentage of sales among the eight innovation leaders.R&D as % of RevenueAlphabet invests a staggering amount of money to fund R&D, both because it can and because it has to. With three times more online advertising than its next closest competitor, GOOGL is a cash cow.By the same token, it has significant overlap with all seven competitors in the most obvious categories - like robotics and AI- and each of these companies is hungry to dominate.There's no letting up in this crowd. Innovate or die.What's GOOGL Stock Worth?Ultimately, the question is value: What do we pay?I like to compare the growth we're getting (earnings) with the price we're paying (price-to-earnings, or P/E). This is called a price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG), and it's an intuitive way to compare apples to apples.Using 2017 consensus estimates tracked by Bloomberg, GOOGL stock is tucked right in the middle of the pack. Its PEG ratio is 1.08. PEGs below 1 are cheap, and PEGs approaching 2 are expensive.PEG ratios are revealing.First of all, no one should buyMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT). It's neither a growth stock nor a value play.Alibaba Group Holding Ltd(NYSE:BABA) is a tad expensive, but not excessively so, especially since many consider ittheChinese consumer trading vehicle.Amazon is attractive, so areApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) andFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB), both of which I have written up as longs and currently own.Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Has a New Hero: Services!Samsung(OTCMKTS:SSNLF), I admit is a mystery. It'ssocheap. I can only surmise its limited German and S. Korean listings deter U.S. investors, as does the $1,700 stock price. It needs to split at least 10-to-1.The TradeSell the GOOGL April $800 puts at $20 to initiate a long-biased position.If the stock pulls back and trades through the $800 strike price, I'm assigned shares and become a buyer. If Google continues making new highs, I pocket the premium. I am content either way. Google's chart indicates initial technical support around $780, and significant long-term support $700-$725.The reason I'm selling puts rather than buying the stock is because GOOGL stock has recently risen to a new all-time high. I know new highs tend to beget new highs (momentum traders buy strength), but I'm a value buyer at heart.Adam Johnson is Founder and Author ofBullseye Brief, an investment newsletter that presents thematic and actionable ideas.

You can see all of today's research reportshere >>>Buy ratedAlphabetshares have lagged the broader market as well as the Zacks Tech sector over the past year (the stock is up +6.1% over the last 12 months vs. the +16.6% gain for the S&P 500 index), with the company's weaker than expected Q4 earnings report only adding to its underperformance. A big reason for the underperformance is uncertainty about the earnings potential of its non-core ventures. These headwinds aside, the Zacks analyst points out the company's good execution to date, more or less maintaining its dominant share in a competitive, fast-growing search market. The company's focus on innovation, strategic acquisitions and Android OS should continue to generate strong cash flows. However, the promise of Google's non-search businesses continue getting pushed into future even as the company's spending keeps rising. (You canread the full research report on Alphabet here     >>)Chevronshares have gained +31% over the last one year, outperforming the Zacks Oil & Gas-International Integrated industry which has gained +23.2% over the same time period, as well as rival Exxon Mobil. Chevron exited 2016 on a mixed note, swinging to a Q4 profit from a year-ago loss even as earnings fell far below estimates. Rebounding oil and gas prices, together with lower operating expenses helped the company report a quarterly profit. However, Chevron's refining business saw its income plunge on weak margins and maintenance costs. Importantly, despite being free-cash-flow negative, the deficit has narrowed considerably and Chevron is hoping to be cash flow neutral this year. Anticipated production growth from its extensive footprint in the Permian Basin is another positive. (You canread the full research report on Chevron here   >>)Citigroupshares have modestly underperformed the Zacks Major Banks industry over the last one year, gaining +33.3% vs +38.3%. Citigroup's fourth-quarter earnings exceeded expectations. Recently, Citigroup inked two deals to exit servicing operations by the end of 2018, in a bid to increase focus on mortgage originations through U.S. retail footprint. The deals are expected to negatively impact first-quarter 2017 pre-tax results by about $400 million. Stringent regulatory landscape across the industry and its litigation burden are other concerns. However, the analyst likes the company's restructuring and streamlining efforts, strategic investments in core business and expense management, which should support profitability, going forward.

Analysts Forecast 11% Upside For GURU;2/1/2017;"Looking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe atETF Channel, we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the Guru Index ETF (Symbol: GURU), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $27.51 per unit.With GURU trading at a recent price near $24.88 per unit, that means that analysts see 10.58% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of GURU's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Darling Ingredients Inc (Symbol: DAR), Alphabet Inc (Symbol: GOOGL), and NIKE Inc (Symbol: NKE). Although DAR has traded at a recent price of $12.00/share, the average analyst target is 34.72% higher at $16.17/share. Similarly, GOOGL has 17.70% upside from the recent share price of $820.19 if the average analyst target price of $965.40/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting NKE to reach a target price of $59.70/share, which is 12.84% above the recent price of $52.90. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of DAR, GOOGL, and NKE:makeArticleAd();Combined, DAR, GOOGL, and NKE represent 5.87% of the Guru Index ETF.

Can Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Jump Over These Hurdles?;2/1/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAhead of earnings forFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB), which will come out at the end of trading on Wednesday, investors are certainly upbeat. And why not? FB stock has been a pretty good bet.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockBut could things be different this time around? Maybe the enthusiasm for Facebook stock is too carried away?Well, it is important to note that the valuation is still reasonable. The forward price-to-earnings ratio on FB stock is at about 25X. This compares to roughly 20X for bothAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) andMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT). And these companies are not growing at anywhere near the pace of Facebook.What's more, it seems like Facebook earnings should do fine in Q4. Revenues are expected to jump by 46% to $8.5 billion and adjusted EPS are forecasted to come to $1.31, up from 79 cents during the same period a year ago. Keep in mind that - for the past five quarters - the company has beat the Street on both the top and bottom lines.FB Stock Still Faces Several RisksBut the real potential issue for Facebook stock is any disappointing commentary on the future growth trends. Interestingly enough, on the Q3 earnings call, the company's CFO had this ominous thing tosay: ""We continue to expect that revenue growth rates will decline in Q4 as we lap a strong fourth quarter in 2015. We also continue to expect that our total payments and other fees revenue in Q4 will be lower than it was in the fourth quarter of last year.""10 Stocks to Buy That Already Make America GreatNo doubt, this should not be a surprise. As FB gets much larger, it will increasingly get more difficult to churn out strong revenue numbers. It's the curse of the so-called ""law of large numbers.""Let's face it, Facebook already has a massive user base. In the most recent quarter, the number of monthly active users hit 1.79 billion, up 16% on a year-over-year basis. There were also a stunning 1.2 billion daily users.But going forward, what will the sources of new users be? It's hard to tell. But initiatives from FB show concerns. After all, the company has been working hard to provide internet access to developing nations.And don't forget about China. According to a report from theWall Street Journal, it appears that Facebook has made little progress. Instead, rivals likeWeibo Corp(ADR)(NASDAQ:WB) andTencent(OTCMKTS:TCEHY) have been capitalizing on the opportunity.At the same time, other problems could affect FB stock. For example, during the last few months, there have been various embarrassing stories about how the company has inflated certain metrics. Might this cause some pushback from advertisers?The Snapchat IPO: The Next Facebook Inc (FB) ... Or Twitter Inc (TWTR)?Then there is the ""fake news"" controversy. Granted, the company has taken actions to improve the publishing of news, such as with a focus on credible sources. But this could result in lower clicks and views, which would slow down the revenue momentum for Facebook stock.Something else that could dampen some of the enthusiasm for FB stock: the upcoming Snapchat IPO, which should hit the markets within the next couple of months. Of course, there will be tremendous buzz and excitement. There will also be the inevitable comparisons to FB. In other words, investors may look at Snapchat as an alternative to Facebook stock when seeking the next growth play.Overall, Wednesday's earnings announcement will definitely be important. And if there are signs of deceleration on the top-line, FB stock could be vulnerable, especially since it has already pulled off a nice run for the year.Tom Taulli runs the InvestorPlace blogIPO Playbookand is a registered investment adviser representative (you canvisit his siteto learn more about his financial planning services).He is also the author of various books on investing like All About Commodities, All About Short Selling and High-Profit IPO Strategies.Follow him on Twitter at@ttaulli.

Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD): The Turnaround Is Legit!;1/31/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTurnarounds usually aren't neat, orderly affairs, butAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMD) just keeps building momentum as the semidconductor firm continues to remake itself. Fourth-quarter earnings out Tuesday evening launched AMD stock by another 5% in after-hours trading, continuing a roughly yearlong run that hasn't seen much in the way of pullbacks.makeArticleAd();Source:Matthew Rutledge via FlickrFor Q4, AMD posted an adjusted loss of 1 cent a share on revenues of $1.11 billion, which were up 15.4% year-over-year. While earnings were in line with Wall Street expectations, sales beat by about $40 million.Also driving AMD stock higher was upbeat earnings guidance for the current quarter. Advanced Micro Devices forecasts revenues to range from $955 million to $1.02 billion. Using the midpoint, AMD would be looking at an 18% increase to$989 million- well above analyst expectations for $964 million.The Top 10 Dow Dividend Stocks for FebruarySome additional highlights from AMD's fourth quarter:The Computing and Graphics unit saw its revenues jump by 28% to $600 million.The cash balance increased by $6 million, for a total of $1.26 billion.The company announced the brand of its new chips, called Ryzen.

For the most part, the technology looks like it has better performance and power usage compared toIntel Corporation's(NASDAQ:INTC) 8-core, 3.2GHz Core i7-6900K that came out in May - and it's cheaper.No surprise, then, that Alphabet has teamed up with AMD. But don't expect the large-cap tech partnerships to end there, and instead expect them to extend to the likes ofFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) andSalesforce.com, inc.(NYSE:CRM)? Headline-making deals like this could very well drive AMD stock in 2017.From CEO Lisa Su:""As we enter 2017, we are well  positioned and on-track to deliver our strongest set of high-performance computing and graphics products in more than a decade.""So, should bulls exercise any caution?Well, AMD stock has already staged an amazing rally, and yes, we probably won't see a repeat of 2016's triple-digit gains.After all, Advanced Micro Devices' market cap is now close to $10 billion.

The Lines Between Auto And Tech Are Getting Fuzzier;1/31/2017;"As we get closer and closer to a self-driving car future, the   lines between the auto industry and tech are getting blurry.In this clip fromIndustry Focus: Industrials, host Sean O'Reilly is joined by senior auto specialist John   Rosevear to talk about some of the most exciting tech news shared   byAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL)  andFord(NYSE: F)  at this year's North American International Auto   Show.A full transcript follows the video.makeArticleAd();10 stocks we like better than AlphabetWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even     better buys.Click hereto learn about these picks!*Stock Advisor returns as of January 4, 2017This podcast was recorded on Jan. 19, 2017.Sean O'Reilly:You mentioned how increasingly there's tech analysts there. It   might be just a happy coincidence that it was right after CES   [the Consumer Electronics Show]. Did it feel like a tech show   when you were there?John Rosevear:It has become really interesting. I didn't go to CES this year;   we had other folks from The Fool who were out there. But CES --   the Consumer Electronics Show, which is in Vegas -- is also held   usually the first week of January every year, has had more and   more of an automotive focus. Ford CEO Mark Fields was out there.MobileyeandDelphiwere demonstrating their new self-driving stuff out there.Fiat Chryslershowed off an electric concept minivan at CES. It's more and more   focused on autos, future-tech autos.Then the press days run up until Wednesday or Thursday of that   week, and then everything starts in Detroit the following Sunday.   It's just a couple days later; people fly straight in. This year,   it was very notable -- it was almost as if that conversation was   continuing on a separate track from the traditional show itself,   where they're unveiling the latest minivan and all that kind of   stuff.We had John Krafcik, who heads up Waymo. Waymo is the company   under the Alphabet umbrella formerly known as the Google   Self-Driving Car Project. John Krafcik was in Detroit; he gave a   presentation on Sunday afternoon talking about the state of   Waymo's technology and what they're doing to test it and so   forth. He was clearly there talking to the auto industry, talking   to the automakers.Waymo seems to be in ""let's make a deal"" mode right now. They   showed off the test car they created with Fiat Chrysler, a   Waymo-ized version of the Chrysler Pacifica minivan, which is   already kind of futuristic and sexy-looking. It's kind of   cool-looking; their self-driving sensors and stuff are much more   smoothly integrated. You can still tell it's a test car, it still   has this big thing on the roof. But it looks more like something   you might see produced in the near future. They were running   around withToyotaand Lexus and Audi test vehicles with stuff tacked on for   years.But anyway, to get back to the point, there was a steady   discussion. Ford had a whole separate thing going on adjacent to   the show where they had speakers on future mobility. Ford is   trying to get into the business of helping cities come up with   mobility plans as electric cars, self-driving, ride-sharing, and   so forth become more prevalent and more affordable as technology   advances. And this is a whole separate discussion that's going on   throughout the show, aside from the traditional show itself,   where automakers are showing off their new vehicles to the global   media. It was really interesting, the way this is going. And   there were several points in the show where I wished there had   been two of me, because there were two things going on at the   same time that I really wanted to attend.Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The     Motley Fool's board of directors.John Rosevearowns shares of Ford.Sean O'Reillyhas no position in any stocks mentioned.

Is Voice Search an Opportunity or a Threat to Google?;1/31/2017;"Image source: Google.Consumers are doing more and more web searches just by   talking. And they're not just asking the digital assistants on   their smartphones; they're also buying all-new devices, such as   theAmazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) Echo and Google Home, to answer random   queries.makeArticleAd();For Google, the subsidiary ofAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) , the new trend in search is a   double-edged sword. On one hand, it provides another point for   users to interact with its product. On the other, Google doesn't   have a stranglehold on the device market, and it isn't clear how   companies can monetize voice search with ads.Even as Google navigated the shift to mobile, it still   fundamentally followed the same business model -- display ads   within search results. That's not possible with voice   searches.But Google CEO Sundar Pichai isn't concerned. ""I see more   opportunity than challenge, when I think about voice search,"" he   told analysts on the company's fourth-quarter earnings call. I   wouldn't be so sure he doesn't have that backward.Losing the hardware battleGoogle didn't provide any exact figures on the sales of its   new Google Home device. Pichai did say that ""Google Home was a   very popular present that many people opened on Christmas   morning,"" but that was as detailed as he got.RBC analyst Mark Mahaney suggests that Google is getting   outsold 10-to-1 by competitors such as Amazon Echo. That presents   a real challenge for Google, because without control over the   hardware, it has no control over the user interface. That means   all those potential voice searches will go to someone else.Pichai points out that it's the very early days for devices   such as Google Home. And Google does have one big advantage over   Amazon and other competitors -- it's much better at search. ""When   I look at what it would take to voice search well, our years of   progress we have done in areas like natural language processing   comes into play,"" Pichai said on the call. To his credit,   Google Home has outperformed Alexain manyhead-to-head searchreviews.But smart-speaker hardware is about more than search, and   Amazon's Echo is capable of integrating with more devices and   services than Google Home is. Google is certainly capable of   overcoming that through more strategic partnerships, though. It   just released a development kit for businesses to integrate with   Google Home last month.One area that will be harder to overcome is how well Amazon   Echo works for Amazon Prime members. With tens of millions of   Prime members around the world, it creates a pretty big moat for   Google Home to cross.But wait -- it gets tougherEven if Google closes the gap in hardware sales, it still has   to find a way to turn voice search into a business. Hardware   sales won't move the needle for Alphabet, which generated over   $90 billion in revenue last year.What's more, Google has to sell the hardware near cost because   its biggest competitor, Amazon, does the same. The margins on a   Google Home device don't even come close to Google's 31%   operating margin in the fourth quarter.If Google is going to make some real money off of voice   search, it needs to go beyond just getting its devices into   people's homes. Google's best idea so far is tofacilitate commerce through voice search. But if there's one company that has Google's number in   e-commerce search, it's Amazon. Google will not win a battle   against Amazon in developing a personal shopping assistant, no   matter how good its search capabilities are.Not just a challenge -- a threatThe growth of voice isn't just a challenge for Google. The   shift to voice represents a threat, as it could result in a   decline in the amount consumers use Google search, the company's   cash cow.Google is working to overcome the head start Amazon got in   smart speakers, which accelerated the voice search trend. It   plans to expand its hardware lineup and invest more in 2017. But   as voice search continues growing and starts taking searches away   from mobile and desktop, it will put pressure on Google to   continue developing new higher-value display and search ads for   its main desktop and mobile products.10 stocks we like better than Alphabet (A   shares)When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Top Analyst Reports for Alphabet, Citigroup, Chevron & Others;1/31/2017;"makeZacksArticleAd();Tuesday, January 31 2017Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Alphabet (GOOGL), Chevron (CVX) and Citigroup (C). You can see all of today's research reportshere >>>Buy ratedAlphabetshares have lagged the broader market as well as the Zacks Tech sector over the past year (the stock is up +6.1% over the last 12 months vs. the +16.6% gain for the S&P 500 index), with the company's weaker than expected Q4 earnings report only adding to its underperformance. A big reason for the underperformance is uncertainty about the earnings potential of its non-core ventures. These headwinds aside, the Zacks analyst points out the company's good execution to date, more or less maintaining its dominant share in a competitive, fast-growing search market. The company's focus on innovation, strategic acquisitions and Android OS should continue to generate strong cash flows. However, the promise of Google's non-search businesses continue getting pushed into future even as the company's spending keeps rising. (You canread the full research report on Alphabet here >>)Chevronshares have gained +31% over the last one year, outperforming the Zacks Oil & Gas-International Integrated industry which has gained +23.2% over the same time period, as well as rival Exxon Mobil. Chevron exited 2016 on a mixed note, swinging to a Q4 profit from a year-ago loss even as earnings fell far below estimates. Rebounding oil and gas prices, together with lower operating expenses helped the company report a quarterly profit. However, Chevron's refining business saw its income plunge on weak margins and maintenance costs. Importantly, despite being free-cash-flow negative, the deficit has narrowed considerably and Chevron is hoping to be cash flow neutral this year. Anticipated production growth from its extensive footprint in the Permian Basin is another positive. (You canread the full research report on Chevron here >>)Citigroupshares have modestly underperformed the Zacks Major Banks industry over the last one year, gaining +33.3% vs +38.3%. Citigroup's fourth-quarter earnings exceeded expectations. Recently, Citigroup inked two deals to exit servicing operations by the end of 2018, in a bid to increase focus on mortgage originations through U.S. retail footprint. The deals are expected to negatively impact first-quarter 2017 pre-tax results by about $400 million. Stringent regulatory landscape across the industry and its litigation burden are other concerns. However, the analyst likes the company's restructuring and streamlining efforts, strategic investments in core business and expense management, which should support profitability, going forward.

Is Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Resurrecting the Cursed Windows RT?;1/31/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsDon't look now, butMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) looks to be taking another run atAlphabet Inc's(NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) Chrome operating system. References have begun popping up in builds of the Windows 10 Creators Update (which is due to arrive in April) to Windows 10 Cloud.makeArticleAd();Source: MicrosoftSpeculation is growing that Windows 10 Cloud is in fact a new simplified version of Microsoft's operating system, designed to run on devices powered by inexpensive ARM chips fromARM Holdings plc (ADR)(NASDAQ:ARMH).In other words, it appears that Microsoft is preparing to take on the threat of Chromebooks - the cheap, popular laptops running Google's Chrome OS. And it seems to be doing so by resurrecting the idea of Windows RT.Windows 10 CloudWindows 10 Creators Build is the next major revision of the Microsoft Windows PC operating system. It's due to begin rolling out to users around April 17.The 5 Best Stocks to Buy for Big Emerging Markets ProfitsBut developers have been testing pre-release builds of Microsoft's software and recently some of them began to notice something strange: The code references different variations of the operating system. For example, Windows 10 Pro for Workstation and Windows 10 for Enterprise are spiked out. Nothing unusual there. But then, references to Windows 10 Cloud began to appear. And that started raising eyebrows - what is Windows 10 Cloud?ZDNet'sMary Jo Foley put the pieces together yesterday. Quoting unnamed sources, she says that the mysterious Windows 10 Cloud is a new, simplified version of Microsoft Windows that will run only Unified Windows Platform (UWP) apps. In other words, it's a""simpler, safer, cheaper"" version of Windows 10.You might also think of it as another crack at Windows RT …Windows RT? But Why?Everyone remembers the mess that wasWindows RT. The attempt to shoehorn a version of Windows onto a consumer tablet running ARM chips -the ill-fated Surface RT - very nearly dealt MSFT's tablet aspirations a fatal blow.However, despite the failure of Windows RT, Microsoft has never given up on the idea of Windows on ARM chips. By doing so, it can get Windows onto mobile devices that can't use the more powerful and expensive chips fromIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC). The company has already been showing offWindows 10 running in emulation on high-end ARM chips. As part of that effort, it could also be working on a ""lite"" version that can deliver much of the Windows 10 experience on less expensive, lower powered ARM hardware.So why, why,whywould Microsoft risk falling flat on its face again with what essentially amounts to another crack at Windows RT? There are two reasons.The first is that dream of ""Windows everywhere."" Having the full Windows 10 experience on high-powered ARM chips is great, but only flagship smartphones and tablets can afford to use those chips. Windows 10 Cloud would get Microsoft Windows (and Bing) onto a whole lot more mobile hardware.The second is Google's Chrome OS and Chromebooks. These cheap laptops have been under Microsoft's skin for years. They've become extremely popular in the education sector thanks to low cost, ease of use and built-in security. And Chromebooks have just kept selling, to the point where last year they passed evenApple Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AAPL)MacBooks in sales.Microsoft has tried fighting back by helping manufacturers put out cheap Windows 10 laptops, but that hasn't stemmed the Chromebook flood. Windows 10 makes for a sluggish experience on inexpensive Intel hardware, it's far more complex than Chrome OS to use and lacks the drop-dead easy security of Chromebooks.Cash Out of Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Before EarningsWindows 10 Cloud running on laptops with ARM processors would compete head-to-head with Chromebooks running Chrome OS: simpler, safer and cheaper than Windows 10.Microsoft refused to comment on theZDNetpost, but the pieces pointing to Windows 10 as a Chrome OS-fighting, second crack at Windows RT make sense. Naturally, MSFT is going to avoid all references to Windows RT - that's poison - and the Windows 10 Cloud name could end up being a code name.It could also be an attempt to steal some of the Chrome OS ""cloud"" thunder. Expect to get the final answer on Windows 10 Cloud from Microsoft prior to that April 17 Windows 10 Creators Build release.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace3 ""Golden"" Ammo Stocks to Buy for Big 2017 Returns3 Stocks to Buy for Better Deals Than the Great RecessionThe postIs Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Resurrecting the Cursed Windows RT?appeared first onInvestorPlace."

Buy the Dip in Alphabet Inc (GOOGL, GOOG) Stock;1/31/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) took its turn in the earnings limelight last week, and investors were not happy with the results.Offering up a rare miss, Alphabet said it earned $9.36 per share versus expectations of $9.63 per share, while revenue arrived at $26.06 billion compared to predictions for $25.22 billion.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockGOOGL stock has since fallen more than 5%, and its edging lower once again today.But the shares were due for a bit of a selloff, as GOOGL stock was overbought heading into earnings amid an overly enthusiastic sentiment backdrop. Contrarian investors know that this is a recipe for short-term disaster on even the slightest hiccup.Click to EnlargeNow that the knee-jerk selling has about run its course, it's time to get back to being realistic on GOOGL stock's prospects. Technically, Alphabet shares remain in a long-term uptrend, supported by its 10-week and 20-week moving averages.Furthermore, these trendlines completed a bullish cross earlier this month, which could bring bargain hunters to the table once the post-earnings gyrations have subsided.The 5 Best Stocks to Buy for Big Emerging Markets ProfitsAs for sentiment, the fourth-quarter earnings blip for GOOGL stock hasn't shaken the brokerage community one bit. And it shouldn't. According to Thomson/First Call, all but two of the 48 analysts following Alphabet Inc rate the shares a ""buy"" or better. Additionally, the 12-month price target of $988.47 represents a modest premium of only about 19% to GOOGL's Monday close.With search ad revenue holding strong and Alphabet expanding its hardware program, we may even see a few upward revisions in the next month or so.On the options front, GOOGL Feb./March put/call open interest ratio has risen slightly in the past week to rest at 0.72, with puts gaining a bit of traction in the wake of last week's quarterly report. For the March series, traders are still eyeing the $860 and $900 strikes, while put traders are focused on $800 and $750.Overall, March implieds are pricing in a potential move of about 5% in the next two months. Currently, this places the upper bound at $865.02, while the lower bound lies at $782.64 from Monday's close. I would be surprised to see GOOGL stock trade south of $800, as it would take some unexpectedly poor news from Alphabet or a significant turn in the overall market. A rally to $860 seems more likely, though resistance at $850 could be a stumbling block.2 Trades for GOOGL StockPut Sell:The safest route to profit on GOOGL stock right now would be to bank on technical support and sell option premium. Right now, the March $800 put looks like a solid bet for such a play. At last check, this put was bid at $12, or $1,200 per contract.As usual, you keep the premium as long as GOOGL stock closes above $800 when these options expire. The downside is that should Alphabet trade below $800 ahead of March expiration, you could be assigned 100 shares for each sold put at a cost of $800 per share.Sprint Corp (S) Q3 Earnings Give Bulls the Green Light: Keep Buying!Call Spread:If you are more bullish on GOOGL stock's prospects, then a March $830/$850 bull call spread has potential At last check, this spread was offered at $8, or $800 per pair of contracts.Breakeven lies at $838.00, while a maximum profit of $12, or $1,200 per pair of contracts, is possible if Alphabet closes at or above $850 when March options expire.As of this writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 Stocks to Buy That Already Make America Great7 Stocks to Buy That Could Double by 2018The postBuy the Dip in Alphabet Inc (GOOGL, GOOG) Stockappeared first onInvestorPlace."

5 Reasons I Don't Buy MeetMe's Growth Story;1/31/2017;"Last December, I highlightedMeetMe(NASDAQ: MEET) as apotentially undervaluedgrowth play in a frothy market. The social networking app maker   posted eye-popping numbers last quarter -- 32% annual growth in   monthly active users (MAUs), 20% growth in total revenues, and   30% non-GAAP earnings growth.Analysts expect MeetMe's revenue and non-GAAP earnings to   respectively rise 38% and 16% next year. Yet the stock trades at   just 7 times trailing earnings and 10 times forward earnings.   Let's take a look at the five key reasons investors aren't buying   MeetMe's growth story, despite its high growth figures and low   valuations.MeetMe's mobile app. Image source: Google Play.makeArticleAd();1. A troubling history with sexual predatorsMeetMe lets users find new people in their area to chat with,   similar toMatch's(NASDAQ: MTCH) Tinder. While there's nothing inherently   sinister about the app, there have been multiple reports of   MeetMe being used by sexual predators.In 2014, the City of San Francisco sued MeetMe for the   unlawful publication of minors' profiles, photos, and geolocation   data, and claimed that  the app ""enabled"" sexual predators   to find their victims. The city cited several cases involving   adult men and minors in which MeetMe was used. MeetMe settled the   case for $200,000 the  following year, agreeing to clarify   and simplify its user agreements and settings, and reducing the   amount of data displayed on minors to their city and state.But the cases involving MeetMe didn't cease -- last February,   a Buffalo man was  charged with multiple counts of child   pornography after using MeetMe to find minors. MeetMe's troubles   raised red flags at Tinder, which hiked its age limit from 13 to   18 last June. Yet MeetMe still hasn't followed suit, presumably   because it would lose a large portion of its users.2. The potential loss of ad revenuesYou'd think that big companies would be reluctant to advertise   on MeetMe, but plenty of big brands still advertise on the app.   That's because MeetMe generates most of its ad revenues from   programmatic ads delivered byTwitter's(NYSE:TWTR) MoPub.This means that MoPub's customers simply pick a demographic --   in MeetMe's case, younger users and Millennials -- and the   platform feeds the ads to various apps. This means that many   companies probably don't realize that their ads are appearing on   MeetMe.Therefore, a common bear thesis is that MoPub could decide to   drop MeetMe due to violations of its terms of service, or   advertisers could ask MoPub to pull their ads from the   controversial app. There's no evidence either of these scenarios   will occur, but it raises a troubling question -- if MeetMe's   reputation worsens, can it still keep growing its ad   revenues?3. Being booted from the app storesIn its 10-K filing for fiscal 2015, MeetMe admits  that   its business will suffer if it is ""unable to maintain a good   relationship"" withAppleandAlphabet's Google. It notes that its app could be pulled from their app   stores ""if we violate"" or the companies believe ""that we have   violated"" their terms and conditions.The bulls might believe that's just a typical ""risk factor""   warning, but MeetMe admits in the same filing that ""on more than   one occasion,"" Apple rejected its app ""because of user generated   content and other concerns."" This indicates that another   high-profile lawsuit could knock MeetMe out of the app stores and   kill its business.4. Tinder is crushing MeetMeMeetMe arrived before Tinder, which was initially launched in   2012. But over the past five years, mainstream interest in MeetMe   waned in correlation with Tinder's growth, as seen in this chart   from Google Trends:Image source: Google.That decline also explains why MeetMe acquired its competitor   Skout last  October. That move boosted the company's MAU   count from about 5 million to  8.5 million, and greatly   inflated MeetMe's top and bottom line growth for fiscal 2016.5. The lack of insider confidenceIf MeetMe is as undervalued as the fundamentals suggest, you'd   expect insiders to be loading up on shares. However, MeetMe CEO   Geoffrey Cook just  sold 250,000 shares (16% of his entire   position) at an average price of $5.02.Including Cook's sales, insiders sold  1.96 million   shares over the past 12 months, but only bought 334,000 shares.   It's understandable that MeetMe's insiders would sell after the   stock's 50% rally over the past 12 months, but it also indicates   that its upside potential could be limited.The key takeawayThe main lesson here is to always look beyond the valuations   and growth forecasts. On the surface, MeetMe looks like a rapidly   growing social app maker trading at a discount to its peers. But   dig deeper, and you'll see an app that's struggling to prove that   it's not a tool for criminals while remaining relevant against   Tinder, which dominates the space with  over 50 million   active users.10 stocks we like better than MeetMeWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

4 Reasons I'm Buying Baidu Inc. (ADR) Stock;1/31/2017;"Chinese search giantBaidu(NASDAQ: BIDU) is often dismissed as a slow-growth tech stock   that has run out of room to grow. Its heavy investments in   expanding its ecosystem into adjacent markets have weighed down   its bottom line growth, making the stock seem like dead money.   Despite those challenges, however, I recently started a new   position in Baidu for four main reasons.Baidu Image Search. Image source: Author's screenshot.makeArticleAd();1. It's still the 800-pound gorillaBaidu controls roughly 80% of the internet search market in   China. That dominant position enables it to expand its ecosystem   in the same way asAlphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google. Its sprawling ecosystem   now includes Baidu Maps, video streaming site iQiyi, its Duer   voice assistant, the Baidu Wallet payment platform, numerous   portal sites, and various O2O (online-to-offline) services in its   ""monolithic"" mobile app.While the profitability of these services varies greatly, they   all help Baidu gather data from its users for targeted ads. Last   quarter, Baidu's revenue per online marketing customer rose 10.6%   annually. This indicates that Baidu still remains a top   advertising pick in China, even as other popular apps -- likeTencent's WeChat -- tether more users to their ecosystems. Moreover,   China still has an internet penetration rate of just 52%, which   means that there may be plenty of room for all these companies to   expand without stepping on each other's toes.2. Its slowdown is temporaryBaidu fell out of favor with growth investors as its top and   bottom line growth seemingly dried up. Last quarter, its revenue   fell  0.7% annually, its core online marketing revenue slid   6.7%, and its non-GAAP net income rose just 6.3%. Analysts expect   its  revenue to rise 6% this year, but for its earnings to   decline 9%.However, that slowdown was mainly caused by three temporary   headwinds. First, Chinese regulators forced Baidu to remove   misleading pharmaceutical ads following the death of a student   who bought unapproved cancer drugs advertised on the site.   Second, Baidu sold its stake in online travel agencyQunarto its rivalCtrip(NASDAQ: CTRP) , essentially swapping its stake in Qunar for one   in Ctrip but temporarily throttling revenue growth.Lastly, Baidu's heavy investments in R&D are squeezing its   margins, but launching new services could boost its long-term   growth and widen its moat against rivals like Tencent. That's why   analysts believe that Baidu's revenue and earnings will   respectively rebound 21% and 33% in fiscal 2017.3. Growth potential in next-gen marketsLike Google, Baidu is investing heavily in artificial   intelligence, driverless cars, and other ""next-gen"" technologies.   Machine learning and AI have become increasingly important to   search and advertising companies, since they help gather more   data from users to create targeted ads that users are more likely   to click on. Baidu has been hiring a lot of top talent in that   field -- its chief scientist, Andrew Ng, previously led the   Google Brain AI project, and its  new augmented reality   chief Qi Lu was aMicrosoftexec specializing in AI.To showcase its AI efforts, Baidu pitted its AI robot against   Google's AlphaGo AI in a battle of facial and voice recognition   in early January. It partnered withNVIDIAand HERE Maps to develop mapping systems for autonomous vehicles,   and plans to launch a driverless shuttle bus in China in 2018. It   also partnered with  smart remote maker Peel to establish a   foothold in the growing smart home market. These projects   won't generate meaningful revenue for years, but they could   greatly expand Baidu's O2O ecosystem over the long term.4. The stock is still cheapBaidu currently trades at just 13 times earnings, which is   much lower than Google's P/E of 31 and the industry average of 50   for internet information providers. But due to its projected   decline in earnings this year, the stock has a forward P/E of 30.   While that forward multiple doesn't seem cheap, we should   remember that Baidu's earnings are expected to rebound in   2017.The key takeawayBaidu will likely remain weighed down by near-term challenges   over the next few quarters, but it's still well-positioned to   profit from the long-term growth of the Chinese internet market.   Baidu may struggle to pull social users away from Tencent and   shoppers away fromAlibaba, but its dominance of the search-based ad market won't end   anytime soon.10 stocks we like better than Alphabet (A     shares)When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Alphabet Employees Protest Against Trump's Immigration Ban;1/31/2017;"Protests against Donald Trump's anti-immigration policy are gaining steam and the technology sector appears to be leading the way.  More than 2000Alphabet Inc.'sGOOGLGoogle employees staged protests against Trump's immigration ban by walking out of eight offices worldwide including the company's headquarters in Mountain View on Monday. Photos and videos of the walkouts have been tweeted using hashtag #GooglersUnite.Google co-founder Sergey Brin and CEO Sundar Pichai have extended their full support to the opposition.Concurrent with the protest, Google created a $4 million fund to support immigrant rights groups like the Immigrant Legal Resource Center, the American Civil Liberties Union, the U.N. Refugee Agency and the International Rescue Committee.The protest was particularly against Trump's executive order to ban nationals of seven Muslim majority countries - Iraq, Iran, Somalia, Libya, Syria, Sudan and Yemen - from coming to the U.S. Pichai denounced the order and stated that the ban affects about 187 Google employees.We note that not quite long ago, Trump had called up technology leaders and urged them to create and retain jobs within the U.S. to which most of them had given their nods. However as the immigration ban order rolled out, the sector is sending clear indications that it will not create jobs at the cost of preventing entry to external talent.Alphabet Inc.

QuoteProtests Across the Technology IndustryTrump's immigration restrictions have faced the flak of tech leaders in the form of tweets, memos and statements. Chief executive officers of MicrosoftMSFT, AppleAAPL, NetflixNFLX, Uber, Airbnb and Tesla Motors have all indicated that they are against the decision.The technology sector recruits a big chunk outside talent and the survival of the sector could be at stake if immigration reduces or stops completely.The sector fears that Trump may overhaul the H1-B program that allows Silicon Valley to bring foreign engineers and technical experts to the U.S. for three to six years.Zacks Rank and Stock Price MovementAt present, Alphabet is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company.

Ed Ho, the vice president of engineering, in a series of tweets, said that in the coming days, Twitter will start ""rolling out a number of product changes"" and ""tackle long overdue fixes to mute/block and stopping repeat offenders from creating new accounts."" He also added that management is working on making Twitter a ""safer platform"" with utmost ""urgency."" He refrained from giving a detailed explanation on the type of ""product changes"" that the company is mulling on.Twitter, Inc. Price and ConsensusTwitter, Inc. Price and Consensus|Twitter, Inc. QuoteTwitter has been trying to contain the trolling menace that has plagued its platform for long now and has possibly kept potential users as well as buyers at bay. Women, minorities as well the LGBT community often have been the target of ridicule on the platform.Reportedly, in January this year, a number of LGBT groups launched a campaign to urge Twitter to deal with the ""homophobic"" abuses posted on the social media site. Last year, Twitter found itself in trouble after African American actress, Leslie Jones was brutally trolled on the platform, prompting her to quit for some time. However, Twitter took swift action after Jones' complaint and banned several users for lifetime including Breitbart technology editor Milo Yiannopoulos. Also, Twitter took down accounts of several so called ""alt-right"" to curb hateful conduct on its platform.Apart from taking down accounts of offenders, Twitter also announced several measures to combat trolling. Twitter improvised the ""mute"" button, which will enable users to block tweets that contain objectionable words, phrases and conversations from their notification tabs. Plus, the company empowered users by giving them a ""more direct way of reporting"" hateful conduct. Any Twitter user can now report any hateful conduct that they come across on the platform. Per Twitter, this ""helps reduce the burden on the person experiencing the abuse, and helps to strengthen a culture of collective support on Twitter."" The company said that it is also ""retraining"" its staff to better tackle abusive behavior on the platform.Twitter is going through one of the toughest phases in its corporate history. User growth is sluggish and advertising revenues are decelerating. Amid this entire fracas, the exodus of high profile executives continues. In the past one year, shares of Twitter declined 5.70% as against 9.91% rise in the ZacksInternet Softwareindustry.
