Which Is More Important, Technical Or Fundamental Analysis?;4/5/2017;"Despite many thousands of books written on the subject of market analysis and countless theories that attempt to explain the movement of stocks, bonds, commodities and currencies, there are, at heart, only two types of analysis: fundamental and technical.Fundamental analysis involves assessing the economic conditions that influence price, such as supply, demand, and the overall state of the domestic, and global economy. In the case of the stock and bond markets, it also involves looking at the balance sheet and financial health of a corporation, or maybe at the prospects for a specific industry.Technical analysis, on the other hand, is about analyzing past price action and from that deriving a predictive model for the future.makeArticleAd();The question I am most frequently asked by those new to trading is “Which is more important, technical or fundamental analysis?”When that question arises one of the hardest things for me is to avoid answering with a cliché, as there are really only two honest answers: ”Both” or “It depends.”As is so often the case, what is presented as a binary choice in that question is anything but that. There is no reason that traders or investors need to choose between fundamental and technical analysis. In an ideal world each trade would come about from a combination of the two, with technical analysis supporting the fundamental, or vice versa.That makes “both” a valid answer to the question, but “it depends” can be just as accurate. In general, fundamental analysis is more useful for long term trades and investments, whereas technical analysis is more useful from a short term perspective. Over a period of a few minutes to a day or two technical levels of support and resistance can influence the direction of a price massively. Take a look at the chart below for Microsoft (MSFT) as an example.Following the earnings release in October the stock jumped to a high of 61.40 before retracing. When that level was tested again at the end of November it proved to be a significant point of resistance, and after several tries to break through, MSFT dropped back around 4.5% in just a couple of days. Clearly previous price action matters, but then look at what happened after that.Microsoft at that time was growing its enterprise business significantly, and stocks in general were in the midst of what has become known as the “Trump Bump”. Fundamental conditions, both micro (pertaining to Microsoft) and macro (pertaining to the broader economy), made MSFT an attractive stock, and as a result it smashed through that level a few days later and carried on higher. This ably demonstrates that while technical factors can have a huge short term influence, fundamentals win in the end.If forced to choose between the two I would pick fundamental analysis as the more influential. There is no real reason for what happened in the past should influence the future. It does so only because we, as human beings, seek to impose order on things. We look for reasons to do things, and past price history can provide us with them. Understanding that also leads to the conclusion that the best technical analysis is the most simple.The significance of a particular price level is a function of how many people identify it and act accordingly. In the MSFT example above, the previous high attracted enough sellers to push the price down, but it was an obvious level. The more obscure analyses that demand advanced math skills or calculations may appeal to our vanity, but if nobody else recognizes the levels that they suggest they are essentially worthless. When it comes to technical analysis the old KISS adage (Keep It Simple, Stupid) definitely applies.It should be clear that both technical and fundamental analysis have a place in devising a trade. Ideally, fundamental analysis is used to determine direction, while technical analysis suggests timing and specific entry and exit points. Of course nothing can guarantee that every trade is successful, but if you use that formula you give yourself a better chance of success than relying on one or the other."

Adobe Is Going All In on AI;4/5/2017;"Adobe Systems Inc.(NASDAQ: ADBE) may be best known for its ubiquitous Portable   Document Format (PDF), which is used in the creation and exchange   of documents. The company is also well-known for its suite of   creative products like photo editing software Photoshop,   Illustrator software for creating scalable graphics and artwork,   and desktop publishing software InDesign.Over the last several years, Adobe embarked on a mission to   migrate its business, and has gradually evolved from a company   producing and selling creative programs to a   software-as-a-service (SaaS) company that provides subscriptions   to a suite of products hosted on the web. During its transition,   the company has also become a force in the area of web analytics.   Adobe is currently working to integrate artificial intelligence   (AI) into its products, via a system it dubbed Sensei, for use by   cloud customers.Senseiis a Japanese word which means an honored teacher or mentor.Adobe wants to train every technical employee in AI     fundamentals. Image source: Adobe Systems.makeArticleAd();Excitement about developments in AIMachine learning, a subdiscipline of AI, endows computers with   the ability to learn, combining software models and complex   algorithms that can search through massive amounts of data for   hidden patterns and insights. These programs can apply what they   have learned while adapting to new information.During its most recent earnings conference call, Adobe stated   (emphasis mine):Last month we held our internal Tech Summit where we     announced our commitmentto train every one of our technical employees in     artificial intelligence fundamentals. We also demonstrated the incredible work happening across the     company.Partnering for the AI revolutionThe company has revealed several recent collaborations in   pursuit of its AI agenda. Last week, it announced a partnership   withMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) that would integrate customer relationship   management (CRM) data from Microsoft's Azure cloud and the Adobe   Cloud. Applying machine-learning techniques across the data will   provide advertisers with additional insights, help manage   advertising across a variety of platforms, and allow for more   targeted and personalized messages. The companies are also   sharing data models and core libraries between Sensei andMicrosoft's AI assistant Cortana, and will collaborate on ways to leverage Microsoft's   virtual-reality HoloLens headset for advertising.Adobe and Microsoft are partnering across platforms. Image     source: Adobe Systems.Sensei will be powered by graphics processing units (GPUs)   from industry leaderNVIDIA(NASDAQ: NVDA) , which Adobe already uses in many of its creative   products. The companies have an ongoing collaboration to develop   and optimize these graphics chips for new applications.NVIDIA GPUs have been widely usedto accelerate the training of AI systems due to their massive   parallel-processing capabilities, and arealready employed by Microsoft's Azure Cloud, where Sensei is being hosted.Adobe is partnering withAmazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) and itsvirtual assistant Alexato develop skills that will integrate with its Experience Cloud   and provide customers the status of their rewards miles from   hotels and airlines. Alexa will also recommend activities or   promotions based on customer profiles, and Adobe says it will do   so while still protecting user privacy. Alexa and itsEcho smart-home speakerpossess over 10,000 skills and were the hit of the holiday season   for Amazon. With a user base estimated to be nearing10% of U.S. households, this could provide a rich source of additional data for   Adobe.Joining an emerging trendAdobe has produced impressive gains during its transition. In   its most recent quarter, the company reported record results in a   variety of metrics including revenue, earnings, and cash flow.   Its revenue increased 22% over the prior-year quarter, while net   income grew an impressive 42% year over year. The company   finished 2016 with a record $5.85 billion in annual revenue,   $4.01 billion of which was recurring, and $2.01 billion in   deferred revenue.Adobe joins a growing trend of companies jumping on the AI   bandwagon to improve their businesses and gain competitive   advantages. Adobe says that it has been using similar technology   for some time and that this is just the next logical step.   There's no way to quantify how the company will benefit   financially from its venture into AI, but it provides intriguing   opportunities, and companies that don't make use of the latest   technology risk being left behind.10 stocks we like better than Adobe SystemsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Amazon & Microsoft: Are These Cloud Computing Leaders in a Growth Slowdown?;4/4/2017;"""The cloud"" and ""cloud computing"" have become incredible buzzwords. It seems most people are floating around the idea, as the term ambiguously suggests, but don't seem to have a grasp on how the cloud functions.Believed to be invented by American psychologist and computer scientist J.C.R. Licklider in the 1960's, cloud computing was created to connect data for people between locations and times. Now, this technology has vastly grown and made publicly available by industry leaders AmazonAMZNand MicrosoftMSFT.What is the Cloud?In basic terms, cloud computing is accessing and storing data over the Internet. To the end user, benefits of the cloud include: the ability to deliver and manage their own computer resources, scale up or scale down computing levels as needed, and only pay for the amount of computing power they use.Synergy Research Groupshowscloud vendor revenues reached $148 billion in 2016, which accounts for 25% annualized growth. Clearly, this is a vast and fast growing space. Leaders in the movement are changing the traditional notion of accessing data through hardware by introducing the idea of retrieving data through space, or the cloud.At the end of the day, this data needs to be stored somewhere. Companies which offer cloud computing services allocate massive and secure servers to store the data being held in the cloud. Even though cloud data is not being stored in users' personal hard drives, is it held somewhere and may be vulnerable to failures.With the rate of growth this technology is flying at, it seems cloud computing will soon take over the necessities of personal hard drive space. The two popularly known leaders of the cloud computing business are known to be: Amazon with AWS (Amazon Web Service, Inc) and Microsoft with Azure.How Fast are the Amazon and Microsoft Growing?Amazon's cloud computing service, AWS, launched in 2006. They advertise themselves to deliver large computing capabilities and capacities which cost less and take less time than a company building physical servers. As of 2016, AWS offers more than 70 services.Year over Year (Y/Y) growth of AWS sales for Amazon were increasing until, and as of now peaked on, Q2 of 2015 at 81%. Since, AWS revenues have been seeing high growth, but not to the level it once did. In Q4 of 2016, Y/Y net sales growth for AWS was 47%.A similar story is shown with Microsoft's Azure. Y/Y revenue growth (GAAP) of their Azure business capped, to date, in Q2 of 2016 at 127% growth. Just like AWS, the later quarters show sales growth at a decreasing rate with Q4 2016 Y/Y revenue growth (GAAP) at 93%.So… Who Cares?Two of the leaders in cloud computing platforms have not been able to increase their sales growth of their respective cloud businesses. In an industry which is infamous for how fast it is expanding into the hands of businesses and individuals, these numbers are concerning.It looks like the maximum potential for Amazon's and Microsoft's sales growth for their cloud computing businesses have capped. Unless either company releases break through cloud computing technology or breaking price points, their sales growth rates look to continually decrease considering current levels.Which Stocks are Zacks Experts Talking About?makeArticleAd();Stocks in today's headlines may be tempting buys, but how would you like to peek behind the curtain to see all the best stocks Zacks' team of experts are recommending?

Apple Inc. (AAPL) Promises New Mac Pro in 2018, New Pro iMac in 2017;4/4/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) has been taking heat from customers for ignoring its core, professional Mac users. The Mac Pro was last updated in 2013, and even then, its design alienated some. Apple held a rare turntable event with tech journalists to talk about the Mac. The company promises it has heard the complaints and it's pledging an all new Mac Pro in 2018.makeArticleAd();Source: AppleTo tide those power users over in the meantime, the company has goosed the specs of the existing model, is cutting some prices and it will introduce a new iMac aimed at pro users later this year.Senior Apple Execs Talk Mac PlansApple brought a handful of tech journalists to its headquarters for a very rare, roundtable meeting with three of its senior executives: Phil Schiller (Senior VP Worldwide Marketing), Craig Federighi (Senior VP Software Engineering) and John Ternus (VP Hardware Engineering).The reason? To talk about AAPL's desktop Mac roadmap.The companyupdated its MacBook Pro laptops late last year, but desktop Macs have languished with outdated specs sometimes for years. The Mac Pro was last updated in 2013, the iMac in 2015 and the Mac Mini in 2014. In the meantime, Windows PCs have received multiple upgrades and are equipped with processors and graphics cards that leave AAPL's offering in the dust - despite the Mac premium price tag.The 10 Best Stocks of the S&P 500 in Q1AndMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) has emerged as a threat for the creative professional users who traditionally bought Macs, with its newSurface Studio all-in-one PC.The situation was bad enough that AAPL staged this event to assure everyone that it hasn't abandoned the Mac or its professional users. It follows oncomments from CEO Tim Cookthat suggested APPL might be quietly working on a new Mac Pro.Apple Admits It Missed the Mark with Old Mac ProProfessionals who need a workstation-class desktop PC need a computer that can be upgraded. The Mac Pro AAPL introduced in 2013 looked cool, but its compact cylinder form factor limited upgrade options.Quoted byMashable'sLance Ulanoff (who was at the routable), Apple's Federighihad this to say about the current Mac Pro:""The Mac Pro, the current vintage that we introduced, we wanted to do something bold and different. In retrospect, it didn't well suit some of the people we wanted to reach … We designed ourselves into a bit of a thermal corner.""Phil Schiller then went on to say that AAPL engineers are designing an all new Mac Pro that supports upgradability and expansion. The Apple team admitted that this move came later than they would like, but promised that a new Mac Pro in 2018 will win back its professional users. It is also going to release a new Pro display, one made by Apple, not theLGmonitor it has been steering customers towardsince discontinuing its Thunderbolt Display last year.In the Meantime, Spec Bumps and a New iMac for Pro UsersA year is a long time to wait for a new computer - especially if you have already been waiting two or three years. But Apple has several solutions in the meantime. After noting that many professional users had been moving to high end iMacs, the company is committing to releasing a new iMac in 2017 that's aimed at pro users.Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Hits New Highs, Threatens Massive BreakoutIt won't have touch capability - AAPL isn't trying to replicate that Surface Studio - but expect high end component options for this Pro iMac like more powerful CPUs and graphics cards. And for everyone else, Apple is at leastgiving the existing Mac Pro lineup spec bumps and price cuts.Will the new Mac Pro arrive in time to save Apple's professional desktop PC market? While there have been some Windows switchers, Mac users tend to be stubbornly dedicated to the platform. The effort by Apple to be transparent about its plans, acknowledgment that it has allowed its desktop lineup to fall behind and a promise of a new Mac Pro in 2018 will hold many over.For those who can't wait, price cuts and spec bumps take at least some of the sting out of buying a current Mac Pro. And the prospect of a new iMac aimed at the professional market is intriguing.The Mac business may not count for much in an Apple that is focused on iPhone revenue, but the company is sending the message that it has no intention of abandoning the market.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceSamsung (SSNLF) Introduces the Galaxy S8 With Infinity DisplayThe New Apple Inc. iPad Strategy Is Sneakier Than You ThinkThe postApple Inc.

Happy Birthday Microsoft: 5 Fun Facts About The Software Giant's Founding;4/4/2017;"On this day in 1975, the fate of the technology industry was forever changed as long-time friends Bill Gates and Paul Allen founded MicrosoftMSFT, a once-modest software business that rose to become one of the most important and innovative companies in the world.The remarkable story of this tech pioneer begins with another important innovator, Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems (MITS), a former calculator company that begin developing computers in the mid-70s.MITS produced the first commercially successful home computer, the Altair 8800. After Gates and Allen saw the computer featured on the cover ofPopular Electronics, the pair began writing software for the device and eventually moved to New Mexico to work for the company.It was here that Gates and Allen would found Microsoft. By the end of 1978, their young company was doing more than $1 million in revenue. In 1979, Microsoft moved from New Mexico to Bellevue, Washington, a suburb of Seattle where the founders grew up.A couple of years later, Microsoft would pave the way for its domination of the operating system market by purchasing the rights to what would later become MS-DOS. Over the years, the company would develop its other infamous programs, including Word, Excel, and Windows.The rest, as they say, is history. Microsoft remains a massive tech giant, and Gates and Allen remain two of the wealthiest people on the planet. Of course, this summary is short on some of the more fun details. Everyone likes the fun details.In celebration of its 42ndbirthday, check out these five fun facts about the early days of Microsoft:1.Microsoft was not the founders' first companyGates and Allen met in high school and quickly bonded over a love for computers. The friends were able to use their school's computers for free, which led to the creation of their first business partnership, ""Traf-O-Data,"" a project focused on the efficient creation of vehicle traffic flow charts.At the time, traffic patterns were measured mechanically. Rubber hoses were laid along roads, and as cars passed over them, a small burst of air triggered a measuring device. This data was then recorded on paper tape. Gates and Allen thought they could do better. The young friends eventually designed a program and a compatible piece of hardware to create traffic charts.2.It started with a white lieWell before Bill Gates earned his reputation for being a generous philanthropist, he was apparently a bit of a fibber. Shortly after reading about the Altair 8800, a 20-year-old Gates called MITS and claimed to have a working BASIC interpreter for the computer. Gates and Allen had no such interpreter. In fact, the pair didn't even own an Altair 8800.In what could have been an attempt to call their bluff, MITS requested a demonstration of the interpreter. Allen began working on a simulator for the Altair 8800, while Gates worked on the program. The founders pulled it off, successfully demonstrating the interpreter on a real Altair 8800 a few months later.3.There used to be a hyphenAlthough the hyphen didn't last long, Microsoft was originally called ""Micro-Soft."" Allen is credited with coming up with the name, which is a combination of the words ""microcomputer"" and ""software.""In a 1995 interview withFortune, the founders revealed that Microsoft felt like the ""totally obvious"" name, but they did toy around with other names like ""Outcorporated Inc,"" ""Unlimited Ltd,"" and even ""Allen & Gates.""4.Its headquarters had humble beginningsToday, Microsoft's corporate headquarters is located at One Microsoft Way in Redmond, Washington. The multi-billion dollar campus includes a shopping mall, a soccer field, and shuttle-bus service to nearby neighborhoods. Microsoft's first offices were a bit less flashy.""Next door was a vacuum-cleaner place, then a massage parlor. To get to our offices, you had to walk past the vacuum-cleaner guy. We stayed in this motel down the road called the Sand and Sage,"" Gates toldFortune.5.Gates and Allen almost ran out of cash… thanks to   pirates.Ok fine, I'm talking about software pirates, not the sea-based swashbuckling kind. In the very early days of Microsoft, when Gates and Allen were still working with MITS, the two almost ran completely out of money because of how many people were stealing their BASIC program.According to the founders, their original contract with MITS was structured so that MITS was responsible for selling the BASIC program to their customers. When pirated copies of Gates and Allen's BASIC began floating around, MITS figured it was a waste of time to try to sell it. After a months-long legal battle, an arbitrator eventually sided with the Microsoft founders.Bottom LineRome wasn't built in a day, and neither was Microsoft. The company's incredible history fits the extraordinary impact it has had on the world, and it is fascinating to look back on the earliest days of what is now a tech powerhouse.Which Stocks are Zacks Experts Talking About?Stocks in today's headlines may be tempting buys, but how would you like a sneak peek at the stocks Zacks experts recommend?

Does Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Have Any Meaningful Growth Left?;4/4/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMy bearish call earlier this month on smartphone and technology titanApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) has not yet played out. AAPL stock is up nearly 3% since March 6, which easily bests the negative 1% return of the market as a whole since then.makeArticleAd();Besides, a month is only a blink of an eye to a long-term-minded investor. Apple's prospects over the next few years are far from certain, and the business fundamentals are what will drive Apple (and any) stock going forward.A recent note from Pacific Crest puts those fundamentals into long-term doubt.Pacific Crest, which is mildly bullish on shares - despite an ""Overweight"" rating, they have a price target of just $150, or 4% higher - sees an end to the gravy train, or at least a slowing. ""We see potential for further upside to our unit and gross profit dollar estimates in the coming iPhone cycle, but believe growth beyond that will slow substantially.""I tend to agree.A key concern for AAPL is the dominance of the Android operating system - the open-source system developed by Apple's archrivalAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL). As of the third quarter of last year, Android boasted a market share of nearly 87% (86.8%), which came despite an embarrassing recall of the Galaxy Note 7.Samsung(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) is the leading manufacturer of smart phones that run off Android.Apple's iOS operating system has seen its market share decline over the past year. It ended the third quarter of last year with a market share of 12.5%. The third largest competitor isMicrosoft Corporation's(NASDAQ:MSFT) Windows Phone. Yet its market share was only 0.3% to barely qualify it as a competitor. The rest of the market accounted for the remaining 0.4%.Despite its seemingly small operating system market share, Apple is projected to report total sales of $228 billion for all of fiscal 2017. Expectations for the next year (2018) stand at $246 billion, or annual growth of 8%. Not too bad for such a large installed base of users.Try This Apple Inc. Trade Before the CorrectionYet there are concerns about where future growth in AAPL stock will stem from.Apple fell to fifth place in China when it reported its latest quarterly results. Its market share fell to 10.8% from 12% in the previous year.Huaweiis the market leader in China.Apple is also considered only a bit player in India, where smart phone prices average less than $150. Its market share is only 10th  in India.Apple changed the smartphone space with the release of the iPhone. It also essentially invented apps that users deploy to play games, access social media and shop.But tech moves fast, and rivals have quickly gotten up to speed by copying - or should I say emulating - the best of what the iPhone has to offer. Patent litigation is working out the fine line between the two.The Future of SmartphonesAn overview of 10 predicted trends in mobile phones byPC Worldlate last year indicates that new innovations are likely to be incremental, as opposed to revolutionary. It cites new designs, such as slimmer and sleeker iPhones, perhaps a folding smartphone from Samsung, or new customization, such as mixing a phone and watch capabilities.Chips are getting faster, which helps users access data and services more quickly. USB-C ports are fast replacing micro-USB ports on Android-based phones. Charging is getting quicker, and storage is increasing. Tech moves at the speed of light, or at least tries to.This will likely make it difficult for Apple to gain any meaningful market share against Android-based rivals. Yet the total market continues to grow, and AAPL stock will benefit accordingly.Pacific Crest's Andy Hargreaves seems to think the stock needs a different type of push; namely, ""tax reform and a subsequent increase to the dividend may be necessary to drive significant upside"" in the stock.Apple's forward earnings multiple of 16 is actually quite reasonable. It's below the market average (closer to 20) and the company is still in a robustly growing market. Yet it is slightly above Apple's average multiple over the past five years.Monday Apple Rumors: AAPL Places Large Order of OLED PanelsIn addition to the growth of the overall market, Apple's higher-margin service revenue is growing briskly. Warren Buffett'sBerkshire Hathaway Inc.(NYSE:BRK.B) has also been accumulating Apple stock. There is no greater vote of confidence than the backing of the Oracle of Omaha.Bottom LineIt is valid to argue that the strength of iPhone hardware sales is highly uncertain in the coming five years. There is a very good chance that a cheap Android version sweeps across the world - especially in more emerging markets. Back in the day,Nokiadominated the worldwide cell phone market with affordable phones and a massive distribution network.That makes AAPL stock unattractive at this point.I still find thatIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) is a more compellingvalue right now. It has a lower forward earnings multiple below 13 and just boughtMobileye NV(NASDAQ:MBLY) for exposure to chips that are likely to help run self-driving cars.Alphabet also looks quite appealing. It essentially manages the Android operating system, and dominates the search engine business that has safely migrated to smart phones. GOOGL's forward P/E is 20, but the firm is growing rapidly. Sales are projected to jump 18% this year to $106 billion.As of this writing, Ryan Fuhrmann was long GOOGL and INTC.More From InvestorPlaceThe 5 Best Stocks to Buy for AprilApple Inc.

The Zacks analyst points to the company's continuing enterprise strength, benefits from the Office 365 subscription model, strong growth prospects of Azure and promising new products. The recent announcement of Xbox Game Pass, a subscription-based gaming service, will help Microsoft to win market share from the likes of GameStop.All in all, the company has emerged as a leader in the cloud space that promises momentum on a number of fronts. Estimates have been stable lately ahead of the company's fiscal Q3 earnings release. However, a strong U.S. dollar and stiff competition remain major concerns. (You canread the full research report on Microsoft here.)Shares ofTeslahave been standout performers lately, with the stock up +22.6% over the past three months vs. +0.3% gain for the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry. The company is focused on geographical expansions and acquisitions for growth. Tesla also remains on track with its Model 3 production. Tesla reported record deliveries in the first quarter of 2017.The company continues to generate a lot of passion among investors; it has an avid fan base, but also plenty of detractors. The detractors simply don't see any justification for the stock's lofty valuation given the niche nature of the product and the well-known operational and strategic headwinds facing the company. (You canread the full research report on Tesla here.)PNC Financialoutperformed the Zacks Regional Banks industry, over the last six months gaining +32.9% vs. +30.2%. The Zacks analyst likes the company's efforts to generate positive operating leverage through its cost-saving initiatives. Also, management projects revenues to rise at a mid-single digit rate in 2017, aided by loan growth. Further, its deal to acquire the commercial and vendor finance business of ECN Capital is expected to be marginally accretive to earnings in 2017.Further, given its strong balance sheet, the company's capital deployment activities are impressive. Though the company increased its prime lending rate to 4.00% following the latest Fed rate hike, margin pressure is not expected to ease drastically in the upcoming quarters. Also, stringent regulatory requirements will likely hurt the company's profitability and business flexibility in the near term.

Alphabet's Android Topples Windows as Most Preferred OS;4/4/2017;"Per Techcrunch,Alphabet Inc.'sGOOGLAndroid operating system (OS) has dethroned Microsoft'sMSFTWindows as the most popular OS in the world with respect to Internet usage.TechCrunch quoted data provided by StatCounter (a web analytics company) per which Android had a 37.93% market share in the Internet usage space in Mar 2017. This was followed by Microsoft with 37.91% share, Apple'sAAPLiOS at 13.1% and Mac OS at 5.17%.Shares of Alphabet were up 1.06% on Monday. We note that the technology giant outperformed the ZacksInternet - Servicesindustry over the last one year. While the industry gained only 7.6%, Alphabet's shares returned 13%.StatCounter noted that Android's growth was driven by growing demand for smartphones as a means to access the Internet, declining PC shipments and rising demand in Asian countries.We note that Microsoft has dominated the global OS landscape since the 1980s. Given the fact that Android entered the space just five years ago, with a market share of 2.4%, this is a phenomenal achievement. It marks an end to Microsoft's dominance in the OS space.However, as per StatCounter, the Windows OS still commands the lion's share when it comes to desktops and laptops.Our TakeAs per a CiscoCSCOreport, it is estimated that more than half of the world's population will be connected to the Internet by 2020. With PC shipments on a decline, much of this demand will be met by smartphones that enable users to access the Internet on the go.As per an IDC report, the worldwide shipment of smartphones is estimated to reach a whopping 1.9 billion by 2020 at a CAGR of 6%. Given the growth opportunity in smartphones, it is expected that the demand for OS will go up significantly. We believe that Android's dominance is a positive for Alphabet.Moreover, in emerging economies such as India where more than 90% of the smartphones have Android, there is ample scope for the company.On the other hand, although Microsoft is losing ground in the OS space in terms of Internet usage, its in-built search feature, Bing, is proving to be a strong competitor for Alphabet's search engine Google.Zacks RankAt present, Alphabet carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) while Microsoft carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

This Catalyst Can Take NVIDIA to the Cloud;4/3/2017;"The boom in data traffic is creating the need for stronger   cloud infrastructure, forcing cloud service providers (CSPs) to   upgrade their data centers to process the increasing volume and   complexity of data. Gartner estimates that public cloud   infrastructure investments will grow almost 37% this year, to   $34.6 billion, thanks to investments fromAmazon,Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) , andAlphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google to bring their data   centers up to speed.One way to tap this multibillion-dollar market is throughNVIDIA(NASDAQ: NVDA) , as its Tesla graphics processing units (GPUs)   are helping the CSPs bring raw computing power to their data   centers. As it turns out, the chipmaker's data center business   has taken off remarkably in recent quarters, outpacing the growth   in other key segments.Data Source: NVIDIA. Chart by author.makeArticleAd();In fact, the data center business is now NVIDIA's   second-largest revenue source, and it is likely that it will   continue to get bigger given the company's recent moves in this   space.NVIDIA is gaining from GPU adoption in the cloudA huge amount of data is being generated thanks to connected   cars and other Internet of Things devices.IntelCEO Brian Krzanich believes that a single autonomous car could   generate 4,000 gigabytes of data daily if driven for just one   hour, thanks to all the sensors and cameras installed.Machina Research, on the other hand, forecasts that the number of connected   devices will grow over fourfold, to 27 billion, by 2025.This is going to create a big challenge for CSPs in   transferring the data from the cloud to the data center, with   Gartner forecasting that 25% of the data generated will go to   waste even before it is analyzed. NVIDIA, however, has a solution   for the CSPs with its Tesla GPUs that are specifically aimed at   this market.Image source: NVIDIA.The Tesla GPUs accelerate a data center's computing power,   enabling service providers to process huge data sets at a   fraction of the cost required to build a new facility, which   would previously have been required to analyze the same amount of   data. NVIDIA does this by allowing service providers to replace   central processing units with its high-performance GPUs that can   deliver a fivefold boost in computational power and slash costs   by 60%.Not surprisingly, Alphabet has decided to use the chipmaker's   Tesla K80 GPUs on the Google Cloud Platform to offer   deep-learning capabilities to its users. Google Cloud users can   now use up to eight GPUs to perform intensive tasks such as   high-performance data analysis, seismic analysis, and video   transcoding.Google is going to charge $0.70 per hour for each K80 GPU in   the U.S. and $0.77 per hour in Asia and Europe, allowing users to   carry out deep-learning operations without any significant   capital investment. What's more,Tencenthas also decided to use NVIDIA's Tesla P100 and P40 GPU   accelerators to give artificial intelligence (AI) computing   capabilities to its enterprise customers, giving the chipmaker   access to China's booming public cloud-infrastructure market.NVIDIA is targeting AI cloud computingAI cloud computing is fast gaining traction thanks to the   advent of the Internet of Things and connected cars that require   autonomous decision making based on data generated, and NVIDIA   does not want to miss the gravy train. The chipmaker recently   partnered with Microsoft to bring to market a hyperscale GPU   accelerator aimed at AI cloud computing applications.NVIDIA and Microsoft expect their framework -- the HGX-1 -- to   be used in healthcare, self-driving cars, and voice recognition,   among others, as it is positioned as the standard architecture   for AI cloud computing. The HGX-1 is based on an open-source,   modular design, indicating that it is scalable in nature since it   comes with eight Tesla GPUs that can connect to the central   processing unit depending on the workload.NVIDIA has made a smart move by tying up with Microsoft to   develop an AI cloud computing solution as the latter's Azure   cloud service is growing at a faster pace than the market leader.   Amazon Web Services -- the e-commerce giant's cloud computing   services subsidiary -- is currently the market leader in this   space, but Microsoft's Azure cloud could overtake it in a couple   of years according to aMorgan Stanleysurvey.In all, NVIDIA's data center business has a lot of room for   growth as the company's GPUs will play a mission-critical role in   cloud computing thanks to the chipmaker's deep-learning and AI   capabilities. More important, the company is partnering with the   key players to sustain its rapid growth in this space.Find out why Nvidiais one of the 10 best stocks to buy nowMotley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent       more than a decade beating the market.

GameStop: Is This Game Still Worth Playing?;4/3/2017;"Recently,GameStop Corp.(GME) has taken a beating in the market with the release of some very unflattering news. As we all know, the stock market is a very unforgiving place.GameStop came across my radar a few years ago when I was doing my regular screening looking for new opportunities. Until recently, I had not pulled the trigger on the company, but after digging into it a little more it appeared to be a great opportunity. In the light of recent news, I am wondering if I made a good decision or walked into a value trap.I admit I was first attracted to the 6% dividend yield, which was very enticing. In addition to the low price-earnings (P/E) ratio as well as other financial strengths, it appeared this was a great opportunity.makeArticleAd();In this article, I will take a look at my findings again, re-evaluate my decision to buy and whether or not to stay in at this point or to sell and just cut my losses.Retail is a brutal environment and the competition can be fierce. With the recent announcement ofMicrosoft Corp.'s (MSFT) Xbox's subscription service, there has been a lot of concern among GameStop investors in how this will affect the company long term.Let's take a look.Business overviewFounded in 1994 in Grapevine, Texas, GameStop operates more than 7,600 stores now. These stores are located in the U.S., Australia, Canada and Europe.Gamestop's primary business is selling new and used video game hardware and software. This includes accessories such as gaming consoles, controllers, headsets and memory cards.Segments:Source: GameStop Investor PresentationVideo Game Hardware/Software: 49.58%Preowned: 22.34%Accessories: 7.83%Digital: 1.87%Technology Brands: 8.4%Other: 2.96%Obviously, videos make up a very large percentage of sales with the current numbers being 71.92% of its total sales.In recent years, GameStop has attempted to diversify the business. It has branched out into the consumer electronics business by selling smartphones and tablets.In addition, it launched Spring Mobile, where it recently became the largest owner ofAT&T(T) wireless retail stores outside of AT&T.GameStop also partnered withApple(AAPL) to open 72 Simply Mac stores, which serve as tech support outlets for Apple products.The company now has a goal of reducing its reliance on video game sales to less than 50% of revenue. The company stated in its most recent earnings call that revenue from technology and collectibles make up 39% of its sales. So it is not there yet, but is on the way.In 2016, the company saw non-physical gaming revenues of over $2 billion. So while GameStop has changed its focus, it is still tied to the physical gaming hardware, which is now an industry that is in decline.Source: GameStop Investor PresentationIn addition to the increase in revenue from sources other than video games, the company recently announced it will be reducing the store count by 150 stores. By eliminating underperforming stores, it will cut overheads and other costs. Thus far, this has worked.This is not unlike other retail stores, who are all reducing store counts. Even mightyWal-Mart(WMT) is lowering its store count.In addition, GameStop also owns a diverse portfolio of video game websites such as Ebgames.com, Kongragate.com and Thinkgeek.com.All the changes in direction are a recognition by management that changes are needed if the company is going to survive. And they are implementing them, although maybe not as fast as some investors would like.Business analysisFirst, let's take a look at some of the numbers that have driven the price down recently.Source: Intrinsic Value FormulaSource: Intrinsic Value FormulaWith the sales growth pretty stagnant for the last six years and free cash flow stagnant as well, there has been an increase in earnings per share and free cash flow per share because of the very aggressive share buybacks that have been instituted.Source: Intrinsic Value FormulaAs the company has reduced the share count, it has helped elevate the earnings per share and free cash flow per share, even when the real dollar amounts have not grown that much.Other bad news came during the latest earnings release. It was revealed that same-store sales were down 16.3% for fourth-quarter 2016 and down 11% for fiscal 2016. In addition, adjusted EPS were down 0.8% at $2.38 for fourth-quarter 2016 and down 3.3% at $3.77 for fiscal 2016.Additionally, GameStop guided down for 2017 as well, with sales estimated down 2% and same-store sales down 5% to even. Net income and earnings per share were guided down to $320 million and $3.10 respectively. Also guided down were video sales and hardware.The big news recently was Microsoft announced its new Game Pass, which will allow users to access 100 of the most popular older Xbox One and Xbox 360 games for a $9.99 monthly subscription.In addition to this news, subscribers will also be able to buy these games at a 20% discount to their retail price.Of course, this will hit GameStop right in the bottom line because it generates over 30% of its gross profit from older game sales.We all know the video game industry is shifting away from physical games and toward downloads. With Microsoft andSony(SNE) moving toward subscription services, this is no surprise.The surprise was that Wall Street reacted very badly to this news and the price dropped 10% the day of the announcement.Good newsThe Technology Brands segment achieved its goal of adjusted operating earnings for 2016. It came in at 90.2 million, which was a 216% increase over 2015.In addition, the Collectibles business was able to meet its revenue target of $494.1 million in 2016.As stated previously, the company is moving toward a goal of earnings from businesses beyond physical games of 50%. In 2016, it achieved non-physical gaming businesses comprising 36.9% of total adjusted operating earnings.GameStop also acquired 511 Technology Brands stores, ending the year with 1,522 stores and as AT&T's largest authorized retailer.Technology's brand sales increased 52.4% for the full year. Adjusted operating earnings grew 216.4%.Other good news was the newNintendo(TSE:7974) Switch sold out in the three major shipments the company received in a matter of hours.This is a prospect most people have not considered. The impact of new hardware releases by Sony and Microsoft and what they could do for the company over the next few years.Gamers do not want to order new consoles online, they want it now or on launch day. They would rather get it in store than risk waiting for it to be delivered.Key risksGameStop's race to reinvent itself is the biggest risk it faces. It is competing against bigger, better-capitalized companies like Microsoft and Sony in the realm of digital video game sales and rentals.There is also the turnaround to consider. GameStop is branching out into businesses that are no-moat, highly commoditized ones.Selling smartphones and tablets did not work out so well for Radio Shack, who tried the same strategy before filing for bankruptcy.In addition, its efforts with the collectibles division are going to run into difficulties when competing againsteBay(EBAY). It will not be able to achieve the same kinds of scale or network effects eBay enjoys.Plus, its efforts to compete in the digital video game subscription platforms are going to run into trouble. Because of the size of its competitors, GameStop's only avenue is to compete on price, which lowers the profit margins and drives free cash flow down.All of these efforts could come at the cost of profitability, which could be catastrophic in the long run.The decrease in profitability has pushed the company into increasing its debt to help fund some of the turnaround efforts. With its junk bond rating of BB in this rising rate environment, it means any increase in debt becomes that much more expensive.GameStop's long-term success hinges on its ability to complete the turnaround it has begun. But with the increased reliance on debt to help fund that turnaround, it has led to an increased risk profile for the company.As the earnings and cash flows continue to decline, the company's current tactic of taking on more debt to fund its turnaround will result in continued deterioration of its balance sheet. This forces GameStop to pay 6% to 7% interest on its bonds because of its junk bond rating.If the interest rates continue to rise, it could make it extremely difficult to execute its turnaround plans.The last risk is a major liability it faces every year, which would be rent payments for the retail stores it leases. GameStop has paid over $380 million per year in rental expenses each of the last three years.These leases are non-cancellable agreements that will be a drag on its efforts to establish a turnaround.State of the dividendWithout a doubt, the dividend is one of the more attractive aspects of GameStop.The company is currently offering a dividend with a yield of 7.29%, which is a reflection of the depressed stock price. The rate of the dividend is $1.52 a year, which is quite generous for a company this size.GameStop has raised its dividend every year since it started paying one in 2012. It has risen from 80 cents a share in 2012 to the current rate of $1.52 a share. Indeed, GameStop has raised the dividend 10.4% over the last three years.Additionally, the payout ratio for the dividend is 44%, which is a comfortable number given the state of the company. This payout ratio gives some comfort that the dividend is in no immediate danger of being cut.One note to be aware of. As the earnings and free cash flow margins continue to be squeezed with the declining sales, you will likely continue to see rising payout ratios, which could spell trouble for the dividend.Right now the balance sheet is strong, but it has taken some hits in the last few years. GameStop has sufficient cash on the balance sheet to continue paying the current dividend for two years.All these factors lead me to believe the dividend is now not in danger of being cut or suspended. But it is worth keeping an eye on until the turnaround shows more signs of being successful.ValuationThe past year has been brutal for GameStop with Wall Street just hammering the stock. Shares have dropped 21% for the year compared to the 17% increase experienced in the market.This has led to GameStop being one of the cheapest stocks on Wall Street, both from a P/E and dividend yield perspective.The trailing 12-month P/E is 6.45, which is substantially lower than itshistoricalP/E of 10.8. In fact, it is now lower than 93% of all specialty retailers.Currently, the dividend yield is 6.92%, which is quite a bit higher than the company's historical yield of 3.1%. In fact, it doubles its historical yield. Some of that, of course, is due to the recent drop in share price.According to GuruFocus, using a DCF based on free cash flow yields a price of $52.32. A DCF based on earnings yields a price $36.39.Using the earnings based valuation would give you a 40% margin of safety.Final thoughtsThere are certainly quite a few points to be made for a bearish case for GameStop, and I am cognizant of those and understand all the points.Certainly Wall Street reacted very violently to the negative news that came out during the most recent earnings call. In fact, the day of the news reports, the stock was down 12% at one point in the day. No one should have been surprised by these results as the sentiment surrounding the company was terrible going into the earnings call.Ironically, it rallied a few days later and is back to $21.95. One wonders if it will continue to rally to its earlier heights. As recently as last November, it took a similar dive only to rebound shortly thereafter.Some points to keep in mind when considering this stock. First, the company does not need to expand and become the next retail giant. It just needs to continue to keep its cash flows intact and survive this turnaround.Second, the turnaround is well under way with the recent news the company has begun the change from a video game retailer to a more diversified company.There has been a lot of focus on the very poor holiday sales the company reported, but as someone so astutely reported, GameStop experiences a holiday season whenever a new console is released. This makes GameStop much more cyclical than your typical retailer and could help explain the poor holiday season sales.This a profitable company that has demonstrated it is shareholder friendly with the continued buybacks and dividend increases.There is some concern about the dividend being unsustainable, but the current strength of the balance sheet should allow the company to continue the current payout ratio.These are just a few of the reasons why I remain bullish on GameStop. I am long the company and believe in its efforts to adapt the company to its current situation.I am also humble enough to understand it faces an uphill battle. This will not be easy, but I believe it will accomplish the goal.I know there is some concern GameStop is headed in the same direction as Blockbuster. while that is certainly a possibility, I think we should look at GameStop on its merits and the many ways it is developing to unlock value for its shareholders.GameStop's future returns will consist of dividends and earnings growth.2% sales growth based on analysts' reports7% dividend yield1% earnings growth from share repurchasesThanks in large to its very high dividend yield, GameStop could generate 10% annualized returns even with the very poor earnings growth projections.Although I am long the company, I am not immune to some of the warning signs that are looming out there. I believe the company has begun a turnaround, however, which is already well under way.As the company's price continues to flounder, I will take advantage of any dips to add to my position.Disclosure: I am long GameStop.

Top Research Reports for Today: MSFT, TSLA, PNC;4/3/2017;"makeZacksArticleAd();Monday, April 3, 2017Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Microsoft (MSFT), Tesla (TSLA) and PNC Financial (PNC).Microsoftshares lagged the Zacks Tech sector through the fall, but have led the way over the last six months (up +15.3% versus +8.9%) on greater appreciation for the company's reorganization and repositioning. The Zacks analyst points to the company's continuing enterprise strength, benefits from the Office 365 subscription model, strong growth prospects of Azure and promising new products. The recent announcement of Xbox Game Pass, a subscription-based gaming service, will help Microsoft to win market share from the likes of GameStop.All in all, the company has emerged as a leader in the cloud space that promises momentum on a number of fronts. Estimates have been stable lately ahead of the company's fiscal Q3 earnings release. However, a strong U.S. dollar and stiff competition remain major concerns. (You canread the full research report onMicrosoft here.)Shares ofTeslahave been standout performers lately, with the stock up +22.6% over the past three months vs. +0.3% gain for the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry. The company is focused on geographical expansions and acquisitions for growth. Tesla also remains on track with its Model 3 production. Tesla reported record deliveries in the first quarter of 2017.The company continues to generate a lot of passion among investors; it has an avid fan base, but also plenty of detractors. The detractors simply don't see any justification for the stock's lofty valuation given the niche nature of the product and the well-known operational and strategic headwinds facing the company. (You canread the full research report onTeslahere.)PNC Financialoutperformed the Zacks Regional Banks industry, over the last six months gaining +32.9% vs. +30.2%. The Zacks analyst likes the company's efforts to generate positive operating leverage through its cost-saving initiatives. Also, management projects revenues to rise at a mid-single digit rate in 2017, aided by loan growth. Further, its deal to acquire the commercial and vendor finance business of ECN Capital is expected to be marginally accretive to earnings in 2017.Further, given its strong balance sheet, the company's capital deployment activities are impressive. Though the company increased its prime lending rate to 4.00% following the latest Fed rate hike, margin pressure is not expected to ease drastically in the upcoming quarters. Also, stringent regulatory requirements will likely hurt the company's profitability and business flexibility in the near term.

Microsoft to Shut CodePlex to Focus on Cloud Opportunity;4/3/2017;"Microsoft Corporation'sMSFTvice president for Cloud Developer Services, Brian Harry announced in a blog post that the company will pull the plug on CodePlex, a website for code sharing and project hosting. The move comes in the wake of intensifying competition from GitHub, spam epidemic and a decline in the number of users over the last 30 days.CodePlex has discontinued the creation of new projects on the platform. Moreover, the website will become a read-only platform by October, followed by a complete shutdown on Dec 15, 2017.However, before the shutdown and the decommissioning of the CodePlex platform, Microsoft will take a complete and final backup of the site that will allow users to browse through the published projects.Although shares of Microsoft were up only marginally (+0.23%) on Friday following the announcement, we note that, shares of the company have underperformed the ZacksComputer - Softwareindustry over the last one year. While the industry gained 19.7%, the stock registered growth of 19.0%.The underperformance of the stock could be due to stiff competition in the cloud space and the PC market.However, we expect the stock to rebound in the rest of 2017 given such strategical moves being made from the company's end.Focus Remains on CloudWith Satya Nadella at the helm, Microsoft remains focused on its ""cloud first, mobile first"" motto and the recent announcement is another step in that direction. The CodePlex shutter indicatesMicrosoft's focus on growing its core businesses i.e. cloud and Office 365.We believe that Microsoft's partnership with GitHub allows the company free-up resources previously engaged with the CodePlex.Moreover, many open source codes are now being built to work in the cloud architecture, which could drive the demand for Microsoft's cloud platform Azure.Notably, during the last reported quarter, Microsoft joined the Linux Foundation and announced a new Azure partnership with Open AI which again could drive further adoptions of Azure.As per an IDC report, worldwide spending on public cloud is estimated to reach a whopping $203.4 billion by 2020 at a CAGR of 21.5%. We hope that Microsoft's increasing collaborations with open source providers will help it to become a dominant player in the long run.However, we note that competition is fierce in the cloud space with the presence of other major players such as Amazon'sAMZNAWS, IBM Corp'sIBMIBM Cloud and Alphabet'sGOOGLGoogle Cloud Platform.Zacks RankAt present, Microsoft carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Apple Inc. (AAPL) Will Develop Its Own iPhone Graphics Chip;4/3/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) already designs its own CPUs for the iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch. AAPL licenses the iPhone's PowerVR GPU - graphics processing unit - from British chipmakerImagination Technologies(OTCMKTS:IGNMF).makeArticleAd();Source: AppleDespite the long-term relationship (and Apple owning a stake in the company), AAPL has decided to go it alone on the iPhone graphics chip. Imagination Technologies confirmed the bad news this morning, triggering a panic sell-off that saw the company's shares plummet by over 60%.AAPL's Long Relationship with Imagination TechnologiesApple has been licensing the iPhone GPU from Imagination Technologies since 2008. Its dependence on the company to provide the iPhone graphics chip led Apple to boost its investment in its graphics partner to a 10% stake in 2009.In 2014, it was announced thatApple had signed an extended deal with Imagination Technologies, agreeing to continue using its PowerVR GPUs in iPhones for a multiyear period. As the British chipmaker's largest client, this was a big deal.However, despite the new licensing deal, the relationship between the two companies began to deteriorate. Last year,MacRumorsreported Apple confirmed it hadbeen in talks to acquire Imagination Technologiesoutright, but decided to pass. From there, AAPL began hiring talent from the chipmaker, and was rumored to be establishing a UK office to develop its own iPhone graphics chip.Apple to Design Its Own iPhone Graphics ChipThose rumors became fact this morning when Imagination Technologiesposted a statementon its website confirming Apple's move:""Imagination Technologies Group … has been notified by Apple Inc. (""Apple""), its largest customer, that Apple is of a view that it will no longer use the Group's intellectual property in its new products in 15 months to two years time, and as such will not be eligible for royalty payments under the current license and royalty agreement.""The fallout was immediate, with Imagination Technologies stock dropping over 68% within hours.Designing a new iPhone GPU from scratch will be a challenge - especially without running into IP issues and while using a team with members from AAPL's former long-term partner. Imagination Technologies notes this on its statement, saying: ""Imagination believes that it would be extremely challenging to design a brand new GPU architecture from basics without infringing its intellectual property rights.""However, Apple designs its own A-series CPUs for iOS devices, usingARM Holdingstechnology. Its success on this front shows that AAPL engineers can build customized chips that compete with the best. Ditching PowerVR for its own in-house iPhone graphics chip could give Apple a significant edge over the Android competition using off-the-shelf GPUs.The Apple Effect Can Turn Around and Bite You…As Imagination Technologies is discovering, working with AAPL can be risky. There is potential for huge rewards. But there is also the danger that Apple will decide technology is too important to be left with a third party and bring it in-house. Countless app developers have found this out the hard waywhen iOS gains new features that effectively replaces them.GT Advanced Technologies(OTCMKTS:GTATQ) has seen the dark side of the Apple Effect. That company was tapped by AAPL to manufacture sapphire crystals for future iPhone use. The Apple deal meant a huge ramp-up for mass production. Unable to meet AAPL's demands, rather than celebrate a big payday, the company was forced todeclare bankruptcy in 2014.Trade Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock Before Its Major RallyThe worst-case scenario here for Imagination Technologies is that Apple does go it alone and develops its own in-house iPhone graphics chip. Half of the company's revenue disappears within two years. The most positive read is one that was spiked out on today's statement:""Apple's notification has led Imagination to discuss with Apple potential alternative commercial arrangements for the current license and royalty agreement.""In other words, for Imagination Technologies the best case scenario is renegotiating its deal, convincing Apple to stay be offering more favorable terms.Squeezing its suppliersis another move AAPL is well known for and this movecouldbe just a bargaining tactic. Either way -designing its own iPhone GPU or continuing to use the PowerVR chip for less money- Apple comes out ahead. It always does…As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace7 'Best of the Best' Stocks to Buy for the Second QuarterThe 7 Best Stocks to Buy for an Income-Rich RetirementBlackBerry Ltd (BBRY) Stock Is Being Underestimated by InvestorsThe postApple Inc.

Trade Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock Before Its Major Rally;4/3/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsStill known for its ubiquitous Windows desktop software,Microsoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) broke ground in 2016 as the leader in cloud services. Microsoft's Azure cloud services topped $14 billion in revenue last year, compared to $12.2 billion forAmazon.com, Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AMZN) cloud services.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockAs a result, Microsoft stock rallied more than 17% in 2016, but this year could be even bigger as the software giant takes aim at artificial intelligence.The AI move is major for Microsoft, as it is for the company's partner:Adobe Systems Incorporated(NASDAQ:ADBE). And the breakout for MSFT stock could start soon.The duo recently announced theintegration of Adobe Campaign and Microsoft Dynamics 365, with the result allowing users to assemble data and make business decisions in a way that wasn't previously possible with each separate platform.What's more, you can expect business-centric AI to take off rapidly in 2017, as bothsalesforce.com, inc.(NYSE:CRM) and Amazon have partnered up to integrate Salesforce'sbusiness AI Einstein with Amazon Connect.Click to EnlargeWith competition heating up on the business AI front, it's only a matter of time before Wall Street takes notice, and Microsoft stock is positioned to run.Technically, the shares have recovered nicely after retreating from their late-January highs.MSFT has since rallied higher along support at its rising 50-day moving average, and Microsoft stock is once again poised to test resistance at $66. A breakout here could mark the start of MSFT's next upleg in its longer-term rally that began in early 2016.Sentiment is certainly supportive when it comes to MSFT. According to data from Thomson/First Call, 24 of the 34 brokerage firms following Microsoft stock rate it a ""buy"" or better, leaving room for potential upgrades as the business AI sector gains steam.3 Soaring Semiconductor Stocks Still Worth BuyingWhat's more, there is also room for price-target increases for Microsoft stock. Currently, the 12-month consensus price target rests at $69.42, representing a meager premium of only about 5.4% to Friday's close. Upgrades or price-target increases could bring additional buyers to the table for Microsoft stock.Turning to the options pits, Microsoft stock options traders are also adjusting their targets higher for the shares. Currently, the April put/call open interest ratio for MSFT rests at 0.70, down considerably from readings above 1.0 in early March. Furthermore, MSFT is already trading north of peak April call OI of 59,000 contracts at $65, and interest is building at $67.50 as options traders react to the possibility of a MSFT breakout above $66.Meanwhile, April implieds are currently well below historicals for Microsoft stock, and are pricing in a potential move of only about 1.7% for MSFT ahead of April expiration. In other words, Microsoft options are cheap right now. Currently, the upper bound lies near $66.88, while the lower bound lies at about $64.62.2 Trades for Microsoft StockCall Spread:Traders looking to get in on a breakout above $66 might want to consider an April $66/$67 bull call spread. At last check, this spread was offered at 33 cents, or $33 per pair of contracts. Breakeven lies at $66.33, while a maximum profit of 67 cents, or $67 per pair of contracts, is possible if Microsoft stock closes at or above $67 when these options expire.Put Sell:While low premiums will cut into your return, traders with a more neutral outlook for MSFT over the short term might want to consider an April $64 put sell. At last check, the $64 put was bid at 16 cents, or $16 per contract.Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock Is More Risk Than Reward NowAs long as MSFT stock trades above $64 through April expiration, traders pursuing this strategy will keep the $16 premium. If MSFT trades below $64 ahead of expiration, however, you could be assigned 100 shares for each contract sold at a price of $64 per share.As of this writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceThe 10 Best Stocks of the S&P 500 in Q1Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Is a No-Doubt Buy After Deliveries Beat3 Blue-Chip Technology Stocks That Will Break Through the CeilingThe postTrade Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock Before Its Major Rallyappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Himax Technologies History: Everything Investors Need to Know;4/2/2017;"Himax Technologies(NASDAQ: HIMX) has been publicly traded since 2006, and since   then thefabless semiconductor companyhas experienced a few massive stock price run-ups and a few   substantial drops as well. Investors who bought Himax right   when the company went public have seen their investment gain just   over 4%.To find out how the company might perform in the near future   let's take a quick look at what's caused Himax's stock to pop --   and dip -- and if the company is likely to experience more of the   same going forward.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();Himax's share price historyAs you can see from the chart below, Himax's share price   history has been on a wild ride since mid-2013, after   experiencing a slow decline following its IPO.Himax's stock price began skyrocketing in 2013 on news thatAlphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google was implementing some of   Himax's technology into its ill-fated Google Glass device. Google   even took a 6.3% stake in the company at the time, with the   option of grabbing 14.8% of Himax if wanted it -- which Google   eventually decided against .Image source:YCharts.During that time the company's stock hit an all-time high,   only to plummet after things with Google and its Glass device   didn't pan out.Then, near the beginning of 2016, investors started getting   excited about Himax's prospects in the AR space again, this time   on hopes thatMicrosoft's(NASDAQ: MSFT) Hololens would bring Himax's share price huge   gains. Unfortunately, the company faced a similar situation as in   the past when the Hololens failed to bring huge gains for Himax.   Investors began dumping the stock after a few analysts cut their   buy ratings on news that Hololens shipments were lower than   expected.Looking aheadMuch of Himax's prospects are being built around the company's   ability to supply technology for its AR customers. On Himax's   recent earning call, CEO Jordan Wu said that,Having invested in related technologies for over 15 years,     we are uniquely positioned as the provider of choice for micro     display and related optics, both of which [are] critical     enablers to AR devices.The company is ramping up for more sales of its liquid   crystals on silicon (LCOS) and wafer-level optics (WLO)   products for AR devices after ramping up production for both   later this year and into 2018.Himax says that the ramp-up is because its AR customers are   looking to their next generation devices, and that Himax's tech   will benefit from that. While this certainly could be true, it   also feels a little like 2013 all over again. Betting on AR --   which is still an unproven market -- could take a long time to   pay off for the company.Northland Capital Markets' Tom Sepenzis wrote in a recent   investor note (republishedon Barron's):Augmented reality remains the largest potential for HIMX     with its LCOS and WLO products, but the market has hit another     stumbling block as prices remain prohibitive for consumers. We     believe that this will limit the number of new AR devices for     the next 12-24 months....AR is expected to be worth $117 billion by 2022, according to   Markets and Markets research. Investors can look to Himax's past   share price volatility and see that betting on this stock's AR   future can turn out badly. A better approach may be to wait a   little while longer and see if Himax's technology investments   bare some fruit later this year and next, and then see how well   that positions the company in the AR space.Right now, investing in Himax looks like a bet on both its   unproven prospects in ARandthat the augmented reality market will grow quickly. Himax's   history has shown that investors can easily get caught up in the   stock's future potential, while disregarding the hurdles the   company faces.10 stocks we like better than Himax     TechnologiesWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Will This Overlooked Cloud Stock Grow 60% by 2018?;4/1/2017;"Shares of cloud storage providerBox(NYSE: BOX) rallied 35% over the past 12 months, but the stock   hovers just 18% above its IPO price of $14. That's because after   hitting $23 on its first trading day in Jan. 2015, Box plunged   below $10 last February before gradually recovering to the   mid-teens.Despite that lackluster performance, Drexel Hamilton analyst   Brian White recently reiterated his ""Buy"" rating on the stock and   his price target of $26 -- which  represents a near-60%   rally from its current price. White claims that Box looks cheap   with an EV/Sales ratio of 3.3 based on its calendar 2018 (fiscal   2019) expectations. Is that ""low"" valuation enough to justify   buying Box, or should investors ignore this overlooked cloud   stock?Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();What are Box's key strengths?Box provides cloud storage and associated services to over   71,000 businesses, including the majority of the Fortune 500   companies. Its major customers include industrial behemothGeneral Electricand  pharmaceutical giantAstraZeneca. That market presence is impressive, since the cloud storage   market is filled with bigger players likeAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN),Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT), andAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) 's Google.Despite those challenges, Box has posted double-digit sales   growth ever since its IPO. Its revenue rose  32% to $398.6   million in fiscal 2017, and it expects another 25%-26% growth   this year. Much of that growth comes from the addition of new   customers, the introduction of add-on cloud services (like   security and analytics) which boost its revenue per customer, and   integration partnerships with companies like Microsoft,Salesforce, andIBM. Deferred revenue, a key indicator of forward demand, rose 30%   to $242 million at the end of fiscal 2017.What are Box's key weaknesses?Like many high-growth tech companies, Box's robust revenue   growth doesn't trickle down to any profits. However, its non-GAAP   loss narrowed from $1.16 per share in 2016 to $0.56. During that   period, its GAAP loss narrowed from $1.67 to $1.19. That GAAP   loss was heavily weighed down by stock-based compensation   expenses, which gobbled up 20% of Box's revenues during the   year.Wall Street expects Box to report non-GAAP losses this yearandnext year -- although those losses are expected to continue   narrowing. Box faces a dilemma which many cloud SaaS (software as   a service) companies face -- competition keeps price expectations   low, but the cost of securing new customers and developing new   services remains high. We can clearly see that impact in its   operating margins:Source:YChartsThe ongoing cloud storage pricing war  between Amazon,   Microsoft, and Google limits Box's ability to raise prices.   However, all three companies can afford to use cloud storage   services as a loss leader to expand their ecosystems. Box has   neither the scale nor ecosystem to follow suit -- so it could   eventually lose customers to those tech giants' bundling   strategies.Box finished 2017 with a negative free cash flow (FCF) of   $24.8 million. That marked a big improvement from its negative   FCF of $116.3 million in 2016, and Box achieved its first quarter   of positive free cash flow ($10.2 million) during the fourth   quarter. However, Box isn't expected to achieve a full-year   positive FCF anytime soon, and a negative FCF could prevent Box   from scaling up to widen its moat against bigger challengers.What do the valuations say?Drexel Hamilton's bullish view on Box is based on the notion   that an EV/Sales ratio of 3.3 is cheap for a company with its   growth figures. For example, two other high-growth cloud service   stocks withcomparable sales growth--TwilioandVeeva-- have respective EV/Sales ratios of 4.6 and 8.2 based on   next year's projected revenues. It's also lower than the current   industry average of 4.8 for application software makers.Assuming that Box is ""fairly valued"" with an EV/Sales ratio   between Twilio and Veeva's, it's certainlypossiblethat Box could rise to White's price target of $26. However, what   bothers me about that estimate is that it's based on a long-range   forecast, and a lot can change in the cloud storage industry   within two years. If Amazon, Microsoft, and Google continue   slashing prices and piling on more features, Box could struggle   to retain its top customers.The key takeawayI think Box has solid sales growth, and its growing list of   big enterprise customers indicate that it has a lot of staying   power. It also did a great job at adding more services and   partnerships, narrowing its losses, and achieving positive free   cash flow last quarter.However, claiming Box can rise 60% based on next year's sales   estimates is a bit too optimistic. It's hard to tell how much   storage prices will fall over the following year, and Box CEO   Aaron Levie even once admitted that  cloud storage would   likely be ""free and infinite"" in the future. Therefore, investors   should temper their expectations for Box based on future   developments across the cloud market.10 stocks we like better than BoxWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

The King of Beers Joins the Renewable Energy Bandwagon;4/1/2017;"As politicians and interest groups debate the future of   climate change policies and renewable energy mandates across the   country, a big power in the world of energy is making its   strategy well-known. The business community has made a big   commitment to transform their businesses to renewable energy,   which is now driving wind and solar investment around the   world.The latest to make a 100% renewable electricity commitment isAnheuser-Busch InBev(NYSE: BUD) , the world's biggest beer maker, which said on   Monday that it will make the transition by 2025. Make no mistake,   AB-InBev isn't suddenly an environmentally focused company.   They're making an economic decision to buy renewable energy. It's   a trend the corporate world is taking very seriously.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();AB-InBev's renewable playBelow is the infographic AB-InBev used to announce its   renewable energy commitment. It highlights the move from 7%   renewable energy to 100% by 2025 and shines a light on Mexico as   a focus.Image source: AB-InBev.The Mexico announcement is interesting because the country   held two renewable energy auctions in 2016 that got very   favorable terms. A year ago, bids were announced at 5.07 cents   per kilowatt-hour (kWh) of electricity and by October bids   averaged 3.35 cents per kWh for clean energy. This compares to   average retail electricity prices of about 12 cents per kWh, so   renewable energy is very economical for big companies.And these projects will be completed by the end of the decade,   so the price AB-InBev will pay by 2025 will be lower than the   contracts signed in 2016. In total, the announcement says some 6   terawatt-hours, or around 3 gigawatts (GW) of solar, will produce   energy for AB-InBev.Corporate America loves renewable energyAB-InBev isn't the first company to take interest in renewable   energy. In the U.S.,Target(NYSE: TGT) andWal-Mart(NYSE: WMT) are the two biggest corporate solar users, with 147.5   MW and 145.0 MW, respectively, according toSEIA's Solar Means Business 2016 report.Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) says it has been100% powered by renewable energy since 2014andAlphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google says it willreach that level in 2017.Companies aren't just looking at renewable energy as a PR   move; they're looking at it as a way to save money. Target   and Wal-Mart are primarily installing solar directly on their   rooftops, reducing electricity bills from the utility. And data   centers byApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) , Microsoft, and Alphabet are now installing   renewable energy nearby so they can use renewable energy   directly. Apple has co-located nearly 100 MW of solar at data   centers in North Carolina and Nevada with another 100 MW in   development. Microsoft recently signed a deal to buy energy from   237 MW of wind farms in Wyoming and Kansas to power a Wyoming   data center. Alphabet has invested $2.5 billion in renewable   energy projects to power its business. This is becoming big   business for wind and solar companies.Corporate buys are the new renewable driverFor over a decade, renewable energy has been driven by   mandates and subsidies around the world, and in many places, it   still is today. But costs have come down so far that corporations   are now looking at it as a way to save money on their operations   long-term. And that'll only drive more wind and solar   installations as more companies join the renewable energy   bandwagon.10 stocks we like better than Anheuser-Busch InBev     NVWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

This Top Stock Mutual Fund Cheers Retirement Investors With Gains;3/31/2017;"A tail wind has kicked up this calendar year behind $7.5   billion American Century Growth Fund (TWCGX). That's nice news for investors holding the fund inretirement accountsand other portfolios. The fund's 9.93% gain this year going   into Thursday topped 73% of the fund's large-cap growth rivals   tracked by Morningstar Inc. That's a step up from the 67% of   peers the fund outperformed over the trailing 12 months with a   16.40% return.Managers Gregory Woodhams and Justin Brown pick stocks   individually and not based on sectors, but their sector weights   show where they expect to find leaders. Technology was their top   sector as of Jan. 31, with a 34% weighting. Consumer   discretionary was next with 20%.Tech titansAlphabet(GOOGL),Apple(AAPL) andMicrosoft(MSFT) - the fund's first, third and fifth largest holdings   - illustrate that appetite. Alphabet is up 7% so far this   year. Apple is up 24%. Microsoft is up 5%. Together they   account for about 14% of the fund's assets.makeArticleAd();Several top new buys as of Dec. 31 also belonged to the tech   sector. Among those was chipmakerBroadcom(AVGO), which is up 25% so far this year. The stock has a   highest-possible Comp Rating of 99.IBD'S TAKE:Broadcom is ranked No. 1 in the No. 37-rated     Electronics-Semiconductor Fabless industry group. It has four     quarters in a row of accelerating earnings per share growth.     See how its additional easy-to-understanding fundamental and     technical data stack up against rivals' atIBD's Stock Checkup.Another top new buy wasActivision Blizzard(ATVI), which is up 39% this year. The video game stock is ranked   No. 2 in IBD's Computer Software-Gaming group, thanks in part to   traits like its very strong 97 Comp Rating. In addition, the   stock is on theIBD 50 listof stocks with strong relative price strength and   fundamentals.Tuesday was the stock's ex-dividend date, meaning that you had   to own shares before that to be eligible for its dividend. Its   dividend yield Monday was 0.6%.A negative: EPS growth has decelerated for two quarters, from   315% to 152% and 11%. Analysts see EPS falling 9% in the current   quarter and 11% this year, and then rising 21% in 2018, in line   with its three-year growth rate.Financials were just the fund's sixth-largest sector, with a   modest 4% weighting. One of those wasCitizens Financial(CFG), a top new buy whose EPS growth has accelerated for three   quarters in a row.Still, the stock is down 3% this year after tumbling 13%   off its March 1 high. That pullback along with the broad market   reflects investors' concerns that Congress' failure to revise or   kill ObamaCare is a sign that additional Trump initiatives, such   as corporate and individual tax cuts and lighter regulatory   burdens for banks, may not be as likely as investors had   hoped.Shares ofCitrix Systems(CTXS), yet another newcomer to the portfolio, surged March 13 on   rumors of a company sale. The company's business   software creates work spaces that provide access to   desktops, apps, data and communications on any device, over   networks and in the cloud.As IBD recently reported,Citrix has been pressured by activist   investor Elliott Management to make changes. On Feb. 1, Citrix completed its spinoff of its GoToMeeting   business, which then merged withLogMeIn(LOGM).GoToMeeting is a conferencing application that allows remote   access to personal computers.Citrix shares are up 20% this year. The cloud computing   company's most recent EPS report was for Q4, in January.   It earned $1.61 a share on sales of $908 million. That   topped consensus for EPS of $1.50 and revenue of $900.8 million.   But the $1.61 was a decline of 3%.The company forecast 2017 EPS of $4.60-$4.65 and revenue of   $2.81 billion to $2.84 billion. Both are well below consensus for   $5.60 EPS and sales of $3.55 billion, but Citrix's guidance   excludes GoToMeeting.VMware(VMW) is another new buy for the fund. The server virtualization   leader is up 17% this year. EPS grew 0%, 4%, 12% and 13% the past   four quarters.VMware paid $1.3 billion to buy Niciria, a software-defined   networking company, three years ago. VMware said recently it   expects $1 billion in sales of NSX, made possible by that   acquisition. NSX lets companies update networks through software   changes rather than the more costly path of replacing routers and   switching hardware.NSX is a challenge toCisco Systems'(CSCO) flagship networking software product, called Application   Centric Infrastructure (ACI).In the consumer discretionary sector, bellwetherAmazon(AMZN) and auto-parts chainO'Reilly Automotive(ORLY) were the fund's second- and seventh-largest holdings as of   Jan. 31.Amazon has been trending mostly sideways since mid-February,   hanging on to a 17% gain so far this year.O'Reilly is down 1% this year.RELATED:IBD's Best Mutual Funds 2017 Awards: New Crop     Of WinnersFacebook, Alphabet Among Hot Tech Stocks     American Century Growth Mutual Fund Likes"

Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock Is a Rotten Apple;3/31/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWithout a doubt, if ever there was a candidate for a ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"" stock, it would beAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD).makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockNot long ago, on a CNBC roundtable segment, an analyst proposed a ""buy"" recommendation on AMD stock. The other pundits laughed. And then they laughed some more. When the humor appeared to fade, they laughed again, just for good measure.It took a while, but the joke was ultimately on the naysayers. Last year was a stunning turnaround for Advanced Micro Devices. From start to finish, AMD stock returned long-suffering shareholders more than 300% in profits.To put that into perspective, 2016 was the biggest year in its publicly traded existence. More impressively, AMD eclipsed the performance of 2009, when several stocks were clawing back from 2008's devastation.What's particularly endearing for both present stakeholders and prospective buyers is that Advanced Micro Devices is not slowing down. For 2017, AMD stock is up just shy of 30%. That's enough for a very solid year for most people's portfolios.In fact, if it keeps up this work rate, AMD could challenge for yet another triple-digit return. That would make consecutive triple-digit returns, something that hasn't happened for AMD stock since 1982 and 1983.Although the prospect for a history-making event is extremely enticing for investors, we also have to remember the risks. Advanced Micro Devices has long played second-fiddle toIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) for a reason. It also gave a foothold for semiconductor rivals likeNvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA).The question is, which AMD will show up this time around?Many Reasons to Love AMD StockCertainly, I can respect the idea of Advanced Micro Devices pulling off another upset.It's running high on momentum, and sometimes, that's all you really need.But as InvestorPlace writer Tom Taulli asserts, other substantive factors are working in favor of AMD stock.The 7 Best Stocks to Buy for an Income-Rich RetirementHaving a strong business is all about people. And AMD has apowerhouse leadership, starting from the top. At the helm is CEO Lisa Su, a phenomenal executive who has a doctorate's degree in electrical engineering from MIT. She has also served in high-level positions at renowned firmsFreescale Semiconductor Ltd(NYSE:FSL) andInternational Business Machines Corp. (NYSE:IBM).Along with great people are products. Historically, this is one area that has tripped up AMD stock. Although, it's always been cheaper in price compared to rival Intel's offerings, AMD semiconductors have wrestled with the quality stigma.The company hopes to change that with itsRyzen CPUseries. Imbued with the latest technological firepower, it can legitimately challenge Intel for the throne. True to its heritage, the AMD units are priced lower than the competition. As Su succinctly states, ""More performance, half the price.""Finally, the broader fundamentals are supportive of AMD stock. The supply glut that gutted the semiconductor industry is easing, facilitating recoveries of left-for-dead tech firms.Don't Look Under the Hood!As great as the bullish argument for AMD stock is, I still have my doubts. No one doubts the abilities of Advanced Micro Devices' CEO, but Su is a genius, not a miracle worker. In this case, the problem is bigger than her or anyone else.Last time around, I mentioned that AMD stock has shifted from onestate of distressto another. This assessment was based on the venerable Altman Z-Score indicator. And although it's improving in this department, AMD has been distressed for the past six consecutive years.But the fine print is in which specific factors AMD is improving, and not improving. TheZ-Scoreis aggregated from a list of five factors. By far, the largest improvement is in the ratio between ""market value of equity"" and ""book value of total liabilities."" Although important, this doesn't tell us much about company performance.What's Driving the Increase in Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock?What does illuminate performance are the Z-Score's earnings and sales generation factors. For both metrics, AMD stock is still considered distressed. That likely won't change until the semiconductor firm can address the deep-seated problems that got it in trouble initially.As a small caveat, I do think that the recovery in AMD stock is nothing short of remarkable. It might have some legs to go a little bit further. But to stake a major position on the back of exceptionally poor fundamentals? I'm crazy, but I'm notthatcrazy.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace4 Tech Stocks That Are Breaking Out (Or Will Soon)10 Stocks You'd Be Foolish to Buy Right NowMicrosoft Corporation (MSFT) Will Sell You a Galaxy S8The postAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc.

Oculus Rift Co-Founder Palmer Luckey Resigns from Facebook;3/31/2017;"Per Bloomberg, which quotedFacebook Inc.FB, Oculus Rift co-founder Palmer Luckey has left the social media company. Notably, Facebook acquired Oculus for $2 billion in 2014.makeArticleAd();Palmer Luckey's departure was due to a controversy during the U.S. presidential election in 2016. We note that he remained mostly aloof from the media since reports surfaced that he was financing a group that created anti-Hillary Clinton memes for the web.Per Bloomberg, Facebook also distanced itself from Luckey on this issue. He also apologized via a Facebook post on Sep 23, 2016 and did not attend the company's Oculus Connect conference to avoid ""distractions"".Moreover, in Jan 2017, Luckey testified in a lawsuit filed against Facebook by ZeniMax Media, which claimed Oculus ""stole"" its intellectual property to boost its own Virtual Reality (VR) research. Per Bloomberg, Facebook lost the lawsuit, with the jury awarding $500 million to ZeniMax Media.We believe that Luckey's departure will not have any major impact on the operations of Oculus, which recently (Dec 2016) split into two units. This was also evident from the share price movement. Shares declined a negligible 0.17% to close at $142.41 on Mar 30.We note that Facebook has outperformed the ZacksInternet Servicesindustry on a year-to-date basis. While the stock returned 22.4%, the industry gained 8.9% over the same time frame.Oculus - Growth Catalyst for FacebookAccording to research firm Superdata, the global VR market is estimated to be worth almost $38 billion within the next three years, twenty times of $1.8 billion in 2016. In 2017, the market is expected to grow to almost $5 billion, up 168% over 2016.Further, per a recent IDC report, global revenues of the Augmented Reality (AR) /VR market are expected to grow at a CAGR of 181.3% from $5.2 billion in 2016 to over $162 billion in 2020.Though in its infancy, AR and VR technologies along with artificial intelligence are considered the next big business opportunities in the technology space, which is also evident from the aforesaid projections.Consequently, all the tech giants right from Facebook to MicrosoftMSFT, AmazonAMZNand AlphabetGOOGLare pumping huge resources to develop the new technology.We believe that Oculus is well positioned to tap this huge growth opportunity based on its expanding product portfolio, which now includes Rift as well as Motion Controllers (launched in Dec 2016). The company continues to invest in developing the product line and announced another $250 million investment to develop VR content ecosystem in Oct.2016.Facebook, Inc. Revenue (TTM)Facebook, Inc. Revenue (TTM)|Facebook, Inc. QuoteMoreover, the acquisition of Denmark-based startup, The Eye Tribe, will also boost product capabilities going forward. (Read More:Facebook Boosts VR Efforts with Eye Tribe Acquisition)ConclusionOculus has long been dubbed as a big growth driver along with Facebook's other product platforms like Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp.  However, the technology is yet to live up to expectations that are far higher than its other platforms.

AT&T Inc. (T) Stock Wins Contract to Build Network for First Responders;3/31/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIf you're anAT&T Inc.(NYSE:T) stakeholder of any stripe, you're either about to see your wallet get fatter and/or your connection get faster.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockWhile you might not have noticed by the less-than-rousing 60-basis-point gain, AT&T scored a decisive victory Thursday - the FirstNet contract, a 700 MHz LTE network to be used exclusively by our nation's first responders.The company plans to spend $40 billion (not including the $7 billion federal grant) over the life of the contract - 25 years - and will commercialize the spectrum along with four partners:Motorola Solutions Inc(NYSE:MSI), Sapient Corp,General Dynamics Corporation(NYSE:GD) andInmarsat Plc, London.Bernstein analysts including Pierre Ferragu see this as mostly bullish for all involved.Here's why:What Is FirstNet?FirstNet was first proposed after Sept. 11, 2001, as a national wireless broadband network for police, firefighters and all first responders of the United States. As Commerce Secretary Wilbur Rossput it, it ""will change an untenable status quo by providing first responders with the tools they need to keep us safe"" and serves as a ""prime example"" of the power of partnerships between the government and the private sector.10 Stocks You'd Be Foolish to Buy Right NowWhen implemented, FirstNet would free first responders from the tangles of everyday network congestion, which is widely thought to have contributed to the chaos on the ground among rescuers during the Sept. 11 attacks. AT&T CEO and Board Chair Randall Stephenson has said that ""our first responders … deserve the very best technology"" and it's up to his company and ragtag assortment of telecoms to get it there.While initially recommended in 2004, the legislation that got FirstNet off the ground began in 2012, and it allows states the option to build their own networks. To work properly, FirstNet would need state participation … and states can choose to opt out. And as theWall Street Journalwrites, a""politically connected startup"" that lost out on the contract in favor of AT&T is lobbying to coerce states to do just that.Still, the buildout of such an initiative is expected to create10,000 jobsover two years. This huge investment in the communications infrastructure in the U.S. will, in theory, aid 320 million people. It's a chintzy feather in the Donald Trump administration's cap, and something we're likely to see President Trump himself trotting around the media.But what's in it for AT&T Inc. and T stock holders?What AT&T Gets Out of ItIn its fully functional form, FirstNet seeks to be self-funded by subscription fees from the first responders themselves, and subsidized through the sale of leftover spectrum by T to private companies. And AT&T gets some huge pieces of spectrum toplay around with, including $6.5 billion toward its construction (awarded out as milestone-payments over five years).It's a blow toVerizon Communications Inc.(NYSE:VZ), as AT&T will have 25 MHz of spectrum allowed for use within its own commercial network, yielding speedier connections for the telecom's customers and a solid marketing pitch to boot. That goes a long way toward attracting fresh blood to the T stock ecosystem.Further, AT&T will be able to connect FirstNet users with its own network assets,a value of $180 billion.AT&T's networkshould also provide""near real-time information on traffic conditions to determine the fastest route to an emergency,"" and will facilitate the use of wearables and drones to capture high-quality, real-time images of emergencies, such as fires or floods. That could potentially widen the revenue streams for the telecom's own wearables.So if this is such good news for T stock holders then why did T stock react like a fish flopping around a wooden deck? Because it was already ""widely anticipated,"" as Bernstein put it. It's not, however, a certainty that the FirstNet rollout goes over smoothly.Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Will Sell You a Galaxy S8Still, it's a solid victory for AT&T, and doubly so for the much-smaller MSI, which Bernstein sees as reaping the most reward:""… this is positive news for our space - Important questions are still pending about the magnitude of the upside, its timing and how it will flow through to our three companies. At this stage we see MSI as the most positively impacted, closely followed byEricsson(NASDAQ:ERIC) and thenNokia Corp (ADR)(NYSE:NOK) as a likely third beneficiary, although by a less certain and lower magnitude.""T stock is up 17 basis points Friday morning, but still down 1.5% for the year. That said, you could do a lot worse than this telecom right now.As of this writing, John Kilhefner did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceThe 7 Best Stocks to Buy for an Income-Rich Retirement10 Small-Cap Stocks That Could Double in the Next 3 MonthsWhy Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Stock Is Downright DangerousThe postAT&T Inc.

Dividend Smackdown: IBM Stock vs MSFT Stock;3/31/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsRing the bell because it's that time again. We're putting two iconic dividend payers in the ring for an old-school dividend smackdown. The fighters: Two old-school tech giants,Microsoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) andInternational Business Machines Corp.(NYSE:IBM).makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockAt first this might seem like a bout between two washed up has-beens. Both of these companies are ancient by tech company standards, and neither gets the headlines they used to. Yet longevity in the tech space is something to take seriously. If you're able to survive decades in an industry known for rapid upheaval, you're clearly doing something right.Yet no fighter's streak lasts forever. Even Mike Tyson eventually got knocked out, by underdog Buster Douglas. And in our match today, one company is well into a bona fide comeback, whereas the other is at risk of getting knocked out … permanently.So with that, let's go ringside in this battle between IBM stock and MSFT stock starting with the current dividend yield.Dividend YieldIn a world where theS&P 500yields just 1.9%, both Microsoft and IBM have to be considered relatively high-yield stocks. Microsoft stock sports a dividend yield of 2.4% and IBM 3.2%. So, in a head-to-head match up, IBM is clearly the higher yielder.The 7 Best Stocks to Buy for an Income-Rich RetirementFurthermore, at first glance, IBM's dividend would appear to be more sustainable. IBM stock is only paying out 44% of current earnings per share, whereas MSFT is payout out a much higher 69%.So, in round one of this dividend smackdown, we have a clear winner: Big Blue.Dividend Yield Winner:IBMDividend GrowthFor round two, let's take a look at dividend growth. After all, the current dividend yield only gets you so far, as a dividend stock without a growing dividend is essentially just a riskier version of a bond. A good dividend stock should have both a respectable current yield and a dividend growth rate well in excess of inflation.Click to EnlargeWell, both of our fighters qualify here. Microsoft has raised its dividend for 13 consecutive years, and IBM has raised its dividend for 17.Over the past 10 years, both stocks have been aggressive dividend raisers, but one has clearly taken the lead. Microsoft has raised its payout by a cumulative 300%, which would crush nearly any competitor other than IBM. Big Blue has managed to raise its dividend a cumulative 400%.Over the past five years, MSFT stock has the edge, beating out IBM stock by a cumulative 125% to 87%. But in round two, I'm going to have to give the edge to IBM.Dividend Growth Winner:IBMFuture ProspectsThus far, it has been a lopsided contest, with IBM taking the first two rounds. So is the match over? Or is Microsoft about to mount a comeback worthy of Rocky Balboa?Let's take a look.Both companies are undergoing transformations of sorts.With sales of personal computers in a multi-year slump, Microsoft is eager to move past the PC era to become a ""cloud and services"" company. Likewise, IBM is transitioning away from its traditional business of selling hardware with long-term service contracts to companies and is instead focusing on growth in cloud services and analytics. Interestingly, this means that these two companies - which have mostly operated in different  realms in their respective histories - are now increasingly direct competitors.The transition to the cloud has been disruptive to both companies, but it's been particularly brutal for IBM. IBM has seen its revenues drop for19 consecutive quarters. That's just shy of five complete years of falling year-over-year sales. At this point, you would expect to see sales grow, if only because the comparable sales from the previous year were so horrendously bad. Yet IBM's sales continue to sag.4 Things Every Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Owner Should Worry AboutSo, if revenues are falling … where is IBM getting the cash to fund its dividend?Unfortunately, by borrowing it. IBM's long-term debt is up by 50% since 2011. It's also aggressively repurchasing shares, and every share that is buys back is a share for which it doesn't have to pay a dividend. While that works as a short-term solution, it's hardly a long-term plan. So unless sales recover in a hurry, IBM stock is going to be on the ropes.Microsoft has had some revenue issues of its own, as lack of PC sales growth has affected licensing revenues from Windows and Office. But Microsoft's cloud business has been unstopable, and Microsoft is now considered by many to be second only toAmazon.com, Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS as a cloud services provider.Future Prospects Winner:MSFTBottom Line: MSFT Stock WinsMicrosoft comes from behind and delivers a devastating blow to IBM, winning the final round … and the match.IBM looks better on paper, with a higher dividend yield and higher dividend growth over the past 10 years. But IBM's business is suffering, whereas Microsoft has already essentially done the hard work of reinventing itself.Charles Sizemore is the principal ofSizemore Capital, a wealth management firm in Dallas, Texas.More From InvestorPlaceThe 7 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for the Second Quarter7 Dividend Stocks With Yields That Grow Like Weeds10 Safe Dividend Stocks to Own During the Next Market CrashThe postDividend Smackdown: IBM Stock vs MSFT Stockappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Bear of the Day: Gamestop (GME);3/31/2017;"makeZacksArticleAd();Gamestop Corporation(GME) continues to see a decline in same-store sales as sales of physical video games slide. This Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Buy) is closing 150 stores as it tries to cope.GameStop operates more than 7,500 stores across 14 countries as well as several websites, including gamestop.com, and gamer magazines and publications.Its Technology Brands segments includes 1,522 Simply Mac, Spring Mobile AT&T and Cricket stores.Terrible Holiday Quarter ResultsOn Mar 23, GameStop reported its fourth quarter and fiscal 2016 results. It actually beat on the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 9 cents, reporting $2.38 versus the Consensus of $2.29.But that really wasn't the full story.The video game business continued to be weak. Total global sales fell 13.6% to $3.05 billion, while comparable store sales declined 16.3%.They were even worse in the US, as they fell 20.8%, while falling just 4.6% internationally.The quarter was significantly impacted by weak sales of certain AAA titles and aggressive console promotions by other retailers on Black Friday. New hardware sales fell 29.1% and new software sales sank 19.3%.Additionally, consumer tastes are simply changing as more games are being sold digitally versus at the stores.Similarly to what happened to video stores, once you can stream a game or just download it, why would you need to buy the physical game?Eventually, most gaming analysts believe that ALL video games will be sold online.Closing 150 StoresIn response to some of the weakness in the physical games, GameStop announced it was closing 150 stores. But with over 7,500, that's really a drop in the bucket.The company has plans to focus on growth in its Technology Brands division, but this is a really small fraction of overall revenue. In the fourth quarter it was just $256 million.Weak 2017 Guidance Leads to Estimate CutsGameStop announced that it would no longer give quarterly EPS or same-store sales guidance, saying it wants to focus on longer-term guidance like full year results.It provided a 2017 outlook which gave a range for total sales of a decline of 2% to a gain of 2%.GameStop also sees comparable store sales still weak, giving a range of -5% to 0.0%.Earnings are seen in the range of $3.10 to $3.40, which was under consensus. As a result, the analysts have been cutting 2017 estimates.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2017 has sunk to $3.25 from $3.90 in the last 90 days. That's an earnings decline of 13.7% as the company earned $3.77 last year.Shares SinkNot surprisingly, shares have sunk to nearly 3 year lows.They are, actually, cheap, with a forward P/E of just 6.7.But the video game industry is changing. It's always risky for investors to be in industries with technology disruptions.If you want to invest in gaming, you may want to considerBest Buy(BBY) or evenMicrosoft(MSFT), instead.

Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Will Sell You a Galaxy S8;3/31/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe big news this week was theSamsung Electronics Co Ltd(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) special event where theGalaxy S8 was finally launched.Microsoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) would like to sell you one.makeArticleAd();Source: SamsungNo, not a Windows smartphone - although it still has a few of those gathering dust in its stores. Instead the company appears to be making the most of a bad situation by offering aMicrosoft Edition Galaxy S8in its stores.These versions of the Galaxy S8 will get loaded up with MSFT apps so that even if they aren't running Windows, they're at least being used with Microsoft services.Windows Smartphone Ambitions Are in TroubleMicrosoft had grand plans for Windows smartphones. It bought the smartphone business fromNokia Corp (ADR)(NYSE:NOK) and released Windows 10 Mobile, an ambitious operating system that brought much of the desktop Windows experience to smartphones. Neither of those moves have paid off, though. The company eventually took a$7.6 billion write-offand laid off 7,800 phone business workers because of the Nokia venture.10 Stocks You'd Be Foolish to Buy Right NowMSFT has done little to convince consumers to buy a Windows smartphone, not bothering to compete against Samsung orApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) on hardware. And Windows 10 Mobile has failed to capture its own die-hard audience as Apple and Google have with iOS and Android, respectively.At this point,Windows has dropped to a 0.3% shareof the smartphone market, with MSFT selling just over one million Windows smartphones in Q4 2016 - down from about 4.4 million the year before.Earlier this week, even as Samsung wasannouncing the Galaxy S8,Verizon Communications Inc.(NYSE:VZ)pulled the Lumia 735off store shelves. This means the carrier no longer offers any Windows smartphone options.Is the Microsoft Edition Galaxy S8 a Solution?Microsoft has been pushing the importance of services, and having its solutions available everywhere - whether that's Office on an iPad or Skype on an Android smartphone.When Samsung announced the Galaxy S8, MSFT was there the next day promoting a customized Microsoft Edition Galaxy S8. Quoted inThe Verge, a Microsoft spokesperson explained what this is, exactly:""A Microsoft customization is applied to the Samsung Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ Microsoft Edition when the devices are unboxed and connected to Wi-Fi. This customization ensures customers a best-in-class productivity experience with Microsoft applications such as Office, OneDrive, Cortana, Outlook and more.""Confusing the situation slightly is the fact thatallGalaxy S8 phones will come bundled with basic Microsoft apps - Samsung and Microsoft have been doing that since the Galaxy S6. The Microsoft Edition Galaxy S8 is available for pre-order, but only at Microsoft stores. Not online. And the cost will be the regular retail price for the Galaxy S8.So no special paint job or visual difference compared to a regular Galaxy S8, no price discount and just a few additional apps that anyone can download to the Galaxy S8 on their own if they choose to do so. And you end up with three virtual assistants competing for your attention: Android's Google Assistant, Samsung's Bixby and Microsoft's Cortana.Bottom Line on the Microsoft Edition Galaxy S8Why Bother?The move will get those Microsoft apps in a prominent position on a few more Android smartphones. That's a few more people who are less likely to use alternatives fromAlphabet Inc's(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google.What's Driving the Increase in Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock?Microsoft managed to get a few eyeballs looking its way as part of the Galaxy S8 launch frenzy. And if there are lineups for the Galaxy S8 when it goes on sale in stores, some people might skip the wait at the carriers and duck into a Microsoft store to grab a Microsoft Edition Galaxy S8 instead.Or, it could be a delaying tactic, making it look like MSFT is doingsomethingon the mobile front while it lines up the ducks on theSurface Phone its rumored to be working on.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace4 Tech Stocks That Are Breaking Out (Or Will Soon)3 Reasons Amazon.com, Inc.

Equinix (EQIX) Enters into Strategic Alliance with Verizon;3/31/2017;"Global data center service provider,Equinix Inc.EQIXand U.S. telecom giant Verizon CommunicationsVZinked a deal, wherein the latter will resell Equinix colocation and interconnection services worldwide.Per the agreement, Verizon will pair its security, network and advanced communications services with Equinix's colocation facility to meet the fast-growing demand for security, build hybrid cloud solutions and data services globally.The deal is likely to strengthen Equinix's relationship with Verizon and boost its growth trajectory.Following the announcement, shares of Equinix touched a new 52-week high of $398 on Mar 30, before closing the day at $394.14.Equinix's ProfitEquinix is a global interconnection and data center company and a major colocation facility provider. The company provides space, power and cooling facilities to customers. Growing implementation of cloud computing technology has increased demand for data center space. Amazon Web Services, the cloud computing business of Amazon.com Inc.AMZNand Microsoft Corp.MSFTare major clients of Equinix.Naturally, the deal will enable Equinix to help enterprise customers to reap benefits from its cloud infrastructure, including a secure connection, outstanding scalability and infrastructure dependability.According to Jon Lin, vice president of corporate development and strategy for Equinix,""Through this agreement, our mutual enterprise customers gain the global scale and interconnection capabilities of Platform Equinix together with Verizon's global IP network, managed security services and advanced communications services.""Also, the deal will enable Equinix's customers to gauge the performance of application-based platforms from secure International Business Exchange (IBX) data centers. This in turn will enhance user satisfaction and help Equinix to expand its customer base and market share.Equinix-VerizonThe two companies entered into a definitive agreement on Dec 6, 2016, wherein,Equinix agreed to acquire Verizon's 24 data center sites, comprising 29 data center buildings across 15 metro areas for a total cash consideration of $3.6 billion. The deal is likely to close by mid-2017.Bottom LineExpansion in important markets and consolidation of facilities in existing ones have been crucial to Equinix's core strategy. The company consistently strives to boost its revenue base and profitability by offering upgraded technology to clients. Moreover, the recurring revenue model has been providing the much-needed support to Equinix's revenue stream over the years. The company's cloud and IT service businesses are its fastest growing segments and account for roughly one fourth of the total revenue.Further, Equinix remains positive on the growing demand for data centers. In order to meet the rising demand for cloud services, this interconnection and data center company is expanding its IBX data centers globally, and gaining popularity among tech companies looking for data management. Thus, the company expects its total addressable market for retail data centers to increase at a CAGR of 8% between 2013 and 2017 and reach $24 billion. Based on this, Equinix projects revenue growth rate of 10% through 2017.Therefore, we believe that this deal will help the company in strengthening its global footprint and bring in additional revenues.Shares of Equinix have been steadily treading higher on a year-to-date basis. The stock returned approximately 11.1% compared with the ZacksREIT-Equity Trustindustry's decline of 4%.However, intensifying competition from established Internet data center operators may affect product pricing, thereby denting Equinix's margins.

Is Amazon Following Microsoft's Lead in Augmented Reality?;3/31/2017;"Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) could be developing augmented reality (or AR)   features for its own chain of homewares stores, according toThe New York Times. The report, which cites a source ""briefed in the discussions,""   indicates that shoppers at Amazon's brick-and-mortar homewares   stores could use devices or apps to ""project"" home furnishings   into digital images of their actual living rooms.This idea isn't really new. Back in 2013,IKEAlaunched an  AR app which let customers project furniture   into their living rooms via a smartphone camera. Last year, home   improvement retailerLowe's(NYSE: LOW) installedMicrosoft's(NASDAQ: MSFT) HoloLens mixed reality headset at  select   stores to let shoppers design virtual rooms.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();However, Amazon's AR plans coincide with its recent moves into   the brick-and-mortar space with test bookstores, grocery stores,   and now rumored homewares stores. Let's see what that push means   for Amazon, and how it could boost demand for Microsoft's   HoloLens and holographic apps.What is Amazon up to?Amazon's brick-and-mortar expansion might seem   counterproductive, since its online marketplace is forcing many   brick-and-mortar retailers to shutter stores and invest more   heavily in e-commerce. However,Wal-Mart(NYSE: WMT) has proven that some customers still prefer placing   orders online and picking them up immediately to avoid wait times   and shipping fees.To cut overhead costs, Amazon's grocery store model uses    a ""just walk out"" system called Amazon Go. The store tracks   the items taken by the customer and charges their Amazon accounts   once they walk out -- eliminating the need for checkout lines and   cashiers. Its bookstores offer special discounts to Prime   members, and offers self-checkout via  the Amazon app.For the rumored homewares push, the idea will likely be the   same -- to offer self-checkout for smaller items, delivery for   larger items, and discounts for Prime members. Assuming that you   have pictures of your living room, you can potentially project   the home furnishings into your home like the IKEA app.Since these brick-and-mortar stores all give preferential   treatment to Prime members, that expansion can boost the growth   of the Prime ecosystem. Last June, research firm CIRP estimated   that  Amazon had 63 million Prime members in the U.S., a 19   million increase from a year earlier. It also estimated that the   average Prime member spent $1,200 annually at Amazon, while   non-members spent just $500.Making sense of Amazon's AR investmentsThis isn't Amazon's first move into the AR market. However,   its previous moves have been all over the map. In late 2015, it   patented an AR projection system, similar to  Microsoft's   IllumiRoom, which ""transformed"" living rooms into completely   different, interactive environments. For example, a user could   theoretically tap the wall and turn it into a TV screen, or tap   the desk to open an e-book.Last year, Amazon offered jobs for a virtual reality team. It   didn't say  much about the team's goals, except that it   would focus on a platform for ""immersive storytelling"". Analysts   and investors speculated that Amazon could apply VR to games on   the Fire TV, or add VR viewing options to Amazon Video. However,   the recent report about AR homewares indicates that the team   might actually be developing new AR features for the Amazon app   to enhance the shopping experience at its brick-and-mortar   stores.What does this mean for Microsoft and the AR     market?Amazon's rumored AR app or homewares stores might never see   the light of day, since the company hasn't publicly said anything   about them yet. But Amazon's interest might get other retailers   interested in using AR tools in brick-and-mortar stores.A HoloLens demo at Lowe's. Image source: Lowe's.That would be great news for Microsoft, since the HoloLens is   the most mature ""mixed reality"" headset today. The upcoming   Windows 10 Creators Update, which will add easy-to-use   holographic tools for developers, could also  make it much   easier for retailers to build custom apps for the HoloLens   without Microsoft's help. This wouldn't only apply to big box   retailers like Lowe's --Volvois also using the HoloLens in dealerships to let customers   virtually view cars which aren't in stock.Is augmented reality the next big thing?It's hard to tell if Amazon and Microsoft's early AR moves   into the retail space will ignite a major shift in how stores   showcase their products. However, tech M&A advisory firm   Digi-Capital estimates that  the AR market will grow from   nearly nothing today to $90 billion by 2020, with much of that   growth generated by sales of AR hardware, e-commerce uses, and   enterprise applications.If companies like Amazon and Microsoft lead this charge, we   could see mainstream interest in AR evolve beyond early efforts   like Google Glass andPokemon Gotoward shopping apps. That shift could blur the lines between   ""showrooming"" and online purchases, which could help tech giants   like Amazon straddle both markets.10 stocks we like better than MicrosoftWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

What's Behind Computer Sciences' (CSC) Recent Momentum?;3/31/2017;"Computer Sciences CorporationCSChas gained solid momentum recently, with shares gaining over 4.5% in the last three trading days. The recent momentum came after the company, on Mar 27, announced that majority of its shareholders have approved its merger with Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company'sHPEEnterprise Services business. CSC expects to complete the merger before Apr 3.Notably, in May 2016, CSC announced its decision to merge the company's business with HPE's Enterprise Services business, which will be spun off from the parent company. This deal will bring CSC's strengths in insurance, healthcare and financial services together with HPE's Enterprise Services expertise in industries like transportation, pharma, technology, media and telecom.Post merger, the combined entity will become the world's second-largest IT services company after Accenture plcACNand generate revenues of approximately $26 billion. Per the deal, shareholders of each of the companies will own about 50% of the combined company.Over the past few years, Computer Sciences has been focused on cloud computing and the Big Data business to cash in on the growing demand. Companies are increasingly relying on cloud-based services to make IT systems more agile and productive, and save costs considerably.We believe that the merger with HPE's business will strengthen Computer Sciences' capabilities, enabling it to become a leading player in the IT services domain.Apart from the aforementioned announcement, CSC's inclusion in the S&P 500 list also contributed to the recent momentum. The company will replace Southwestern Energy (SWN) and take its place in the S&P 500 list on Apr 4.CSC's stock price history reveals that the company hasn't disappointed in a long time. In fact, over the past one year, shares of Computer Sciences rallied 107.6%, outperforming the Zacks categorizedComputer-Servicesindustry, which gained merely 17.1%.We are optimistic about the company's traction in cloud and partnerships with HCL, AT&T, VMware and MicrosoftMSFT, which are expected to drive growth over the long run.Further, CSC's strategic acquisitions are likely to enhance its portfolio and drive growth. Some of the most important acquisitions made by Computer Sciences include UCX Limited, Autonomic Resources, Fruition Partners and Fixnetix.However, the company is likely to face some challenges with regard to the integration of the new businesses and the costs associated with them. Apart from this, increased competition, delay in government's order renewal process and constricted federal spending are the other concerns.Currently, Computer Sciences has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

"Close Update: Wall Street Buoyed by Upbeat GDP; WTI Tops $50/Barrel";3/30/2017;"Wall Street closed higher with energy and banking sectors outperforming when a better-than-expected upward revision to fourth quarter GDP raised investors' confidence in equity assets and increased the odds for the Fed to tighten at least twice more in 2017.

Are New Consoles From Sony and Microsoft on the Horizon?;3/30/2017;"Since the release of the Playstation 4 and Xbox One in 2013,     video gamers are already thinking about the next generation of     major consoles.In this segment fromIndustry Focus: Consumer Goods, the team discusses when the world may finally see theSony(NYSE: SNE) Playstation 5 orMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Xbox 2, if at all. As it turns out, new     technology may completely change the way these companies     approach their business models.A full transcript follows the video.makeArticleAd();10 stocks we like better than SonyWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock         tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they         have run for over a decade,Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has tripled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy right now... and Sony wasn't one of         them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even         better buys.Click hereto learn about these picks!*Stock Advisor returns as of February 6, 2017This video was recorded on March 23, 2017.Vincent Shen:Moving on to the next big console player, this     is Sony. The PlayStation 4 Pro is already     available to gamers. While the PlayStation VR introduced a bit     of that technology to the platform, I think the Pro ultimately     adds some beefier specs, and it also enables some 4K     capabilities, right? The next step for Sony that a     lot of people are wondering about is based on historical     intervals between generations, we touched on this, the     PlayStation 5, potentially on store shelves by 2019. I thought     it was really interesting, an analyst atMacquarieResearch actually believes that the release     date might be even sooner, and this has to do with     competition from Microsoft, who we will talk about     soon.For Sony, just to give you a little bit of perspective     in term of how the PlayStation business folds into their     overall company, the Game and Network Services segment, which     includes the PlayStation business, $5.3 billion reported most     recently. That's about one quarter of total sales. That     potential PlayStation 5 -- which is not confirmed, by the     way. This is just rumors and speculation. But, if it     does come out earlier if, they believe it will be because     of Project Scorpio, which is the project name at     Microsoft. Can you tell us a little bit about that?Seth McNew:Yeah. We're still waiting to learn more about what Project     Scorpio actually is. Is it an Xbox 2? Or a next generation?     We already had the Xbox One S. So we'll see what that     looks like. But, similar, we're seeing it's going to have     the 4K gaming and the VR, certainly, Microsoft and Oculus     announcing their partnership. We'll see what the     technology looks like that really sets it apart.Shen:Yeah. The release date is expected potentially later this     year in 2017. I didn't realize it was going to be coming     up that soon. Poised, of course, for the holiday shopping     season, always important for these guys. In the latest     quarter, again, for Microsoft, it's a little tougher, because     it's such a big business, and obviously, you're thinking about     all these other opportunities they have, their classic OS.     But, Microsoft reported gaming revenue of about $3.5     billion, total top line of $24 billion for its latest quarter.     Again, it's smaller, but it's not a trivial part of     the business, either. Ultimately, if you're looking for     something in terms of exposure for gaming, I typically think,     and I think a lot of investors, typically think of those major     names we talked aboutActivisionandElectronic ArtsandTake-Two Interactive. But it's definitely an interesting approach that they have.     They have flexibility, too.McNew:Yeah. You wonder if this is similar to companies likeApplewith the iPhone, how long can they just keep going to the     next console, and are they putting them out because     there's new technology to support a new release, or just     because they're trying to break into that cycle of having     a new one every couple years. So, hopefully, these new     ones that come out, there really is some game-changing     technology.Shen:And the thing that's really starting to change     is, traditionally, the PlayStation 3 or PlayStation     4 comes out, it might be backwards compatible, but     you can't use your PlayStation 2 or 3 to play games     released specifically for the 4th generation. Things like that     are starting to get warped. You hear some of the     management from these companies talk about how that kind     of paradigm is changing because of digital downloads. It     can change capabilities, and change what a game release means,     the idea that you don't leave any of your previous players     behind by releasing a title, and it can be played across     all these different consoles.Teresa Kersten is an employee of LinkedIn and is a member     of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

Why Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Is Still a Value Play;3/30/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsGotham Asset Management co-founder Joel Greenblatt certainly thinksApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) provides good value for buyers of AAPL stock.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockIn a recentinterview, Greenblatt talked about how expensive the markets are at the present moment:""When we think about the S&P 500, we go back over the last 26 years where we have good data and look at the entire market from a perspective of bottom's up valuation. Right now the S&P 500 is in roughly the 17th percentile of expensive during those 26 years, meaning it's been cheaper 83% of the time.""To beat the index Greenblatt buys the cheapestS&P 500stocks and shorts the most expensive. And wouldn't you know it, but AAPL stock is one of his largest holdings -31stout of925positions in a $7.8 billion portfolio - at 337,952 shares as of December 31, 2016.For Greenblatt, it's all about cash flow and the price you pay for it:""We've owned Apple for a long time … They generate lots of cash flow, and we don't have to pay a big price for it. That's what's attracted recent investors like Warren Buffett, where he's looking at both that mix between growth and value … We figure out what a business is worth and try to pay a lot less.""Is AAPL Stock a Value Stock?He believes the markets are still valuing AAPL stock as a hardware company when in fact it's very much a service business with iTunes, App Store, Apple Music, etc. CNBC Mad Money host Jim Cramer also feels Apple's service business is underappreciated by investors, thoughts I shared with readers in early February when Apple was trading around $129; up almost 10% since then.The 7 Best Stocks to Buy for an Income-Rich RetirementInvestorPlace contributor Chris Lau recentlydiscussedhow Apple stock hasn't come close to peaking. I couldn't agree more, which is why I asked the rhetorical question back in February of how AAPL stock got to $200.Apple's service revenue accounted for about 9% of overall sales in Q1 2017, growing 18% year-over-year to $7.2 billion. Annualize that and we're talking about almost $29 billion. That's huge when you consider Piper Jeffrey analyst Gene Munster estimated in 2016 that Apple's gross margins on its service revenues were60%and that operating margins could hit 50% in the coming year.If that's accurate, Apple's operating profits in fiscal 2017 could be as high as $15 billion or $2.86 per share for this small part of its business.In fiscal 2016, Apple had operating income per share of $10.90 ($60.0 billionin operating income divided by 5.5 billion shares outstanding); if it grows by 5% in 2017, to $11.45 per share, the services business would account for 25% of Apple's overall operating profit.Bottom Line on Apple StockUnder this scenario, its iPhone business doesn't have to be a home run in order for its profits to keep growing and that's what drives Apple stock prices higher.Why Buying Valeant Pharmaceuticals Intl Inc (VRX) Stock Isn't NutsHowever, it's one thing to suggest ways that AAPL stock might move higher, but it's another to establish whether its stock is cheap. Free cash flow yield is a good way to determine a stock's relative value.Currently, Apple stock's trailing 12-month free cash flow is $52.5 billion or $9.72 per share; an FCF yield of 6.9% based on its Mar. 27 closing price of $140.88. By comparison,Microsoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) has free cash flow of $3.49 per share for the trailing 12 months or an FCF yield of 5.4% based on its Mar. 27 closing price of $65.10.The possibility of Apple's operating margins moving higher as a result of its growing services revenue combined with talk it's going to hike its dividend payout closer to its large-cap peers to50%from 25% of annual earnings along with expected free cash flow growth of 10% annually in the future suggests AAPL stock might still be a value stock.I believe Joel Greenblatt would agree.As of this writing, Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 Small-Cap Stocks That Could Double in the Next 3 Months10 Clobbered Stocks to Buy That Are About to Get Red-HotThe postWhy Apple Inc.

Avoid Twilio Inc (TWLO) Stock Until $25.70 or Better!;3/30/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsCloud play and recent IPOTwilio Inc(NYSE:TWLO) continues to enjoy Street support, but other issues both off and on the price chart continue to suggest not buying into the bull just yet. Let me explain.makeArticleAd();Source:Web Summit Via FlickrIt has been a couple months since I last wrote aboutTwilio stock. I was what you might call a cautious - or more aptly, an opportunistic - bull for the right price. And during that time, not much has changed.For one, my opinion on TWLO stock still remains the same. If you don't have profits, cash flow and persistently weak stock action trump cutting-edge cloud technology that has captured A-list customers likeAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN),Facebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB),Home Depot Inc(NYSE:HD) and privately held marquee companies such asUberandAirbnb.Why the negativity regarding TWLO stock? Don't I have any vision for TWLO stock's future prospects? Forgive the repeat, but Twilio's narrative continues to look too much likeFireEye Inc(NASDAQ:FEYE).The cyber-security outfit also had Wall Street's blessing with 'strong buy' recommendations, spent aggressively to acquire top-notch companies - and has ultimately continued to bleed financially both off and on the price chart.The 7 Best Stocks to Buy for an Income-Rich RetirementMaybe I'm wrong to read into those similarities as a warning? That's always a possibility, but undeniably and nearly identical is TWLO stock itself. While volatile at times, shares are pretty much smack dab where they were back in mid-January near $28. That's much closer to its all-time-lows of $23.66 than the Street's consensus $38 target and all-time-highs of $70.96TWLO Stock Daily ChartBack in mid-January and after failing to hold a double-bottom pattern above key support, I thought technically, TWLO stock was poised for lower prices sooner, rather than later. It turns out I was wrong and an anticipated test of Twilio's opening and all-time-low of $23.66 has yet to be tested.More to the point, as TWLO stock persists in its weakness in the face of a market which refuses to give up the ghost, FEYE continues to serve as a reminder that skeletons in the closet do exist. As such, if you want to believe Twilio will eventually make a turn for the better, it's time (once again) to consider a credit put spread.TWLO Stock Credit Spread StrategyWhile the TWLO stock price chart didn't fully cooperate with my technical outlook, a below-market put credit spread did just fine last time around. And while I continue to see lower prices for Twilio shares, an out-of-the-money vertical still looks appropriate for investors receptive of buying the name at lower levels.Reviewing the options market with TWLO at $28.25, the April $26/$24 put spread is priced for 30 cents and looks attractive given what has been stated. The seller of this vertical collects the credit as long as shares remain above $26 at expiration.The $2.25 margin of safety from today's $28.25 to the sold $26 strike put amounts to a decline of up to nearly 8% over the next three weeks, with the trader still able to collect the credit. What's more, earnings aren't until early May, so the chances of a larger drop in TWLO stock are obviously reduced.Why Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock Needs an Innovative EdgeBottom line though, if TWLO stock was to decline into the spread or lower and the investor wishes to buy shares, the worst he or she would do is $25.70.And in the event of a crash, the opportunity to purchase stock for no more than $1.70 above whatever the market might determine as fair value, is a nice limited-risk proposition to consider.Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in any of the securities or their derivatives mentioned in this article.

Why Equal Weighted Mutual Funds Scoring Over Index Funds;3/30/2017;"Index funds that invest in different small, mid and large-cap companies in the same proportion are specifically known as equal-weight index funds. Investing in equal-weight funds helps in reducing single stock risk and simultaneously generates attractive returns. Investors interested in maintaining a diversified portfolio might consider investing in equal-weight funds.Not Overly Dependent on Large CapsIndex funds saw strong investments in 2016. According to The Wall Street Journal, index funds attracted a record $400 billion-plus investment last year. However, index funds invest heavily in large-cap companies, following which investors are more susceptible to individual company risk.Also, significant exposure to mid and small-cap issuers might benefit investors of equal-weight mutual funds as these companies have the scope to outperform their large-cap counterparts in the long run. This is mostly because unlike mega-giant and large companies, mid and small caps have enough room to grow in the market. Also, any uncertainty in global markets will affect the behemoths first, while mid and small-cap companies will remain unfazed with more domestic exposure.Mid-cap companies, with market capitalization between $2 billion and $10 billion, have a higher growth potential than the large-cap ones, while small-cap companies, which have market cap of less than $2 billion, offer strong returns.In this respect, investors should look beyond index funds and focus on equal-weight mutual funds as these provide better and diversified market exposure to investors.For example, mutual funds like Vanguard 500 IndexVFINXand Schwab S&P 500 IndexSWPPXinvest in large-cap companies that fall within the range of the S&P 500 Index. The top three holdings of both VFINX and SWPPX are blue-chip companies, Apple IncAAPL, Microsoft CorpMSFTand Exxon Mobil CorpXOM. Given below is the percentage distribution of assets of the two index-based funds in the three Dow components.Fund NameAppleMicrosoftExxon MobilVanguard 500 Index3.57%2.43%1.65%Schwab S&P 500 Index3.17%2.47%1.92%On the other hand, equal-weight fund, Invesco Equally-Weight S&P 500 Fund Class RVADRXinvested all its assets in equal proportions in equity securities of more than 505 companies. Further, as of the last filing, VADRX's top three holdings were NVIDIA CorpNVDA, Allergan PLCAGNand Eli Lilly and CoLLY. The percentage portfolio weight in all the companies ranging from large-cap companies to small-cap entities generally stays near 0.20%. This makes an equal-weight mutual fund a strong investment option because of its ability to diversify its investments in each company equally and offer a strong stock market exposure.Sector Distribution More or Less EvenFor the last one year, equal-weight mutual funds garnered attention after the major equal-weight index outperformed the broader market. The S&P 500 Equal Weight Index returned 16.7% in the last one year, better than the benchmark index S&P 500's one-year annualized return of 16%.An equal-weight fund is a good choice for investors seeking diversification across sectors and companies, and focusing on gaining exposure to stocks that offer high level of returns. Investors with a strong risk appetite should pick these funds. In comparison to capital-weight funds that invest mainly in large-cap companies, equal-weight funds focus more on small and mid-cap companies. While, capital-weight funds invest around 45% of its assets in large-cap companies, equal-weight funds invest only 12% of its assets. This clearly indicates that an equal-weight fund is less dependent on the top 25 companies on the S&P 500 index and has a well-diversified portfolio.Moreover, it can be seen that index fund have invested around 18% of its assets in the tech sector. Also, the top two holdings, Apple and Microsoft, in index funds are from the tech sector. In contrast to this, equal-weight funds have invested in the key S&P 500 sectors, with only 12% of its assets in the tech sector. For example, Vanguard 500 Index invested more than 35% of its assets in the technology and financial services sectors, whereas a major equal-weight fund, Index Funds S&P 500 Equal Weight No Load SharesINDEX, invested its assets in various cyclical, sensitive and defensive sectors. Less exposure in any particular sector helps INDEX to overcome any sudden market uncertainty.Fund NameSectorsVFINXINDEXTechnology19.25%11.84%Financial Services16.46%13.64%Healthcare14.39%12.21%Consumer Cyclical10.84%15.47%Industrials10.49%14.10%Consumer Defensive9.53%8.31%Energy6.63%7.10%Communication Services4.05%1.85%Utilities3.19%5.81%Basic Materials2.89%4.51%Real Estate2.28%5.16%ConclusionEqual-weight mutual funds are the need of the hour. And why not? Unlike index funds that are biased toward large caps and specific sectors, these types of funds minimize their risks by evenly distributing their weight across all caps, including medium and small-sized companies. Such funds also stay invested across all sectors in a more-or-less equal proportion. Needless to say, at a time of heightened uncertainly relating to whether Trump's pro-growth policies will get implemented or not, equal-weight mutual funds have an undue advantage over their peers.Want to learn more about equal weight strategies?

Why Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock Needs an Innovative Edge;3/30/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhile stock inApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) andAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) has been on fire since the start of the year,Microsoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) shares seem becalmed. MSFT stock is up 6%, adding about $25 billion to its market cap, but that gain not only trails its tech rivals, as the NASDAQ average is up 9.56%.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockHow bad is it? It's so bad that Amazon founder Jeff Bezos is threatening to overtake Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates as the world's richest man. He's just $10 billion behind after trade closed Mar 29.This is not down to any complacency on the part of CEO Satya Nadella and his team. If anything, they're moving faster than ever. But Microsoft's days as a monopolist are over. Its products must all earn their way. They're all facing competition in the marketplace. A person or even a company can live without MSFT, and while the company may see this as liberating, some investors are treating it as a reason to worry.MSFT Stock: A Gaming CompetitorFor example, Microsoft investors should be bullish at its efforts in gaming, but there is plenty of competition.Gaming is where developers, and customers, are pushing the envelope on PC performance.

Game delivery is a niche controlled by privately-heldSteam, founded by former Microsoft employees in 1996 and now majority-owned by Gabe Newell.Still, there is ample room for growth in gaming, and Microsoft alone has a position in every important niche.Microsoft Stock's New Hope: AzureNadella made his name at Microsoft building Azure, the company's cloud business. His strategy has been to put all of MSFT's offerings into Azure, to offer its software directly to users through Azure, and to use cloud-based applications to dominate the enterprise market.He can argue that it's working. Microsoft's revenue from Azure-fed businesses, which now includes Office 365, is $14 billion, and Azure should deliver $2.5 billion in hosting revenueall by itself.While Amazon dominates the cloud infrastructure market with a share of over 80%, what investors focus on is the growing competition between Azure andAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), whichsome analysts think Google will win.That would be a disaster for Microsoft stock.Office 365 faces growing competition fromGoogle's G Suite, and that in turn meansgrowing competition for PCs from Google Chromebooks, which are especially gaining share in educationbecause they're cheaper, with more of their functions online.Nothing comes easy anymore.The Bottom Line for MSFT StockAnalysts are generally positive about Microsoft stock, but one-third have it off their buy lists. They expect 69 cents per share of earnings on $22.47 billion in revenue when the company reports April 27, which would represent 10% more revenue and almost 50% more profit than the company delivered in the March quarter last year.Bullish on Snap Inc (SNAP) Stock? Then Answer This QuestionMicrosoft today is the third-largest company in the world, by market cap, at $505 billion. But its operations must race hard to stay in place. Google is ahead, and Amazon is coming up from behind. Technology dominates the stock market, and MSFT stock remains a part of most technology portfolios.Nadella has saved the company. It's no longer at risk to falling off pace likeInternational Business Machines Inc.(NYSE:IBM). Its price-to-earnings ratio of nearly 31 is slightly higher than Google's at 30, and well ahead of Apple's at 17. But there's not one part of Microsoft that can afford to be complacent, and that's a sea change.Dana Blankenhornis a financial and technology journalist.

The 4 Best Dividend Stocks in Cloud Computing;3/29/2017;"Cloud companies often generate high sales growth with thin   margins. They aren't usually associated with dividends, which   generally indicate that a tech company's high growth days are   over.Yet there are still a handful of stocks that expose investors   to the growing cloud market while paying dependable dividends.   Let's take a closer look at four such companies --Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) ,IBM(NYSE: IBM) ,Oracle(NYSE: ORCL) , andHewlett-Packard Enterprise(NYSE: HPE) .Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();MicrosoftMicrosoft's commercial cloud business hit an annual run    rate of over $14 billion last quarter -- a 49% jump from a   year earlier. CEO Satya Nadella expects that figure to hit $20   billion, or nearly a fifth of Microsoft's revenue, in fiscal   2018. That business generates most of its revenue from three   cloud services -- Office 365, Dynamics CRM (customer relationship   management), and the Azure cloud platform. Azure -- the second   largest cloud platform afterAmazon's(NASDAQ: AMZN) AWS (Amazon Web Services) -- hosts applications,   analyzes data, and loans out computing power.Microsoft pays a forward dividend yield of 2.4%, which is   supported by a payout ratio of 69%. The company has raised that   payout annually for 13 straight years. Analysts expect   Microsoft's revenue and earnings to respectively rise 5% and 7%   this year, but its valuation looks a bit rich at 31 times   earnings.IBMIBM's cloud business achieved an annual run  rate of   $13.7 billion last quarter, growing 35% from a year earlier and   accounting for 17% of its top line. Within that total, its cloud   services had an annual run rate of $8.6 billion -- a 61% jump   from 2015. Big Blue bundles all its public, private, and hybrid   cloud services into a platform called the IBM Cloud. Notable   products in that suite include its AI platform Watson, Blockchain   for digital transactions, and the Bluemix platform, which   competes against AWS and Azure.Big Blue pays a forward dividend yield of 3.2% with a payout   ratio of 44%. It's raised that dividend annually for 17 straight   years. Its P/E of 14 is much lower than its industry average of   21, but analysts expect its revenue to fall 2% this year and for   its earnings to rise just 2%.OracleOver the past few years, Oracle has grown its cloud businesses   to offset sluggish demand for its aging database and hardware   products. These products include a mix of SaaS, PaaS (platform as   a service), and IaaS (infrastructure as a service) products --   which  achieved a non-GAAP annual run rate of $5 billion   last quarter. Last quarter, Oracle's total cloud revenues rose   62% annually to $1.2 billion and accounted for 13% of the tech   giant's top line.Oracle's forward dividend yield of 1.4% is supported by a   payout ratio of just 28% -- indicating that the tech giant could   easily double its dividend if it wanted to. Nonetheless, Oracle's   five straight years of dividend hikes have kept the yield well   below 2%. Analysts expect Oracle's revenue and earnings to both   rise just 1% this year, but its multiple of 21 is well below the   industry average of 54 for application software makers.Hewlett-Packard EnterpriseHewlett-Packard Enterprise retained HP's enterprise hardware   and software businesses after splitting with the PC, printing,   and imaging businesses in late 2015. Shortly after the split, HPE   shut down  its Helion public cloud platform, which couldn't   compete against larger rivals like AWS. But HPE continued   providing support for private and hybrid cloud deployments, and   tethered those systems to AWS, Azure, and other leading public   cloud platforms. HPE's adjusted software revenue fell 1% annually   last quarter, but within that business, its cloud software as a   service (SaaS) revenue rose  6%.Image source: HPE.HPE's forward yield of 1.1% looks paltry, but its payout ratio   of 13% suggests that there's plenty of room for growth. Wall   Street expects HPE's revenue and earnings to remain nearly flat   this year, due to sluggish enterprise spending, but its trailing   P/E of 12 makes it one of the cheapest large cap tech plays on   the market today.The key takeawaysMicrosoft, IBM, Oracle, and HPE often showcase their cloud   growth, but none of these mature companies are generating massive   growth. That's because they're relying heavily on cloud growth to   offset weakness as their older businesses -- like Microsoft's   Windows, IBM's hardware and IT services, Oracle's database   systems, and HPE's aging enterprise hardware and software.   Investors should weigh the pros and cons of these companies   before investing in them as cloud or income plays.10 stocks we like better than IBMWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Why Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Stock Will Keep Jumping Higher;3/29/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsEarlier this month,Nvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA) announced the Jetson TX2, which is the latest iteration of the TX1, which NVDA describes as""the world's first supercomputer on a module.""The company designed the Jetson module as a tool to assist developers in advancing and creating new technology. Additionally, in partnership withMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT), Nvidia announced development of theHGX-1 Hyperscale GPU Accelerator, which promises improved performance and standardization for cloud-computing servers.makeArticleAd();Source: NvidiaThese tools will also serve NVDA stock investors (indirectly, of course), as they further the company's rise to the top of the AI industry ladder.Android Centraldescribed the Jetson TX2 best,saying:""The people who will build this technology of the future will need the tools to do so. In 2017, NVIDIA is doing its part, and the Jetson TX2 is the embodiment of this idea.""Simply put, the Jetson TX2 is a mini supercomputer that can process massive amounts of data on the spot, which can be a huge advantage for technology developers who would otherwise have had to upload all that data to an online server for cloud computing.10 Small-Cap Stocks That Could Double in the Next 3 MonthsWhat's more, NVDA's Jetson TX2 is capable of ""edge"" machine learning, a term that refers to the ability of the module to process, interpret and analyze data without the need to first upload it to the cloud, then download the resulting information and details. The TX2 has served its purpose quite successfully and it has helped Nvidia achieve its goal of simplifying developers' processes by reducing the number of steps required to garner important data.As far as the HGX-1, NVDAbelievesthat:The HGX-1 hyperscale GPU accelerator will do for AI cloud computing what the ATX standard did to make PCs pervasive today. It will enable cloud-service providers to easily adopt NVIDIA GPUs to meet surging demand for AI computing.More Iconic Brands Rely on NVDA Than You Might RealizeHistorically, Nvidia has been known for its industry-leading graphics cards. But, NVDA stock is much more than a computer GPU maker. Sure, the company still produces some of the most advanced GPUs that make hardcore gamers drool, but graphics processors are actually capable of much more.While high-end GPUs will, obviously, improve PC video quality and reduce or eliminate that annoying screen lag when you're playing a first-person shooter game, they're also used for a surprising number of non-visual applications.For instance,Alphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) andTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) use Nvidia GPU technology in the development of their respective driverless cars.Volkswagen AG (ADR)(OTCMKTS:VLKAY) andDaimler AG's(OTCMKTS:DDAIF) Audi brand have also been using Nvidia GPU units in their own driverless vehicle development projects. These companiesuse the NVDA Drive PX2- which, according toForbes,shares the renowned Tegra Parker silicon as the Jetson TX2.Beyond just autonomous vehicles, though, Nvidia GPU devices have been used by medical scientists and pharmaceutical companies to investigate and better understand the effects of aging. Using GPUs made by NVDA, biotech companies such asInSilicoemploy AI to analyze large data sets and""emulate human brain function""in an attempt to combat diseases related to old age and reduce the cost of healthcare.Why the Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock Comeback Is Just BeginningSimilarly, at its annual Open Compute Project summit earlier this month,Facebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) announced a cutting-edge AI server dubbed Big Basin, which features""no less than eight Nvidia Tesla P100 GPU accelerators.""Bottom Line on NVDA StockAll things considered, Nvidia stock's meteoric rise in the field of artificial intelligence shows no signs of slowing. With the release of the Jetson TX2 module, coupled with the upcoming HGX-1 accelerator, NVDA stock has addressed - seemingly quite successfully - mobile/field R&D as well as the cloud computing needs of AI developers.For Nvidia stock, this is a solid sign that the past year's 213% gains will continue.As of this writing, Greg Gambone did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 Clobbered Stocks to Buy That Are About to Get Red-HotThe 7 WORST Stocks to Buy Right NowThe postWhy Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Stock Will Keep Jumping Higherappeared first onInvestorPlace."

AT&T (T) to Shut Down U-Verse and Shift Users to DIRECTV;3/29/2017;"Per a recentFierceCablereport, U.S. telecom behemothAT&T Inc.Tis planning to completely phase out its long-standing U-verse brand by May 30. The brand consists of fiber-based triple-play video (TV), voice (telephony) and high-speed broadband (Internet) offerings. This move is in line with AT&T's strategy to discontinue the service. The service has faced blackout in 23 states since Mar 15.Accordingly, AT&T plans to shift some U-verse customers to satellite TV service provider DIRECTV, while some will be transferred to its over the top (OTT) online streaming service, DirecTV Now. By venturing into the OTT space, AT&T joined the likes of DISH Network Corp'sDISHInternet TV service - Sling TV and Sony Corporation'sSNEPlaystation Vue, respectively.Notably, AT&T earned $13,206 million revenue in the Entertainment Group Segment, up 1.6% year over year (post the DIRECTV acquisition). Of the total, Video entertainment revenues were $9,567 million, up 3.5%. As of Dec 31, 2016, total Satellite connections tallied 21,012,000 and U-verse connections were 4,253,000. AT&T lost 262,000 U-verse customers but gained 235,000 satellite TV customers.This proves the company's strategic shift from its U-verse customers to the DIRECTV brand to be a positive one. In fact, this move bodes well with the weakening performing of U-verse brand compared to the improved business of DIRECTV. Moving ahead, this in turn is expected to free up very important bandwidth on its fiber-optic network, which AT&T can utilize to offer higher data transmission speeds to its high-speed broadband users.The company officials have already started informing customers about the shutdown of the service. Moreover, the U-verse multi-screen app is also likely to get removed from Microsoft Corporation'sMSFTXbox One and Windows mobile platforms.However, the final call is yet to be confirmed by the company.Over the past three months, shares of AT&T lost 2.6% as compared with the Zacks categorizedWireless Nationalindustry's 4.3% decline. This was mainly led by the company's operations in a saturated wireless market, where spectrum crunch is a major concern. Additionally, persistent losses in access lines, mounting operating expenses, losses incurred from promotional offers, stringent regulatory norms and union issues act as major dampeners for the company's growth prospects.AT&T currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Is the Microsoft Xbox Game Pass Worth $10 per Month?;3/28/2017;"Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) recently jumped on the subscription service   bandwagon with the announcement of Xbox Game Pass. For $10 per   month, Xbox One owners can have access to over 100 Xbox One and   backward compatible Xbox 360 games.One of the attractive features of the service is the ability   to download the full game directly to the Xbox One console, so   players can enjoy each title without worrying about internet   connectivity issues. The service also allows gamers to buy   games at a discount.On the flip side, titles included with the service will be   cycled in and out on a monthly basis, which will limit the   selection and potentially the service's overall popularity.makeArticleAd();Game Pass will not appeal to everyoneXbox Game Pass will not appeal to gamers interested in new     releases. Image source: Microsoft.Xbox Game Pass does not offer new releases -- no service will   likely ever offer that to gamers at just $10 per month. And while   there is no information available regarding the terms Microsoft   negotiated with publishers, they are obviously not going to sell   a new release for $10 or less when a full game download typically   ranges from from $30 to $60.In some cases, I have seen people compare Xbox Game Pass to   other entertainment streaming services like Spotify orNetflix. Although Xbox Game Pass offers the same convenience, it   falls short of other popular entertainment services on the   breadth of selection. Netflix,AppleMusic, Spotify, andAmazonPrime cost about the same price per month, but these services   usually offer subscribers access to massive libraries, including   new and original content.Microsoft targets used game buyersThe new Xbox service appears to be takingdirect aimatGameStop's used game business. GameStop believes it is the largest   retailer of pre-owned games in the world. In each of the   last three years, GameStop has generated approximately $1 billion   in gross profit from pre-owned game sales -- accounting for   nearly half of its gross profit each year.  As physical   game sales fade, some of that $1 billion will begin flowing back   to publishers and console makers, but it may not happen   overnight.While Xbox Game Pass will likely lure some customers away from   Gamestop, I don't expect Microsoft to deal a death blow -- at   least not yet. The transition will ultimately be driven by the   quality of games includes with the service.But all of the games shown in the image on Microsoft's   announcement are at least one year old. A few high profile games   listed in theannouncementareHalo 5andNBA 2K16. Consumers can buy those titles pre-owned from Gamestop for $15   to $30. Once they play it for a month or two and trade it back to   the store, gamers would net about the same cost with Xbox   Game Pass as going the used game route. GameStop also has a   slight edge over the Microsoft service considering the   month-to-month cycling of the Game Pass catalogue.Image source: Microsoft.Leading game developers shun the servicePart of the problem with Game Pass' limited selection is the   lack of support fromElectronic Arts,Ubisoft Entertainment, andActivision Blizzard-- three giant publishers. Electronic Arts has its own   subscription service -- EA Access -- exclusive on Xbox, so it's   likely we will never see EA join Xbox Game Pass unless its own   offering falters.In aninterviewwith Gamespot, head of the Xbox business Phil Spencer said it   took two or three years to launch Xbox Game Pass due to   challenges, including signing deals with third-party   publishers:It's taken so long because Microsoft had to get the     under-the-hood, technical specifics worked out, while the     company also had to sign business deals with third-party     publishers.If Microsoft wasn't able to recruit Activision or Ubisoft over   several years, it's unlikely those companies are going to sign up   any time soon. Activision Blizzard is focused on making new,   major releases that allow the company to deliver a steady flow of   downloadable content to millions of players. Releasing older   games to Game Pass could potentially steer players to those   titles where Activision is generating less revenue.As a result of these shortcomings, Xbox Game Pass will only   appeal to subscribers interested in having access to older games.   But at just $10 per month and with new titles regularly being   added to the library (and the potential for future partnerships   with other developers), both casual and hardcore gamers can   probably find something to like in this service.10 stocks we like better than MicrosoftWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Is Apple Looking to Expand in the Augmented Reality World?;3/28/2017;"Apple IncAAPLis accelerating its efforts in the AR space, reports The Financial Times. However, it adds that a retail launch is unlikely to happen in the near future.There have been quite a few rumors regarding Apple's AR efforts, as CEO Tim Cook has emphasized on developing the technology time and again in the last few months. Cook had reiterated the company's AR efforts for the first time at its third quarter fiscal 2016 earnings conference call. He has been quoted saying ""AR can be really great, and we have been and continue to invest a lot in this. We are high on AR for the long run. We think there are great things for customers and a great commercial opportunity."" In fact, he has been quoted by media reports saying not VR but AR will be ""the larger of the two, probably by far"".In November last year, Bloomberg stated that Apple was mulling over venturing into the wearable headsets space but is unlikely to initiate ""mass production"" as it has just ordered a small number of near-eye displays for testing purposes from a supplier. Bloomberg also claimed that if all goes well then AR glasses will wirelessly connect to an iPhone and will display information and images directly in front of the user's field of view.Moreover, in January this year, tech blogger, Robert Scoble, citing a Carl Zeiss employee, stated that Appleis working on AR/mixed reality headsets and has partnered with the renowned lens maker. He was more optimistic about retail launch as he stated that the glasses could hit stores as early as this year.Apple Inc. PriceApple Inc. Price|Apple Inc. QuoteHowever, Apple has refrained from commenting on any of these rumors. The company has a habit of maintaining secrecy regarding its new products.Apple is under tremendous pressure to introduce new offerings, as it's most important growth driver-the iPhone-faces decelerating demand. iPhone alone contributed about 70% of Apple's total revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.Better-than-expected iPhone 7 and 7 Plus sales have definitely come as a respite. But the macroeconomic headwinds remain for now, especially in China, one of its high-growth regions. Apple revenues declined around 12% year over year in the Greater China region to $16.2 billion. Also, competition from local players has been hindering iPhone's growth in this region. Slowdown in demand from key regions like China, if continued, can significantly impact Apple's financials going ahead.Apple has been exploring newer growth avenues to boost its topline. With so much buzz created by AR/VR and AI technologies, the company has started to focus on its development. These are fast emerging as lucrative business opportunities. According to a recent IDC report, global revenues of the AR/VR market are expected to grow at a CAGR of 181.3% from $5.2 billion in 2016 to over $162 billion in 2020.  Bloomberg, which quoted Global Market Insights figures, reported that the global market for AR products will surge 80% to $165 billion by 2024.Per Bloomberg, Apple has built a team combining people who have experience in working on Facebook'sFBOculus and Microsoft'sMSFTHoloLens. The company has also acquired several smaller firms with expertise in AR hardware, 3D gaming and virtual reality software. These include Flyby Media, Emotient, TupleJump, Turi, Metaio and PrimeSense.Not only Apple, but all tech giants-right from AlphabetGOOGL, Facebook to Microsoft-are scrambling to grab a share of this lucrative market. Facebook had acquired Oculus in 2012 to fuel the company's ambitious VR efforts. Moreover, media reports add that Facebook is likely to unveil four consumer hardware products at this year's F8. These include drones, brain scanning technology, AR and next gen cameras. In March 2016, Microsoft started shipping its AR headset, HoloLens.Zacks Rank & Stock Price MovementAt present, Apple carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock Gears Up for War;3/28/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMD) stock has quite literally skyrocketed over the past year, as shares of AMD are up nearly 400%, while theNasdaqis up only 22% over the same period.makeArticleAd();Source:Matthew Rutledge via FlickrWith the release of its Ryzen 7 processor line earlier this month, and the Ryzen 5 products slated for April 11, more than a fewanalysts on the Street have issued upgradesand raised price targets for AMD stock.According toMarketWatch,11 of the 29 analysts providing recommendations call AMD stock a ""buy"" and 15 call it a hold.Why the Recent Spike for AMD Stock?For decades, the often-challenged (but undisputed) big dog in the CPU arena has beenIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC). Today, the Intel Core i7 is considered by many to be one of, if notthetop performing consumer desktop processor. But, now that the AMD Ryzen is available, tech experts haveconducted benchmark teststhat show the Ryzen equal to, and in some cases better than, the Core i7.Further, AMD is preparing to face off against Intel on the enterprise side as well, having announced a partnership withMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) todevelop a data center chip, dubbed Naples. According to an AMD executive,""Next quarter AMD will bring hardware innovation back into the datacenter and server markets.""So AMD will simultaneously compete with INTC on two fronts, enterprise and consumer. According toForbes, upward of 95% of the world's servers are powered by Intel, but now is definitely the time that companies will be most open to consider switching from Intel to AMD.""For the first time in many years, AMD could pose a real threat to Intel's server supremacy.""Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Will Change the PC IndustryThis is exciting news for AMD stock investors, as it seems to alleviate some of the concerns about a potential correction in the relatively near future. At this point, AMD stock is still soaring and will continue to do so as the company chips away at Intel's market share.Bottom Line on AMD StockThe technology industry is perhaps one of the most competitive of all, with new startups appearing almost daily. The potential for shifting market share is often more fluid than in other industries, as innovation is the true king here. And in the tech sector, innovation is the lifeblood of any successful company.To that end, AMD's ability to remain on top is only as secure as its latest silicon creation. While the company has done fairly well remaining innovative on its own, there is even greater potential going forward with Microsoft's help and involvement.AMD stock price hasn't been this high in more than a decade, and considering the state of the technology industry, particularly CPU development, this is one stock that has solid potential for longer-term growth going forward.As of this writing, Greg Gambone did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace3 Short Squeeze Stocks to Buy in a Bull Market10 Small-Cap Stocks That Could Double in the Next 3 MonthsWhy the Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock Comeback Is Just BeginningThe postAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc.

Twitter Is Looking to Diversify Its Revenue With a Paid Subscription;3/28/2017;"Twitter's(NYSE:TWTR) struggles to keep growing ad revenue have led it to search for   alternative revenue streams. Its most recent idea is a paid   subscription for ""a new, more enhanced version of Tweetdeck,"" a   Twitter spokesperson toldThe Verge. Twitter bought Tweetdeck in 2011, and it allows users to manage   multiple accounts, view responses and activity, create   collections of tweets, and more.The paid product would be aimed at marketers, journalists,   professionals, and anyone else that wants to ""find out what is   happening in the world quicker, to gain more insights, and see   the broadest range of what people are saying on Twitter,""   according to a survey Twitter sent out. It would also get rid of   ads for those users.Twitter provides a lot of value to journalists and marketers,   and it could take a tip fromMicrosoft's(NASDAQ: MSFT) LinkedIn for developing paid solutions to their   problems. Most of LinkedIn's revenue, in fact, comes from its   paid services. With Twitter's ad revenue expected to decline this   year, a new revenue stream could be a huge boost for Twitter.makeArticleAd();Image source: Getty Images.Making it easier to use TwitterWhen Jack Dorsey reassumed the role of CEO at Twitter, he   said, ""The product remains too difficult to use."" He was mostly   referring to the steep learning curve for new users, but even   power users could be left wanting.Management continuously touts how news breaks on Twitter   before the major news networks pick it up. If Twitter can make it   easier for journalists to find breaking stories, gather comments   from interested parties, and put an entire report together,   that's providing a real value to journalist -- a value they (or   their employers) might be willing to pay a monthly subscription   price for.Many marketers already pay for third-party analytics to see   what's working with the accounts they manage and what doesn't. If   Twitter can provide those insights and content suggestions all   from its own dashboard, marketers may be willing to pay for that   service.Following in LinkedIn's footstepsTwitter could do for journalists what LinkedIn did for   recruiters.LinkedIn's professional network is an unmatched asset. It   monetizes that asset by selling access to recruiters. LinkedIn's   2016 run rate for its hiring solutions products was $2.1 billion   before Microsoft bought the company in the fourth quarter. For   reference, Twitter's total 2016 revenue was $2.5 billion.But Twitter's job is a little more difficult than providing   access. It already does that, twice over. Its data licensing   business provides its firehose of data to various outfits that   use it to analyze anything from consumer sentiment to the stock   market. Its basic free product also offers access to just about   anyone you might be interested in hearing more from.For Twitter to sell a paid service, it will have to offer   better ways to organize and analyze all the information people   are sharing on its network. And it will have to do it better than   anyone else is. That's a tall order, but nobody is better   positioned to do it than Twitter itself.The need for a new revenue streamTwitter is expected to suffer a revenue decline this year   afterde-emphasizing some of its ad products. Twitter is most focused on video and video advertising,   spending heavily on content deals and developing new technology.   While video ads are generally higher-priced and higher-margined,   Twitter faces significant competition in the video ad space from   other social networks. It has a much better advantage as a source   for news information.If Twitter can successfully launch a paid service, it would be   a huge boon to Twitter and its investors if it can develop a   product where it has a much more significant competitive   advantage than it does in video advertising.It could also take the focus off Twitter's stagnant user   growth, and shine a light on the value of its core power   users.A premium version of Tweetdeck is by no means a sure thing --   we don't even know if Twitter will actually release such a   product. But Twitter needs to find a way to diversify beyond   advertising besides just providing wholesale licenses to its   stream of data.10 stocks we like better than TwitterWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

GameStop (GME) Closes 150 Stores As Videogame Industry Turns Digital;3/27/2017;"The shift of consumer behavior has affected all retail industries. After some of the biggest retailers, such as J.C. PennyJCP, Macy'sM,SearsSHLD, and many others, reported nationwide store closures, GameStopGME, the world's largest video game retailer, is the next to join the list.The Texas-based company reported its fourth quarter and fiscal 2016 earnings on Thursday. GameStop reported a positive earnings surprise for the fifth straight quarter; however, it also missed the sales estimates for the third consecutive quarter.The company posted adjusted earnings of $2.38 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.29 per share. Revenues of $3.05 billion fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.12 billion. (For the complete report on GameStop's Q4 earnings report, check out this Zacks article:GameStop (GME) Tops Q4 Earnings, Stock Tumbles on Drab View)GameStop's stock tanked 16% on Friday and closed with the day at $20.70 per share after it announced that it plans to shutter at least 150 stores and expand nongaming business in earnings.""As our non-gaming business drove gross margin expansion and significantly contributed to our profits,"" said CEO Paul Raines. ""Meanwhile, the video game category was weak, particularly in the back half of 2016, as the console cycle ages.""The physical video game market was hit hard as a whole. GameStop's competitor Best BuyBBYalso noted in its latest earnings report that video game sales were down. The decline in sales is most likely the result of consumers' shift to buying games digitally.Piper JaffrayPJCanalyst Michael Olson told TheStreet, ""We're seeing more games being sold digitally, as 25% of the games are sold as full-game downloaded."" He expects video game purchasing eventually will be ""100% download and streaming,"" with the increase of Internet speed and greater storage capacity on gaming consoles.The moneymakers of GameStop also aren't performing as well as it did. The new gaming consoles from Microsoft Corp.MSFTand Nintendo Co.NTDOYthis year might not provide as much as they once did. The sales from reselling used games, which has better margins than for new games or hardware, have not been doing well either because of the rise of digital download that produces no physical disc to be swapped later.For game publishers, the transformation to digital download is great news. The profit is more lucrative from full-game download than packaged games. Video game console makers also see this as a profitable trend for them. Both Microsoft and SonySNEintroduced video game subscriptions, which allow users to pay a fee per month for unlimited access to games online.While GameStop's traditional moneymakers have been suffering, the company's collectible store hopes to ligthen investors' worry. Their collectibles operation saw sales surge almost 60% in fiscal 2016 and is expected to increase another 30% to 40% for 2017. As of Jan 28, there are 86 collectible stores, and the company looks to open 35 more this year.As the trend of full-download and e-commerce continues, GameStop's legacy in video game brick-and-mortar business might soon be different.GameStop is trading at $20.85 per share, up 0.72% on Monday.Interested in the video game industry?

Why AT&T Inc. (T) Stock Will Run Much Farther Than You Think;3/27/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsUsually, it's not a good thing when the first adjective that comes to mind about a particular investment is ""boring."" That descriptor conjures up images of retirement homes, bingo games, and amateur golf tourneys that frequently go over par. It's the exact opposite of what you want to sell if you were an up-and-coming stockbroker. ButAT&T Inc. (NYSE:T) is that rare animal that wears boredom well.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockFirst and foremost, when discussing T stock, we have to acknowledge the AT&T andTime Warner Inc(NYSE:TWX) merger.As InvestorPlace's Lawrence Meyers notes, it's a done deal. TWX shareholders have approved the merger, which makes T stock compelling again. He furtherstatedthat ""in a matter of two years, AT&T stock has gone from moribund telecom play with a great dividend to a media powerhouse with a great dividend.""Then there's the matter of T's acquisition of DirecTV. Regularly squaring off against rivalDISH Network Corp(NASDAQ:DISH), DirecTV deliversbetter content, particularly if you're a sports fan. As a side note, DISH is off more than 22% from its highs of 2014. T stock, in sharp contrast, is just a few cents short of its all-time high (on an adjusted basis).But this brings us to an important question. Is T stock still worth buying at these elevated levels? Just a few years ago, AT&T was something more appropriate for ""widows and orphans,"" according to Meyers. No one - even those with deep pockets - wants to be caught holding the bag.T Stock Is Built Like a TankFortunately, I don't think it's possible to hold the bag on AT&T. Of course, you never say never - I've been burnt before with premature ramblings. I certainly don't want to repeat the mistakes of occasionally misguided youth. But a select group of companies do exist that are too big and frankly, too boring to fail.More From InvestorPlace7 Consumer Stocks That Will Lead Your PortfolioIt's often said that when people flip the switch on, they expect to see light. When that doesn't happen, as in the case of power outages, people go a little crazy. Extend the blackout for a prolonged period of time, and you will have a major crisis on your hands. It's cynical, but that's why utility companies will always be in business. You can be grossly negligent likeTohoku Electric Power Co., Inc. (Japan)(OTCMKTS:TEPCY) and still get away with it.The same analogy can be carried over to the telecommunications industry. People need their internet, and access to other digital devices. No internet and no TV is tantamount to a powder keg ready to burst. And AT&T has gotten so big that it's probably not possible for it to totally implode into oblivion. That's one reason why T stock is largely considered worry-free investing.The other reason is that AT&T is unlikely to become irrelevant. InvestorPlace feature writer James Brumleystatesthat the company ""is already capable of delivering broadband to millions of houses and businesses across the nation, and it's also capable of providing 4G wireless (soon to be 5G wireless) from coast to coast."" Even with this advantage, AT&T is nearing implementation of its AirGig technology - essentially, internet through electric utility lines.So no, bag-holding on the fundamentals is definitely not a concern.AT&T Stock: The Trend Is Your FriendOf course, investment profits and losses are realized via the markets. It doesn't matter how great the fundamentals are if the technicals won't follow suit. Naturally, buying near all-time highs will cause any investor to take a step back before pulling the trigger.However, T stock is bolstered by a number of attributes that makes it distinct from other opportunities. First, outside of rare exceptions, AT&T stock does not incur devastating, double-digit volatility. Aside from 2001, 2002 and 2008, the average down years measures only 6.7%. Chances are, if you pick T stock at an inopportune moment, you should recover fairly quickly.Buy Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock Without All the RiskClick to EnlargeThe second factor favoring AT&T stock is its upward bias. During the first quarter, returns for T stock are poor, averaging losses of 0.4% from the start of January to March end. Things pick up over the next three quarters, returning slightly over 13% so far.Finally, you just have to trust the long-term trend for T stock. And that's really no step of faith. Since 1984, only two pronounced periods of bearishness are evident: the collapse of the tech bubble, and the Great Recession. Since we're not going to suffer through macro-level pessimism all the time, AT&T stock is as reliable as a benchmark index fund.Buying any company at all-time highs is never preferable. But holding onto preference could stymie profitability. T stock isn't the flavor of the week. It's built for the long-term, and for that purpose, AT&T has few genuine competitors.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 Small-Cap Stocks That Could Double in the Next 3 MonthsThe 7 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for the Second QuarterThe postWhy AT&T Inc.

Are Oracle Corporation (ORCL) Stock’s Cloud Promises Just Empty Rhetoric?;3/27/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOracle Corporation(NASDAQ:ORCL) Chairman Larry Ellison may be one of the best trash talkers in Silicon Valley if not in all of corporate America.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockDuring the software company's latest earnings call, Ellison set his sights onAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN), the market leader in the fast-growing cloud market. He noted that Oracle workloads run ten times as fast as Amazon and are cheaper to boot.""As a result, some of our largest customers' are negotiating huge infrastructure-as-a-service contracts to move all their databases to the Oracle cloud,"" the cantankerous billionaire said. ""You can expect some of those big deals to be announced in the coming weeks.""Of course, he didn't name any names, nor did he offer any specifics. Investors need to view Ellison's boasts with skepticism because ORCL is still a small fish in the big pond that is the cloud market.During its latest quarter,ORCL reported $1.01 billionin cloud software as a service (SaaS) and platform as a service (PaaS), a year-over-year increase of 11 percent. Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) sales were $178 million, up 2 percent.7 Consumer Stocks That Will Lead Your PortfolioTotal cloud revenue rose 62 percent to $1.2 billion in the most recent quarter and is forecast to slow down to 29 percent in the current quarter. Co-CEO Safra Catz's has forecast that cloud revenue ($3.2 billion over the past nine months) would overtake license revenue ($3.7 billion during that same time.). The company gave an estimated run-rate for the business of about $5 billion.AMZN, though, has a huge head start on ORCL as do other rivals. The e-commerce giant'sAmazon Web Servicescloud division surged 47% in 2016 to $3.5 billion, indicating a run of about $14 billion. Sales forMicrosoft Corporation's(NASDAQ:MSFT) Intelligent Cloud rose 8% (10% in constant currency) to $6.9 billion in its latest quarter. The Redmond, Wash.-based company has forecast a ""commercial annualized revenue run rate"" topping $14 billion.International Business Machines Corp.(NYSE:IBM), for its part, reported $13.7 billion in cloud revenue last year.Keep in mind that these company all likely define ""cloud revenue"" differently than one another, but even among the most optimistic of scenarios, it appears as though ORCL is in no position to catch Amazon or any other major cloud players for years if ever.What This Means for ORCL StockDoes that mean that investors should dismiss Oracle's cloud boasts? No.Remember that ORCL has deep relationships with enterprises of all sizes. The company's database software is what's known as ""sticky"" in the tech world, meaning that it would be a huge pain to get rid of it. Chief Information Officers would rather deal with the devil they know, as ORCL is a horned creature with which they know intimately. ORCL will be able to bundle its software and services with cloud offering, driving down the price of cloud services for all.Moreover, Ellison has never been shy about making acquisitions to ""buy"" growth in fast-growing areas like the cloud.Walt Disney Co (DIS) Stock Is Still More Beast Than BeautyShares of ORCL have been on a roll this year, gaining more than 16%, outperforming rivals such as IBM and MSFT, both of which posted single-digit increases. The shares are trading at about 6% discount to their average 52-week price target of $47.97. Though the valuation isn't particularly appealing now, the stock might be worth picking up if there is a pullback.After all, Wall Street has underestimated Ellison for years.As of this writing, Jonathan Berr doesn't own any shares of any of the stocks mentioned above.More From InvestorPlaceThe 7 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for the Second Quarter9 Cheap Stocks to Buy Now Under $9 a ShareThe postAre Oracle Corporation (ORCL) Stock's Cloud Promises Just Empty Rhetoric?appeared first onInvestorPlace."

Interesting January 2018 Stock Options for MSFT;3/27/2017;"Consistently, one of the more popular stocks people enter into theirstock options watchlistat Stock Options Channel is Microsoft Corporation (Symbol: MSFT). So this week we highlight one interesting put contract, and one interesting call contract, from the January 2018 expiration for MSFT. The put contract our YieldBoost algorithm identified as particularly interesting, is at the $52.50 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $1.40. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 2.7% return against the $52.50 commitment, or a 3.3% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this theYieldBoost).Selling a put does not give an investor access to MSFT's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. So unless Microsoft Corporation sees its shares decline 18.8% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $51.10 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $1.40 from $52.50), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 3.3% annualized rate of return.makeArticleAd();Worth considering, is that the annualized 3.3% figure actually exceeds the 2.4% annualized dividend paid by Microsoft Corporation, based on the current share price of $64.72. And yet, if an investor was to buy the stock at the going market price in order to collect the dividend, there is greater downside because the stock would have to lose 18.82% to reach the $52.50 strike price.Always important when discussing dividends is the fact that, in general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of Microsoft Corporation, looking at the dividend history chart for MSFT below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 2.4% annualized dividend yield.Turning to the other side of the option chain, we highlight one call contract of particular interest for the January 2018 expiration, for shareholders of Microsoft Corporation (Symbol: MSFT) looking to boost their income beyond the stock's 2.4% annualized dividend yield. Selling the covered call at the $70 strike and collecting the premium based on the $2.22 bid, annualizes to an additional 4.2% rate of return against the current stock price (this is what we at Stock Options Channel refer to as theYieldBoost), for a total of 6.6% annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away. Any upside above $70 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away, but MSFT shares would have to advance 8.2% from current levels for that to happen, meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called, the shareholder has earned a 11.7% return from this trading level, in addition to any dividends collected before the stock was called.The chart below shows the trailing twelve month trading history for Microsoft Corporation, highlighting in green where the $52.50 strike is located relative to that history, and highlighting the $70 strike in red:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the January 2018 put or call options highlighted in this article deliver a rate of return that represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Microsoft Corporation (considering the last 252 trading dayMSFT historical stock pricesusing closing values, as well as today's price of $64.72) to be 19%.Top YieldBoost MSFT Calls »"

Buy Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock Without All the Risk;3/27/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThere's good reasons to be bullishly optimistic onMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) these days. But for investors, there's less reason to be exposed to unnecessary risks both off and on the Microsoft stock price chart. The good news is you don't have to be. Let me explain.makeArticleAd();Source:Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified)MSFT stock may not be the go-go growth stock it was back when dial-up internet services and Socks.com were still vying for investors' attention. But that's not entirely bad news for Microsoft investors.For a company still somewhat synonymous with the ubiquitous Windows OS and PC market, great strides beyond those legacy businesses have been made - strides which, overall, continue to bode well for Microsoft stock.Where Microsoft StandsThe fact is, Microsoft has captured strong market share and is enjoying robust growth in budding markets such as the cloud, artificial intelligence and augmented reality which should support the company's reboot for the next quarter of a century and beyond.Some of the solid rebuild has been organic and under the stewardship of Microsoft's well-respected CEO Satya Nadella and whose ""Mobile First, Cloud First"" philosophy and technological vision is a major driver.There have also been smart acquisitions and alliances which should benefit MSFT stock investors going forward. For one, last year's $26 billion buyout ofLinkedIngives Microsoft access to the world's most dominant player in the business networking space.7 Consumer Stocks That Will Lead Your PortfolioWith LinkedIn's membership nearing a half-billion users and Microsoft integrating the service into its Dynamics CRM platform, the impact should ensure more growth in this market and act as yet another support for Microsoft stock and its shareholders.More recently, last week it was officially announced Microsoft andAdobe Systems Incorporated(NASDAQ:ADBE) willcollaborate in this marketand one increasingly reliant on the use of artificial intelligence for stronger productivity.The partnership integrates Microsoft Dynamics 365 and Adobe Experience Manager to this end. Customers can now better manipulate information and obtain stronger client outcomes. As standalone platforms, this wasn't possible earlier and should help Microsoft compete against business rivalsSalesforce.com, Inc.(NYSE:CRM) andOracle Corporation(NYSE:ORCL).Bottom line, Microsoft stock continues to look quite promising for delivering shareholder value beyond healthy stock buybacks and dependable dividend payouts as the reboot of Microsoft 2.0 continues to offer growth opportunities off the chart.Microsoft Stock Weekly ChartOn the MSFT price chart and since writing aboutMicrosoft stock in mid-February, not much has changed in the bank accounts of shareholders. But that's far from a bad thing. Microsoft stock is up about .75% over the last several weeks and has continued to trade in a tight consolidation.More specific, a bullish, flat-and-tight inside base of eight weeks has developed on top of a very constructive longer-term technical picture. Now and as stochastics flirts with an oversold condition, MSFT stock's uptrend is looking quite friendly for intermediate-minded investors to enter into a collar position.MSFT Stock Collar StrategyReviewing the MSFT options board, I like using a collar on Microsoft stock for positioning as part of a core holding within a portfolio.Specifically and with MSFT at $64.98, an investor can sell the April $67.50 call and simultaneously buy the April $62.50 put for a debit of 10 cents. In conjunction with the purchase of shares, the collar costs $65.08.In my last article, the suggestion was for Microsoft investors to incorporate the sale of the $60 put. At the time and with shares at $64.38, this created an even-money, modified collar. Now though, and with the put trading for a measly 7 cents and earnings embedded in the April contract, it's a less sensible risk.Should an investor purchase the regular collar, for the extra 10 cents premium paid, downside risk is contained to less than 4%. Having that kind of protection in place through earnings, andeven the occasional anomaly, is nice insurance to have.The real cost of the collar would be if MSFT produced an abnormally large upside reaction following the earnings event. Profits are initially capped at just under 4% and matching the downside risk.Trade Twitter Inc (TWTR) Stock While the Market Is SubduedThe good news is the likelihood of MSFT moving more than 4% to 5% by a substantial amount is historically small. Throw in an expensive overall market and MSFT not being impervious to those pricing concerns either, and it's a risk thought worth taking.Lastly, if Microsoft shares did surprise with a stock reaction through the sold call strike, the trader can continue to roll the collar up and out and trend trade the stock for additional gains.Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in any of the securities or their derivatives mentioned in this article.

Better Than Cash: 8% Payouts “Hedged” Against a Market Pullback (QYLD, EOS);3/27/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIf you're worried about a pullback, I don't blame you. But don't sit in cash and earn nothing when you can hedge your portfolio AND collect yields up to 8%.makeArticleAd();Let's talk about a couple of funds that use a well-worn options tactic - writing ""covered calls"" - that can generate generous yields typically between 7% and 9%. Conveniently, you never have to deal with the complications of options contracts - these funds do all the work for you!But,why covered calls, and why now?Covered calls are an options strategy in which you sell call option contracts against stocks you hold. Selling the call options generates income, called a ""premium."" From there, a couple things can happen. If your stock reaches the strike price of the call option, you're obligated to sell your shares to the call buyer (but you still keep the premium). If your stock stays below the strike price, you still keep the premium, and you can keep your shares - and from there, if you'd like, you can keep selling covered calls against them for more income.Ziegler Capital Management, a specialty investment bank out of Chicago, extols the virtues of covered calls (emphasis mine):""Investors often consider the income from the sale of the call option as a form of downside protection. As a result of this income, covered call strategies have historically generated impressive results compared to the S&P 500 Index in terms of risk mitigation and volatility reduction. … Over a market cycle,covered call strategies have tended to produce equity-like returns with lower beta and lower volatility.""10 Mutual Funds You Can Buy and Hold ForeverThis strategy does limit your upside during raging bull markets, but whether we're about to fly into some market turbulence, or on the slim chance that a significant downturn is nigh, covered calls are the place to be.And if you don't want to deal with the complexity of trading options, don't worry.

This is a passive index that executes the same strategy, month after month, on a single index, without any regard to whether the fund is actually getting any value out of the premiums it's collecting. In some cases, the premium isn't nearly enough to cover the risk of selling the options.As a result, QYLD -as I mentioned a few weeks ago- has been a dud. Despite a nearly 8% yield (paid monthly), QYLD hasn't just trailed the annualized 15.3% return of the Nasdaq-100 since 2014 - which we would expect because of covered calls' limited upside in bull markets - but at just 5.6% annualized, price losses have eaten away at investors' income!Recon Capital's QYLD Has Been a Yield Trap for YearsEaton Vance Enhanced Income Fund II (EOS)Dividend Yield:7.8%Sometimes, cheap, passive investing works.

Current and Future Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Stock Owners, Keep an Eye on This;3/27/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsLast week, chipmaker - and graphics processing specialist -Nvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA) unveiled some encouraging but perhaps unusual news. That is, Chinese internet powerhouseTencent Holdings Ltd(OTCMKTS:TCTZF) hasselected Nvidia as the providerof its core hardware needed to make Tencent's artificial intelligence ambitions a reality.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockIt was odd, simply because that's not what Nvidia does. A more conventional computer processor and chipset name likeAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMD) orIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) would make more sense serving as the backbone for a new AI system.Thing is, this isn't the first time owners of NVDA stock have heard of the company's hardware being selected as the centerpiece of an artificial intelligence system. Just two weeks ago, Nvidia was tapped byMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) topower the next generationof its AI offering.What gives?As it turns out, traditional computer processors like Intel's Core and Pentium CPUs or AMD'sRyzenaren't necessarily best-suited for the ultra-high-speed processing needs the rise of AI has created. Investors - and not just NVDA stock holders - would be wise to note the nuance, as AI is expected to become a$16 billion marketby 2022, andgrow to $36 billionby 2025.GPU Technology vs. CPU TechnologyHistorically, while the hardware and firmware supporting a computer's (or laptop's) display screen was a key part of its performance, a device's heart and soul was its processor, or CPU. It operates… well, everything at blazing fast speed, with more RAM (memory) helping out.7 Consumer Stocks That Will Lead Your PortfolioThe graphics processing unit, or GPU, wasn't a dealmaker or a dealbreaker.As computers have become faster and more powerful, though, and performance expectations have swelled, GPUs have become very, very impressive, in many cases fully taking on the display-management role that was otherwise taken on by the CPU. Indeed, a GPU is some4thing of a mini-computer in itself…… and they're very, very fast. That makes them perfect for high-speed artificial intelligence applications, where the quantity of computations is more important than the depth or complexity of those computations.An entry posted at the Nvidia corporate blog in the middle of last year not only served as something of an omen to the tech world, but to savvy owners of Nvidia stock as well.It explains:""Computer programs contain commands that are largely executed sequentially. Deep learning is a fundamentally new software model where billions of software-neurons and trillions of connections are trained, in parallel. Running DNN algorithms and learning from examples, the computer is essentially writing its own software. This radically different software model needs a new computer platform to run efficiently. dlboost-3-webAccelerated computing is an ideal approach and the GPU is the ideal processor. As Nature recently noted, early progress in deep learning was ""made possible by the advent of fast graphics processing units (GPUs) that were convenient to program and allowed researchers to train networks 10 or 20 times faster.""That's what Microsoft knew a couple of weeks ago when it asked Nvidia to provide the computing power for its HGX-1 hyperscale GPU accelerator, specifically for cloud-based artificial intelligence applications.Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huangadded of the new Microsoft/Nvidia venture:""AI is a new computing model that requires a new architecture. The HGX-1 hyperscale GPU accelerator will do for AI cloud computing what the ATX standard did to make PCs pervasive today. It will enable cloud-service providers to easily adopt NVIDIA GPUs to meet surging demand for AI computing.""ATX, short forAdvanced Technology-eXtended, is motherboard configuration that paved the way for the proliferation of PCs thereafter by standardizing how they would be assembled and what sort of hardware could be connected to them.The biggest leap forward since ATX was unveiled would be a game-changer indeed. With Tencent and Nvidia now taking another step down that road, Nvidia is emerging as a key player in a market few expected it to be in.The Core of Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Is at RiskNvidia's deep-learning technology is also part of its autonomous driving platform, though it remains to be seen exactly what its future looks like on that front.Bottom Line for Nvidia StockFor all intents and purposes, Nvidia stock is still mostly an investment in tech company that makes computer displays work. That's not apt to change anytime in the immediate future. Given time though, artificial intelligence is positioned to be a big piece of the company's revenue pie.

5 Stocks to Invest Your Tax Refund In;3/27/2017;"IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.If you're getting a tax refund from the IRS this year, you   might not want to rush out and spend it on a shopping spree.   Instead, using your tax refund to improve your financial security   might be the best reward you can give yourself. Wondering what to   buy? Sit back, settle in, and see why these five investments   could be the most profit-friendly moves to make with your   windfall.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');IMAGE SOURCE: MICROSOFT.Own a piece of a tech titanWhen Bill Gates startedMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) , he might've had an inkling that he was on to   something big, but it's hard to imagine he thought his new   company would make him one of the richest people in the   world.Microsoft has remained the undisputed champion of desktop and   laptop software for decades, but it's fast transitioning itself   into a next-generation powerhouse. Its popular Office software   (including Word, Excel, and PowerPoint) is being used by millions   of people online, which is driving significant growth in cloud   revenue. Server solutions that combine on- and off-premises   tools, the integration of LinkedIn, and of course, online gaming   via Xbox Live are all potential reasons why Microsoft could be a   rewarding stock to buy.Still unconvinced? Don't forget that Microsoft's dividend   yield is a healthy 2.4%.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Think globalGiven all the anti-trade talk during the U.S. presidential   campaign, it may seem counterintuitive to want to invest outside   America. However, now could be the perfect time to look beyond   America's borders to some of the world's fastest-growing   markets.Campaign rhetoric has fueled a big run-up in U.S. stock   markets. But foreign markets have moved up less, and because   they're out of favor, there may be bargains to buy -- especially   since regions like Asia continue to grow more quickly than the   United States. For example, China is aiming for 6.5% GDP growth   in 2017, and that's two to three times better than the outlook   for the U.S.If you're interested in this contrarian idea, consider   avoiding individual stocks, and buying theVanguard FTSE Emerging Markets ETF(NYSEMKT: VWO) . It's got a rock-bottom expense ratio of only   0.14%, and it owns over 4,200 companies. Currently, its biggest   bets are financials and technology, and 26% of its assets are   invested in China.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Drilling up dividendsIt's hard to imagine, but through all of the ups and downs of   the energy market,ExxonMobil(NYSE: XOM) has still boosted its dividend payout to investors in   each of the past 34 years. In each of the past three years, the   company has increased its dividend in the second quarter, so   another increase could be coming soon. Currently, shares yield   3.7%.Yes, oil andnatural   gas pricesremain well off their highs because of a glut caused by U.S.   shale production, but a lot of that production is profitable at   current prices. And even when it isn't profit-friendly,   ExxonMobil's refining, chemical, and retail businesses still help   insulate it from losses.Overall, if you're looking to invest your tax refund in a   dividend stock that can benefit from global economic growth,   ExxonMobil's tough to beat.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Bet big on AmericaIf you're convinced the U.S. is the place to be, then   investing your tax refund in theS&P 500might be your single best choice.The index is comprised of America's biggest and most   profitable companies, and because many of those companies pay   dividends, investors get rewarded with a steady stream of income.   Importantly, buying the S&P 500 gives you instant   diversification across the U.S. market, including financials,   healthcare, and energy, without you having to pick and choose   winners.Admittedly, the S&P 500 has had a big run-up since last   November, but buying the index has panned out over the long haul.   If your investment time horizon is measured in years, not days,   then consider theVanguard S&P 500 ETF(NYSEMKT: VOO) . Its expense ratio is an impressively low 0.05%,   and that means more of your refund gets put to work for you.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Baby-boomer benefitsShares in top-notch healthcare stocks haven't rallied as much   as other companies since the election because of fear over price   controls, but that could be creating a great opportunity to cozy   up to top stocks likeCelgene Corp.(NASDAQ: CELG) that benefit from rising demand tied to aging baby   boomers.Celgene is best known as a leader in treating blood cancer,   including multiple myeloma, but it's also having success   marketing medicine for other indications. For example, its Otezla   is one of the fastest-growing drugs used to treat psoriasis, a   common skin disease. Positive results in recent studies may mean   it has a drug on the market soon for multiple sclerosis, too.Management thinks sales can grow more than 50% and earnings   can nearly double by 2021.

3 Top Augmented Reality Stocks to Buy in 2017;3/24/2017;"The augmented reality (AR) market, which includes products   that project digital overlays atop real world images, is often   overshadowed by the virtual reality (VR) market. Yet tech M&A   advisory firm Digi-Capital still believes that the  AR   market will grow from nearly nothing today to $90 billion by   2020, compared to just $30 billion for the VR market.The firm believes that although the AR market will be   fragmented among products for various entertainment, enterprise,   and e-commerce purposes, it will reach more users than the VR   market, which will be primarily focused on gaming and video.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();There aren't many publicly traded ""pure plays"" on the AR   market today, but investors can take a closer look at three   companies that may benefit from its future growth --Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) ,Himax Technologies(NASDAQ: HIMX) , andApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) .The innovator: MicrosoftMicrosoft's biggest investment in the AR market is the   HoloLens, a ""mixed reality"" headset that projects digital images   onto real world surfaces. In previous demos, Microsoft showed   that the HoloLens could be used to play games likeMinecrafton coffee tables, enable retail customers to virtually test out   products that aren't in the store, and even ""teleport"" another   person  into the room via a holographic projection.The HoloLens isn't prepped for a commercial launch yet, but   Microsoft has alreadysold ""thousands""of $3,000 development kits to early adopters. The upcoming   Windows 10 Creators Update will also add 3D image capture and    editing tools to the OS, which will enable developers to   create 3D objects that can be viewed in the HoloLens. Microsoft's   upcoming VR headsets, which will be developed by hardware   partners, will also utilize similar voice and gesture commands as   the HoloLens -- so they could be considered ""training wheels"" for   the headsets.Image source: Microsoft.AR won't become a major revenue driver for Microsoft anytime   soon, but HoloLens and the Creators Update could eventually make   Windows a major platform for next-gen AR apps.The supplier: Himax TechnologiesHimax is a Taiwanese supplier of display drivers for monitors,   tablets, and smartphones. But in recent quarters, Himax has   aggressively expanded into ""non-driver"" components for AR, VR,   and 3D-sensing devices. In particular, Himax's LCOS (liquid   crystal on silicon) products use highly reflective liquid   crystals that either reflect or block light for clearer digital   images -- which make them ideal for AR and VR headsets.In 2016, Himax's non-driver revenues rose 23% annually and   accounted for 20% of its top line. That growth offset softer   sales of its display drivers for tablets and phones, and boosted   its full year revenues by 16%. However, analysts expect Himax's   revenue to fall 3% this year due to weaker seasonal demand for   display drivers and lower revenues from its AR/VR-related   businesses.Despite that hiccup, which was likely caused by AR/VR demand   coming in below market expectations, some analysts remain bullish   on Himax's long-term prospects in these next-gen markets. Nomura   Securities, Morgan Stanley, and Northland Securities all recently   upgraded the stock, citing the growth potential of its display   drivers among newer TVs and growing demand for LCOS products for   AR/VR devices. Many analysts also believe that Himax will provide   a 3D-sensing chip for this year's iPhone. Mizuho estimates that   the iPhone design win could  account for  5% of Himax's   2017 earnings and 15% of its 2018 earnings.The wild card: AppleThat brings us to the unlikely third pick, Apple. Apple   clearly needs to diversify its top line away from its core   iPhone, iPad, and Mac businesses, and many analysts have   speculated that the company's next big hardware product will be   an AR device.In addition to Himax's rumored 3D-sensing chip for the next   iPhone -- which could enable it to project AR overlays on   surfaces like the HoloLens -- Apple has aggressively expanded   into the AR space over the past few years. It acquired AR/VR   firms like Metaio, Faceshift, Emotient, and Flyby Media. It hired   leading experts like Doug Bowman, a former Virginia Tech computer   science professor who is regarded as one of the top VR experts in   the country. It filed several AR/VR patents which  depicted   an AR headset accessory for the iPhone, and reportedly assembled   a special team to handle  a secret AR/VR project.These movesall suggestthat Apple will enter the AR market in the same wayAlphabet's Google and Samsung entered the VR market -- by making the   smartphone the ""guts"" of cheaper headsets like the Google   Cardboard and Gear VR. However, creating a phone-based AR headset   could bemuchharder, since the user must clearly see the outside environment   via a camera. Regardless of what Apple's true plans are, the   company could soon surprise consumers and investors with a   next-gen AR device that boosts the market's mainstream appeal as   the iPod, iPhone, and iPad all did for their respective   markets.Take the long view...The AR market is still a young one, and it may or may not live   up to analyst expectations. Nobody expects AR tech to move the   needle for Microsoft, Himax, or Apple anytime soon, but it's a   fascinating adjacent market that could grow in importance over   the next few years.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Buy Some Downside to Own Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock at a Discount;3/24/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsInvestors have been hammered inAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) in more ways than one this week. But is it time to buy GOOGL stock's pullback? Let's take a look at what's behind the price action, the technical picture and a limited-risk options strategy on Alphabet to better navigate the environment.makeArticleAd();Source:Travis Wise via FlickrThe consensus view earlier this year had been anypolitical risksfacing Alphabet would surely be coming out of China or from Capitol Hill. But it was a problem from across the pond and from our European neighbors in the U.K. that sent shares of GOOGL tumbling this week.For the weekly period, shares of Alphabet are off about 4% after influential foreign ad buyers lashed out about how their ads had been placed alongside terrorist and other extremism media on Google's YouTube. For its part, Alphabet is taking action and looking to improve its""brand safety controls.""Improvements aren't happening soon enough for some though. Earlier this week, asBarron's noted,France'sHavas SA, the world's sixth largest marketing agency, stated it had pulled the plug on all client advertising in the U.K. from both YouTube and the Google Display Network.And now American companies are joining the ranks in protest as well.10 Clobbered Stocks to Buy That Are About to Get Red-HotIn the interim and while the controversy plays out withbullslike Pacific Crest and bears, or at leastalarmists, chiming in, we can take a visual look at how things are playing out in GOOGL stock.GOOGL Stock Daily ChartJust prior to this week's sudden and volatile bout of profit-taking, GOOGL stock had been making all the right technical moves. Since the beginning of 2017, shares of Alphabet managed to successfully clear the prior all-time highs, rally, establish a successful test of support and then proceed to even higher highs.Now - despite the quick drop of around 4% this week - our view is Alphabet could be setting up as a pullback entry. For the more quick-fingered among us, the hammering of shares by Thursday's close actually formed a bullish hammer low.The reversal pattern has some backing from an oversold stochastics condition and received price confirmation early Friday as GOOGL stock moved above the candlestick's high of $841.69.Is it perfect? No. There has been some distribution, the current setup is modestly below the well-watched 50-day simple moving average and trends do eventually end.Personally and given the mixed evidence, I'd rather look at entering into GOOGL stock if it were to trade down into a support zone from around $795 - $825. The potential area of support holds a couple retracement levels, the 200-day simple moving average and a second test of the prior highs, and amounts to a correction of up to 9% within the bigger picture's established uptrend.GOOGL Long Put ButterflyGiven my belief that the hammering may not be completely done in Alphabet, I like the idea of an atypical approach to positioning for downside and buying stock at lower levels.With GOOGL near $840, the April $835/$820/$805 is priced for $2.20 or better. The bearishly targeted butterfly achieves its maximum profit of $12.80 if shares fall 2.5% to $820 on expiration. More achievable, the limited risk spread maintains a profit range from $807.20 to $832.80 and prior to that third Friday, gains can even be realized outside the targeted price zone.Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock Has a Powerful New WeaponIf GOOGL stock actually begins to rally in a material way, I would personally look to cut risk using a money stop of 50%, or $1.10. While the initial debit is small, holding on and remaining on the wrong side of price action in a name the trader ultimately wants to own at lower prices doesn't make sense.Were shares of Alphabet to fall below $805, the trader will be out the full debit. However, if the end game is buying GOOGL on weakness as it enters the support zone, knowing the most you'd pay for the stock is $807.20 and possibly a lot less, is worth considering.Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in any of the securities or their derivatives mentioned in this article.

Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock Has a Powerful New Weapon;3/24/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFor the better part of 2016, the bulk of investor concern surroundingMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) was its budding cloud-computing war withAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN). While both were in the cloud business before last year started, the race didn't heat up in earnest until around this time last year, and MSFT stock has benefited as investors see the old tech goliath show some teeth.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockNow, the initial dust is settling, both companies have formed a line and moved on to other fronts. As such, the key narrative for 2017 is going to be a slightly different one.Rather than being pushed and pulled by Amazon-driven headlines, MSFT stock holders will want to keep an eye on the newly gelled offensive againstsalesforce.com, inc.(NYSE:CRM), and to a less degree,Oracle Corporation(NYSE:ORCL).Microsoft's unexpected ally in that fight?Adobe Systems Incorporated(NASDAQ:ADBE).Salesforce.com Fires the First VolleyThe battlefield is artificial intelligence.It's not a new venture by any means. Amazon has Alexa, and Microsoft built Cortana. But this isn't the kind of tool that helps you look up phone numbers and set reminders. Salesforce built developed this one with a specific purpose: to help its customer-management customers get more sales out of their data.10 Safe Dividend Stocks to Own During the Next Market CrashIt's called Einstein, and appropriately so. DA Davidson analyst Jack Andrewsexplained after reviewing the Einstein platform earlier this month:""CRM believes Einstein furthers its vision of achieving a single customer view, with specific use cases around predictive marketing, assisted service, guided sales, unified commerce, actionable analytics, etc.""It's the first practical, game-changing artificial intelligence tool out there that serves a viable commercial purpose.To be fair, Watson fromInternational Business Machines Corp.(NYSE:IBM) was the first and is still arguably the most meaningful of all artificial intelligence platforms out there,taking aim at cancer,anddoing taxes. Cost-wise, it's not a practical possibility for most business, but for those bigger companies that can pony it up, Einstein and Watson play nice together.It's a market most owners of MSFT stock think Microsoft should be in.Well,it is.The Microsoft-Adobe PartnershipMicrosoft and Adobe just announced they'veintegrated Adobe Campaign and Microsoft Dynamics 365, allowing users of both to assemble data and make business decisions in an effective way that wasn't possible when each platform was on its own.This deal has been in the works for a while; it just came to fruition within the past few days. A joint statement from the duo explained:""Bringing together Adobe's and Microsoft's sales, marketing and customer intelligence solutions enables brands to better understand and engage with their customers across all touch points.""The partnership also adds Microsoft'sPower BItool toAdobe Analytics, providing detailed visualizations of how well a marketing campaign performed, and how they can be improved.Realistically speaking, the partnership's offer doesn't seem like it's as potent as Salesforce.com's Einstein is -yet.It's also a relatively new venture, and in time, could prove to be a headwind for the customer-management company. MSFT could also leverage its existing cloud-based services like Office and Azure, further integrating them with ADBE's tools to become a one-stop solution.It might not be an AI in the traditional sense, but functionality is more important than a trendy categorization of tools.How Much Will Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Fall If the iPhone 8 Flops?In other words, Microsoft stock isn't exactly shooting blanks here.Bottom Line for MSFT StockAs was the case with the advent of cloud computing (in the broad sense), where nobody really knew where Amazon.com and Microsoft would draw their dividing line, nobody really knows where Adobe and Microsoft will be able to stop the advance from Salesforce. This is all a work in progress.There's little doubt as to this being one of the hot buttons MSFT stock owners need to keep close tabs on though, as the resulting headlines of this war will establish one side as the winner and the other as a loser. Pay close attention to the rhetoric, because it will matter.That being said, Microsoft (with Adobe) is the arguable favorite here, simply because it has a deeper bench and deeper pockets.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceBank of America Corp (BAC) Stock Is a Stink-Free BuyCount Out Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

CSRA Stock Gains on Navy Contract Win Worth $39 Million;3/24/2017;"Shares ofCSRA Inc.CSRAgained more than 1.5% on Mar 23, after the company announced a contract win from the Department of Navy worth $39 million. The original contract dates back to 2009 and the renewal will enable the company to continue its support to effectively manage Navy Public Affairs.makeArticleAd();CSRA is the largest pure play government IT service provider. Almost 90% of the company's revenues come from sales to the U.S. federal government either as a prime contractor or subcontractor. The renewal reflects growing preference for the company's IT services by federal departments.Frequent Contract Wins Boost Book-to-BillWe note that CSRA's deep domain knowledge and expertise in next-generation IT services is helping it to win new contracts on a frequent basis. At the end of third-quarter fiscal 2017, the backlog of signed business orders was $15.8 billion, of which $2.7 billion was funded.CSRA Inc. Revenue (TTM)CSRA Inc. Revenue (TTM)|CSRA Inc. QuoteTotal backlog increased 3% from the year-ago quarter. Bookings totaled $1.9 billion in the reported quarter, representing a book-to-bill ratio of 1.5 times. Moreover, 73% of bookings in the quarter were for new business, while the win rate on new business was 46%, well above management's target of 25%.So far in this fiscal, the company has won $3.1 billion in new business, ahead of its target run-rate of $4 billion each year.Inconsistent Revenues Hurting GrowthDespite winning frequent contracts, CSRA's revenue growth has been inconsistent since it started trading as a standalone company. Since Nov 30, 2015, we note that shares have declined 6.8% as compared with the ZacksIT Servicesindustry's increase of 10.8%.The projections are also not optimistic for the upcoming quarters. CSRA expects industry book-to-bills for the fourth quarter to be a bit dampened by the ongoing transition in the Trump administration.Moreover, slow ramping of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) background investigations contract and the large Army C4ISR program is anticipated to impact the quarter. These programs will take some time to generate meaningful revenues (especially the OPM contract) which will impact top-line growth in the near term.Strategic Partnerships Key CatalystCSRA's collaborations with strategic partners like Amazon Web Services (AWS), OracleORCL, CiscoCSCO, MicrosoftMSFT, salesforce, SAP and ServiceNow is a key catalyst in our view.The partnerships not only help the company in jointly developing differentiating solutions (like the application with Oracle Exadata that helped in winning the HIGLAS contract) but also bid for complex contracts like Greenway. We believe that these partnerships will help the company win new contracts more regularly.Currently, CSRA carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

AR is one of the many fields under consideration.

The company has also acquired several smaller firms with expertise in AR hardware, 3D gaming and virtual reality software.The market presents significant growth opportunity for Apple despite competition from AlphabetGOOGL, Microsoft and Facebook. According to Bloomberg, which quoted Global Market Insights figures, the global market for AR products will surge 80% to $165 billion by 2024.

Is India the Next Big Market for Apple's (AAPL) iPhones?;3/24/2017;"Indians will soon seeApple Inc.'sAAPLiPhone 6 and 6S models packaged with a tag line of 'Assembled in India'. Yes, it's true.PerThe Wall Street Journal, the company's Taiwanese supplier - Wistron - is likely to start making the aforesaid models in the next four to six weeks at its manufacturing facility in Bengaluru, India. It should be noted that Wistron, in late Dec 2016, sought permission for expansion of its manufacturing facility from the Indian government.Though, Apple's shares were down 0.4% yesterday, it has gained 21.6% so far this year. Notably, the stock's year-to-date return is almost in line with the Zacks categorizedComputer-Miniindustry's gain of 21.5%.Why is Apple Highly Focused on India?Since 2016, Apple has been increasing its focus on India to claim a greater share of the vast smartphone market in the country, of which it reportedly holds only 2% as of now. Apple has been facing a slowdown in iPhone demand in most regions, either because of stiff competition or regulatory hurdles (China) or market saturation (the U.S). Thus, it makes sense for the company to solidify/fortify its position in India, which is projected to become the second largest smartphone market in the world.Notably, in fiscal 2016, Apple sales in India surged approximately 50% over the prior fiscal. Moreover, during its last quarterly earnings conference call, the company revealed that its smartphone sales in the country registered 51% year-over-year growth in the first three quarters of fiscal 2017.Apple, of course, is not the only tech player eyeing India for growth. Given the potential of this market, Silicon Valley's interest is well understood. From Microsoft Corp.MSFTto AlphabetGOOGL, to Facebook Inc.FB, all remain laser focused on the Indian market.Furthermore, a younger and skilled population, along with increasing investment in broadband network by the government, makes India an attractive growth opportunity for Apple over the long run. In fact, the Indian government, under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, is eager to bring foreign capital and boost manufacturing facilities in the country.The recently outlined FDI policy by Indian government also bodes well for the company as it eliminates the requirement to locally source products for at least a three-year period. This will enable Apple to open its solely-owned retail stores in India. Thereafter, the company will have to comply with the rule. In addition, company has partnered with telecom company - Reliance - which is providing its Jio (a unique all-IP network) service for free with the new iPhones.Last year, Tim Cook was on a charm offensive in India. Besides meeting Modi, he also announced the opening of an iOS App Design and Development Accelerator in Bengaluru, as well as a map development office in another Indian city - Hyderabad - in collaboration with regional firm RMSI. He was also seen hobnobbing with industrialists and movie stars during his maiden visit to the country.Will the Move Aid Apple's Cause?Per analysts, the lion's share of Apple's revenues in the country comes from devices, which are a couple of generations old. Newer models have relatively low demand given the hefty price tag. According to reports, the Apple team in India is trying to increase revenues to $3 billion by fiscal 2017-18. Also, by local assembling operations, the company can start operating its own retail outlets and avail a 10% tax benefit. This, in turn, is likely to lower prices.However, a Forbes analyst observes that even if Apple starts production locally, the prices might not come down as much. This is because, at present, only assembling operations can be carried out in India as the country lacks a robust supply chain like China. Furthermore, the analyst argues that though labor cost in the country is cheaper than China, productivity is relatively better in China. Simple assembling may not drastically bring down prices. However, if India can ""spark"" a creation of local supply chain like China, then it will be a big positive.Moreover, another analyst observes that Apple's lack of focus on regional customers' demand is a pressing concern. India is categorized by handsets that work on dual SIMs. Apparently, Apple is not keen on making dual SIM handsets. This could be a very big impediment to growth in the country. The iPhone manufacturer is already late to the party. Its rival Samsung has long been in the market, and with reportedly 23% share, it is currently the leading player in the country.Bottom LineDespite Modi's historic move of demonetizing Rs 500 and Rs 1000 currency notes to combat corruption, the company registered all-time record revenue figures in third-quarter fiscal 2017, while its various competitors were hurt by the same. In our opinion, this shows Indians' immense love for Apple's products.However, the company lags behind its competitors on the pricing front. We believe that the latest move will allow Apple evade import duty tariffs. This will enable it to price its smartphones more competitively.Furthermore, by manufacturing iPhone models in India, Apple will be able to capture considerable market share in one of the world's fastest growing economy, where it has a meager presence when compared with other rivals such as Samsung, Micromax etc.Despite the pros and cons, Apple is expected to continue its expansion drive in India. The company will be taking up a lot more initiatives this year. However, whether those initiatives yield desirable results remains a wait and watch story.Currently, Apple carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Revenue Growth is No SNAP for TWTR;3/23/2017;"makeZacksArticleAd();Snap Inc(SNAP) recently has seen new coverage from a few brokerages and today is the first day that is has a Zacks Rank.  The stock started off like a lot of recent IPO's with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Yesterday I wrote an article about the pending flood of research we can expect on the recent IPO.  In that article I discussed who will initiate coverage, who has already started coverage and some recent target prices placed on the stock.  I also guess at potential target prices from the lead in the IPO.A Prime ComparisonAs I try to wrap my head around SNAP, I want to look at a good comparison.Twitter(TWTR) was once a social media darling - an technically it probably still is, but the stock is anything but.CEO and other management issues including a massive brain drain have left the company in a tight spot.  I know that the CEO Jack Dorsey and new Chairman of the Board Omid Kordestani deserve some time to get things rolling, but the outlook just isn't that good.Going For GrowthI am a growth guy and I want to see revenues expanding so much that even Mr. Wonderful himself Kevin O'Leary would blush.  SNAP has those sorts of numbers and I will review that idea later in another article, but a major competitor just doesn't have it.Take a look at this chart of the revenues and expected revenues for Twitter:Do you see what I see?  Year over year revenue DECREASES for the next three quarters.  After all those declines, what will they do in the fourth quarter of this year?  Well it is an increase, but not much of one… 1%.Portfolio Manager's ViewImagine you are the growth portfolio manager at some mega fund.  I know you are on the hunt constantly for stocks that will post big revenue increases and you have to know that SNAP is at least going to be showing some solid growth when it comes out of the gate.One of the stocks that might have been competing for investment dollars is Twitter, but after looking at the above chart, are you the person that wants TWTR over SNAP?  I didn't think so.What About The Book?It wouldn't be fair to TWTR to just say that SNAP is in there taking away its revenue.  I mean there is another big social media stock out that that seems to be getting a lot of investor attention, right?Facebook(FB) is a monster and has seen revenue growth accelerate in 2016 comparted to 2015.  Most projections call for some deceleration on the topline, but some of these numbers are just astonishing:My ViewRevenue growth to me is key and as long as it is not present inTwitter(TWTR) I am not really interested in their stock.Facebook(FB) on the other hand has plenty of revenue growth.  We will get some big numbers next week for what Wall Street is looking for from SNAP.

Twitter (TWTR) Suspends Thousands of Terrorist Accounts;3/23/2017;"Twitter Inc.TWTRhas taken a strong step to counter terrorism by flagging accounts linked with terrorism on its platform. According to Twitter's latest bi-annual transparency report, the company has banned 636,248 accounts on grounds of violent extremism between Aug 2015 and Dec 2016.The company announced that out of the 636,248 accounts suspended so far, 376,890 accounts linked with terrorism are pulled down between Jul 2016 and Dec 2016. Consequently, this move raised the daily suspension rate by 80% compared with the last year.Moreover, 74% of these accounts were identified by the internal spam fighting tools of the company. One-third of the blocked accounts were automatically detected by these spam fighting tools as there is no specific algorithm to detect the terrorist related accounts.Twitter's proactive stance in eliminating terrorist activities on its platform will surely boost its brand value, which will attract advertisers eventually driving up top-line growth.Twitter, Inc.

International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) Stock Has More Room to Grow;3/23/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsInternational Business Machines Corp.(NYSE:IBM) has never been the first company the IT community thinks about when it comes to cloud computing. Its market position lags the better-known ""computing-as-a-service"" platform fromAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN),Alphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) andMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT). That's all right: At maybe $3 billion, pure cloud services don't even drive 4% of the venerable company's annual top line.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockBut the transition from physical corporate data to cloud ""available anywhere"" approaches is enough of a game-changing story that IBM stock's fourth-place finish becomes extremely interesting to investors.And as the hoopla around a recent note from Morgan Stanley reveals, it doesn't take more than a toehold in a fast-growing market to move the needle on an otherwise mature stock.Sure, AMZN might have 40% of the global cloud business sewn up right now, versus at best 6% to 8% for IBM. AMZN grabbed the early opportunity and is reaping the rewards. However, the game now is all about bigger and more recalcitrant enterprise data pools shifting to cloud environments, and that's where the real long-term money is going to come from.Why IBM Stock Can Do Well Wtih the CloudAmazon's cloud business is growing fast, but its share of the overall market has plateaued. IBM stock has more room to come up from behind as it leveragesFortune500 relationships into more lucrative contracts.10 Small-Cap Stocks That Could Double in the Next 3 MonthsSo while AMZN is directly cannibalizing traditional premise-based computing relationships that once belonged to companies likeOracle Corporation(NYSE:ORCL)EMC Corporation(NYSE:EMC) orHewlett Packard Enterprise Co(NYSE:HPE), IBM is doing what it always does: Transforming the entire data ecosystem in order to keep the money coming in.It's not so much about an immediate return on investment here for customers as it's opening up new strategic capabilities that tie into IBM's artificial intelligence and advanced infrastructure. Once you graduate to the AMZN cloud, you can migrate around the cloud universe to find the vendors that work best; once you tie in with IBM, you're there for life.And as Morgan Stanley's analysts rightly pointed out, that premise is almost entirely discounted in IBM stock's share price. Too few investors take the dark horse seriously, crowding instead into AMZN where the cloud story seems more or less baked in - it would take pretty amazing news for this piece of the company to budge the stratospheric stock price much from here.At minimum, MS thinks IBM's cloud is worth another $35 per share. We might argue a little about the specific numbers, but it's not bad to be in fourth place at the moment. The company doesn't even have to try harder. It's just that there's still value for investors to buy IBM stock now and be rewarded down the road. Strip away all the high-tech jargon and that's the classic market opportunity: buy your diamonds when the rest of Wall Street is chasing shinier rocks.Hilary Kramer is the editor ofGameChangers,Breakout Stocks Under $10,High Octane Trader,Absolute Capital ReturnandValue Authority.

Frontier Communications Corp (FTR): This 20% Yield Will Vanish (FTR);3/23/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsShares of troubled telecomFrontier Communications Corp(NASDAQ:FTR) are continuing to crash today, with FTR stock off another 5% in the wake of a Wednesday downgrade.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockFor those of you keeping track, that's a nearly 60% loss over the past year or so of trading, putting FTR stock around the $2 per share range. On the upside, that has driven Frontier's yield up to more than 20%.Best of luck if you go speculating on that.Specifically, Goldman's Brett Feldman warned that Frontier may opt to suspend its dividend after the first quarter of this year for liquidity purposes, as the company has significant debt maturities coming in 2020 through 2022. He continues:""With the stock's dividend yield nearly 2x peers', we believe the market is pricing in a 50% cut. We do not view this as sufficient to drive long-term delevering and have removed the dividend from our model after 1Q17.""In other words, Frontier might cut the dividend in half, which if it does, would still mean a dividend yield of about 10% for FTR stock at current prices. In fact, you can bet that yield will tick up even more, because a dividend cut will almost surely spark additional selling.10 Safe Dividend Stocks to Own During the Next Market CrashFeldman's warning came amid a downgrade of other regionals, includingWindstream Holdings, Inc.(NASDAQ:WIN) andCenturylink Inc(NYSE:CTL). The trio all received ""sell"" ratings. However, while all three have been suffering - WIN and CTL are down more than 20% in the past year - none are doing worse than Connecticut-based Frontier.To its credit, Frontier has been growing its top line like a weed, from $4.76 billion in 2013 and $4.77 billion in 2014 to $5.6 billion in 2015 and $8.9 billion last year. However, income has been steadily dropping thanks to increased expenses - while the company was soundly profitable in 2013 and '14, it flipped to a $319 million loss in 2015 that ballooned to nearly $600 million last year.FTR's cash position has been nearly halved since last year, and sits at just $522 million - a pittance compared to nearly $18 billion of total debt, which is more than double what it carried just three years ago.Buy Tesla Stock, Just Not for the CarsWhile cash flow has been enough to cover the dividend, those debts are mounting and need addressed. Back in November, Thomas Byrne of Wealth Strategies & Management instead suggested the bonds for protection against a dividend cut:""The bonds give you three-quarters of the yield of the equity, less duration risk and a higher place on the capital structure. If FTR runs into financial difficulties, down the road, dividends would be sacrificed to pay the debt.""The S&P 500 has already dropped Frontier from its ranks. For now, FTR is nothing more than a speculative play - a gamble on whether the company can do enough financial shenanigans to pay nearly 20% in dividends without the stock plummeting even further.As of this writing, Robert Martin did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace5 Dividend Stocks Increasing Payouts -- O ORCL DG WSM TWOWhy Microsoft Corporations's Dividend Payments Could Double Within 5 Years (MSFT)7 High-Yield Dividend Stocks That Are Actually SafeThe postFrontier Communications Corp (FTR): This 20% Yield Will Vanish (FTR)appeared first onInvestorPlace."

3 Big Stock Charts for Thursday: Mylan N.V. (MYL), Campbell Soup Company (CPB) and Microsoft Corporation (MSFT);3/23/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsHeadline news is causing traders to check the charts ofMylan N.V.(NASDAQ:MYL) and Campbell Soup Company (NYSE:CPB) as the bears look to potentially take these stocks lower. At the same time, traders are maintaining the consistent, low volatility bullish trend inMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT), as the stock continues to consolidate just below $66 in preparation for what may be the next step higher in the software giant's strong recovery.makeArticleAd();Mylan N.V. (MYL)News that Mylan would be recalling 81,000 Epipens on report of their failure caused shares prices to slump in the pre-market trading. After the open though, MYL shares are higher as the stock prepares to test technical support.Mylan shares have been declining almost each day in March as uncertainty over health care changes and their effect on drug price coverage has caused investors to take profits after the stock rallied for the first two months of the year.The decline resulted in MYL shares approaching their 200-day moving average, currently at $41.02, just $0.10 lower than today's lows.The 7 Best Low-Risk Healthcare Stocks to BuyMylan stock will likely gain mild support from the longer-term moving average, which is transitioning into a slight uptrend. That aside, more serious and stronger support is slightly lower on the price scale.MYL's 50-day trendline currently sits at $40.50 and from our estimates it is likely to be the trendline that helps Mylan reverse its recent selling. The trendline is in a bullish pattern, suggesting more strength for support. In addition, MYL shares will have hit an oversold reading at this point, adding to the potential for a tradable move higher. Bulls should be setting their targets for $40.50 on Mylan.Microsoft Corporation (MSFT)Microsoft shares continue their low volatility march higher to take even more of a relative strength leadership role in the market.MSFT has been on the rise since its last earnings report, which surprised bearishly postured investors. We've continued to see signs that the market is moving into Microsoft shares on the slightest declines, building the continued rally.MSFT stock has spent the last month consolidating around $65, making a short run at $66. The consolidation has allowed for Microsoft shares to begin to use their 50-day moving average, which is in a bullish trend, to ratchet higher.There are indications that the lackluster movement in Microsoft stock may shift into a volatility rally as the stock breaks above $66, which would potentially move MSFT shares above the top Bollinger Band.For now, we expect the stock to continue to lie and wait for the next broad market rally that is likely to trigger a rally to the $70-level for Microsoft shares.Campbell Soup Company (CPB)Campbell Soup announced a $1.5 billion stock buyback program this morning, something that reminds us of the quirky little tricks that often get used by companies when trying to stretch earnings news.CPB stock sold-off after its last earnings report and broke through all three critical support trendlines since. Now shares of Campbell Soup are threatening two critical moves.Why Lululemon Athletica Inc. (LULU) Shouldn't Buy Under Armour Inc (UAA)First, a break back below $57, which would take CPB stock below an obvious chart support level that tracks back to 2016.Second, the stock's 50-day moving average has completed a transition into a bearish trend, increasing the odds that Campbell Soup's stock will see a decline each day by more than 50%.  In other words, the trend is no longer a friend of CPB stock owners.Watch for a move to $53 on the break back below $57 over the intermediate-term outlook.As of this writing, Johnson Research Group did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 Small-Cap Stocks That Could Double in the Next 3 Months10 Monthly Dividend Stocks to Buy to Pay the BillsThe post3 Big Stock Charts for Thursday: Mylan N.V.

IBM Partners DCU on Water Management Using IoT Platform;3/23/2017;"International Business Machines CorporationIBMand Dublin City University (DCU) Water Institute have announced a collaborative research pilot to make use of various Internet of Things (IoT) technologies for environmental management and monitoring.More specifically, sensors developed by DCU will be integrated with IBM's cognitive IoT and machine learning technologies to conserve and protect natural resources and address issues pertaining to environmental. One such application will be water quality monitoring for both marine and freshwater environments.Initially, the sensors will be deployed on Lake George in New York State. Later on, IBM and DCU Water Institute will selectively pilot these technologies in the U.S. and Ireland.Notably, shares of IBM gained 0.52% on Wednesday. The stock has outperformed the ZacksComputer - Integrated Systemsindustry on a year-to-date basis. While the industry gained only 3.5% during the period, the stock appreciated 5.3%The outperformance of the stock could be attributed to growing adoption of the IBM Watson IoT platform as a well as an expanding portfolio that is boosting its top line.What it Means for IBM?As per a MarketsandMarkets report, smart water management market is projected to reach a whopping $20.10 billion by 2021 at a CAGR of 18.9%.Competition is stiff with the presence of major players such as Veolia Environment, Suez Environment, ITT Corporation and Utilities and Severn Trent.We believe that IBM's collaboration with DCU Water Institute will position the company better as it focuses on lowering the costs of sensor technologies compared to commercial technologies available in the market. This will pave the way for greater adoption.International Business Machines Corporation Price and     ConsensusInternational Business Machines Corporation Price   and Consensus|International Business Machines Corporation QuoteMoreover, as per an IDC report, the IoT market is estimated to reach a stellar 1.7 trillion by 2020.

Infosys has Room to Grow Despite Visa Scare: Here's Why;3/23/2017;"The unexpected victory of Donald Trump in the 58th quadrennial presidential election had sent the Indian IT industry into panic mode, with frontrunners dreading Trump's stance on anti-immigration policies. Expectedly, Indian IT behemothInfosys Limited'sINFYheavy dependence on the H-1B visa program made it particularly vulnerable to any sudden policy change.However, despite the high octane political drama surrounding the visa program, Infosys' shares have appreciated a strong 6.1% in the past three months, better than the Zacks categorizedIT Servicesindustry's average return of 4.5%. The impressive beat in Infosys' third-quarter fiscal 2017 results (released in January) reinstated investors' confidence in the stock.Here are a few reasons why we still believe the stock has ample growth potential.The Growth DriversInfosys has been diligently following the ""Renew New"" program to boost growth. Two of its strategies-Zero Distance Program and improving next-generation services with AiKiDo (Artificial Intelligence, Knowledge-based IT and Design thinking) offerings-have proved major growth drivers in recent times. Overall, the Renew New strategy has helped the company reap multiple benefits, including renewal of traditional services, successful introduction of new ones and winning of deals.During the fiscal third quarter, the company added 77 clients with two being in the above-75 million revenue brackets. Solid performance across all its platforms - Finacle, Edge Verve, and Panay - proved conducive to growth. This apart, Infosys' collaboration with leading technology providers like Microsoft CorporationMSFTand Amazon.com, Inc.AMZNis expected to offer a competitive edge over peers.H-1B Visa Worries ExaggeratedThe Trump administration has drafted an executive order to make changes in the H-1B program but none of them have materialized so far. According to Stephen Miller, an advisor of Donald Trump, immigration will remain a ""merit-based system"", where deserving candidates can gain entry. It is safe to say that a complete repeal of the program will cause more harm to the U.S. economy and is unlikely to occur.Meanwhile, leading banks, the key customers of companies like Infosys and Wipro LimitedWIT, are likely to boost their spendings if Trump delivers on his promise to slash corporate taxes and loosen other regulations. This bodes well for Infosys and its peers. To make the most of the situation, Infosys has decided to stop junior employees from applying for H-1B visas. The lengthy legislative process that accompanies such major changes will give Infosys ample time to adjust to the changes, if and when they happen.Impressive FundamentalsInfosys has missed earnings only once in the trailing four quarters. During the last reported quarter, the company's earnings per American Depository Share came in at 24 cents, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny and up 4.3% on a year-over-year basis. The bottom line benefited from a modest top-line performance and diligent operational execution. Also, the company holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which implies that it is expected to outperform the broader market in the next few months. You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.In addition, Infosys also has a Zacks VGM score of 'A'. Our VGM Score identifies stocks that have the most attractive value, growth and momentum characteristics. A good VGM score indicates stronger chances of success. Our research shows that stocks with Style Scores of 'A' or 'B,' when combined with Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best upside potential.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the   iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

The Future of Virtual Reality: 5 Things to Know;3/22/2017;"Virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) technologies   have gotten a lot of attention over the past few years.Sony's PlayStation VR headset is shining a spotlight onthe viability of VR gaming, whileAlphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL)  Google Cardboard and new   Daydream View headsets are pushing mobile VR into the mainstream.   The unexpected success of Pokemon Go last year showed that   smartphone users are ready and willing to adopt augmented   reality. AndMicrosoft's(NASDAQ: MSFT)  development of its HoloLens goggles aim to   prove that the virtual and augmented worlds will soon become a   part of our reality.Investors looking to benefit from these two intertwined   markets should keep these five things in mind:Image source: Google.makeArticleAd();1. The future of VR could be our next computing     platformMuch of the attention surrounding virtual reality right now   has to do mainly with how it will be used for gaming, filmmaking,   or other entertainment content. ButFacebook(NASDAQ: FB) CEO Mark Zuckerberg believes that VR could surpass   all of these categories.He said in a Bloomberginterviewlast year that VR is ""a good candidate to be the next major   computing platform."" Zuckerberg thinks it'll take a while for us   to get there (more on that later), but he's optimistic that VR   could be a primary form of communication technology in the near   future:Photos are richer than text; video, much richer than photos.     But that's not the end, right? I mean, it's like this     indefinite continuum of getting closer and closer to being able     to capture what a person's natural experience and thought is,     and just being able to immediately capture that and design it     however you want and share it with whomever you want.2. It will take a while for VR to gain     tractionVR is still in its very early stages, and it's likely that it   will take many more years before it becomes mainstream --   Zuckerberg has put the timeframe at five to 10 years.Adding to the slow pace is the fact that some hyped   technologies, like Magic Leap's AR headset, have recently been   found to be behind schedule.The Informationreported(subscription required) at the end of the last year that Magic   Leap -- which has raised $1.4 billion in funding in about three   years -- pivoted away from some of its earlier fiber optic   technologies and now trails the image quality of Microsoft's   HoloLens.And even the HoloLens, which currently costs $3,000 and is   mainly for developers, has sold only thousands of units. Roger   Walkden, Microsoft's HoloLens commercial lead,recently toldThe Inquirerthat, ""We're not trying to sell hundreds of thousands or millions   or anything, it's expensive, and it's not in huge numbers. So   we're happy with the level of sales that we've got -- I can't   tell you anything about the numbers, but it's in thousands, not   hundreds of thousands, and that's fine. That's all we need.""While Microsoft may be pleased with those numbers, it's still   a clear indicator that VR and AR have a long way go before they   become mainstream.And then there's the recent news that Facebook's Oculus is   shutting down 200 of its 500 demo sites within Best Buy   stores, reportedly due to thelack of public interest. The future may be virtual, but we're getting there slowly.3. It offers a new way of seeing our worldJason Pontin, the editor of MIT'sTechnology Review,recentlyinterviewedJessica Brillhart, a filmmaker for virtual reality at   Google, and talked with her about how VR is currently used and   what it might become in the near future. When asked if   people will eventually use VR to record home videos, Brillhart   responded that we probably would but that it might not be a good   thing,Think of everything you forget about a birthday party when     you're a kid. But now the rig would capture everything. You     could watch someone you loved respond the way she used to, or     eat cake a certain way. It is going to be interesting to see     what happens when we aren't able to forget anything     anymore.The interview is a good reminder that VR is still in its early   stages and it's still unclear how this platform will be used, and   whether or not we'll like exactly how it turns out.4. Virtual reality could eventually impact all of the     sensesRight now, VR is limited to a user's visual and auditory   senses, but in the future this will likely be enhanced.   The general manager of Dell's gaming PC manufacturer   Alienware, Frank Azor, said thisin an interviewwith TIME last year:Once you begin catering to the rest of the senses, like what     we feel body-wise, temperature-wise, and smell, the reality     factor of virtual reality [becomes] stronger and the virtual     piece begins to fade.Breaking the barrier between the virtual world and the   physical world with high-end touch sensors could be the next step   in virtual reality, and it won't be here for a while, but VR   hardware and software makers are already thinking about how this   technology can go from immersive to fully interactive.5. The market potential for both AR and VR could be     hugeThe virtual reality market was worth about $1.9 billion in   2016, but that's expected to climb to $22.4 billion by 2020.   Those numbers include both software and hardware sales. And when   you factor in AR sales, the market skyrockets even higher. The   combined AR and VR market will be worth $121 billion by 2021,   according to Digi-Capital.In that same year, IDC estimates more than 99 million AR and   VR headsets will be shipped, up from just 10 million last year,   which represents a 58% compound annual growth rate between 2016   and 2021..The good news for investors is that companies are just getting   started with AR and VR, which meansthe opportunities to benefit haven't passed. There are still plenty of unknowns, but as more companies rally   around these new technologies and make the necessary investments   to get them off of the ground, we're likely to see the future of   AR and VR develop substantially over the next few years.10 stocks we like better than FacebookWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Oracle Launches Retail Merchandising Solution Over the Cloud;3/22/2017;"Oracle CorporationORCLhas recently announced the availability of its Oracle Retail Merchandising Solutions over its cloud platform - Oracle Cloud.The offerings are targeted at helping the retailers drive growth through optimizing mobility, improving customer engagement and enhancing user experience, thereby paving the way for a scalable and flexible business environment.However, the announcement failed to cheer the investors and the stock declined 0.86% on Tuesday.We note that, shares of Oracle have underperformed the Zacks Computer - Software industry over the last one year. While the industry gained 21.1%, the stock increased only 8.4%.The underperformance of the stock could be attributed to the short-term headwinds resulting from the transition to the cloud from its on-premise licensing business model. However, the company's prospects seem to be looking up and we expect the stock to rebound in the rest of 2017.Oracle Gaining Traction in SaaSDuring the last reported quarter, Oracle's top-line growth benefited from the ongoing cloud-based momentum. Total cloud revenues (13.6% of total revenue) soared 70.7% to $1.26 billion in the reported quarter.Cloud software-as-a-service (SaaS) and platform-as-a-service (PaaS) revenues increased a significant 84.6% year over year to $1.08 billion, which was within the management's guided range of 82-86%.Oracle Corporation Revenue (TTM)Oracle Corporation Revenue (TTM)|Oracle Corporation QuoteOracle continues to gain traction on its cloud endeavors. Specifically, the company's offerings in SaaS and PaaS have gained significant momentum in the past few quarters, which improves its competitive position.The company is gradually shifting its focus on a subscription-based business model from its earlier licensing based business model. This is because it offers the scope to have a recurring revenue stream which augurs well for the company in the long run.Per an IDC report, the SaaS market is expected to surge over $112.8 billion by 2019, which is currently growing at a CAGR of 18.3%. Given the gargantuan growth prospects the sector has to offer, competition is intensifying.Currently, the enterprise SaaS landscape is being dominated by salesforce.comCRM, followed by MicrosoftMSFT, AdobeADBEand SAP SE.

Why the Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock Comeback Is Just Beginning;3/21/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) has gotten some of its moxie back. Granted, the growth is nowhere near the pace of the glory years of the 1980s and 1990s. But then again, the shareholder returns have been impressive. During the last 5 years, Microsoft stock has logged a gain of nearly 100%. By comparison,International Business Machines Corp.(NYSE:IBM) has a loss of 13% andQualcomm, Inc.(NASDAQ:QCOM) lost about 11%.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockBut it does seem like the opportunity may be mostly gone for Microsoft stock. Let's face it, the valuation is far from cheap.Consider that the price-to-earnings ratio is about 30X and MSFT stock is near an all-time high. Yet, I think there remains more upside. The fact is that Microsoft stock is a great way to play the cloud megatrend, which is likely to see growth for many years.Why MSFT Stock Is a Good BetThis technology has many benefits that are just too critical to ignore, such as the ability for real-time analytics, better integration with other systems and seamless updates. The business model is also fairly predictable, since it is based on ongoing subscriptions.According toAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Cloud Chief Diane Greene, only about5% of the world's data is in the cloud. She thinks that ultimately the market could hit a stunning $1 trillion.7 Small-Cap Tech Stocks on the Cutting EdgeBut there is another important driver: In today's world, just about all companies need a strong digital presence to be successful. Simply put, customers have come to expect that they should go to a site or app - and quickly get what they want.So to provide this service, companies will need to rely on cloud services. And for now, the two main players include MSFT andAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN).But Microsoft stock may be in the best position. The company has a trusted global brand, a massive global infrastructure, a network of millions of developers as well as thousands of partners and a wide assortment of enterprise software products. Oh, and there is a massive customer base that uses productivity apps like Office.Such advantages are extremely tough to replicate.Bottom Line on Microsoft StockBut what's also important for MSFT stock is that the company has essentially gone all-in with its cloud efforts, such as integrating features among its products and engaging in aggressive M&A.For example, the company has acquired MileIQ, Xamarin and SwiftKey to bolster its mobile footprint. And more recently, MSFT has been acquiring companies in the Artificial Intelligence space. Some examples include Genee (AI-powered scheduling) and Maluuba (natural language processing).Chesapeake Energy Corporation (CHK) Stock Is an Absolute Steal Right NowYet the $27 billion purchase for LinkedIn will perhaps be the most significant for Microsoft stock. With the deal, MSFT gets the global leader in professional online networks - there are over467 million members- that should allow for powerful synergies with existing assets. Already, the company has added LinkedIn services with the Dynamics CRM platform.So yes, it should be no surprise that the quarterly reports from MSFT reflect lots of momentum. In the latestquarter, the company's Azure service, which is similar to Amazon Web Services, saw revenues spike by 93%. In fact, the annual run-rate for the total cloud segment is at over $14 billion.It's true that the cloud market is getting increasingly competitive, as seen with the efforts of companies like IBM,Oracle Corporation(NYSE:ORCL) andHewlett Packard Enterprise Co(NYSE:HPE), but they are all really playing catchup and they do not have the breadth of services that MSFT has. In other words, when it comes to playing the cloud, Microsoft stock remains a great option for investors.Tom Taulli runs the InvestorPlace blogIPO Playbookand is the author of various books, includingTaxes 2017: Saving A Bundle.Follow him on Twitter at@ttaulli.

We believe that the increasing popularity of Watson cloud bodes well for the company in the long run.We note that the growing adoption trend of the Watson platform has helped IBM outperform the S&P 500 in the last one year.

Apple Inc. Launches New Red iPhone 7, New iPad;3/21/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWe got the first hintApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) was up to something last night, when the Apple Store went down for maintenance. Then the ""We've got something special for you"" notice showed up. At 8:30 a.m. ET, we learned what AAPL was up to overnight.makeArticleAd();Source: AppleThe rumored red iPhone 7 has been added along with a new iPad to replace the iPad Air 2.Here's what you need to know about Apple's latest product releases.Red iPhone 7Apple's product launches this morning, apparently didn't warrant a special event. But thered iPhone 7is a first. It's part of the company's (PRODUCT)RED line that contributes to the Global Fund to Fight Aids. Going red is a way to stretch interest in the current iPhone 7 lineup until the new iPhone 8 is ready to go in September.When it comes to strategies for sparking new interest in an old device, adding a new color option is just about the easiest way to go.The 10 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold ForeverKeeping up interest is especially important given thatSamsung Electronics Co Ltd(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) is expected to pull out all the stops when itunveils the Galaxy S8 at the end of the month.Like the Jet Black model, the red iPhone is a special edition that is available only on iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus models with 128GB of storage or more.iPad Air Finally Gets an UpdateAAPL hasn't updated the iPad Air 2 in several years. 2014-era hardware is a tough sell for consumers, even if it is at a reduced price. Now called simply the ""iPad,"" it keeps the 9.7-inch form factor, gets a 64-bit A9 processor and starts at just $329. Thisnew iPadis aimed squarely at consumers, both in price and the new flat-out fun"" tagline.New Apple Watch Bands + ClipsThis is a bit of a yawner, but AAPL also threw in somenew Apple Watch bands. If you own an Apple Watch and you're hankering for some fresh new spring looks, Apple has you covered.It's not a new hardware product for sale, but AAPL also unveiled Tips, its new app for shooting short, ""fun"" videos on iOS, complete with special effects and soundtracks. Clips is made for those who live to share funky videos through social media.What About That April Special Event?All signs had been pointing to anApple Event in April. Presumably, this would be to show off new iPad releases and to celebrate the official opening of AAPL's new Apple Park ""spaceship"" campus.Today's new product reveals on the Apple Store should not negate the possibility that rumored special event will still happen. The company wants to make a splash about Apple Park, and its Steve Jobs Theater - which is intended to be the site for Apple product launches going forward.Why I Sold Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock (And You Should, Too)And we didn't see any of the new iPad Pro models AAPL is working on show up today. One of these is expected to be an all-new model that could debut some of the technology and design cues from the iPhone 8, a near bezel-free display and a virtual Home button among them.Those new iPad Pros could well be the first new product launch at the Steve Jobs Theater and would provide AAPL the opportunity to hint at what's to come with the new iPhone 8 in September. Evenhintsabout the iPhone 8 could help to take some of the shine off rival Samsung's Galaxy S8 launch.In the meantime, if you want a red iPhone 7 or the new iPad, you can get them starting March 24 on Apple's website and in Apple Stores. The new Apple Watch bands are available now.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceBuy Bank of America Corp (BAC) Stock Before Rates Rise Again7 Dividend Stocks With Yields That Grow Like Weeds10 Mutual Funds You Can Buy and Hold ForeverThe postApple Inc.

Salesforce (CRM) to Host Core Products in Australia with AWS;3/21/2017;"makeZacksArticleAd();CRM platform providersalesforce.com, Inc.CRMand Amazon.com, Inc.AMZNtook forward their strategic alliance, per which, Salesforce will use Amazon Web Services (AWS) to expand its customer base in Australia.Salesforce will now use AWS across all of its core products, namely, Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, App Cloud, Community Cloud and Analytics Cloud for its customers in Australia.. The move appears to be a part of Salesforce's broader infrastructure expansion plan that offers customers better ways of managing their data. The AWS Sydney Region will be available to Salesforce's customers in the second half of 2017.The deal will help Salesforce to successfully expand its international infrastructure.The Win DealThis is a big win for Salesforce, as it will join the long list of AWS users that boasts names like Netflix, Expedia and Adobe Systems. It must be noted that Salesforce's flagship CRM offering competes with Microsoft'sMSFTDynamics CRM. Microsoft ranks second in the IaaS segment, so Amazon (the market leader) is the best company Salesforce could have gone to.With this move, it appears that Salesforce is planning to shift from data centers to cloud. According to the General Manager of Salesforce Asia Pacific, Mark Innes, ""In our last quarter, APAC was the fastest-growing region for Salesforce, and we're excited to expand our infrastructure footprint to support our rapidly growing customer base in Australia"".""By leveraging the AWS Cloud, we will be able to deliver the secure, reliable and trusted services of our Intelligent Customer Success Platform locally,"" he added.Mutual BenefitsWe believe that the partnership will be mutually beneficial for both the companies going forward. It will ensure tighter integration between Amazon and Salesforce clouds, which will help customers in leveraging the security and reliability of the AWS Cloud.Cloud OpportunitiesAccording to International Data Corporation estimates, public IT cloud services spending will increase at a four-year compound annual growth rate (CAGR) (2013-2017) of 23.5%.Naturally, the overall growth expectation of the public cloud computing services market is quite bullish. According to Gartner, the worldwide public cloud services market is expected to grow 18% year over year to $246.8 billion in 2017. Further, the figure will increase to $383.3 billion by 2020.Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) is being projected as the highest growth service, driven by improvement in PaaS and massive adoption of artificial intelligence (AI), analytics and the Internet of Things (IoT).

5 Excellent ETFs for Your IRA;3/20/2017;"With the tax filing deadline of April 18 a little over four weeks away, investors still have some time to make contributions to their individual retirement accounts (IRAs) for the 2016 tax year. While some prefer traditional IRAs, many others favor Roth IRAs; both these retirement products provide amazing tax benefits.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');IRAs allow investors to buy individual stocks, bonds, ETFs or mutual funds.  ETFs are becoming increasingly popular with investors due to their low cost, transparency and tax efficiency. (Read:6 Solid Reasons to Buy Financials ETFs Now)ETFs are excellent tools for retirement investors as well since they provide an easy way to build a diversified portfolio at a low cost. Further, income paying ETFs are better placed in an IRA as income is sheltered from taxes.Before investing for retirement, investors need to assess their investing goals, time horizon and risk tolerance. They need to remember that performance of an investment portfolio depends mostly on asset allocation, i.e. how an investor allocates money among major asset classes such as stocks, bonds, alternative assets and cash.Low-cost, broad, diversified funds are more suitable for retirement investors as core, long-term investments rather than costly, narrow-focused or niche ETFs, which should mainly be used as shorter-term tactical trading vehicles. (Read:Sector ETFs to Win or Lose Post Jobs Data)Expense ratio of an ETF should be an important consideration in retirement investing, as in the long-term, cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts, other things remaining the same.Below we have highlighted five ETFs that are excellent long-term investments for retirement accounts.iShares Core S&P Total U.S. Stock Market ETF (ITOT)ITOT is a convenient way to get exposure to the entire US stock universe, ranging from some of the smallest to largest companies at an extremely low cost of just 3 basis points. It holds more than 3,600 stocks in its basket and should be a core holding in any long-term focused portfolio. (Read:Why Do Equal Weight ETFs Outperform?)Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) are its top holdings.Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF (VIG)VIG is the most popular ETF in the dividend space with AUM exceeding $24 billion. The fund holds high quality stocks that have a record of increasing dividends over the past decade. The product currently holds 185 securities in its basket.The ETF charges just 9 bps in annual fees while its dividend yield is 2.00%.Schwab U.S. Large-Cap Value ETF (SCHV)Numerous academic studies have shown that value stocks have delivered higher returns with lower volatility compared with growth stocks over the long term in almost all the markets studied. Given their proven performance over long term, value stocks and funds should be a predominant part of any 'core' portfolio.SCHV provides broad exposure to large-cap U.S. stocks with value style characteristics.It has an expense ratio of just 4 basis points, while the dividend yield at 2.5% is quite attractive.Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta US Large Cap Equity ETF (GSLC)GSLC was the first in a series of smart beta ETFs that track Goldman Sachs's proprietary indexes. This product is based on four factors--good value, strong momentum, high quality and low volatility.These factors usually outperform in different market conditions and in fact, value and momentum tend to complement each other. By combining those different factors, this ETF has a good chance of producing superior results over the long term.Further, with an expense ratio of just 9 basis points, it is one of the cheapest products in the smart beta space.Vanguard Intermediate-Term Corporate Bond ETF (VCIT)VCIT is an excellent option for fixed income investing focused on long-term. I like it better than the total bond ETFs like AGG and BND in the current rising rate scenario since total bond ETFs have outsized exposure to Treasuries. Further, intermediate-term focus also reduces its interest rate sensitivity.It has a yield of 3.4% currently while it charges just 7 basis points to provide exposure to a basket of more than 1,800 bonds high-quality corporate bonds.Zacks' 2017 IPO Watch ListBefore looking into the stocks mentioned above, you may want to get a head start on potential tech IPOs that are popping up on Zacks' radar.

Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Will Change the PC Industry;3/20/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhen you think PCs, two companies always come to mind:Microsoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) andIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC). During most of the Wintel partnership between these two companies, however, there has been a second supplier of computer CPUs.Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMD) has barely made a dent on Intel's business, but that could change with AMD's new Zen architecture chips.makeArticleAd();Source: AMDThe newest version - the Ryzen 5 - is aimed at mainstream computing and Intel's Core i5 lineup. AMD recently announced the new CPU willlaunch on April 11.Intel Dominates the CPU Market for PCsThere is no question that Intel dominates the world's PC market. Nearly nine out of 10 CPUs sold for use in computerscarry the Intel logo. It's the exclusive supplier for makers of premium computers, such as those fromApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL), while rival AMD has tended to be shunted to the side as a less expensive option on some budget PCs.At this year's Consumer Electronics Show,Intel was showing off its new Kaby Lake processors. The 7th generation of the company's Core CPUs represent a slight improvement over last year, as part of Intel's new three-phase ""Process, Architecture, Optimization"" product development cycle.In other words, a relatively boring year for Intel upgrades leaves an opening for the competition to make some noise, and AMD is doing just that with its new Zen architecture CPUs.The Ryzen 7 has already been released, but it is the Ryzen 5 that could really cause problems for Intel.AMD's Zen Architecture and Ryzen 5 Built for PC FutureAMD set out to win big with its new Zen architecture. While Intel has been content with delivering single-digit gains in performance per clock cycle, AMD says Zen offers a 52% improvement over its previous generation.The Zen chips -including the new Ryzen 5 - still lag Intel's Core CPUs on single-thread performance. That means with software that's not written specifically to take advantage of more than one or two simultaneous threads for faster processing, Intel still has the raw power edge and will offer superior performance.10 Clobbered Stocks to Buy That Are About to Get Red-HotHowever, AMD is looking at high-processor-demand applications and the future of computing. That means software that takes full advantage of multiple cores and multiple threads per core - meaning multiple instructions can be processed simultaneously.The top of the line Ryzen 5 CPU has six cores and 12 threads, for $249.It goes up against an Intel Core i5 CPUpriced at $240 with four cores and four threads.The Ryzen 5 costs a little bit more and the Intel Core i5 is going to outperform it with older applications. But with the latest generation of high demand software -think PC gaming and virtual reality- the Ryzen 5's additional cores and threads give it a significant performance advantage. Even the budget version of the Ryzen 5 CPU at $169 offers quad-core, eight thread capabilities, compared to a $174 Intel Core i3 with two cores and four threads.In thepress releaseannouncing the launch of its latest chips, AMD claims the Ryzen 5 outperforms that Intel Core i5 competition by a whopping 69% in Cinebench R15 multi-thread testing.AMD Could Disrupt the PC CPU MarketThere's been a lot of technical mumbo-jumbo thrown around as part of this conversation. What it boils down to is that Intel has moved to a money-saving, longer product life cycle strategy with its CPUs. That means modest improvements between generations and its current mainstream CPUs remain designed to deliver maximum performance with traditional software.AMD's Zen architecture offers a significant improvement over its previous generation CPUs with those traditional tasks -although it still can't best Intel. But through its entire line-up (not just the most expensive chips), AMD is emphasizing multi-core, multi-thread performance.Jim Simons Owns Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD): Should You?That gives AMD a considerable edge over Intel with the latest generation of high-demand applications, like virtual reality. Many industry insiders feelAMD could on the verge of disrupting PC gaming. By focusing on the future, not the past, AMD and chips like the new Ryzen 5 have the first real opportunity in years to steal market share from Intel.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace8 Places to Run and Hide in a Market Crash4 Consumer Stocks to Buy Before They Move HigherThe postAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc.

Is Management Really to Blame for Intel Corporation's Woes?;3/20/2017;"Brian Krzanich becameIntel's(NASDAQ: INTC) sixth CEO on  May 16, 2013. Since then,   Intel stock has rallied 46% -- which seems solid, but merely   matches the S&P 500's 46% gain and underperforms the NASDAQ's   72% gain. That performance isn't bad, but many investors have   wondered if Intel would fare better under a new leader.Last May, fellow Fool Ashraf Eassa argued that it wastime to replaceKrzanich, due to Intel's disastrous mobile strategy, its delayed   transition from 14nm to 10nm chips, and the stock's lackluster   performance. But is Krzanich the real reason that Intel failed to   outperform the market? Let's take a closer look at the biggest   problems with Krzanich's leadership, and whether or not those   flaws are dragging down Intel's growth.Intel CEO Brian Krzanich. Image source: Intel.makeArticleAd();Intel dropped the mobile ball before Krzanich took     overTo be fair, Krzanich was dealt a terrible hand in the mobile   market when he became Intel's CEO. In 2006, his predecessor Paul   Otellini sold  Intel's ARM-based Xscale business toMarvell Technology, then rejectedApple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) offer to supply application processors for    the first iPhone. At the time, Otellini didn't believe that   mobile chips would disrupt the PC market.In 2008, Intel launched its low-power Atom x86 chip for   netbooks and mobile devices, but the first generation chips were   less power efficient than ARM designs. The Atom chips gradually   improved over time, but that initial misstep enabled ARM   chipmakers likeQualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM) to take over the mobile market. ARM claims that   95% of all  smartphones in the world now use its chip   designs.But Krzanich's solutions were also ineffectiveThe good news is that Krzanich realized that Intel had to   counter ARM in the mobile market. The bad news is that his   solutions were expensive and ineffective.Krzanich tried to win back mobile OEMs by giving them steep   discounts on Atom chips, co-marketing agreements, and financial   aid in redesigning logic boards for x86 chips. The company called   those subsidies ""contra revenues"", which burned through    roughly $10 billion to  capture less than 1% of the   mobile market.Intel's Atom-powered smartphones. Image source: Intel.Krzanich then hired several major executives fromQualcomm and ARM, which was a bold move for the insular company. But those hires,   particularly that  of former Qualcomm co-president Venkata   ""Murthy"" Renduchintala, reportedly stirred up internal conflicts.   Krzanich finally admitted defeat and Intel stopped investing in    its Atom chipsets for smartphones and tablets last year,opting to pivottoward modems for the latest iPhone and next-gen 5G   chipsets instead.Pulling some iPhone modem orders from Qualcomm should have   been a victory for Intel, but Apple admitted that itthrottled the speedof  Qualcomm modems in the iPhone 7 to match the slower   speed of the Intel modems. That report casts serious doubts on   Intel's ability to effectively grow its baseband modem   business.Krzanich believes that expanding Intel's presence in the   Internet of Things (IoT) market with low-power modules like the   button-sized Curie will offset its weakness in mobile devices.   However, the  IoT business accounted for just 4% of its   revenues in 2016, and the business faces stiff competition from   low-power ARM modules.Intel could lose its dominance of PCs and data     centersLooking ahead, Intel's dominant market shares in PCs and data   centers could be threatened by new products and partnerships.AMD(NASDAQ: AMD) , for example, recently introduced its new Ryzen   x86 chips, which appear to trump Intel's current-gen Kaby Lake   chips in  terms of price-to-performance.Image source: Intel.Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) recently launched new versions of Windows 10 which   are compatible with  both Intel's x86 chips and Qualcomm's   Snapdragon chips. Microsoft also announced that it will run its   Azure cloud platform on Qualcomm's new ARM-based Centriq 2400   server solutions. These new deals could eventually throttle the   growth of Intel's core Client Computing and Data Center   businesses.Krzanich's pricey turnaround strategiesLastly, Krzanich's turnaround strategies are expensive.   Besides the $10 billion in contra revenues it burned through in   three years, Intel spent nearly $17 billion on programmable   chipmaker Altera in  late 2015, and recently announced that   it would acquire automotive collision avoidance system makerMobileyefor over $15 billion. These moves are causing Intel's long-term   debt to surge relative to its free cash flow.Source:YChartsThose acquisitions won't endanger Intel's dividends, which   used up just 35% of its FCF over the past 12 months, but they   indicate that Krzanich could ""diworsify"" the company's business   with desperately pricey acquisitions.The verdictIt's tempting to think that Intel might fare better under a   new leader, but Krzanich inherited a troubled company and I   believe he's trying to rejuvenate the company with outside hires,   expansion into new markets like non-volatile memory and IoT   chips, and strategic acquisitions.These efforts won't pay off anytime soon, since analysts   expect Intel's revenue and earnings to respectively rise just 1%   and 3% this year, but they could eventually reduce the company's   dependence on its aging PC and data center businesses.10 stocks we like better than IntelWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

3 Stocks That Turned $3,000 Into More Than $15,000 in Just 1 Year;3/20/2017;"Warren Buffet famously said that the best time to sell a stock   is never. While not even the Oracle of Omaha strictly adheres to   that rule, investors still should have an appropriately long time   horizon for the companies they put their money into. At least   three to five years is a minimum; a decade is better, anddecadesis best.Still, when companies make huge moves in a short period of   time, it's worthwhile to see what the catalysts were that caused   them to explode in value.Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD) ,Chemours(NYSE: CC) , andKEMET(NYSE: KEM) are three stocks that soared in value over the past   year so that had you invested $3,000 in any one of them, you'd be   looking at a $15,000 gain -- or better! Let's see why they made   the moves they did.Image source: Advanced Micro Devices.makeArticleAd();Advanced Micro DevicesIt was a long time coming, but Advanced Micro Devices posted   its first adjusted profits in 2016. The last time the chipmaker   was in the black, at least on a non-GAAP basis, was 2011, and   after wandering in the wilderness for so long, it was a welcome   homecoming.The basis for the gains was its ability to carve out a niche   supplying chips for the gaming industry as the PC business   declined. Early on in 2016, it signed a deal with Tianjin   Haiguang Advanced Technology Investment to license server chip   designs for new processors for gaming consoles fromNintendo,Sony, andMicrosoft, and it has recognized $88 million from the deal so far.A lot of the sentiment in favor of AMD has depended on the   ability of its Polaris, Vega, and Ryzen (aka Zen)   architectures to gain share in the GPU and CPU markets, as   well as sign more IP licensing deals with customers. By doing so,   it has once again emerged as a competitive second source toIntel(NASDAQ: INTC) , which it's planning to challenge with its new   Ryzen processors and Naples server chips.However, the company is also reportedly willing to partner   with its rival in a bid to take onNVIDIA. It will reportedly feature Intel's CPUs alongside its own GPUs   in what can only be described as a case of ""the enemy of my   enemy is my friend.""There's still a lot of ground for Advanced Micro Devices to   make up, but that seems to bode well for further gains in its   stock, which has risen from well under $3 a share in March 2016   to over $14 a stub today. The 436% gain would have turned $3,000   into more than $16,000 in just one year.Image source: Chemours.ChemoursSpun off fromDuPont(NYSE: DD) in 2015, performance chemicals specialist Chemours was   seen as set up for failure from the beginning, with lots of debt   and toxic assets its former parent wanted to shield itself from.   The titanium dioxide market that had bolstered the balance sheets   of DuPont,Dow Chemical,Kronos Worldwide, andHuntsman, the world's four largest producers of the white pigment, also   imploded.However, though it initially lost 85% of its value in its   first seven months as a separate company, Chemours has gone on to   be a star performer. It did so by cutting expenses and its   workforce, and by shedding or shutting non-core assets. In 2016,   Chemours reduced costs by $200 million, improved operating cash   flows by $412 million, and retired $385 million in long-term   debt. While the TiO2 business it inherited from DuPont is still   weak, the performance chemicals leader was still able to raise   prices last year, showing it still possesses substantial power in   the industry and allowing it to more than double its adjusted   earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization   margins to $157 million.Shares of Chemours have gone from less than $7 each to over   $33, a better than 400% gain that would have transformed $3,000   into more than $15,000. It still has some substantial risks   ascribed to it, but it's a much better business than it was when   it first hit the public markets.Image source: KEMET.KEMETThe world's largest manufacturer of solid tantalum capacitors   and one of the biggest makers of multilayer ceramic capacitors   used across automotive, communications, and military   and aerospace industries, KEMET has been on the rise since   the November elections, perhaps on the promise by President   Trump of increased infrastructure spending that would dwarf   the stimulus spending package of his predecessor.However, last month, KEMET's stock surged nearly 23% in one   day after announcing it was acquiring NEC TOKIN, a Japanese   manufacturer of tantalum capacitors, in which it had already   owned a substantial stake. While the purchase brings new   capabilities under KEMET's purview and enhances existing lines,   there seems to be little reason for the outsized gains the deal   generated.When KEMET originally took a stake in TOKIN, regulators had no   problem signing off on the deal because there were no competitive   concerns raised, and it would only increase KEMET's market share   incrementally. Of course, that was a few years ago, and now KEMET   will own the entire company, but the playing field does appear to   have been significantly altered to warrant the outsized gain.Even so, KEMET's stock is up 440% over the past year, most of   it since November, when it went from trading around $3.60 per   share to today, where it stands north of $11 a share. That would   mean it would have turned $3,000 into more than $16,000.   Considering it had been trading sideways for much of 2016, those   gains have largely occurred in about just four months' time,   making its compounded growth rate really much larger.10 stocks we like better than Advanced Micro   DevicesWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

IBM's Cloud Computing Holds Potential: Should You Buy?;3/20/2017;"International Business Machines Corp'sIBMrecent investor briefing reflected its continuing focus on being a cloud-first company. Notably, cloud revenues grew 35% to $13.7 billion for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock in 2016. You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank   stocks here.makeArticleAd();The annual exit run rate for cloud as-a-service revenue increased 53% on a year-over-year basis to $8.6 billion. Moreover, IBM had more than 50 cloud centers globally and its Bluemix platform was one of the largest open public cloud deployments worldwide at the end of 2016.We note that the impressive growth has helped IBM outperform the S&P 500 in the last one year. While the stock has gained 18.1%, S&P increased 15.3% in the same period.Cloud Computing: Robust Growth ExpectationsWe note that IBM's growth expectations from cloud computing remains positive in the long haul. Management expects market opportunity in enterprise cloud to be greater than $800 billion by 2020. Moreover, the company anticipates more than 85% of enterprises to commit to multi-cloud architectures by 2018, which is positive for its hybrid cloud offerings.As such, the overall growth expectation for the public cloud computing services market is very much bullish. According to Gartner, worldwide public cloud services market is projected to grow 18% over 2016 to $246.8 billion in 2017. Further, the figure will increase to $383.3 billion by 2020.Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) is projected to be the highest growth service driven by improvement in PaaS and massive adoption of artificial intelligence (AI), analytics and the Internet of Things (IoT). IaaS is projected to grow from $25.29 billion in 2016 to $71.55 billion in 2020.IBM Lags Behind in the CloudDespite the impressive growth figures and bullish sentiments, we note that IBM lags behind the likes of AmazonAMZNand MicrosoftMSFTin the public PaaS and IaaS cloud computing markets.According to Synergy Research's latest report Amazon Web Services (AWS) maintained its dominant position in the market followed by Microsoft Azure, Alphabet'sGOOGLGoogle and IBM at the end of fourth-quarter 2016.The research firm noted that these three have gained market share in the last one year at the expense of smaller players as well as strong performance from Microsoft and Google. However, their combined market share of 23% lags a fare bit as compared with Amazon's 40%.We believe that IBM's hybrid approach is yet to find many takers in both the public and private cloud markets. Despite significant investments - first on acquiring SoftLayer for $2 billion and then spending more than $1 billion on data centers - the clientele is not as impressive as Amazon or Microsoft.China: IBM's Savior?Per Gartner, China has become a significant IaaS cloud market. The research firm noted that ""While China's cloud service market is nascent and several years behind the U.S. and European markets, it is expected to maintain high levels of growth as digital transformation becomes more mainstream over the next five years.""IBM is now planning to tap into China's fast- growing cloud computing market through a new company formed in collaboration with Wanda Internet Technology Group. The new company will offer IaaS and Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) to Chinese enterprises and businesses. Reportedly, IBM will have a share in revenues.Moreover, as a part of the deal, the company will launch Watson services to China. IBM is expected to offer Watson Conversation services at the first, which will allow developers to add natural language interactions between applications and client.ConclusionDespite lagging in competition, we believe that IBM is developing a niche for its hybrid cloud services along with ""Strategic Imperatives"" (cognitive computing, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning).IBM Watson on Cloud is a key growth driver in IoT, healthcare and financial services end-markets. IBM Watson is anticipated to reach more than 1 billion people by the end of 2017. Moreover, Blockchain initiatives, Quantum computing, Containers are some of the other catalysts that will support growth trajectory in the long run.Zacks' 2017 IPO Watch ListBefore looking into the stocks mentioned above, you may want to get a head start on potential tech IPOs that are popping up on Zacks' radar.

Last year, at its F8 Developer Conference, the company announced Building 8-a DARPA style research facility, spearheaded by Regina Dugan, a former Alphabet executive. Notably, Dugan served as DARPA's director prior to her Alphabet appointment. It had also unveiled Area 404, a 22,000 sq feet sprawling hardware research lab at it Menlo Park headquarters to boost ""modeling, prototyping, and failure analysis in-house."" Last year, it also snapped up startup-Nascent Objects-for an undisclosed amount to step up its hardware efforts.Moreover, media reports add that Facebook at this year's F8 is likely to unveil four consumer hardware products. These include drones, brain scanning technology, augmented reality and next gen cameras. At present, Facebook sells one consumer hardware product, namely, Oculus Rift, a VR headset. The company had acquired the product for $2 billion in 2014. With Oculus, the company is trying to fuel the company's ambitious AR/VR efforts.Facebook, Inc. PriceFacebook, Inc. Price|Facebook, Inc.

A Driverless Race Car, a New 360-Degree Camera, and 3 Other Highlights From Mobile World Congress;3/19/2017;"In February, over 2,300 companies showed up at Mobile World   Congress 2017. The annual event, hosted by the GSM Association (a   trade organization for mobile operators), is an opportunity   for the wireless and tech community to showcase its best   ideas. Here were five of this year's high points.Nokia phones 3.0Wireless connections have become the driving force behind many   of today's biggest innovations. It is ironic, then, that one of   the big hits at MWC this year was a dead-but-resuscitated   favorite from the past.Image source: Nokia.makeArticleAd();Nokia(NYSE: NOK) , which primarily concerns itself these days with   wireless network services, has licensed out its phone business to   HMD Global. The start-up phone maker released a revamped 3310   ""dumbphone,"" which was a staple in its early 2000s heyday but   went by the wayside when smartphones became a thing. The new 3310   will purportedly have the same near-indestructible build as the   original but sport a color screen instead of the original   monochrome display.It's a no-frills option the phone maker hopes will find a   niche in today's fancy-smartphone market. The Nokia name will   also be featured on three affordably priced smartphones the   company is trying to market on its own. AfterMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT)  failed in revitalizing Nokia phones a few   years ago, maybe this time things will be different.360-degree camera actionMWC 2017 also had its fair share of new smartphone previews.   One of them, built by the obscure company Protruly of China, was   touted as the world's first ""virtual reality"" phone and has a   360-degree camera built in.How does it work? Two fisheye lenses are built into the top,   one mounted to the front and one at the back. Users can preview   recordings taken on the phone in sphere-shaped videos and then   quickly upload them to sites like YouTube. The phone is not for   sale outside China right now, but it presents a unique feature   that is worth monitoring for popularity.Samsung battles the Microsoft SurfaceImage source: Samsung.Samsung(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) delayed unveiling its new Galaxy 8 phone. On   display instead was a new tablet designed to go toe-to-toe with   Microsoft's Surface series.In its last fiscal year, Microsoft's Surface sales increased   by $486 million, a 13% increase over the previous year. Samsung   would like to take a chunk out of that nearly $4 billion   business, and its new Galaxy Book could do that as it sports   similar looks and features to the Surface.The devices are still a win for Microsoft, though, as Samsung   Books will use Windows 10 as an operating system. Whether it's a   Galaxy Book or Surface sale, the popularity of ""tablets that   replace your laptop"" earns Microsoft revenue either way.Technology for blue-collar workersA lot of attention has been given to virtual reality the last   few years, but most estimates anticipate augmented reality to be   the bigger market. This is because of the possible applications   in the workplace, everything from digital workstations to data   visualization.Image source: DAQRI.Enter the company DAQRI, which showcased its smart helmet at   MWC. The helmet was designed with industrial workers in mind and   has the ability to overlay everything from data to thermal vision   onto the wearer's view of the real world.The device is powered by anIntel(NASDAQ: INTC) processor and uses input from multiple sensors,   including a basic camera, an infrared camera, and a thermal scale   camera. It puts on display Intel's work in the augmented- and   merged-reality space, and gives us a glimpse into what future   workplaces could look like -- at least workplaces requiring a   hard hat.A self-driving race carA company called Roborace showed up with the world's first   driverless electric race car. The futuristic machine was built to   compete in Formula E, a new all-electric racing circuit started a   few years ago, but the company hopes that one day autonomous   racing will be a thing.In Robocar, it's all about the tech. Instead of a driver and a   pit crew, there is a computer programmed by a team of techies.   Roborace is usingNVIDIA(NASDAQ: NVDA) chips as the brain powering its vehicles.Image source: Roborace.Car races have a long history of being the testing ground for   features we now take for granted while driving. Things like disc   brakes, rearview mirrors, and push-button ignition all got their   start on the track. Roborace sees its autonomous racers helping   develop future autonomous cars for the general public. The   information learned can help automakers and tech companies like   NVIDIA home in on what works best for cars of the future.Mobile World Congress has developed into more than a show for   phones and mobile providers; it's a venue for companies that rely   on wireless tech to show off their latest developments. Investors   can watch the action to see what's the future might look   like.10 stocks we like better than NokiaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Microsoft and Alphabet Are Catching Up to Amazon in the Cloud;3/17/2017;"Amazon.com's(NASDAQ: AMZN) all-important Amazon Web Services (AWS) segment   has been the undisputed leader of cloud infrastructure, by far,   for years. The most recent third-party estimate from Canalys pegs   AWS global market share at nearly 34% in the fourth quarter,   larger than the next three largest competitors --Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) ,Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) , andIBM-- combined (31%).Competition is heating up, and rivals are starting to chip   away at AWS' dominance.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();AWS is hugely important to the Amazon thesisThat's the underlying theme of a research note from Pacific   Crest (viaTech Trader Daily). Analyst Brent Bracelin is reiterating an overweight rating but   slightly reducing his price target from $905 to $895, while   expressing some concern that Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud are   starting to catch up and ""becom[e] more viable."" The software and   search giants both continue to invest heavily in their cloud   offerings, both in terms of technical capability as well as   geographic expansion and reach.Since AWS is immensely more profitable that Amazon's core   e-commerce business, its results carry a disproportionate weight   when it comes to the bottom line, and strong AWS performance has   been a key driver of Amazon's rally over the past two years,   which has seen shares more than double.AMZNdata byYCharts.Microsoft Azure is making inroads at large enterprise   customers and government agencies, which are increasingly   transitioning their needs away from their own data center   infrastructures and toward public cloud platforms. Google Cloud   has scored a high-profile win inSnap, which has committed to spending $2 billion with the search   giant and is onlyusing AWS as a backup. Google also recently announced a handful of other big wins for   its cloud business.Bracelin still believes that AWS has a ""multiyear competitive   lead,"" despite rivals starting to catch up in different ways. As   a result, he is tempering his expectations for growth for the   next two years. Overall, the analyst considers decelerating   growth a ""minor concern,"" but it's definitely something that   should be on investors' radar.Rising cloud use lifts all infrastructure vendorsIt's worth pointing out that the cloud infrastructure market   is growing so fast -- up 49% last year and expected to jump   another 46% this year -- that there should be plenty to go   around. The cloud infrastructure market could generate a total of   $55.8 billion in total revenue this year. Of course, the dominant   vendors will compete aggressively, but we're not talking about   zero-sum competition.10 stocks we like better than AmazonWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

3 Companies Set to Make a Killing From Driverless Cars;3/17/2017;"Driverless car technology is still in its nascent stage but   will grow in leaps and bounds in the coming years. IHS Automotive   forecasts that autonomous vehicle sales will shoot up from   600,000 units in 2025 to almost 21 million by 2035, clocking a   compound annual growth rate of 43%.The Boston Consulting Group, meanwhile, expects the driverless   car market to create a $42 billion revenue opportunity in 2025   itself, indicating that there is a lot of money to be made in   this space. One of the ways to tap this huge opportunity is   through technology providers such asAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) ,Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) , andNVIDIA(NASDAQ: NVDA) , as they will play mission-critical roles in   enabling autonomous cars.NVIDIA's GPUs are boosting self-driving technologyNVIDIA is best known for making gaming graphics cards, but its   products are in high demand from automakers as well.Tesla, for instance, is using the chipmaker's artificial   intelligence-based DRIVE PX2 platform in the Model S and Model X   cars. What's more, the automaker is also going to deploy NVIDIA's   supercomputer in its mass-market Model 3.makeArticleAd();The Tesla partnership is already delivering results, as   NVIDIA's automotive revenue shot up over 37% year over year for   the fiscal fourth quarter. The company could sustain its   automotive momentum, as it is working with German giant Audi to   bring a Level 4 autonomous car to the market by 2020. Level 4   means it can drive itself entirely on its own.The two companies showcased an Audi Q7 at CES earlier this   year, claiming that the car learned to drive on its own in just   four days using NVIDIA's AI-based DRIVE PX2 supercomputer. More   importantly, NVIDIA is looking to push the envelope: It's now   working on a more advanced supercomputing platform -- Xavier --   that consumes less power but packs more computing capacity.NVIDIA's graphics processing units accelerate the processing   of huge amounts of data in real time, allowing the vehicle to   make quick decisions. As the company increasingly turns its   attention toward making its self-driving supercomputers better   through partnerships with big auto companies, it won't be   surprising if its platform ends up powering fully autonomous cars   by 2020.NVIDIA, therefore, looks right on the edge of tapping the   driverless car opportunity, as 80 companies are using the DRIVE   PX2 platform to develop their technology.Microsoft's big data opportunityDriverless cars, or any connected car for that matter, will   generate huge volumes of data from their sensors and cameras that   will need storage and processing. Microsoftwants to ingestall this data and then use its artificial intelligence (AI)   skills to analyze it to help cars drive better through its Azure   cloud-based Connected Vehicle Platform.Image source: Microsoft.The Redmond-based company has picked a sweet spot to tap the   driverless car opportunity, as a connected vehicle is slated to   produce 20 gigabytes of data per day in 2017 if driven for just   two hours. In the case of autonomous cars, the data generation   could be at least 10 gigabytes per second. Now, all this data   can't be stored on the car itself due to limited storage   capacity, creating an opportunity for Microsoft to push its cloud   product to automakers.TheRenault-Nissanalliance has already decided to use the software giant's   connected vehicle platform, pledging to put 10 cars with   autonomous technology on the road by 2020. Additionally, Indian   automakerTata Motorsis adopting the platform to bring connectivity   features and predictive maintenance at affordable prices to   mass-market vehicles in India.Microsoft is also finding demand for its connected car   platform beyond automakers. For instance, reinsurance provider   Swiss Re will analyze driving behavior with the help of the   telematics data collected by the cloud, and then create   customized insurance deals for customers.The inevitable data increase from driverless and connected   cars could power Microsoft's Azure cloud business to new highs in   the long run, allowing it to sustain rapid revenue growth from   this segment.Image source: Waymo.Alphabet's Waymo moonshot could be a big businessAlphabet's Waymo division has thebest driverless cartechnology, according to data from the California DMV. As it   turns out, its driverless cars have the lowest incidence rates   and the highest miles logged compared to the others testing their   technology on California roads.Alphabet can use its lead in this space by becoming an   infrastructure and knowledge supplier to auto companies, and this   is what it is probably planning to do. Earlier this year, Waymo   announced that it is going to manufacture   driverless-technology-enabling sensors on its own so that it can   better integrate the software into hardware.In fact, the Waymo division has slashed the price of the   crucial LIDAR sensor by 90% since 2009, so it makes sense for it   to offer a packaged hardware-software bundle to potential   customers. The company has already gained a customer in the form   ofFiat Chrysler Automobilesfor its self-driving technology, with Bloombergreportingthat both companies could eventually roll out a ride-sharing   service.On the other hand,Hondaseems to be warming up to Waymo's self-driving capabilities to   accelerate its own driverless car development. The Japanese   automaker is now exploring the possibility of equipping its cars   with fully autonomous driving technology in cities instead of its   earlier ambition of just highway driving.Therefore, Alphabet's years of leadership in driverless cars   make it one of the hottest prospects to benefit from this   emerging technology.10 stocks we like better than MicrosoftWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock       tip, it can pay to listen.

The other day we saw a good quarter fromOracle(ORCL) and now we get another good report fromAdobe Systems(ADBE).Last night after the close ADBE reported EPS of $0.78 when the Zacks Consensus Estimate was calling for $0.72.  That $0.06 beat translates into an 8.3% positive earnings surprise and it is the fourth straight beat of the Zacks Consensus Estimate.GrowthI am a growth guy and just based on the size of the companies like ADBE and ORCL I would avoid them.  My thinking was that the best days were behind these names and growth would be very hard to come by.  I am adjusting my thinking on the big cap tech names.Let's look at the ADBE and specifically the topline. As a growth guy, I am much more interested in what is going up top than on the bottom line.  Don't get me wrong, earnings are super important, but to me, I need to see what is causing the growth and why.Follow Brian Bolan on Twitter: @BBolan1ADBE Top LineThe topline number of $1.68B was better than the consensus estimate of $1.64B.  Now that is already what I want to see, but as I dug in deeper, I really liked what I saw.Digital Media was $1.4B and that was well ahead of the $1.11B consensus estimate.Digital Marketing was $501M, again ahead of the $487M estimate.Print and Publishing came in just barely ahead of the consensus at $42M.Seeing this brought a smile to my face. I love to see revenue come in ahead of the consensus.  But this next line item really stunned me.Annualized Recurring Revenue was $4.25B compared to a consensus number of $4.21B and up from $3.98B in the prior quarter.AnalystsWunderlich Securities upped the stock to buy from hold and increased their target price to $145 from $115.  Analysts at Pivotal, Atlantic Equities, Cowen and Deutsche Bank all increased their target prices. Pivotal remains somewhat cautious on the stock as the maintained their hold rating and moved their target price to $109 from $104.  With the stock trading $127 and showing good revenue growth, that target price looks rather bearish to me.52 Week HighAdobe traded as high as $130.30 today and that is a new 52 week high for the stock. The move higher by around $5 puts the 5-year run at roughly +$95 or 280%.  To me, this stock could easily see a similar run over the next five years as well.Zacks RankRight now, ADBE is Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).  All the estimates aren't in yet and when they do get in I would not be surprised to see this stock become a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Adobe Systems Incorporated Price and ConsensusAdobe Systems Incorporated Price and Consensus|Adobe Systems Incorporated QuoteWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Facebook Roundup: Video, Sports, Jobs, VR, Fake News, Etc.;3/17/2017;"FacebookFBshares have appreciated 4.8% over the past month, easily beating the S&P 500 average increase of 1.3% and the 2.8% appreciation of the Internet Services market, to which it belongs.The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock (You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy)   stocks here) hasn't seen estimate revisions during this time, but given its Growth Score A and promise to invest heavily in the business this year, that isn't really surprising.So what's the reason for the enthusiasm about Facebook? Read on to find out.Sports Deals Are Rolling InSocial networks are a big boon for sports leagues and rights holders because of dwindling viewership on traditional platforms like TV, especially among younger audiences. Social networks also facilitate better interactions with the event by combining viewership, commentary and reactions to a game, making it a more enjoyable experience.They also help content providers reach their audience directly, resulting in innovations that can further personalize the experience. That's the reason they have been trying out events on both Facebook and Twitter.Over the past month, Facebook signed on Major League Baseball (MLB) for a game a week and Univision Communications for 46 Liga MX games (live games from Mexico's top soccer league). The Liga MX games are targeted at U.S. audiences only with Tonia O'Connor, Univision's chief commercial office and president of content distribution expecting it to better connect with and grow its English speaking audience.Video Is the FutureFacebook has launched a new TV app for AmazonAMZNFire TV, AppleAAPLTV and Samsung Smart TV, with possible plans to further expand to other platforms like MicrosoftMSFTXbox, SonySNEPlayStation and other streaming devices. While this will likely enable/support longer video formats, Facebook has said its intention is not to compete with Netflix but rather to enable Facebook users to watch their preferred video on just about any screen of their choice (and that includes TV screens).Of course that's not the only video announcement Facebook made. The company says that henceforth, videos will play automatically with the sound turned on by default (if the device sound is turned on) and the window will retreat to the bottom corner of the screen so you can keep watching the video while scrolling through your newsfeed. Facebook says that testing shows positive reaction from users although it's obvious that not everyone will be overjoyed.Facebook is also reportedly in talks with music labels to bring their content to the app, which seems like an open challenge to YouTube, Google's competing site. For labels, the new distribution channel will increase their leverage against YouTube for more favorable terms. On the flip side, the chances of piracy will increase given the nature of Facebook's free platform.The increased scope for advertising is also an indication that the company is gearing up to grab its share of TV ad dollars.Time for a VR Reality CheckLast year saw a lot of hype related to virtual reality (VR), which was billed as the next major platform for consumer-type experiences after the mobile revolution. SuperData Research reportedly had very ambitious growth targets of $5.1 billion in 2016 (from $600 million in 2015) to $8.9 billion by 2017 and $12.3 billion by 2018. The longer term estimates are even more optimistic: Citigroup reportedly says that the AR/VR market will generate $2.16 trillion by 2035.Near term, however, things don't look so good, with the market doing just $1.8 billion in 2016. The primary drawbacks to adoption seem to be compelling content and software tailored for the VR experience and still-high prices for a technology that is still in its very early days.Sufficient software won't be available until there are big enough platforms, whether based on Occulus or Google's Daydream, which is why the two companies are pushing away regardless.Device prices vary hugely ranging from the (HTC Vive at $799, PlayStation VR at $399 and Occulus' own Rift somewhere in between at $599 without the $199 for the Touch motion controllers). Others like Microsoft, Apple and even Alphabet'sGOOGLGoogle have invested in augmented reality (AR).Facebook chose the high end because it has always held that for VR to succeed, the feeling must be good, not the quick-heating, nauseating experience enabled through smartphones. And because it wants to ultimately enable social networking using the technology. At any rate, the company has now decided to scale back the number of Best Buy store-within-stores from 500 to 300. It's also decided to lower the price of Rift+Touch to $598. The strategy makes sense: bring more people on the platform to finance its further development.Activists Don't Want Zuckerberg as Board   ChairpersonA group of activist shareholders, part of a consumer watchdog group called SumOfUs have proposed that an independent chairperson would better ""oversee the executives of the company, improve corporate governance, and set a more accountable, pro-shareholder agenda."" It won't be easy to beat Zuckerberg since he holds the majority voting power, but according to Lisa Lindsley, the capital markets adviser for SumOfUs, the proposal ""is advisory in nature… There could be a 99% vote in favor of it and the board would not be under legal obligation to implement it. However, most competent board members realize that it is unwise to ignore the voice of the shareholders whose interests they are charged with representing.""Facebook Job PostsFacebook has found another use for its sprawling network: it is now connecting employers with employees. While LinkedIn (now part of Microsoft) has been around for a while, the site is more popular with higher-income groups. Facebook on the other hand has people from every walk of life and employers of every kind on its network, so it's in a very good position to corner a much larger section of the market than LinkedIn ever reached.A Fake News Solution?Facebook has said that it will tag news stories that an independent group of people say are fake with a ""disputed"" tag. It won't remove the stories however. Facebook has been on pulled up by the media since Trump won the elections and some people went as far as to say that the win was facilitated by moving sentiments with the help of fake news stories.Other NewsNew Accounts Chief: LinkedIn VP, controller, and chief accounting officer Susan   Taylor will join Facebook as its chief accounting officer next   month for an annual base salary of $400,000, annual bonus, a   one-time, non-recurring sign-on bonus of $400,000 and restricted   stock units with an initial value of about $3.5 million.New VR Chief: Facebook has made an important hire in Hugo Barra, who has   spent the last three years revving up the marketing machinery at   Xiaomi (the success of the Mi3 and Redmi smartphones are   attributed to him) and serving as Google's Android chief before   that. Barra will replace Brendan Iribe as Oculus head and will   also head up all VR efforts at Facebook. Iribe will move to the   PC division, to speed up PC-based VR development.New Content Head: Facebook has snapped up Mina Lefevre, who was in charge of   scripted programming at MTV to head up its content development   efforts. She will report to Ricky Van Veen, co-founder of   CollegeHumor.WhatsApp Monetization in India: Facebook is looking to launch WhatsApp for Business in India   where 15% of its user base (200 million) is located with the goal   of allowing commercial messaging to small businesses of up to 10   employees. This will help monetize the platform and if   successful, lead to a broader rollout across the world.Sued for Occulus Tech: A jury has decided that ZeniMax will receive $500 million from   Oculus owner Facebook as it was guilty of copyright infringement,   the failure to comply with a non-disclosure agreement, and for   the misuse of Oculus trademarks. The amount to be paid is split   up as follows- $200 million for violating a non-disclosure   agreement, $50 million for copyright infringement and $50 million   for improper use of ZeniMax trademarks. ZeniMax will also pick up   $150 million in damages from Brendan Iribe and $50 million in   damages from Palmer Luckey, the two Oculus co-founders. However,   the court ruled that the Rift maker wasn't guilty of trade secret   theft, a point that will be used by Oculus to frame its   appeal.German Case: A Syrian refugee brought a case against Facebook requesting an   injunction for hosting fake posts that linked him to crimes and   militant attacks. Facebook acted quickly to block the posts after   they were pointed out by the plaintiff's lawyer and the court   ruled that Facebook was ""neither perpetrator nor a participant""   in the ""undisputable defamation."" The plaintiff maintains that   the fake information can be viewed outside Germany and also   within Germany using the sophisticated Tor browser, but the court   ruled that its visibility by average Germans was limited. Whether   other actions were required or possible has to be decided by   experts according to the court. The plaintiff has one month after   the written order is passed to appeal the decision. This is an   important win given that regulators are already considering a law   related to hate speech on Facebook.Italian Lawsuit: Facebook has been fighting a copyright case in Italy where   Italian software developer Business Competence claimed that its   ""Nearby Places in Italy"" feature was a copy of the company's   highly popular Faround app. Last year, a Milan court ruled that   Facebook would have to pay a fine of 5,000 euros per day for   copyright infringement and unfair competition if it didn't remove   the feature. The social networking company has now removed the   feature and has said it will appeal after a request to have the   order put on hold while it awaited a ruling on the merits of the   case was rejected.Media Audit Okayed: After repeated admitting that it miscalculated advertising   metrics, Facebook finally agreed to be audited by the Media   Rating Council. This should pacify advertisers because the   accreditation service is also used by many of them (and   publishers) thus adding to its credibility.New Video Ad Format: Facebook has said that it is going to start showing ads inside   videos, not the pre-roll ads that YouTube uses but mid-roll, when   you're around 20 seconds into the video. There can also be more   than one commercial break in the video, but these will be at   least two minutes apart.Chatbot Scale Back: Facebook wanted Messenger to be the go-to place for brands to   interact with their customers. So the company launched chatbot   developer tools roughly a year ago. While it initially announced   that nearly 11K chatbots had been developed, there hasn't been   much news recently about new apps. Now, the Information reports   that many of the chatbots weren't able to answer 70% of customer   queries, leading Facebook to shelve the idea for now.Messenger Enhancements: But The Information also has good things to say about   Messenger. For one, it reports that Facebook is starting an   artificial intelligence (AI)-powered suggestions feature wherein   nearby places for shopping or entertainment can be discovered. It   is also apparently working on a native payments platform that   will allow users to make payments. The enhancements will   reportedly be announced at its annual developer conference in   April.Money Transfer Through Messenger: London-based TransferWise has launched a new service through a   chatbot that allows Facebook users to make international money   transfers (from the United States, Britain, Canada, Australia and   Europe) through Messenger.5 Trades Could Profit ""Big-League"" from Trump   PoliciesIf the stocks above spark your interest, wait until you look into companies primed to make substantial gains from Washington's changing course.Today Zacks reveals 5 tickers that could benefit from new trends like streamlined drug approvals, tariffs, lower taxes, higher interest rates, and spending surges in defense and infrastructure.See these buy recommendations now >>Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Microsoft Corporation (MSFT): Surface Book 2 May Ditch the Tablet Form;3/17/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhenMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) released the Surface Book 2-in-1 notebook PC in late 2015, it turned a lot of heads. Its signature dynamic fulcrum hinge and detachable display were impressive.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockApparently, MSFT's first foray into building its own PC was not impressiveenoughto generate sales, though.According to a report fromDigiTimes, the company's Surface Book 2 will arrive in the next month or so. If the website is correct, the Surface Book 2 will arrive as a traditional laptop - no removable tablet screen - and will feature a significantly lower price in an effort to jumpstart the numbers.The Surface BookWhen Microsoft decided to take the next step into the hardware game by building its own laptop, it wanted to enter the market with a premium device. One that would show consumers and other manufacturers what a flagship laptop could do with Windows 10.The key features on the Surface Book were its removable display - able to be used as a standalone Windows tablet - and the dynamic fulcrum hinge that made the transformation possible. Although it was an engineering marvel, the hinge did have the downside of making the laptop thicker and a gap allowed dirt to get into the keyboard when closed. WhenMSFT refreshed the device in late 2016, it was not the Surface Book 2 some had hoped for, but a spec bump with a slight tweaking on that hinge.Surface Book Sales Failed to MaterializeWhile Microsoft accomplished the goal of making its mark as a premium PC vendor and won kudos for the Surface Book's innovative design, this didn't pay off with sales. The MSFT 2-in-1 laptop caused some overlap with the Surface Pro - a tablet with an optional keyboard case that could turn it into a laptop. With a price range of $1,499 to $3,199, it was also expensive, which didn't help.6 Tech Stocks to Buy for the VR BoomThe companybragged about convertsfromApple Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AAPL) MacBook laptops, especially when theMacBook Pro launch stumbled. But it was always careful to refer to Surface as a platform, instead of specifically saying those disappointed Mac fans switched to a Surface Book.DigiTimessays the companyshipped just 500,000 Surface Books in 2016. Apple, in comparison, sold nearly5.9 million Mac laptops in the first half of 2016alone.PC Worldput it this way: ""it's unclear whether the Surface Book is unpopular or simply niche.""Reports of poor Surface Book sales had analysts questioning whether MSFT would even bother releasing a Surface Book 2.Surface Book 2Based on information from MSFT's supply chain,DigiTimesreports that the Surface Book 2 is not only a go, but that it has entered mass production. Those sources believe Microsoft will announce its new laptop in the coming weeks.They also claim it is a true laptop, not a 2-in-1 form factor. Dropping the dynamic fulcrum hinge and detachable display addresses three key issues with the original Surface Book: confusion with Surface tablets, cost and thickness.DigiTimes'sources say the Surface Book 2 will be a traditional, clamshell style laptop with a 13.5-inch display and magnesium alloy case. With a $1,000 starting price, it would undercut most Apple laptops, although it would still be seen as a premium Windows laptop. Those sources are projecting shipments that could triple the original Surface Books' numbers, hitting as high as 1.5 million units for 2017.How Likely Are the Surface Book 2 Rumors?As usual, reports originating from unnamed supply chain sources must be taken with a grain of salt. The Surface Book 2 report seems credible. If the new MSFT laptop is in production, the information is likely to be fairly accurate at this point.DigiTimesis also the outlet that first broke the news about theMSFT Surface Studio. And the overall strategy of pivoting to a traditional laptop form factor makes sense.Get in Early on Bank of America Corp (BAC) EarningsMicrosoft took several attempts to get the formula right with its popular Surface Pro tablets. It's only natural it might shake things up with the Surface Book 2. Will a lower price and ditching the detachable screen pay off for MSFT? Or will the Surface Book 2 get lost in a sea of lookalike Windows 10 ultrabooks? IfDigiTimesis right, we will find out in the next month or so.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 Safe Dividend Stocks to Own During the Next Market Crash3 Winning Stocks to Buy That Will Humble Wall Street AnalystsThe postMicrosoft Corporation (MSFT): Surface Book 2 May Ditch the Tablet Formappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Google and Facebook Will Account for 74% of Digital Ad Growth in 2017;3/17/2017;"Marketers will continue to shift a larger percentage of their ad budgets to digital in 2017. U.S. digital ad spending is expected to reach $83 billion this year, up 16% according toeMarketer.By far, the two biggest digital advertisers areFacebook(NASDAQ: FB) and Google, a subsidiary ofAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) . The two will combine to take 57% of the market this year. That's up from 54% last year as the two combine to take about 74% of all the growth in U.S. ad spend.makeArticleAd();Even with the recent introduction of ads on the extremely popular Snapchat fromSnap(NYSE: SNAP) and continued pressure fromTwitter(NYSE:TWTR) andMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) , the two giants continue to completely dominate the competition.Image source: Google.Google search takes $0.78 of every dollarGoogle's biggest business, search, is also its biggest growth driver. Google's search ad revenue is expected to climb 16% this year compared to its overall revenue growth of 15%. eMarketer expects Google to take 78% of all U.S. search ad spend as it takes share from Microsoft and other smaller competitors. The search giant will bring in about $28.6 billion from search ads this year, according to the research group.Google's growth stems largely from mobile. Android is the most popular mobile operating system in the U.S., and Google is the default search engine on iOS, the second most popular mobile operating system. Microsoft's efforts to penetrate the mobile market largely fell flat, although it is the search engine behind Siri on iOS.Americans use Google for about 94% of their searches on mobile. As mobile continues to account for more and more of our time, Google's lead in search will only grow wider.Facebook dominates display advertisingWhile Google grows more dominant in search, Facebook is increasingly dominant in display ads. eMarketer expects Facebook's U.S. advertising to grow 32.1% to $16.33 billion this year. Google is its next closest competitor, and it's expected to generate just $5.24 billion from display ads.Image source: Facebook.eMarketer's projection for U.S. ad revenue growth is actually below analysts' consensus estimate for Facebook's overall revenue growth this year. It's worth noting the U.S. is historically Facebook's largest and one of the faster-growing regions in terms of revenue. However, saturation in ad load could cause U.S. ad growth to slow more significantly compared to regions where Facebook has faster user growth.Instagram will make a significant contribution to Facebook's U.S. ad revenue this year, growing to account for about 20% of Facebook's total on mobile, up from 15% last year. Mobile accounted for 84% of Facebook's total ad revenue last quarter.The competition can't touch Facebook or GoogleOne of Facebook and Google's biggest competitors in display advertising, Twitter, is expected to see its mobile ad revenue decline for the first time in its history. Its revenue on mobile devices will fall about 5% to $1.15 billion, according to eMarketer. Mobile accounted for 89% of Twitter's total ad revenue in the fourth quarter.The expected to decline comes after management provided anemic first-quarter guidance and followed it up byde-emphasizing certain ad products. Twitter is shifting its focus to its most profitable products in order to make good on its effort to become profitable this year.Meanwhile, Snapchat is a growing force in video ads. Indeed, eMarketer expects the company's U.S. ad revenue to grow 158% to $770 million. Even with its robust growth, Snap's app revenue still only accounts for 1.2% of the total U.S. mobile ad market, and just 4% of the total growth in U.S. digital advertising.Even with strong competition, Facebook and Google continue to dominate the market as users flock to their services. The trends favor both to continue growing faster than the rest of the industry for the foreseeable future, too.10 stocks we like better than FacebookWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

IBM Watson Health Inks Deal with MedyMatch for Healthcare AI;3/17/2017;"makeZacksArticleAd();International Business Machines CorporationIBMowned Watson Health has recently inked a five-year agreement with MedyMatch, an artificial intelligence (AI) startup based in Israel. The objective of the deal is to integrate MedyMatch's AI technology with Watson Health for enhanced detection of bleeding in the brain as a result of stroke or head trauma.Initially, IBM Watson Health will launch the MedyMatch brain bleeding detection application globally. Later, the two companies will proceed toward integrating and achieving interoperability between IBM Watson Health's imaging offerings and MedyMatch's AI application.Reportedly, IBM will incur several millions of dollars as recurring annual licensing fees to MedyMatch over the span of the agreement.Notably, shares of IBM have underperformed the ZacksComputer - Integrated Systemsindustry over the last one year. While the industry gained a modest 24.3%, the stock appreciated only 20.5%.The underperformance of the stock could be due to the time consuming transition to the cloud, weakness in traditional businesses and lower IT spending worldwide. However, we expect the stock to rebound given such strategic deals.What Does This Mean for IBM?As per a report by the World Health Organization, nearly 7.6 million people are likely to be affected by stroke by 2030. As per another report by Zion Market Research, worldwide spending on global stroke diagnostics and therapeutics is estimated to reach $31 billion by 2021 at a CAGR of 7%.There is thus a huge scope for application of IBM's cognitive technology as it helps in detecting bleeding in the brain as a result of stroke or trauma.We note that Watson Health has been fast gaining traction in the recent times. Earlier this month, the company launched IBM Watson Imaging Clinical Review, a cognitive imaging offering, at the Health IT Conference for 2017 to address various cardiovascular diseases. (Read More:IBM Watson Introduces Cognitive Imaging to Boost Healthcare).Also, earlier this year, IBM Watson Health partnered with the FDA to advance cancer research. (Read More :IBM Watson Health, FDA Partner to Further Cancer Research).Although competition is intensifying in the cognitive healthcare solutions space with the presence of major players such as Alphabet'sGOOGLDeepmind Health and Microsoft'sMSFTHealthcare NExT, strategic partnerships such as these are expected to further strengthen IBM's  position in the long run. Also, Watson Health's recent partnership with FDA over cancer research augurs well for the company in the long run.International Business Machines Corporation Price and ConsensusInternational Business Machines Corporation Price and Consensus|International Business Machines Corporation QuoteZacks RankAt present, IBM carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the broader technology space is Fortinet, Inc.FTNT, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Microsoft Is Making Those Annoying Windows Updates a Thing of the Past;3/17/2017;"For decades, owning a PC meant putting up with inconvenient   Windows updates that always seemed to take over your computer   when you needed it most. The updates were necessary as they   delivered security patches along with feature updates, but they   were time-consuming and users had no control over when they   happened. The update process was one thatMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) created in the days it dominated the computer   market, before it had to worry about competing with Android   tablets, Chromebooks, iPads, and iPhones.Now, users have more choices for computing and Microsoft CEO   Satya Nadella has changed how his company operates. The CEO, who   took over in early 2014, has pushed out the old monopoly   mentality and has instead created a new Microsoft that listens to   what its consumers want.One of the biggest things the company's customers told it they   wanted was an end to unexpected updates tying up their computer   at inopportune times. Microsoft has listened and starting with   the upcoming Windows 10 Creators update, some major changes are   being made to how Windows 10 gets updated.makeArticleAd();Windows 10 started out user-friendly as it brought back the     well-liked start menu. Image source: Microsoft.What is Microsoft doing?""Prior to the Creators Update, Windows 10 made most of the   decisions for you regarding when updates would be   installed and didn't provide ways to tailor the timing to   your specific needs,"" wrote Windows Service and Delivery Group   Program Management Director John Cable in ablog post. ""What we heard back most explicitly was that you want more   control over when Windows 10 installs updates. We also heard that   unexpected reboots are disruptive if they happen at the wrong   time.""The Creators Update changes that by offering Windows 10 users   three choices. The first option, which the company recommends   because it will give users the latest security features in a   timely fashion, is simply accepting the update when it's   available. The second choice ""Pick a Time,"" lets the user select   when he or she wants the update with the ability to reschedule if   the selected time is no longer convenient when it arrives. The   third option, ""Snooze,"" simply delays the update for three   days.""In addition, we are widening the 'Active Hours' time so   Windows doesn't install an update at times when you want your   device to be ready to use,"" wrote Cable, who also explained that   the company has created a new tool designed to help people keep   track of where their device stands. ""If you decide to exercise   more control over the update process, we've added a new icon to   the Windows Update Settings page that makes it easier to verify   that your device is up to date.""Here's what users will see when an update becomes available.     Image source: Microsoft.Why is this a big step for Microsoft?Under Nadella, Microsoft has become a more consumer-friendly   company and this change removes a pain point that annoyed a lot   of people. It's a smart effort that's in line with how the   Windows maker has been operating under its CEO.It may seem like a small thing, but it shows that Microsoft   has changed its culture in a way that other former monopolies --   the cable companies specifically -- have struggled to do. Windows   users now have options and keeping them from choosing Android,   Chrome, or iOS devices requires listening to what they want.This change will ultimately result in more people being happy   with Windows. That's incredibly important for Microsoft because   its operating system serves as a gateway to Office, Skype, Teams,   and the rest of its software products. All of those services are   available on other platforms, but it's an easy path from using   Windows to becoming immersed in the Microsoft ecosystem and   buying, or more likely subscribing to, multiple programs from the   company.10 stocks we like better than MicrosoftWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

The Digital Content NewFronts, founded by AOL, DigitalLBi, Google, YouTube, Yahoo, Hulu and MicrosoftMSFTin 2012, is an annual event to promote partnership among brands and digital content providers. Management will give a detailed presentation on May 1, 2017 in New York City.Twitter has been aggressively promoting live video to battle sluggish user growth. Online video is the most lucrative component of digital advertising.Consequently, Twitter is trying to bring more video content to attract ad dollars. Ad revenues contribute the lion's share of its total revenue. It intends to capture the opportunity presented by ever increasing video viewing on social media platforms.The company has been signing live streaming deals with several companies. Last year, Twitter signed live streaming deals with Bloomberg, PBS NewsHour and BuzzFeed as well as sports organizations like  NBA, MBL, NFL,  Not just Twitter, given the ad revenue potential, all social media companies right from FacebookFBto Snapchat are pumping huge resources to increase live video viewing on their platform.Twitter, Inc. PriceTwitter, Inc. Price|Twitter, Inc. QuoteAlso, to make the viewing experience better, Twitter has enabled live video broadcasting from its app just via a tweet. Notably, Twitter users earlier required Periscope for creating and broadcasting videos.Per Twitter, in the fourth quarter of 2016, the company streamed 600 hours of live premium videos across 400 events involving 31 million unique viewers. As much as 33% of the viewers of the live video streaming were from outside the U.S., among which 50% were below the 25 years of age.Currently Twitter carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Over the past one year, shares of Twitter are down 9.85% compared with 8.49% growth in the Zacks categorizedInternet Services' industry.Twitter investors have been losing patience and one can hardly blame them. The company has been witnessing sluggish user expansion and revenues have grown just 1% year over year in the recently reported quarter.

"Google Eyes Algorithm Enhancement, Flags ""Offensive"" Content";3/17/2017;"makeZacksArticleAd();Alphabet Inc.'sGOOGLGoogle is reportedly taking steps to spot potentially upsetting or offensive content and reduce their appearance on the search results page. This will result in more accurate, realistic and truthful information for users.Guidelines Updated With a New SectionGoogle uses around 10,000 contractors across the world as quality raters of its search results. The company has added the option of flagging ""Upsetting-Offensive"" content in its guidelines to these quality raters.They now can now flag content that promotes harmful activities such as discrimination or violence against any group of people, animal cruelty, child abuse, racial slurs or human trafficking. Basically any hurtful or displeasing content may be flagged depending upon the motive of a search.The Broader Plan of Algorithm EnhancementData from quality raters will be used to train human coders (search algorithm writers) as well as update machine learning system on how to differentiate upsetting and offensive content from factual and appropriate ones.The broader aim is to make search algorithms capable of automatically flagging such content. This can happen if the algorithms better understand the motive of a particular search and display results accordingly.However, that doesn't necessarily mean that that an offensive or upsetting content will not appear on the search results page. Rather, the enhanced search algorithm will display results if it finds an explicit search being made for such content.We believe that Google's near-monopoly position in the search market is likely to drive Alphabet's stock price going ahead. Its shares have appreciated 15.2% in the last one year compared with the ZacksInternet-Servicesindustry'sgain of 11.6%.Our TakeWe believe that updates of this kind will improve Google's search quality and furnish quality results.

3 IBM Moonshots Shareholders Should Know About;3/16/2017;"Who knew that a company as big and well-known asIBM(NYSE: IBM) could become a battleground stock? In the span of a   day, two sell-side analysts gave two starkly different takes on   the company. Jefferies analyst James Kisner reiterated his   underperform rating on the company, with a price target of $125,   while Drexel Hamilton analyst Brian White raised his target to an   outperform and a whopping $215. The stock currently trades near   the midpoint of the two, at $180 per share and 14.5 times   earnings. This seems to be par for the course for IBM, with   investing greats such as Warren Buffett and Stanley Druckenmiller   taking similarly divergent stances, with Buffett long and   Druckenmiller short.The divergence seems to be on the topic of IBM's ""moonshot""   bets. Most know the company has had declining revenues for   roughly 19 straight quarters, though some of the decline came   from the the company divesting unprofitable business units, such   as semiconductor manufacturing. In addition, even its existing   cash cows are declining as well, as the company was late to the   cloud-computing game, now dominated byAmazon.comandMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) . This is the crux of the bears' case.IBM is not standing still, however; it has been aggressively   investing in new technologies and buying companies in ""bolt-on""   acquisitions around these new bets. One need to look no further   than the recent numbers from the U.S. Patent and Trademark   Office, which show that IBM was granted the most patents in the   U.S. in 2016...for the 24th year in a row. It's clear that   pioneering new technologies is part of the company's DNA, and   bulls have faith that some, or maybe all, of these new bets could   lead to big payoffs in the future. Three big bets to watch out   for are Watson, blockchain, and quantum computing.makeArticleAd();Image source: Getty Images.WatsonOne could say that Watson is the most mature of the big bets,   though it is difficult to get a grasp on how much revenue the   segment generates. The unit is grouped within the ""strategic   imperatives"" unit of the company, which exceeded $32 billion and   made up more than 40% of the company's revenue in 2016. Such a   contribution to revenues was ahead of schedule, according to CEO   Ginni Rometty.Many first got to know Watson in 2011, when it beat a couple   of us ""humans"" onJeopardy!in 2011, showing America that artificial intelligence was not   just the stuff of Stanley Kubrick movies anymore.Since then, IBM has developed Watson by purchasing companies   such as Truven Health Analytics for healthcare, Promontory   Financial Group for financial services regulation, and The   Weather Company for (you guessed it) weather, specifically for   applications for the Internet of Things. With these acquisitions,   the company claims, it is obtaining valuable industry data that   is not public, plus the best practices and expertise that come   from the employees of these companies.IBM has a plan to differentiate Watson from all of the other   AI platforms out there. Rometty explained that 80% of all data is   non-public , which means that those who own the data -- the   companies that collect it -- value it highly. IBM is promising   these companies that in exchange for feeding their data into   Watson, IBM will let them keep their insights private.According to Rometty at Monday'sinvestor presentation, Watson will touch a billion people by the end of this year. She   also threw out a $2 trillion number -- that's with a ""t"" -- as   the market for enhanced decision-making via machine learning.   There have certainly been a lot of Watson-related headlines these   days, with new partnerships withH&R Block(NYSE: HRB) , which is using financial-industry data for its   clients;salesforce.com(NYSE: CRM) , which noted that its partnership was to make   partial use of Watson's weather-related insights for insurance   clients; and the Health Transformation Alliance, a nonprofit   alliance of twenty large American employers, which will use   Watson to help bring down the consortium's healthcare costs.BlockchainWhile many had Bitcoin fever a few years ago when the digital   currency made waves on the internet, IBM saw potential in its   underlying technology, called the blockchain.As featured in arecentNew York Timesarticle, IBM is working withWal-Mart(NYSE: WMT) , Danish companyMaersk(NASDAQOTH: AMKBF) , and almost four hundred other companies in   testing out this implementation of the technology.Blockchain uses high-powered computers and advanced math to   note transactions between two parties, and does so in a way that   makes alteration of the records after the fact impossible. As one   can imagine, IBM is looking to implement this for financial   institutions in recording trades. But companies that ship   products around the world like Wal-Mart and Maersk can benefit,   too. According to the article, when these companies ship   containers, each container may require up to thirty approvals   from various inspectors and customs officials. The system is also   prone to fraud. A successful implementation of blockchain   technology could help with that, leading to large savings for   these shipping companies.One thing to watch out for, says the article, is that some   large companies are reluctant to make IBM Blockchain the de facto   standard, as it might lock them into IBM's ecosystem.JPMorgan Chase(NYSE: JPM) , for instance, is working with Microsoft on its own   blockchain technology called Ethereum.Quantum computingPerhaps the most far-out moonshot -- in terms of both time and   coolness -- is IBM's foray into quantum computing. Quantum   computers can process information that regular computers can't.   Whereas the most powerful computers today can come up with   solutions based on currently available data (a feat in itself),   quantum computers can theoretically solve problems for which   there are no patterns in the data, and the possibilities to   explore are too numerous for even the fastest ""regular   computers.""Whoa.How is this possible? According tofuturism.com:This increase in speed is made possible through the use of     quantum bits (or qubits) instead of the binary bits that     current computers employ. Qubits rely on the quantum phenomenon     of superposition, which allows them to be 0s or 1s at the same     time. This ability to exist in multiple states at once enables     qubits to process information more quickly.Everybody got that? Me neither. In fact, even IBM doesn't have   all the answers. That is why it is opening up a project calledIBM Q, which will enlist anyone interested in the field to contribute   code and research, as open source.The company opened up a 5-qubit system in May, but one day   hopes to build the world's first quantum computer with 50 qubits,   which will help solve problems in medicine, material science, and   finance. What's even more exciting is that, according to IBM vice   president of science and solutions Dario Gil, ""no one is entirely   sure of the full breadth of what a universal quantum computer is   capable of.""Apparently, the same goes for analysts and investors when   assessing Big Blue.10 stocks we like better than IBMWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Better Buy: Intel Corporation vs. NVIDIA;3/16/2017;"Intel(NASDAQ: INTC) andNVIDIA(NASDAQ: NVDA) are titans of the same semiconductor industry,   born a generation apart. As in all human endeavors, the only   constant in business is change, and Intel and NVIDIA find   themselves today at different stages of their corporate life   cycles.Thanks to coming adoption of technologies such as self-driving   cars and artificial-intelligence (AI) software, NVIDIA has seen   demand for its graphics chips move from a niche into the   mainstream. On the other hand, Intel roared to global dominance   during the rise of PCs and mainframe servers, but it has   struggled to tap into more recent growth markets such as mobile   computing, deep learning, and the like.So which is the better stock for you to buy today: Intel or   NVIDIA? Let's examine three different aspects for NVIDIA and   Intel to determine which companies' shares appear more attractive   today.makeArticleAd();Financial fortitudeThose same life-cycle differences reveal themselves in   assessing the financial strength of NVIDIA and Intel. Look at   these four important metrics of liquidity and solvency for both   companies.CompanyCash and InvestmentsDebtCash From OperationsCurrent RatioNVIDIA$6.8 billion$2.8 billion$1.7 billion4.7Intel$14.9 billion$25.2 billion$21.8 billion1.7Data sources: NVIDA and Intel investor relations; Yahoo!   Finance.NVIDIA easily beats Intel in terms of near-term liquidity --   as evidenced by its current ratio -- and in terms of net debt,   which is just a fancy accounting term for cash and equivalents   minus debt. That being said, Intel's cash flow-generation   capabilities are staggering. Though $18.4 billion of its debt   will mature in 2022 or later, Intel could easily erase the   majority of its leverage in a single year, even after subtracting   the $9.6 billion it spent on capital expenditures in 2016.Intel is also an example of a company that uses debt, or a   leveraged capital structure, as a source of competitive   advantage. It's one of the few semiconductor companies that also   owns its chip fabrication plants; NVIDIA outsources its fab to a   consortium of partners includingTaiwan Semiconductor,Samsung, and more. Operating large fixed assets such as   semiconductor manufacturing plants requires plenty of capital,   which explains Intel's use of ample leverage. Either way, both   companies are in fine financial shape, given their respective   strategies, so let's call this one a tie and move on.Winner: Tie.Image source: Getty Images.Durable competitive advantagesNVIDIA and Intel each enjoy meaningful competitive advantages   in their respective areas of the global semiconductor market.Sources estimate Intel controls 87% of the PC CPU market and   95% the server CPU market, although the exact numbers aren't as   important as knowing that Intel dominates the global PC and data   center microprocessor markets, and for a predictable reason:   Intel's longtime performance advantage over the competition --   namely,Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD)  -- has allowed the company to charge higher   prices per unit for its chips.Intel plows an aggressive portion of its profits back into its   research and development, which has, in turn, allowed it to   maintain the performance advantages of its chips. Barring   execution risks, which have been a concern fromtime to time, this long-standing trend has served as a virtuous cycle that   has allowed Intel to dominate its core markets and consistently   produce above-average profits for its shareholders.The dollar values involved help flesh this dynamic out a bit   more. In the past three years, AMD's revenue has totaled $4.2   billion in 2016, $3.9 billion in 2015, and $5.5 billion in   2014. In contrast, Intel's research-and-development budgetalonehas totaled $12.7 billion, $12.1 billion, and $11.5 billion over   the same period. This kind of structural advantage is   incredibly difficult to overcome.NVIDIA's competitive advantages are more technological than   structural at the moment. Because of its long-standing place as   the creator graphics computing, on which it still focuses,   NVIDIA's chips have generally been the best of breed in each of   the graphics processing applications its products serve. The   company pressed that advantage with last year's debut of its   Pascal architecture, around which it launched a number of new   chips.Better still, NVIDIA has used its advantage to help   consolidate early leads in core growth markets such as AI   computing platforms and driverless cars. In recent years, NVIDIA   has become the GPU supplier to the AI efforts atMicrosoft,Facebook,Amazon.com,Alphabet, andApple,to name a few. Much has also been made of NVIDIA's potential in   self-driving cars, where it supplies the graphics chips that   power the autonomous-vehicle efforts ofFord,Tesla,Volkswagen,Honda, and many more. Both of these industries figure to offer   substantial growth opportunities over the coming decade, and   NVIDIA's place as the go-to supplier to support these emerging   technologies speaks to their compelling value proposition.Winner: NVIDIA.ValuationThe way the market is pricing Intel and NVIDIA shares should   come as little surprise, given what we just learned about the   outlook for their businesses. Here's a snapshot of three of the   most commonly used valuation metrics for Intel and NVIDIA.CompanyP/EForward P/EEV/EBITDANVIDIA38.329.523.6Intel16.912.37.8Data source: Yahoo! Finance.Both companies also pay dividends: Intel shares currently   yield 2.9%; NVIDIA, a mere 0.5%.As for which stock appears the more attractively valued, I   think both companies appear reasonably valued, given their   respective growth outlooks. The multiple trends fueling NVIDIA's   growth should support its earnings growth for arguably a decade   or more, so its sky-high valuation shouldn't be a deterrent for   investors with a similarly long time horizon.As more of a mature company, Intel will have its investment   outlook driven by its ability to grow its EPS and return excess   capital to shareholders. Its fantastic economics should allow it   to do so, but it's hard to get excited about a company that   analysts see growing sales just 0.9% this year and 2% in   2018. So in terms of which company is more appropriately   valued, I think both companies trade near prices that seem   fair.Winner: Tie.And the winner is... NVIDIA by a noseBoth companies present interesting value propositions to   investors today. Intel offers a mix of profitability and income   at a fairly discounted price, which could prove compelling to   more conservative investors. However, many of NVIDIA's growth   markets are in their early stages, which makes it the more   attractive stock to own over the long term.10 stocks we like better than IntelWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Adobe Systems Incorporated (ADBE) Stock Soars on Earnings Beat;3/16/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsI argued coming intoAdobe Systems Incorporated(NASDAQ:ADBE) earnings that there wasno reason to bet against Adobe stock. Adobe earnings had come in ahead of consensus for four straight quarters. Adobe stock had quadrupled in less than five years. As the old saw goes, ""The trend is your friend."" Clearly, that trend was in favor of ADBE.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockFor a fifth straight quarter, Adobe earnings came in ahead of analyst estimates. Non-GAAP earnings of 94 cents per share beat the Street by seven cents. Nearly 22% revenue growth was two points ahead of consensus.ADBE stock is up roughly 4% in after-hours trading, after yet another quarter that seems to support the long-term bull case for Adobe stock.Adobe Earnings: The Fifth Straight BeatAdobe's fiscal first-quarter earnings were even more impressive than past beats. On average, Adobe earnings had come in about 4% above consensus the past few quarters; in Q1 FY17, Adobe beat by a solid 8%.7 Dividend Stocks With Yields That Grow Like WeedsBeyond the numbers, the news was good - and broad-based. Digital Media Annualized Recurring Revenue (ARR), a key measure of the company's success in ""cloud,"" hit $4.25 billion, up nearly 7% simply in the first three months. Marketing Cloud revenue of $477 million was up over 26% year-over-year, actually accelerating from prior-year growth of 21%. Non-GAAP operating income increased 42%, and non-GAAP net income rose 40%.As CFO Mark Garrett pointed out in the Q1 release, ""Adobe achieved record revenue, profit and cash flow"" in the quarter.All told, the Adobe earnings report was a blowout by any measure.What Earnings Mean for Adobe StockHeading into the quarter, it seemed likely that ARR, in particular, would be a focus of investors. That figure is moving to a larger and larger share of overall revenue: now about 70% on a trailing twelve-month basis. The ability to continue torrid growth even on a base that size - and without simply taking revenue away from legacy product sales, likeMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) does with Office - seems likely to support Adobe stock in trading on Friday.The second area of focus is in the Marketing Cloud business. Adobe obviously has little competition for Acrobat or Photoshop. In marketing, however, the competitive landscape is very different. Adobe is going up against giants such assalesforce.com, inc.(NYSE:CRM),Oracle Corporation(NYSE:ORCL) andInternational Business Machines Corp.(NYSE:IBM).Clearly, Adobe is winning. The nearly 27% revenue growth in that business seems likely to be a major facet of the narrative coming out of Adobe earnings. The marketing business is the one segment where Adobe has true upside: in most of the Creative Media business, for instance, the company's dominance is such that eventually its growth rate will slow to that of the market as a whole.Marketing, however, presents a multi-billion-dollar opportunity with literally worldwide potential. And the fact that Adobe is not only surviving, but thriving while fighting some of the largest tech companies in the world has to boost the case for Adobe stock.Bottom Line on ADBE StockAll told, the Adobe earnings surprise should be no surprise. This is a company firing on all cylinders, with substantial market opportunities in front of it. I'd be surprised to see the market shrug off the Q1 beat as something already incorporated into Adobe's stock price. The size of the earnings beat, the strength in cloud, and the performance in the Marketing Cloud segment all point to a stock that should rise in trading on Friday.And Q1 supports the bull case here. Adobe stock isn't cheap - but it's hardly expensive. FY18 analyst estimates likely will be boosted moderately after the strong Q1 FY17 performance.Why Snap Inc (SNAP) Stock Could Soon RallyAs they near $5, ADBE stock trades at about 23 times FY18 earnings plus cash. In a market where many lesser companies are receiving similar multiples, that hardly seems excessive. And it seems to leave more room for Adobe stock to run.Again, ""the trend is your friend."" And Adobe earnings in Q1 show that the trend should stay positive for some time to come.As of this writing, Vince Martin did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace7 IPOs That Were Done the Right Way6 Tech Stocks to Buy for the VR BoomThe postAdobe Systems Incorporated (ADBE) Stock Soars on Earnings Beatappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Oracle (ORCL) Stock Spikes on Impressive Q3 Earnings and Cloud Revenues;3/16/2017;"Oracle CorporationORCLis up 7% at $45.94 per share in midday trading on Thursday after posting impressive third quarter earnings yesterday, beating both the Zacks Consensus earnings and revenues estimates.  (To learn more about Oracle's Q3 Earnings, check out this Zacks article:Oracle (ORCL) Beats on Q3 Earnings & Revenues: Stock Up)The California-based company is one of the world's leading suppliers of software for information management and is a new participant in the cloud software service, which is dominated by Amazon.comAMZN, while International Business MachinesIBM, MicrosoftMSFTand GoogleGOOGLare becoming notable competitors.Oracle on Wednesday reported cloud software revenues of $1.1 billion, up 85% compared to the same period a year ago and total revenues were $9.3 billion, up 3%. In dollars, the cloud business grew by almost $500 million year-over-year while the total revenues grew $260 million.The software company's new cloud-computing service has been offsetting the revenue decline in the company's long-time software-licensing operations. Revenues from new software licenses saw a $266 million decline, a 16% fall from a year earlier.""Both our SaaS and PaaS business are doing great, I'm even more excited about our second generation IaaS business,"" said Oracle co-founder and Chief Technology Officer, Larry Ellison. ""Our new Gen2 IaaS is both faster and lower cost than Amazon Web Services.""There is no doubt that Oracle has been investing money to ensure their products and services are in the best shape to compete against powerhouses like Amazon. The operating expenses in cloud software as a service and platform as a service went up by 25% while $4.5 billion were put into research and development for the reported quarter.Despite the impressive growth in its cloud software sector, Oracle is still nowhere near Amazon, who dominates the cloud spaceowning 40% of the cloud market share. However, in February, Oracle altered the terms of its licensing policy to double the cost of running its software in Amazon's cloud environment, reported byMarket Realist.With this move, Oracle took away one of Amazon's cloud service's main selling points, which is the cheaper route to the cloud and presented its own cloud platform as the cheaper option.Oracle reported earnings of $0.63 per share and revenues of $9.27 billion. The company's Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.19 per share of outstanding common stock, up 27% from the current quarterly dividend of $0.15.Oracle expects the fourth quarter of 2017 to be another strong quarter. The cloud software revenue, including SaaS/PaaS and IaaS, with software license and software support is expected to grow 1-3%.Oracle is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) with a Style Score ""A"" in Momentum.More Stock News: 8 Companies Verge on Apple-Like   RunDid you miss Apple's 9X stock explosion after they launched their iPhone in 2007?

The Zacks Rank looks at all the earnings estimate revisions and looks for the strongest moves.  Check back in a day or two to see if ORCL can move up on Zacks Rank thanks to this quarter.ORCL In A Tech Portfolio?The quarter was a good one and we are seeing higher price targets and at least one upgrade.  That said, the dividend increase makes me think that this stock wants to be more of a value play that what most investors think of when they search for 'top tech stocks' or something similar.  Yes, ORCL has a spot in tech as a benchmark name, but I want something more from the tech stocks that I put in my portfolio.This would be a name you would put cash into as a placeholder instead of just having cash.  Over the last year, this stock has traded in a range between $39 and $42.  With a breakout over $46 we could be setting up for a solid drift higher into the next report, but I would be surprised to see it reach $50 anytime soon.Oracle Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseOracle Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise|Oracle Corporation QuoteWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Is Qualcomm, Inc. (QCOM) Stock Stuck In a Bear Trap?;3/16/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsQualcomm, Inc.(NASDAQ:QCOM) is really a victim of its own amazing success. Since the mid-1980s, the company has been able to develop cutting-edge mobile technologies that have defined the industry. The result is that the profits have been standout. Yet this has caught the ire of customers and even governments. The claim: QCOM is really a monopolist that is willing to leverage its unfair power.makeArticleAd();Source:Karlis Dambrans via FlickrThis has happened to other tech titans through history, of course.Just some of the examples includeMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT),AT&T Inc.(NYSE:T) andInternational Business Machines Corp.(NYSE:IBM). The problem is that - even when they resolved their legal disputes and antitrust actions - the companies suffered a prolonged period of stagnation and sub-par investor returns.Unfortunately, I think the same could be the case with Qualcomm stock. Already the returns have been lackluster. For the last five years, QCOM stock has posted a miserable 11% loss.QCOM Stock's WoesThen again, the company must deal with a host of massive legal actions. While one was settled, which included a $975 million payment to the Chinese antitrust authorities, there are currently active suits in the U.S., Europe and Korea, which recently filed a claim for $873 million. Then of course, there is the $1 billion suit fromApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL).And yes, the core legal claim is that the practices of QCOM are inherently anti-competitive and unfair. After all, when the company charges a royalty, it is not a fixed amount per unit, but instead a percentage of the price of the device.7 Blue-Chip Stocks Holding You BackAccording toAAPL CEO Tim Cook:""They were insisting on charging royalties for technologies that they had nothing to do with. And so we were in a situation where the more we innovated with unique features like touch ID or advanced displays or cameras, just to name a few, the more money Qualcomm would collect for no reason, and the more expensive it would be for us to innovate. So, it's somewhat like buying a sofa and you charge somebody a different price depending upon the price of the house that it goes into, just from our point of view, this doesn't make sense and we don't believe it will pass muster in the courts.""Interestingly enough, the potential monetary damages are almost trivial. QCOM has a cash hoard of $10.8 billion and a market cap of $86 billion.The real issue then? Well, for Qualcomm stock, it's the threat to the business model. According to the mostrecent 10-K, the licensing business generated a juicy $6.5 billion in pre-tax earnings last year, compared to $2.2 billion for the rest of the other operations.In other words, if the licensing arrangements are deemed to be unfair and anti-competitive, then the ramifications could be far-reaching. It would strike a dagger straight into the cash machine. So given this, is it any wonder that QCOM stock has been such a terrible investment?Of course not.Now it's true that there are still some bullish factors at work with Qualcomm stock. The company has made some key strategic investments with its chip technologies, which should open up profitable opportunities with desktops and data centers. To make this happen, QCOM has a major partnership with MSFT to use Snapdragon 835 processors for the Windows 10 platform.There are also some other compelling growth opportunities, such as with market for autos and the Internet of Things. In fact, the company has made a huge wager on this opportunity with the proposed $47 billion acquisition ofNXP Semiconductors NV(NASDAQ:NXPI), which is the world's fifth-largest non-memory semiconductor supplier and it has a large chunk of key markets for in-vehicle systems, secure identification, near field communication technology and digital networking.Does the Snap Inc (SNAP) Debacle Signal Doom for These Unicorns?Oh, and Qualcomm stock is trading a very reasonable valuation. Note that the forward price-to-earnings ratio is only 12X.Bottom Line on Qualcomm StockBut this may not matter much. A large-cap tech company can languish for quite a while, especially when there remains uncertainty. And again, with QCOM stock, the problem is that its business model is under relentless attack. In the meantime, the growth rate for smartphones has decelerated over years as markets have become saturated.So in light of all this, Qualcomm stock really looks more like a bear trap, not an interesting value opportunity.Tom Taulli runs the InvestorPlace blogIPO Playbookand is the author of various books, includingTaxes 2017: Saving A Bundle.Follow him on Twitter at@ttaulli.

Service Provider Router Revenues Thrive Worldwide in 2016;3/15/2017;"According to a recent report by Dell'Oro, the service provider router and carrier Ethernet switch industry has witnessed a successful 2016 primarily attributed to strong demand from cloud service providers. This happened despite the fact that the traditional telecom operators trimmed network spending at least for the near-term.Routers are telecom infrastructure devices used to deliver data packets from one network to another. These are located at gateways, the places where two or more networks connect. In 2016, the aggregate market size of service provider router and carrier Ethernet switch was more than $13 billion.Phenomenal demand for 100 Gbps Ethernet ports was the main driving force for this record breaking revenue achievement. China played a major roll as cloud service providers of this country were busy installing backbone and data center interconnect networks. Several industry analysts have estimated that the global router market will reach around $72 -- $73 billion by 2022.Massive growth in the usage of mobile devices has heightened transportation of data traffic substantially. In order to manage this burgeoning demand for photo, video and online data services, telecom operators are required to install more routers to ensure smooth transfer of data packets.In the U.S., majority of demand for service provider router and carrier Ethernet switch are from large cloud service operators like Amazon Web Services of Amazon.com Inc.AMZN, Microsoft Azure of Microsoft Corp.MSFTand Alphabet Inc.GOOGL. All three stocks currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Tech Roundup: GOOGL, MSFT, QCOM, HPE and More;3/15/2017;"Alphabet'sGOOGLCloud Next announcements were huge, but didn't dwarf the other big news involving MicrosoftMSFTusing QualcommQCOMchips in its servers, or Hewlett Packard EnterpriseHPEbuying NimbleNMBLor the CIA's alleged hacking.Here are the top stories from last week:Google Cloud NextAt its Cloud Next conference in California last week, Google demonstrated that it finally has a big growth engine that isn't driven by the search services it is identified with. The cloud strategy has been unfolding over the past few years for both Microsoft and Google. But the companies have taken different approaches based on their existing strengths and weaknesses. In Google's case, its intentions became clear when it hired VMware founder Dianne Greene roughly 16 months ago.Greene has clearly worked to form, bringing in asteady flow of big clientsincluding Walt Disney, Home Depot, Apple and Snap. At the conference, Google announced HSBC, eBayEBAY, Colgate Palmolive and Verizon indicating the growing confidence in its platform.Google also announced a bigcollaboration with SAPthat will bring its enterprise applications to the Google Cloud Platform (GCP). This will benefit customers in many ways, giving them access to real-time insights based on big data and offload more complex tasks to GCP when constrained for memory. Within a couple of months, SAP will make its own cloud run on GCP and soon start offering G Suite products including Gmail and Google Calendar to its own customer base of more than 345,000 companies, including most of the world's top 2,000 firms.There were also some newenterprise-focused Google Drive toolsincluding Team Drives (allowing administrators to create, add and delete team members and assign permissions to them within a shared space that will retain shared files even when members change); Google Vault for Drive (that stores data on Google Drive for companies to export, search, hold and retain as required); Drive File Stream (already available for early adopters, this allows you to work directly with files on Drive using applications like Microsoft Word and Adobe Photoshop, which updates the changes automatically to Drive for access from any of your devices later); and Quick Access with Team Drives (that uses artificial intelligence based on an analysis of activity, interactions between colleagues, and workday patterns to serve the most relevant Google Drive files at any given time.And that's not all: Hangouts also got an enterprise version calledHangouts Chatthat could help with corporate communications.As far as acquisitions are concerned, the company announced a couple: AppBridge, which has a tool of the same name to facilitate migration of data (along with file permissions) from other storage solutions whether it's on-premise devices, cloud services, or hybrid solutions to Google Drive. The second was Kaggle, which hosts data and facilitates machine learning contests.Wintel Weakens Further as Microsoft Demonstrates Qualcomm   SoCAt the Open Compute Project (OCP) conference last week, Microsoft was finally able to demonstrate a Windows server using the Qualcomm Centriq 2400, a 64-bit ARM-compatible server-grade 10nm system-on-chip. Centriq also works with accelerators, multi-host NICs, and storage technologies for workload optimization. The product is part of Project Olympus, Microsoft's next-generation hyperscale cloud hardware design. To demonstrate its commitment to the project and open source in general, Qualcomm also joined Facebook'sFBOCP Foundation as a gold member.For the time being, Microsoft says it will use the server internally, but it's not a big stretch to see this as a trial run for broader deployment to serve its cloud customers. Microsoft is also working with Cavium's ThunderX2 64-bit ARMv8 server chipset and AMD Naples server processor in order to identify the best fit and the best value proposition in different situations. A suitable second-source to IntelINTCmay lower costs for players, especially in an open source environment.Cost reduction is the most important consideration at the moment because of the huge amount of data that must be made available for machine learning applications and better web ad targeting. That data is in addition to the amount generated from corporate workloads continuing to shift to the cloud.If ARM designs are to make inroads into the server market, the best place to start is not the enterprise (where compute power is a bigger requirement) but the cloud where less complex operations are required to be carried out at a faster pace. And that's exactly why ARM-based chips from a range of suppliers have been fighting for a toe hold.Intel hasn't yet been displaced as the performance-per-watt and performance-per-dollar leader, which gives it tremendous leverage to hang on to its nearly 100% market share. It can be said with reasonably certainty that displacing Intel entirely won't be easy because most of the related software is written for its x86 designs and few companies have their own software stacks making the shift to ARM designs cost prohibitive.Key Comments-Microsoft Azure's Leendert van Doorn:""We found that [ARM servers] provide the most value for our cloud services, specifically our internal cloud applications such as search and indexing, storage, databases, big data and machine learning. These workloads all benefit from high-throughput computing,"" and ""But this is for internal use only, and that is an important bit, because we see an opportunity for these class of devices for our own datacenter use, but we don't really see much traction on the enterprise side. We have no plans at this point to produce an enterprise version of Windows Server on ARM.""Anand Chandrasekher, senior vice president of Qualcomm Data Centers: ""We're not interested in felling the giant in one fell swoop… We're going to be chipping away.""Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights & Strategy:""Qualcomm's recently announced Centriq 2400 is billed as the world's first 10nm server processor-based on an instruction set from ARM Holdings. While Intel's Xeon processors are based on a 14nm architecture, we do not yet know Centriq's die size, power, price or performance , so there's no way to empirically compare yet. Also, I am not in the camp of 10nm is always better than 14nm as Intel's 14nm is superior to others with high performance, high-leakage designs. I am looking forward to more Centriq details.""Intel statement:""We operate in a highly competitive market and take all competitors seriously,"" and ""We are confident that Xeon processors will continue to deliver the highest performance and lowest total cost of ownership for our cloud customers. However, we understand the desire of our customers to evaluate other product offerings."" New chips consolidating technology from its Altera and Nervana acquisitions are in the works.HPE Buys NimbleHPE is fattening up, but in a nice way.After splitting away from the client and printer business, CEO Meg Whitman went on to spin out and merge the enterprise services business with Computer Sciences Corp, following that up with the spin off and merger of its software business with U.K.-based Micro Focus International. At one time, Michael Dell indirectly commented on the slimming strategy, saying it wasn't the best way to pursue growth.And now it's apparent that that's not the only thing on Whitman's mind. After snapping up Silicon Graphics, SimpliVity, Cloud Cruiser and Niara, the company has now gone for one of the hottest tech startups called Nimble Storage.HPE will be paying $1.09 billion in a deal expected to close next month. It will also assume or pay off $200 million in unvested equity awards.Nimble broadens HPE's all-flash portfolio for enterprise customers by filling the gap between its 3PAR (StoreServ) high-end arrays and entry-level MSA storage. It also brings on board the industry-leading predictive analytics and management tool InfoSight. Plus, there's Nimble's Cloud Volumes that allow data storage in the public cloud near Amazon AWS and Microsoft Azure data centers, facilitating data portability between AWS and Azure and cloud-based computation.No wonder Whitman says, ""Nimble Storage's portfolio… will help us deliver on our vision of making Hybrid IT simple for our customers.""To further sweeten things, Nimble has said that it currently has more than 10K customers.It's easy to see why Nimble would sell out: the company was growing revenue strongly, but was far from profitability (30% revenue growth for a 41 cent loss in the last quarter). It also got an offer it couldn't refuse. HPE's global distribution strength, strong brand, and enterprise relationships are things that can help it scale.Moreover, Nimble is developing its own hyper converged offering and that is a segment where the really big players are fighting for share. By teaming up with HPE, it may be able to fund the significant investment required (CEO Suresh Vasudevan says: ""We believe that joining forces with HPE enables us to further accelerate the pace of innovation that has been a hallmark of our value proposition to customers"").HPE on the other hand is in an increasingly competitive market with Dell-EMC, Pure Storage, Kaminario, IBM and NetApp. Cisco is another competitor in the hyper converged space. Nimble doesn't just increase its product breadth and increase its analytics capabilities but also brings it greater flexibility to decide its hyper converged strategy. Only time will tell if the hefty price tag it's paying for Nimble will be worth it.CIA Hacking Affects Big Tech CompaniesAppleAAPL, Google, Samsung, Sony, HTC, Microsoft and Facebook users were apparently affected by massive hacking operations of the CIA and other intelligence agencies, according to WikiLeaks, which reported the matter in 7,818 web pages and 943 attachments. The hacking relates to the CIA's Center for Cyber Intelligence between 2013 and 2016. The NSA and the UK's GCHQ are also involved. CIA spokesman Heather Fritz Horniak has said, ""We do not comment on the authenticity or content of purported intelligence documents,"" which means that the allegations haven't been confirmed or proved.But the details of the report and the promise of more revelations in the future indicates that there is sufficient reason for concern.The contention is that the CIA discovered, bought or otherwise obtained and exploited security flaws in Android and iOS devices without pointing them out to Apple/Google. As a result, it is thought that some flaws weren't picked up by their internal teams for patching, thus leaving them vulnerable to exploitation. Even encrypted messages on WhatsApp were picked up by the CIA before they could be encrypted. And even Smart TVs were exploited using a technique that indicated the set was off when it was actually on and listening to the conversation in the room.Apple is the only company to have come out and claimed that iOS 10 users weren't affected although it couldn't confirm a similar situation with older versions. At the same time, not all flaws were exposed, so Apple may not be in a position to know for sure. The other companies are looking into the matter.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric   Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

Why Adobe Systems Incorporated (ADBE) Stock Will Keep on Truckin’;3/15/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIt was only a few years ago that investors were wondering whetherAdobe Systems Incorporated(NASDAQ:ADBE) was in a long-term decline. Photoshop and Flash seemed likely to be victims of the shift away from desktop usage. Adobe earnings plunged in FY2013 and declined again in fiscal 2014. ADBE stock looked like dead money.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockAdobe stock looks very different now, however. ADBE has almost quadrupled in the last five years.Photoshop and the company's Document segment overall have flattened out, as predicted. But success in Adobe's Marketing Cloud and Digital Media has led Adobe earnings and ADBE stock steadily higher.There's no reason to expect a change in ADBE stock coming out of the first quarter release, due Thursday. Expectations are high, to be sure. But Adobe earnings have beaten those expectations for four straight quarters. Q1 results seem likely to drive a fifth straight beat.Adobe Earnings: Expect GrowthAgain, expectations are high coming into Adobe earnings for the first quarter. Wall Street consensus suggests a 19% increase in revenue and further expansion in margins. Earnings-per-share are expected to rise 30%, to $0.87 from $0.66.The 7 Best IPOs to Buy for the Rest of 2017But if that seems like a tall order, bear in mind that both are relatively in line with ADBE earnings and sales guidance after Q4. (Analysts are expecting a bit higher revenue growth, with guidance suggesting an ~18% increase.) And of late, Adobe has had no problem beating its guidance - and Street estimates.Both FY15 earnings above $2 and FY16 earnings above $3 (both non-GAAP) exceeded the company's long-term targets laid out after fiscal 2013. In FY16, Adobe earnings beat consensus - handily - in each of the last four quarters, helping drive further gains in ADBE stock.While the absolute growth rates sound high, estimates actually suggest a deceleration from fiscal 2016 results. Revenue increased 22% last year, with EPS rising nearly 50%. With continued cloud adoption boosting both sales and margins, there's little reason to see much of a slowdown in fiscal 2017. That should lead to Q1 numbers looking solid - and likely further gains for Adobe stock.Potential Catalysts for ADBE StockHeadline numbers aside, the Adobe earnings release will have more information on the company's cloud transition. What has been impressive about Adobe is that cloud adoption has driven higher overall sales.Unlike, say,Microsoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT), where cloud versions of Office arejust cannibalizing product sales, ADBE's overall top line is growing. The company's ARR (annualized recurring revenue), a direct measure of strength in cloud services, will be a closely watched metric in Q1.One point of concern on that front might be questions about whether ARR is going to hit a ceiling soon. That figure already represented nearly two-thirds of Adobe revenue in fiscal 2016. If investors worry about potential diminishing returns in that initiative, ADBE stock could struggle coming out of earnings.In addition, Marketing Cloud results will be closely watched, as that's the one area where Adobe isn't a dominant leader. Its Photoshop and Acrobat businesses have little in the way of competition, but cloud-based marketing is a tougher field.Adobe is going against major competition:Salesforce.com, Inc.(NYSE:CRM),Oracle Corporation(NYSE:ORCL) andInternational Business Machines Corp.(NYSE:IBM), among others. If Adobe shows that it's taking further market share in that business, there's really nothing to stop further growth - and further gains for ADBE stock.Finally, operating expenses may be closely watched as well. While margins and earnings have improved steadily, some bears on Adobe stock have pointed to rising spend as a possible problem once revenue growth slows down. For now, those investments in sales and G&A are bearing fruit. But Adobe will need to show disciplined growth.How to Play Adobe Stock Into EarningsI'm not sure ADBE represents an ideal earnings trade. Expectations are high: Cowen & Co. upgraded Adobe stock to a Buy, with a $140 price target just this past Friday. The market might shrug off a modest earnings beat, given the performance over the last two years, in particular.Target Corporation (TGT) Stock Will Keep Sinking Without This ChangeThere's no reason to bet against ADBE stock, however. The nature of the cloud model makes earnings relatively predictable (as a large portion of revenue is under contract). That would seem to leave little room for an earnings miss.From a longer-term perspective, Adobe stock still has more room to run. Valuation isn't that high, with the stock trading around 31x FY17 guidance plus its nearly $4 per share in cash. Against ~25% EPS growth, that valuation is far from ridiculous. A dividend probably is on the way soon (Adobe already is buying back stock).The Marketing Cloud business, in particular, can cement the bull case. A business with 30%+ operating margins and three dominant franchises is always going to get a bid from investors. And Q1 earnings seem likely to only strengthen that case.As of this writing, Vince Martin did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 Monthly Dividend Stocks to Buy to Pay the Bills10 Dangerous Dividend Stocks to Dump NowThe postWhy Adobe Systems Incorporated (ADBE) Stock Will Keep on Truckin'appeared first onInvestorPlace."

The acquisition is expected to boost its AI technology platform targeting enterprises. However, the terms of the deal were not disclosed.We note that the two companies have partnered many times in the past to cater to clients in the financial services and insurance sectors.With this acquisition, Genpact will be able to provide AI offerings across industries such as consumer packaged goods, industrial engineering, life-sciences and high-tech.Genpact Limited Price and ConsensusGenpact Limited Price and Consensus|Genpact Limited QuoteWhy this Move?As per an IDC report, worldwide spending on cognitive systems and AI is estimated to go past $47 billion by 2020 at a CAGR of 55.1%. Given the huge scope the segment has to offer, it is not surprising to see a number of companies flocking to the scene.Apart from IBM'sIBMWatson, Google'sGOOGLDeep Mind, Microsoft'sMSFTCortana and Apple's Siri, there are some rookies in the industry too such as AIBrain, Anki and Entefy that are trying to carve a niche in the segment.With this acquisition, we expect Genpact to better position itself in the enterprise AI space, resulting in greater adoption for its services. Also, the company's thorough domain expertise is a positive, helping it to generate enhanced actionable insights for enterprises.Moreover, Rage Frameworks has a commendable portfolio of 20 ""intelligent machines"", which can streamline an enterprise's business processes such as contract reviews and supply chain cost audits. These will help Genpact to offer customized solutions.Stock Performance OverviewShares of Genpact have largely underperformed the ZacksOutsourcingindustry over the last one year.

Better Buy: Shopify Inc. (U.S.) vs. Veeva Systems Inc.;3/15/2017;"One of the most important terms for forward-looking investors to understand is SaaS. This four-letter term stands for Software-as-a-Service. And companies that have mastered SaaS are becomingverylucrative investments.Perhaps the easiest way to envision this is to remember what it was like -- and still is for some -- to installMicrosoft'sOffice Suite onto their computer. And really, 15 years ago, who could afford to go without the bare minimum of Microsoft Word on their computer?makeArticleAd();The installation process -- using a CD -- was time consuming, and only applied to one device at a time. But now, Microsoft Office 365 allows paying members to access the software via the cloud from any connected device. Another way of thinking of it is on-demand software that you subscribe for.Image source: Getty Images.But there are lots of other examples of such technology, and they are gaining popularity at a breakneck pace.Veeva Systems(NYSE: VEEV) provides cloud solutions that help drug companies do everything from manage their sales force to keep track of FDA clinical tests for the drug approval process.Shopify(NYSE: SHOP) , on the other hand, is an SaaS company that provides a one-stop shop for any entrepreneur or medium-sized business to establish an e-commerce presence.Both stocks have been very successful as of late, but which is the better buy today? That's impossible to answer with 100% certainty, but there are different lenses through which we can examine the question. Here are three of the most relevant and how Shopify and Veeva compare.Sustainable competitive advantagesI wish I could go back in time and explain to my beginning-investor self just how important sustainable competitive advantages are. Often referred to as a ""moat"" by professional investors, this represents the special something that keeps customers coming back month after month, while keeping competitors at bay for decades.The moat for Shopify and Veeva can be described in three short words: high switching costs.Let's put ourselves in the shoes of a typical Veeva customer for a second. You're a medium-sized biotechnology firm. You use Veeva CRM to manage your sales force -- which includes everything from a customer database, to secured email communications.You also use Veeva Vault to capture electronic data that's crucial for your FDA approval, and to make sure that you're abiding by all of the relevant government regulations. It took you weeks to train all of your employees to use and communicate on Veeva's platform. But now that they are familiar with the platform, your company's efficiency has skyrocketed.How much of a headache would it be -- both from an operational and financial standpoint -- to switch to another provider for all of these mission-critical functions? As long as Veeva doesn't start jacking up prices to the point where they are prohibitively expensive, you'd much rather focus your time and energy on your core business mission.The same can be said for Shopify. The company has three different tiers of subscriptions to help you start and maintain your e-commerce presence. Once you reach the highest level, Shopify can help you not only manage your website, but it also offers payment processing and shipping services.Those are big deals, and if your company grew up with Shopify as the platform of choice, you would be equally loathe to switch to a different provider after years of familiarity, data, and training using its products.Both of these companies have very strong moats, but in the end, this is a draw.Winner = TieFinancial fortitudeOne important thing to note is that financial fortitude is especially important for young SaaS companies. It takes enormous up-front investments to set up the infrastructure necessary to become successful in the field. If a company doesn't have a reliable cash stash to act as a safety net, the smallest bit of chaos could wipe the balance sheet clean.Here's how these two companies stack up in terms of financial fortitude.CompanyCashDebtNet IncomeFree Cash FlowShopify$392 million$0($35 million)($10 million)Veeva$346 million$0$54 million$59 millionData source: Yahoo! FinanceI cannot stress enough how important it is that neither Shopify nor Veeva has any long-term debt to speak of. That makes them infinitely healthy.It's worth mentioning that because these companies operate using a subscription-model, there's often a lag between large contracts being signed, and revenue actually being collected.It's also important to point out that while Shopify has yet to be profitable, it should have no problem running its business. With a loss of only $10 million in cash flow over the past year, there's more than enough cash on hand for the business to aggressively reinvest in growth opportunities.But if we're forced to choose a winner here, Veeva has the edge by a nose. Being able to produce free cash flow is a definite bonus, and one that we shouldn't ignore.Winner = VeevaValuationFinally, we have valuation. While this isn't an exact science, there are some straightforward metrics we can consult to give us an idea of how expensive each stock is.CompanyP/EP/FCFP/SShopifyN/AN/A15Veeva6410912Data source: Yahoo! Finance, E*Trade. P/E represents figures from non-GAAP earnings.Because of the aforementioned cash flow and income situation at Shopify, this is a relatively easy category to pick a winner in. Even on the one metric where we do have some apples-to-apples comparison, Shopify appears to be trading at a 25% premium.Though Veeva isn't cheap by any stretch of the imagination, it's profitable -- and thus, easier to measure its relative value.Winner = VeevaThe winner is...So there you have it: Veeva would appear to be the better bet today. The company's profitability gives it a slight edge over Shopify. But to be honest, I think these are two of the most exciting mid-cap stocks to invest in today.Right now, Shopify is purposely spending alittlemore than it brings in via sales -- so analysts just have to accept that it won't be profitable for a while. But in the process, it is capturing massive market share. Combine that market share with high switching costs and all the company would have to do to be profitable is turn off its spending spigot a little bit and income would boom.That's why I ownbothof these stocks in my personal portfolio, and they combine to make up over 5% of my real-life holdings. I think you'd do your future self a huge favor to take a look at both for your own retirement portfolio.10 stocks we like better than Veeva SystemsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Oracle (ORCL) Earnings: Will Cloud Momentum Finally Move the Stock?;3/15/2017;"How much of Oracle’s (ORCL) total revenue will be made up by its Cloud business? Is the database giant exiting its core legacy database business too quickly? And to what extent can the former make up the difference in the company’s bottom line? These are the pressing questions investors will focus on when Oracle reports third quarter fiscal 2017 earnings after the closing Wednesday.The Redwood City, Calif.-based tech giant, which continues to invest more on its transition to the Cloud to offset weak licensing revenues, is expected to report a decline in profits when it reports fiscal third-quarter earnings after the market closes on Wednesday. Oracle CEO Larry Ellison has waged the company’s future on its ability to catch up to or eventually pass the likes of Salesforce.com (CRM) and Microsoft (MSFT).Fresh off its $9.3 billion acquisition of Cloud-software company NetSuite, a deal that passed a shareholder vote in November, Ellison is leaving no stones unturned to get revenue growing back into the ""mid-teens"" area, where analysts will be forced to take the company more seriously. To that end, Wall Street will focus on the company’s licensing businesses, which declined 19% in the second quarter. Any improvement, or a more modest decline, would be well received by investors.makeArticleAd();For the quarter that ended February, analysts on average expect Oracle to report adjusted earnings of 62 cents per share on revenue of $9.22 billion. This compares to the year-ago quarter when earning were 64 cents per share on $9.01 billion in revenue. For the full year, ending May, earnings are projected to be $2.56 per share, down from $2.61 a year ago, while revenue of $37.54 billion would rise 1.3% year over year.How will ORCL stock, which closed Tuesday at $42.79, react to these numbers? The shares have gained about 5% in the past three months and 11.29% over the past year. This compares with a 19% one-year rise for the S&P 500. The stock has a consensus Buy rating and an average analyst 12-month price target of $45, suggesting 5% premium from current levels. While the 5% return from excite investors, Oracle still generates tons of cash flow and is actively buying back shares.And from a valuation perspective, you would be hard-pressed to find a better bargain, risk-averse large-cap tech name. ORCL stock is priced at a forward P/E ratio of 15, or four points below the S&P 500 SPX index. Assuming the shares were priced in-line with the rest of the market, they would trade today at around $52, or 20% higher. And with Ellison mashing the accelerator towards the Cloud, ORCL stock should be owned for the next 12 to 18 months."

Battle of Dividends: Apple, Inc. vs Microsoft;3/14/2017;"Even tech stocks can sometimes be soliddividend   stocksfor income investors. And two of thebest dividend   stocksin the tech sector are undoubtedlyApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) andMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) . But which of these two dividend-paying tech   juggernauts is the better bet for investors looking for   income?Comparing these two dividend stocks is particularly timely,   given thatApple stockhas soared about 21% in the past three months while Microsoft has   lagged with a 2.4% gain during the same period. After Apple's   recent rise in its stock price, is Microsoft looking more   attractive?makeArticleAd();MSFTdata byYChartsMicrosoftCompanyDividend YieldPayout Ratio3-Year Compound Average Dividend Growth             RateEPS Growth in Most Recent QuarterMicrosoft2.4%69.5%11.7%6.6%Data source: Reuters. Table by author.Microsoft is a well-rounded dividend stock. With a dividend   yield of 2.4%, the software giant easily beats Apple's 1.6%   dividend yield. Going further, the yield is meaningfully higher   than the 2% average dividend yield of stocks in the S&P   500.However, to achieve this dividend yield, Microsoft needs to   pay out a higher portion of its earnings than Apple does. In the   trailing 12 months, Microsoft has paid out 69.5% of its earnings   in dividends. Notably, however, Microsoft's dividend payments as   a percentage of its free cash flow are just 42%. Paying out only   42% of its annual free cash flow in dividends, Microsoft's   dividend is easily sustainable.Another area where Microsoft shines as a dividend stock is in   the company's underlying earnings growth. Microsoft has recently   witnessed a strong return to earnings growth, with EPS up 6.6% in   the company's most recent quarter. This earnings growth should   help Microsoft maintain its 11.7% average annual dividend   increase of the past three years.AppleCompanyDividend YieldPayout Ratio3-Year Compound Average Dividend Growth             RateEPS Growth in Most Recent QuarterApple1.6%27%9%2.3%Data source: Reuters. Table by author.Apple's weaknesses as a dividend stock compared with Microsoft   are immediately apparent. Its 1.6% dividend yield is well below   Microsoft's and even below the average 2% dividend yield of   stocks in the S&P 500. Further, Apple's earnings growth   recently is paltry. In the company's most recent quarter, EPS   rose just 2.3% year over year.But Apple stands out when it comes to its payout ratio. With a   payout ratio of just 27%, Apple has substantial room for further   dividend increases in the future. And Apple's dividend payments   as a percentage of its free cash flow are even lower, at just   23%.Image source: Getty Images.So while Apple's three-year average annualized dividend growth   of 9% is lower than Microsoft's 11.7% average annualized growth   during the same period, Apple's dividend looks as if it will   probably grow faster in the coming years.Overall, it seems that Apple's rising stock price recently has   suppressed the company's dividend yield to a low enough level to   make Microsoft look like the better dividend stock today -- a   different conclusion from in myNovember 2015 comparison, when Apple's dividend yield was higher and its payout ratio was   even lower. However, while Microsoft may be the better dividend   stock today, Apple still looks like an attractive bet for income   investors thanks to the growth potential evident from the   company's very low payout ratio.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

6 Tech Stocks to Buy for the VR Boom;3/14/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBuzzwords are one of those ""things"" that excite technology enthusiasts.

VR, or virtual reality, is an artificial environment where the user's actions partly determine what happens in that environment.3 Pharmacy Stocks at Risk Due to Skyrocketing Drug CostsThe reality is clearly more muted for this sector. The promises for this market are high, but the rate of adoption for the technology will not happen as fast as everyone thinks. With that warning, let me explain how to buy in the future of VR and AR profits when it finally comes.VR Tech Stocks to Buy: Ambarella (AMBA)Source: ShutterstockAmbarella Inc(NASDAQ:AMBA), best known for supplying forGoPro Inc(NASDAQ:GPRO), is eager to grow in markets outside of action cameras.Not only does it supply for the automotive industry, but it is embracing VR. At CES, AMBA introduced the industry's first 8K camera SoC (system on a chip). Used in high-end drones, the video camera supports 360-degree capture and virtual reality cameras. Ambarella forecasts VR cameras will start ramping up this year.Though it forecast flat revenue growth for 2017, VR is clearly a promising market that will offset the weak wearable sports camera sales made by GoPro. AMBA admits the VR market is very new. Sales will pick up, but it is still a small part of total revenue. Ambarella is optimistic but cautious about the market. Consumer demand and supplier adoption for VR technology will determine how sales do this year.VR Tech Stocks to Buy: Himax Technologies (HIMX)Source: ShutterstockHimax Technologies, Inc.

Since then, markets pin supply contracts for AR/VR will outpace this large panel display driver supplier.Himax's contracts to VR makers are real, but the company cannot reveal who they are due to confidentiality agreements. Its 24.2% gross margin in 2016 will grow once smartphones and electronic devices build in both AR and VR solutions.Himax's quarterly revenue will change from uneven to upward, once companies likeMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT), with its HoloLens, andFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB)push VR solutions to market:""We also expect our gross margin to be under pressure in the short-term due to continuous pricing pressure and less favorable product mix of driver IC products, lower revenues from high-margin AR/VR related businesses and lower NRE income.Utilities to Power Retirement Investors: 1 Stock, 1 ETF and 1 Mutual FundYou could do a lot worse.VR Tech Stocks to Buy: Microsoft (MSFT)Source: ShutterstockMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) is a key player in the VR market. Its HoloLens is still for developers to test for the viability of VR and develop applications for the environment.For now, the HoloLens is too expensive. In 2016, Microsoft made the headsetavailableto developers and business customers for $3,000 per unit. Microsoft's first challenge is getting software that runs best in a headset environment and not on a computer screen, smartphone or TV set.HoloLens is clearly more interesting than Google Glass and has stronger interest. Whereas Glass retreated from the consumer market and narrowed its market to industry, Microsoft is aiming for both the business and consumer market.Nasdaqalready uses HoloLens solutions.

QQQ Is Once Again A Top Growth ETF;3/14/2017;"The world of exchange-traded funds is filled with heavy weight indexes geared towards a variety of stock selection criteria.  The venerableSPDR S&P 500 ETF(SPY) is the largest and most heavily traded of the top ten funds by asset size.  SPY is known for its meaningful diversification, tremendous liquidity, and low costs.  It’s the benchmark by which nearly every stock-focused strategy is ultimately compared against.Having a benchmark is important because it allows investors the opportunity to compare similar investment styles to determine if a fund is meeting their expectations.  It can easily identify consistent trends that are worthy of greater interest or evasion.One such outlier among the largest U.S. stock ETFs is the pattern of outperformance demonstrated by thePowerShares QQQ(QQQ) over the last decade.  Per Yahoo Finance data, this ETF has outperformed SPY in 8 of the last 10 years.  The only two negative divergences being 2008 and 2016.makeArticleAd();What Is QQQ?One of the primary reasons for this consistent strength is the unique nature of the QQQ portfolio.  This ETF is constructed using a market-capitalization weighted asset allocation.  This method gives the largest share of assets to the biggest stocks within the index.Its security selection criteria includes the 100 largest non-financial domestic and international stocks trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market.  The index is rebalanced quarterly and constituents are re-evaluated annually to ensure they make the cut.Nasdaq is widely regarded as a landing spot for technology stocks, which is why QQQ has nearly 58% of its exposure in this single sector.  Consumer discretionary and health care stocks round out the top three groups, with 21.52% and 11.46%, respectively.It’s worth noting that Apple Inc (AAPL), Microsoft Corp (MSFT), and Amazon Inc (AMZN) represent over one quarter of the total exposure within QQQ.  That means these three mega-cap stocks are going to have an outsized impact on the fund’s total return and have been top performers over their tenure.At present QQQ has $46.5 billion in assets under management, making it the seventh largest ETF listed on U.S. exchanges.  It also charges a relatively modest expense ratio of 0.20% annually for investors to access this strategy.Historical Performance And RisksQQQ has recorded an impressive 10-year annualized gain of +12.60% versus +7.51% in SPY through 2/28/17, per fund company data.  Despite its relative weakness in 2016, this fund is off to an impressive start in the first quarter of 2017 as well.  The technology-heavy index fund carries a 5% lead over the broader benchmark and continues to demonstrate momentum divergence signals at each new all-time high.This strength has become second-nature to the those who prefer the more aggressive, growth-oriented style that QQQ conjures.  However, there are always risks to consider after a prolonged period of robust returns as well.The dominance of the QQQ portfolio has been its concentration in high-flying technology and consumer discretionary stocks, while eschewing value sectors like finance.  There may ultimately come a time when those stocks falter (like the 2000 tech crash) and QQQ falls by the wayside relative to the broader market and more defensive ETF alternatives.Furthermore, future outperformance in QQQ will need to be driven by either earnings growth of the underlying holdings or continued expansion of valuation statistics.  The latter leaves open the possibility of sharper corrections as fundamentals become stretched.The Bottom LineLike many passive ETFs that shine bright in the spotlight, QQQ’s strengths during the current bull market may ultimately be a weakness during the next cycle.  That is why it is critically important to evaluate the underlying holdings and their weighting within any ETF you are considering for your portfolio.  Security selection and position sizing are the two most important factors in long-term returns."

Intel Buys Mobileye to Boost Presence in Autonomous Cars;3/14/2017;"Intel CorporationINTCrecently announced that it is buying Israel-based Mobileye, an autonomous vehicle technology provider, for a whopping $15.3 billion in an all cash deal.Notably, Intel is paying $63.54 for each Mobileye share. This represents a 33% premium to the Mobileye's closing price of $47.00 as of Mar 10.In response to the announcement, shares of Mobileye appreciated 28.24% on the bourses. However, the news failed to excite Intel shareholders and the stock was down 2.09% at the close.We note that shares of Intel have underperformed the ZacksSemiconductor - Generalindustry over the last one year. While the industry gained 39.5%, shares of the technology major returned a modest 11.7% during the same time period.The underperformance can be due to growing competition in the semiconductor market.Intel's dominance in the chip market has come under threat due to increasing usage of ARM-based chips by the likes of MicrosoftMSFTin recent times. Moreover, sluggish PC demand continues to hurt its top line.However, we believe that the latest deal will strengthen Intel's competitive position in the autonomous car technology market, currently dominated by the likes of NVIDIANVDAand QualcommQCOM. This will help the stock rebound in the rest of 2017.What Does this Mean for Intel?Per a Business Insider report, an estimated 10 million self-driving cars will hit the pitch by 2020. An IDC report states that the burgeoning Internet of Things (IoT) space is projected to be worth $1.7 trillion by 2020 with 30 billion connected ""things"". Notably, Intel is fast gaining traction in the self-driving systems space through the acquisition of startups in the segment. With the buyout, Intel will now have access to Mobileye's  technologies related to cameras, in-car networking, sensor-chips, roadway mapping, cloud software, machine learning and data management.We also note that Mobileye isthecompany that Tesla Motors has worked with before to fulfill its autonomous vehicle dream. However, Tesla parted ways after the death of a driver trying to operate one of its Tesla Model S using Mobileye's autonomous driving technology.Hopefully, Mobileye has learnt its lessons after the crash as Intel is banking upon it to turn its fortunes around.However, competition is intensifying in the space. Some notable collaborations include Ford and Baidu's partnership to invest $150 million in Veldyne Lidar, a maker of light sensor technology. Alphabet has also partnered with Fiat Chrysler per which Google will incorporate its self-driving technology into 100 Chrysler Pacifica minivans to be used as test vehicles.Separately, Google and Ford Motor have partnered to lead a coalition of companies that will push for federal approval of autonomous cars in the near future. Uber, Lyft and Volvo are other members of this coalition.Intel Corporation Revenue (TTM)Intel Corporation Revenue (TTM)|Intel Corporation QuoteZacks RankAt present, Intel has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

5 Technology Companies That Could IPO in 2017;3/14/2017;"After a tepid 2016, the Initial Public Offering (IPO) market has been rejuvenated in 2017, primarily on the back of the recent $24 billion Snap Inc. IPO. Snap's public market debut was the biggest technology IPO since Alibaba's in 2014 and the second-largest U.S. technology based IPO ever, behind onlyFacebookFB, its closest competitor and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank   stocks here.makeArticleAd();Snap's blockbuster IPO clearly demonstrated investors' pent-up demand for technology companies. The loss-making company sold 200 million non-voting shares for $17 per share, above the expected range of $14-$16. Shares were up a massive 44% from its IPO price at the very first day of trading.Snap's hit IPO has opened up flood gates for the next round of public money seekers. This includes the likes of Mule Soft, Alteryx, Carbon Black, AppNexus, Forescout, and Cloudera, all of which are primarily tech unicorns (emerging technology companies that have a valuation of more than $1 billion).However, two high profile technology companies - Uber and Airbnb - are not expected to debut this year as both of them have raised funds in recent times.  Reportedly, Uber raised $3.5 billion from the investment arm of Saudi Arabia in Jun 2016. Airbnb recently closed $1 billion in funding, which puts the company's valuation at $31 billion.Technology IPO Market is HotAlthough Snap's recent price slide is a deterrent to IPO investors, we note that most of the issues are company specific. In fact, we believe that the current macro-economic environment is most conducive for IPO investing based on President Donald Trump's plan of spending $1 trillion on U.S. infrastructure overhauling along with regulatory and tax reforms.We note that lowering of tax rate from 35% to 15% - as proposed by President Trump during his campaign days - will be beneficial to small and mid-cap companies, particularly in the technology sector. This will surely attract IPO investors to this market going ahead.The IPO pipeline remains strong as evident from recent Renaissance Capital data, which showed that 25 IPOs have already been filed this year, up 13.6% compared with the same period last year. Moreover, technology trails only healthcare in filing most IPOs in the last 12 months.Further, ongoing consolidation in the technology market provides a significant opportunity for investors to buy new stocks that have significant growth prospects over the long term.Tech IPOs for the Rest of 2017If a favorable environment prevails, there are a number of privately funded technology companies that can taste the appetite of IPO investors in the rest of 2017. Among them, we would love to see the following five company's debut this year.Headquartered in San Francisco,Cloudflareoffers content distribution network (CDN) and distributed denial of service (DDoS) mitigation services. Per VentureBeat, the company has more than 4 million customers including the likes of CiscoCSCO, Nasdaq among others. In Sep 2015, the company raised $110 million from strategic investors like Google Capital, MicrosoftMSFT, BaiduBIDUand QualcommQCOM.Another San Francisco-based companyDropboxhas been a IPO candidate for a long-time. Dropbox is a file backup service that offers cloud-based file management, storage systems and client software. It enables users to access and synchronize files, and use applications through multiple devices. The company boasts of more than 500 million users. Per Tech Crunch, the company had raised $350 million at a valuation of $10 billion way back in 2014.Palo Alto-basedPalantir Technologiesanalyzes Big Data and is best known for two different software projects - ""Palantir Gotham"" and ""Palantir Metropolis"". It also offers a wide variety of solutions related to fraud identification, homeland and cyber security, disaster preparedness, and investing. Numerous government agencies are its customers. Late 2015, the company completed a funding round that raised $880 million and put its valuation at $20 billion.

The startup is a competitor of Microsoft Office 365 as well as Atlassian's HipChat. Per Recode, the company has two million active daily users and 800,000 subscribers.Music streaming service providerSpotifyhad been valued at over $8.5 billion in 2016, when it raised $526 million.

CenturyLink Has Its Head in the Clouds;3/14/2017;"If there's one thing that's certain in the world of   technology, it's change. And so it goes for telecommunications   giantCenturyLink(NYSE: CTL) , which continues to foster its strategic revenue   streams to offset declines in its legacy businesses.Of course, CenturyLink also has its hands full ensuring itsimpending acquisitionofLevel 3 Communications(NYSE: LVLT) closes as planned later this year. But in the   meantime, one intriguing strategic growth opportunity for   CenturyLink lies with its budding status as an IT services and   enterprise cloud solutions provider.To that end, CenturyLink recently launched its new Cloud   Application Manager, a ""cloud-agnostic management platform""   designed to simplify enterprise customers' deployment of   workloads, managed services, and third-party cloud resources   across hybrid hosting environments.makeArticleAd();CenturyLink's Cloud Application manager helps automate and     manage multiple clouds from a single interface. Image source:     CenturyLinkOne cloud platform to rule them all...According to David Shacochis, CenturyLink VP of Hybrid IT   product management:Many of our customers and partners struggle with the     business challenge of determining the best execution venue for     their business applications. We designed Cloud Application     Manager to give our customers a wide variety of infrastructure     options across diverse public and private cloud environments.     Cloud Application Manager helps companies avoid vendor lock-in,     automate application deployments, scale workloads across     disparate hosting environments, and optimize their costs over     time.Better yet, CenturyLink is offering customers the   flexibility to use Cloud Application Manager through either a   self-service model with their own IT staff, or as one actively   managed by CenturyLink's team. Cloud Application Manager also   comes in either a cloud-based software-as-a-service (SaaS)   version, or in a ""data center version"" with a virtual appliance   that runs on-premises in the customer's data center.If all of this sounds familiar, it's likely because Cloud   Application Manager leveraged CenturyLink's $20 millionacquisition of multi-cloud platform   specialistElasticBox this past June. At the time, CenturyLink CTO   Aamir Hussain noted their acquiree's compelling platform   supported over a dozen different cloud providers, includingAmazonWeb Services,IBM's SoftLayer,MicrosoftAzure, andVMware, as well as Google Compute Engine, OpenStack, and of course   CenturyLink Cloud.As Hussain further elaborated, ElasticBox's platform freed   ""businesses to focus on issues that are central to their   organization rather than spending time and resources managing   multiple clouds.""Better days ahead?So what does this mean for CenturyLink's business? For   perspective, during CenturyLink's quarterly conference call last   month, management explained that lower-than-expected managed   hosting and IT services revenue was one culprit for the company   arriving near the low end of its fourth-quarter 2016   guidance.To be fair, the bulk of the blame still sat with slower growth   in both CenturyLink's consumer broadband and consumer video   revenue. But those obviously troublesome segments come with their   own challenges. And any relative success CenturyLink can garner   through current and forthcoming products like Cloud Application   Manager could serve to not only drive incremental revenue   themselves, but also afford the company a perfect segue into   CenturyLink's other complementary IT consulting and managed   services solutions.Prior to Cloud Application Manager's formal launch, for   example, CenturyLink had already launched other new and expanded   solutions in recent months spanning managed security services,   Managed SAP and HANA, enterprise cloud and managed big data, and   Big Data-as-a-Service products. CenturyLink CEO Glen Post   insisted they ""have all been very well received by industry   analysts and are beginning to show good traction with our   customers.""In the end, then, I think investors would do well to keep a   close eye on any similar signs of early traction for   CenturyLink's Cloud Application Manager when the company next   reports quarterly results in early May. If it proves successful,   it could mean better days ahead for patient CenturyLink   shareholders.10 stocks we like better than CenturyLinkWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Intel Corp. and Qualcomm, Inc.: On a Collision Course;3/14/2017;"For years, there has been very little intersection betweenIntel's(NASDAQ: INTC) core businesses andQualcomm's(NASDAQ: QCOM) . Intel's revenue today comes primarily from   sales of personal-computer processors, processors for enterprise   and cloud servers, and networking applications.Qualcomm, on the other hand, makes most of its profit from   licensing wireless technologies and patents, and generates most   of its revenue by selling chips that go into smartphones and, to   a lesser extent, other mobile devices like tablets.Image source: Qualcomm.makeArticleAd();For years, it has been widely known that Qualcomm was working   on processors designed to attack Intel's data-center dominance;   first commercial shipments are expected to begin in the second   half of 2017. And for years, Intel has been going on about trying   to attack Qualcomm's wireless-chip business -- achieving its   first real success last year when it captured cellular-modem   share from Qualcomm inApple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) iPhone 7-series smartphones.In other words, these two chip giants are on a collision   course. Let's look at what each side could lose, what each side   stands to gain, and what this coming battle might mean for   investors in either company.Intel deals its major -- but potentially only -- blowIn the past, Intel had told investors that it expected to   compete broadly across the mobile-processor market. Indeed, the   company said it was developing a whole stack of chips, designed   to span everything from low-end smartphones to what the company   referred to as ""hero devices.""In addition to those chips, Intel had been pursuing   stand-alone cellular-modem efforts for quite some time, though   with little success until recently.Investors might be aware that Intel canceled its pipeline of   mobile-processor products and substantially reduced its   investment levels there. (Intel said at its most recent investor   meeting that from 2015 to 2017, its spending in mobile will go   down about 55%.)So, Intel is, by and large, neutralized as a threat to   Qualcomm's mobile-processor business.However, the company won a large portion of the cellular-modem   spots inside Apple's iPhone 7 series of smartphones, which led to   a reasonable bump in revenue for Intel and a corresponding   decrement to Qualcomm's revenues.Qualcomm sharpening its knivesThough Intel's mobile efforts ultimately translated into   Qualcomm losing some business at Apple, Qualcomm's ambitions are   much more significant.Qualcomm announced that it will be working with software giantMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) to bring personal computers running Windows 10 on   Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 processors to market during the second   half of 2017 -- directly attacking Intel's largest business.To make matters worse for Intel (and perhaps sweeten the deal   for Qualcomm), Qualcomm seems committed to developing data-center   processors for now. Significant share gains on Qualcomm's part   (and corresponding share losses on Intel's part) -- should they   occur -- aren't likely to happen overnight.However, Qualcomm's upcoming Centriq 2400 chips havealready gotten Microsoft's blessingfor its internal use, which lends credibility to the notion that   major data-center customers may be willing -- and, frankly, eager   -- to work with alternative suppliers rather than Intel.The upside and downside for each companyFor Intel, the only upside I see in this contest is its   potential to gain some additional cellular-modem share from   Qualcomm at Apple. The opportunity likely isn't that big from the   standpoint of annual revenue, and that revenue would likely come   at a much lower margin than Intel's corporate average. Right now,   Intel's ability to hurt Qualcomm in its core wireless-chip   business seems limited.The upside for Qualcomm, on the other hand, seems greater. It   can take share from Intel in the latter company's core business   of personal-computer chips, as well as its data-center business,   starting from essentially zero share.Intel certainly has significant resources with which to defend   itself, so it's probably not prudent for investors in either   company to model in substantial market-share shifts to Qualcomm   anytime soon. But, in terms of which company has more to gain and   which has more to lose: The answers come up Qualcomm and Intel,   respectively.10 stocks we like better than QualcommWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

How Intel Corporation's Execution Issues Have Helped Qualcomm, Inc.;3/13/2017;"It's no secret that wireless chip giantQualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM) is making all sorts of noise about its efforts to   become a major player in the market for data center processors.   Not only has the company made public its plans to push into this   market, but the chipmaker recently announced that it is working   closely with software giantMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) to ""accelerate next generation cloud services on   its 10 nanometer Qualcomm Centriq 2400 platform"" and that ""this   collaboration will span multiple future generations of hardware,   software and system.""You'll notice that Qualcomm loves to highlight the fact that   its Centriq 2400 is manufactured on a 10-nanometer technology.   This is intentional, as the market leader that Qualcomm is trying   to compete with --Intel(NASDAQ: INTC) -- won't be shipping server processors based on   its own 10-nanometer technology anytime soon.Image source: Intel.makeArticleAd();Now, Intel will argue that its 14-nanometer technology is   roughly equivalent in terms of apples-to-apples chip area to the   10-nanometer chip manufacturing technology that Qualcomm is using   for its chips (though Intel admits that the foundry 10-nanometer   technologies are ahead of its own 14-nanometer technologies in   this respect).That's a reasonable argument, but here's the uncomfortable   implication that comes from that: Qualcomm's upcoming Centriq   2400 processors will still be built on a denser manufacturing   technology than Intel's upcoming Skylake-based server processors   will.It's clear that Intel's execution problems with respect to   both product development as well as manufacturing technology have   helped Qualcomm. Let me explain why.Intel's fighting with the wrong chipsHad Intel's manufacturing and product development roadmap not   gotten off track, it would have launched the Skylake server parts   in the fall of 2016 and would possibly be preparing its first   10-nanometer server processors for launch in the second half of   2017.In that case -- if Intel's claims that its 10-nanometer   technology is significantly denser than competing 10-nanometer   technologies are accurate -- Intel would have been time-to-market   with Qualcomm's Centriq 2400 server processor with its own   10-nanometer server processor family.This would have meant that Intel would have a   higher-performing, more power efficient family of products with   which to fend off the potential threat that Qualcomm poses to its   lucrative data center business.No 10-nanometer for a while for IntelIt is unlikely that Intel will bring to market server   processors based on its 10-nanometer technology in 2018, at least   based on a leaked road map from Dell that's beencirculating around the Web.So, if we assume that the first 10-nanometer Intel server   processors arrive in the first half of 2019, then it's very   likely that Qualcomm will have moved past the 10-nanometer   Centriq 2400 and will compete with such a part using foundry   7-nanometer technology.Since the foundry 7-nanometer technologies are likely to be   like Intel's 10-nanometer technology in terms of transistor   density, it's unlikely that Intel will be able to claim a   substantial manufacturing technology density lead when it comes   to data center chips.Conversely, Qualcomm will be able to market having the   ""world's first"" 7-nanometer server chips.The first step is admitting you've got a     problemIt's bad enough that Intel's execution problems have allowed a   relative newcomer to the data center chip market to start   bringing to market chips using denser technologies than Intel's   use. What makes it worse, though, is that Intel management simply   refuses to publicly acknowledge that theremightbe a problem with its execution that needs to be addressed.Indeed, the companystilltells investors that it has athree year leadin terms of the density of the manufacturing technologies that it   brings to market!As long as Intel remains convinced that it has a ""three year   lead"" in terms of chip area over its competitors, despite the   serious execution problems, schedule slips, and trail of   cancelled products left by virtually all of its business units,   then it's unlikely that the company is going to take the actions   necessary to correct whatever organizational flaws that led to   this situation in the first place.The first step is admitting you have a problem, and when it   comes to manufacturing technology, Intel simply isn't ready to do   that yet.10 stocks we like better than IntelWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

One Put, One Call Option To Know About for Microsoft;3/13/2017;"Consistently, one of the more popular stocks people enter into theirstock options watchlistat Stock Options Channel is Microsoft Corporation (Symbol: MSFT). So this week we highlight one interesting put contract, and one interesting call contract, from the April expiration for MSFT. The put contract our YieldBoost algorithm identified as particularly interesting, is at the $62 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of 70 cents. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 1.1% return against the $62 commitment, or a 9% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this theYieldBoost).Selling a put does not give an investor access to MSFT's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. So unless Microsoft Corporation sees its shares decline 4.3% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $61.30 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the 70 cents from $62), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 9% annualized rate of return.makeArticleAd();Interestingly, that annualized 9% figure actually exceeds the 2.4% annualized dividend paid by Microsoft Corporation by 6.6%, based on the current share price of $64.76. And yet, if an investor was to buy the stock at the going market price in order to collect the dividend, there is greater downside because the stock would have to lose 4.28% to reach the $62 strike price.Always important when discussing dividends is the fact that, in general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of Microsoft Corporation, looking at the dividend history chart for MSFT below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 2.4% annualized dividend yield.Turning to the other side of the option chain, we highlight one call contract of particular interest for the April expiration, for shareholders of Microsoft Corporation (Symbol: MSFT) looking to boost their income beyond the stock's 2.4% annualized dividend yield. Selling the covered call at the $65.50 strike and collecting the premium based on the $1.35 bid, annualizes to an additional 16.5% rate of return against the current stock price (this is what we at Stock Options Channel refer to as theYieldBoost), for a total of 18.9% annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away. Any upside above $65.50 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away, but MSFT shares would have to climb 1.1% from current levels for that to occur, meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called, the shareholder has earned a 3.2% return from this trading level, in addition to any dividends collected before the stock was called.The chart below shows the trailing twelve month trading history for Microsoft Corporation, highlighting in green where the $62 strike is located relative to that history, and highlighting the $65.50 strike in red:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the April put or call options highlighted in this article deliver a rate of return that represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Microsoft Corporation (considering the last 251 trading dayMSFT historical stock pricesusing closing values, as well as today's price of $64.76) to be 19%.In mid-afternoon trading on Monday, the put volume among S&P 500 components was 685,332 contracts, with call volume at 685,332, for a put:call ratio of 0.73 so far for the day, which is above normal compared to the long-term median put:call ratio of .65. In other words, if we look at the number of call buyers and then use the long-term median to project the number of put buyers we'd expect to see, we're actually seeing more put buyers than expected out there inoptions tradingso far today.Find out which 15 call and put options traders are talking about today.Top YieldBoost MSFT Calls »"

Can NVIDIA Regain Its Mojo?;3/13/2017;"It seems somewhat disingenuous referring to a stock that has rallied roughly 530% over the last five years as having ""lost its mojo.""However, the fact remains that shares of graphics chip leaderNVIDIA(NASDAQ: NVDA) have indeed fallen roughly 18% from their 52-week high in early February.makeArticleAd();NVDAdata byYCharts.So, how should investors think about this newfound bearishness in NVIDIA shares? Does the sell-off in its stock represent a paradigm shift in investor sentiment toward the company, or does it create an attractive potential entry point? Let's explore this topic in greater detail.NVIDIA stock: What goes up must come down?The only major news to break since NVIDIA's stock peaked -- which occurred on February 7th -- was the company's release of its full-year and fourth-quarter results for its fiscal year 2017, which took place on February 9th. As a quick point of clarification, NVIDIA runs its fiscal year one full year ahead of the calendar year, for some odd reason.At any rate, NVIDIA actually released earnings that exceeded analyst estimates in terms of sales and profits.If anything, it seems safe to say that some investors have been simply taking profits on their NVIDIA investments, a strategy that seems sensible for short-term investors concerned about NVDIIA's admittedly rich valuation. Moreover, while it enjoys many well-defined positives, there is one potential storm forming on the horizon that could sap some of the wind from NVIDIA's sails.Long-time graphics laggardAdvanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD) plans to launch its Vega chip series later this year, a move that some analysts believe could allow AMD to steal significant market GPU market share from NVIDIA. Though we don't know any of the specifics regarding AMD's Vega chips yet, the hope is that they will serve as a cheaper alternative to NVIDIA's GTX chip series, while not sacrificing much in the way of performance. If that proves to be the case, NVIDIA could be forced to lower the prices of corresponding chipsets. Of course, worrying about this is putting the cart before the horse to a certain extent, but it bears noting as something that could inhibit NVIDIA's growth. And given NVIDIA'ssky-high valuation, that could be enough to compel investors sitting on large paper gains to sell.Image source: NVIDIA.NVIDIA long-term business outlook remains favorableIn as much as NVIDIA has indeed ""lost its mojo,"" it's important to remember that NVIDIA's multiyear investment thesis appearsas strong as ever. As we saw in its earnings release, the main drivers underpinning NVIDIA's growth today are high-end gaming, artificial intelligence (AI) software, and self-driving cars.eSports still don't receive a lot of coverage from the mainstream media, but the craze's momentum is undeniable. eSport's global audience was estimated to reach 256 million viewers in 2016, according to one industry researcher. Large events regularly enjoy sponsorship from blue-chip brands likeCoca-Cola,Nissan, and more, which has led to a dramatic increase in purse sizes for some of the genre's most popular events. This, in turn, has helped increase the awareness of the pastime to many casual fans, particularly in Asia, where the sport is most popular. The same researcher believes total revenue related to eSports will reach $1.1 billion by 2019, up from $463 million in 2016. The rush of money and interest into the sport should help continue to create demand for NVIDIA's best-of-breed graphics processing chips, which rose 44% last year.Better still, major trends like AI software and driverless cars remain in their early stages. Last year, NVIDIA saw an unprecedented surge in demand for its GPUs to power an impressive host of applications. NVIDIA's GPUs are the chip of choice to power the various AI projects at tech giants such asMicrosoft,Alphabet,Facebook, the National Cancer Institute, the U.S. Department of Energy, and many others. Turning to self-driving cars, NVIDIA has also partnered with an impressive array of major automakers, though this technology figures to more meaningfully contribute to its growth early next decade.Not to belabor the point, but hopefully it's clear now that NVIDIA has far from lost its mojo. True, the company's stock prices has fallen from its recent all-time highs, but it easily remains in positive territory over the last 12 months, and for good reason. NVIDIA is one of the best-positioned companies to profit from several of the largest continuing trends in technology.10 stocks we like better than NvidiaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Heres How I Invest My Own Retirement Cash;3/13/2017;"By Brett OwensIt's a question I get a lot, both from members of myContrarian Income Reportservice and folks who drop by ourContrarianOutlookwebsite:How do you invest your own nest egg?I'll answer it in just a moment.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');I was reminded of this question again last week, when I was   looking at the returns of theVanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF (VIG)--and thinking about how dead simple it would be to beat the   fund's return over the long haul.All it would take is the slightest bit of research.Big on Hype, Short on PerformanceVIG is one of the best cases I've seen of an investment taking   an inherent advantage and getting nothing out of it.The fund tracks the NASDAQ US Dividend Achievers Select Index,   which includes 184 companies that have raised their payouts   annually for at least 10 years. For that reason, it gets a lot of   airtime from the pundits, who regularly peg it as a proxy for   dividend growers in general.And if you've read my columns, you know I'm a big fan ofdividend-growth stocks.The reason: they consistently rack up some of the market's   biggest gains.What I consider the leading study on the subject, by research   firm Ned Davis & Associates, proves it. After sifting through   43 years' worth of data, from January 1972 through December 2014,   Davis's researchers found that dividend growers topped all other   types of stocks.It wasn't even close: with a 10.1% average annual return, they   blew away steady payers (7.1%) and non-payers (2.6%).So VIG should easily beat the S&P 500, then, right?Wrong.Stretch it over any timeframe: one year, three years, five   years, 10 years and since VIG's inception in 2006, and at best   your return would havejust barelysqueaked past the market's.Dividend-Growth Edge Goes AWOLThat's disappointing, given VIG's built-in edge.Now let's go one step further and pick the five fastest   dividend growers among VIG's top 10 current holdings (without   even getting into P/E ratios, earnings history, revenue growth   and the like) over the past decade.Those five stocks areCVS Health (CVS), Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA), Microsoft (MSFT), PepsiCo (PEP)andMedtronic (MDT).A quick backtest shows that all but one (Medtronic) have   outperformed VIG:Active Investing Wins AgainHolding these five would have handed you a 152.3% total   return, compared to 110.9% for VIG, as their relentless dividend   growth (ranging from 150.8% for PepsiCo to a massive 733.3% for   CVS) squeezed their share prices higher.And that's just the result of a fairly ""dumb"" dividend-growth   strategy. Now let's see what happens when we add just a little   more refinement.Which brings me to...Where My Retirement Cash Is Going NowRight now, I'm putting 100% of my 401(k) contributions into   VIG's cousin, theVanguard Dividend Growth Fund (VDIGX).That's because I have to choose from a set list of funds, but at   least one of them is VDIGX, which is a proven winner.According to the prospectus, VDIGX focuses on ""high-quality   companies that have prospects for long-term total returns as a   result of their ability to grow earnings and their willingness to   increase dividends over time.""Manager Donald J. Kilbride also considers factors like   valuation and future dividend-growth potential. That's a much   more focused approach than VIG's.Kilbride's stewardship comes at a cost, however: the fund's   expense ratio is 0.33%, more than three times higher than VIG's   0.09%. But he's earning his keep, delivering a total return   that's crushed VIG and the market since VDIGX's inception in   February 2006 (net of fees, of course):The Power of a Focused Dividend-Growth     StrategyBut if you're thinking of buying VDIGX now, you're out of   luck. Vanguard closed the fund to new investors in July 2016.Even so, as with VIG, we can do an end run around that and   pick the five fastest dividend growers (again over the past 10   years) from among VDIGX's top 10 holdings, which combined make up   29.8% of the portfolio.Here, we're getting both fast dividend growthandpiggybacking on Kilbride's eye for value and dividend-growth   potential.These stocks are:Microsoft (MSFT), Costco Wholesale (COST), Chubb (CB), Medtronic (MDT)andUnion Pacific (UNP).(For this back test, I've left outCanadian National Railway (CNI),whose dividend growth would have qualified it in Canadian-dollar   terms but falls short when converted to US funds.)Again, we see the same result: four of these five beat VDIGX,   with the sole exception, again, being Medtronic:Active Investing: 2, Passive: 0What's more, these five dividend growers generated a combined   total return of 244.5%. That'sfarmore than the 152.3% we squeezed out of our five VIG   selections.It also neatly captures the power of combining dividend growth   with bargain valuations, a strong earnings history and other   signs of payout strength.The bottom line? Investing in a ""dumb"" dividend-growth ETF is   okay. A ""smart"" one is better, and picking your own dividend   growers (which, by the way, is how I invest my personal   retirement stash) is hands-down the best way to go.The Sweet Spot: 8% YieldsWithDividend GrowthDividend growth is great, but none of the stocks above yield   more than 2.8% today. What if you need big dividend incomenowso you can retire comfortably?After all,2.8% just won't cut it unless you're rich already!But you can retire on as little as $500,000 today by focusing   on stealth income plays such as closed-end funds (CEFs),   preferred shares and real estate investment trusts (REITs). In   many cases, these issues pay secure yields of 8% or better--with   dividend growth to boot!This meansyou're assuring yourself of 10%+ annual returns, with   most of that coming as cash dividends!These vehicles are safe, but they aren't as well known as your   typical (and usually expensive) blue chip. And that'sgoodfor us, because we can lock up secure income streams of 8% or   more while enjoying payout growth and price upside, too.The 6 bargain buys I want to show you today are perfect for   2017. Because no matter what happens in Washington or with the   Fed, these 8% payers are going to become increasingly popular   with retirees as they're discovered.

Investing Podcast Highlights: Caterpillar, Canada Goose, Equal-Weight Funds, and More;3/13/2017;"Chicago, IL-March 13, 2017-Zacks Investment Research is a leading provider of investment-related data, research, and commentary. Each week, several of the company's analysts and editors publish exclusive podcasts that highlight some of the financial world's top stories and provide investors with a variety of strategies based on Zacks' proven stock-picking methods.Friday Finish Line with Ryan McQueeney and Maddy   JohnsonOnEpisode #39of the Zacks Friday Finish Line Podcast, Content Writer Ryan McQueeney and Editor Maddy Johnson take on this week's biggest stories, including the current state of the IPO market in the wake of Snap's historic debut.Before that, the hosts touched on the recent volatility in the oil market, which has caused some to question whether OPEC will continue its production cuts; Facebook'sFBnew Snapchat clone, Messenger Day; and the federal investigation surrounding CaterpillarCAT.Finally, Maddy and Ryan chatted about the IPO market in the wake of Snap Inc.'sSNAPmassive debut. Investors are thirsty for more initial public offerings, and there might just be a few more this year. For example, the hosts discussed Spotify and Airbnb, which could be IPO candidates soon.In the meantime, companies like J. JillJILLand Canada Goose are choosing to go public right now. Maddy and Ryan also discussed why these brands are choosing IPOs and what they can both do to continue growing.The Dutram Report with Eric DutramOnEpisode #13of The Dutram Report, Eric Dutram is joined by Michael Willis, the lead portfolio manager of INDEX Funds. His key product, the Index Funds S&P 500 Equal WeightINDEX, takes the same S&P 500 stocks, but invests in them equally.In the actual S&P 500, AppleAAPLaccounts for about 4% of the total, while MicrosoftMSFTmakes up about 2.5% of the weighted index. This fund covers the same companies, but each one takes up about 0.2% of the total.Together, Eric and Michael discussed how this small change can actually make a big difference to overall returns. Michael argued that the equal weight fund is a much more balanced way to achieve exposure, and its own fact sheet shows that this approach has outperformed the market over long periods of time.Shopping for Stocks with Maddy JohnsonOnEpisode #3of Shopping for Stocks, Maddy Johnson takes a look at what could be one of the most interesting IPOs in years: Canada Goose.Canada Goose is a designer and manufacturer of high-end parkas, down coats, and cold-weather accessories. The company is hoping to raise as much as $240 million by listing 20 million shares in both New York and Toronto.Maddy discussed Canada Goose's products and popularity, as well as its standing in today's unfriendly retail environment.Want More Zacks Podcast Content?Check back every week for several new episodes of these shows and many more from Zacks Investment Research.

Voice: The Next Computing Empire;3/11/2017;"This article is the first in a two-part series aimed at     exploring the rapidly developing state of voice computing from     the investor's perspective. In Part I, I discuss why it's now     increasingly clear that the human voice will become society's     next major computing interface, and why it will continue     proliferating through our homes and businesses. In Part II,     I'll dive deeper into the new and emerging business models. In     Part II, I'll discuss the various players involved in the race     to commercialize the technology -- those best-positioned to     profit today, those positioning themselves to thrive tomorrow,     and those dropping the ball entirely. I'll also dive deeper     into the fascinating business models voice computing will soon     enable, and how those models will evolve as the technology     continues to improve.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();For nearly 40 years, we've seen the computer evolve into an   indispensable accessory of Western society driven by three   powerful technologies that defined their eras and played a   monumental role for investors along the way.The personal computer gave many of us our first glimpse at the   digital world, normalizing the idea that such machines have a   place in our homes and everyday lives. The internet tapped us   into that world, offering us endless floods of information,   entertainment, and commerce around which we willingly began   shaping our civilization. And then the smartphone encouraged us   to take that digital world everywhere we go, leaving nothing but   a few taps on a touchscreen between us, our computers, and   constant immersion.Now, a fourth technology -- voice computing--is removing that last barrier.Reimagining the roles computers playImagine driving down the highway, coming home from work, and     without taking your hands off the wheel or hitting any buttons,     asking your car to turn up the heat in your house, preheat the     oven for dinner, and play your favorite album, all in the same     breath. Picture negotiating with a street vendor in Beijing,     having your phone translate the entire conversation between     Mandarin and English out loud, so you can haggle in real time.     Or how about a stuffed animal that can tell your daughter     interactive stories every night before bed, reshaping the     adventure at every twist and turn based on her responses and     reactions.These aren't hypothetical scenarios -- they're happening     right now.The human voice is well on its way to becoming the next     major medium we use to interact with computers, and as we'll     explore in this two-part series,voicecomputingis the burgeoning field of technology making it possible.     Already spanning multiple consumer and enterprise ventures     (think call center routing, digital dictation, or the virtual     assistants on smartphones), the industry's ultimate aim is     enabling people to carry on hands-free, conversational-style     interactions with computers.It's an ambitious prospect capable of significantly     expanding the roles computers play in our everyday lives, but     it's also one that appears inevitable when considering the     trajectory computers have taken, without fail, since their     introduction, evolving in shape and form around contemporary     technology to solve unmet needs.Image Source: Getty ImagesAnd yet voice computing's evolution is different. Unlike any     form of computing to come before it, the technology bypasses     the physical realm, allowing users to query the internet,     manage their surroundings, and connect to third-party services     without ever having to touch a physical device -- all in the     time it takes to form a sentence.If that sounds unnecessary, then consider just how limitless     the applications could be. From the surgeon who needs to     rapidly adjust the conditions of her operating room     mid-procedure, to the disabled veteran who simply hopes to     access the appliances in his home. The sheer number of everyday     applications for such a technology has prompted Grand View     Research to project the global market for voice recognition     technology will reach $128 billion annually by 2024, an     estimate that may undershoot the overall economic opportunity     at play considering the potential verticals include healthcare,     defense, entertainment, consumer goods, and more (I'll discuss     these in more detail in Part II).There is one thing we can be certain of, however. Voice     computing is extremely likely to transform the way we interact     with technology in society, but before that can happen, a     large-scale societal shift toward adopting the interface must     occur, a shift thatcannotoccur until several key hurdles are overcome.Understanding the challenges aheadTo analyze those obstacles, let's turn to the most       promising application of voice-driven technology today:       virtual digital assistants.Data Sources: Socratic Technologies, Vantiv, Statista.         Chart by AuthorThanks to the success of the iPhone andApple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) other devices, Siri is currently the most       wildly used virtual assistant in the United States, but until       recently, it's also perfectly exemplified what's holding       voice computing back. To put it simply, speaking with Siri       can often feel more like a novelty than a time-saver, a       sentiment shared not just among Apple users, but most       smartphone owners with access to similar voice computing       technology.It's a problem we can break down into three fundamental       hurdles.The first is that users must often resort to awkward       combinations of hyper-specific phrasing and hurried       robo-speak to have their speech accurately recognized. Andrew       Ng, chief scientist atBaidu(NASDAQ: BIDU) and one the most respected names in the field,       perhaps put it best in 2015 when he noted, ""Speech       recognition, depending on the circumstances, is say 95 per       cent accurate. So maybe it gets one word in 20 wrong. That's       really annoying if it gets one in 20 wrong and you probably       don't want to use it very often. That's probably where speech       recognition is today.""The second hurdle is that even when our speech iscorrectlyrecognized, there still remains a strong chance it will bemisinterpretedwhile undergoing natural language understanding, a process in       which the assistant attempts to comprehend what we want using       the sequence of words (and eventually, the tone, pace, and       inflection) we give. And even if that speech is correctly       understood, an assistant may still simply be unable to solve       for the request due to technical constraints. Examples of       both cases can be seen in the screenshot below, along with a       sense of how frustrating the encounter can be.Image Source: Author's iPhoneEncounters like these make us feel as though we're wasting       our time trusting our phones to do what we could have done       ourselves with only a little more effort upfront. Over time,       they build up, eventually discouraging us from even tryingto       use our assistants for anything complex, instead relying on       them only for the most trivial of tasks, like setting alarms       or creating reminders.Thankfully, these first two hurdles are solvable with data,   third-party partnerships, and time, each of which the major   players in this space have been actively accruing for years.   Returning to our example, since Siri was introduced to the world   in 2011, virtual assistants have grown far more capable of   correctly interpreting requests thanks to advances in deep   learning, a thriving field of AI being utilized byAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) ,Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) , Baidu, and others to improve speech recognition,   natural language understanding, and other components of voice   computing at astounding rates. (Click herefor an outstanding story byThe New York Timeson Google's significant role in making this happen).Equally as important, decisions by Apple and its competitors   to open their platforms up to third-party services have made   today's voice-based assistants feel far more capable than in   years past. These decisions allow Siri, for example, to call you   a ride using your Uber account, or order a pizza through your   storedDomino'sinformation -- not unlike anactualsecretary would do.As the potential behind voice computing becomes increasingly   obvious in the coming months and years, we should expect more and   more third parties to hop on board, eventually expanding the   scope of what a partnership could entail (instead of ordering an   Uber, imagine ordering a plane ticket). One look at the rate of   growth for third-party commands available on Amazon's voice-based   assistant, Alexa, can tell us a lot.Data Source: Voicebot. Chart by AuthorWith time, these technical achievements and partnerships will   continue compounding, eventually making for a highly practical   voice computing experience. Even marginal improvements in the   technology will convince users to begin using voice as an   interface more frequently. In the same talk regarding the current   state of the voice industry, Ng went on to say, ""I think that as   speech recognition accuracy goes from say 95 per cent to 98, 99   to 99.9, all of us in the room will go from barely using it   today, to using it all the time."" He added, ""Most people   underestimate the difference between 95 and 99 per cent ... 99   per cent is a game changer.""Although we're not yet able to predict when the technology   will reach that point, if the recent pace of progress is any   indication -- since Ng's speech, Baidu has built a program   capable of dictating English three times faster, and with 20%   less errors, than human beings -- it won't be much longer.In the meantime, an arguably far more important hurdle stands   in the way. It's a problem shared by every other major computing   medium in use today, only voice is actually solving for it.An instantaneous computing experienceNo matter the medium, we've always interacted with computers   by issuing commands. In the 1950s, we meticulously punched those   commands into cards before feeding them into hulking machines.   Now, technology allows us to simply type, click, and,   increasingly, speak them and expect a result.Yet despite these advancements, today's mediums still subject   users to a unique set of delays, a sort of friction that   inherently slows down the process betweenthinkinga command and actually being able tocommunicatethat command to your devices. A decade ago, that friction most   likely entailed tracking down a PC with internet, using the mouse   to open a browser, using the keyboard to run a search, and then   sorting for the result. But today, for most Americans, it simply   means reaching into our pockets for our phone, scrolling with our   thumb, and tapping away.It's a process so effortless, the average American now checks   their phone an estimated 46 times per day. It's even become   fashionable to argue there's no longerenoughfriction separating society from our devices; that we'retooplugged in to the digital world.So when you consider that voice computing's primary advantage   iseliminatingfriction, it becomes tempting to dismiss the technology as a   solution to a trivial problem. What that argument critically   fails to consider, however, is that friction is about more than   simple convenience, and that any amount of friction, no matter   how small, fundamentally limits the dynamic between a user and   their computing medium in two ways.Let's take the smartphone for example.Image Source: PixabayThe seemingly trivial motions we make when reaching for our   phone still require us to be in immediate proximity of the   device. We have to walk over to kitchen counter if we left our   phone there; we have to remember it's on the counter even before   we can do that. Then, once we've reached our phone, we're   required to physically handle it, a process that generally   requires we have one hand free and able.That may not sound like much, but these limitations force our   computing experience to revolve around the location of our   device, as opposed to it revolving around us.They can create roadblocks for those with disabilities affecting   their vision or hands (or really, even those who just have sticky   hands, wet hands, or their hands full), those far away from their   device, and most importantly, those with an immediate computing   need.There's a reason speech is our most instinctual form of   communication.If we have a question, and if we know those around us can   answer that question, we don't pull out our phone and run a   search, we open our mouths and ask. We do that because it's   instantaneous. Now contrast that with having to locate your   phone, having to type in your password, having to navigate to an   app, having to tap, type, or speak your command. These behaviors   are not instinctual,but we put up with them because the people around us usually   don't have the answers, and because smartphones are our best   alternative.But they don't have to be.The rise of voiceIt's not obvious quite yet, but today's physically bound   mediums have left a large hole to fill and voice computing is   starting to fill it.Over the past two years, the technology has begun manifesting   itself in the form of always-on, always-listening devices able to   virtually bypass the friction inherent in today's major computing   mediums. Currently, these devices are best exemplified by   Amazon's line of Echo smart speakers, which employ far-field   voice recognition technology allowing users to command Alexa from   across multiple rooms and through various background noises at   any time simply by calling for it out loud.Image Source: Amazon.com.Put another way, for as little as $50, Amazon's Echo is giving   consumers their first glimpse at a frictionless computing   experience. Following its initial setup, there's no pressing   buttons, no looking around for the device, and no navigating   through screens to issue a command. When it works correctly (like   Siri, Alexa is still very much in its infancy and subject to   misinterpreting commands) it really does allow users to convert   their thoughts to a command in the time it takes to form a   sentence, capturing the essential promise of voice as a   medium.And if the early estimated adoption rate for the device is any   indication -- Amazon hasn't officially released sales   figures, but as of January 2016, Consumer Intelligence Research   Partners (CIRP) estimates a staggering 8.2 million Echos have   already been sold in the U.S. (a number that pales in comparison   to Morgan Stanley's estimates of over 11 million), suggesting the   device has achieved well over 5% household penetration -- early   demand for a seamless computing experience is strong, and will   likely grow stronger as capable competitors race to introduce   their own offerings (see Google's Home,Nvidia's(NASDAQ: NVDA) Spot, or Baidu's Little Fish), and as voice   recognition, natural language understanding, and third-party   support continue improving at rapid pace.Data Sources: VoiceLabs, CIRP, KPCB, InfoScout. *2017     figures are VoiceLab projections. Chart by AuthorTo be clear, these devices will never replace today's existing   computing mediums, but will rather augment them. While   screens will remain the preferred medium for our more detailed   and visual computing needs, voice will begin its ascent by taking   on an increasing share of our more ""conversational"" demands,   common requests we want addressed with the immediacy we expect   from dialogue (""Cancel my doctor's appointment."" ""Pause that   music!"" ""What's a good non-fiction book to read on the beach? ...   Great, order that one."")As the technology grows capable of handling increasingly   nuanced and complex requests, and as voice-enabled devices   proliferate and evolve, we can expect more users to grow   comfortable engaging with the technology around the home, in the   workplace, and gradually more pervasive aspects of society.Andthat'swhere the real opportunities begin.The opportunity at handSome of the biggest tech empires in modern history have been   built around the personal computer, internet, and smartphone,   each of which has provided the infrastructure for technology to   penetrate deeper and more reflexively into everyday life,   allowing creative companies to reach consumers in entirely new   ways.In just 10 years, the iPhone helped Apple grow to become the   largest corporation in the world, but it also popularized   smartphone technology in the U.S., helping to create the   infrastructure that in turn enabledFacebook(NASDAQ: FB) ,Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) , Alphabet, Uber,Snap, Amazon,Shopify(NYSE: SHOP) , and countless others to create businesses that   reach deeper into our lives than any before.Image Source: Author's iPhoneAnd yet voice technology is going deeper.It's becoming an invisible, always-listening medium that   surrounds us, weaving itself more seamlessly into the fabric of   our lives than any before it. It's called on using our most   instinctual, reflexive form of communication, and it's accessible   in the time it takes to form words. It's a technology that   provides tomorrow's innovators a far more intimate and pervasive   way to help us satisfy our digital wants.It's a startling but increasingly inevitable reality for both   investors and society.In Part II: The Playing Field, I'll discuss various players   involved in the race to commercialize voice computing.

Here's Why the Best Is Yet to Come for Microsoft Corporation;3/11/2017;"Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) shares rallied 24% over the past 12 months,   hitting a historic high and outperforming the S&P 500's 18%   gain. However, that rally also boosted Microsoft's trailing P/E   to 30, which is slightly higher than the industry average of 29   for business software companies.Some investors may believe that premium puts a near-term   ceiling over Microsoft's stock price. While that may be true,   Microsoft can still probably climb higher over the long term   thanks to three major catalysts.Image source: Pixabay.makeArticleAd();1. Its growing cloud ecosystemBack in 2015, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella declared that    Microsoft would generate $20 billion in annual cloud   revenues by the end of fiscal 2018. At the time, its commercial   cloud businesses had an annual run rate of $6.3 billion. That   figure  topped $14 billion last quarter -- indicating that   it could hit Nadella's target and account for nearly a fifth of   the company's estimated revenues in  2018.Most of Microsoft's cloud revenues come from its main cloud   services, Office 365, Outlook, and the Dynamics CRM (customer   relationship management) platform. A smaller portion comes from   its cloud platform Azure, which lends out storage, computing   power, analytics, and development tools to enterprise customers.   Microsoft doesn't disclose Azure's exact sales figures, but it   claimed that its revenue rose 93% annually and its computing   usage more than doubled last quarter. All that growth could   offset Microsoft's biggest weakness -- its slowing sales of   Windows licenses.2. Its disruptive moves into new marketsMicrosoft's biggest mistake over the past decade was missing   the technological shift toward mobile devices, which left it   chained to the aging PC platform as iOS and Android devices   flooded the market. But under Nadella, Microsoft is pushing back   with disruptive moves of its own.Its acquisition of LinkedIn enhances Dynamics with  more   enterprise data, which can help it challenge CRM market leaderSalesforce(NYSE: CRM) . Tighter connections between LinkedIn, Office 365,   and Outlook can also widen the moat of its enterprise tools   against challengers like Google's G Suite. Microsoft's recent   introduction of Teams, which merges Skype for Business, Office   365, OneNote, and other features on a cloud-based collaboration   platform, counters similar platforms like Slack andCisco's Spark.Microsoft's HoloLens. Image source: Microsoft.Microsoft also made bold moves on the hardware front. It   recently announced that it had alreadysold ""thousands""of  HoloLens AR headset development kits, and the    upcoming Windows 10 Creators update will add 3D image   capture and editing tools to let artists and developers create 3D   objects which can be viewed in the headset. Microsoft also   announced that  its hardware partners will launch high-end   VR headsetsstarting at $300-- about half the price of an Oculus Rift. Those moves could all   put Microsoft ahead of the tech curve again.3. Embracing ARM-based devices, Android, and     iOSMicrosoft once had a misplaced devotion to x86 processors and   its own operating system. By sticking withIntel's(NASDAQ: INTC) x86 chips instead of supporting ARM chips,   Microsoft locked itself out of the smartphone and tablet markets,   which overwhelmingly used ARM's more power-efficient processors.   The company eventually pivoted toward ARM chips with Windows RT   and Windows Phone, but apps for those devices were initially   incompatible with older x86-based machines.To move past that awkward phase, Microsoft launched new   versions of Windows 10 which were  fully compatible with   both Intel's x86 chips andQualcomm's(NASDAQ: QCOM) ARM-based Snapdragon chips. It also recently   announced that it will run its Azure cloud platform on    Qualcomm's ARM-based Centriq 2400 server solutions. These   moves could hurt Intel's dominance of the PC and data center   markets.As for mobile devices, it's clear that Windows Phone and   Windows 10 Mobile -- which runs on less than  1% of   smartphones worldwide -- were failures. But instead of pushing   out more expensive hardware, Microsoft downsized its mobile   business and focused on launching more apps for Android and iOS.   This meant that PC users could still access Microsoft's Office   365, Outlook, OneDrive, and other services on the go even if they   didn't own a Windows Phone -- which keeps Microsoft relevant in    the ""mobile-first, cloud-first world"" which Nadella   discussed at the beginning of his tenure.The key takeawaysUnder former CEO Steve Ballmer, Microsoft complacently milked   its Windows and Office cash cows. That complacency caused it to   miss the shift toward cloud services and mobile devices, but   Satya Nadella seems to know how to get the company back on   track.Under Nadella, Microsoft is focusing on the businesses that   work, like the cloud, and reducing its exposure to costly mobile   hardware. Microsoft is also investing in the future by expanding   its enterprise ecosystem and developing new AR and VR hardware.   To me, all these moves indicate that Microsoft's best days are   still ahead.10 stocks we like better than MicrosoftWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Is This NVIDIA's Next Big Opportunity?;3/11/2017;"Image source: NVIDIA.Gaming isNVIDIA's(NASDAQ: NVDA) biggest revenue source while the automotive   business is said to be its nextbig play. However, the company's data center business -- which hasAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) andMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) as clients -- is putting both gaming and   automotive to shame in terms of growth.makeArticleAd();Data from NVIDIA. Chart by author.The 205% year-over-year growth in NVIDIA's data center revenue   during the fourth quarter eclipsed both gaming and automotive,   which reported ""moderate"" growth of 66% and 37%, respectively   over the same time period. Data center is the company's   second-largest business, with over 13% of revenue, and it could   continue to grow for two reasons: the deployment of more data   centers and upgrades to the existing ones.Data centers will need more GPUsNowadays, the type and volume of information that data centers   process has become more complex than ever. The growing usage of   3D applications in virtualized workspace environments is creating   the need for high-performance computing that is enabled by GPUs.   Instead of deploying a 3D-graphics-enabled application on an   individual workstation, enterprises are now using the data center   to install the 3D apps so they can be accessed by users   remotely.Apart from the complexity, the volume of data processed in   data centers is also rising thanks to concepts such as the   Internet of Things.TheInternet of Thingsgenerates two categories of data. The first is the large data   type that consists of images and videos generated by different   electronic devices. The second is the passive or small data type   that is generated by different sensors and low-energy devices   powering the Internet of Things. As data centers handle both   these data types, they will need upgraded GPUs to enhance   computing speeds and control costs simultaneously.As it turns out, NVIDIA's Tesla GPUs for the data center   deliver on both counts -- faster speed and lower costs. These are   capable of enhancing computing speeds by five times and reduce   costs by 60%, according to Shanker Trivedi, the company's VP of   Enterprise Business. The advantages delivered by these GPUs have   allowed the company to rack up an impressive clientele in   datacenters, especially in high-performance computing.NVIDIA's GPUs are powering major cloud service providers such   as Amazon Web Services,GoogleCloud, Microsoft Azure, and Softlayer. The company's client list   in datacenters will continue expanding as global mobile data   traffic is expected to grow eightfold from 2015 to 2020, driven   by Internet of Things applications.The increasing data traffic will spawn the need for more   datacenters, with TechNavio forecasting that the global data   center market will grow 11% annually between 2016 and 2020. But,   apart from the construction of new datacenters, NVIDIA will also   benefit from the upgrades to the existing ones.Upgrades will drive GPU demandCloud service providers have started upgrading their existing   data centers to meet the rise in data volumes and tackle   complexity. Amazon, for example, upgraded its services using   NVIDIA's Tesla GPU accelerators late last year. Amazon Web   Services used eight Tesla accelerators, with each of them being   powered by a pair of GPUs.The NVIDIA GPUs were used to add a new virtual server, known   as P2, to Amazon's data center. The new server carries seven   times the computational capacity of Amazon's previous platform,   known as G2, which was running a legacy GPU.Similarly, Microsoft has also started offering a preview of   NVIDIA's accelerated data center solutions on the Azure platform   to give customers a taste of supercomputer-class performance.   Azure clients can now deploy professional grade graphics   solutions to remote workstations and accelerate their computing   speeds over the cloud. In this way, Microsoft is providing   infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) to its clients by upgrading   its existing data centers.The IaaS market will be worth $43 billion in 2020 as compared   to $22 billion last year, according to IDC. This will increase   the demand for NVIDIA's GPUs as they will be used to accelerate   computing power and capacity in data centers to enable IaaS   growth.The Foolish takeawayThe data center market is going to get bigger in the long run   and NVIDIA counts the biggest cloud service providers as its   clients. This will allow it to get more of its GPUs into data   centers to enable high-performance computing needs and eventually   boost its business.10 stocks we like better than NvidiaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Timeless Lessons From the 2017 DJCO Meeting – Part IV Last but Not Least;3/10/2017;"In my previous three articles, I have shared my notes and observations from the 2017Daily Journal Corp.(DJCO) meeting with each article focusing on one or two specific topics. Today's article is the last one of this series and I will cover a few other topics that I call miscellaneous (I am not heedingCharlie Munger(Trades,Portfolio) 's suggestion on avoiding sloth).On how specializing in life can make a big difference:""Generally, specialization is the way to go for most people. It's just I'm an example of something different. It's awkward for me because I don't want to encourage people to try to do it the way I did, because I only go to work for most people. The basic idea for being rational and disciplined and deferring gratification, those will work. But if you want to get rich the way I did, by learning a little bit about a hell of a lot, I don't recommend it to others.""makeArticleAd();""I basically think John Bogle is right about his basic approach, that people are not going to match the averages, and he is. His idea has succeeded and he's succeeded and he was right. On the other hand, he's kind of a one-trick pony. I don't think he has another ... he had one good idea in his lifetime. He rode it very hard. It's all you need. He's another example. He had one good idea, he pushed it hard and it worked. You don't need a lot of good ideas, but you do need one.""""Al Gore had come into you fellows' business. Al Gore is in your business and he has made 300 or 400 million dollars in your business. He's not very smart. He drank a lot, he smoked a lot of pot. Coaxed through Harvard with a gentleman's C. He had one obsessive idea, that global warming was a terrible thing, and he said he'd protect the world from it. His idea when he went into investment counseling is he was not going to put any carbon dioxide in the air. He found some partner to go into investment counseling with and he says, 'We're not going to have any carbon dioxide.' This partner's a value investor, a good one.What they did is Gore hired a staff to find people who didn't put carbon dioxide in the air. Of course, that put him into services companies.Microsoft(MSFT) and all these service companies who were just ideally located, and this value investor picked the best service companies. All of a sudden, the clients are making hundreds of millions of dollars and they're paying part of it to Al Gore. And now Al Gore has hundreds of millions of dollars in your profession and he's an idiot. It's an interesting story.""""There's a leveraged buyout operator in Los Angeles that I know casually. He's made 35% per annum for 30 years. All he buys is service companies. Instead of buying 100%, while leaving management to have 10, he always tries to buy 60 and let the old manager who created the company own the other 40. He buys nothing but services companies, and he knows a lot about it. With that formula, inventories, receivables, there are all kinds of horrible things in business that if you just buy service companies you can avoid. It's amazing how it's worked for this guy, who does the buyouts, it was just the way it worked for Al Gore. Thirty-five percent per annum. He's smart because he's causing people to have more of their own skin in the game, they know more about it. They're more like partners instead of ... the new manager's not an employee. If some other guy owns 40 and you own 60, that's a different relation-ship, and he's the founder. What a clever way to do it. And it worked better. Of course, he knows more about it when he does nothing but service companies.""""I know another guy who does nothing but mail order and internet companies. Also a leveraged buyout operator. He's made 20 some percent per annum for a long, long time. He knows more about getting customers and this ratio, he knows more about this damn mail order internet companies. He really knows a lot. Two specialists, each one with a different specialty. Both working, interesting. That's why I made all that talk about the specialization frequently works. I've had more fun to go on and do everything, but these specialists do better, averaged out. They know a lot.""On how to live a happy life:""Well it's all imitable. If your marriage reasonably works and if your family life reasonably works, and I don't mean perfectly because nobody's family life works perfectly, particularly with the children, and if your partnerships work well, we have had marvelous part-ners. Warren's been a marvelous partner for me, I've been a good partner with him. All of our other subsidiary partnerships, which don't overlap totally, have been marvelous. I do not have a big failed partnership of any kind. That's because I am a good partner and Warren is a good partner. You want a good spouse, deserve one. If you want to have a good partner, be a good partner. It's a very simple system and it's worked very well, and of course it wouldn't work very well without it. Also get rid of the bureaucracy. You deal with good people you trust. Expense, trouble, lawyers, checking, we're all closing something with no audit. We basically are very old-fashioned. We bought the Northern Natural pipelines. We needed money Monday and it was Saturday, it was lots of money. We just gave them the money and took the pipeline, worked out the details later. Other people can't do that. Their whole culture is there are all kinds of bureaucrats that want something to do, they can't make an exception.""On cloning:""Well cloning is, of course, it's not a very ambiguous word when you use it biologically, but when you take it into some other field, clon-ing is a very interesting idea. You do remove ideas from one place and bring them into another. If that's cloning, I do it all the time.It's a very plausible idea and I've encouraged one young man to look at it. I can hardly say that it has no merit. Of course, it's useful if I were you people to look at what you regard as great investors are doing for ideas. The trouble with it is that if you pick people as late in the game asBerkshire Hathaway(NYSE:BRK.A)(NYSE:BRK.B), our limitations caused by size.You really need to do it from some guy that's operating smaller places and finding places with more advantage. Of course, it's hard to identify the people in the small game, but it's not an idea that won't work. If I were you people, of course I would do that. I would want to know exactly what the smart people were doing, and I would look at every one of them. Of course. That would be a no-brainer for me.""I hope you enjoy Charlie's widsom as much as I do.Start afree 7-day trial of Premium Membershipto GuruFocus.Premium MembersThis article first appeared onGuruFocus."

Why General Electric Company (GE) Stock Is STILL a Powerhouse;3/10/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsInvestors should consider holding diversified companies as part of their investing strategy. These conglomerates operate in multinational jurisdictions, don't rely on a single sector for revenue and in some cases, pay out a regular dividend.makeArticleAd();Source:Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified)General Electric Company(NYSE:GE), whose shares are valued at just 15.7 times forward earnings, has a dividend yielding 3.2%.Its long-term debt (of 1.39x equity) is more than manageable. If GE stock dips more, this is the stock to consider. In the third quarter, General Electric was third only toMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) andApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) in buying back shares.In Q3, the company bought back $3.7 billion. Apple repurchased $6 billion, while Microsoft bought back $4.4 billion. GE returned $30.5 billion to shareholders last year. This included a share buyback of $22 billion.The company is not a favorite pick among the analysts, despite the respectable General Electric dividend. JPMorgan added GE stock as a top stock to avoid, citing sub-par core operating performance.8 Dividend Growth Stocks Raising The BarInvestors need not pay any attention to analysts there. General Electric has strong leadership under CEO Jeffrey Immelt. It is embracing technology by focusing on the Internet of Things with its ""smart machines"" development.Growth Potential of GE StockGeneral Electric's move to merge its oil and gas services business withBaker Hughes Incorporated(NYSE:BHI) is a net positive.The energy sector is uncertain and it faces slow growth. Despite the challenging oil and gas market ahead, GE stock still kept up with its pace of dividends and share buybacks. On its fourth-quarter conference call, General Electric saidthe sector is stabilizing:""In oil and gas, the environment continues to be challenging and activity levels remain muted, external market indicators appear to be stabilizing with expected more balanced supply and demand fundamentals, partly influenced by the recent OPEC production agreement. U.S. onshore rig count grew 33% versus the third quarter, but was essentially flat versus the beginning of the year.""Although orders fell 27% year-over-year, GE forecast no change in E&P spending. If the oil and gas market bottomed late last year, the company will start seeing orders growing at its Alstom unit.The offshore drilling and sub-sea will still be a drag this year. General Electric hopes business picks up in North America onshore. It also needs the Middle East and Europe to stabilize. If that does not happen, this segment will not meet the company's expectation of a smaller revenue decline in the second half of the year.General Electric's Earnings OutlookThe 2017 earnings-per-share forecast of $1.60 to $1.70 a share may prove too low an estimate for GE stock. In the meantime, management is continuing with its plans on returning between $19 billion to $21 billion to shareholders this year.General Electric reported respectable growth in many of its units. For example, revenue at HCS (health and life science) grew by 2 %. Immelt expects Aviation to grow again this year. GE is also improving its operating efficiency. A new IT structure that runs horizontally will save the company around $450 million.Investors shouldn't only consider General Electric the bellwether of the U.S. economy's health, as its prospects also depend on the health of the world economy. A strong ISM manufacturing indexnumber, which hit a two-year high, is just a one indicator suggesting GE stock's outlook is bright.As of this writing, Chris Lau did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 Dangerous Dividend Stocks to Dump Now7 Future Blue-Chip Stocks You Need to BuyThe postWhy General Electric Company (GE) Stock Is STILL a Powerhouseappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Tech Roundup: AAPL Shareholder Meet, MWC, XBox Game Pass, YouTube TV;3/10/2017;"makeZacksArticleAd();Last week was significant in many ways. Other than events like Apple'sAAPLshareholder meeting and the Mobile World Congress, there were two very important product launches in tech world: Microsoft'sMSFTXbox Game Pass and Alphabet'sGOOGLYouTube TV.So here are the top stories from last week:Apple Has Annual Shareholder MeetingAt the annual shareholder meeting, Apple considered nine proposals, of which four were its own and five came from shareholders. Only Apple's proposals were approved.On the product front, Apple promised that Mac Pro customers wouldn't be ignored in the push to launch better iPhones as the creative segment remained important to it. On the iPhone front, he expressed satisfaction that the current lineup of SE, 7 and 7 Plus generated sales that were above company expectations. Cook also said that that the airpods were a ""cultural phenomenon"".As far as other products are concerned, Apple is fighting to meet demand for the Watch Series 2 and working to launch other new products (possibly an AR device).Apple Pay adoption is slower in the U.S. than internationally, Apple Music subscribers are at 20 million and App Store subscribers (including those for services like Netflix) are now 150 million.Another important question addressed by the CEO was with respect to U.S. manufacturing. He said that two-thirds of Apple jobs were in the U.S. (Apple has created 2 million American jobs) and he would work to bring more. He also mentioned that Apple had paid out $50 billion to U.S. suppliers in 2016. In the meantime, favorable tax rules could see Apple bringing back more cash. While diversity remains a focus area, a proposal to make it more binding on management was shot down by shareholders.Apple remains committed to green initiatives and said that it was already running 93% of its operations on clean energy.Finally, on net neutrality, Cook said that while the company didn't engage in politics, it would be involved in policy formation. To that end, it would engage on net neutrality issues. Note that new FCC Chairman Ajit Pai recently said that net neutrality was a mistake, while Apple's position has always been that everyone's content should be treated equal.MWCLG, Sony, NokiaNOK, Samsung, Huawei, Motorola and Blackberry unveiled new devices at the Mobile World Congress 2017 held between Feb 27 and Mar 3. Some of the notable features of these devices are as follows:LG's all-new G6 smartphone got rid of the modular design of the G5 while also doing away with the removable battery (using a built-in 3,300mAh battery instead) and adding water and dust resistance, a rear mounted fingerprint scanner, USB Type C port and headphone jack.Sony had four phones on the show, the Mediatek P20-powered Xperia XA1 and XA1 Ultra and the Snapdragon 820-poweredXZ Premium and XZs. The XZs will run on the latest Android Nougat.Nokia, which is making a comeback this year showcased four models: the entry level Nokia 3, the mid-range Nokia 5 and Nokia 6 (based on the Symbian OS), and the feature phone Nokia 3310 that promises a 30-day battery life. The phones are relatively cheap and classy-looking.Samsung said it would have a launch event for the Galaxy S8 on Mar 29 and focused instead on the Galaxy Tab S3 with its 9.7-inch 2048x1536 (QXGA) Super AMOLED display, quad-core 2.15 GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 SoC and 4 GB of RAM. The device uses Android Marshmallow 6,000mAh batteryHuawei launched the 5.1-inch P10 and 5.5-inch P10 Plus, both of which run on the latest Android 7.0 Nougat, have 64-bit octa-core Hisilicon Kirin 960 processors with Mali-G71 MP8 GPUs. They were launched in 30 countries excluding the U.S. and Canada. It also announced the Android Wear 2.0-powered Watch 2 and Watch 2 Classic and the MediaPad T3 tablet.The KEYone from Blackberry was designed by TCL Communications of China came with its familiar physical keyboard. The convenience of the keyboard with its 52 shortcuts and increased security are the unique selling points.Lenovo/Motorola showed off the Moto G5 and Moto G5 Plus with the Plus having more of everything including size, snapdragon processor power, RAM and storage. But the cameras are comparable.Microsoft Launches Xbox Game PassMicrosoft has announced that it has a gaming subscription service in the works (i.e. it is in alpha testing). The service allows you access to 100 gaming titles for $9.99 a month. Unlike PlayStation Now, Sony's subscription service that only allows you to stream PS4 titles, Game Pass allows you to download the entire game for XB360 and XB1 so you can play uninterrupted without worrying about connectivity issues.If you like a game, the service allows you to buy it at a discount but if you don't, and happen to end your subscription, you lose access to the games completely. Some titles may be removed by a publisher during the month, but Microsoft says that most titles will be there right through the month before the list is refreshed, ensuring a constant and steady flow of games.Microsoft hopes that eventually Game Pass will become a platform that allows publishers to release their games on an episodic basis, much like TV programing. Publishers currently missing include Electronic ArtsEA, Ubisoft and Activision Blizzard but they will no doubt be there when it goes live. Also, the service is currently being tested for Xbox alone and plans to include Windows PCs have been shelved for now.Google Launches Youtube TVAlphabet's Google launched a live TV streaming service called YouTube TV that will stream 40 sporting and entertainment channels from CBS, ABC, NBC and Fox at $35 a month for a family of six. The service puts Google in direct competition against traditional operators like AT&TTwith its DirecTV Now, DISH NetworksDISHwith its Sling TV and CBS with its All Access.

Sears Holdings Corp (SHLD) Soars Amid Potential for More Closings;3/10/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSears Holdings Corp(NASDAQ:SHLD) shares were up by double digits on Friday amid what appears to be optimism over the possibility of more store closures prompting a short squeeze in SHLD stock.makeArticleAd();Source:Mike Mozart via FlickrSears is coming off afourth-quarter beat on the top and bottom lines, but with still-horrid numbers. Revenues in Q4 were down more than 16% to $6.1 billion, and the company lost $607 million.Nonetheless, SHLD stock rebounded by 7%-plus Thursday, and now is up another 15% on Friday.Business Insider's Hayley Peterson writes that the company's conference call points to thepossibility of more store closings and sales. CFO Jason Hollar said:""We have a valuable real estate portfolio, which at the end of the fourth quarter comprised 1,050 leases with significant optionality, as well as 380 owned stores, many in prominent locations.

Large Cap ETF (IVV) Tops $100 billion in AUM;3/10/2017;"makeZacksArticleAd();Large cap ETFs are leading the current market rally driven by a combination of factors such as Trump trade, strongest Q4-earnings growth in two years, solid economic data, stabilizing oil price and growing prospects of rate hike (read:March Rate Hike in the Cards: Bet on These Inverse Treasury ETFs).Hopes of Trump's pro-growth policies including big spending, reduced regulations and tax cuts are continuously instilling investors' confidence in economic growth and inflation. Additionally, the U.S. economy is on solid ground courtesy of an impressive labor market, rising wages, and increasing consumer spending. Americans have an optimistic view of the economy with confidence hitting the highest level in more than 15 years and comfort reaching to the highest point in a decade.This is especially true, as the Conference Board consumer confidence index jumped to 114.8 in February from a revised 111.6 in January. The Consumer Comfort Index rose to 50.6 in the period ended March from 49.8. Further, solid Q4 corporate earnings, which reached an all-time quarterly record with the highest growth in two years, added to the strength (read:5 High Beta ETFs & Stocks for a Soaring Market).Moreover, global fundamentals have improved with resilient recovery in Europe, stabilizing China, and battling deflation in Japan that have receded fears of slowdown.All these good tidings have encouraged investors to pour their money into equity ETFs. In particular,iShares Core S&P 500 ETFIVVhas accumulated nearly $4 billion in capital so far this year, pushing total AUM of the fund to more than $100 billion. Investors should note that IVV is the second ETF in the space that has managed to garner $100 billion in AUM after the ultra-popular SPDR S&P 500SPYhit the similar milestone a decade ago.Inside Investors' LoveThe jump in IVV's AUM has been rapid compared to other large cap funds. This is because the ETF assets have moved up from $65 billion a year ago. The major reason for the success is lower fees and the surge in IVV's underlying index -- the S&P 500. Blackrock cut fees for the ETF by 3 bps to 0.04% in October that made IVV one of the low-cost choices in the large cap space (read:Buy These ETFs as BlackRock Cuts Fees).The S&P 500 index has been on a stellar run since the election, hitting all-time highs on several occasions. As a result, it gained nearly 6% since election and 17% over the one-year period.IVV in FocusThe fund holds 505 stocks in its basket with none accounting for more than 3.63% of assets. AppleAAPL, MicrosoftMSFTand Johnson & JohnsonJNJare the top three elements in the fund's portfolio. IVV is widely spread across a number of sectors with information technology, financials, health care, and consumer discretionary making up for a double-digit allocation each. It currently has a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 or 'Hold' rating with a Medium risk outlook.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks' free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.Get it free >>Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Is More Expensive Than Alphabet Inc (GOOGL);3/10/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIt's not by much, but it's there.Alphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL), the parent of Google, was valued at 30.35 times last year's earnings as the market opened March 10.Microsoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT), the parent of Windows, was valued at 30.48 times earnings.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockSeen solely through the prism of financial reports, this makes no sense. Microsoft revenue for its fiscal 2016 was its lowest in three years. Alphabet's margins remain superior and its top line was up 20% in 2016 - ""The Google"" recorded more revenues than ""Mister Softy"" for its most recent fiscal year.Why all the investor love for MSFT stock?Credit the transformation engineered by CEO Satya Nadella, and a new enterprise buying cycle. Simply put, the cloud is where the action is, and Microsoft has essentially becomeInternational Business Machines Corp.(NYSE:IBM), the default choice for running cloud applications.Cloud App DominanceEnterprises - that is large businesses, governments and institutions - are finally moving to the cloud in the form of cloud applications. These include software used for collaboration, marketing, planning, human resources, and for information management.7 Future Blue-Chip Stocks You Need to BuyThe importance of this market, and its potential, can be seen in the recent action of IBM. Its revenues and margins improved dramatically during its most recent quarter, and the stock has risen 28% over the last year. IBM's price-to-earnings metric is still in the mid-teens, but if it can keep the top-line momentum growing when it reports next month, it could be a buy.Synergy Research writes this week, however, thatMicrosoft is leading the enterprise application charge. They are a leader in half the niches identified by the research company, the only cloud software firm identified in more than one area.The one area where GOOGL is even competitive, writes Synergy, is cloud collaboration, shared office applications like Microsoft Office 365 and, on Google's side, the G Suite. Microsoft took the overall market lead in the second quarter of last year and has not looked back.You can start to see the turn in the last few quarterly reports. MSFT revenues of $24.09 billion were up nearly 20% from the previous quarter's $20.45 billion, and more than 20% of that money hit the net income line. Alphabet had more revenue, $26.06 billion, but slightly less of that money fell to net income.Remember: What matters with stocks isn't what you did, but what you're doing, and what you can be expected to do. Expectations for MSFT stock are suddenly sky-high. Thus Microsoft's earnings are worth more.This week, Alphabet tried to halt that momentum at its Google Cloud Next event. How well it succeeded won't be known for some time, although it wasmaking big claims.That Google faces a challenge an enterprise challenge in cloud, however, is now undeniable. It's why the company did an ""acqui-hire"" of VMware co-founderDiane Greenein 2015, making her the head of Google Cloud in 2015, three years after joining the parent company's board.Experts Like BothInvestorPlacewriters are clued-in to the Microsoft momentum, which has the stock up 24% over the last year, outstripping Alphabet's 17% gain.Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock Is MUCH More Than RyzenJosh Enomotoinsists the company is not overbought,Chris Lausays not to worry, andWill Ashworthexplained howLinkedInbecomes the human glue tying all this together.This doesn't mean you should sell out your GOOGL positions and buy MSFT stock. I have both, and believeGoogle still has unrealized potentialon the consumer side of the market. Serge Berger agrees.It's still the one, he writes.But it does mean you want to look closely at cloud applications for profits this year. It does mean that MSFT stock is no longer a client software play, but a cloud play, and that its best days may yet be ahead of it.Dana Blankenhornis a financial and technology journalist.

IBM Cloud Solutions to Support DSK Bank's Operations;3/10/2017;"makeZacksArticleAd();International Business Machines CorporationIBMand Bulgaria's biggest bank, DSK Bank, jointly announced the successful migration of the bank's operations to IBM's datacenters. The migration is a part of the long-term IT services agreement between IBM and the bank.As part of the deal, IBM will provide after-sales support related to IBM Cloud infrastructure on which the bank's operations run.Benefits for DSKDSK Bank has switched to the cloud to enhance its core banking platform as well as introduce new services for over three million individual and business customers.More specifically, the bank will now be able to better serve the net savvy generation with services such as mobile banking and net banking.

Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock Is MUCH More Than Ryzen;3/10/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe past couple of weeks have been … well, interesting ones forAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMD) shareholders. AMD stock, after more than quintupling over the course of the prior 12  months, fell 16% in just four days a week ago and has struggled to pick itself up off the mat in the meantime.makeArticleAd();Source:Matthew Rutledge via FlickrThe prod for the pullback? Reports that its new (and well-hyped) computer processor wasn't performing quite as well as expected once put to the test in real-world applications.As Ars Technica reviewer Mark Walton put it:""The [Ryzen] 1800X lags behind its Intel counterparts in gaming, regardless of whether it's running at the same clock speed or higher.""It was a real blow to optimistic investors, who had bid AMD stock up in a big way on hopes that the new CPU would be the centerpiece of a turnaround story. Now that story is in question.Thing is, the Ryzen may not be as central to the company's rebound as it's been made it to be. Indeed, Advanced Micro Devices has a lot more going for it besides the new CPU that investors aren't giving it credit for. Three specific items come to mind. Note than a handful of AMD's competitors are now becoming partners.3 Things AMD Still Has Going For ItWhile investors had high expectations for Ryzen, the future for Advanced Micro Devices isn't dependent on it. In fact, there are three other areas that may end up meaning even more for its top and bottom lines.9 Stocks to Buy That Are Growing Faster Than AmazonIn no particular order …Penetrating the Cloud Market:While AMD has always had a presence in most key tech markets, cloud computing was never a key one for the company. That's changing now though… a ball that got rolling just in the past few weeks. In November,Alphabet Inc's(NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google division tapped AMD,looking to add its graphical processor units to Google's machine learning architecture.It's a curious development, as GPU chips weren't designed to do anything more than handle a computer's display screen. As it turns out, though, its GPUs are very capable of parallel computing, which is a critical aspect of this new cloud-based function.In the meantime,Microsoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) selected AMD processors to power its next-generation open course cloud platform.At stake is a piece of the cloud infrastructure market worth an estimated $300 billion per year.More Licensing Revenue:It's only an unconfirmed rumor thus far, but a reasonably credible one. That is,Intel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) is reportedly interested in using AMDs Radeon graphics technology to power Intel's integrated GPUs in future computers … displacingNvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA). The agreement between Nvidia and Intel ends at the end of March.At the very least, the prospect of such an IP licensing deal could mean a couple hundred million dollars in annual high-margin revenue. If Intel really wants to step up its game, though, it could help fund improvements in the way its CPUs handle graphics.New GPUs Will Enhance New CPU Revenue:While the reviews for the new Ryzen processor have been mixed, AMD stock holders should bear in mind that they're only half the next generation of hardware for Advanced Micro Devices.The other half of the one-two punch combination for AMD this year is the new Vega GPU, which should be unveiled around the middle of this year.As was noted back on Feb. 7:""Vega, is a second-generation high bandwidth memory (or HBM2) design found on a stacked-memory architecture that performs significantly better than the more common GDDR5 (double data rate type-five) utilized by most graphics processing units today. An essentially-infinite amount of memory can be dedicated to handling the display - the maximum virtualization is capped at a ridiculous 512 terabytes. This platform is about twice as powerful as most current alternatives, and will make Advanced Micro Devices competitive with the newest generation of GPU architecture from Nvidia, called Pascal.""More important, Vega was largely built with the Ryzen processor in mend, with each getting the most performance out of one another.Snap Inc (SNAP) Stock Is the Perfect Buy at This PriceIn the meantime, it's not like the Ryzen CPU is a lost cause.As the company's CEO Lisa Su recently explained, ""We hear people on wanting to see improved 1080p performance and we fully expect that Ryzen performance in 1080p will only get better as developers get more time with 'Zen.' We have over 300+ developers now working with 'Zen' and several of the developers for Ashes of Singularity and Total [War:] Warhammer are actively optimizing now.""Bottom Line for AMD StockAs encouraging as the future may be for the company whether or not Ryzen ends up performing well, there's still no denying that AMD stock is overbought and ripe for some profit-taking; that 16% dip is nothing compared to 2016's huge rally.But don't confuse any future weakness from AMD as evidence of what's in store, results-wise, from the company. Advanced Micro Devices is very well positioned for a great 2017. The trick is just being patient enough to wait for a truly palatable entry price. That could still be well below the recent low.In other words, you don't want to step into AMD stock for the long haul until it's almost uncomfortable to do so. We aren't there yet.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace3 Reasons Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

Can You Beat the S&P 500 with an Index Fund?;3/10/2017;"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL - Investors focus in on the S&P 500 as a benchmark, and for good reason. The index is one of the most popular, liquid, and diversified benchmarks out there. But is there an easy way to beat its performance with a slight strategy tilt? We explore this idea in the latest edition of the Dutram Report and get to the bottom of the 'equal weight' strategy. To listen to the podcast, click here: (https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/252308/Can-You-Beat-the-SampP-500-at-Its-Own-Game).The S&P 500 isthebenchmark for most investors.The important stock index consists of 500 of the largest companies that are listed on the NYSE or the Nasdaq, and securities are weighted in the benchmark by market capitalization levels. Currently, top stocks in the benchmark include AppleAAPLat about 3.6% of the total, MicrosoftMSFTat 2.5% of the total, and Exxon MobilXOMat 1.65%.But while this approach is a great barometer for market health, is it the best way for investors to put their money to work? Investors have numerous options in this department, including products likeSPY,VOO, orIVV, as these simply follow the benchmark exactly as laid-out by the index creators. But is there a potentially better way?Enter Equal WeightIn this edition ofthe Dutram Report, I look for an alternate approach in a talk to Michael Willis, the lead portfolio manager ofINDEX Funds. His key product, the Index Funds S&P 500 Equal WeightINDEXtakes the same S&P 500 stocks, but invests in them equally.This means that instead of Apple accounting for nearly 4% of the total, or Microsoft making up 2.5% of the fund, each account for roughly 0.2% of the total, at least at rebalancing dates. And not just the mega caps, but each and every stock comes with this same weight, giving the fund an equal interest in giants like Exxon, and the smallest S&P 500 components alike.While this might sound like a small difference, we go over in the podcast how this actually ends up being something very important to overall returns. Michael discusses how nearly half of the S&P 500 (market cap weighted) is tied up in about 50 companies, and that the remaining 450 have to fight over the remainder. He argues that the equal weight is a much more balanced way to achieve exposure, while thefund's fact sheetshows that this approach has outperformed the market over long time periods.We also talk about the pros and cons of this approach, such as its potentially heavier weighting in mid-cap securities and what this means for investors, as well as some important fund specifics. This includes information regarding the cost and minimum investment, and also the reason for selecting a fund structure. We then go over the ways that INDEX differs from the ETF counterpart out there, the Guggenheim S&P 500 Equal Weight ETFRSP, looking beyond the lower cost of INDEX when compared to the Guggenheim fund.Bottom LineEqual weight investing is an overlooked strategy for targeting stocks, but it is clearly one that can lead to outperformance over long time periods. If you are curious about this approach, check out this podcast for everything you need to know about how it works, and if this can help improve returns for long-term investors.So, make sure to listen to this edition ofthe Dutram Reportfor a closer look at equal weight investing, and what the pros and cons of this approach are for those seeking a different way to play the S&P 500.

Stocks to Buy: 3 Tech Stocks Paying Nice Dividends;3/9/2017;"Many of the bestdividend   stocksare found in sectors where the rate of change and disruption is   slow -- sectors like consumer staples, utilities, and banks. But   there are some excellent dividend stocks in the tech sector, too.Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) ,IBM(NYSE: IBM) , andMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) , for instance, all pay solid, growing   dividends.Here's a look at why each of these tech giants represents a   good bet for investors looking for income.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();Apple: dividend upsideApple offers the smallest dividend yield -- 1.6% -- of these   three stocks. But investors shouldn't overlook its   attractiveness. Apple's dividend easily makes up what it lacks in   yield with growth potential.Currently, Apple is paying out just 27% of its earnings,   leaving significant upside for dividend increases in the future.   Further, management has demonstrated how it's prioritizing   dividend growth since the company initiated its dividend in 2012.   Adjusted for a 7-to-1 stock split in 2014, Apple's dividend has   increased 50% since 2012.Apple's annual dividend increases have steadily remained at   about 10% -- a rate the company looks like it could sustain for   years to come.IBM: an above-average yieldWith a dividend yield of about 3.1%, IBM has the fattest   per-share payout of these three stocks. Even more, while IBM's   44% payout ratio -- the percentage of annual earnings it is   paying out in dividends -- is well above Apple's 27% payout   ratio, it's still low enough for investors to expect meaningful   dividend growth for years to come.Indeed, IBM's dividend has grown at a very healthy average   annualized rate of about 14% during the past five years. However,   the company's most recent dividend increase wasn't as substantial   as in past years. In 2016, IBM's dividend increased 7.7%, down   from an 18.2% hike in 2015, as the company'songoing transformationhas put pressure on net income.Despite the slowdown in IBM's dividend increases, the   company's 21 consecutive years of dividend increases, along with   its low payout ratio, set a solid precedent for ongoing dividend   increases over the long haul.Microsoft: enduring cash flow from a profitable business   modelMicrosoft's ability to generate heady levels of cash flow from   its profitable business model is undeniable. For the past 10   years, Microsoft's gross profit margin, or gross profit as a   percentage of revenue, has been between about 61% and 81%. Sure,   the software giant's gross profit margin is on the low end of   this range today -- at 61%. But the inherent profitability of   Microsoft's software-focused business, combined with the   stickiness of its Office suite and its enterprise applications   and services, means it can count on enduring cash flow for years   to come, to continue feeding investors solid dividends.Image source: Getty Images.With a 2.4% dividend yield, Microsoft offers investors a   better dividend yield than Apple, but it's still well behind   IBM's 3.1% dividend yield. While Microsoft's payout ratio of   69.5% is higher than IBM's, Microsoft's dividend as a percentage   of free cash flow -- at 42% -- better captures the software   giant's room for dividend increases. Recent one-time charges   against earnings and restructuring charges have suppressed net   income and pushed the company's payout ratio higher. By   comparison, Apple and IBM are paying out 23% and 41% of their   free cash flow in dividends.Microsoft's most recent annual increase was 8% -- and the   company's financials look set to support similar increases over   time.In general, income investors may not find many great dividend   stocks in tech. But these three stocks are just as worthy of a   spot in an income portfolio as go-to Dividend Aristocrats in   consumer staples, utilities, and banking.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run     for over a decade,Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has tripled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy right now... and Apple wasn't one of them!

9 Blue-Chip Stocks This Top Money Manager Likes;3/9/2017;"Many investors began to drool over the energy and financial   sectors after the November elections. The prospect of lower   corporate tax rates and less restrictive regulatory yokes was a   big reason. But Larry Puglia, manager of $34.2 billion T.   Rowe Price Blue Chip Growth Fund (TRBCX), began to place a lot of new bets on the technology sector.That's despite the fact that the tech sector stands to benefit   less from changes in corporate taxes. Many tech companies already   have less-than-peak rates, Puglia says. In addition, tech   industry leaders worry that President Trump's immigration   policies could deprive them of skilled workers. Also, investors   feared there was friction between President Trump andAmazon(AMZN) CEO Jeff Bezos, who also owns the Washington Post, over the   newspaper's campaign coverage.But Puglia feels the benefit to corporations - including many   tech companies - of repatriation of bank accounts stuffed   with cash has been overlooked somewhat. And Puglia thinks the   likelihood of antagonism between the tech sector and the White   House is overblown. ""We do not think that would happen to a great   degree,"" Puglia said.makeArticleAd();Puglia's warm outlook for tech is reflected in   the fund's most recently disclosed top-10 additions in the   past six months. They included not only banking giantJPMorgan Chase(JPM), but also techiesMicrosoft(MSFT),NXP Semiconductors(NXPI),Alibaba Group(BABA),PayPal Holdings(PYPL),Priceline(PCLN) andFacebook(FB).Fast-food restaurant operatorYum Brands(YUM) was another top-10 addition. And the fund began a new   position in brokerageCharles Schwab(SCHW) that was large enough to also enter its top 10.IBD'S TAKE:As the Trump agenda continues to steer the stock market,     readIBD LeaderboardandThe Big Pictureevery day to find highly rated stocks and sectors     poised to move higher.Puglia's moves are worth watching. Going into Thursday, his   fund's 14.64% average annual gain over the prior five years   outperformed 94% of its large-cap growth rivals tracked by   Morningstar Inc. The S&P 500's 14.00% pace also trailed. He's   in the top 84% year to date, which marks a rebound from 2016's   modest 0.98% gain.Progress Of Puglia's PortfolioJPMorgan shot higher shortly before Election Day. After four   quarters of declining earnings per share, EPS grew 1%, 20% and   20% in the past three stanzas. Like other banks, JPMorgan   benefits from investors' expectations that this corner of   financial services will face a lighter regulatory burden than it   would have under a Democratic-held White House or Congress. In   addition, banks are expected to carve out wider net margins as   interest rates increase. They are not expected to raise interest   paid to depositors by much if any, yet they will be able to   charge more for loans.Microsoft is well-positioned to keep on generating strong   growth in its Office 365 suite of products, Puglia says. He   also likes the outlook for its corporate cloud operations and   Azure, its public cloud-computing platform.Chipmaker NXP is a leading provider of semiconductor solutions   used in automotive connectivity and infotainment, he says. NXP's   chips are also used in smartphone near-field communications   payment applications. On Tuesday,Qualcomm(QCOM) extended its takeover bid for NXP until April 4.Alibaba offers consumer-to-consumer e-commerce services   through its Taobao business and it runs T-Mall, a   business-to-consumer platform. Both have dominant market share,   Puglia says. Alibaba is also a leader in cloud processing   services. The Chinese government is a key customer. Trading   around 103 as of early Thursday, shares are below a 104.67   cup-with-handle entry.Money-transfer services provider PayPal has a five-year   earnings annual growth rate of 25%. And it has reached deals withMastercard(MA) andVisa(V) that are mutually beneficial, Puglia says. Many investors had   feared a more adversarial competition among the three companies.   And Puglia likes PayPal's Venmo, Braintree and One Touch   services.Trading around 43, shares are still trading just under a 43.17   buy point of a cup-with-handle base. EPS grew 9%, 13% and 17% in   the past three quarters.Priceline gapped up nearly 6% on Feb. 28, a day after   reporting a 32% increase in fourth-quarter EPS. Its top line grew   17% to $2.34 billion. Both earnings and revenue topped the   company's own guidance. Hotel bookings have been the stock's   largest growth driver. Airline ticket sales fell. That's despite   steadily lowoil   prices, which have helped keep airfares down. The company's EPS grew   12%, 23% and 32% the past three quarters.Facebook sharesare up 20% this year. Investors have begun to appreciate how   well the company's advertising products, video strategy and   Instagram photo sharing are being received, Puglia   says. He adds that its investment in WhatsApp and Messenger   also provides solid positioning in the messaging market,   which is growing in popularity. ""We especially like the   company's efforts to promote the use of video on its   platform and to better monetize Instagram and video,"" he   said.Facebook reportedly made the launch of its Facebook Live video   service a priority last year. But enough users have posted videos   of violence and crime to make at least some advertisers wary of   the platform, according to CNBC.com. Facebook also has been hit   with measurement controversies.Yum shares rose 9% this year through Feb. 13 to a 52-week   high, but they've pulled back 7% since then. That has left   them a scant 3% above where they were when Yum spun off its   China division last Oct. 31. After EPS grew 44% for three   quarters in a row, EPS grew 18% in Q4.Schwab has done a nice job of growing customer assets under   management, Puglia wrote. ""Its earnings should benefit   substantially from rising interest rates,"" Puglia added. ""This is   enhanced by the fact that Schwab has a significant   bank embedded within the company. That enables it to sweep   brokerage deposits into the bank, creating more net interest   income.""Rain fell on Schwab's parade recently when it got caught up in   apricing warwith Fidelity Investments and TDAmeritrade(AMTD) over brokerage commissions. But Puglia says Schwab is far   less dependent on commissions thanTD Ameritradeis.RELATED:12 Blue-Chip Beauties That This Top Money     Manager Likes NowDoes Your Mutual Fund Manager Have Skin In The     Game?

Cavium Inc.'s Thunder X2 Aims for Microsoft Corporation's Cloud;3/9/2017;"Data center chipmakerCavium(NASDAQ: CAVM) announced on March 8 that it is ""collaborating   withMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) on evaluating and enabling a variety of cloud   workloads running on [its] flagship Thunder X2 ARMv8-A Data   Center processor for the Microsoft Azure cloud platform.""The announcement goes on to say that Cavium and Microsoft are   ""demonstrating web services on a version of Windows Server   developed for Microsoft's internal use running cloud services   workloads on Thunder X2.""Image source: Intel.makeArticleAd();This announcement is similar to one that fellow ARM-based   server processor makerQualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM)made at the same time.Let's take a closer look at what this announcement means for   Cavium in the near term and potentially over the long term.Near term? Probably not muchThe wording of Cavium's press release appears carefully   constructed to avoid giving the impression that Microsoft is   planning to buy and deploy a bunch of Cavium's Thunder X2 chips   in its data centers anytime soon.Indeed, the phrases ""evaluating and enabling"" as well as the   word ""demonstrating"" seem aways away from ""planning to deploy in   significant quantities.""So, in the near term, I don't expect the joint work that   Microsoft and Cavium are doing to lead to significant revenue for   Cavium anytime soon. The work that these two companies are doing   is much more likely to lay the groundwork for Microsoft to be   able to deploy potential successors to the Thunder X2 -- should   those products meet Microsoft's needs for certain workloads.Taking a longer-term viewAt this point, it's starting to look as though Cavium and   Qualcomm are the only two merchant ARM-based server processor   vendors left in in the game (there are companies building chips   for their own internal use like Huawei, for example).Cavium's edge appears to be its heritage is as a data   center/networking processor vendor (Qualcomm hails from a mobile   processor background), but Qualcomm has significantly greater   financial resources to try to slug it out with market incumbentIntel(NASDAQ: INTC) .It's likely not going to be easy for either company to wrest   away significant market share from Intel to begin with (which   invests more in data center-specific technologies and marketing   than either Qualcomm or Cavium -- probably more than both   combined), and that difficulty is compounded by the fact that   Cavium and Qualcomm must compete against each other, too.Success for ARM server chip vendors like Qualcomm and Cavium   is, in general, not something that's guaranteed to come at all,   and if it does come, it'll be hard won over multiple years after   substantial investments in research and development,   software/ecosystem enablement, and marketing efforts.It's worth noting that on Cavium's most recent earnings call,   CEO Syed Ali said that the company ""expect[s] to release [its]   next generation products"" in 2017. Given that the company had   previously said that it would begin sampling Thunder X2 in the   beginning of 2017, I'd expect shipments for revenue to occur late   in the year.What investors need to keep an eye on, then, is what kind of   revenue ramp Cavium ultimately begins to experience with Thunder   X2 and the impact it starts having on the company's financials,   independent of this announcement from Microsoft.10 stocks we like better than Cavium NetworksWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Can You Beat the S&P 500 at Its Own Game?;3/9/2017;"The S&P 500 isthebenchmark for most investors.The important stock index consists of 500 of the largest companies that are listed on the NYSE or the Nasdaq, and securities are weighted in the benchmark by market capitalization levels. Currently, top stocks in the benchmark include Apple (AAPL) at about 3.6% of the total, Microsoft (MSFT) at 2.5% of the total, and Exxon Mobil (XOM) at 1.65%.But while this approach is a great barometer for market health, is it the best way for investors to put their money to work? Investors have numerous options in this department, including products likeSPY,VOO, orIVV, as these simply follow the benchmark exactly as laid-out by the index creators. But is there a potentially better way?Enter Equal WeightIn this edition ofthe Dutram Report, I look for an alternate approach in a talk with Michael Willis, the lead portfolio manager of INDEX Funds. His key product, the Index Funds S&P 500 Equal Weight (INDEX), takes the same S&P 500 stocks, but invests in them equally.This means that instead of Apple accounting for nearly 4% of the total, or Microsoft making up 2.5% of the fund, each account for roughly 0.2% of the total, at least at rebalancing dates. And not just the mega caps, but each and every stock comes with this same weight, giving the fund an equal interest in giants like Exxon, and the smallest S&P 500 components alike.While this might sound like a small difference, we go over in the podcast how this actually ends up being something very important to overall returns. Michael discusses how nearly half of the S&P 500 (market cap weighted) is tied up in about 50 companies, and that the remaining 450 have to fight over the remainder. He argues that the equal weight is a much more balanced way to achieve exposure, while thefund's fact sheetshows that this approach has outperformed the market over long time periods.We also talk about the pros and cons of this approach, such as its potentially heavier weighting in mid-cap securities and what this means for investors, as well as some important fund specifics. This includes information regarding the cost and minimum investment, and also the reason for selecting a fund structure. We then go over the ways that INDEX differs from the ETF counterpart out there, the Guggenheim S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (RSP), looking beyond the lower cost of INDEX when compared to the Guggenheim fund.Bottom LineEqual weight investing is an overlooked strategy for targeting stocks, but it is clearly one that can lead to outperformance over long time periods. If you are curious about this approach, check out this podcast for everything you need to know about how it works, and if this can help improve returns for long-term investors.So, make sure to listen to this edition ofthe Dutram Reportfor a closer look at equal weight investing, and what the pros and cons of this approach are for those seeking a different way to play the S&P 500.

Apple Inc. Should Thank WikiLeaks for Its CIA Reveal;3/9/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOn Tuesday, WikiLeaks released ""Vault 7,"" a huge collection of documents that reveal hacking tools used by the CIA. While the dump paints the CIA in an unflattering light, the fallout may well be worse for some of the world's largest tech companies, includingApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL).makeArticleAd();Source: AppleSpecifically, the CIA has a long list of iOS exploits it has used to gain access to iPhones. Despite being named along with numerous other giants of tech, the latest WikiLeaks dump actually highlights a key advantage for Apple in particular.And while its aura of security may emerge tarnished, the iPhone may actually come out ahead over the long term thanks to WikiLeaks.What Was in WikiLeaks Vault 7?The latestWikiLeaks dump involves 8,761 documentsoutlining a wide range of CIA hacking tools, including viruses, malware, zero-day exploits, trojans and remote control systems.In addition there are 14 iOS exploits listed, several dozen Android vulnerabilities and methods for accessing encrypted chats (essentially reading the contentsbeforethey are encrypted by gaining access to the host device).9 Stocks to Buy That Are Growing Faster Than AmazonIt's not all smartphones, either. The CIA has developedmalware to infect computersrunning macOS, Windows and Linux. It's even capable of turning Samsung Smart TVs on their owners, using them as listening devices to record conversations.This Doesn't Look Good for AppleApple has long positioned itself as a privacy advocate. It has always played up the security of the iPhone and evenrefused an FBI request to unlock the iPhoneused by a shooter in 2015's San Bernardino terrorist attack.Apple CEO Tim Cook released a written statement at the time, saying:""… the U.S. government has asked us for something we simply do not have, and something we consider too dangerous to create. They have asked us to build a backdoor to the iPhone.""The WikiLeaks Vault 7 release made it clear that iOS wasn't as secure as Apple had thought.How Apple Could Come Out AheadWikiLeaks is bad news for Apple in the short term. But the reveal of CIA hacking of mobile devices and consumer electronics could actually be good news for the company in the long run. Apple quickly went on record as saying many of the vulnerabilities identified in the WikiLeaks Vault 7 documentswere already addressed with iOS 10. And it is working to identify and patch any new issues.Apple and Google chose very different strategies when it comes to smartphones. Apple controls every aspect of iOS - its mobile operating system - as well as the hardware. It pushes out new major new iOS versions yearly and update releases (the kind that fix bugs or security issues) on demand. As a result,nearly 80% of all iPhones are currently running iOS 10.Google also releases new versions of Android yearly, but largely relies on smartphone manufacturers and wireless carriers to approve and push updates. They have little incentive to do so, since lacking the latest Android features could be a reason to buy a new smartphone.With such a wildly varying assortment of smartphones, updates can often be problematic, leading to support issues. As a result, the latest version of Android is on just 2% of all Android smartphones, while themajority are running software released in 2014 or earlier.In other words, even if Googlehadaddressed most of the issues in Android Nougat as claimed, right now, there arehundreds of millions of Android devices that could still be affectedbecause they're running old software. Most iPhone users, however, should be okay, and the rest can be assured that Apple's consistent program of releases will address any outstanding issues.Apple has a similar approach with macOS. It updates its Mac computer operating system regularly and pushes out security updates as issues are discovered. With the smart home,Apple takes extreme security measures, including costly custom chips, factory inspections and end-to-end encryption between connected devices. This approach has meant slower adoption for its HomeKit platform, but with the benefit of being far more secure than the competition.As for smart TVs eavesdropping on you, that's just another reason to buy a relatively inexpensive streaming box - like an Apple TV - instead.The Age of Privacy Is OverMany people had been living with a probably naive expectation that everything they did with their smartphone was private and secure, especially when using encrypted apps. The latest WikiLeaks dump should end that notion and leave people watching their TV, PC and even smart thermostat with suspicion.Snap Inc. (SNAP) Aims to Win Where Disney (DIS) FailedBut by the time this plays out, it's also likely to make it clearer than ever before that some products are more secure than others, and some companies are in a better position to fix any vulnerabilities.Apple may have been named as one of the victims of CIA hacking, but it was quick to respond and quick to make it clear many of the WikiLeaks exploits have already been addressed. Perhaps more importantly, Apple's product strategy puts it in the position to be a leader in offering the most secure devices possible going forward.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceApple Inc.

Alphabet (GOOGL) Continues its Push into AI, Acquires Kaggle;3/9/2017;"Alphabet Inc.'sGOOGLGoogle announced the acquisition of Kaggle, an operator of data science and machine learning competition platform, at the Google Cloud Next conference in San Francisco.Founded in 2010, Kaggle's platform enables data scientists to conduct machine learning contests, host data sets and write and share codes. Over the years, Kaggle has become the world's largest data science community, leveraging on its early mover advantage and focusing on a niche market.Earlier this month, Google and Kaggle hosted a $100,000 machine learning competition around classifying YouTube videos.In recent times, Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning has helped Google in launching innovative products and services for multiple industries. Machine learning is also helping the company to overcome bigger challenges such as improving energy efficiency of data centers.We believe that continuous focus on innovation is likely to drive the Alphabet's stock price going ahead. The shares have appreciated 16.7% in the last one year compared with the ZacksInternet-Servicesindustry'sgain of 14.1%.Google Gearing Up Against Microsoft and AmazonWith more than 0.8 million data scientists on the platform, Kaggle opens up an opportunity for Google to broaden its reach within the data science community and be on an equal footing with Amazon'sAMZNAWS and Microsoft'sMSFTAzure that also offer data science services.As Alphabet generates significant cash from operations and also holds a huge cash balance, management has the flexibility to pursue growth in any area that exhibits true potential. It has the scale and resources to match up to its competitors.Buying Kaggle could also boost Google's recruiting efforts, giving it access to a large pool of scientists.Alphabet Inc. PE Ratio (TTM)Alphabet Inc. PE Ratio (TTM)|Alphabet Inc. QuoteKaggle Eyes Infrastructure, Scalability and Improved   ServicesAccording to Kaggle co-founder and chief executive Anthony Goldbloom, the acquisition will help Kaggle better serve its community with more powerful infrastructure, scalable training and deployment services and the capacity to store and query large data sets.The Kaggle team will join Google Cloud but operate as a distinct brand.To ConcludeGoogle's innovations outside the core search business include healthcare (partnership with Johnson & Johnson for the development of surgical robots), self-driving cars (partnership with Ford), cloud computing and drones, all being driven significantly by machine learning. We believe that the company has the financial muscle to overcome any short-term adverse conditions to continue pursuing these initiatives.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, Alphabet has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

AI Deep Dive: NVDA, IBM, CRM;3/9/2017;"makeZacksArticleAd();Last June I wrote a special report forZacks Confidentialcalled ""Big Economic Disruption: Big Data, AI, and Robotics.""While researching and talking about science-fiction technologies like machine learning and artificial intelligence is always fun, I began that report with a more important and sobering premise: why tens of millions of jobs globally were about to be eliminated in the next decade.This assertion came from research published in January of 2016 by Citi and the Oxford Martin School exploring the varying impact that automation would have on jobs and economies in major countries around the world.Here's what I wrote last June...Technology at Work v2.0: The Future Is Not What It Used to Be builds on 2013 research by Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael Osborne which found that 47 per cent of US jobs were at risk of automation over the next two decades.The 156-page report provides in-depth analysis of the vulnerabilities of countries and cities to job automation, explores what automation will mean for traditional models of economic growth, and considers how governments can prepare for the potentially disruptive impacts of job automation on society.Key areas of analysis in the new report include this startling projection right at the outset:Risks of job automation in emerging economies such as China and India are as high as 77% and 69% over the next two decades.That's a lot of emerging markets workers put out of work in a fairly short time.And it challenges what I had long believed: that China and India would make steady progress in their efforts to bring over 1 billion people collectively into the ranks of the global middle class.That assumption was based on the efficient ability and desire of corporations to move manufacturing and service jobs to those countries and thereby balance the global market for goods and labor with the most cost-efficient choices available.But the reality is that automation trends -- broadly defined as those involving cloud computing, business intelligence (Big Data analytics), artificial intelligence, and robotics -- will create far more disruption for capital and labor sources than most are imagining.It's not just about the select company going out of business because a new technology or software solution -- like 3-D ""printed"" parts -- just replaced what their 50 employees did for far less money. It's about entire industries getting turned inside-out. In short, the industrial revolutions of China and India could be over sooner than many would like.Here's how the Citi-Oxford report summed it up...""While manufacturing productivity has traditionally enabled developing countries to close the gap with richer countries, automation is likely to impact negatively on their ability to do this, and new growth models will be required.""The impact of automation may be more disruptive for developing countries, due to lower levels of consumer demand and limited social safety nets. With automation and developments in 3D printing likely to drive companies to move manufacturing closer to home, developing countries risk 'premature de-industrialisation'.""Digital industries have not created many new jobs. Since 2000, just 0.5% of the US workforce has shifted into new technology industries, most of which are directly associated with digital technologies.""This amount of disruption should not be taken lightly. Massive changes are coming to industry that will have deep impacts for economies and workers.I think every citizen should be studying these changes and impacts on an ongoing basis to find the best ways to position their career, their business, and their investments.(end of excerpt from my June Zacks Confidential report)That report ended, as all ZCs do, with actionable investment ideas.Tasked to answer the question ""How does one invest to capitalize on these megatrends?"" I came up with 4 stocks you had to own for the long term.Here's how I answered...So this brings me back to my top 4 picks for the future of work. And they will all be involved in robotics and additive manufacturing (3-D ""printing"") in some form, whether providing the software to design, build, and operate the machines, or the cloud-AI-machine learning data to drive their ""intelligence.""1)Microsoft (MSFT): I believe buying this stock near $50 virtually guarantees a chance to beat the market over the next 5-10 years. Stifel Nicolaus analysts recently met with Microsoft management to talk about cloud and BI initiatives. Here's what they said: ""The meetings served to reinforce our view the company's commercial cloud strategy is on track to hit the $20B FY18 goal and should be a source of solid growth for the next several years. Azure (the BigData platform) should also continue to close the gap with AWS as Microsoft expands its product offering and is able to exploit its existing customer relationships to create unique hybrid scenarios."" They maintain a $58 12-month price target on MSFT shares.2)Alphabet (GOOGL): One of the most innovative companies on the planet is also at the heart of Big Data analytics and automation. This is a stock that investors should view with a minimum 10-year horizon and dollar-cost average small buys between $600 and $800, while you still can. While the company will try and fail at many side ventures, ala the Skunk Works model they copied from Lockheed Martin innovators, Larry Page recently said his new metric for evaluating company projects is this: ""Are you working on something that will change the world? Yes or no?""3)Amazon (AMZN): Much like Page, Jeff Bezos has a vision of the future and find ways to be a part of it. It's no wonder both of them are involved in space rocketry too. But Bezos is more practical, ensuring steady sales. He is credited with once saying something to this effect: ""Everybody wants to focus on how the future will be different. We try to ask 'How will it be the same?' and then those are the businesses we want to be in.""4)IBM is relevant and affordable again near $150 (11X next year's $13.75 EPS). Their powerful Watson Cognitive Analytics platform is appealing to many industries at the enterprise level, from medical research and diagnostics to manufacturing and marketing predictive capabilities. And they did a beautiful thing by putting a ""human"" voice on Watson to attract the interest and fascination of young people everywhere in the power of data. It's their future after all.I recommended IBM shares in 2010 as the ""safe"" big cap Tech stock to outperform the market over 3 years and it did just that, rising from $125 to over $200 in 2013, with Warren Buffett joining the party at $175 as he finally found a Tech stock he could love. My buy then was based on their European contracts in the ""smart energy grid"" which I believed carried lower risk than most businesses since they were serving, and embedded in, the infrastructure of municipal power.IBM will find a way to ""embed"" Watson in the Business Intelligence and cognitive/predictive analytics of many corporations who will come to depend on their superior commitment to data science R&D. Hopefully, they can use Watson to redesign the IBM corporate strategy for lower costs and higher sales and remain relevant to investors for another 50 years.And here was their performance from June 6 up to the election, and since:MSFT: +16.3% to the election and +7.4% sinceGOOGL: +11.2% to the election and +5.2% sinceAMZN: +8.4% to the election and +7.96% sinceIBM: +1.6% to the election and +15.65% sinceS&P 500: +12% from June 6 to March 9,2017It's nice to see that you would have done nearly as well owning IBM as GOOGL or AMZN in this full period since June 6. And nothing has changed in my view about any of these stocks, although I would wait for pullbacks in all of them before initiating new positions. (I've had a bet since the beginning of the year with another investor about whether GOOGL or AMZN gets to $1,000 first. They've been trading neck-and-neck around $850 and my money is on the latter.)But I am adding 2 more stocks to the mix. And, beyond fascinating, both of them have partnered with IBM since my original thesis.The NVIDIA ConnectionI am going to try and tell you this important story without mentioning those fancy action games my son plays till all hours. I hearNVIDIA (NVDA)makes chips and graphics solutions that satisfy a gamer's ""need for speed"" (and parallel processing) too. But this story will be about the technology applied to more important tasks.In September, NVIDIA joined forces with IBM to launch a new type of server built for machine learning based on NVIDIA's GPU semiconductor solutions. This is not a new partnership as the companies had been working together for several years and you can get some background from this 2014 NVIDIA blog post...NVIDIA and IBM Bring Supercomputing to Big Data AnalyticsGPU-accelerated computing is the use of a graphics processing unit (GPU) together with a CPU to accelerate deep learning, analytics, and engineering applications. From the NVIDIA website, a crystal clear explanation...""A simple way to understand the difference between a GPU and a CPU is to compare how they process tasks. A CPU consists of a few cores optimized for sequential serial processing while a GPU has a massively parallel architecture consisting of thousands of smaller, more efficient cores designed for handling multiple tasks simultaneously.""Massively Parallel Architecture (MPA)Yeah, that's what is needed to do machine learning and anything close to artificial intelligence.In the early 1990's I read a book by physicist Heinz Pagels called The Dreams of Reason: The Computer and the Rise of the Sciences of Complexity. His understanding of how ""big data"" crunching would change both science and business was powerfully prescient nearly 30 years ago (published in 1988).As chip innovations shrunk computing power into ever smaller machines, amazing tasks suddenly became affordable to average researchers, technologists and nerds in general. Heinz wasn't predicting which companies would make money off of this trend. But he knew it would have large impacts on society, science, and commerce.It was in his book that I first learned about ""parallel processing"" that makes so much technology possible today. IBM has been playing with the ""massively"" component for a while, ala Deep Blue, the world's top chess computer. NVIDIA has taken it to new levels since 2007. Together, they are a force.Here was Ian Buck writing on the NVIDIA blog on September 8, 2016 about the new venture with IBM...Data center workloads are changing. Not long ago these systems were primarily used to handle storage and serve up web pages, but now they're increasingly tasked with AI workloads like understanding speech, text, images and video or analyzing big data for insights.Billions of consumers want instant answers to a multitude of questions, while enterprise companies want to analyze mountains of data to better serve their customers' needs. Where do those answers come from? Data centers.As a leader in server systems, IBM saw this trend coming several years ago, and partnered with us to accelerate new data center workloads. After four years of development, IBM today introduced its Power System S822LC for High Performance Computing powered by NVIDIA Tesla P100 GPUs and NVLink to facilitate high-performance analytics and enable deep learning on ever increasing mountains of data.The system couples two of IBM's POWER8 CPUs with four NVIDIA Tesla P100 GPUs connected via our NVLink high-speed interface. This is a custom-built GPU accelerator server, where the NVLink interface is routed on the motherboard and uses our Tesla P100 SXM2 GPU.This tight coupling of IBM and NVIDIA technology enables data to flow 5x faster than over PCIe, accelerating time to insight for many of today's most critical applications, like advanced analytics, deep learning and AI.""The user insights and the business value you can deliver with advanced analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence is increasingly gated by performance,"" says Doug Balog, general manager of IBM Power Systems. ""Accelerated computing that can really drive big data workloads will become foundational in the cognitive era. Based on OpenPOWER innovations from partners such as NVIDIA, our new OpenPOWER Linux servers with POWERAccel set a new standard for these workloads.""And the two companies followed-up this powerful coup against Intel's X86 line of core processors with this news release on November 14...IBM and NVIDIA Team Up on World's Fastest Deep Learning Enterprise SolutionMichael Feldman, writing for the Top500.org, summed up the news this way...""IT soul mates IBM and NVIDIA are at it again, this time collaborating on a deep learning (DL) toolkit, known as PowerAI, optimized for IBM's Power S822LC for High Performance Computing platform. The integration of the toolkit and the IBM hardware is being aimed at what NVIDIA and IBM believe to be a burgeoning market in enterprise AI.""GPU accelerators now powering energy-efficient data centers in government labs, universities, enterprises, and small-and-medium businesses around the world. They play a huge role in accelerating applications in platforms ranging from artificial intelligence to cars, drones, and robots.And the IBM-NVIDIA tag-team will be a powerful alliance in these computing markets.See? I did it. Got through that whole story without mentioning that questionable use of time (""video games"") at all. Except just there.The Salesforce ConnectionLast month, I wrote another Zacks Confidential about software. This one was titled ""The SaaSy Nature of the Global Economy."" My thesis was that software innovations were often the best indicators of trends in business because after the game-changing smartphone, the explosion of the app universe kept creating new categories of services and entirely new business models (Uber, Airbnb, Snapchat, etc) that required ever-further innovations in software.My top stock pick for that report wasSalesforce.com (CRM). Here's what I said...The $57 billion giant of customer engagement software is certainly not a takeover candidate -- but then who thought LinkedIn was either? In either case, CRM is still seen as the preeminent leader in the industry, both by Wall Street analysts and research firm Gartner.The stock is expensive on a P/E basis but I expect innovations in this space to come from CRM at the expense of the competition as they ""stack"" features and value for their corporate clients. The average price target on the Street is $93, while Goldman Sachs bumped theirs higher to $96 at the start of February.CRM reports on Tuesday 2/28 and I would buy this Zacks #2 Rank on any weakness in the $70s.I barely mentioned the company's latest innovation, Einstein, because I didn't fully understand it yet. It was only formally launched in late February.I also made a video where I briefly explained the high-level feud between CRM and MSFT, especially after LNKD:SaaSy B2B Sales Are in the Clouds.I bought CRM shares last week for the Zacks TAZR Trader service after another strong earnings report and guidance on February 28. Two years ago, CEO Marc Benioff was boasting about having become the fastest ""software"" company to $6 billion in revenue, and set on becoming the fastest to $10 billion.Given that 2016 closed with $8.4 billion -- 26% annual growth -- and they are guiding the current fiscal year to $10.2 billion (+21% annual growth), it seems they are on their way.During the company's October analyst day, Salesforce updated the size of its TAM (total addressable market) to about $70 billion in 2016 and projected a CAGR of 11 percent to reach $105 billion by 2020. They have plenty of potential to grab more of that market share.And while the valuation is a headwind for the stock -- trading at over 6X sales -- the premier position in enterprise CRM is undisputed. If anybody can grab more of that TAM, it's CRM.Embedded: Salesforce Knows What It Means TooFor the past few months, I've been studying the sales software space and marketing ""enablement"" space via several web-centric ""mini-CRMs"" like HubSpot (HUBS), Infusionsoft, Marketo, ReEnvision Inbound, and ActiveCampaign.These and other SaaS platforms are integrating and automating the functions of marketing and sales for small and medium-sized businesses like never before.While these young upstarts potentially threaten CRM -- and Microsoft leads a beachhead assault with their buy-out of LinkedIn -- salesforce.com remains the ""killer app"" for many corporations at the enterprise level.Part of the reason is, of course, that once you have a customer relationship management and engagement platform ""embedded"" in your corporation's economic infrastructure, it's hard to ""kick them out of bed.""But another aspect is that Marc Benioff is still playing to win -- especially after the MSFT-LNKD coup (see my videoSaaSy B2B Sales Are in the Cloudsfor the story there).And so he keeps innovating and endearing his embedded software to his blue-chip enterprise clients. Here was the latest headline from February as they formally rolled-out the live version of the project they beta-launched in October...Salesforce Introduces Service Cloud Einstein, the World's #1 Intelligent Customer Service PlatformBottom line: CRM remains top intel for ""salesforces"" everywhere.Einstein Asks Watson for HelpThen, this week on March 6 came this announcement of a partnership...IBM and Salesforce today announced a global strategic partnership to deliver joint solutions designed to leverage artificial intelligence and enable companies to make smarter decisions, faster than ever before. With the partnership, IBM Watson, the leading AI platform for business, and Salesforce Einstein, AI that powers the world's #1 CRM, will seamlessly connect to enable an entirely new level of intelligent customer engagement across sales, service, marketing, commerce and more. IBM is also strategically investing in its Global Business Services capabilities for Salesforce with a new practice to help clients rapidly deploy the combined IBM Watson and Salesforce Einstein capabilities.The partnership will bring new insights from Watson directly into the Salesforce Intelligent Customer Success Platform, combining deep customer insights from Salesforce Einstein with Watson's structured and unstructured data across many sources and industries including weather, healthcare, financial services and retail. Together, Watson and Einstein will ingest, reason over and derive recommendations to accelerate decision making and drive greater customer success.In addition, IBM put a wolf on the prowl...""Bluewolf Dedicated Consulting Services and Expertise for Cognitive Solutions, Adding to IBM Strategic Services for Salesforce: Bluewolf, an IBM company, has formed a new practice to help clients rapidly deploy the combined IBM Watson and Salesforce Einstein capabilities. This new unit capitalizes on Bluewolf's over fifteen years of Salesforce implementations and their current portfolio of multiple Salesforce and Watson projects. Bluewolf will also develop new industry-specific accelerators used by enterprise clients to accelerate adoption of cognitive applications.""Never Underestimate Deep BlueThe brand that is IBM stands for persistent technological innovation and brain power. Under Ginni Rometty's leadership, the old mainframe maker continues to reinvent.And we haven't even talked about how they make cloud technologies accessible to companies outside the Fortune 1,000 with Bluemix, an app design and development platform.Coincidentally, IBM just held their Investor Briefing this week and analysts came away mostly positive on the transition from legacy products and services to higher-margin growth areas in Watson strategic initiatives.Wells Fargo raised their valuation range on shares to $175-$185 from $160-$170.RecommendationsI would accumulate these stocks in these ranges:NVDA: $85 to $95(despite the rich valuation at 32X forward estimates, my call is that we'll see new highs of ""$125 Before $75"")CRM: $77 to $82(Morgan Stanley raised their PT to $107, Wedbush to $102, and Cowen & Co. and Stifel both to $100)IBM: $165 to $175(this stock won't run away from you; it simply makes big swings that are fairly predictable)Disclosure: I own NVDA and CRM for the Zacks TAZR Trader service.Now See Our Private Investment IdeasWhile the above ideas are being shared with the public, other trades are hidden from everyone but selected members.

Stocks to Buy: 3 Tech Stocks Paying Nice Dividends;3/9/2017;"Many of the bestdividend   stocksare found in sectors where the rate of change and disruption is   slow -- sectors like consumer staples, utilities, and banks. But   there are some excellent dividend stocks in the tech sector, too.Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) ,IBM(NYSE: IBM) , andMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) , for instance, all pay solid, growing   dividends.Here's a look at why each of these tech giants represents a   good bet for investors looking for income.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();Apple: dividend upsideApple offers the smallest dividend yield -- 1.6% -- of these   three stocks. But investors shouldn't overlook its   attractiveness. Apple's dividend easily makes up what it lacks in   yield with growth potential.Currently, Apple is paying out just 27% of its earnings,   leaving significant upside for dividend increases in the future.   Further, management has demonstrated how it's prioritizing   dividend growth since the company initiated its dividend in 2012.   Adjusted for a 7-to-1 stock split in 2014, Apple's dividend has   increased 50% since 2012.Apple's annual dividend increases have steadily remained at   about 10% -- a rate the company looks like it could sustain for   years to come.IBM: an above-average yieldWith a dividend yield of about 3.1%, IBM has the fattest   per-share payout of these three stocks. Even more, while IBM's   44% payout ratio -- the percentage of annual earnings it is   paying out in dividends -- is well above Apple's 27% payout   ratio, it's still low enough for investors to expect meaningful   dividend growth for years to come.Indeed, IBM's dividend has grown at a very healthy average   annualized rate of about 14% during the past five years. However,   the company's most recent dividend increase wasn't as substantial   as in past years. In 2016, IBM's dividend increased 7.7%, down   from an 18.2% hike in 2015, as the company'songoing transformationhas put pressure on net income.Despite the slowdown in IBM's dividend increases, the   company's 21 consecutive years of dividend increases, along with   its low payout ratio, set a solid precedent for ongoing dividend   increases over the long haul.Microsoft: enduring cash flow from a profitable business   modelMicrosoft's ability to generate heady levels of cash flow from   its profitable business model is undeniable. For the past 10   years, Microsoft's gross profit margin, or gross profit as a   percentage of revenue, has been between about 61% and 81%. Sure,   the software giant's gross profit margin is on the low end of   this range today -- at 61%. But the inherent profitability of   Microsoft's software-focused business, combined with the   stickiness of its Office suite and its enterprise applications   and services, means it can count on enduring cash flow for years   to come, to continue feeding investors solid dividends.Image source: Getty Images.With a 2.4% dividend yield, Microsoft offers investors a   better dividend yield than Apple, but it's still well behind   IBM's 3.1% dividend yield. While Microsoft's payout ratio of   69.5% is higher than IBM's, Microsoft's dividend as a percentage   of free cash flow -- at 42% -- better captures the software   giant's room for dividend increases. Recent one-time charges   against earnings and restructuring charges have suppressed net   income and pushed the company's payout ratio higher. By   comparison, Apple and IBM are paying out 23% and 41% of their   free cash flow in dividends.Microsoft's most recent annual increase was 8% -- and the   company's financials look set to support similar increases over   time.In general, income investors may not find many great dividend   stocks in tech. But these three stocks are just as worthy of a   spot in an income portfolio as go-to Dividend Aristocrats in   consumer staples, utilities, and banking.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

9 Blue-Chip Stocks This Top Money Manager Likes;3/9/2017;"Many investors began to drool over the energy and financial   sectors after the November elections. The prospect of lower   corporate tax rates and less restrictive regulatory yokes was a   big reason. But Larry Puglia, manager of $34.2 billion T.   Rowe Price Blue Chip Growth Fund (TRBCX), began to place a lot of new bets on the technology sector.That's despite the fact that the tech sector stands to benefit   less from changes in corporate taxes. Many tech companies already   have less-than-peak rates, Puglia says. In addition, tech   industry leaders worry that President Trump's immigration   policies could deprive them of skilled workers. Also, investors   feared there was friction between President Trump andAmazon(AMZN) CEO Jeff Bezos, who also owns the Washington Post, over the   newspaper's campaign coverage.But Puglia feels the benefit to corporations - including many   tech companies - of repatriation of bank accounts stuffed   with cash has been overlooked somewhat. And Puglia thinks the   likelihood of antagonism between the tech sector and the White   House is overblown. ""We do not think that would happen to a great   degree,"" Puglia said.makeArticleAd();Puglia's warm outlook for tech is reflected in   the fund's most recently disclosed top-10 additions in the   past six months. They included not only banking giantJPMorgan Chase(JPM), but also techiesMicrosoft(MSFT),NXP Semiconductors(NXPI),Alibaba Group(BABA),PayPal Holdings(PYPL),Priceline(PCLN) andFacebook(FB).Fast-food restaurant operatorYum Brands(YUM) was another top-10 addition. And the fund began a new   position in brokerageCharles Schwab(SCHW) that was large enough to also enter its top 10.IBD'S TAKE:As the Trump agenda continues to steer the stock market,     readIBD LeaderboardandThe Big Pictureevery day to find highly rated stocks and sectors     poised to move higher.Puglia's moves are worth watching. Going into Thursday, his   fund's 14.64% average annual gain over the prior five years   outperformed 94% of its large-cap growth rivals tracked by   Morningstar Inc. The S&P 500's 14.00% pace also trailed. He's   in the top 84% year to date, which marks a rebound from 2016's   modest 0.98% gain.Progress Of Puglia's PortfolioJPMorgan shot higher shortly before Election Day. After four   quarters of declining earnings per share, EPS grew 1%, 20% and   20% in the past three stanzas. Like other banks, JPMorgan   benefits from investors' expectations that this corner of   financial services will face a lighter regulatory burden than it   would have under a Democratic-held White House or Congress. In   addition, banks are expected to carve out wider net margins as   interest rates increase. They are not expected to raise interest   paid to depositors by much if any, yet they will be able to   charge more for loans.Microsoft is well-positioned to keep on generating strong   growth in its Office 365 suite of products, Puglia says. He   also likes the outlook for its corporate cloud operations and   Azure, its public cloud-computing platform.Chipmaker NXP is a leading provider of semiconductor solutions   used in automotive connectivity and infotainment, he says. NXP's   chips are also used in smartphone near-field communications   payment applications. On Tuesday,Qualcomm(QCOM) extended its takeover bid for NXP until April 4.Alibaba offers consumer-to-consumer e-commerce services   through its Taobao business and it runs T-Mall, a   business-to-consumer platform. Both have dominant market share,   Puglia says. Alibaba is also a leader in cloud processing   services. The Chinese government is a key customer. Trading   around 103 as of early Thursday, shares are below a 104.67   cup-with-handle entry.Money-transfer services provider PayPal has a five-year   earnings annual growth rate of 25%. And it has reached deals withMastercard(MA) andVisa(V) that are mutually beneficial, Puglia says. Many investors had   feared a more adversarial competition among the three companies.   And Puglia likes PayPal's Venmo, Braintree and One Touch   services.Trading around 43, shares are still trading just under a 43.17   buy point of a cup-with-handle base. EPS grew 9%, 13% and 17% in   the past three quarters.Priceline gapped up nearly 6% on Feb. 28, a day after   reporting a 32% increase in fourth-quarter EPS. Its top line grew   17% to $2.34 billion. Both earnings and revenue topped the   company's own guidance. Hotel bookings have been the stock's   largest growth driver. Airline ticket sales fell. That's despite   steadily lowoil   prices, which have helped keep airfares down. The company's EPS grew   12%, 23% and 32% the past three quarters.Facebook sharesare up 20% this year. Investors have begun to appreciate how   well the company's advertising products, video strategy and   Instagram photo sharing are being received, Puglia   says. He adds that its investment in WhatsApp and Messenger   also provides solid positioning in the messaging market,   which is growing in popularity. ""We especially like the   company's efforts to promote the use of video on its   platform and to better monetize Instagram and video,"" he   said.Facebook reportedly made the launch of its Facebook Live video   service a priority last year. But enough users have posted videos   of violence and crime to make at least some advertisers wary of   the platform, according to CNBC.com. Facebook also has been hit   with measurement controversies.Yum shares rose 9% this year through Feb. 13 to a 52-week   high, but they've pulled back 7% since then. That has left   them a scant 3% above where they were when Yum spun off its   China division last Oct. 31. After EPS grew 44% for three   quarters in a row, EPS grew 18% in Q4.Schwab has done a nice job of growing customer assets under   management, Puglia wrote. ""Its earnings should benefit   substantially from rising interest rates,"" Puglia added. ""This is   enhanced by the fact that Schwab has a significant   bank embedded within the company. That enables it to sweep   brokerage deposits into the bank, creating more net interest   income.""Rain fell on Schwab's parade recently when it got caught up in   apricing warwith Fidelity Investments and TDAmeritrade(AMTD) over brokerage commissions. But Puglia says Schwab is far   less dependent on commissions thanTD Ameritradeis.RELATED:12 Blue-Chip Beauties That This Top Money     Manager Likes NowDoes Your Mutual Fund Manager Have Skin In The     Game?

Cavium Inc.'s Thunder X2 Aims for Microsoft Corporation's Cloud;3/9/2017;"Data center chipmakerCavium(NASDAQ: CAVM) announced on March 8 that it is ""collaborating   withMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) on evaluating and enabling a variety of cloud   workloads running on [its] flagship Thunder X2 ARMv8-A Data   Center processor for the Microsoft Azure cloud platform.""The announcement goes on to say that Cavium and Microsoft are   ""demonstrating web services on a version of Windows Server   developed for Microsoft's internal use running cloud services   workloads on Thunder X2.""Image source: Intel.makeArticleAd();This announcement is similar to one that fellow ARM-based   server processor makerQualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM)made at the same time.Let's take a closer look at what this announcement means for   Cavium in the near term and potentially over the long term.Near term? Probably not muchThe wording of Cavium's press release appears carefully   constructed to avoid giving the impression that Microsoft is   planning to buy and deploy a bunch of Cavium's Thunder X2 chips   in its data centers anytime soon.Indeed, the phrases ""evaluating and enabling"" as well as the   word ""demonstrating"" seem aways away from ""planning to deploy in   significant quantities.""So, in the near term, I don't expect the joint work that   Microsoft and Cavium are doing to lead to significant revenue for   Cavium anytime soon. The work that these two companies are doing   is much more likely to lay the groundwork for Microsoft to be   able to deploy potential successors to the Thunder X2 -- should   those products meet Microsoft's needs for certain workloads.Taking a longer-term viewAt this point, it's starting to look as though Cavium and   Qualcomm are the only two merchant ARM-based server processor   vendors left in in the game (there are companies building chips   for their own internal use like Huawei, for example).Cavium's edge appears to be its heritage is as a data   center/networking processor vendor (Qualcomm hails from a mobile   processor background), but Qualcomm has significantly greater   financial resources to try to slug it out with market incumbentIntel(NASDAQ: INTC) .It's likely not going to be easy for either company to wrest   away significant market share from Intel to begin with (which   invests more in data center-specific technologies and marketing   than either Qualcomm or Cavium -- probably more than both   combined), and that difficulty is compounded by the fact that   Cavium and Qualcomm must compete against each other, too.Success for ARM server chip vendors like Qualcomm and Cavium   is, in general, not something that's guaranteed to come at all,   and if it does come, it'll be hard won over multiple years after   substantial investments in research and development,   software/ecosystem enablement, and marketing efforts.It's worth noting that on Cavium's most recent earnings call,   CEO Syed Ali said that the company ""expect[s] to release [its]   next generation products"" in 2017. Given that the company had   previously said that it would begin sampling Thunder X2 in the   beginning of 2017, I'd expect shipments for revenue to occur late   in the year.What investors need to keep an eye on, then, is what kind of   revenue ramp Cavium ultimately begins to experience with Thunder   X2 and the impact it starts having on the company's financials,   independent of this announcement from Microsoft.10 stocks we like better than Cavium NetworksWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Can You Beat the S&P 500 at Its Own Game?;3/9/2017;"The S&P 500 isthebenchmark for most investors.The important stock index consists of 500 of the largest companies that are listed on the NYSE or the Nasdaq, and securities are weighted in the benchmark by market capitalization levels. Currently, top stocks in the benchmark include Apple (AAPL) at about 3.6% of the total, Microsoft (MSFT) at 2.5% of the total, and Exxon Mobil (XOM) at 1.65%.But while this approach is a great barometer for market health, is it the best way for investors to put their money to work? Investors have numerous options in this department, including products likeSPY,VOO, orIVV, as these simply follow the benchmark exactly as laid-out by the index creators. But is there a potentially better way?Enter Equal WeightIn this edition ofthe Dutram Report, I look for an alternate approach in a talk with Michael Willis, the lead portfolio manager of INDEX Funds. His key product, the Index Funds S&P 500 Equal Weight (INDEX), takes the same S&P 500 stocks, but invests in them equally.This means that instead of Apple accounting for nearly 4% of the total, or Microsoft making up 2.5% of the fund, each account for roughly 0.2% of the total, at least at rebalancing dates. And not just the mega caps, but each and every stock comes with this same weight, giving the fund an equal interest in giants like Exxon, and the smallest S&P 500 components alike.While this might sound like a small difference, we go over in the podcast how this actually ends up being something very important to overall returns. Michael discusses how nearly half of the S&P 500 (market cap weighted) is tied up in about 50 companies, and that the remaining 450 have to fight over the remainder. He argues that the equal weight is a much more balanced way to achieve exposure, while thefund's fact sheetshows that this approach has outperformed the market over long time periods.We also talk about the pros and cons of this approach, such as its potentially heavier weighting in mid-cap securities and what this means for investors, as well as some important fund specifics. This includes information regarding the cost and minimum investment, and also the reason for selecting a fund structure. We then go over the ways that INDEX differs from the ETF counterpart out there, the Guggenheim S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (RSP), looking beyond the lower cost of INDEX when compared to the Guggenheim fund.Bottom LineEqual weight investing is an overlooked strategy for targeting stocks, but it is clearly one that can lead to outperformance over long time periods. If you are curious about this approach, check out this podcast for everything you need to know about how it works, and if this can help improve returns for long-term investors.So, make sure to listen to this edition ofthe Dutram Reportfor a closer look at equal weight investing, and what the pros and cons of this approach are for those seeking a different way to play the S&P 500.

Apple Inc. Should Thank WikiLeaks for Its CIA Reveal;3/9/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOn Tuesday, WikiLeaks released ""Vault 7,"" a huge collection of documents that reveal hacking tools used by the CIA. While the dump paints the CIA in an unflattering light, the fallout may well be worse for some of the world's largest tech companies, includingApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL).makeArticleAd();Source: AppleSpecifically, the CIA has a long list of iOS exploits it has used to gain access to iPhones. Despite being named along with numerous other giants of tech, the latest WikiLeaks dump actually highlights a key advantage for Apple in particular.And while its aura of security may emerge tarnished, the iPhone may actually come out ahead over the long term thanks to WikiLeaks.What Was in WikiLeaks Vault 7?The latestWikiLeaks dump involves 8,761 documentsoutlining a wide range of CIA hacking tools, including viruses, malware, zero-day exploits, trojans and remote control systems.In addition there are 14 iOS exploits listed, several dozen Android vulnerabilities and methods for accessing encrypted chats (essentially reading the contentsbeforethey are encrypted by gaining access to the host device).9 Stocks to Buy That Are Growing Faster Than AmazonIt's not all smartphones, either. The CIA has developedmalware to infect computersrunning macOS, Windows and Linux. It's even capable of turning Samsung Smart TVs on their owners, using them as listening devices to record conversations.This Doesn't Look Good for AppleApple has long positioned itself as a privacy advocate. It has always played up the security of the iPhone and evenrefused an FBI request to unlock the iPhoneused by a shooter in 2015's San Bernardino terrorist attack.Apple CEO Tim Cook released a written statement at the time, saying:""… the U.S. government has asked us for something we simply do not have, and something we consider too dangerous to create. They have asked us to build a backdoor to the iPhone.""The WikiLeaks Vault 7 release made it clear that iOS wasn't as secure as Apple had thought.How Apple Could Come Out AheadWikiLeaks is bad news for Apple in the short term. But the reveal of CIA hacking of mobile devices and consumer electronics could actually be good news for the company in the long run. Apple quickly went on record as saying many of the vulnerabilities identified in the WikiLeaks Vault 7 documentswere already addressed with iOS 10. And it is working to identify and patch any new issues.Apple and Google chose very different strategies when it comes to smartphones. Apple controls every aspect of iOS - its mobile operating system - as well as the hardware. It pushes out new major new iOS versions yearly and update releases (the kind that fix bugs or security issues) on demand. As a result,nearly 80% of all iPhones are currently running iOS 10.Google also releases new versions of Android yearly, but largely relies on smartphone manufacturers and wireless carriers to approve and push updates. They have little incentive to do so, since lacking the latest Android features could be a reason to buy a new smartphone.With such a wildly varying assortment of smartphones, updates can often be problematic, leading to support issues. As a result, the latest version of Android is on just 2% of all Android smartphones, while themajority are running software released in 2014 or earlier.In other words, even if Googlehadaddressed most of the issues in Android Nougat as claimed, right now, there arehundreds of millions of Android devices that could still be affectedbecause they're running old software. Most iPhone users, however, should be okay, and the rest can be assured that Apple's consistent program of releases will address any outstanding issues.Apple has a similar approach with macOS. It updates its Mac computer operating system regularly and pushes out security updates as issues are discovered. With the smart home,Apple takes extreme security measures, including costly custom chips, factory inspections and end-to-end encryption between connected devices. This approach has meant slower adoption for its HomeKit platform, but with the benefit of being far more secure than the competition.As for smart TVs eavesdropping on you, that's just another reason to buy a relatively inexpensive streaming box - like an Apple TV - instead.The Age of Privacy Is OverMany people had been living with a probably naive expectation that everything they did with their smartphone was private and secure, especially when using encrypted apps. The latest WikiLeaks dump should end that notion and leave people watching their TV, PC and even smart thermostat with suspicion.Snap Inc. (SNAP) Aims to Win Where Disney (DIS) FailedBut by the time this plays out, it's also likely to make it clearer than ever before that some products are more secure than others, and some companies are in a better position to fix any vulnerabilities.Apple may have been named as one of the victims of CIA hacking, but it was quick to respond and quick to make it clear many of the WikiLeaks exploits have already been addressed. Perhaps more importantly, Apple's product strategy puts it in the position to be a leader in offering the most secure devices possible going forward.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceApple Inc.

Alphabet (GOOGL) Continues its Push into AI, Acquires Kaggle;3/9/2017;"Alphabet Inc.'sGOOGLGoogle announced the acquisition of Kaggle, an operator of data science and machine learning competition platform, at the Google Cloud Next conference in San Francisco.Founded in 2010, Kaggle's platform enables data scientists to conduct machine learning contests, host data sets and write and share codes. Over the years, Kaggle has become the world's largest data science community, leveraging on its early mover advantage and focusing on a niche market.Earlier this month, Google and Kaggle hosted a $100,000 machine learning competition around classifying YouTube videos.In recent times, Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning has helped Google in launching innovative products and services for multiple industries. Machine learning is also helping the company to overcome bigger challenges such as improving energy efficiency of data centers.We believe that continuous focus on innovation is likely to drive the Alphabet's stock price going ahead. The shares have appreciated 16.7% in the last one year compared with the ZacksInternet-Servicesindustry'sgain of 14.1%.Google Gearing Up Against Microsoft and AmazonWith more than 0.8 million data scientists on the platform, Kaggle opens up an opportunity for Google to broaden its reach within the data science community and be on an equal footing with Amazon'sAMZNAWS and Microsoft'sMSFTAzure that also offer data science services.As Alphabet generates significant cash from operations and also holds a huge cash balance, management has the flexibility to pursue growth in any area that exhibits true potential. It has the scale and resources to match up to its competitors.Buying Kaggle could also boost Google's recruiting efforts, giving it access to a large pool of scientists.Alphabet Inc. PE Ratio (TTM)Alphabet Inc. PE Ratio (TTM)|Alphabet Inc. QuoteKaggle Eyes Infrastructure, Scalability and Improved   ServicesAccording to Kaggle co-founder and chief executive Anthony Goldbloom, the acquisition will help Kaggle better serve its community with more powerful infrastructure, scalable training and deployment services and the capacity to store and query large data sets.The Kaggle team will join Google Cloud but operate as a distinct brand.To ConcludeGoogle's innovations outside the core search business include healthcare (partnership with Johnson & Johnson for the development of surgical robots), self-driving cars (partnership with Ford), cloud computing and drones, all being driven significantly by machine learning. We believe that the company has the financial muscle to overcome any short-term adverse conditions to continue pursuing these initiatives.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, Alphabet has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

AI Deep Dive: NVDA, IBM, CRM;3/9/2017;"makeZacksArticleAd();Last June I wrote a special report forZacks Confidentialcalled ""Big Economic Disruption: Big Data, AI, and Robotics.""While researching and talking about science-fiction technologies like machine learning and artificial intelligence is always fun, I began that report with a more important and sobering premise: why tens of millions of jobs globally were about to be eliminated in the next decade.This assertion came from research published in January of 2016 by Citi and the Oxford Martin School exploring the varying impact that automation would have on jobs and economies in major countries around the world.Here's what I wrote last June...Technology at Work v2.0: The Future Is Not What It Used to Be builds on 2013 research by Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael Osborne which found that 47 per cent of US jobs were at risk of automation over the next two decades.The 156-page report provides in-depth analysis of the vulnerabilities of countries and cities to job automation, explores what automation will mean for traditional models of economic growth, and considers how governments can prepare for the potentially disruptive impacts of job automation on society.Key areas of analysis in the new report include this startling projection right at the outset:Risks of job automation in emerging economies such as China and India are as high as 77% and 69% over the next two decades.That's a lot of emerging markets workers put out of work in a fairly short time.And it challenges what I had long believed: that China and India would make steady progress in their efforts to bring over 1 billion people collectively into the ranks of the global middle class.That assumption was based on the efficient ability and desire of corporations to move manufacturing and service jobs to those countries and thereby balance the global market for goods and labor with the most cost-efficient choices available.But the reality is that automation trends -- broadly defined as those involving cloud computing, business intelligence (Big Data analytics), artificial intelligence, and robotics -- will create far more disruption for capital and labor sources than most are imagining.It's not just about the select company going out of business because a new technology or software solution -- like 3-D ""printed"" parts -- just replaced what their 50 employees did for far less money. It's about entire industries getting turned inside-out. In short, the industrial revolutions of China and India could be over sooner than many would like.Here's how the Citi-Oxford report summed it up...""While manufacturing productivity has traditionally enabled developing countries to close the gap with richer countries, automation is likely to impact negatively on their ability to do this, and new growth models will be required.""The impact of automation may be more disruptive for developing countries, due to lower levels of consumer demand and limited social safety nets. With automation and developments in 3D printing likely to drive companies to move manufacturing closer to home, developing countries risk 'premature de-industrialisation'.""Digital industries have not created many new jobs. Since 2000, just 0.5% of the US workforce has shifted into new technology industries, most of which are directly associated with digital technologies.""This amount of disruption should not be taken lightly. Massive changes are coming to industry that will have deep impacts for economies and workers.I think every citizen should be studying these changes and impacts on an ongoing basis to find the best ways to position their career, their business, and their investments.(end of excerpt from my June Zacks Confidential report)That report ended, as all ZCs do, with actionable investment ideas.Tasked to answer the question ""How does one invest to capitalize on these megatrends?"" I came up with 4 stocks you had to own for the long term.Here's how I answered...So this brings me back to my top 4 picks for the future of work. And they will all be involved in robotics and additive manufacturing (3-D ""printing"") in some form, whether providing the software to design, build, and operate the machines, or the cloud-AI-machine learning data to drive their ""intelligence.""1)Microsoft (MSFT): I believe buying this stock near $50 virtually guarantees a chance to beat the market over the next 5-10 years. Stifel Nicolaus analysts recently met with Microsoft management to talk about cloud and BI initiatives. Here's what they said: ""The meetings served to reinforce our view the company's commercial cloud strategy is on track to hit the $20B FY18 goal and should be a source of solid growth for the next several years. Azure (the BigData platform) should also continue to close the gap with AWS as Microsoft expands its product offering and is able to exploit its existing customer relationships to create unique hybrid scenarios."" They maintain a $58 12-month price target on MSFT shares.2)Alphabet (GOOGL): One of the most innovative companies on the planet is also at the heart of Big Data analytics and automation. This is a stock that investors should view with a minimum 10-year horizon and dollar-cost average small buys between $600 and $800, while you still can. While the company will try and fail at many side ventures, ala the Skunk Works model they copied from Lockheed Martin innovators, Larry Page recently said his new metric for evaluating company projects is this: ""Are you working on something that will change the world? Yes or no?""3)Amazon (AMZN): Much like Page, Jeff Bezos has a vision of the future and find ways to be a part of it. It's no wonder both of them are involved in space rocketry too. But Bezos is more practical, ensuring steady sales. He is credited with once saying something to this effect: ""Everybody wants to focus on how the future will be different. We try to ask 'How will it be the same?' and then those are the businesses we want to be in.""4)IBM is relevant and affordable again near $150 (11X next year's $13.75 EPS). Their powerful Watson Cognitive Analytics platform is appealing to many industries at the enterprise level, from medical research and diagnostics to manufacturing and marketing predictive capabilities. And they did a beautiful thing by putting a ""human"" voice on Watson to attract the interest and fascination of young people everywhere in the power of data. It's their future after all.I recommended IBM shares in 2010 as the ""safe"" big cap Tech stock to outperform the market over 3 years and it did just that, rising from $125 to over $200 in 2013, with Warren Buffett joining the party at $175 as he finally found a Tech stock he could love. My buy then was based on their European contracts in the ""smart energy grid"" which I believed carried lower risk than most businesses since they were serving, and embedded in, the infrastructure of municipal power.IBM will find a way to ""embed"" Watson in the Business Intelligence and cognitive/predictive analytics of many corporations who will come to depend on their superior commitment to data science R&D. Hopefully, they can use Watson to redesign the IBM corporate strategy for lower costs and higher sales and remain relevant to investors for another 50 years.And here was their performance from June 6 up to the election, and since:MSFT: +16.3% to the election and +7.4% sinceGOOGL: +11.2% to the election and +5.2% sinceAMZN: +8.4% to the election and +7.96% sinceIBM: +1.6% to the election and +15.65% sinceS&P 500: +12% from June 6 to March 9,2017It's nice to see that you would have done nearly as well owning IBM as GOOGL or AMZN in this full period since June 6. And nothing has changed in my view about any of these stocks, although I would wait for pullbacks in all of them before initiating new positions. (I've had a bet since the beginning of the year with another investor about whether GOOGL or AMZN gets to $1,000 first. They've been trading neck-and-neck around $850 and my money is on the latter.)But I am adding 2 more stocks to the mix. And, beyond fascinating, both of them have partnered with IBM since my original thesis.The NVIDIA ConnectionI am going to try and tell you this important story without mentioning those fancy action games my son plays till all hours. I hearNVIDIA (NVDA)makes chips and graphics solutions that satisfy a gamer's ""need for speed"" (and parallel processing) too. But this story will be about the technology applied to more important tasks.In September, NVIDIA joined forces with IBM to launch a new type of server built for machine learning based on NVIDIA's GPU semiconductor solutions. This is not a new partnership as the companies had been working together for several years and you can get some background from this 2014 NVIDIA blog post...NVIDIA and IBM Bring Supercomputing to Big Data AnalyticsGPU-accelerated computing is the use of a graphics processing unit (GPU) together with a CPU to accelerate deep learning, analytics, and engineering applications. From the NVIDIA website, a crystal clear explanation...""A simple way to understand the difference between a GPU and a CPU is to compare how they process tasks. A CPU consists of a few cores optimized for sequential serial processing while a GPU has a massively parallel architecture consisting of thousands of smaller, more efficient cores designed for handling multiple tasks simultaneously.""Massively Parallel Architecture (MPA)Yeah, that's what is needed to do machine learning and anything close to artificial intelligence.In the early 1990's I read a book by physicist Heinz Pagels called The Dreams of Reason: The Computer and the Rise of the Sciences of Complexity. His understanding of how ""big data"" crunching would change both science and business was powerfully prescient nearly 30 years ago (published in 1988).As chip innovations shrunk computing power into ever smaller machines, amazing tasks suddenly became affordable to average researchers, technologists and nerds in general. Heinz wasn't predicting which companies would make money off of this trend. But he knew it would have large impacts on society, science, and commerce.It was in his book that I first learned about ""parallel processing"" that makes so much technology possible today. IBM has been playing with the ""massively"" component for a while, ala Deep Blue, the world's top chess computer. NVIDIA has taken it to new levels since 2007. Together, they are a force.Here was Ian Buck writing on the NVIDIA blog on September 8, 2016 about the new venture with IBM...Data center workloads are changing. Not long ago these systems were primarily used to handle storage and serve up web pages, but now they're increasingly tasked with AI workloads like understanding speech, text, images and video or analyzing big data for insights.Billions of consumers want instant answers to a multitude of questions, while enterprise companies want to analyze mountains of data to better serve their customers' needs. Where do those answers come from? Data centers.As a leader in server systems, IBM saw this trend coming several years ago, and partnered with us to accelerate new data center workloads. After four years of development, IBM today introduced its Power System S822LC for High Performance Computing powered by NVIDIA Tesla P100 GPUs and NVLink to facilitate high-performance analytics and enable deep learning on ever increasing mountains of data.The system couples two of IBM's POWER8 CPUs with four NVIDIA Tesla P100 GPUs connected via our NVLink high-speed interface. This is a custom-built GPU accelerator server, where the NVLink interface is routed on the motherboard and uses our Tesla P100 SXM2 GPU.This tight coupling of IBM and NVIDIA technology enables data to flow 5x faster than over PCIe, accelerating time to insight for many of today's most critical applications, like advanced analytics, deep learning and AI.""The user insights and the business value you can deliver with advanced analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence is increasingly gated by performance,"" says Doug Balog, general manager of IBM Power Systems. ""Accelerated computing that can really drive big data workloads will become foundational in the cognitive era. Based on OpenPOWER innovations from partners such as NVIDIA, our new OpenPOWER Linux servers with POWERAccel set a new standard for these workloads.""And the two companies followed-up this powerful coup against Intel's X86 line of core processors with this news release on November 14...IBM and NVIDIA Team Up on World's Fastest Deep Learning Enterprise SolutionMichael Feldman, writing for the Top500.org, summed up the news this way...""IT soul mates IBM and NVIDIA are at it again, this time collaborating on a deep learning (DL) toolkit, known as PowerAI, optimized for IBM's Power S822LC for High Performance Computing platform. The integration of the toolkit and the IBM hardware is being aimed at what NVIDIA and IBM believe to be a burgeoning market in enterprise AI.""GPU accelerators now powering energy-efficient data centers in government labs, universities, enterprises, and small-and-medium businesses around the world. They play a huge role in accelerating applications in platforms ranging from artificial intelligence to cars, drones, and robots.And the IBM-NVIDIA tag-team will be a powerful alliance in these computing markets.See? I did it. Got through that whole story without mentioning that questionable use of time (""video games"") at all. Except just there.The Salesforce ConnectionLast month, I wrote another Zacks Confidential about software. This one was titled ""The SaaSy Nature of the Global Economy."" My thesis was that software innovations were often the best indicators of trends in business because after the game-changing smartphone, the explosion of the app universe kept creating new categories of services and entirely new business models (Uber, Airbnb, Snapchat, etc) that required ever-further innovations in software.My top stock pick for that report wasSalesforce.com (CRM). Here's what I said...The $57 billion giant of customer engagement software is certainly not a takeover candidate -- but then who thought LinkedIn was either? In either case, CRM is still seen as the preeminent leader in the industry, both by Wall Street analysts and research firm Gartner.The stock is expensive on a P/E basis but I expect innovations in this space to come from CRM at the expense of the competition as they ""stack"" features and value for their corporate clients. The average price target on the Street is $93, while Goldman Sachs bumped theirs higher to $96 at the start of February.CRM reports on Tuesday 2/28 and I would buy this Zacks #2 Rank on any weakness in the $70s.I barely mentioned the company's latest innovation, Einstein, because I didn't fully understand it yet. It was only formally launched in late February.I also made a video where I briefly explained the high-level feud between CRM and MSFT, especially after LNKD:SaaSy B2B Sales Are in the Clouds.I bought CRM shares last week for the Zacks TAZR Trader service after another strong earnings report and guidance on February 28. Two years ago, CEO Marc Benioff was boasting about having become the fastest ""software"" company to $6 billion in revenue, and set on becoming the fastest to $10 billion.Given that 2016 closed with $8.4 billion -- 26% annual growth -- and they are guiding the current fiscal year to $10.2 billion (+21% annual growth), it seems they are on their way.During the company's October analyst day, Salesforce updated the size of its TAM (total addressable market) to about $70 billion in 2016 and projected a CAGR of 11 percent to reach $105 billion by 2020. They have plenty of potential to grab more of that market share.And while the valuation is a headwind for the stock -- trading at over 6X sales -- the premier position in enterprise CRM is undisputed. If anybody can grab more of that TAM, it's CRM.Embedded: Salesforce Knows What It Means TooFor the past few months, I've been studying the sales software space and marketing ""enablement"" space via several web-centric ""mini-CRMs"" like HubSpot (HUBS), Infusionsoft, Marketo, ReEnvision Inbound, and ActiveCampaign.These and other SaaS platforms are integrating and automating the functions of marketing and sales for small and medium-sized businesses like never before.While these young upstarts potentially threaten CRM -- and Microsoft leads a beachhead assault with their buy-out of LinkedIn -- salesforce.com remains the ""killer app"" for many corporations at the enterprise level.Part of the reason is, of course, that once you have a customer relationship management and engagement platform ""embedded"" in your corporation's economic infrastructure, it's hard to ""kick them out of bed.""But another aspect is that Marc Benioff is still playing to win -- especially after the MSFT-LNKD coup (see my videoSaaSy B2B Sales Are in the Cloudsfor the story there).And so he keeps innovating and endearing his embedded software to his blue-chip enterprise clients. Here was the latest headline from February as they formally rolled-out the live version of the project they beta-launched in October...Salesforce Introduces Service Cloud Einstein, the World's #1 Intelligent Customer Service PlatformBottom line: CRM remains top intel for ""salesforces"" everywhere.Einstein Asks Watson for HelpThen, this week on March 6 came this announcement of a partnership...IBM and Salesforce today announced a global strategic partnership to deliver joint solutions designed to leverage artificial intelligence and enable companies to make smarter decisions, faster than ever before. With the partnership, IBM Watson, the leading AI platform for business, and Salesforce Einstein, AI that powers the world's #1 CRM, will seamlessly connect to enable an entirely new level of intelligent customer engagement across sales, service, marketing, commerce and more. IBM is also strategically investing in its Global Business Services capabilities for Salesforce with a new practice to help clients rapidly deploy the combined IBM Watson and Salesforce Einstein capabilities.The partnership will bring new insights from Watson directly into the Salesforce Intelligent Customer Success Platform, combining deep customer insights from Salesforce Einstein with Watson's structured and unstructured data across many sources and industries including weather, healthcare, financial services and retail. Together, Watson and Einstein will ingest, reason over and derive recommendations to accelerate decision making and drive greater customer success.In addition, IBM put a wolf on the prowl...""Bluewolf Dedicated Consulting Services and Expertise for Cognitive Solutions, Adding to IBM Strategic Services for Salesforce: Bluewolf, an IBM company, has formed a new practice to help clients rapidly deploy the combined IBM Watson and Salesforce Einstein capabilities. This new unit capitalizes on Bluewolf's over fifteen years of Salesforce implementations and their current portfolio of multiple Salesforce and Watson projects. Bluewolf will also develop new industry-specific accelerators used by enterprise clients to accelerate adoption of cognitive applications.""Never Underestimate Deep BlueThe brand that is IBM stands for persistent technological innovation and brain power. Under Ginni Rometty's leadership, the old mainframe maker continues to reinvent.And we haven't even talked about how they make cloud technologies accessible to companies outside the Fortune 1,000 with Bluemix, an app design and development platform.Coincidentally, IBM just held their Investor Briefing this week and analysts came away mostly positive on the transition from legacy products and services to higher-margin growth areas in Watson strategic initiatives.Wells Fargo raised their valuation range on shares to $175-$185 from $160-$170.RecommendationsI would accumulate these stocks in these ranges:NVDA: $85 to $95(despite the rich valuation at 32X forward estimates, my call is that we'll see new highs of ""$125 Before $75"")CRM: $77 to $82(Morgan Stanley raised their PT to $107, Wedbush to $102, and Cowen & Co. and Stifel both to $100)IBM: $165 to $175(this stock won't run away from you; it simply makes big swings that are fairly predictable)Disclosure: I own NVDA and CRM for the Zacks TAZR Trader service.Now See Our Private Investment IdeasWhile the above ideas are being shared with the public, other trades are hidden from everyone but selected members.

4 High-Yield Dividend Stocks You Don't Have to Babysit;3/9/2017;"For long-term dividend investors, the best type of stock is   one that can be bought and largely forgotten about, with the   occasional checkup to make sure those dividend checks aren't in   danger. A few of the Fool's contributors have identified four   high-yielddividend   stocksthat fit this description. Here's whyMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) ,Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF(NYSEMKT: VYM) ,ONEOK(NYSE: OKE) , andEnterprise Products Partners(NYSE: EPD) are great buy-and-hold dividend stocks.A solid tech dividendTim Green(Microsoft):Being a technology company, Microsoft is more susceptible to   disruption than other dividend-paying stalwarts. But it's not a   company that investors need to worry too much about. Under the   leadership of CEO Satya Nadella, Microsoft has shed its image as   a tech dinosaur and aggressively embraced cloud computing.   Microsoft's stranglehold on the productivity software market   remains intact, its cloud-computing platform is a strong No. 2   player, and innovations like the HoloLens augmented reality   headset could put Microsoft right at the center of the next   computing revolution.Image source: Microsoft.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');Microsoft's dividend, currently yielding about 2.4%, isn't all   that high. But it's superior to that of the average yield of   stocks in theS&P 500, which yields less than 2%. Microsoft produces an   incredible amount of free cash flow -- nearly $25 billion in   fiscal 2016. This fueled not only $11 billion in dividend   payments, putting the payout ratio at about 44%, but also $16   billion of share buybacks. There's still plenty of room to grow   the dividend going forward, even without much earnings   growth.Microsoft's cash-rich balance sheet is another reason the   stock is attractive to dividend investors aiming to buy and hold   for many years. Microsoft had net cash of $37.8 billion at the   end of the latest quarter, providing a massive cushion that can   sustain the dividend even in the roughest economic conditions.   While there are higher-yielding stocks available, Microsoft is a   good option for long-term investors.Taking a basket approach to high yieldsBrian Feroldi(Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF): It is natural for income-focused investors to want to own   stocks that offer up higher yields than the market in general.   However, picking the right high-yield stocks can be tricky, since   a massive payout can sometimes actually be a warning sign.One alternative that is available to all investors is to   instead invest in an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that is focused   on dividend stocks with above-average yields. If that sounds like   a smart way to go, then I'd suggest that you give the Vanguard   High Dividend Yield ETF a closer look.This passively managed ETF owns more than 400 stocks that have   higher yields than the market in general. Its biggest holdings   are all names that investors are familiar with -- think   Microsoft,ExxonMobil,Johnson & Johnson-- which also provides investors with an extra layer of   stability.The VYM currently offers a dividend yield of 3%, which is more   than 50% higher than that of the S&P 500 average yield.   Better yet, this fund's 10-year total return -- which accounts   for the reinvestment of dividends -- is neck and neck with   the S&P 500.VYM Total Return Pricedata byYCharts.Despite all of its benefits, Vanguard only charges a minuscule   0.08% expense ratio to access this ETF. Thus, if you are after a   high yield but don't want to pick individual stocks, the Vanguard   High Dividend Yield ETF could be an excellent choice for   you.This energy play is a naturalDan Caplinger(ONEOK):The plunge in energy prices in 2015 hurt companies throughout the   industry, and even midstream infrastructure plays like ONEOK took   big hits in their share prices. Yet after losing 70% of its share   price, ONEOK has surged in the past year, nearly tripling as   investors have figured out that not all companies have the same   exposure to crudeoil   pricesas others.ONEOK has an impressive slate of infrastructure assets,   helping in the gathering process of natural gas from the Permian   Basin, Rocky Mountain, and Mid-Continent regions of the U.S. and   then processing, storing, and transporting it to key market   centers in the energy industry. That business relies more on   production volume than on price, and although the producers that   ONEOK works with transport more natural gas when prices are   favorable, the energy transportation giant has still been able to   produce solid results as oil andnatural   gas priceshave rebounded.ONEOK currently has a yield of 4.5%, but that figure should go   up when the company completes its planned acquisition of itsONEOK Partners(NYSE: OKS) master limited partnership. Once the MLP deal is   complete, ONEOK expects to boost dividends by a fifth, which   should help the yield even further. As long as energy prices   remain strong enough to induce its clients to send natural gas   through its infrastructure network, ONEOK will be in position to   keep delivering income to its investors.A model of consistencyMatt DiLallo(Enterprise Products Partners): Pipeline giant Enterprise Products Partners has an excellent   track record of paying investors an above-average dividend. In   fact, since going public in 1998, the company has raised its   payout 59 times, including in each of the past 50 quarters. These   haven't been token increases, either, with its last payout   representing a 5.1% raise over the prior year. All these   increases have added up over the years, with the company   currently yielding a very generous 5.8%.That payout is about as safe as they come. First of all, more   than 85% of Enterprise's cash flow comes from fee-based service   contracts, which provides it with very stable cash flow.   Furthermore, the company pays out less than 80% of its cash flow,   which is well below the near-100% payout ratios of the average   MLP. Finally, the company has a top-notch balance sheet,   evidenced by the fact it has one of the highest credit ratings   among MLPs. Add it up, and Enterprise has the financial strength   to maintain its distribution rather easily.That said, the company is more likely to maintain its   distribution growth streak than simply keep things status quo.   Fueling that growth potential is the fact that it has $6.7   billion of growth projects under construction and several   additional projects under development. These new assets should   enable the company to continue growing its cash flow, giving it   more money to return to investors. Needless to say, this is one   dividend stock that will not cause investors any worry.10 stocks we like better than MicrosoftWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Qualcomm, Inc. Data-Center Chips Get Microsoft Corporation’s Blessing;3/8/2017;"Qualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM) is well known for its cellular modems and mobile   applications processors. Sales of such products make up the   overwhelming majority of its semiconductor revenues. Although   these businesses have been good to the chipmaker, the company is   looking to bring its chip-design expertise into new markets.The company has been known to be working on data-center   processor designs for quite some time, though it only formally   unveiled its intent to compete in this market in late 2015.Qualcomm's Centriq 2400 server processor. Image source:     Qualcomm.makeArticleAd();Qualcomm kicked off its efforts here when it began sampling   its first server chip -- a 24-core processor built using a   foundry 14/16-nanometer technology -- in late 2015. The company   began sampling a follow-on product -- a 48-core product built   using a foundry 10-nanometer technology -- in late 2016, with   commercial shipments expected to begin in the second half of   2017.Qualcomm's server-chip efforts seemingly got server-software   giantMicrosoft's(NASDAQ: MSFT) blessing in a March 8 announcement. Let's take a   closer look.Bringing Windows to Qualcomm's ARM-based server     chipsOne of the hurdles to the adoption of processors built using   the ARM architecture in the server market has been the lack of   software infrastructure. Most data-center software today is   written for chips that implementIntel(NASDAQ: INTC) Architecture. This is unsurprising, as Intel   has an overwhelmingly dominant market-share position in the   server-processor market.In a press release, Qualcomm announced that it's working with   Microsoft to enable ""a variety of cloud [server] workloads to run   on the Microsoft Azure cloud platform powered by Qualcomm Centriq   2400 server solutions."" Qualcomm also says that its   data-center-focused division, QDT (Qualcomm Datacenter   Technologies), ""has been working with Microsoft for several years   on ARM-based server enablement and has onsite engineering at   Microsoft to collaboratively optimize a version of Windows   Server, for Microsoft's internal use in its data centers, on   Qualcomm Centriq 2400-based systems.""From this press release, it doesn't look as though Microsoft   is planning to sell the Qualcomm/ARM compatible Windows Server to   other server makers quite yet. The release explicitly highlights   that this version of Windows is ""for Microsoft's internal use in   its data centers.""That said, perBloomberg, Microsoft's Azure cloud service is ""No. 2 in cloud   infrastructure behindAmazon, and it's one of the biggest server buyers,"" so the opportunity   here for Qualcomm seems reasonably large and could get larger   should Microsoft make Windows Server on ARM -- and thus on   Qualcomm chips -- more widely available down the line.Success, if it comes, takes timeQualcomm seems to be doing a lot of software ecosystem work to   allow its chips to be a viable alternative in the server market.   That's the good news for Qualcomm. However, investors should   be careful in setting their expectations around the company's   server-chip business.Intel, the incumbent player, still has the advantage of   incumbency, the ability to offer many platform components as a   ""one stop shop"" (i.e. 3D XPoint memory, Ethernet   controllers/switches, FPGAs, Xeon Phi accelerators, and so on).   It also invests heavily in influencing major server buyers and   software vendors to optimize their codes to take advantage of the   features and capabilities of Intel's chips.Intel's 3D XPoint memory. Image source: Intel.Any significant share gains for Qualcomm, should they   ultimately happen, aren't likely to happen overnight. They'll   take time, so it's probably unwise for investors to model in   significant revenue/unit share gains in the near term.Further, if Qualcomm can't ultimately generate enough revenue   from server chip/platform sales to generate a reasonable return   on what is surely a significant investment -- product development   and marketing are not cheap -- then there's a risk that the   company will, at some point down the line, simply shutter the   efforts.But for now, it will be interesting to see how Qualcomm's   product offerings and go-to-market strategy evolves, and how much   commercial success it can ultimately achieve.10 stocks we like better than QualcommWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Why Alphabet and Microsoft Should Start Disclosing Cloud Revenue;3/8/2017;"Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) is currently hosting its Google   Cloud Next '17 developer conference, which kicked off earlier   today in San Francisco and runs through March 10. Speaking at the   event, Google CEO Sundar Pichai made it clear that he sees Google   Cloud as an incredibly important part of the search giant's   future, and not just one of the company's many side bets. ""To me,   Google Cloud is a natural extension of our mission to make the   world's information accessible and usable,"" Pichai said.The distinction is that while search helps regular users   access information, cloud computing infrastructure and the   related value-added services like analytics help the enterprise   organize and access their information. The cloud infrastructure   market is booming, growing 49% last year to $38.1 billion,   according to market researcher Canalys. It's expected to jump   another 46% this year to $55.8 billion. As the market grows, so,   too, does the impact on the financials of the major players:   Google Cloud,Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Azure, andAmazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) AWS.Google data center in Council Bluffs, Iowa. Image source:     Google.makeArticleAd();As such, the former two should start disclosing exactly how   much cloud revenue they're bringing in.Follow Amazon's leadI never thought I'd see the day when Amazon was leading the   way in investor transparency, given the e-commerce giant's   long-standing refusal to share various operating metrics that are   pertinent to investors. Yet, when it comes to AWS and cloud   revenue, Amazon is doing just that; Amazon started sharing AWS   financials in 2015. AWS revenue was $12.2 billion last year,   translating into $3.1 billion in operating income.Microsoft only discloses growth rates for Azure (up 93% last   quarter), but lacking a base number, that data point is less   meaningful. We do know that total revenue in Microsoft's   intelligent cloud segment, which includes Azure among other   offerings, was $6.9 billion last quarter, resulting in $2.4   billion in operating income. Lacking an official figure, JPMorgan   analysts estimate Azure revenue for all of 2016 was $2.7 billion,   which would make AWS nearly five times bigger.Google includes Google Cloud revenue within its Google other   revenues segment, which generated a hair over $10 billion in   sales in 2016. That also includes revenue from Google Play as   well as the company's growing hardware portfolio. One   particularly prominent Google Cloud customer that just went   public likely spent between $400 million to $450 million last   year, and is committed to $400 million per year for thenext five years, so there's that.Sharing is caringYou could reasonably argue that AWS is far more important to   Amazon than its peers' respective cloud businesses, though,   specifically since AWS is by far the market leaderandit's such a major contributor to profitability due to razor-thin   margins in the core e-commerce business. In contrast, Google and   Microsoft enjoy much higher gross margin, as they each specialize   in software and services.Still, the cloud infrastructure market is only going to become   increasingly important in the years ahead, and investors will   want to see the results from the three largest players to assess   each company's competitiveness. Google and Microsoft should start   sharing more, especially if it's as important as Pichai says it   is.10 stocks we like better than AlphabetWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock Looks Overbought. It Isn’t.;3/8/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFew names in the markets have almost universal appeal.Microsoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of them. Sure,Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) products have more appeal,Alphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG,NASDAQ:GOOGL) is more popular andAmazon.com, Inc(NASDAQ:AMZN) is more engaging, but let's give credit where credit is due. Most of us have grown up with Microsoft programs, and we continue to use them frequently to this day.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockOf course, emotional sentiment only goes so far. To prove its relevance in a changing world, Microsoft must deliver the goods. For most of this decade, the results for Microsoft stock have been fantastic.We're talking five out of seven years in the black, with an average annual profit of nearly 14%. In addition, MSFT stock has enjoyed four consecutive years of double-digit growth.I don't care how many caveats you can mention about the proverbial old dog … that's a trick that's tough to master at any age. Seemingly, the change at the top of the Microsoft war room, from Steve Ballmer to Satya Nadella, is working wonders. Most importantly, the willingness to aggressively push into new territory is encouraging for potential Microsoft shareholders.9 Stocks to Buy That Are Growing Faster Than AmazonInvestorPlace contributor Will Ashworth took this confidence further by declaring that MSFT stock willhit $80 this year. Is this wishful thinking, or is there more to this than mere bravado?Challenges Facing MSFT stockFirst things first - I admire the guts Ashworth displayed. That's putting yourself out there and giving clarity to your point of view. It's something I wish I could see in Washington, but that's a whole different ballgame.With MSFT stock specifically, the bullish argument is an easy one, but so is the cautious approach. Shares have soared despite the wave of competition in the consumer tech sector. InvestorPlace contributor Vince Martin speaks for a lot of people whenhe wrote, ""I continue to be surprised at the strength shown by Microsoft stock. MSFT stock has risen roughly 150% in just four years - despite little movement in profits.""The lack of fundamental growth is even more perplexing when you consider Microsoft's position within the fierce environment. The company is either lagging, or is getting challenged by rising up-and-comers. Martin writes:""For Office 365,Tableau Software Inc(NYSE:DATA) is challenging Excel - and 27% revenue growth in 2016 suggests DATA is taking share from MSFT. Behemoths likeOracle Corporation(NYSE:ORCL) and many others are in the cloud space. Microsoft's Dynamics CRM product is a distant second tosalesforce.com, inc. (NYSE:CRM).""A huge concern for those trading MSFT stock is the market capitalization. I'm not a fan of focusing on any one metric. Still, with its equity valued at half a trillion dollars, you have to take a step back. Is Microsoft stock really worth that much?Click to EnlargeKeep in mind that despite four consecutive years of double-digit growth, the magnitude has also declined. The first strike was 39.5% in 2013, followed by performances of 28.4%, 21.9% and 16.5%.Microsoft Stock Is a Proven WinnerAdmittedly, that's not the direction the trend should go. Nevertheless, I think Ashworth is going to be a happy camper. Like other tech names, Microsoft stock starts off the year fairly slowly. For example, its first quarter returns are a relatively pedestrian 8%.But at year's end, the average return jumps up to 30.7%, nearly four times higher. That also means that those who are concerned about this year's slow start for MSFT stock shouldn't be.The other attribute that is remarkable about Microsoft is its resiliency. Between 2000 and 2011, MSFT stock suffered a negative Q1 performance ten times. But in four of those instances, shares managed to claw back positive returns for the year. That provides a lot of security for those making strongly optimistic calls for Microsoft stock.While investors have reason to look at MSFT cautiously, I think Wall Street is giving Nadella and company a fair shake. They want to see what it can do with its long-term strategy, and the signs are encouraging. A prime example is Microsoft'shigh-profile acquisitionofLinkedIn. By integrating its intellectual capital with Microsoft's vast networks, it can do serious damage in the social media sphere.Snap Inc (SNAP) Stock: Stay Away at All Costs!Overall, $80 for Microsoft stock is very reasonable. Although not dominant, it's competing well in some of the most exciting and high-growth sectors. Both the company and the markets are loving the change in leadership and culture. Finally, Microsoft continues to find ways to do well, even in the most trying of circumstances. The only question is, can I be the first to call $100 in 2018?As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace3 Drug Stocks Hit by Trump's Call for Lower Prices4 Food Stocks at Risk Thanks to Record HeatThe postMicrosoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock Looks Overbought.

Why FireEye Inc (FEYE) Stock Is a Terribly Good Speculation Pick;3/8/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThere's a reason why many analysts are loathe to cover technology firms - they're just too damn volatile. Magnify that by three or four times for companies in burgeoning industries like cybersecurity.FireEye Inc(NASDAQ:FEYE) is a prime example of sound logic convincing you to go long, only to wish you hadn't. Unless you're the Wall Street equivalent of Tom Brady, you can't take the kind of hits FEYE stock has absorbed and simply get away with it.makeArticleAd();Source:David via Flickr (Modified)I mean, who doesn't love cybersecurity? Whether you're talking about PC viruses or possibly altering the presidential election, cybersecurity is a hot-button issue.Companies like FEYE are on the forefront of this ever-expanding and dynamic sector.Because of this distinct dynamism, you'd figure that there's plenty of room for competitors. I doubt that cyber-criminals are always going to use the same tricks. Thus, coming to market first may not necessarily be the absolute advantage that it is for other industries.To confirm this point, FireEye stock started off with great fanfare. Investors were initially enthused by its robust momentum. But quickly, FEYE stock began to lose favor. Indeed, when you look at the organization topically, it has never returned a profit for the year. And no, I'm not going to include their extremely shortened 2013 debut.When you look at analyst coverage overall, you'd be hard-pressed to find anybody sticking their neck out for FireEye stock. Jeff Reeves, executive editor of InvestorPlace, summed it up unambiguously when hewrote, ""FEYE Stock Has Crashed for Good."" This was written in early August of 2016. Since then, FEYE has lost nearly 25% in the markets.Cybersecurity Is Big Enough for FEYE StockSo is there any hope for this long-embattled company? At first, the fundamentals don't look so hot for FEYE stock. As InvestorPlace writer and IPO Playbook editor Tom Taulli notes, FEYE's most recentearnings reportwas terrible. More ominously, their guidance for the first quarter is pedestrian, to say the least, and FireEye stock subsequently got pounded.8 Dividend Growth Stocks Raising The BarCompetitively, FEYE has to go up against two tailwinds. Primarily, they were late to the game in terms of cloud integration, so they have some catch-up to do. On the broader front, the company faces serious pressure from industry leadersPalo Alto Networks Inc(NYSE:PANW) andFortinet Inc(NASDAQ:FTNT).However, FEYE stock also has to watch out for old guard firms likeMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT). They've got the resources to exercise their ""mid-life crisis"" of breaking into new sectors.At the same time, we have to appreciate the scale of the cybersecurity landscape. According toSymantec Corporation(NASDAQ:SYMC) CEO Greg Clack, 39% of North American residents have beenimpacted by cybercrimein 2016. In his words, ""I think that's a very big crisis."" Naturally, Mr. Clack is thinking specifically of his organization's solutions. But the reality is that FEYE has a solid chance of making up for lost ground.Furthermore, con artists are constantly getting creative with theirnefarious activities. Many of these are exposed by government watchdogs, but by that point, the con is long gone. You can only imagine the possibilities with cybercrime. So yes, FEYE stock looks absolutely terrible now, I'll concede. But due to the evolving nature of cybercrime, it's risky to assume that FireEye stock will forever be a dud.The Worst for FireEye Stock Is Behind ItBased on the actions of investors, I think the company is in the early stages of a turnaround. Long-term, the magnitude of volatility in FEYE stock is slowing significantly.Click to EnlargeFor example, in 2016, the average closing price for FireEye stock was $15.19. That's nearly a 60% loss from the prior year average of $37.64. But so far this year, FEYE stock averages $12.22, which is a more modest loss from last year of 19.6%.Another interesting point is that shares could have fallen much further than it did. Everyone agrees that 2016 was a choppy period for FEYE, yet the lowest closing price last year was $11.01.Why Boeing Co (BA) Stock Will Hit Turbulence in 2017Presently, the average close is 11% higher than this figure. Also, its present market value is only a few cents shy of 2016's closing low. That's not a great statistic, I know. But it leaves the impression that the worst of the volatility may be over.My final contrarian argument is that we're not dealing with a fly-by-night operation. FEYE CEO Kevin Mandia was a former U.S. Air Force intelligence officer, and is widely considered a cybersecurity expert. This is not someone that is going to jeopardize his reputation on a whim. I'd also give FireEye stock a higher chance of success based on this much-needed, highly demanded industry.Ultimately, I understand the hesitation of FEYE stock. It has simply lost too much value to be termed a stable investment. But for those with some risk capital to play with, FireEye stock is a compelling bet. The market losses are being pared, and you have substantial intellectual firepower on the executive team.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 Dangerous Dividend Stocks to Dump Now7 Stocks to Buy That Are ALMOST in Buffett Buying RangeThe postWhy FireEye Inc (FEYE) Stock Is a Terribly Good Speculation Pickappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Retirees, Maximize Your Income From Dividends;3/8/2017;"Dividend investing is supposed to be a bit like watching grass grow: steady progress, few surprises. But lately, investors holding dividend-paying stocks have suffered some jarring setbacks.SEE ALSO:8 Great Dividend Stocks for RetireesHigher-yielding sectors such as utilities and real estate investment trusts saw valuations soar through much of 2016, then suffered sharp pullbacks later in the year. Analysts see more pain ahead for high-dividend-yielding stocks as interest rates start to rise, diverting income-focused investors from stocks into bonds. A stretch of stagnant earnings growth, meanwhile, put the brakes on the double-digit dividend growth that investors have grown accustomed to since the financial crisis. Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dividends climbed just 5% in 2016.""It's realistic to start thinking that the best might be over in terms of dividend growth,"" says Christine Benz, director of personal finance at investment-research firmMorningstar.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');Does this mean older investors should scale back dividend holdings? Hardly. The idea of getting income from stocks still ""makes a lot of sense, particularly in this low-rate world,"" says Tony DeSpirito, co-manager ofBlackRock Equity Dividend fund. At roughly 2.5%, the yield on theRussell 1000 Value Indexis about the same as the yield on the 10-year Treasury, he notes. But while the Treasury bond offers a fixed coupon, stocks offer potential dividend growth and share-price appreciation.The challenge is to pick the rightdividend stocksor funds. Rounding up the usual suspects--high dividend-yielding utilities, REITs, consumer staples and telecom stocks--may not be the best approach. One reason: You'd be ignoring some of the biggest dividend-paying sectors, including technology and financials.The higher-yielding stocks also look expensive, even after their late-2016 sell-off, money managers say. Investors have used them as bond substitutes in a low-rate era, and as rates rise, these bond proxies will suffer more than lower dividend-yielders.Stocks that can deliver steady dividend growth, rather than the richest yields, offer the most fertile ground for dividend investors. These holdings look cheaper than the high-yielders, they can hold up well in a rising-rate environment, and they can offer a buffer against market volatility.You can maximize the income you get from these holdings by minimizing fees and taxes. In a dividend-focused mutual fund, a lofty expense ratio can chew through most of your yield. And although the 15% tax rate paid by most investors on qualified dividends seems relatively benign, many holdings favored by dividend investors and dividend funds don't get this treatment. Most REIT payouts, for example, are taxed as ordinary income.Follow these tips to build a dividend portfolio that can deliver reliable income despite rising rates and slowing dividend growth--so you can get back to watching the grass grow.Go for GrowthReliable dividend growers have proved resilient during the roughest times in the market. In a recent study, S&P Dow Jones Indices compared the performance of dividend ""aristocrats""--S&P Composite 1500 stocks that have raised their dividends every year for at least 20 years--against high-yielding stocks in the S&P 500. During the 15 worst months for the broader stock market from the end of 1999 through September 2016, the aristocrats lost 5.9%, on average, versus an 8.6% loss for the high-yielders and an 8.9% average decline for the S&P 1500.Thearistocrats tend to be more resilientduring the worst market downturns in part because raising dividends year after year reflects a certain level of financial health and discipline, S&P notes.So where can you find dependable dividend growers at a decent price? For old-school dividend investors raised on Ma Bell and Coca-Cola, the answers may be a bit surprising.One sector that's highly favored by value-minded dividend fund managers these days: technology. In 2016, the sector surpassed financials to become the biggest contributor to S&P 500 dividends, accounting for 15.5% of payouts.SEE ALSO:25 Dividend Stocks You Can Buy and Hold ForeverMature tech companies, such as Microsoft (symbolMSFT; recent price, $64), Cisco Systems (CSCO, $32) and Qualcomm (QCOM, $54), generate loads of free cash flow and are finding fewer opportunities to re-invest in their businesses, says Mike Liss, co-manager of theAmerican Century Value fund. That leaves them with an ""ability to increase their dividends at a rate better than the average stock,"" Liss says.Microsoft, which yields 2.3%, has nearly doubled its quarterly dividend in the past five years, to 39 cents a share. Money managers see more healthy dividend growth ahead as the company's leadership in cloud computing improves its earnings-growth prospects.Cisco, which yields 3.3%, is known for making the switches and routers that move data around computer networks. But Cisco is also expanding into faster-growing areas such as collaboration and security. The company has boosted its dividend every year since initiating its payout in 2011.Patient investors should also take a look at Qualcomm, which yields 3.8%, says John Buckingham, chief investment officer atAFAM Capitaland manager of theAl Frank fund. The stock has been crushed this year, in part because Apple is suing Qualcomm over its business practices, and it now trades at just 11 times analysts' estimate of earnings in the coming year. Buckingham believes the litigation will ultimately be settled and ""the magnitude of the decline has created opportunity for those who can take a long-term view.""Look for Healthy PayoutsHealth care stocks have looked rather sickly lately. Concerns about repeal of the Affordable Care Act, as well as talk from Washington about negotiating lower drug prices, have weighed on the sector.But the political noise has created an opportunity for long-term dividend investors, particularly in drug stocks. ""If you continue to create drugs that are innovative and meet unmet needs, you're going to get premium pricing for those products,"" Liss says.Holdings in Liss's fund include drug giants Pfizer (PFE, $32) and Merck (MRK, $64). Pfizer yields 3.8% and trades at just 13 times analysts' estimate of its full-year earnings. While the loss of patent protection on several drugs is a headwind, the company maintains an impressive portfolio of patent-protected drugs and is launching several potential best-sellers in cancer, immunology and other areas.Like Pfizer, Merck has a strong pipeline of new drugs to balance out upcoming patent losses. Cancer drug Keytruda has been a notable success as the company sharpens its focus on unmet medical needs. Merck yields 2.9% and has raised its dividend six years in a row.Swiss drug giants Roche Holding (RHHBY, $30) and Novartis (NVS, $75) also look like good values, says Matt Burdett, associate portfolio manager atThornburg Investment Management. Pricey biologics, which tend to have less generic competition, account for a large portion of Roche's drug sales, and Roche also has a strong diagnostics business. The stock yields 3.4%.Novartis, which yields 3.6%, is well diversified with pharmaceuticals, eye care and other businesses. The company is launching several drugs in key areas such as cancer and heart failure.Guard Against Rising RatesRising rates generally aren't disastrous for dividend stocks. Looking at the two-, three- and five-year periods following the initiation of Federal Reserve rate-hiking cycles dating back to 1954, dividend payers have outperformed non-dividend payers, according to AFAM Capital.But when interest rates rise, some dividend payers do suffer. In recent research, Morningstar looked at rising-rate periods from May 1953 through the end of 2016. The 30% of stocks with the highest yields lost about 1.5%, on average, while the 30% with the lowest yields gained 3.2%.SEE ALSO:8 Dow Dividend Stocks You Can Buy and Hold ForeverMany dividend-focused fund managers are favoring a sector that stands to benefit from rising rates: financials. As rates rise, banks may see an improvement in their net interest margins--a measure of lending profitability. What's more, banks are likely to see looser capital requirements and other deregulation under the new administration, says Sandy Pomeroy, co-manager of theNeuberger Berman Equity Income fund. With capital freed up, banks may have more flexibility to boost their dividends.Many big bank stocks saw sharp run-ups after the election. One that still looks attractively valued is Bank of America (BAC, $23), says Matt Quinlan, co-manager of theFranklin Income fund. At 1.1%, it doesn't have the richest yield, but it trades for less than book value. The bank has slowly recovered from its ill-advised 2008 acquisition of mortgage lender Countrywide Financial and has sharply cut costs in recent years.Rising rates are also ""a positive for insurance companies who have substantial dollars in fixed income,"" Buckingham says. He likes MetLife (MET, $53), which yields 3% and trades at just 10 times analysts' estimate of its full-year earnings. The company is spinning off a U.S. retail unit, a move that analysts see as helping MetLife generate more stable cash flow.Focus on FundsIf you're shopping for a dividend-focused mutual fund, keep a close eye on fees. A mutual fund's expense ratio eats into its yield. So ""the relationship between expense ratio and income is quite direct,"" Benz says.One high-quality, low-cost fund is Vanguard Dividend Appreciation (VIG), an exchange-traded fund that yields 2.1% and charges just 0.09% annually. It tracks the Nasdaq U.S. Dividend Achievers Select Index, which includes companies that have boosted dividends for at least 10 consecutive years.Another low-cost option: Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD). The fund tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index, which includes companies that not only have paid dividends for 10 years in a row but also have strong cash-flow-to-debt ratios, return on equity, dividend yield and dividend growth. The fund yields 2.9% and charges just 0.07% annually.Investors looking to avoid the highest yielders might also consider iShares Core Dividend Growth ETF (DGRO). It tracks the Morningstar U.S. Dividend Growth Index, which excludes stocks with yields in the top 10% of the broader stock universe. The fund charges 0.08% annually and yields 2.3%.Whether you're choosing a dividend-focused fund or picking your own stocks, pay attention to the potential tax hit. Qualified dividends, which include most U.S. stock dividends, get favorable tax treatment. Taxpayers in the 25% to 35% tax brackets pay 15% on qualified dividends. Taxpayers in the 10% and 15% brackets pay zero; those above the 35% bracket pay 20%. If your adjusted gross income is more than $200,000 for singles or $250,000 for married couples, you'll owe an additional 3.8% on your net investment income, including qualified dividends.But many holdings favored by dividend investors don't pay qualified dividends. Payouts from REITs, some foreign stocks and convertibles can be taxed as ordinary income. With master limited partnerships, a large chunk of distributions is typically tax-deferred, but investors may pay a combination of capital-gains and ordinary-income tax rates when they sell their units.""It's worth looking under the hood"" of dividend-focused funds because many of these funds hold non-qualified dividend payers, Benz says. She points toAmerican Century Equity Income, which is a high-quality fund but tends to hold some non-qualified dividend payers such as convertibles. The fund's 10-year tax-cost ratio is 1.8, according to Morningstar, meaning that investors have lost an average annual 1.8% of assets to taxes. Investors inVanguard Dividend Appreciation Index fund, which holds only common stocks, have sacrificed far less to taxes, losing an average annual 0.73% over the period.Another taxing question for dividend investors is whether to hold foreign dividend-paying stocks--or funds that invest in those stocks--in an IRA. Many countries withhold taxes from dividends that their companies pay to overseas investors. U.S. investors are taxed a second time on those dividends, either when they report dividend income for their taxable accounts or withdraw money from their IRA. You can claim a foreign tax credit on your federal return for the taxes withheld by the foreign country--but only if you hold the stocks in a taxable account. If you hold the investments in an IRA, there's no way to recoup the foreign taxes paid.""If you have an IRA and a taxable account, put the foreign stocks or foreign stock funds into the taxable account,"" says John Burke, a financial adviser atBurke Financial Strategies, in Iselin, N.J. But there's a caveat: Companies in countries that don't have a tax treaty with the U.S. may pay non-qualified dividends, making them a poor fit for a taxable account. Most countries have a tax treaty with the U.S., but there are significant exceptions such as Brazil, Chile and Singapore.TAKE OUR QUIZ:Test Your Investing IQ"

Microsoft's Slack Rival Is Almost Ready for Prime Time;3/7/2017;"Watch out, Slack.Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) is coming after you.The software giant launched a Slack rival called Microsoft   Teams inNovember, leveraging the stronger Microsoft brand instead of calling it   Skype Teams, which Microsoft had been rumored to be considering.   At the time, it was a limited launch with only a handful of   customers being able to preview the offering. Microsoft is now   ready to roll out Microsoft Teams with general availability,   making good on its prior target of the first quarter of 2017 for   general availability.A week from today, Microsoft will host an online event to   launch Microsoft Teams more broadly.makeArticleAd();Microsoft Teams looks an awful lot like Slack. Image source:     Microsoft.Bundled pricing undercuts SlackMicrosoft Teams has a lot of potential, mostly thanks to   Microsoft's already-strong position within enterprise   productivity software. By including Microsoft Teams in certain   bundles of Office 365 and promising deeper integrations with   Office, the company can make a compelling pitch to enterprise   customers. Combined with the fact that the interface is nearly   identical, the switching costs for users would be fairly   manageable as well since Microsoft Teams will feel familiar for   Slack users.In terms of pricing, here are the Office 365 plans that   include Teams. The more expensive plans include many other   features beyond Teams.PlanCost (Annual Commitment)Cost (Monthly Commitment)Office 365 Business Essentials$5 per user per month$6 per user per monthOffice 365 Business Premium$12.50 per user per month$15 per user per monthOffice 365 Enterprise E1$8 per user per monthN/AOffice 365 Enterprise E3$20 per user per monthN/AOffice 365 Enterprise E5$35 per user per monthN/AData source: Microsoft.Compare those prices with Slack's offerings (not including   Slack's free tier).PlanCost (Annual Commitment)Cost (Monthly Commitment)Slack Standard$6.67 per user per month$8 per user per monthSlack Plus$12.50 per user per month$15 per user per monthData source: Slack.Considering how much more is included in the various Office   365 plans, Microsoft has the potential to deliver quite a bit of   value compared to Slack, since Slack's prices only include its   chat offering. To be clear, Slack is a great chat and   collaboration tool, but Microsoft can appeal better to a limited   IT budget while replicating many of the things that make Slack so   good (which is also why investors should berelieved that Microsoft didn't spend $8 billion   to acquire Slack). That's a key benefit of Microsoft's scale, since it has plenty   of development resources and can compete aggressively, bundling   Teams with a slew of other offerings.Slack announced Slack Enterprise Grid in January, which is   better equipped to handle the needs of larger organizations.   Pricing information is not publicly listed, and prospective   enterprise customers need to get in touch with Slack to negotiate   rates.It's also worth pointing out that Microsoftisn't the only tech giantthat wants a piece of Slack's market share, so this market is   only going to get more competitive.10 stocks we like better than MicrosoftWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Will Salesforce.com, Inc. (CRM) Sell Out to International Business Machines Corp. (IBM)?;3/7/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSalesforce.com, Inc.(NYSE:CRM), whose rapid growth makes up for a compelling shortage of earnings, warned shareholders that its first quarter may not be what they hope for. Investors have yet to show their feelings by fleeing CRM stock, however.makeArticleAd();Source:TopoI6 Via FlickrInstead, analysts listened to the soothing tones of its earnings call, where the company bragged about its past and predicted $10 billion in revenue for the coming year.Few seem to have noticed the fine print.Profits for the first quarterare going to be down. That $10 billion in revenue is not going to represent much growth over the fourth quarter's $2.3 billion sale rate.Slower growth could hammer the stock, whose market cap of $57 billion means a price to sales ratio of 5.7, assuming the company meets its estimates. That's a ratio comparable to that ofAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL), only without the profits of Google.For CRM stock, the future is now. But perhaps, by forging an alliance withInternational Business Machines Corp.(NYSE:IBM), its future now might be in its past.Looking Beyond the CloudSalesforce has more than doubled its revenues since 2012 based on cloud applications. The company's ticker symbol, CRM, stands for Customer Relationship Management, the first major enterprise database application to move from corporate data centers into less-expensive clouds. But since then the company has built a full suite of such applications, and all have been successful.7 Stocks That Will Hit All-Time Lows in 2017The enterprise cloud has been very, very good for Salesforce.com, and competitors have done more than take notice. Cloud is now the default home of major database applications. Competitors likeMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT),Oracle Corporation(NYSE:ORCL) and IBM all now brag about the size of their clouds, and the sophistication of enterprise applications built on them.The S-shaped ""sales curve,"" of slow growth in a new market, rocket-like growth as mass markets adopt something and slower growth once that is achieved, is approaching the end of the line for cloud. CRM stock bulls insist that things like the internet of thingswill keep growth going, but each new niche now brings big-time competitors with it, such asGeneral Electric Company(NYSE:GE), which calls its industrial IoT cloud Predix.Alliance TimeAs markets mature, they consolidate. Competitors pair up, starting with alliances, then moving naturally toward mergers. Having fewer competitors means they can maintain pricing, and margins, even as growth slows.This is why some analysts are pushinga merger-of-equals that won't happenbetween Salesforce andAdobe Systems Inc.(NASDAQ:ADBE), whose ""Creative Cloud"" applications would seem a natural fit.Salesforce's strategy has been to pick-off smaller application spaces as they appear, as with its 2016 buy ofDemandware, which serves online merchants, acquired for $2.8 billion. The company made10 acquisitions during 2016, and in January it continued this withSequence, which designs user interfaces, a business now dubbed UX for User Experience.As a software house, rather than a hardware company, Salesforce has always had to manage its hosting carefully. Its original code came from Oracle, and the companies have had a fraught existence. So over the years, Salesforce has added Microsoft andAmazon.com Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) toits partner list, although these relationships are, like love, subject to change on the first suspicion of betrayal.Snap Inc (SNAP) Stock: Stay Away at All Costs!You canadd IBM to the list. Salesforce will now mix its data with IBM's Watson - a quick route into artificial intelligence and, perhaps, into IBM itself.Where the Ride Ends for CRM StockI believe the end of the ride for Salesforce is in sight and IBM would make a compelling destination. IBM now sells at half its sales, its revenues have been declining for years, and Salesforce could halt that slide. With CEO Virginia Rometty approaching 60, often a retirement age at Big Blue, Benioff might make a natural successor at age 52.Benioff would also give IBM a more entrepreneurial face, and IBM would give him a much bigger playing field on which to perform cloud magic. He has been telling all who would listen that a ""roaring"" market meansSalesforce is not interested in acquisitions.How about a sale?Dana Blankenhornis a financial and technology journalist.

Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA) Stock Can Still Win BIG in Cloud;3/7/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAlibaba Group Holding Ltd(NYSE:BABA) founder and Executive Chairman Jack Ma has a lot of irons in the fire; nowhere is that truer than in his fight to take onAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) in the global race for enterprise cloud computing dominance. Right now, it's not even close - Amazon is leading by a country mile, but BABA is quickly closing the gap between the two and that's a good thing if you own Alibaba stock.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockAmazonenteredthe cloud computing business in 2006. Amazon Web Services (AWS) now generates more than $3.1 billion in operating income (fiscal 2016) from $12.2 billion in revenue, a juicy operating margin of 25.4%.This was considerably higher than the $1.1 billion it generated from $123.8 billion (0.90% operating margin) in revenue from its e-commerce and Amazon Prime membership fees.It's easy to understand why BABA wants in on Amazon's action - there's lots of money to be made from the cloud.What's Going on With Alibaba Stock and the Cloud?In Q3 2016, Alibaba went over the $1 billion annual run rate in cloud computing revenue generating $254 million from 765,000 paying customers, up 115% and 100% year-over-year respectively. Most importantly, its cloud computing business had an operating loss of just $49 million, 18.3% less than its Q2 2016 operating loss of$60 million.That's great news for Alibaba stock because at this rate, it should be in the black by sometime in fiscal 2017 and that will add to the already significant operating profits it generates from its core e-commerce business -$4 billionin the third quarter alone, a mouth-watering operating margin of 59.7%.7 Stocks That Will Hit All-Time Lows in 2017Put another way, BABA's cloud computing segment along with its other money-losing businesses lost $976 million in the third quarter on revenue of $961 million; essentially, it lost a dollar for every dollar of revenue.That's insane.Alibaba generated$5.5 billionin operating profit through the first nine months of fiscal 2016 despite losses in other areas totaling $2.8 billion. Amazon generated $4.2 billion in operating income from more than 10 times the revenue.There are many reasons why you might want to own Amazon's stock (Jeff Bezosis a big one) but consider how valuable BABA stock would be were its cloud computing business generating operating profit margins similar to AWS.Alibaba's cloud computing business would go from an annual loss of $225 million ($169 million operating loss in Q3 2016 on an annualized basis) on $1 billion in revenue to an operating profit of $250 million on the same revenue, a $475 million difference.""Our goal is to overtake Amazon in four years, whether that's in customers, technology, or worldwide scale,"" Simon Hu, the head of Alibaba's cloud businesstoldReutersin 2015. ""Amazon, Microsoft and others have already laid the groundwork for us by educating the markets about cloud in the U.S. and Europe, so we have an even better opportunity to join in the competition.""Estimates put the global cloud computing business at $20 billion. However, given Amazon's AWS revenue in 2016 was $12.2 billion,Microsoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) is coming on in this area and thought to be in thesecondspot behind AMZN and Alibaba's annual run rate is over $1 billion, the number is likely much higher.Why Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Could Have More Problems Than You ThinkAccording to TechCrunch, Synergy Research Group analyst John Dinsdale revealed that ""For cloud infrastructure services (IaaS, PaaS, Hosted Private Cloud services) Alibaba is now ranked sixth, based on worldwide revenues in Q4. For China specifically, while AWS and Microsoft are in the top five ranking in China, the market is led by Alibaba (a long way out in front) followed by China Telecom. Alibaba market share is running at 40 percent [in China] and has been increasing with time.""Bottom Line on BABA StockInterestingly, the fact that BABA stock was late to the cloud computing party, might actually work in its favor because large companies are far more open to working in the cloud these days than they were a decade ago when Amazon got in the business.Therefore, you could argue that the company's investment in the cloud, albeit several billion dollars, is still far less risky than Amazon's initial moves back in 2006.While there are many tentacles to the Alibaba stock, cloud computing is one that will continue to reap dividends for BABA stock in the years to come.As of this writing, Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace7 Telecom Stocks That Are High-Yield Money Traps5 Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy in MarchThe postAlibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA) Stock Can Still Win BIG in Cloudappeared first onInvestorPlace."

6 Things You Didn't Know About Baidu, Inc.;3/6/2017;"Many tech investors are probably familiar with the basic facts   aboutBaidu(NASDAQ: BIDU) -- it's the biggest search engine in China, it has   a growing ecosystem of cloud-based services likeAlphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google, and it benefited greatly   from Google's exit from the mainland Chinese market in 2010.Those are the bullet points in the growth story that boosted   Baidu stock by nearly 1,500% over the past decade. But today,   we'll take a look at six lesser-known facts about the ""Chinese   Google"" which many investors might have overlooked.Image source: Author's screenshot.makeArticleAd();1. CEO Robin Li cut his teeth in the U.S. tech     industryAfter earning a master's degree in Computer Science from the   University of Buffalo, Baidu co-founder and CEO Robin Li worked   at Dow Jones & Co.'s IDD Information Services and search   company Infoseek in the  1990s.At IDD, Li developed the software for the online version ofThe Wall Street Journaland invented his patented Rankdex site-scoring algorithm for    SEO rankings -- which currently powers Baidu's search   engine. At Infoseek, Li created the image search function, which   was subsequently used inDisney's Go.com network. After spending over five years at those two   companies, Li returned to China and co-founded Baidu with   investor Eric Xu in early 2000.2. Baidu is developing driverless carsLike Google, Baidu believes that autonomous electric cars   would be a natural extension of its data mining ecosystem. The   company started testing out driverless cars on public roads in   late 2015, and formed a driverless tech research center in   Silicon Valley last April.Image source: Getty Images.Baidu is powering these vehicles with a combination ofNVIDIA's automotive chips, HERE Maps, and its own AI algorithms. It's   currently outsourcing production of these vehicles to Chinese   automakers, and has declared that it will launch an autonomous   shuttle bus  by 2018.3. It's beefing up its AI effortsFor search engines like Baidu and Google, AI plays a key role   in recognizing images, analyzing search patterns, and deciding   what types of targeted ads will appeal to users. That's why Baidu   hired a lot of top talent in AI -- its chief scientist Andrew Ng   previously helmed the Google Brain AI project, and its new   augmented reality chief Qi Lu was previously an AI specialist atMicrosoft.Baidu hasn't been shy about challenging Google in the AI arms   race. In January, it pitted its AI program against Google's   AlphaGo AI in  a series of facial and voice recognition   tests in a live TV broadcast.4. Baidu owns a small stake in Didi ChuxingBaidu previously invested in Uber's Chinese division, but Uber   eventually retreated from the market due to tough competition --   especially from market leader Didi Chuxing. Uber sold its Chinese   business to Didi last August, but retained a 17.7% stake in the   new subsidiary. Baidu and Uber China's other  shareholders   received a 2.3% stake.That stake is small, but Baidu could boost it and more tightly   integrate Didi's services into its O2O (online-to-offline)   ecosystem. Didi could also play a key role in automating Baidu's   driverless cars.5. It owns a big part of CtripBaidu owns a 25% stake inCtrip(NASDAQ: CTRP) , the largest online travel agency (OTA) in China.   For years, Ctrip was engaged in a price war with its primary   competitorQunar(NASDAQ: QUNR) , which crushed both companies' margins.Baidu owned a 45% stake in Qunar, but it swapped that stake   for  a 25% stake in Ctrip in 2015 -- which effectively   merged the two companies and ended the price war. That move also   tethered Ctrip's services more tightly to Baidu's growing O2O   ecosystem.6. Baidu also sells smart bikesIn late 2014, Baidu introduced DuBike, a bike equipped with a   wide array of health and motion sensors which sync to a mobile   app. It also features on-board navigation signals, which let   riders follow directions without glancing at their phones, and   lets riders share their routes with friends. To top it off, the   entire system is powered by a rider's kinetic energy -- so the   bike never needs to be recharged.Baidu's DuBike. Image source: Baidu.The key takeawayThe heart of Baidu's business is still search-based   advertising, but that could gradually change as its efforts in   driverless cars, AI, its O2O ecosystem, and even smart bikes pay   off. Therefore, investors should keep an eye on these adjacent   efforts as the company trades blows with other tech titans --   likeTencentandAlibaba-- over the next few years.10 stocks we like better than BaiduWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Should I Buy BlackBerry Ltd (BBRY)? 3 Pros, 3 Cons;3/6/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe collapse ofBlackBerry Ltd(NASDAQ:BBRY) has been stunning. But in the tech world, such things do happen with regularity.makeArticleAd();Source:WEi WEi via FlickrYet BBRY stock is still far from dead. Hey, if anything, it's amazing that the company has been able to recover from having to deal with the onslaught of mega operators likeApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) andSamsung(OTCMKTS:SSNLF). Let's face it, evenMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) couldn't put up successful fight. This was certainly a major reason why CEO Steve Ballmer stepped aside.But survival is not enough, of course. So it should be no surprise that - for the past five years - BBRY stock is off about 50%.OK then, what about the future? Might there be a turnaround? Well, right now, it may seem kind of tough to imagine. But then again, this was the sentiment for say,Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMD), a year ago, right?Definitely.7 Telecom Stocks That Are High-Yield Money TrapsSo to gauge the potential opportunity of BlackBerry stock, let's take a look at three pros and cons:3 Pros On BBRY StockLeadership: The CEO of BBRY, John Chen, is a proven veteran in the tech industry. Back in 1997, he took the helm ofSybase, which was struggling againstOracle Corporation(NYSE:ORCL). But he restructured the operations and redirected the company towards enterprise mobility and commerce. He would ultimately sell Sybase toSAP SE (ADR)(NYSE:SAP) for a hefty $5.8 billion.Yet Chen also has strongtechnical chops. Consider that he has a master's in electrical engineering from California Institute of Technology. He also got his first job as an engineer withBurroughsin 1979.Reinvention: Transitioning a company from hardware to software is no easy feat. But Chen has definitely made lots of progress with this strategy. In the latest quarter, the revenues from Software & Services came to roughly55% of the total. Oh, and about 80% was recurring. In all, there were over 3,000 enterprise customer orders in the quarter.For Chen, he has made some savvy acquisitions, such as forEncription,Good TechnologyandAtHoc. And another important part of the strategy has been to outsource phone development. This has meant fewer distractions as well as the opportunity to pick-up high-margin licensing revenues.Something else: Chen has done a good job in leveraging some of the long-time core technology assets. An example of this is BlackBerry Secure, which is a full-blown suite of mobile enterprise apps.Long-Term Opportunities: BBRY is trying to position itself to get a share of the embedded technology market, which is seeing tremendous growth from the auto sector. Note that the company has BlackBerry QNX, which is a software development platform that provides top-notch security features and has been awarded the ISO 26262 ASIL D certification for cars. The system is optimized to support leading vendors likeNvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA),Intel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) and AMD.As a testament to the advantages of QNX, BBRY recently signed an agreement withFord Motor Company(NYSE:F) to cover more car models.3 Cons On BBRY StockBrand Issues: Back in 2007, BBRY was the global leader in the fast-growing smartphone market. But the iPhone would quickly end this dominance. What's more, BBRY made plenty of blunders, such as in terms of awful launches.The result is that the BlackBerry brand is fairly tarnished. Granted, this many not seem to matter as much since the company has moved away from the consumer market. However, the brand could still be a problem with business customers as well. Why use technology from a company that seems to have a dicey future?Competition: It's intense. When it comes to the security market, there are many players that have great offerings likeFortinet Inc(NASDAQ:FTNT),Palo Alto Networks Inc(NYSE:PANW) andCheck Point Software Technologies Ltd.(NASDAQ:CHKP).But of course, the market for enterprise mobility solutions also has many tough operators. Just some includeVMware, Inc.(NYSE:VMW), MSFT,International Business Machines Corp.(NYSE:IBM) and SAP.And finally, BBRY's offerings in the messaging category also must fight against stiff competition, such as withFacebook Inc's(NASDAQ:FB) WhatsApp, MSFT's Skype, AAPL's iMessage and even Snap Inc's(NYSE:SNAP) Snapchat.M&A: For the most part, BBRY seems to be good buyout bait. The company's cost structure has been streamlined, there are strong technology assets and a large customer base.Yet According toInvestorPlace.com's Richard Saintvilus: ""It has become clear that Chen - who was brought in to build BlackBerry into an M&A target - has taken this company as far as he can take it. Despite all of the boasting the company has done about its superior security capabilities, BBRY stock has had no M&A suitors, suggesting companies likeCisco Systems, Inc.(NASDAQ:CSCO), Oracle Corporation and other enterprise-focused companies with which BlackBerry has often been linked, don't care.""Bottom Line On BBRY StockAgain, Chen has done a great job. Let's face it, BBRY was a complete mess when he came on board in late 2013.Use Micron Technology, Inc. (MU) Stock to Unlock Free ProfitsHe wasted little time with cost cutting and outsourcing of the phone business. More importantly, he has invested in areas like security, embedded systems and even the Internet of Things (IoT).However, despite all this, the fact remains that progress has been grudging. If anything, it will probably still take some time - say a year or so - for the changes to have a real impact. In other words, for those looking at BBRY stock, it's probably best not to rush to buy it right now.Tom Taulli runs the InvestorPlace blogIPO Playbookand is the author of various books, includingTaxes 2017: Saving A Bundle.Follow him on Twitter at@ttaulli.

BP Plc (ADR) (BP) Stock’s Dividend Is a Gusher for Income Investors;3/6/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsInvestors are having a tough time believingBP Plc (ADR)(NYSE:BP) will sustain its generous dividend, which yields 7% currently. The vertically integrated oil and gas company's future cash flow depends on the price of oil.makeArticleAd();Source:Mike Mozart via FlickrLast month, on Feb. 7, BP's fourth-quarter results were hardly inspiring. Trading closer to its yearly low, chances are good the stock found some support at current levels.BP Stock's Q4 Earnings Were UninspiringBP reported earnings of $400 million, missing expectations by a wide margin. Since no one really knows where oil prices will head next, BP stock will likely trade in a range of between $33 and $38 a share. Looking at the charts, the price hovered at $33 nearly half a dozen times in the last year. The stock peaked at $38 at the start of 2017.For now, the stock's dividend is safe. Management has no intention of cutting the quarterly dividend despite cash flow from operations falling over 40% from last year. It still needs oil at around $60 a barrel for cash flow to cover dividends and spending requirements.7 Telecom Stocks That Are High-Yield Money TrapsSince January, oil prices hovered in the $53 per barrel range. It closed recently at $53.75 per barrel. With the summer driving season just months away, energy markets are showing no real signs of a breakout.Buying the DipInvestors with a five-to-10-year time horizon may probably buy BP shares now and have a positive return. Though the solar energy sector is important, it is only a small part of energy supply.First Solar, Inc.(NASDAQ:FSLR) is adjusting its business and preparing for lower solar panel prices. The excess oil supply will adjust in time. Nations will cut back output in the years ahead to prop up prices. Eventually, the energy prices will move up.It is not the only firm that is underperforming.Exxon Mobil Corporation(NYSE:XOM) ""double-bottomed"" between October and November 2016, and again last month. Its share pay a dividend of 3.6 percent. Yet BP stock is cheaper at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 12.5x, compared to 17x with XOM.Cash Flow Forecast for BPBP'sforecaston cash flow in the next five years is positive. The company expects upstream cash flow of between $13 billion - $14 billion. Downstream will add up to $10 billion. By spending less on exploration, the company is betting oil prices will go up. It will need demand to go up for that to happen.Speaking of clean energy from solar power, BP announced on March 1, that it would buy the upstream renewable natural gas business fromClean Energy FuelsCorp(NASDAQ:CLNE). The investment, which gives BP supply of biomethane, BP's diversification from oil is promising. It improves the company's image and gives it other sources of revenue outside of its core business.Don't Worry About Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock Just YetInvestors should get some exposure in the energy sector. BP is a suitable company for income investors. Oil prices are not expected to fall, and if they do, BP still has room to trim its dividend.Still, it is unlikely that oil prices will worsen. Globally, economic activity is picking up and the U.S. is about to embark on infrastructure spending. This should lead to higher demand in the energy market.As of this writing, Chris Lau owns shares of BP stock.More From InvestorPlaceThe 7 Best ETFs for Market-Beating Returns5 Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy in MarchThe postBP Plc (ADR) (BP) Stock's Dividend Is a Gusher for Income Investorsappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Don’t Worry About Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock Just Yet;3/6/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsInvestors receive little insight charting stock prices and deciphering patterns, but with theMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) ""double top"" in February, Microsoft stock holders should take notice.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockFor those that don't know,a double topis a price formation that could possibly signal the end of a bull market. It is essentially a rise and a drop followed by yet another rise and subsequent drop.At around $64.20 a share, a dividend yielding just 2.43% and a price-earnings of 30, what justifies the valuation of Microsoft stock?Investors love the cash that Microsoft generates every quarter. In Microsoft's second quarter, the company reported phenomenal revenue growth from Azure and $7.4 billion from the productivity and business processes division.The only sore spot for Microsoft stock was the personal computing unit. Although revenue of $11.8 billion is impressive, it dropped 5% from last year. LinkedIn added revenue of $228 million, but cost MSFT $100 million in net income.Subscription GrowthOffice 365 fueled Microsoft's subscription revenue growth. CEO Satya Nadella said it will focus on growing the licensing level for programs like SharePoint with PowerApps and Flow. That way, recurring value grows, usage improves and customer renewalscontinue:""First, even for the customers who are already on Office 365 at any given licensing level, we focus quite a bit on their increased usage and intensity. So for example, one of the comments I made in my remarks was, for example, SharePoint with PowerApps and Flow. That's to us to the best way for us to keep having that recurring value.""Profiting From LinkedInThe negative earnings from LinkedIn may reverse, eventually. Microsoft sees the unit as a strategic asset in building a network of professionals. As revenue grows, the customer base grows. When the time is right, MSFT will have cloud products and productivity software it may sell to the bigger user base.5 Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy in MarchLog in to LinkedIn and you will notice the site received a complete redesign. It is confusing. Pages load slowly and users will not know how to navigate as easily as they did before.No Smartphone, No ProblemEnthusiasm for Azure cloud services and Office 365 justifies MSFT's high valuations, but Microsoft still has no real market share in smartphones. Its development of Office apps on devices may keep the company relevant in the mobile space. Having a firmer control on the hardware developments would be more ideal.By pushing Windows Phone operating system, Microsoft is not winning over users. That will lead to a further drop in smartphone sales. Innovation in the hardware for Windows phones will slow as a result.Eventually, the company will cede the market toApple Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone andAlphabet Inc's(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Android phones. Google, for its part, is fully embracing Android devices through the development of the Pixel device.Bottom Line on Microsoft StockNintendo Co.'sOTCMKTS:NTDOY) release of the Switch console on March 3 is notable for the Japanese company. The Wii U console resulted in Nintendo losing market share. Switch, however, is not expected to take much market share from Microsoft's Xbox One console. Xbox Live had more than55 million active users, up 15% from last year.UBS Says Netflix, Inc. (NFLX) Stock Has 26% UpsideIt added $1 billion in revenue for the quarter, up 17% from last year. At that phenomenal rate of growth as a function of revenue growth,Sony Corporation's(NYSE:SNE) market share dominance with the PS4 is not that impressive.Azure is one of the few bright spots of spectacular growth for Microsoft. Its other businesses, however, are running well. The 30 times P/E will shrink if earnings growth outpaces expectations and Microsoft stock's double top is barely a concern. That said, chances are good MSFT's stock will continue moving higher.As of this writing, Chris Lau did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace7 Earnings Losers to Pick Up off the Floor4 Retail Stocks That Are Toxic Right NowThe postDon't Worry About Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock Just Yetappeared first onInvestorPlace."

These Catalysts Will Give the Fintech Industry Its Next Leg Up;3/6/2017;"The financial technologies industry has been one of the few breakout markets over the last 10 years. One of the driving forces behind its growth and quick adoption has been the shift to mobile payments.PayPal Holdings Inc.(PYPL) is still the market leader, which is largely due to its web platform services rather than its mobile wallet apps.In fact, there is a huge debate regarding the penetration of mobile payments amongst consumers as some still question the security of their personal information. Even revolutionary mobile wallets such asApple(AAPL) Pay are yet to gain traction as previously predicted, despite employing the use of fingerprint technology to execute transactions.As such, it appears the initial hype about the industry being revolutionary in the financial payments market has recently stalled.makeArticleAd();Nonetheless, this industry could yet be set for the next leg up thanks to an array of catalysts that seem to be building up behind the scenes. The fintech industry is now more than just about payments. It is stretching its wings to credit, the stock market and traditional banking institutions. These could hold the key to its growth and development over the next few years.Credit and insuranceThis area of the fintech industry is still at the early stages of development with just a few players embracing the paradigm shift in the market. Right now, you can easily get asset finance loans, insurance premium financing and payday loans from various online platforms, including mobile devices and web portals.For instance, Rob Sinclair Equipment is an Australia-based revolutionary asset finance platform that specializes in financing the purchase of equipment in the transport industry. According to the company, the segmentation of the fintech industry could be the key to boosting growth at the consumer level. Rob Sinclair notes more customers are showing the willingness to embrace various aspects of the industry when the companies they deal with specialize in a few segments rather than offering generalized products.In addition, the introduction of mobile applications has opened the doors for financial services companies to bring their products closer to their customers. While mobile wallets are the most popular in that respect, credit and insurance providers are beginning to join in on the action. Most companies are coming in to act as a link between mainstream banking institutions and consumers. With the help of mobile applications, customers can now apply for loans while on the move and get approval within minutes.Blockchain and algorithmic tradingThe stock market is pretty much the leading option when it comes to investing. A few things, however, have changed over the last decade or so. Investors are adapting to new methods of participating in the market and even some of the top hedge funds have started to embrace the change.Algorithmic trading is slowly becoming a norm amongst investors, but a few tweaks still need to be made in order to make it a widely accepted method of trading. Some countries have stiff regulations when it comes to high-frequency trading while security threats still hover for online traders.With many countries now realizing the changes that have been taking place in the stock market over the last few years, however, a more accommodative regulatory framework could be in the making. Additionally, with network technologies such as blockchain already proving reliable, the security threat posed to online traders could be trimmed to the bare minimum.Blockchain is a network infrastructure that has been growing in popularity over the last few years due to the success of various applications such as bitcoin, which run on the network. In fact, giant technology companies likeIBM(IBM) andMicrosoft(MSFT) have already intensified their interest in blockchain technology, which could signal a show of reliability and boost adoption.ConclusionIn summary, while the more popular segments of the fintech industry (online payments led by PayPal and mobile wallets led by Apple Pay) continue to gain traction with the growing adoption of mobile banking, there are a few under the radar business segments in this industry that could trigger the next leg up.The main challenge has been to get customers to feel at ease about linking personal data to some of these technologies, but, as noted, the level of reliability could be boosted when businesses focus on specific segments rather than offering blanket services. Technologies such as blockchain could also play a pivotal role in taking the fintech industry to the next level.Disclosure: I have no position in any stock mentioned in this article.Start afree 7-day trial of Premium Membershipto GuruFocus.Premium MembersThis article first appeared onGuruFocus."

Better Buy: Amazon.com, Inc. vs. Microsoft;3/6/2017;"They're two of the five largest publicly traded companies in   the world. They're technology giants that are increasingly   competing against one another in multibillion-dollar growth   industries such as cloud computing and artificial intelligence.   They'reAmazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) andMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) .And they're vastly different companies in terms of their core   operational focuses, their recent histories, and their cultures.   So which is the better buy today? Let's examine Amazon.com   and Microsoft through three analytical lenses, to determine which   tech stalwart represents the better stock to buy today.Financial fortitudeThough both companies are financial behemoths, Microsoft beats   Amazon in this comparison of financial fortitude. Here's a quick   summary of several important liquidity and solvency measures for   each company.makeArticleAd();CompanyCash and InvestmentsDebtCash From OperationsCurrent RatioMicrosoft$122.7 billion$84.9 billion$36.7 billion2.1Amazon.com$25.9 billion$7.7 billion$16.4 billion1.0Data sources: Amazon.com and Microsoft investor relations,   Yahoo! Finance.Microsoft and Amazon are in fine financial shape. However,   even though Microsoft carries more debt than Amazon, it earns a   win in this category by beating the world's largest e-commerce   provider in three categories. Plus, only $600 million of   Microsoft's borrowings will come due this calendar   year.  The overwhelming majority of Microsoft's debt   comes due after 2020, and then at very low interest rates. Given   the company's cash flow generation capabilities, servicing that   debt should be no issue for Microsoft.It also bears noting that Microsoft, likeApple, keeps the bulk of its cash holdings overseas to shield it from   repatriation taxes. In its most recent 10-Q, the company didn't   disclose how much cash lies offshore, but its annual 10-K filing   showed that it kept approximately 96% overseas. But since it   generates plenty of operating cash flow to fund its domestic and   international operations, this is really a non-issue for   investors.Winner: Microsoft.Durable competitive advantagesMicrosoft and Amazon.com each enjoy competitive advantages,   albeit of different sorts. Amazon's primary moats are its scale   and risk-taking culture. At this point, Microsoft's competitive   insulation seems more structural and historic. Let's unpack each   of those a bit more.Amazon generates the bulk of its sales from its core   e-commerce operations, accounting for 91% of revenue in   2016. As the world's largest e-commerce site by revenue,   Amazon has an incredible scale that allows it to consistently   offer low prices. More impressive still, Amazon's unique ability   to turn its own platform into sources of revenue -- think Amazon   Web Services,Fulfillment by Amazon, third-party ads on Amazon.com, and so on -- allows it to charge   the lowest prices possible on its e-commerce site, which in turn   attracts more customers. This self-regenerating business   philosophy is best summarized in the idea of theFlywheel Effect, which is at the core of Amazon's strategy and touches on its   unique culture.Image Source: Amazon.comTo create a culture that could invent profit centers to buoy   its low- or even negative-margin e-commerce sales, Amazon CEO   Jeff Bezos and his team needed to create a culture where   risk-taking and unconventional thinking were the norm. Bezos   summarized risk-taking's foundational place in Amazon's culture   in the 2015 annual letter:A word about corporate cultures: For better or for worse,     they are enduring, stable, hard to change. ... One area where I     think we are especially distinctive is failure. I believe we     are the best place in the world to fail (we have plenty of     practice!), and failure and invention are inseparable     twins.Without its unique corporate mindset, Amazon never would have   had the audaciousness and vision to launch many of its most   important initiatives, making its culture arguably its most   important asset and source of enduring competitive advantage.Microsoft's source of competitive advantage, on the other   hand, can be summarized in one word: ""Office."" It remains   Microsoft's financial heart and soul and is the largest revenue   source at the company, singlehandedly accounting for $23.5   billion, or 27%, of Microsoft's $85.3 billion in sales in fiscal   2016.CEO Satya Nadella's 2015-16 reorganization of Microsoft's   operations created three new reporting segments: productivity and   business processes (PBP), intelligent cloud, and more personal   computing. PBP houses the consumer and commercial Office   operations, as well as Microsoft's Dynamics CRM platform. The   entire segment generated $26.5 billion of Microsoft's total   sales, so we know, using the Office revenue figure, that Office   drives the segment's performance.Its importance comes into greater focus when looking at   Microsoft's operating-profit breakdown. PBP -- again, mostly   Office -- generated $12.4 billion, or 62%, of Microsoft's   $20.1 billion in fiscal 2016 operating income, making it the   financial bellwether that guides Microsoft's financial   performance.Other segments, particularly Intelligent Cloud, have become   increasingly important pieces of Microsoft's financial footprint   as well. However, Microsoft's core competitive advantage still   lies in the fact that Word, Excel, and PowerPoint make up the   default productivity software for the majority of world's   computer-using population, and that's a source of tremendous   advantage -- and profit -- for the company.Winner: Tie.ValuationComparing the valuations of Microsoft and Amazon isn't the   simplest exercise, given their different growth profiles. With   that in mind, here are three of the most commonly used valuation   metrics for each company.CompanyP/EForward P/EEV/EBITDAMicrosoft30.219.716.8Amazon.com173.766.134.1EV = ENTERPRISE VALUE. EBITDA = EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST,   TAXES, DEPRECIATION, AND AMORTIZATION. Data source: Yahoo!   Finance.Here we get a great comparison of two investing styles --   growth versus value. Neither comes out ahead here. More   conservative investors who prefer to own stocks with something of   a margin of safety will probably be drawn to Microsoft, with its   more conservative valuation and 2.3% dividend yield. Of   course, those same investors have always argued that Amazon is   overvalued, even as the company's stock ascends ever higher.From the perspective of a long-term investor, I believe   Amazon's ability to grow at above-average rates for years, if not   decades to come, will enable it to grow into and beyond its   current valuation. Microsoft's main issue, meanwhile, remains its   growth outlook.This analysis is somewhat subjective. More risk-averse   investors, particularly those nearing retirement, might want to   stay away from Amazon stock. However, for those with the ability   to buy and hold a company for a decade or more, I like Amazon   despite its aggressive valuation today.Winner: Tie.And the winner is... Amazon, by a noseBoth Amazon and Microsoft offer investors attractive   investment opportunities, in very different ways. As I mentioned,   Microsoft is probably a better option for more risk-averse   investors. It's a stable, mature company and should derive the   bulk of its financial returns from growing profits and EPS,   rather than through rapidly expanding its top line. Amazon's   growth trajectory, meanwhile, is generational, as it looks to   rewrite the rules of the global retail industry. In the end,   Amazon strikes me as the better stock for long-term investors to   buy today.10 stocks we like better than MicrosoftWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

IBM to Commercialize Quantum Computing Using Cloud Platform;3/6/2017;"International Business Machines CorporationIBMrecently announced plans to introduce quantum computing systems and services in the commercial space under the brand name ""IBM Q"". The company will leverage its IBM Cloud platform to deliver these systems and services.We note that this is an industry-first initiative undertaken by the technology giant and could revolutionize the way computing is being carried out in the present context.International Business Machines Corporation Price and   ConsensusInternational Business Machines Corporation Price   and Consensus|International Business Machines Corporation QuoteFilling in the Market GapCognitive systems such as IBM Watson run on classical computers and are capable of finding patterns and insights by deciphering huge amount of data. However, in the absence of any such recognizable patterns, these systems are not of much use.This is where quantum computers come into play as they are capable of providing solutions to problems where recognizable patterns don't exist.Quantum computing has its applications in many fields such as artificial intelligence, financial services, cloud security, drug discovery and supply chain and logistics.What Does This Mean for IBM?As per a Market Research Media report, worldwide spending on quantum computing is estimated to reach $5 billion by 2020. Not surprisingly then, competition in the sector is intensifying, with the presence of major players such as MicrosoftMSFT, GoogleGOOGL, Intel, D-Wave Systems, Hewlett Packard and Lockheed Martin.However, IBM with its industry-first initiatives looks poised to carve a niche in this segment.Stock Performance OverviewShares of IBM have underperformed the ZacksComputer - Integrated Systemsindustry over the last one year. While the industry gained 33.8%, the stock appreciated 28.4%.The underperformance of the stock could be due to weakness in the company's traditional businesses and shift toward the cloud that is keeping margins under pressure.  However, we believe that IBM's endeavor in the rapidly growing quantum computing field along with its strategic initiatives will help the stock rebound in 2017.Zacks Rank and Key PickAt present, IBM carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the broader technology space is Digi International Inc.DGII, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

What Investors Missed in the Market This Week;3/4/2017;"More evidence that the economy continued to chug along came   this week when the Institute for Supply Management said its   non-manufacturing index jumped 110 basis points from January to   February, and reached 57.6%. For context, any rating above 50%   means more businesses are expanding. The 57.6% rating was the   highest since October 2015, and the expansion of 16 of the 18   sectors was the highest number since the middle of 2014.In broader news, the S&P 500 finished with its   sixth-consecutive weekly gain, and the Dow tallied its   fourth-consecutive weekly gain. All that aside, there were some   major headlines and moves in the markets this week. Let's hit   some highlights.A successful IPOImage source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();If you're an investor, or just casually follow the markets,   chances are you heard aboutSnap Inc.'s(NYSE: SNAP) successful IPO on Thursday. The company announced   a day prior to the IPO that it would sell 200 million shares for   $17 per share, which was the largest U.S. IPO since 2014.   Although the company has never turned a profit, investors jumped   on board the IPO wagon, sending its shares up 44%, to $24.48,   when shares hit the market on Thursday.The IPO made a lot of people rich, including Snap CEO Evan   Spiegel, who sold at least $272 million worth of shares and still   owns roughly $3.6 billion, according to MarketWatch. Snap's IPO   raised almost $2.5 billion for the parent company and another $1   billion for the founders and early investors.But now the real work begins, because Snap just as easily   could go the way of Twitter, which declined consistently after   its IPO, rather than Facebook, which became a tech juggernaut in   the years following its IPO. Snap has roughly 158 million users   -- mostly between the ages of 18 and 24 -- and is growing.Now, it's just a matter of if and when Snap can better   monetize its growing user base consistently. This is a task much   easier said than done -- just ask Twitter.Bad opticsEvery kiss begins with Kay, but that brand image might not be   what consumers and investors think of first forSignet Jewelers Ltd(NYSE: SIG) , the owner of Kay Jeweler and Jared, among others.   TheWashington Postreported that hundreds of former employees claimed the company's   CEO and other management members allowed a corporate culture of   sexual harassment and discrimination.The attorneys were only granted permission to release the   statements publicly Sunday, and the headlines sent shares of   Signet Jewelers stock down roughly 13% during intra-day trading   on Tuesday. No matter how you slice the issue, it's bad for   the jewelry company, especially in today's easily offended and   social-media-intensive world.Going forward, a class-action hearing is scheduled for early   next year, when witnesses will be called to testify before an   arbitration judge for the first time. Currently, Signet Jewelers   trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of eight, per   Morningstar.com estimates, which could tempt value investors. If   you find yourself in that camp, buyer beware -- this will be   something to watch over the next couple of years.An aging dinosaurShares of video game retailerGameStop(NYSE: GME) received yet another reminder that its business is   going to be an uphill battle as more consumers opt to purchase   video games online. On Tuesday,Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) announced a subscription service for Xbox One that   will give full access to over 100 older video games.The service, named Xbox Game Pass, gives consumers another way   to pass the GameStop brick-and-mortar stores, and could easily   create a headwind for the game company's sales of both new and   used video games. Investors were quick to react to Microsoft's   announcement and sent GameStop shares quickly down 10% during   intra-day trading.In my opinion, GameStop is an aging dinosaur that looks to be   heading the way of Blockbuster in an increasingly digital world.   The company's top and bottom lines have been stagnant since 2010.   Without a growth story, in addition to an increasingly digital   world, there doesn't seem to be much value left in owning shares.   So it's no surprise that the company trades at a paltry 6.7 times   forward earnings, per Morningstar.com estimates.10 stocks we like better than Snap Inc.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Cisco (CSCO) Expands Its IoT Offerings Thanks to Jasper;3/3/2017;"Cisco Systems Inc.'sCSCOstock has been a consistent performer in the last 12 months. While the ZacksComputer - Networkingindustry gained 27.6%, shares of this technology giant recorded marginally better returns of 27.7%. This trend can primarily be attributed to improving revenues from subscription services as well as robust demand in the telecom sector.Meanwhile, the company is focusing on expanding its Internet of Things (IoT) division, as per a recent announcement at the Mobile World Congress (MWC), held in Barcelona.Based on its acquisition of Jasper Technologies in Mar 2016 Cisco is aiming at becoming a major IoT platform provider going forward.Notably, the platform has emerged as one of the biggest monetization assets for Cisco given the burgeoning demand for IoT.At MWC, Cisco announced that itwill now provide support for narrowband IoT low-power wide-area network (LPWAN), which has applications in the industrial IoT space. Moreover, the company inked a partnership with car-maker Honda and Bright Box, a European connected-car platform which will enable Jasper to breath life into Bright Box's infotainment centers that come as a standard fitting in many of Honda's European car models. It was also announced at the event that Cisco will collaborate with Samsung and Jupl (a health data startup) to develop a wearable device targeted at the elderly for health monitoring purposes.What Does this Mean for Cisco?As of today, on the verge of one year completion, Cisco's IoT unit has witnessed a whopping surge of 157% in enterprise customer additions, 135% increase in the number of devices that are being managed and a 42% advance in adoptions for Jasper's Control Center product.As per an IDC report, the IoT market is estimated to reach a massive $1.7 trillion by 2020 with nearly 30 billion connected ""things."" Given the huge potential the sector has to offer, the time is ripe to carve a niche and that's exactly what Cisco is doing right now.Not surprisingly then, there is stiff competition in the space with the presence of major players such as Alphabet's GoogleGOOGL, MicrosoftMSFT, IBM, Intel, Siemens and AT&T.However, with these announcements, Cisco looks poised to take on the competition head on which augurs well for the company in the long run.Cisco Systems, Inc.

Videogame Stock Roundup: Nintendo's Switch Release, Facebook Rift Price Cut, Sony PS VR's Record Sales & More;3/3/2017;"There were quite a few developments in the video game space last week. The Japanese giant NintendoNTDOY, released it much anticipated console, Switch amid much fanfare. Also, Facebook IncFBslashed price of its VR headset, Rift by $100 while Sony Corp'sSNEPS VR breaks sales records.Recap of the Developments1. Nintendo's Switch had a ""smooth debut,"" reported Bloomberg. According to the report, the units were soon outsold following the release ""signaling Nintendo is on track to reach its goal of shipping 2 million units by the end of the month.""Switch, priced at $300, combines the functionalities of both conventional consoles and handheld devices. Switch is designed to attract casual gamers who are increasingly using mobile. Nintendo, after staying away from mobile gaming for long has now become highly focused on mobile games. Last year's smash hit Pokémon Go gave it the much needed impetus.The new Zelda game which has a Metacritic rating of 98 out of 100 should boost Switch sales. Nintendo needs a hit in the form of Switch, following the debacle of its last console Wii U. However, a hefty price and apparent lack of any ground-breaking/differentiating features from the consoles that are available in the markets right now could cost the company heavily. Nintendo carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).2. Facebook has slashed the price of its VR headset Rift and Oculus Touch Motion controllers by $100 each. The step is widely viewed as a measure to boost sales. FB chief Mark Zuckerberg earlier commented that he expects Rift to sell about 50 to 100 million units over the next 10 years. However, Bloomberg quoting SuperData Research, reports that only 350K units were sold last year. Price has been a major deterrent for Rift having failed to gain a mass adoption. Rift was originally priced at $599, much higher than Sony's PS VR.Facebook had acquired Oculus for $2 billion in 2014. With Oculus, the company is trying to fuel the company's ambitious AR/VR efforts. Oculus has long been labeled as a multibillion dollar opportunity along with Facebook's other subsidiaries like Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp. Facebook carries a Zacks Rank #3.3. While Facebook is trying to boost sales of Rift, Sony's PS VR witnessedunprecedented salessince its release in October 2016. As on Feb 19, 2017, Sony Interactive Entertainment (SIE), the gaming division of the company, reported that it had sold 915,000 PS VR units in the four months following its launch.It was prudent on part of Sony to capitalize on its powerful installed base of over 53.4 million PS4 customers to drive VR sales. Plus, the company's decision to price headset at just $399 was considered a smart ploy as it offered the device for a discount of over $200 compared to other headsets available in the market. Sony carries a Zacks Rank #3. You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy)   stocks here.4. Meanwhile, Microsoft Corp (MSFT) launched a subscription based gaming service, Xbox Game Pass. Reportedly, with Xbox Game Pass, users can ""download unlimited games"" from Xbox One and Xbox 360 games roster for a subscription of $9.99 per month. Though similar to Netflix Inc's (NFLX) streaming service, Xbox game pass differs a lot from Netflix. Per media reports, users are required to download games rather than stream. This alleviates the concerns of having a strong bandwidth and internet connectivity all the time.Microsoft carries a Zacks Rank #3.However, the news causedshares of GameStop(GME) to fall as the Game Pass emerges a threat to its business. Analysts observe that GameStop is a video games retailer which buys and sells video games both new and used. However, with most new games available for download, GameStop's business thrives on selling used games. With Xbox Pass even this is highly at risk. At present, GameStop carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).PerformanceThe following table shows the price movement of the major video game companies over both the past five trading days as well as the last six months:CompanyLast 5 DaysLast 6 MonthsATVI2.98%9.07%EA-0.33%4.25%GLUU-7.28%-17.67%MSFT-0.94%10.99%NTES-3.21%34.65%TTWO-3.03%29.49%ZNGA2.24%0.74%Over the last five trading sessions, Glu Mobile Inc.GLUUwas down 7.28% whereas Activision BlizzardATVIwas up 2.98%.Computer and Technology Sector 5YR % ReturnComputer and Technology Sector 5YR % ReturnOver the last six-month period, NetEaseNTESsurged the most (34.35%). Recently, NetEase reported solid fourth-quarter 2016 results. The increasing popularity of mobile-based games and the strength of PC games (licensed & self-developed) continue to keep investors interested in the stock. NetEase's online gaming revenues grew 62% in the quarter. Also, NetEase has announced a new $1 billion buyback program for its ADRs over a one-year time frame.Glu was down 17.67% over the same time frame owingto underperformance of most of its releases. To improve its performance, Glu announced that it has inked a deal with MLB and Kris Bryant and many more for releasing a new title under its Tap Sports Baseball franchise. The company brought on board, a video game industry veteran Nick Earl as the new CEO while Niccolo de Masiwill will now be the chairman of the company. It also acquired a majority stake in CrowdStar, which develops free-to-play mobile games. It recently acquired a mobile game developer, Plain Vanilla for $7.5 million.Want to learn more about video game stocks?

Inside Snapchat: The Biggest Tech IPO Since Facebook;3/3/2017;"Snap Inc.SNAP, parent company of Snapchat, recently made its historic market debut. It was the second-largest U.S.-based technology IPO ever, behind only FacebookFB, one of its key industry competitors no less.Snapchat is one of the most popular messaging and social media apps on the market today. It humbly began as a class project by former Stanford University students Evan Spiegel (now CEO), Reggie Brown, and Bobby Murphy. (For an inside look at Mr. Spiegel, check out this Zacks article:Can Snapchat's Evan Spiegel Be the Next Mark Zuckerberg?)Launched officially in 2012, Snapchat allows users to take photos, record videos, add text and drawings, and send them to a controlled list of recipients. These photos and videos disappear within 1-10 seconds-the amount is up to the sender-after the recipient views them.What Makes Snapchat So Popular?You know you're doing something right when huge tech corporations begincopyingall of your ideas. Giants like Facebook and MicrosoftMSFThave spent the better part of four years trying to emulate Snapchat, debuting new tools and features that are shamelessly similar to what the startup is known for.What makes the app so compelling?Ever since its debut, Snapchat has steadily climbed the social media ranks, having gained the top spot among teenagers over TwitterTWTR, Facebook, and even Instagram (though the photo-sharing app is swiftly closing ranks). According toMashable, who cited a Piper Jaffray study, 6,500 U.S. teens were polled ""to see what they felt was the most important social network, and Snapchat took 28% of votes. Instagram came in close-second with 27%, followed by Twitter and Facebook.""Over the last year or so, Snapchat has been launching new unique feature after new unique feature, introducing things like Snapchat Discover, expanding its video and picture filter library, and partnering with events like the Oscars, where the app let its users watch live behind-the-scenes footage of the red carpet and the actual show.Teenagers love Snapchat, and teenagers are a coveted demographic for any tech company. The study both demonstrates Snapchat's incredible ability in capturing this fickle group of people, as well as why teenagers prefer this kind of digital platform.Ephemeral EngagementSnapchat is a social, ephemeral experience that favors photos and videos over text-based media, and the company has made these qualities a priority in its development and business model. Engagement is not new for social media applications. In fact, it is very important to all social media companies, as engagement is the driving revenue factor, besides advertising. Snapchat, though, is approaching it in a completely different way.Harvard Business School (HBS) Professors Marco Iansiti and Karim Lakhanioffer an interesting perspectiveon this idea. In an introduction to the elective course ""Digital Innovation and Transformation"" presented in HBS's Digital Initiative, Iansiti and Lakhani argue that Snapchat is ""not just a messaging system, but also a social network, community, and an ad platform.""Most importantly, Snapchat is anephemeralsocial network, community, and ad platform. Their unique, yet increasingly popular application method is a major contributing factor to their success.Iansiti and Lakhani continue, arguing that ""Snapchat provides a window into this challenging question: what drives value creation and capture in today's digital economy?"" In other words, Snapchat offers a business model perfect for our current digitized economy, monetizing ephemerality in an innovative way.Advertising & VideoNot only is Snap monetizing ideas, but it is also attempting to make money off its intensely high user base-the company has roughly 100 million daily active users-by introducing transient advertisements that disappear after a set amount of time.This is a basic, yet clever, business move for the company. The combination of a large user base and high daily activity is a goldmine for advertisers. Snap recognizes this, and smartly charges an astounding $750,000 minimum for a day of advertising. By charging per day instead of the usual per click, the company is letting go of the typical internet advertising model.The price may be staggering for some, but because of Snapchat's huge, engaged audience, their early ad products have attracted big-name buyers like McDonald'sMCD, SamsungSSNLF, Macy'sM, and ComcastCMCSA-owned Universal Studios.Video is another medium that Snapchat is capitalizing off of. According to a recentBloombergreport, Snapchat is now getting around 10 billion video views a day, with more than a third from its ""Stories"" feature. This figure is impressive because Snapchat is mobile-only. In comparison, Facebook's last reported video count was 8 billion daily views, which includes both mobile and desktop traffic.The issue of what counts as a video, however, may be a potential problem for the app going forward. Snapchat's videos are only a few seconds long, and most of the videos disappear once they are viewed. The company will need to clarify what they see as a video view in order to accurately paint a convincing picture.Problems to ConsiderDespite all of the company's positive aspects, Snapchat does not come without controversy. Because of its ephemeral platform, Snapchat has been associated with sexting, a news topic that garners wide public attention whenever reported on. To some, the app is a perfect tool for sexting, as any inappropriate content quickly disappears.The company has also been caught in racial controversies. On last April 20, the unofficial marijuana holiday, Snapchat released a new face filter meant to make users look like late reggae legend Bob Marley. The filter adds a Marley-style hat, dreadlocks, and darkens users' skin town, which had some people dubbing the filter as a form of digital blackface.And also last year, Snapchat released a filter lens that caused users' faces to look like caricatures of Asian people, with shut eyes and rosy cheeks. Snapchat toleThe Vergethat ""the lens was inspired by anime, and was meant to be playful."" It was eventually taken down, and will not be put back into circulation.Snap also lost a number of executives after brief stays during its time as a startup. In 2014, the company lost Peter Magnusson, who was the VP of Engineering, after six months. And in 2015, revenue boss Mike Randall leaving after a short, seven-month stint, with COO Emily White and HR chief Sara Sperling departing that year as well. Shannon Petranoff, a former Paramount VP who joined Snapchat in March of 2015, returned back to Paramount that September, while Jill Hazelbaker, VP of communications and policy, left for Uber after a year at Snap.An IPO for the Ages?The hype surrounding Snap's IPO was, to put it bluntly, insane. The company originally priced its initial public offering at $17 per share, which came in above the expected range of $14 to $16 per share and valued Snap at $24 billion. However, because of such high demand, SNAP stock started trading on the NYSE at $24 a share, rising as high as $26.05 at one point during the day.More than 200 million shares, which was the entire size of the offering, changed hands over the course of the day and accounted for roughly 10% of the total volume of trading on the NYSE; Snap's IPO ended up being 12 times oversubscribed, meaning there were 12 times more orders than there were shares offered. Shares of Snap closed their first day of trading up 44% to $24.48 per share, boosting its market cap to roughly $33 billion.CEO Evan Spiegel has always recognized the importance of an IPO, andtoldRe/codeat its annual conference back in 2015 that ""[Snap] needs to IPO. We have a plan to do that."" He did not give details back then but stressed that ""an IPO is really important."" Now that the company has made that giant step, its eager investors are wondering what's next for the company.Since its launch, Snap has molded itself as a company for the digital age and technology-grounded economy, and huge corporations wanted in from the get-go. Back in 2013, the company caught the attention of both Facebook and Alphabet Inc.'sGOOGLGoogle division. They offered to acquire Snapchat for $3 billion and $4 billion, respectively. In a bold, but smart move, Snapchat turned down both offers, with attention from investors rising exponentially as a result from the decision.Snap's primary demographic, smart advertising strategy, and ephemeral business model made the company quite the IPO catch. Despite having made no money yet-Snap lost $514.6 million in 2016, and warns that it ""may never achieve or maintain profitability,"" according to its IPO prospectus-these things, plus its ""cool factor,"" lured investors in droves, marking an IPO for the ages.Interested in the other top stories of the week?

Nokia Corp (ADR) (NOK) Hopes Old Phone Revival Can Help NOK Stock;3/3/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe high-tech world is still buzzing afterNokia Corp (ADR)(NYSE:NOK) andBlackBerry Ltd(NASDAQ:BBRY) showed off new handsets at last weekend's Mobile World Conference. However, I'm not sure nostalgia for candy bar phones and keyboard PDAs draws the right kind of attention to either company.makeArticleAd();Source:Open Grid Scheduler / Grid Engine via Flickr (Modified)For one, NOK never really left the ""dumb"" end of the phone market behind, so the company's grand ""return"" with a new version of its near-indestructible 3310 handset - popular in 2001 at a price around $120 - is only a shock to people who stopped paying attention, which they did for a reason.Granted, the feature phones that NOK recently pulled back out ofMicrosoft Corporation's(NASDAQ:MSFT) orbit accounted for 9% of the category last year, but that No. 2 share behindSamsung Electronic(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) only added up to 35 million handsets, or at best 2% of the global phone market.A Lesson in Scale for NOK StockSure, it's remotely possible that the return of the 3310 at $50 will somehow dramatically reverse 16 years of technology progress, and be enough to convince a new generation of back-to-basics consumers to trade in their smartphones, I find it unlikely.7 Stocks That Will Hit All-Time Highs in 2017I just don't see that happening here in numbers that even double NOK's market share, and even if it does, an extra 35 million $50 handsets sold close to cost really isn't going to move the needle for NOK stock. Even if the company manages to book half the retail price on each phone as revenue, it's going to take 120 million of them to add 10% to the top line.That's the real lesson of scale here. NOK never went away; it's still a big company, built on the chassis of the old Alcatel and Lucent networking businesses. Now that it has its phones back from MSFT, management needs to deploy them to embrace the future and expand on the role the company wants to play in the Internet of Things (IoT).To me, that means developing phones that don't compete withApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) or Samsung for consumer pocket space, but ones that instead let smart devices communicate with each other. Consider that, in a world of billions of $50 machine-to-machine data relays, the market becomes very interesting for NOK stock investors.It's a similar story for BBRY, which was evolving nicely into an IoT proposition, until now. We may feel nostalgic for the days of a ubiquitous business BlackBerry, but that era was over more than a decade ago. We've since learned to type on virtual keyboards.7 Stocks to Buy That Are ALMOST in Buffett Buying RangeThe question I have about the next generation of BBRY devices revolves around what great things they can do to win consumers away from the iPhones and Androids that already dominate the market. They need to trigger a revolution and not just recapitulate the past.The bottom line is, as interesting as it was to get a blast from the past from these two companies, I just don't see this strategy being a boon for either stock right now.Hilary Kramer is the editor ofGameChangers,Breakout Stocks,High Octane Trader,Absolute Capital ReturnandValue Authority.

Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Isn’t Infallible After All;3/3/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN), which has ambitions of putting a warehouse in the sky and delivering products by drone, among other projects, seemingly can do no wrong, positioning AMZN stocknear all-time highs. AMZN stock closed Thursday at $848.91, up 13% year to date, while soaring 53% over the past year.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockBut, the recent outage of Amazon's web-based Simple Storage Service (S3), which disrupted websites, apps and smart devices across the country, shows the Seattle-based e-commerce giant isn't infallible, after all. But, don't hold your breath thinking this glitch will put a damper on AMZN stock.According to the company's statement, the outage impacting the S3 cloud services was due to human error. An issue in the S3 billing process was being debugged by members of the Amazon Simple Storage Service team. In an attempt to rectify the issue, which involved taking down a small number of servers, one of the engineers entered an incorrect keystroke.""An authorized S3 team member using an established playbook executed a command which was intended to remove a small number of servers for one of the S3 subsystems that is used by the S3 billing process,"" Amazon saidin a statement on its website. ""Unfortunately, one of the inputs to the command was entered incorrectly and a larger set of servers was removed than intended.""The servers that were mistakenly taken down supported two other S3 subsystems, which triggered a widespread outage impacting government services, news sites, the Securities and Exchange Commission, Business Insider, Quora and Slack and a host of other institutions considered significant to the internet infrastructure.7 Stocks That Will Hit All-Time Highs in 2017It remains to be seen whether this issue will cause Amazon to lose any customers to competing cloud platforms such as those offered byMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) orAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL). To its credit, however, Amazon didn't try to hide behind its mistake, saying Thursday it was making several changes to avoid the potential of similar problems in the future.""We want to apologize for the impact this event caused for our customers. While we are proud of our long track record of availability with Amazon S3, we know how critical this service is to our customers, their applications and end users, and their businesses."" Amazon said in its statement. ""We will do everything we can to learn from this event and use it to improve our availability even further.""Bottom Line for AMZN StockThough Amazon might lose some support in terms of AWS being touted as best-of-breed cloud, AMZN stock won't be affected, given the many growth tailwinds Amazon still has. For fiscal 2017, Amazon is expected to earn $7.25 per share on revenue of $165.2 billion, marking year-over-year increases of 48% and 21.5%, respectively. As such, Amazon stock should continue to march toward $1,000 per share in the next 12-18 months, 18% returns.As of this writing, Richard Saintvilus did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 Dangerous Dividend Stocks to Dump Now5 Blue-Chip Stocks to Sell in March7 Stocks to Buy That Are ALMOST in Buffett Buying RangeThe postAmazon.com, Inc.

Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock Became a Market Stunner — Can it Last?;3/3/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIf I'm being painfully transparent, I almost want to callAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NYSE:AMD) ""fake news."" A little more than two years ago, AMD stock was trading for under two bucks. Now, it has been toying with $15 with little sign of slowing down. And I don't consider a near 5% loss on the day to be a sign of anything. This is especially true considering Advanced Micro Devices is up 22.6% for the year so far.makeArticleAd();Source:Matthew Rutledge via FlickrI understand the point that rallies can be extremely pronounced from the depths of market volatility. We've seen similar patterns in the number one rival for AMD stock:Intel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC). Those that bought the dips inNvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA) and held on for the big surge were handsomely rewarded.But these are companies that are recognized leaders in their field of specialty. AMD, in contrast, historically has been the discount leader, playing catch-up with the big boys.Still, AMD stock registered an amazing 295% run last year. Even more astounding, speculators that caught AMD in mid-February of 2016 saw their investment rise by around 600%! Go in hard with a couple performances like that and you'll be out of the rat race in no time.But is there any growth remaining in Advanced Micro Devices?A Game Changer (Literally!) for AMD StockInvestorPlace contributor Joseph Hargett certainly thinks so. His bullishness isn't based just on the momentum begetting momentum thesis. Rather, Hargett sees the company's latestRyzen CPUas a game changer, something that will put the hurting on Intel. From the initial reports, it's hard to disagree.3 Ignored Tech ETFs That Are Too Good to Pass UpRyzen will go head-to-head with Intel's flagship i7 processor, which isn't a surprising move in and of itself. Advanced Micro Devices and Intel have always warred for consumer attention like bitter siblings. Naturally, Intel has had the upper hand, whereas AMD was considered the ""poor man's Intel."" That same dynamic can be found in the markets, with AMD stock gyrating from euphoria to despair and back again.Although it's a commonly expressed sentiment with mixed results, this time could be different for Advanced Micro Devices. The Ryzen is armed with more features than the i7, including attributes that are vital to its core video-gamer base.Most importantly, it clocks in at half the price of its rival's offering, which will inevitably draw much excitement. AMD has previously supplied chips toMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) andSony Corp (ADR)(NYSE:SNE) for their video game systems.On the technical front, Hargett notes that there's significantshorting activityin AMD stock. All it would take are a few good reviews, and that will send shares moving higher. Those who are short Advanced Micro Devices will have to cover their position to stay in it. But the overwhelming upside pressure could be too much, forcing them to close their transaction. In order to do that, borrowed shares of AMD stock that initiated the short would have to be bought back.After those market gymnastics, demand for AMD shoots even higher.Advanced Micro Devices Still Has to Face the MusicOf course, the obvious risk is whether or not the computing industry bites. Maybe after intensive reviews, the Ryzen isn't what it seemed to be. After all, we are talking about semiconductors. This sector has a bloody history of punishing missteps - and not everyone makes it out alive. Considering that AMD stock is still very much a speculative investment, the obvious risk is not one to take lightly.I think we can all appreciate the moxy that Advanced Micro Devices has shown. Other companies could have simply folded under the trials, but not AMD - good for them. But we also can't ignore the reality of the situation. AsInvestorPlacecontributor Ryan Furhmann notes, ""Intel is expected to report sales of around $59 billion this year. AMD stock will log just over $4 billion in sales, making it about7% the sizeof Intel.""Due to the easing of the supply glut in computer chip products, some might think we're entering into a semiconductor renaissance. I look at it more as the changing of the tide. However, the ocean is still the ocean. AMD stock and others can enjoy the favorable tailwind, but eventually, there will be another challenge.The question is, will AMD be strong enough to weather it?It's a Super-Risky PropositionIf you look at the technical momentum, you have to like the chances for AMD stock. Shares are moving firmly in a bullish trend channel. Aside from some overheating readings, the standard technical barometers are signaling green. As Wall Street likes to say, the trend is your friend.Click to EnlargeOrdinarily, I'd agree. But darn it, the fundamental picture for AMD stock is ugly. It's so ugly that I would reference a part of the human anatomy as a prefix if I could. But I'm going to keep it clean.Here's the deal - based on the Altman Z-score, the only thing that Advanced Micro Devices has been doing is moving from one state of distress to another. We're not arguing whether the company is on stable ground: it's not. We're just analyzing magnitude of troubles.Snap Inc. (SNAP): Snapchat IPO ALMOST Beats the OddsFor a contrarian, buying when others are selling is an art form. But what happens when everybody else is buying the same troubled stock? Furthermore, shouldn't an embattled company make substantive strides of improvement?Strictly from the data, AMD moved from intractably distressed to ""normal"" distressed. That is an improvement, I'll concede. But at some point, the dial has got to move to at least a grey zone. Sadly, AMD stock is well far away from that. So even though it has been an incredible ride, I think investors need to be cautious here.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto was long SNE stock.More From InvestorPlace7 Stocks That Will Hit All-Time Highs in 201710 Dangerous Dividend Stocks to Dump NowThe postAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc.

Stocks recently featured in the blog includeFacebook(NASDAQ:FB-Free Report),Microsoft(NASDAQ:MSFT-Free Report),Line(NYSE:LN-Free Report) andTwitter(NYSE:TWTR-Free Report).Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations.Get #1Stock of the Day pick for free.Here are highlights from Thursday's Analyst   Blog:As Snapchat IPOs, Competition Steals Its Best IdeasLast year, Instagram, the popular photo-sharing app, announced a new feature called ""Stories"" where users can post photo and video slideshows that disappear after a 24-hour period. This sounds shamelessly familiar to Snapchat Stories, which also allows users to post photos and videos in a slideshow format that disappears after 24 hours.This isn't the first time Instagram has tried to replicate Snapchat. Back in 2014, it launched Bolt, a private messaging service that lets you send one-tap photos and videos, much like Snapchat, but is now defunct.Instagram CEO Kevin Systrom has already acknowledged the blatant similarities between the respective Stories,tellingTechCrunchthat ""[Snapchat] deserves all the credit,"" but that ""This isn't about who invented something. This is about format, and how you take it to a network and put your own spin on it.""I mean, sure, putting your own spin on things is cool, but they could have at least come up with a different name.And Then There's FacebookFacebook (NASDAQ:FB-Free Report), (who coincidentally, or conveniently, owns Instagram), has been formatting many of its new features and apps based off of Snapchat for a few years now. In late 2012, Facebook launched Poke, an almost exact clone of Snapchat that unsurprisingly failed, and then in 2013, it tried to straight up buy Snapchat for a whopping $3 billion. Snapchat turned down that offer, spurring atech chase for the ages.Following Poke, Facebook announced its app called Slingshot in 2014, which worked exactly like Snapchat but with one distinct feature: before a user could view a message, they had to send a message back. These required replies lasted for only three months before Facebook removed them from Slingshot, and the app sat around for about a year afterwards before being officially removed.Other Snapchat rip-off ventures of Facebook include disappearing posts, disappearing messages in Messenger, photo editing options where you can swipe through filters and position text and emoji, face-altering filters thanks to its acquisition of the app MSQRD, a face-swapping app, and Messenger Codes, which are scannable dots and dashes around your profile picture letting you add a person as a contact. Messenger Codes is almost exactly the same as Snapchat's Snapcodes.The company recently debuted a new Snapchat-like feature in its WhatsApp Messenger platform that lets users post pictures and videos to a new feed that deletes itself after 24 hours, dubbed ""WhatsApp Status."" Find out more about that in the latest episode of Zacks Tech Talk Tuesday with host Ryan McQueeneyhere.Facebook isn't the only big company looking at Snapchat for new ideas. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT-Free Report) also has a Snapchat clone on the market called WindUp, which lets users share photos and videos, as well as text and audio snippets. You can set a time limit for your friends to view messages before they expire, or can stick to a traditional view limit. WindUp isstill availablein Microsoft's app store.Even Wall Street newbie Line (NYSE:LN-Free Report), the Japanese messaging app, also has Snapchat-like features. In 2014, the company updated its app so that users can send content to their friends as hidden photos or messages, which will not display until the receiver clicks on them. And, the photo or message will disappear depending on the time set by the sender.Snapchat, King of the TeensIf all of these influential tech and internet companies have spent the better part of four years trying to emulate Snapchat, then what is it about the app that makes it so compelling? Why is everyone copying Snapchat?Ever since its official debut in 2012, Snapchat has steadily climbed the social media ranks, having gained the top spot among teenagers over Twitter (NYSE:TWTR-Free Report), Facebook, and even Instagram. According toMashable, who cited a Piper Jaffray study, 6,500 U.S. teens were polled ""to see what they felt was the most important social network, and Snapchat took 28% of votes. Instagram came in close-second with 27%, followed by Twitter and Facebook.""Ah, so that's why: teenagers love Snapchat, and teenagers are a coveted demographic for any tech company.Over the last year or so, Snapchat has been launching new unique feature after new unique feature, introducing things like Snapchat Discover, expanding its video and picture filter library, and partnering with events like the Oscars, where the app let its users watch live behind-the-scenes footage of the red carpet and the actual show.Snapchat is asocial, ephemeral experiencethat favors photos and videos over text-based media. And as the study shows, teenagers prefer this type of digital platform.Why Snapchat RulesBut I think it's more than just that. Snapchat has been consistently keeping its platform interesting and innovative, while other social media companies have more or less remained stagnant, or just copied Snapchat's ideas. Snapchat is fresh, and it has created a world inhabited mostly by teenagers and young adults and their favorite brands and celebrities. No parents allowed.It's no wonder, then, that everyone is trying to copy Snapchat. Its CEO is 26-year-old Evan Spiegel, a guy who more or less invented the app as part of a class final during his time at Stanford. It's the preferred app for any major live event or top celebrity. Above all, Snapchat is cool. Where Facebook appeals to older generations and Instagram to ""capturing the perfect moment,"" Snapchat is for everything in between.Snapchat is for the ""real,"" or at least the real behind text, emoji, filters, and face swaps. And for most people in the social media age, and especially teenagers, ""real"" reigns supreme.About Zacks Equity ResearchZacks Equity Research provides the best of quantitative and qualitative analysis to help investors know what stocks to buy and which to sell for the long-term.Continuous coverage is provided for a universe of 1,150 publicly traded stocks.

Alphabet Could Be Berkshire's Next Tech Buy;3/2/2017;"After loading up onApple(AAPL) shares, couldBerkshire Hathaway(NYSE:BRK.A) (NYSE:BRK.B) buyAlphabet Inc.(GOOG) (GOOGL) shares next? Alphabet has been bought aggressively by multiple famous gurus. Buffett and Munger have commented favorably on the company's competitive position several times. The latest Berkshire shareholder letter indicates Buffett is very knowledgeable about the technology space.The fact that so many value investors are buying Alphabet at current multiples indicate it is a great business at a fair price. It is not immediately obvious how popular the stock is because Alphabet trades an A and a C share class, which are treated as seperate companies by lists put together through automation. They are economically equivalent, however, and if you add them up, Alphabet is one of the highest-owned stocks among the great investors tracked by GuruFocus.Back in 2009,Warren Buffett(Trades,Portfolio) talked aboutIBM(IBM), Apple and Google:makeArticleAd();""The chances of being way wrong in IBM are probably less, at least for us, than the chances of being way wrong in Google or Apple. I just don't know how to value them.I would not be at all surprised to see them be worth a lot more money 10 years from now but I would not buy either one of them. I sure as hell wouldn't short them either.""In addition,Charlie Munger(Trades, Portfolio) said:""Google has a huge new moat. In fact, I've probably never seen such a wide moat.""Munger added it was also filled with sharks. It is impossible to assess a moat without understanding competitors and their chances to successfully assault a company's market share. In this case, Munger might have seen the potential early while Buffett remained unconvinced. Buffett has alluded to his biggest mistakes as acts of omission.Bill Gates, formerMicrosoft(MSFT) chairman and a good friend of Buffett, stepped down in 2014. Microsoft runs the only real competition to Google search. Gates stepping down may have freed Buffett to learn about that competitive landscape from him.In additon, Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin and Chairman Eric Schmidt traveled to Omaha to talk to Buffett when setting up the new Alphabet structure, which is molded after Berkshire.Shortly before the trip, they brought in CFO Ruth Porat, who understands the tech founders' goals for the company.Buffett included the following paragraphs in the 2017 shareholder letter, putting my spider senses on red alert:""In 2002, entrepreneur Mitch Kapor asserted that 'By 2029 no computer - or 'machine intelligence' - will have passed the Turing Test,' which deals with whether a computer can successfully impersonate a human being. Inventor Ray Kurzweil took the opposing view. Each backed up his opinion with $10,000. I don't know who will win this bet, but I will confidently wager that no computer will ever replicate Charlie.That same year, Craig Mundie of Microsoft asserted that pilotless planes would routinely fly passengers by 2030, while Eric Schmidt of Google argued otherwise. The stakes were $1,000 each. To ease any heartburn Eric might be experiencing from his outsized exposure, I recently offered to take a piece of his action. He promptly laid off $500 with me. (I like his assumption that I'll be around in 2030 to contribute my payment, should we lose.)""This paragraph shows Buffett has been studying the tech world very hard and is open to the possibility the Turing test will be cracked by 2029. He also must have looked into the dynamics of driverless or pilotless technology, note the recent investment into airlines, to take on a $500 bet. I do not think betting against Buffett is generally a profitable endeavour. What jumped out at me is, apparently, Alphabet's chairman and Buffett recently spoke again. They must have spoken for quite some time for the subject of this casual bet to come up.All these factors have led me to speculate on the potential of an Alphabet investment.The pieces are falling into place.Buffett has been studying tech intensely.Berkshire has made a 180 as far as tech investments go.Buffett and Munger view Alphabet as having an incredibly strong moat.Alphabet's valuation is at an attractive level given the interest from the value investing greats. Porat is a great addition to the executive suite ,covering up pre-existing weaknesses in the team.Google executives have met with Buffett on multiple occasions and Schmidt talked to him recently.The one thing I could see keeping Buffett from making an investment is his distaste for stock-based compensation. Alphabet continues to dole it out like it is candy on Halloween.I would go as far as to say it would greatly surprise me if we do not see Berkshire buying a stake in Alphabet in the next five years.Disclosure: Author owns none of these stocks.Start afree 7-day trial of Premium Membershipto GuruFocus.Premium MembersThis article first appeared onGuruFocus."

How to Trade Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) After Federal Raid;3/2/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsToday is a dayCaterpillar Inc.(NYSE:CAT) shareholders will wish they stayed in bed. CAT stock finished more than 4% lower in response to the sight of federal agents raiding the heavy equipment juggernaut's offices.makeArticleAd();Source:Anthony via FlickrI'm betting the Feds aren't looking to buy farm equipment. And so are the denizens of the Street. In true shoot-first-and-ask-questions-later fashion, traders are liquidating Caterpillar shares from their portfolios with prejudice.Despite the damage, CAT stock remained above all significant support levels. So it remains to be seen if today's decline will morph into a trend-killing breakdown.Trading volume ran hot all day, with 23 million shares changing hands by day's end.Click to EnlargeNot surprisingly, there was a mad dash into the options pit for protection. Option premiums for downside puts are exploding today as investors scoop up insurance just in case today's raid is the tip of the iceberg. Implied volatility ripped higher throughout the trading session, ending near a 52-week high.5 Blue-Chip Stocks to Sell in MarchThe action in CAT today presents some attractive trading opportunities for bulls and bears alike. While the fallout to today's surprising news is impossible to predict, the marketplace is paying you to take risk right now.Let's explore two trade ideas: one bull and one bear.A CAT Stock Trade for Everyone!Bear:To capitalize on additional selling, consider buying a put spread. By purchasing a near-the-money put and selling a far out-of-the-money put option, we can create a position that exploits the relative expensiveness of downside puts.Buy the Apr $90/$85 put spread for $1.05 or better.Consider it a cheap bet that Caterpillar shares remain heavy for the month ahead. The risk is limited to the initial $1.05 debit and will be lost if CAT stock sits above $90 at expiration.The reward is limited to the distance between strikes minus the net debit, or $3.95, and will be captured if the stock falls below $85 by expiration. With such a large potential reward in the offing, there's no reason to get greedy here. I suggest taking profits if the put spread rises to $2.10, giving you a 100% return.Bull:If you think today's swoon is overblown, then there are numerous ways to exploit the fear.3 Reasons to Sell Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock NOWConsider selling the Apr $85 put options for $1.15.As long as CAT stock sits above $85 at expiration, the put will expire worthless, allowing you to pocket the $1.15 credit. The puts reside about 10% out-of-the-money, so we'd have to see strong follow-through to today's drop without any recovery for you to lose money at expiration.And, if you're a willing buyer of CAT shares in the $85 region, you could allow assignment if the put sits in-the-money at expiration. You will have to buy 100 shares of stock for each put sold.As of this writing, Tyler Craig did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 Dangerous Dividend Stocks to Dump NowSell the Bounce In Fitbit Inc (FIT) StockMicrosoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock Is Worth About $100 Billion Too MuchThe postHow to Trade Caterpillar Inc.

What Does Warren Buffett See in Apple?;3/2/2017;"SinceWarren Buffett(Trades,Portfolio)'s annual letter came out and he followed up with a lengthy interview on CNBC where he talked about how much moreApple(AAPL) stock Berkshire now owned - and how he was the one who bought most of it - I have gotten a lot of email questions asking about his purchase.This is not the first time I have received a slew of emails questioning the logic of one of Buffett's investments. Since I have been writing articles about investing, he has made four investments that really got a reaction from value investors who doubted the logic of what he was doing. These include: Buffett's initial purchase of railroad stocks and his subsequent purchase of all of Burlington Northern, his investment inIBM(IBM) despite him having said he does not invest in tech stocks, his investment in the four major U.S. airlines despite the fact he has said the airline industry is a terrible one for investors and now his investment in Apple.Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE:BRK.A)(NYSE:BRK.B) investment in Apple is far from the most controversial of these cases. A bunch of other value investors like the stock. It is a reasonably priced stock on an enterprise value basis - Apple has a lot of net cash, so its market cap exaggerates the valuation being put on the company. But, each of these investments by Buffett is an example of him moving into an area he had not previously touched. I am not sure Buffett ever invested in a railroad stock despite the fact that when he started his career - in the early 1950s - railroad stocks were a much bigger part of the investment landscape than they are today. Buffett may not have bought tech stocks before IBM - but it is, in most every other respect, the kind of stock Buffett would normally buy.makeArticleAd();Also, Buffett previously said the reason he never ownedMicrosoft(MSFT) was because no matter whether it was true or not - people would assume the purchase was the result of inside information from his friend,Bill Gates(Trades, Portfolio). He also said, however, that at one pointMicrosoft stockgot to a price - presumably, this is sometime after the 2008 financial crisis - that seemed low to him. Buffett rarely talks about whether the price of a stock seems low, high, etc. unless he understands something about that business and that industry. So, it is not unreasonable to think Buffett believes he understands some things about Microsoft. And those things might allow him to - within a very wide value range - know whether even a tech stock like Microsoft is cheap or not.Now, let's look at Apple. What does Buffett see in that stock? The number one thing that appeals to Buffett about Apple is something that should not matter at all to you. Buffett is attracted to Apple's size. It is a huge stock. Buffett said on that same CNBC interview I mentioned that Berkshire was unlikely to take a bigger than 10% stake in a company because of the problems that presents. Berkshire has ended up with more than 10% of a company's stock, but that has often been helped along by share repurchases on the part of the company itself.Right now, Ted Weschler and Todd Combs are each running $10 billion portfolios at Berkshire. Those are the small portfolios. Buffett is investing at a whole order of magnitude more in size. But, let's start with just the kind of ideas Weschler and Combs need to come up with.Assume you are running a $10 billion portfolio that is fully invested in common stocks. Further assume you want to avoid buying more than 10% of a company's stock. Now, assume you are a concentrated type investor the way Buffett is. As I write, my own portfolio is 65% invested in just two stocks:Frost(CFR) andBWX Technologies(BWXT). It is 85% invested in just three stocks. The third stock, however, is a micro-cap. Managers investing billions of dollars cannot even look at a micro-cap. The very smallest stocks they can possibly buy are things like Frost and BWX Technologies. So, how much of their portfolio could they put in those two stocks? Remember, I have 65% of my portfolio in those stocks.Well, if you are managing $10 billion, and you are buying stock in a company with a market cap of about $6 billion (which is about the size of Frost and BWX), you can put just under $600 million into the company without crossing the 10% ownership threshold. So, say you have two good ideas that are each $6 billion companies - put them both together and you get just 12% of your portfolio in those stocks. Now, for me personally, I do not want to spend time worrying about a stock that is much less than 20% of my portfolio. Here, we are talking about stocks that are 6% of your portfolio if you buy absolutely as much of them as possible. You see the problem. And I have understated it.Buffett is running about 10 times what Weschler and Combs are running individually. And neither Frost nor BWX Technologies is a small company. Within its niche of Texan banks, Frost is the biggest. And within its niche of nuclear work for governments rather than civilians, BWX Technologies is the biggest. So, Buffett cannot be looking for companies that have market caps of $6 billion. He wants companies with market caps of $60 billion or even $600 billion. Apple has a market cap of even more than $600 billion. So, here we have a company where instead of putting just 5% of your portfolio into the stock at the very most, you might get the chance to put 10%, 20% or even 50% of your portfolio into the stock. When Buffett was running his partnership, he liked to put 25% into his best idea. In the case ofAmerican Express(AXP), he even went beyond that. If we do a little math with the amount of money Buffett manages at Berkshire, we can see that ideas in the $100 billion to $700 billion market cap range are really, really useful to him because he can potentially deploy $10 billion to $70 billion (10% of the value of these kinds of companies) into such gigantic public companies.Think about what kinds of companies you have in the $100 billion to $700 billion range. It is pretty limited. Buffett likes focused companies. He likes brands. A great idea for Buffett is something likeCoca-Cola(KO), American Express,Wells Fargo(WFC),Moody's(MCO), or Gillette. Those were great ideas because they were not just big companies. They did very few things in a very big way. Buffett's stake in Gillette got swapped intoProcter & Gamble(PG) stock. He eventually did a deal to get out of P&G by taking control of Duracell. Duracell is a big brand like Gillette. P&G is an even bigger company, but only a few of its brands are huge in a way that is useful to Buffett. P&G as a whole is more diversified into things that are not really as good as Gillette is on a standalone basis.Not only is Apple a huge company, it is a hugely focused company, which is attractive to Buffett. Apple's fortunes are now tied to one brand (as they really always have been) and largely to one product (the iPhone). When you listen to what Buffett said about Apple, you realize how important this is. Buffett said he likes Apple. He said he sees how integral the iPhone is to the lives of people - especially young people - who now have it. And he says that he sees - at places like the Nebraska Furniture Mart stores he owns - that people upgrade from one iPhone to another instead of considering competing brands. So, the investment thesis is surprisingly focused for a giant company. It really has to do with one brand and one product, the iPhone. That is it. Buffett can evaluate the stickiness of one consumer product and one brand. That makes Apple easier to understand than Procter & Gamble orDisney(DIS) or other giant consumer-oriented businesses that are actually much more diversified. Apple is not diversified. That is the potential attraction.Moving on, Buffett thinks Apple, like IBM, is not going to do a lot of big acquisitions. He thinks the company is going to buy back a lot of its own stock. This is a very common theme in a lot of his investments. One of the surest signs you can find for a ""catalyst"" that might change his thinking about a company is that company turning inward and focusing on the things it does best while dedicating its free cash flow toward reducing its share count year after year instead of expanding into other areas.Buffett is not an activist investor, but if you look at those areas where he has been most vocal - either while on a board, in the way he abstained from a vote or what he said to the press - it is almost always a capital allocation decision. It is usually related to the issuance of company stock. Sometimes it is related to overpaying. Nonetheless, he is constantly urging the management of the companies he invests in to focus on widening their moat, doing what they do best and investing in themselves at a reasonable price (by buying back their own stock) rather than investing in somebody else by overpaying.The only times I can think of Buffett having any complaints about Coca-Cola had to do with an acquisition the company wanted to do (at too high a price) or with giving stock to top executives. The stock grants to executives incident at Coke was reported in the press as Buffett complaining about executives being overpaid. I think the reason he abstained on that vote had more to do with the fact the company would be permitted to cause a lot of dilution if it used the program to the full extent it was asking shareholder approval for. So, it was probably more about Buffett wanting Coca-Cola to shrink its share count rather than grow it.When Buffett was asked on CNBC about the growth prospects of both IBM and Apple, he answered by talking about share buybacks. Before Buffett bought it, IBM had one of the longest and most aggressive histories of buying back its own stock you can find at any public company. A lot of Berkshire's investments have this feature. Look at how much American Express has shrunk its share count since Buffett bought that position. Or look at how much Coca-Cola has bought back of its own stock. In both cases, I'm pretty sure Berkshire's investments are worth at least 33% more than they otherwise would be because these companies have shrunk their share count by more than 25% while Berkshire owned them. Buffett mentioned in the CNBC interview that Apple had bought back almost 5% of its stock in a year. That is unlikely to be a one-time thing. Apple will have problems with where its cash is located - it will end up with a lot of cash that would be taxed if brought back to the U.S. - but it does not need cash to grow, it cannot grow that fast anymore organically and it does not do big acquisitions.For a tech company its size, Apple has historically been especially averse to acquisitions. A company as profitable as Apple that does not use money on high-priced, transformative acquisitions is eventually going to have to use that cash to buy back its own stock. There just are not any other realistic options. It could pay dividends; and because of Berkshire's own tax status, Buffett would benefit at least as much from dividends as from (fairly or overpriced) buybacks. He does not mind dividends, and he certainly does not mind buybacks at stocks he chose in the first place.What about Apple's lack of future growth? I think this actually attracts Buffett. That sounds counterintuitive. But, let me explain. Apple is a tech stock and a consumer product company. The most dangerous time to invest in tech stocks and consumer product stocks is when they sell a high-priced product to a small pool of customers. The reason for this is that it allows market entry at the low end. If you are selling $1,000 watches or $10,000 computers, someone can come in selling a cheaper and more basic version of the product to a large group of people who have never owned the product. All sorts of market leaders run into this problem. They have the biggest dollar share of the industry, but economies of scale - and certainly gains in experience - are driven in large by the unit volume you do. The leader is in an awkward position because trying to expand the market cuts into their profitability on a per-customer basis.If you are selling computers to corporate customers - you are not dreaming of the day when every living room in America can have a cheap, basic desktop. That future is potentially bad for you in several ways. One, it teaches whoever you are competing with a lot about many of the things you do. Two, it cheapens the image of what you are selling. Three, it changes the way you will have to sell what you are selling. Almost all technology, especially any sort of consumer tech, follows this pattern. It can be very tough for investors because it leads to a two-stage adoption of the technology.In phase one, one leader establishes their dominance in the ""pro"" market and the stock looks great. But, in phase two, another - and usually different - leader establishes their dominance in the ""consumer"" market. Then that stock looks great at the expense of the first leader. We could be talking about computers or cell phones here. But if you go back further in history, TVs and radios followed the same pattern too. These things are always invented long, long before you remember them being invented, but were not adopted quickly. People tend to remember when they started seeing cell phones everywhere, when they started using the internet in their own home and so on. Those years have nothing to do with when these products were first invented, commercialized and so forth. Often, there was a company you have completely forgotten about that made and lost a fortune before the time period you even think of the new consumer tech as being suddenly important to society.What does this have to do with Apple? It is part of a broader question. Just how ""moaty"" are consumer technology companies? At least on one side of the economic value equation, companies like Apple,Facebook(FB) andAlphabet's Google (GOOG)(GOOGL) depend entirely on the mass appeal of their product. We call them technology companies. Internally, I am sure they seem very technical to those inside the organization. But how much does technology drive the economic returns at these companies? And, at this point, how easy is it to attack any of these business models on some technical difference between your product and theirs? How much of what makes the iPhone successful is the Apple brand, the fact a customer already owns an iPhone and is used to using it, the fact a customer's friends, family and peers already own an iPhone and, as a consequence, the fact other entrepreneurs and organizations have invested time money and effort in trying to reach people by designing products to be used on an iPhone?In other words, has the iPhone become the default choice for customers because the Apple brand is good enough, the status quo is good enough, people are not all going to jump on another bandwagon together and the suppliers are going to be where the demand is? Is the iPhone always going to be the easiest choice? This is exactly the same question for Facebook and Google. A very long time ago, I wrote that while I did not ownGoogle stockand did not know how the organization would develop over time as a company, I did know that understanding anything technical about a search engine no longer mattered. Google does not need to be the world's best search engine to be the world's most popular search engine. The advantages it has are too entrenched and the differences between one set of search results and another are so small - Google does not really have to compete on quality anymore. Google is enough of a brand and search is enough of a commodity that it does not matter.The things that got Apple to the position it is now in are not necessarily the things that will keep it there. A lot of readers emailed me asking about Apple's brand and whether it would last. The answer to that is yes and no. It will be a recognizable brand that is seen as good enough in a decade or two. I would be very surprised if that changed. On the other hand, I would be surprised if the Apple brand was seen as being particularly innovative or standing for very specific design choices or anything like that in a decade or two. Coca-Cola is a great brand, but it is not a very specific brand. It cannot be anymore. When people think cola they think Coca-Cola. And when people think phone - they think Apple. But, Apple will not need to convince anyone to try a smartphone for the first time anymore. They do not really even have to convince anyone to try an Apple product for the first time anymore.Apple has very high returns on the money it actually ties up in its business. The numbers look lower because they have excess cash. Likewise, the stock looks more expensive than it is because it has a lot of excess cash. If Apple's sales grow somewhere between nominal GDP and the rate of inflation in the countries where it operates in and the company dedicates every cent it makes - or more, since Apple already has net cash - to buying back its own shares, it will still be a ""growth"" stock on an EPS basis. For an example of this, see BWX Technologies. It is not really a growth company at all in terms of what it does. It does not gain new customers (outside of the U.S. Navy). It does not win totally new projects (outside of the carriers and subs it has long provided reactors for). And it does not even get many more orders for a higher build rate for the number of those ships now than it did in the recent past. Despite all that, the company just put out a press release saying it expected a ""low double-digit"" EPS growth rate for the next three to five years. That is a growth stock, but it is one because it is doing something very, very profitable on a return on capital basis. It is retaining all the business it already has and growing the business it retains a tiny but consistent bit, and then it is taking all the money it makes and buying back its own stock. When a super high-quality business buys back its own stock, it is not impossible to turn an underlying 5% type growth rate in how much more your customers actually want into more like a 10% growth rate in the earnings you report per share.IBM is another good example of that. In the 10 years before Buffett bought the stock, it was not very good at company-wide revenue growth. Over the last decade, IBM had close to 9% annual EPS growth at the same time it had close to zero percent revenue growth. A lot of that is accomplished simply by not growing the assets you tie up in the business at all (IBM's net tangible assets actually shrank over the last decade) and then taking all your free cash flow and - instead of growing assets like most companies do - use it to reduce your share count.What Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio) sees in Apple is probably a slow growth, wide moat consumer brand that can use all its free cash flow to buy back its own stock and thereby be a high-growth stock in terms of EPS, even while it is slow growth in terms of additional units sold. Apple may not be a growth company anymore, but that does not mean it cannot be a growth stock. All Buffett cares about is the growth in earnings per share. So, he is not necessarily betting Apple can sell a lot more iPhones over the next five to 10 years. What Buffett's betting on is Apple's ability to report a lot more in earnings per share over the next five to 10 years.Disclosures: Long CFR, BWXTStart afree 7-day trial of Premium Membershipto GuruFocus.Premium MembersThis article first appeared onGuruFocus."

As Snapchat IPOs, Its Competition Is Stealing Its Best Ideas;3/2/2017;"Last year, Instagram, the popular photo-sharing app, announced a new feature called ""Stories"" where users can post photo and video slideshows that disappear after a 24-hour period. This sounds shamelessly familiar to Snapchat Stories, which also allows users to post photos and videos in a slideshow format that disappears after 24 hours.This isn't the first time Instagram has tried to replicate Snapchat. Back in 2014, it launched Bolt, a private messaging service that lets you send one-tap photos and videos, much like Snapchat, but is now defunct.Instagram CEO Kevin Systrom has already acknowledged the blatant similarities between the respective Stories,tellingTechCrunchthat ""[Snapchat] deserves all the credit,"" but that ""This isn't about who invented something. This is about format, and how you take it to a network and put your own spin on it.""I mean, sure, putting your own spin on things is cool, but they could have at least come up with a different name.And Then There's FacebookFacebookFB, (who coincidentally, or conveniently, owns Instagram), has been formatting many of its new features and apps based off of Snapchat for a few years now. In late 2012, Facebook launched Poke, an almost exact clone of Snapchat that unsurprisingly failed, and then in 2013, it tried to straight up buy Snapchat for a whopping $3 billion. Snapchat turned down that offer, spurring atech chase for the ages.Following Poke, Facebook announced its app called Slingshot in 2014, which worked exactly like Snapchat but with one distinct feature: before a user could view a message, they had to send a message back. These required replies lasted for only three months before Facebook removed them from Slingshot, and the app sat around for about a year afterwards before being officially removed.Other Snapchat rip-off ventures of Facebook include disappearing posts, disappearing messages in Messenger, photo editing options where you can swipe through filters and position text and emoji, face-altering filters thanks to its acquisition of the app MSQRD, a face-swapping app, and Messenger Codes, which are scannable dots and dashes around your profile picture letting you add a person as a contact. Messenger Codes is almost exactly the same as Snapchat's Snapcodes.The company recently debuted a new Snapchat-like feature in its WhatsApp Messenger platform that lets users post pictures and videos to a new feed that deletes itself after 24 hours, dubbed ""WhatsApp Status."" Find out more about that in the latest episode of Zacks Tech Talk Tuesday with host Ryan McQueeneyhere.Facebook isn't the only big company looking at Snapchat for new ideas. MicrosoftMSFTalso has a Snapchat clone on the market called WindUp, which lets users share photos and videos, as well as text and audio snippets. You can set a time limit for your friends to view messages before they expire, or can stick to a traditional view limit. WindUp isstill availablein Microsoft's app store.Even Wall Street newbie LineLN, the Japanese messaging app, also has Snapchat-like features. In 2014, the company updated its app so that users can send content to their friends as hidden photos or messages, which will not display until the receiver clicks on them. And, the photo or message will disappear depending on the time set by the sender.Snapchat, King of the TeensIf all of these influential tech and internet companies have spent the better part of four years trying to emulate Snapchat, then what is it about the app that makes it so compelling? Why is everyone copying Snapchat?Ever since its official debut in 2012, Snapchat has steadily climbed the social media ranks, having gained the top spot among teenagers over TwitterTWTR, Facebook, and even Instagram. According toMashable, who cited a Piper Jaffray study, 6,500 U.S. teens were polled ""to see what they felt was the most important social network, and Snapchat took 28% of votes. Instagram came in close-second with 27%, followed by Twitter and Facebook.""Ah, so that's why: teenagers love Snapchat, and teenagers are a coveted demographic for any tech company.Over the last year or so, Snapchat has been launching new unique feature after new unique feature, introducing things like Snapchat Discover, expanding its video and picture filter library, and partnering with events like the Oscars, where the app let its users watch live behind-the-scenes footage of the red carpet and the actual show.Snapchat is asocial, ephemeral experiencethat favors photos and videos over text-based media. And as the study shows, teenagers prefer this type of digital platform.Why Snapchat RulesBut I think it's more than just that. Snapchat has been consistently keeping its platform interesting and innovative, while other social media companies have more or less remained stagnant, or just copied Snapchat's ideas. Snapchat is fresh, and it has created a world inhabited mostly by teenagers and young adults and their favorite brands and celebrities. No parents allowed.It's no wonder, then, that everyone is trying to copy Snapchat. Its CEO is 26-year-old Evan Spiegel, a guy who more or less invented the app as part of a class final during his time at Stanford. It's the preferred app for any major live event or top celebrity. Above all, Snapchat is cool. Where Facebook appeals to older generations and Instagram to ""capturing the perfect moment,"" Snapchat is for everything in between.Snapchat is for the ""real,"" or at least the real behind text, emoji, filters, and face swaps. And for most people in the social media age, and especially teenagers, ""real"" reigns supreme.Last week, Editor Maddy Johnson and Content Writer Ryan McQueeney, hosts of the Zacks Friday Finish Line podcast, previewed Snap's IPO on their show. They were joined once again by Kathleen Smith, co-founder of Renaissance Capital, to discuss Snapchat, and if it would live up to its high, and pricey, IPO expectations.Check it out now!Everything You Need to Know About Snapchat's IPO   NowYou may be curious about the buzz surrounding Snap Inc.'s IPO, but should you snap up this tech stock on Day 1?

Following Salesforce's Earnings Beat, International Expansion And Einstein Adoption In Focus;3/2/2017;"Salesforce(CRM) performed impressively in Q4 fiscal 2017, with year-over-year revenue growth of nearly 27%. Subscription fees and support revenues were primary contributor, growing over 25% driven by the increased adoption of enterprise cloud computing solutions. Salesforce is betting big on its AI CRM platform, Einstein, and we expect it to boost adoption of the company's cloud solutions. However, the company's stock price fell due to weak Q1 guidance, attributed largely to seasonality and a difficult year-on-year comparison.What Went Well?The company saw strong revenue growth in its product categories. Sales Cloud - the company's flagship product - grew 13% over the prior year and continued to be the largest contributor to the Subscription and Support segment. Service Cloud and Marketing Cloud saw revenue increases of around 27% and 42%, respectively. Geographically, Salesforce continued to perform well in the Americas region, which contributed 74% of total revenues and grew 27% year-on-year $6.23 billion for fiscal 2017. Asia-Pacific - where the public cloud market is expected to grow at 12% and reach $11.5 billionby 2018, per Gartner- witnessed the most growth for the company, with revenues from the region increasing 34% y-o-y to $793 million. The increased focus on the Asian market is likely to benefit the company in the long term.makeArticleAd();Key ConcernProfitability remains a key area of focus for Salesforce, as its GAAP EPS remained negative at $(0.07) in the fourth quarter, though non-GAAP EPS of $0.28 was up 47% from the prior year. Operating expenses grew at over 25% as the company continued to spend extensively on sales and R&D in order to effectively compete with rivals such as SAP and Microsoft. This trend is not expected to change in the near term, and Salesforce is likely to remain acquisitive going forward.Looking AheadGoing forward, the company expects its growth momentum to continue into the coming year, as the company expects to generate revenues of over $10.1 billion for the full year. We expect an increased adoption rate internationally, as the demand for cloud solutions and integrated end-to-end CRM solutions with AI support grows globally.See our complete analysis for     SalesforceSee More at Trefis|View Interactive Institutional Research(Powered by Trefis)Get Trefis Technology"

Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock Is Worth About $100 Billion Too Much;3/2/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) stock continues to trade just off all-time highs, with its market capitalization now at $500 billion. I continue to be surprised at the strength shown by Microsoft stock. MSFT stock has risen roughly 150% in just four years - despite little movement in profits. Adjusted earnings per share were $2.78 in fiscal 2012 and only a penny more, at $2.79, in fiscal 2016.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockAdmittedly, there are some reasons for the increase in the Microsoft stock price. Both investors and customers are high on the Azure cloud platform. The Surface product line shows significant promise. And CEO Satya Nadella has received top marks from analysts and shareholders.There's a real case that the ""new"" Microsoft is different from the ""old"" Microsoft, which has been to the benefit of MSFT stock. Earnings growth should return: Wall Street consensus estimates forecast a 7% increase in FY17 per-share earnings and 9% the following fiscal year.But even that doesn't seem enough to keep Microsoft stock above $60. MSFT is valued at almost 22 times FY17 earnings, a multiple that implies consistent growth. Meanwhile, Windows and legacy Office products are declining and most of the new initiatives cannibalize existing sales, in at least some manner.7 Stocks That Will Hit All-Time Highs in 2017Microsoft obviously isn't going to collapse, and long-awaited earnings growth may just be at hand. But more modest growth expectations seem to support a share price closer to $50 than to $60.Growth Drivers Simply Aren't That BigAll the bullish talk surrounding Microsoft stock seems to focus on the Azure cloud offering and the Surface line. But those two categories aren't major drivers here: combined, they drive less than 10% of total sales (Azure is estimated to bring in around$2.5 billion.)To be sure, cloud as a whole is a bigger part of MSFT revenue. The company is looking for a $20 billion run rate in commercial cloud in FY18, which would imply more than 20% of total sales coming from the cloud. Surface is a great product and a Surface Phone could - finally - get Microsoft a consistent presence in the smartphone space.8 of the Most Overrated Stocks on Wall Street Right NowAll told, I can see the reason for some optimism regarding the two growth drivers. But not too much, considering that growth in both categories has some drawbacks.Taking Revenue From ElsewhereThe other issue with counting on Azure and Surface, beyond their relatively small contribution, is that growth in both categories is coming from the existing revenue base. The $20 billion commercial cloud figure sounds great - but that growth is coming largely from Office 365 and Azure. Revenue from those products isn't new to Microsoft; much of it is coming from legacy, disk-based Office customers and/or existing SQL buyers.Even Surface isn't necessarily a pure growth driver. Taking a sale from a rival likeHP Inc(NYSE:HPQ) is a win, but an HP sale still drives Windows 10-related revenue for MSFT. That software revenue drops to the bottom line at much higher margin than sales of a Surface product.Basically, growth isn't 100% organic for Microsoft. It doesn't portend some sort of top-line acceleration for the company as a whole, nor does it make MSFT stock a growth play.A Winner In Declining BusinessesAdding to those concerns is that Microsoft isn't quite as well-positioned in the newer areas. Azure is second toAmazon.com, Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AMZN) Amazon Web Services (AWS). Microsoft wants to grow in China, but so doesAlibaba Group Holding Ltd(NYSE:BABA), which is rolling out its own AWS-type solution.For Office 365,Tableau Software Inc(NYSE:DATA) is challenging Excel - and 27% revenue growth in 2016 suggests DATA is taking share from MSFT. Behemoths likeOracle Corporation(NYSE:ORCL) and many others are in the cloud space. Microsoft's Dynamics CRM product is a distant second tosalesforce.com, inc.(NYSE:CRM).There are still a lot of obstacles and a number of tough competitors in the way of Microsoft's growth. In fact, in most of the key areas, Microsoft is second place, at best.Bottom Line for Microsoft StockOverall, the idea that Microsoft stock is pricing in accelerated growth strikes me as far too optimistic. There are drivers - but I'm skeptical that all will come through - and in the meantime, Windows and disk-based Office revenues will continue to decline.The 150%-plus gain in MSFT stock has come in large part from the idea that Microsoft is in a different position than it was in 2012 or 2013. Then, investors were concerned about declining PC sales, and the lack of any real ability for MSFT to grow otherwise.Microsoft is in a better position now, but it's hardly perfect. PC concerns still remain; phones, cloud and notebooks are tough spaces and overall growth continue to be rather muted. There's enough here to expect some sort of EPS growth, which likely implies a high double-digit multiple. But that, in turn, implies a share price in the $50-$55 price range.That values Microsoft somewhere around $100 billion less than where it trades at the moment. If that sounds like a lot of money, bear in mind that Microsoft stock has added $300 billion in value over the past four years and essentially zero in net income.As of this writing, Vince Martin did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace7 Blue-Chip Stocks That Are Flush With CashThe 7 Best ETFs for Retirement Investors7 Best Stocks to Buy for a Donald Trump Green LightThe postMicrosoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock Is Worth About $100 Billion Too Muchappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Advanced Micro, Bethesda Partner to Better Gaming Experience;3/2/2017;"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.AMDstock has been a consistent performer over the last 12 months. While the ZacksElectronics - Semiconductorsindustry gained 70.8%, the stock appreciated a whopping 544.8%, primarily driven by strong adoption of its computing and graphics products.The company's products continue to gain rapid adoption, which has driven top-line growth in the recent past. AMD recently announced a long-term strategic partnership with Bethesda Softworks at the 2017 Game Developers Conference via the AMD ""Capsaicin"" webcast and press event.The objective of the partnership is to further game technology development and enhance the overall PC gaming experience.How is it Going to Help AMD?Bethesda Softworks has been in the gaming business for over 30 years now and has produced some popular games such asThe Elder Scrollsseries,DOOM,Fallout 3 and 4, Wolfenstein: The New Order,DishonoredandQuake,which taken together have sold more than 80 million copies worldwide.On the other hand, AMD's Central Processing Units (CPUs) and Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) have a great fan following in the gaming sphere.We note that, in the past, Vulkan a low-level Application Program Interface (API), was implemented in Bethesda Softworks'DOOMthat resulted in enhanced performance and improved graphics of the game that resulted in enhanced gaming experience.We believe that this kind of collaboration will improve demand for AMD's CPUs and GPUs among game software developers. Also, as Bethesda's games will be optimized for AMD chips it will be a win-win situation for both the companies to gain further traction in the gaming arena.As per a PwC report, total video games revenue is projected to reach $20.3 billion by 2020 that is growing at a CAGR of 3.6%. Given the huge opportunity the sector offers, AMD's move looks aptly timed and augurs well for the company in the long run.However, there is stiff competition in the gaming space with the presence of some major players such as NVIDIANVDAand MicrosoftMSFT. Nevertheless, we believe that increasing adoption of the company's products like Radeon and FirePro server GPUs will drive top-line growth going forward.Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

The Zacks analyst points to the company's continuing enterprise strength, benefits from the Office 365 subscription model, strong growth prospects of Azure and promising new products.The acquisition of AI startup Maluuba is a big positive for the company given the growing demand for artificial intelligence techniques throughout the world. The recent announcement of Xbox Game Pass, a subscription-based gaming service, will help Microsoft to win market share from the likes of GameStop. All in all, the company has emerged as a leader in the cloud space that promises momentum on a number of fronts. (You canread the full research report on Microsofthere.)Buy-ratedCanadian Nationalshares have done really well since the election (up +9.1%) and have also posted healthy gains last year, but failed to outperform the Zacks Rail industry which gained 19.7% over the same period. This was primarily due to coal related headwinds. However, fourth quarter earnings exceeded expectations, driven by lower costs, while revenues increased on a year-over-year basis.The analyst likes this Buy-rated stock's initiatives to reward investors as well as the C$2.5 billion 2017 capital investment plan. The plan complements its efforts to promote safety along with enhancing productivity.

The analyst is enthused by its latest announcement, that it expects the upstream and downstream segments to contribute significant cash flows over the next five years. Cash flows from the upstream operation will likely be between $13 billion and $14 billion annually.Moreover, the downstream operation is expected to add $9-$10 billion yearly cash flows. However, volatility in commodity prices remains a concern. Moreover, the trailing 12-month return on capital is not very encouraging.

Pure Storage (PSTG) Posts Narrower-than-Expected Q4 Loss;3/2/2017;"Pure Storage Inc.PSTGreported non-GAAP loss (including stock-based compensation) of 21 cents per share in the fourth-quarter of fiscal 2017, which was narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 cents.Excluding stock-based compensation, non-GAAP loss was a couple of cents narrower than loss of 12 cents reported in the year-ago quarter.Following the results, shares of the company were down 6.9% in after-hours trading. Also, we note that the shares of the company have underperformed the ZacksComputer- Storage Devicesindustry over the last one year. While the industry gained 44.7%, the stock declined 34.1%.The underperformance of the stock could be primarily attributed to an intensifying competitive landscape with the presence of major players such as Amazon'sAMZNAWS Microsoft'sMSFTAzure in the cloud storage and NetApp.Quarter DetailsPure Storage has two reportable segments namely,ProductandSupport.In the fourth quarter, Product revenues of $186.8 million surged 46.7% on a year-over-year basis, primarily driven by a record 450 customer additions and renewed business from existing customers.Support revenues of $41.0 million increased a whopping 79.4% on a year-over-year basis as a result of revenue recognition on ongoing support contracts.Total revenue was $227.9 million, which was up a significant 51.7% year over year and ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $224 million. Notably, 77% of the revenues came from the U.S. while the remaining 23% was contributed by other international markets taken together.During the quarter, Pure Storage added 450 new customers, bringing the total additions for the year to 1,400. We note that this takes the total count of Pure Storage's existing customer base to over 3,000, which includes over 100 of the Fortune 500 companies.Some notable companies that adopted Pure Storage's technology during the quarter were Hulu (streaming video service provider), Subway (restaurant chain), Royal Philips, Konami, Phreesia, National Hockey League, Keker Van Nest & Peters (law firm) and Ion (a geosciences company).Notably, the storage market is currently going through a rapid transition with more and more customers opting for cloud-capable storage for data integrity and predictive analytics. Hence,Pure Storage continues to focus on the All-Flash Array and cloud segments, which are in great demand and augur well for the company in the long run.Moreover, the company's end-to-end platforms such as FlashBlade and FlashArray as well as FlashStack which was developed in association with Cisco have been made cloud capable and are witnessing growing adoption rates.  Additionally, the company's NVNe Flash is capable of improving the performance and efficiency of organizations, which are likely to help improve Pure Storage's top line in the coming years.We also note that during the last quarter, the company replaced the traditional storage devices, which required 20 racks of spinning discs, for two of its customers with a single 4U FlashBlade, which is more compact and only the size of a microwave oven.With the passage of time, as technology becomes more and more developed, the space required to store data will shrink. Hence, Pure Storage's compact storage technology is likely to gain further traction in the future.Reported R&D expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased 390 basis points (bps) while reported sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased 290 bps. On the other hand, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased 320 bps.Non-GAAP gross margin was 66.1%, which expanded 10 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis.Non-GAAP operating loss was $4.4 million compared with a loss of $22.1 million in the year-ago quarter.Non-GAAP net loss came was $4.8 million that narrowed down from the year-ago loss of $22.3 million.Pure Storage, Inc.

3 Top Dividend Stocks to Buy Now;2/28/2017;"Despite the stock market's big run-up, shares inMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) ,UnitedHealth Group(NYSE: UNH) , andJohnson & Johnson(NYSE: JNJ) could still be heading higher. If so, investors savvy   enough to have added these three topdividend   stocksto their income portfolios could make out handsomely, because all   three companies have an opportunity to overdeliver on cash flow   and profit.A technology titan turning the cornerIt wasn't too many years ago that investors were shunningMicrosoft shares, fearful that a dying PC market would be the end to this   company's long winning streak. However, a portfolio of cloud   software products that are perfectly suited to today's   decentralized workplace has caught fire with companies of all   sizes, and that's rekindled interest in this technology   powerhouse.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.makeArticleAd();To be clear, the company's still got more work to do. The PC   business is still slowing, but next-generation solutions are   growing quickly, and because of their high margins, they're   providing profit-friendly tailwinds. Last quarter, the company's   personal computing segment revenue fell 5% from a year ago, but   that decline was offset by a 10% jump in productivity and   business processes sales to $7.4 billion and a 8% jump in   intelligent cloud segment sales. Productivity and business   processes growth was driven by 47% increase in Office   365 commercial revenue and 22% growth in Office consumer   products and cloud services revenue. Meanwhile, intelligent cloud   sales were driven by a 12% increase in server products and a   93% surge in revenue for Azure, its app development and   management business.Overall, growth in Microsoft's higher-margin businesses helped   the company deliver non GAAP net income of $6.5 billion and   non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.83, up 6% and 9% from a   year ago, respectively. That profit growth bodes well for   dividend investors because it means there's increasingly more   money available for dividend hikes. Currently, investors are   getting $0.39 per share in quarterly dividends, which works out   to a 2.4% dividend yield, at current share prices.Big changes could create big opportunityA huge amount of uncertainty exists in the health insurance   industry right now. Donald Trump's win last November means that a   repeal and replace of Obamacare is on deck, and while it's not   clear yet what the replacement will be, big insurers like   UnitedHealth Group, the nation's largest insurer, could be   rewarded.After losing hundreds of millions of dollars selling Obamacare   plans, UnitedHealth Group became one of Obamacare's biggest   critics. The company decided to exit most of the Affordable Care   Act's exchanges early last year, and in 2017, it only offered   plans in a handful of states, down from more than 30 states in   2016.Since UnitedHealth Group's already exited the majority of the   ACA states, a repeal is likely to be far less disruptive to it   than it is to competitors. The company's vast experience in   managing health insurance plans, however, means it's still one of   the best-positioned companies to profit from any Obamacare   replacement.Despite losing money on Obamacare in 2016, UnitedHealth Group   remains one of America's most financially healthy insurers.   Strength in its Medicaid, Medicare, and employer health insurance   businesses more than offset Obamacare headwinds last year, and as   a result, full-year operating profit jumped 20% to $13 billion   and adjusted earnings per share grew 25% to $8.05 in   2016.Assuming Congress replaces Obamacare with a more profitable   alternative, the potential for UnitedHealth Group to grow its   bottom line in the coming years is significant. But even if an   Obamacare replacement is a dud, UnitedHealth can still deliver   plenty of dividend-friendly bottom-line growth. Job growth is   boosting enrollment in its workplace insurance plans and aging   baby boomers offer tremendous growth for its Medicare Advantage   plans.A set-it and forget-it stockPerhaps, no company is more deeply tied to global healthcare   markets than Johnson & Johnson. Its over-the-counter brands   are some of the planet's most widely recognized, and its   pharmaceuticals and medical devices are among the most popular   choices of doctors worldwide.Consumer brands like Band-Aid keep cash flowing, offsetting   some risk to investors, while a prolific drug research and   development program fuels Johnson & Johnson's growth. For   example, it's fastest-growing drugs are the multiple myeloma drug   Darzalex and the leukemia drug Imbruvica. Darzalex sales soared   to $572 million from $20 million in its first full year on the   market. Meanwhile, Imbruvica's sales jumped 82% to $1.2 billion   in 2016 These two drugs are emblematic of Johnson & Johnson's   success at commercializing next-generation medicine.Granted, the drug industry is a hypercompetitive and expiring   patents means more competition is coming, but management has   decades of experience navigating patent risk, and with some of   the deepest pockets in the industry, I'm confident Johnson &   Johnson will innovate new drugs that help it sidestep its   competitors.Overall, if you want to own fast-growing dividend stocks in   your income portfolio, then there could be better options, but if   your goal is to own a steady-Eddy performer with an enviable   track record of dividend increases, then it's hard to argue   against buying Johnson & Johnson's stock.10 stocks we like better than Johnson and   JohnsonWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

GameStop (GME) Stock Tanks on Xbox Game Pass News;2/28/2017;"Shares of GameStopGMEdropped more than 8.5% in late afternoon trading Tuesday following the announcement of Xbox Game Pass, a subscription-based gaming service that stands to threaten the video game retailer's business model.Xbox Game Pass promises to be the Netflix (NFLX) of the gaming world, giving users access to a library of on-demand games for just a $10 per month subscription. The service will launch later this spring with over 100 Xbox and Xbox 360 games available to play and download on the Xbox One.Although MicrosoftMSFT, the developer of the Xbox brand, has yet to release a full list of available titles, ateaser pagefor Game Pass includes games likeHalo 5,Fable III,Gears of War: Ultimate Edition, andNBA 2k16.(Also Read:3 Video Game Stocks to Buy Right Now)GameStop is feeling the effects of the announcement because a subscription-based service like Game Pass seriously threatens its business model. In a world where most new games can already be downloaded straight to the console, one of GameStop's only remaining appeals is its used game library.Each individual GameStop store has its own selection of used games, and this works perfectly for gamers looking for playable, recent-but-outdated titles. If you can access all of these games through a $10 a month subscription, why even bother heading into a GameStop store?What's worse is that Xbox Game Pass is likely just one of the first steps in the industry-wide acceptance of subscription services. SonySNEalready has its PlayStation Now service, which allows PS4 users to stream PS3 games, but now Microsoft has joined the fray and upped the ante by giving gamers the ability to download from its library.A Full-Blown Technological Breakthrough in the   MakingZacks' Aggressive Growth Strategist Brian Bolan explores autonomous cars in our latest Special Report, Driverless Cars: Your Roadmap to Mega-Profits Today.

Why Shares of GameStop Dropped Today;2/28/2017;"What happenedShares of video game retailerGameStop(NYSE: GME) slumped on Tuesday afterMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) announced a subscription service that gives Xbox   One owners full access to over 100 older games. The potential for   this service to hurt sales of both new and used physical game   discs sent GameStop stock down 10% by 2:45 p.m. EST on   Tuesday.So whatXbox Game Pass is set to launch this spring. The subscription   service will cost $9.99 per month and give gamers the ability to   download more than 100 Xbox One and backward-compatible Xbox 360   games. The catalog of games available will change month to month,   but subscribers will be able to purchase any game in the catalog   at a 20% discount to the retail price.Image source: Microsoft.makeArticleAd();This new subscription service from Microsoft has the potential   to depress physical game sales, which is bad news for GameStop.   During the third quarter, GameStop generated 31.5% of its revenue   from new game sales and 24% of its revenue from used and value   game sales. Used and value games are a big cash cow for GameStop,   with the category's gross margin nearly double that of new   games.Used and value game sales may end up being the hardest hit if   Xbox Game Pass is a success, which would take a big bite out of   GameStop's bottom line. It could also triggerSonyto launch a similar service in the future. Sony already offers   PlayStation Now, which streams games from the cloud, but being   able to download games directly side-steps the issues inherent in   that approach.Now whatGameStop has been diversifying beyond physical games in an   effort to survive in a world where console games are increasingly   going digital. The company sells digital games as well as   electronics and collectibles, which collectively generated nearly   20% of revenue during the third quarter, but GameStop remains   heavily dependent on physical game sales.Xbox Game Pass represents another step on the way toconsole games going completely digital. GameStop's vast store base is supported by physical game sales,   so any shift toward digital games is ultimately bad for the   company.10 stocks we like better than GameStopWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Amazon To Sell Gaming Content On Subsidiary Twitch;2/28/2017;"AmazonAMZNacquired video game streaming company Twitch in 2014 for $1 billion and the online retailer is now looking to further capitalize on the $100 billion video gaming industry.Twitch is a platform similar to YouTube where video game fans can watch their favorite games being played live by other video-gamers; an added form of interaction is available through the options of commenting and posing questions on the site.When the deal took place, it raised eyebrows. Not many understood Amazon's intentions of having Twitch's services as a subsidiary. The move is now clear.Coming this spring, games and game features will be available for purchase right on Twitch's site. Games from companies such as UbisoftUBSFYand Telltale Games will be available. However higher profile developers, such as Electronic ArtsEAand ActivisionATVI, will be missing.The incentive is a double-edged sword, as Amazon will get a 25% cut of content sold and the streamer, who is the person playing the game, will get a 5% cut.Amazon views this platform as a way to compete with game consoles such as Microsoft'sMSFTXbox and Sony'sSNEPlayStation. However, the prominent revenue stream for PC games is different than consoles. On PCs, leading revenue is generated from game features rather than the game itself. Features include add-ons which enhance gaming experience.Twitch's vice president of commerce, Matt McCloskey, hopes the site's 10 million daily viewers will be encouraged to purchase content while viewing their favorite gamers play. He stated, ""Ultimately, the principle is if you can watch it on Twitch, you can buy it on Twitch.""A Full-Blown Technological Breakthrough in the   MakingZacks' Aggressive Growth Strategist Brian Bolan explores autonomous cars in our latest Special Report, Driverless Cars: Your Roadmap to Mega-Profits Today.

Facebook Inc's Chatbots Hit a 70% Failure Rate;2/28/2017;"Facebook(NASDAQ: FB) is reportedly scaling back its chatbot efforts on   Messenger after the programs failed to fulfill 70% of users'   requests.The Informationreports that those requests couldn't be handled without human   agents, and bots built by outside developers ""had issues"" because   the ""technology to understand human requests wasn't developed   enough.""So instead of building a large ecosystem of chatbots, Facebook   will train Messenger bots to handle ""a narrower set of cases, so   users aren't disappointed by the limitations of automation.""   Let's see what this strategic shift means for Facebook's AI   efforts, and whether or not chatbots will ever become meaningful   tools for the social network.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();Understanding Facebook's AI strategyArtificial intelligence plays a vital role in helping Facebook   track users and deliver targeted ads. By using AI to scan a   user's status updates, photos, videos, check-ins, likes, linked   apps, and other data, Facebook generates digital profiles of   users which help it deliver targeted ads to their News Feeds. In   2013, Facebook launched the FAIR (Facebook Artificial   Intelligence Research) unit to continuously upgrade those AI   capabilities.That's where Messenger comes in. In 2014, Facebook forced   users to download the stand-alone Messenger app to keep chatting.   That move -- whichclearly mirroredTencent's(NASDAQOTH: TCEHY) WeChat -- laid the foundations for Messenger   to become a ""platform"" which could eventually offer ride hailing,   mobile payments, deliveries, games and other services from a   single app.Facebook's Messenger app. Image source: Google Play.That move would give Facebook an ""OS within an OS"" to counter   the iOS App Store andAlphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google Play. Facebook's next   step would be toreplaceapps with Messenger chatbots, which were introduced last April.   If that effort works, it could turn the entire mobile app store   model upside down.The premature rise of the chatbotsIn theory, a business chatbot could answer questions, make   purchase suggestions, process orders, and send shipping updates   to customers. For customers, having ""conversations"" with these   bots would feel more natural than scrolling and clicking through   a mobile app. Companies could  also cut costs by reducing   the number of human customer service representatives.Facebook tethers those bots to Messenger for Business, which   provides a live customer service chat channel for a large number   of businesses. Businesses can choose to put a human or a chatbot   to handle queries on their end. This idea attracted a lot of   early adopters -- 30,000 Facebook bots were already active on   Messenger as of last September.But just as Google struggled with low-quality apps over the   years, Facebook's ecosystem quickly became bogged down with   poorly produced chatbots. Badly made bots could annoy customers   and tarnish a company's image -- so the company decided it's a   better idea to send the bots back to the drawing board than   expand the overall ecosystem.Facebook should've seen this comingThe limitations of AI-powered bots were already clear when   Facebook launched its chatbot APIs last year. For example,Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) launched its chatbot Tay onTwitteras an experimentlast March. Within 24 hours, Tay started tweeting racist and   sexist comments, forcing Microsoft to abruptly pull the plug and   issue an  apology. Tencent has also struggled to  purge   spam and scam bots on WeChat since it started letting millions of   accounts create their own bots.Facebook's AI tech also wasn't that impressive prior to the   arrival of its chatbots. Its News Feed struggled to discern fake   news headlines from real ones, and its Messenger-based virtual   assistant M hasn't gained much  ground against Google Now or   Siri.Edison Investment analyst Richard Windsor -- who    recently called Facebook a ""laggard in AI"" compared to   Google -- stated that ""when Facebook tries to automate its   systems, things always go wrong."" He also pointed out that while   Facebook has hired plenty of AI talent, it simply hasn't been   working on AI ""for nearly long enough"" to challenge market   leaders like Google.So what's next for Facebook's AI efforts?Despite those missteps, Facebook probably won't stop investing   in chatbots anytime soon. The company is expected to introduce   new AI plans at its F8 conference in April, which will likely   include ways to boost the quality, not quantity, of its Messenger   bots. It could also introduce more ways to tether bots into other   Messenger features -- like payments and games -- to increase the   app's appeal as a stand-alone platform.10 stocks we like better than FacebookWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Alphabet Suing Uber Over Self-Driving Car Technology;2/28/2017;"Uber badly needed self-driving car technology because it was in danger of getting pushed out of the market if many cheaper ride-hailing services using self-driving technology (no human driver) were to enter the market. So it assumed a not-so-honest way of getting it. That's what AlphabetGOOGLis claiming after discovering the theft of its technology by a former Googler.The Technology in QuestionGoogle has for long held that its technology, which includes hardware and software components, is superior to others. The company, which originally used LiDAR based systems from Velodyne, later developed a number of such systems for close-range, mid-range and long-range ""vision"" of self-driving cars. These systems generate millions of laser images per second that offer a much clearer picture of the area surrounding the car and helps it take more accurate decisions.Additionally, the company recently announced that it had devised a more economical system that would take its cost from $75,000, to $7,500, thus making it commercially viable.The AccusedAnthony Levandowskihas been accused of downloading 14,000 highly confidential files (9.7GB of data), including Waymo's LiDAR circuit board designs to an external disk drive using specialized software. He then downloaded a new OS to his company-supplied laptop that effectively deleted information, in a rather elaborate attempt to erase his activity. Strangely, Levandowski didn't use the laptop much after the new OS was installed.After quitting Google, Levandowski set up a self-driving trucking company calledOtto, wooing fifteen other Waymo engineers, who brought additional supplier lists, manufacturing details and other trade secrets.Otto quickly sold itself toUberfor $680 million.Uber's ResponseUber remains partners with Google for other technology despite their increased competition on the self-driving front. As an initial response, a Uber representative said, ""We take the allegations made against Otto and Uber employees seriously and we will review this matter carefully.""Later, this changed to: ""We are incredibly proud of the progress that our team has made… We have reviewed Waymo's claims and determined them to be a baseless attempt to slow down a competitor and we look forward to vigorously defending against them in court. In the meantime, we will continue our hard work to bring self-driving benefits to the world.""Other DetailsThe discovery of theft was intriguing: A Uber supplier had inadvertently copied a Google executive in a mail titled ""Otto files."" The mail was being sent to people at Uber that Google thinks were involved with Uber's self-driving technology.Google found that the replicated technology, the diagrams of which were attached to the email, bore a close resemblance to its proprietary technology and was based on Waymo trade secrets. ""Moreover, the Replicated Board is specifically designed to be used in conjunction with many other Waymo trade secrets and in the context of overall LiDAR systems covered by Waymo patents,"" the complaint reads.Upon inquiry with the Nevada Governor's Office of Economic Development and Department of Motor Vehicles, it was found that Uber said its technology was internally developed.The Big PictureAs a Bloomberg report points out, Levandowski didn't start out at Google. He has been working on autonomous vehicles for some time, founding a startup called 510 systems in 2001 that he later sold to Google. The technology this startup brought is the foundation of Google's technology.At the end of the day, engineers do like to move around because it's more profitable and allows them liberties that aren't available for sticking around at a big corporate house like Google. This is neither the first nor last time companies have whisked away people from competitors. All the major tech companies including Google itself, MicrosoftMSFT, FacebookFB, TwitterTWTR, AppleAAPL, you name it, have done likewise.Engineers are the life blood of companies like Google while on the other hand, the big companies are the only ones that can make engineers rich.

Up 620%, What's Happening With Advanced Micro Devices Stock?;2/28/2017;"Unless you closely follow the stock, you probably had no idea   shares ofAdvanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD) are up a gaudy 620% since March 2016 in the last 12   months. That is not a typo.makeArticleAd();AMDdata byYCharts.The ongoing rally in AMD shares has been perhaps one of the   least discussed but most impressive investing storylines in tech   in the past year. In fact, AMD's share-price surge is about three   times larger than the incredible run inNVIDIAstock over the last year. So what's driving this wild, newfound   bullishness in AMD stock? Let's take a look.Understanding AMD's stock rallyAMD's business has enjoyed something of a turnaround in recent   quarters. After seeing sales fall for seven consecutive quarters,   AMD has produced positive sales growth in each of its three most   recent quarters. Investors anticipate company-specific and   industrywide trends will allow AMD to expand its business   presence in each of its two core operating segments in the years   to come.On the gaming side of its business,MicrosoftandSonywill each refresh their respective consoles in the coming years   to enable next-generation graphic capabilities like 4K video   quality and virtual reality (VR) gaming. AMD is the main supplier   of semi-customer system-on-a-chip (SOC) for both Microsoft's Xbox   and Sony's Playstation gaming consoles; Sony and Microsoft each   consistently account for more than 10% of AMD's annual sales.. Microsoft has already announced its latest Xbox iteration,   dubbed Project Scorpio, which will arrive in time for the 2017   holiday season. Sony has yet to announce its response to Scorpio,   but major console releases tend to closely follow one another.   Many industry observers believe this new upgrade cycle will   create a corresponding surge in new revenue for AMD that will   help extend its current sales growth momentum.In its computing and graphics unit, AMD should enjoy an   opportunity to catch up withIntel(NASDAQ: INTC) in CPUs and NVIDIA in GPUs to a certain   extent. AMD's forthcoming 14 nm Ryzen CPUs, due to launch by   March, offer more powerful performance than Intel's i7 chips.   Similarly, AMD's Vega chips appear to be a legitimate challenger   to NVIDIA's GeForce high-end gaming GPUs. So there's certainly a   fair case to be made that sales  will indeed   improve at AMD in the coming year.All of this is to say that things are generally looking up at   AMD. At the same time though, a few important points cause me to   question whether its rally can continue.Image source: Getty Images.How much is too much?Though business conditions are indeed improving at AMD, it   isn't as clear that this longtime ugly duckling has permanently   transformed into a swan, for a few reasons.A key piece of AMD's bull thesis is that its current 14 nm Zen   server chips have closed the gap with Intel's 14 nm Broadwell   server microprocessors this year, largely the result of Intel's   decision to not shift its CPUs to a 10 nm die shrink, codenamed   Cannonlake, until the second half of 2017. Bullish analysts see   AMD catching Intel at the 14 nm level as creating a window for it   to steal server market share from Intel, which indeed seems   plausible. However, with Intel moving to 10 nm by the latter half   of this year, AMD's parity with Intel server chips seems likely   to be short-lived, making this large market-share gain difficult   to sustain.Equally important, it isn't necessarily clear whether   meaningful sales growth will translate into actual profits for   AMD and its investors. Though the company has gone through two   separate cost-structure overhauls, in 2014 and 2015, its margin   structure has continued to deteriorate. For example, its gross   margins fell from 27% in 2015 to 23% in 2016, even as it saw its   revenue increase 12%. This suggests AMD's business model lacks   the kind ofoperating leveragethat could allow it to quickly return to profitability if sales   continue to rise.In a nutshell, ongoing success is by no means assured at AMD.   The company has done an admirable job capitalizing on its various   opportunities in recent years. However, as we saw above, several   structural reasons exist that may make it difficult to sustain   this kind of success over the long term.10 stocks we like better than Advanced Micro   DevicesWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Is Bitcoin Finally a Serious Currency -- or Maybe Even a Solid Investment Vehicle?;2/27/2017;"The computer-driven currency known as Bitcoin has been through   a few rough years. After peaking at $1,216 per Bitcoin at the end   of 2013, conversion prices plunged all the way to $200 in just 16   months. Today, Bitcoin values have surged back above $1,100 and   might set fresh all-time highs someday soon.The Bitcoin boom in 2013 turned into a total rout. Is the   currency headed for another meltdown, or should you take Bitcoin   more seriously this time around?Chart source:Bitcoin Charts. License:Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0makeArticleAd();What was the problem last time?Four years ago, Bitcoin found itself in a global spotlight.   Having started as a hobby project in 2009, the crypto-currency   had surged from ""basically worthless"" to a value of hundreds of   dollars per currency unit. Investors, speculators, and downright   gamblers were trying to find ways to profit from this new thing.   On the back end, hobbyists gave way to serious number-crunchers   who used special math-processing chips to process the   exponentially increasing number of bitcoin blocks.What followed was a series of scandals. Critics called the   Bitcoin increase a ""bubble,"" undermining trust in the currency.   Perception is reality, or at least a significant part of the real   value in tradeable assets that aren't backed by gold reserves orgovernmental guarantees.So Bitcoin prices started falling. The crash accelerated when   a currency exchange known as Mt. Gox declared bankruptcy and shut   down while managing some 70% of all Bitcoin transactions   worldwide. The CEO of that exchange was later arrested and   charged with embezzling $390 million from the service. Other   exchanges shut their doors or suffered hacking attacks, often   with a side of insider embezzling charges. Each embarrassment   sparked another selling spree, andBitcoin values plungedon heavy trading volumes.Image source: the Bitcoin Symbol project, under theFree Art License 1.3.So, what's different now?I could argue that the crash that started in 2014 was a   necessary evil. It shook out several weak hands from the Bitcoin   game, cementing a new set of leading trade exchanges and a   heightened sense of security threats. We probably haven't seen   the last Bitcoin embezzling scandal yet, but then again, no other   currency is entirely free from misuse and occasional   scandals.More importantly, businesses and government regulators have   started to treat Bitcoin as a serious and valuable resource.Goldman Sachs(NYSE: GS) has invested millions in a Bitcoin transaction manager   in the hope of making money on the transactional side of this   thing. Other banks and financial powerhouses are planning to   introduce Bitcoin-based exchange-traded funds at some point,   assuming that the SEC would approve this idea.The major credit card issuers may not be working Bitcoin   itself into their services, but they are thinking hard about how   to leverage Bitcoin-like technologies to improve their   transaction management. That's not a long step away from tapping   into the Bitcoin market directly.Elsewhere, you can use Bitcoin to pay for an increasing   collection of real-world products and services.Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) accepts it as payment for digital content and   games in the online stores for Windows, Xbox Games, Xbox Music,   and more. Want to subscribe toSports Illustrated,Time, orFood & Wine?Time(NYSE: TIME) takes Bitcoin as payment for magazine subscriptions.   Computer hardware seller Newegg not only accepts the   currency but also offered a 10% discount for   Bitcoin-financed purchases for a while. And the list goes on.Most of these retailers haven't quite elevated Bitcoin to the   full status of a real currency, like dollars or euros. It's more   like a new type of gift card at this point, managed by somebody   else. Returns on Bitcoin-financed purchases are typically given   in the form of store credit -- or not at all. But even so, these   are votes of confidence in the Bitcoin system, and these   companies seem interested in riding or even shaping the wave of   bringing it into common usage.The big takeawayYes, things really are different this time.Bitcoin is still not quite as dependable as gold bullion or a   roll of dollar bills, and not as useful in day-to-day use as cash   or credit cards. But it's much closer to that status than it was   a few years ago. Assuming that the biggest and nastiest back-end   scandals have already been dealt with, the next couple of years   should see fewer massive value drops and a more stable Bitcoin   value in general.You shouldn't pour your life savings into Bitcoin buys, of   course. The risks may be smaller now, but they still can't be   forgotten. Andcurrency trading is not a serious investmentin the first place -- even if you're limiting your moves to   respected world currencies like the dollar, the yuan, and the   euro.But a little bit of Bitcoin exposure could be useful and   instructive nowadays. I have a tiny bit of skin in the game   myself, having bought roughly one-fifth of a Bitcoin when it was   cheap two years ago. The value of that tiny position has   increased fivefold, even as I've used the funds for sending   donations to Wikimedia and other online services. Not making me   rich by any means, but it's enough to keep me interested and   informed.10 stocks we like better than MicrosoftWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Microsoft’s Productivity Segment and AWS Share a Common Characteristic;2/27/2017;"Microsoft Corp.(MSFT) has been on a steady march towards revenue growth as the company has smartly turned its focus toward multiple product lines and cloud, while slowly pushing Windows to the back burner. The technology giant has created a solid portfolio of products that it sells using the as-a-service cloud-delivered model.The company's push into the enterprise software segment is built around Office 365, which is part of the Productivity and Business Processes segment. Although we do not exactly know how much its IaaS offering Azure brings in, recent estimates suggest it could be around $2.7 billion dollars in 2016. If that assumption is true, then a large bulk of its cloud revenue is coming from SaaS products because the annualized commercial cloud run rate crossed $14 billion during the most recent quarter.Considering the rate at which Office 365 has been growing, it is not really a surprise that the SaaS lineup is bringing in revenues in the billions. Office 365 commercial revenue has been growing above 50% for the past several quarters, with the latest quarter growth coming in at 47%. Dynamics 365, Microsoft's product to address the growing ERP and CRM segment, also witnessed 9% revenue growth during the second quarter.makeArticleAd();Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes grew 10% during the second quarter to reach $7.4 billion. More than the revenue growth rate, Microsoft's management must be extremely happy with the margin levels offered by the productivity segment. During the second quarter, the segment reported an operating income of $3.256 billion with an eye-popping margin of 44.10%, while the margin for the first two quarters was 45.41%.Source: MicrosoftQ2-17Press ReleaseThe software segment is inherently a high-margin business, but above 40% margins is not something you come across often. It shows the pricing power Microsoft has and is a clear sign it is at the top of the segment. Even if the competition were to catch up to it, Microsoft has plenty of room to move in the event of a price war.Microsoft's SaaS office collaboration products are possibly in the same position asAmazon(AMZN) Web Services' products in the IaaS world - way ahead of the rest of the pack.Office 365 and AWS both have the size and scale of multibillion-dollar businesses, but they still keep adding service after service to their offerings, making it extremely difficult for the competition to enter the market, let alone play catch-up.It is not easy to drag either unit into a price war because they both enjoy the fattest margins possible. Moreover, it is not easy to create a better product because they are relentless in expanding existing functionality and enhancing performance, all while continuously keeping a finger on the pulse of pricing.Both companies have no reason to slow down and should continue to enjoy robust growth in their respective segments. One has a very strong enterprise productivity business, while the other has a fast-growing IaaS unit.If you are watching Microsoft and Amazon, these two segments should get as much attention from you as their core businesses of software and retail.Disclosure:I have no positions in the stock mentioned above and no intention to initiate a position in the next 72 hours.Start afree 7-day trial of Premium Membershipto GuruFocus.IJR 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of IJRPeter Lynch Chart of IJRPremium MembersThis article first appeared onGuruFocus."

The 5 Best Dividend Stocks for Beginning Investors;2/27/2017;"According toFinviz.com, there are currently more than 3,500 publicly traded stocks that   pay a dividend. That's an overwhelming number that can make it   difficult for a new investor to get started.To help you narrow down your selection, we asked a team of   Fools to each pick a stock they think is a great choice for a   beginner. They chooseWaste Management(NYSE: WM) ,Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) ,American Express(NYSE: AXP) ,Cisco Systems(NASDAQ: CSCO) , andCostco(NASDAQ: COST) . Read on to find out why.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();The benefits of buying disruption-proof     businessesTyler Crowe(Waste Management):One of the things beginning investors should learn when making   their first dividend investment is how to identify companies in   essential functions of our everyday lives with nearly   insurmountable competitive advantages over their competition.   These are the kinds of companies that will have the pricing power   to grow revenue and profits for decades to come, and return   considerable value to shareholders.One company that fits this mold incredibly well is refuse   handler Waste Management. The company is the largest refuse   collection company, and it has a large network of landfills,   disposal centers, and recycling facilities across the U.S. The   waste-handling business inherently has lots of competitive   advantages for its well-established players. It's extremely   capital-intensive to build out a fleet of waste collection   vehicles, there are lots of regulatory hurdles involved in   opening new landfills and maintaining existing ones, and it's   extremely difficult to disrupt how humans generate and handle   waste. These things combine to give Waste Management a very   favorable operating environment where it can pass along rising   costs to customers pretty easily and generate a steady stream of   profits.For years, Waste Management has taken these competitive   advantages and turned them into a very shareholder-friendly   business. For more than a decade, the company has steadily raised   its dividend payments and bought back shares to generate high   rates of return in what many would consider a slow-growth   business.WM Return on Equity (TTM)data byYCharts.For beginning investors, companies with huge competitive   advantages like Waste Management are a great lesson in why it   pays to hang onto stocks for the long term. The company's share   price gains will never blow anyone's socks off, but its high   rates of return in an industry that will likely be around for   decades will reward those who hold onto their position.The transition is workingBrian Feroldi(Microsoft):I'm a firm believer that new dividend investors should seek out   big, highly profitable companies for their first investment. That   criteria perfectly describes Microsoft, which is why I think it's   a fantastic stock for beginners.Microsoft has been cranking out profits for decades thanks to   its stranglehold on the software industry. Products such as   Windows and Office are cash cows that have been a dependable   source of revenue for decades. That should hold true for a long   time to come.However, Microsoft's stock stagnated for years over worries   that the ever-changing tech world would render this company's   products obsolete. Thankfully, that worry got put to rest when   Satya Nadella took over the top chair in 2014. CEO Nadella   has placed an emphasis on moving Microsoft's products into the   cloud, a decision that's paying off handsomely as revenue from   products like Azure, Office 365, and Dynamics CRM Online are   surging. When you add in the growth of other product lines such   as Xbox, Bing, and Surface, Microsoft's bottom line has been   posting healthy gains in recent years.Looking ahead, market watchers believe Microsoft's bottom line   will grow by more than 9% annually over the next five years. That   seems realistic when combining the growth in cloud product sales   with its recently completed acquisition of LinkedIn. Add to that   the company's rock-solid dividend yield of 2.4%, and I can't help   but think Microsoft is a terrific stock for new dividend   investors to buy.Buy one of Buffett's favorites at a great valueJasonHall(American Express):Warren Buffett first bought shares of American Express when the   company's stock was selling for bargain prices. Decades later,   those shares are worth almost 10 times whatBerkshire Hathawaypaid -- but that's only the tip of the iceberg of what American   Express means for Buffett and Berkshire today.At the current $0.32 per share quarterly dividend, American   Express will pay Berkshire almost $195 million in dividends in   2017. That may seem like a paltry yield on its $12 billion stake,   but when we look at the yield on cost -- that is, how much   American Express' dividend pays based on the original investment   -- the math is much better: Berkshire gets paid a roughly 15%   yield on its cost for those AmEx shares. And with its prospects   and track record, that payout is likely to keep growing for years   to come.There's a wonderful lesson for beginning investors: Don't skip   the small-yielding stocks if you're looking for dividends.   Sometimes your best choice is one like American Express, which   has spent far more time yielding below 2% of its market price   than above 3%, but it has steadily and regularly raised its   dividend for decades:AXP Dividenddata byYCharts.Don't let today's paltry yield cause you to miss an excellent   dividend growth stock. American Express stock is cheap today,   trading near 14 times last year's earnings. And with its track   record of dividend growth, it could be paying you 15% or more on   your original investment in a couple of decades.The company at the core of our digital worldChuck Saletta(Cisco Systems):Cisco is the ubiquitous networking giant responsible for many of   the high-speed routers and switches that move financial   transactions, videos, pictures, and text all over the internet.   It's also establishing itself as a strong dividend player with   both a decent history of increasing its dividend and reasonable   room to continue raising it going forward. That combination sets   it up as a great potential investment for someone just now   dipping into the realm of dividend investing.Cisco paid its first dividend of $0.06 per share per quarter   in 2011, and it has been increasing it since then. The company's   current yield is almost 3.5%, which is a decent premium over   the general market. It recently raised its dividend from $0.26   per share per quarter to $0.29, an increase of 11.5%. Even with   that increase, Cisco pays out only around half of its earnings in   the form of dividends, which gives it room to continue increasing   those dividends as its business grows over time.Speaking of that growth, over the next five years, analysts   expect Cisco to be able to increase its earnings by almost 11%   per year. If it does manage to grow at that pace, and its   dividends follow suit, investors will receive around $0.48 per   share per quarter five years from now. That's the true power of a   strong dividend investing strategy.Learn from a greatJordan Wathen(Costco):Warehouse retailer Costco is neither cheap nor especially   high-yielding, but it is the kind of company I'd recommend to a   friend as a company to follow and learn from.Costco has more traits of the ""greats"" than perhaps any other   company.

Is Bitcoin Finally a Serious Currency -- or Maybe Even a Solid Investment Vehicle?;2/27/2017;"The computer-driven currency known as Bitcoin has been through   a few rough years. After peaking at $1,216 per Bitcoin at the end   of 2013, conversion prices plunged all the way to $200 in just 16   months. Today, Bitcoin values have surged back above $1,100 and   might set fresh all-time highs someday soon.The Bitcoin boom in 2013 turned into a total rout. Is the   currency headed for another meltdown, or should you take Bitcoin   more seriously this time around?Chart source:Bitcoin Charts. License:Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0makeArticleAd();What was the problem last time?Four years ago, Bitcoin found itself in a global spotlight.   Having started as a hobby project in 2009, the crypto-currency   had surged from ""basically worthless"" to a value of hundreds of   dollars per currency unit. Investors, speculators, and downright   gamblers were trying to find ways to profit from this new thing.   On the back end, hobbyists gave way to serious number-crunchers   who used special math-processing chips to process the   exponentially increasing number of bitcoin blocks.What followed was a series of scandals. Critics called the   Bitcoin increase a ""bubble,"" undermining trust in the currency.   Perception is reality, or at least a significant part of the real   value in tradeable assets that aren't backed by gold reserves orgovernmental guarantees.So Bitcoin prices started falling. The crash accelerated when   a currency exchange known as Mt. Gox declared bankruptcy and shut   down while managing some 70% of all Bitcoin transactions   worldwide. The CEO of that exchange was later arrested and   charged with embezzling $390 million from the service. Other   exchanges shut their doors or suffered hacking attacks, often   with a side of insider embezzling charges. Each embarrassment   sparked another selling spree, andBitcoin values plungedon heavy trading volumes.Image source: the Bitcoin Symbol project, under theFree Art License 1.3.So, what's different now?I could argue that the crash that started in 2014 was a   necessary evil. It shook out several weak hands from the Bitcoin   game, cementing a new set of leading trade exchanges and a   heightened sense of security threats. We probably haven't seen   the last Bitcoin embezzling scandal yet, but then again, no other   currency is entirely free from misuse and occasional   scandals.More importantly, businesses and government regulators have   started to treat Bitcoin as a serious and valuable resource.Goldman Sachs(NYSE: GS) has invested millions in a Bitcoin transaction manager   in the hope of making money on the transactional side of this   thing. Other banks and financial powerhouses are planning to   introduce Bitcoin-based exchange-traded funds at some point,   assuming that the SEC would approve this idea.The major credit card issuers may not be working Bitcoin   itself into their services, but they are thinking hard about how   to leverage Bitcoin-like technologies to improve their   transaction management. That's not a long step away from tapping   into the Bitcoin market directly.Elsewhere, you can use Bitcoin to pay for an increasing   collection of real-world products and services.Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) accepts it as payment for digital content and   games in the online stores for Windows, Xbox Games, Xbox Music,   and more. Want to subscribe toSports Illustrated,Time, orFood & Wine?Time(NYSE: TIME) takes Bitcoin as payment for magazine subscriptions.   Computer hardware seller Newegg not only accepts the   currency but also offered a 10% discount for   Bitcoin-financed purchases for a while. And the list goes on.Most of these retailers haven't quite elevated Bitcoin to the   full status of a real currency, like dollars or euros. It's more   like a new type of gift card at this point, managed by somebody   else. Returns on Bitcoin-financed purchases are typically given   in the form of store credit -- or not at all. But even so, these   are votes of confidence in the Bitcoin system, and these   companies seem interested in riding or even shaping the wave of   bringing it into common usage.The big takeawayYes, things really are different this time.Bitcoin is still not quite as dependable as gold bullion or a   roll of dollar bills, and not as useful in day-to-day use as cash   or credit cards. But it's much closer to that status than it was   a few years ago. Assuming that the biggest and nastiest back-end   scandals have already been dealt with, the next couple of years   should see fewer massive value drops and a more stable Bitcoin   value in general.You shouldn't pour your life savings into Bitcoin buys, of   course. The risks may be smaller now, but they still can't be   forgotten. Andcurrency trading is not a serious investmentin the first place -- even if you're limiting your moves to   respected world currencies like the dollar, the yuan, and the   euro.But a little bit of Bitcoin exposure could be useful and   instructive nowadays. I have a tiny bit of skin in the game   myself, having bought roughly one-fifth of a Bitcoin when it was   cheap two years ago. The value of that tiny position has   increased fivefold, even as I've used the funds for sending   donations to Wikimedia and other online services. Not making me   rich by any means, but it's enough to keep me interested and   informed.10 stocks we like better than MicrosoftWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Microsoft’s Productivity Segment and AWS Share a Common Characteristic;2/27/2017;"Microsoft Corp.(MSFT) has been on a steady march towards revenue growth as the company has smartly turned its focus toward multiple product lines and cloud, while slowly pushing Windows to the back burner. The technology giant has created a solid portfolio of products that it sells using the as-a-service cloud-delivered model.The company's push into the enterprise software segment is built around Office 365, which is part of the Productivity and Business Processes segment. Although we do not exactly know how much its IaaS offering Azure brings in, recent estimates suggest it could be around $2.7 billion dollars in 2016. If that assumption is true, then a large bulk of its cloud revenue is coming from SaaS products because the annualized commercial cloud run rate crossed $14 billion during the most recent quarter.Considering the rate at which Office 365 has been growing, it is not really a surprise that the SaaS lineup is bringing in revenues in the billions. Office 365 commercial revenue has been growing above 50% for the past several quarters, with the latest quarter growth coming in at 47%. Dynamics 365, Microsoft's product to address the growing ERP and CRM segment, also witnessed 9% revenue growth during the second quarter.makeArticleAd();Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes grew 10% during the second quarter to reach $7.4 billion. More than the revenue growth rate, Microsoft's management must be extremely happy with the margin levels offered by the productivity segment. During the second quarter, the segment reported an operating income of $3.256 billion with an eye-popping margin of 44.10%, while the margin for the first two quarters was 45.41%.Source: MicrosoftQ2-17Press ReleaseThe software segment is inherently a high-margin business, but above 40% margins is not something you come across often. It shows the pricing power Microsoft has and is a clear sign it is at the top of the segment. Even if the competition were to catch up to it, Microsoft has plenty of room to move in the event of a price war.Microsoft's SaaS office collaboration products are possibly in the same position asAmazon(AMZN) Web Services' products in the IaaS world - way ahead of the rest of the pack.Office 365 and AWS both have the size and scale of multibillion-dollar businesses, but they still keep adding service after service to their offerings, making it extremely difficult for the competition to enter the market, let alone play catch-up.It is not easy to drag either unit into a price war because they both enjoy the fattest margins possible. Moreover, it is not easy to create a better product because they are relentless in expanding existing functionality and enhancing performance, all while continuously keeping a finger on the pulse of pricing.Both companies have no reason to slow down and should continue to enjoy robust growth in their respective segments. One has a very strong enterprise productivity business, while the other has a fast-growing IaaS unit.If you are watching Microsoft and Amazon, these two segments should get as much attention from you as their core businesses of software and retail.Disclosure:I have no positions in the stock mentioned above and no intention to initiate a position in the next 72 hours.Start afree 7-day trial of Premium Membershipto GuruFocus.IJR 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of IJRPeter Lynch Chart of IJRPremium MembersThis article first appeared onGuruFocus."

The 5 Best Dividend Stocks for Beginning Investors;2/27/2017;"According toFinviz.com, there are currently more than 3,500 publicly traded stocks that   pay a dividend. That's an overwhelming number that can make it   difficult for a new investor to get started.To help you narrow down your selection, we asked a team of   Fools to each pick a stock they think is a great choice for a   beginner. They chooseWaste Management(NYSE: WM) ,Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) ,American Express(NYSE: AXP) ,Cisco Systems(NASDAQ: CSCO) , andCostco(NASDAQ: COST) . Read on to find out why.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();The benefits of buying disruption-proof     businessesTyler Crowe(Waste Management):One of the things beginning investors should learn when making   their first dividend investment is how to identify companies in   essential functions of our everyday lives with nearly   insurmountable competitive advantages over their competition.   These are the kinds of companies that will have the pricing power   to grow revenue and profits for decades to come, and return   considerable value to shareholders.One company that fits this mold incredibly well is refuse   handler Waste Management. The company is the largest refuse   collection company, and it has a large network of landfills,   disposal centers, and recycling facilities across the U.S. The   waste-handling business inherently has lots of competitive   advantages for its well-established players. It's extremely   capital-intensive to build out a fleet of waste collection   vehicles, there are lots of regulatory hurdles involved in   opening new landfills and maintaining existing ones, and it's   extremely difficult to disrupt how humans generate and handle   waste. These things combine to give Waste Management a very   favorable operating environment where it can pass along rising   costs to customers pretty easily and generate a steady stream of   profits.For years, Waste Management has taken these competitive   advantages and turned them into a very shareholder-friendly   business. For more than a decade, the company has steadily raised   its dividend payments and bought back shares to generate high   rates of return in what many would consider a slow-growth   business.WM Return on Equity (TTM)data byYCharts.For beginning investors, companies with huge competitive   advantages like Waste Management are a great lesson in why it   pays to hang onto stocks for the long term. The company's share   price gains will never blow anyone's socks off, but its high   rates of return in an industry that will likely be around for   decades will reward those who hold onto their position.The transition is workingBrian Feroldi(Microsoft):I'm a firm believer that new dividend investors should seek out   big, highly profitable companies for their first investment. That   criteria perfectly describes Microsoft, which is why I think it's   a fantastic stock for beginners.Microsoft has been cranking out profits for decades thanks to   its stranglehold on the software industry. Products such as   Windows and Office are cash cows that have been a dependable   source of revenue for decades. That should hold true for a long   time to come.However, Microsoft's stock stagnated for years over worries   that the ever-changing tech world would render this company's   products obsolete. Thankfully, that worry got put to rest when   Satya Nadella took over the top chair in 2014. CEO Nadella   has placed an emphasis on moving Microsoft's products into the   cloud, a decision that's paying off handsomely as revenue from   products like Azure, Office 365, and Dynamics CRM Online are   surging. When you add in the growth of other product lines such   as Xbox, Bing, and Surface, Microsoft's bottom line has been   posting healthy gains in recent years.Looking ahead, market watchers believe Microsoft's bottom line   will grow by more than 9% annually over the next five years. That   seems realistic when combining the growth in cloud product sales   with its recently completed acquisition of LinkedIn. Add to that   the company's rock-solid dividend yield of 2.4%, and I can't help   but think Microsoft is a terrific stock for new dividend   investors to buy.Buy one of Buffett's favorites at a great valueJasonHall(American Express):Warren Buffett first bought shares of American Express when the   company's stock was selling for bargain prices. Decades later,   those shares are worth almost 10 times whatBerkshire Hathawaypaid -- but that's only the tip of the iceberg of what American   Express means for Buffett and Berkshire today.At the current $0.32 per share quarterly dividend, American   Express will pay Berkshire almost $195 million in dividends in   2017. That may seem like a paltry yield on its $12 billion stake,   but when we look at the yield on cost -- that is, how much   American Express' dividend pays based on the original investment   -- the math is much better: Berkshire gets paid a roughly 15%   yield on its cost for those AmEx shares. And with its prospects   and track record, that payout is likely to keep growing for years   to come.There's a wonderful lesson for beginning investors: Don't skip   the small-yielding stocks if you're looking for dividends.   Sometimes your best choice is one like American Express, which   has spent far more time yielding below 2% of its market price   than above 3%, but it has steadily and regularly raised its   dividend for decades:AXP Dividenddata byYCharts.Don't let today's paltry yield cause you to miss an excellent   dividend growth stock. American Express stock is cheap today,   trading near 14 times last year's earnings. And with its track   record of dividend growth, it could be paying you 15% or more on   your original investment in a couple of decades.The company at the core of our digital worldChuck Saletta(Cisco Systems):Cisco is the ubiquitous networking giant responsible for many of   the high-speed routers and switches that move financial   transactions, videos, pictures, and text all over the internet.   It's also establishing itself as a strong dividend player with   both a decent history of increasing its dividend and reasonable   room to continue raising it going forward. That combination sets   it up as a great potential investment for someone just now   dipping into the realm of dividend investing.Cisco paid its first dividend of $0.06 per share per quarter   in 2011, and it has been increasing it since then. The company's   current yield is almost 3.5%, which is a decent premium over   the general market. It recently raised its dividend from $0.26   per share per quarter to $0.29, an increase of 11.5%.

Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO) Is in a Rut, and Income Investors Love It;2/27/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsCisco Systems, Inc.(NASDAQ:CSCO) has justdelivered second-quarter FY17 earningsthat beat expectations on Wall Street, but once again proved that Cisco stock will not be returning to growth any time soon.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockCisco reported fourth-quarter revenue of $11.6 billion, $50 million above Wall Street consensus estimate, but -1.7% year-over-year. That marked the fifth straight quarter that the company has posted falling revenue.Sadly, things appears set to remain that way for at least the next few quarters. After all, Cisco guided to revenue growth of -2% to breakeven for the current quarter, and sees non-GAAP per-share earnings coming in at 57 cents 59 cents, in line with Wall Street's consensus of 58 cents.Oddly enough, Cisco stock has tucked on gains of 6% since the earnings call, reversing the selloff that happened immediately after the results. Cisco stock is now up a solid 13.3% year-to-date. So why, pray, are investors celebrating Cisco's revenue tailspin?Business Model Transition for Cisco StockCSCO is stuck in the throes of a serious business model transition. Since its early days, the company has been in the business of selling switches and routers that move data around the internet. That's still true in a big way since the company still derives more than 40% of its revenue from this networking business.But with more and more companies relying on rented computing services from the likes ofMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) andAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN), they are buying less and less of Cisco's hardware for their data centers.Even worse is the fact that when they do buy, they are upgrading to newer devices less often. Further, Cisco is increasingly facing tougher competition and cheaper offerings from the likes ofArista Networks Inc(NYSE:ANET), a company that was founded by former top Cisco executives.Throw in the fact that more companies are experimenting with software-defined networking (SDN), and Cisco is finding itself caught between a rock and hard place. Last quarter's results say it all: Cisco's switching and routing revenue for the quarter fell 5%  and 10% to $3.3 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively.But CSCO has, over the past few years, been working on a grand plan that involves pushing for a recurring subscription-based revenue model. This essentially means developing businesses that will protect it from the vagaries of the boom-and-bust cycles of its core business.Chief executive Chuck Robbins is optimistic that Cisco can leverage the lessons gleaned from its subscription-based businesses, such as Meraki cloud-controlled WiFi, Security software and Collaboration to build a solid subscription revenue businesses. Cisco's Security segment was the brightest spot in the earnings report after growing 14% to reach $528 million. Meanwhile the Collaboration business grew 4% to hit $1,062 million.Investors were pleased with Cisco's latest report is because it showed that the company is making progress discovering new recurring revenue streams. The company announced that product deferred revenue related to software and subscriptions grew 51% to reach $4 billion. Meanwhile, 10% of its $9 billion Product sales is now of a recurring nature, up from virtually zero a couple of years ago.Cash Cow and Dividend MachineFor all its troubles, Cisco remains by far the most dominant player in the networking business, something that has helped the company preserve its fat margins. During the last quarter, the company's Product gross margin decreased from 63.4% to 61.1%, but its Services gross margin increased from 65.1% to 67.7%. Improving margins is a good sign that the company's pricing power remains undiminished.Healthy margins have allowed CSCO stock to become a cash cow, with annual free cash flow approaching $13 billion. Cisco spends a lot of this cash on M&A activity. During the latest earnings call, Cisco announced that it was taking AppDynamics off the IPO table by doling out $3.7 billion for the application performance management startup. But income investors need not worry - in the same vein, Cisco announced that it was hiking its quarterly dividend by 3 cents to 29 cents.Cisco stock now yields a generous 3.5%, among the highest yields in theDow Jones Industrial Average.Bottom Line for Cisco StockCisco instituted the dividend six years ago when it declared a quarterly payout of 6 cents, good for a modest 1.4% yield. Since then, the company has hiked dividends at least once every year.Cisco is also sitting atop a cash hoard north of $60 billion, most of it stashed in overseas accounts. With the Trump administration looking to quickly enact legislation to lower corporate tax from 35% to 15% to 20%, Cisco will be in a position to repatriate at least some of that cash and continue rewarding investors.Mobile World Congress: Apple Inc. (AAPL) vs. Everyone ElseThe 10-year Treasury note has been rising, but at 2.52% remains well below the yield by Cisco stock. With such a healthy backdrop, Cisco stock remains a prime long-term holding especially for income investors.As of this writing, Brian Wu did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceThe 10 Best Stock Charts on Wall Street Right Now7 Food Stocks That Will Deliver Tasty ReturnsThe postCisco Systems, Inc.

To make its software seem more affordable, to break free of the boom bust cycle between major versions of Microsoft Office, and to address the growing threat of Google's free Google Apps suite, five years ago, the company began pushing Office 365.This subscription version of Microsoft Office brought recurring monthly revenue and other advantages. Microsoft expanded into Office apps for mobile devices likeApple Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AAPL) iPad and began to sell online storage for Office 365 users, with OneDrive.Google Apps/G SuiteGoogle wasn't sitting still, though, refining Google Apps intoG Suite, a full-on competitor to Office 365, with paid monthly subscription plans and online storage options. The company has also leveraged Google Apps and its lightweight Chrome OS into Chromebooks - ultra-low-cost laptops that have been giving Microsoft fits, especially in the education market.That education market is where the potential for disruption is really playing out. With its free Google Apps and low-cost Chromebooks, Google upended the education market. By the end of 2015,more than half of all device in U.S. classrooms were Chromebooks. This has repercussions beyond the classroom, as those students turn into young professionals who are more comfortable with Google's productivity software than with Microsoft Office.I've seen the effect first hand. My kids do everything at school using G Suite, despite Microsoft offering free Office 365 subscriptions to students and computer labs full of Windows PCs. They ignore Microsoft Office and Apple's Pages/Numbers on our home computers, and instead log onto G Suite for doing homework.If Google could quickly make waves in one of Microsoft's key strongholds, why couldn't Amazon.com march in and disrupt both companies?Why Amazon Would Take On Microsoft OfficeThis is a key question. Taking on the Google and Apple in the smart home with the Amazon Echo made sense because the smart speaker was a Trojan horse. It offers a growing number of ""Skills"" that let it control other smart devices by voice command, or interact with online services.That ropes consumers into buying it. But Alexa is a voice-activated path to effortlessly order products directly from Amazon.com, and gives an incentive to buy other Amazon products and services like Amazon Music Unlimited and Amazon Fire TV.Where's the win for AMZN in offering productivity software, other than to tweak Microsoft and Google?For the answer, look to AWS. Amazon Web Servicesdominates the market for cloud infrastructureand the profit from this division is a big driver of Amazon's overall growth. Amazon already has the servers in place and it has several of the components needed for a productivity suite, including its WorkDocs and WorkMail apps and the recently announcedAmazon Chimevideo conferencing software. Stitch these together with a few additional components and Amazon could have its Microsoft Office and Google G Suite competitor.Google charges $5 to $10 per month for G Suite, while Microsoft Office 365 has several tiered options starting at $5.99 per month.AMZN could charge a competitive rate for its new offering, adding more subscription-based revenue to its bottom line while taking advantage of its existing cloud muscle. The base monthly fee could be supplemented by charging for additional online storage for enterprise customers - something it has plenty of.Productivity software could also become another free perk of Prime membership. Prime members that start using Amazon's productivity software could put pressure on their employers to invest in a subscription, in an effect like Google's approach that sees students graduate and look to their employers to provide G Suite access.The Dow Jones Industrial Average Keeps Rising, But a Correction Is ComingAMZN isn't commenting andThe Information'ssources say all of this is still in the early stages, but the move makes sense. Amazon has been aggressively expanding beyond its role as an online retailer, AWS has the infrastructure needed to support the initiative, the company has been creeping into enterprise software with apps like WorkMail, and Google proved that the Microsoft Office behemoth isn't invulnerable. A productivity software suite from Amazon.com could well be the company's next big thing.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace3 High-Impact Tech Earnings: Tesla, Fitbit and Square3 Dow Titans Buckling Under the PressureThe postThe Next Big Thing for Amazon.com, Inc.

Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock Can Help You Compute Free Profits;2/27/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsI recently wrote on how todouble you moneywithMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT). While that trade is still performing, I can still enter with new prospects for the opportunity at hand. The idea is to profit from MSFT stock for free.makeArticleAd();Fundamentally, the long-term story remains intact. Microsoft is a well-managed company with several solid streams of profitable income. As long as markets in general hold up, it would take a lot of bad luck for it to be derailed.Click to EnlargeFor the short term, the price action in MSFT stock tells me that there is a move coming soon. Technically, the range has been tightening, and usually this resolves itself in a burst.The direction of the move is the unknown, but breaking past $65 per share could bring a new high, whereas losing current levels could cause a retest of $63 as support.Thanks to MSFT stock options, I can structure trades that would profit from the burst with little out of pocket risks.The Bet:Buy the Microsoft Apr $65/$62.50 debit put spread. This is a temporary bearish trade for which I pay 90 cents per contract to open. This is my maximum risk. My reward would be more than a double and would come if MSFT stock falls through my bought position.7 Blue-Chip Stocks That Are Flush With CashThe Other Side of My Thesis:This bet could be flipped by someone who has the opposite side of my short term thesis. Someone who thinks that the short term breakout will be upward can buy a debit call spread.Regardless of which way the bet lies, I can reduce my out-of-pocket expense. I will sell longer-term downside risk to finance the bet.The Bank:Sell the Microsoft Oct $57.50 put. This is a bullish trade for which I collect $2 per contract to open. I need MSFT stock to stay above my sold strike to win. The 10% price buffer from current price givens me a 90% theoretical chance of success. By selling a naked put, I am committing to owning the stock at that sold put if price falls below it. So I only do this if I am willing and able to execute the purchase. A less risky version of this would be to sell a credit put spread instead.As long as the MSFT stock price stays above my sold put strike, I can recapture premium from my bought, shorter-dated position by selling it back. Any premium I recapture from that debit spread would add to my profit.I am not required to hold Microsoft options trades open through expiration. I can close any trades at any time for partial gains or losses.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director ofSellSpreads.com.

Is a Surprise in Store for Autodesk (ADSK) in Q4 Earnings?;2/27/2017;"makeZacksArticleAd();Autodesk, Inc.ADSKis set to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Mar 2. In the last quarter, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 2.38%. The company has delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 26.79% in the trailing four quarters.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderAutodesk's business transition from licenses to cloud-based services is expected to benefit it in the long run by boosting its subscriptions and deferred revenues. In the last reported quarter, total subscriptions increased approximately 134,000 from the prior quarter while new model subscriptions (product, enterprise flexible license, and cloud subscription) increased 168,000 to 861,000.Autodesk is well positioned to capitalize on the rapid adoption of computer-aided designing and manufacturing through its comprehensive product portfolio. We expect its broad product portfolio to generate new customers in both domestic and overseas markets.Autodesk's aggressive acquisition strategy has played a pivotal part in developing its business. Plus, Autodesk also expanded its share repurchase program in its efforts to maximize shareholder value. Cost cutting initiatives are also a big positive.However, the company's financials may also be affected by increasing investments in cloud-based infrastructure and marketing initiatives. Foreign exchange fluctuations and competition in the cloud-computing domain from the likes of Amazon.com Inc.AMZN, Microsoft Corp.MSFTand Adobe Systems also remain headwinds.For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, Autodesk expects revenues in a range of $460 million - $480 million. Non-GAAP loss per share (excluding stock-based compensation expense and amortization of acquisition-related intangibles) is expected in a range of 32 cents- 39 cents for the quarter.Autodesk, Inc.

21 Video Game Stats That Will Blow You Away;2/25/2017;"For decades, video games have brought joy to countless   children around the world. And with more adults playing games in   recent years, the industry has become truly massive in its size   and scope.The statistics that follow will help to give you a sense of   the awesome scale of the global video-game market.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();The stats1. There are more than 2 billion video game players worldwide,   according to market intelligence companyNewzoo.2. Here in the United States, 63% of households have at least   one person who plays video games regularly (3 hours or more per   week), while 48% of U.S. households own a dedicated game console,   according to theEntertainment Software Association.3. And its not just kids who are playing these games; the   average game player age is 35 years old.4. In fact, while 27% of game players are under 18, 26% are 50   years old -- or older.5. As for gender, 59% of game players are male, while 41% are   female.6. In stark contrast to the image of an isolated gamer locked   away in a dark basement for hours on end, gaming appears to have   a significant social element to it; 53% of the most frequent game   players say video games help them connect with friends, and 42%   feel video games help them spend time with family.7. Moreover, the most frequent gamers who play multiplayer and   online games spend an average of 6.5 hours per week playing with   others online, and 4.6 hours per week playing with others in   person.8. In a sign that the industry has won increased parental   approval, 68% of parents say video games are a positive part of   their child's life, and 62% of parents whose children are gamers   play computer and video games with their children at least   weekly.9. There appear to be benefits to video game playing in   addition to just having fun. Of the most frequent gamers, 75%   believe playing video games provides mental stimulation or   education. This coincides with astudyby Yale University that showed that students who played a   brain-training video game for 20 minutes three times a week for   four months performed better on reading and math tests than their   peers who did not.10. These perceived benefits are likely contributing to the   growth of the U.S. video game industry, which saw video game   software sales rise 6% to $24.5 billion in 2016, according to theESA.11. On a global basis, the video game market reached $99.6   billion in revenue in 2016, up 8.5% compared to 2015, according   toNewzoo.12. China, which, like the U.S., accounts for nearly a quarter   of all global game revenues, is expected to approach $29 billion   in game revenue by 2019, up from $24.4 billion in 2016.13. Newzoo estimates that mobile gaming generated 37% of total   global video-game revenue in 2016, rising 21.3% year over year   and surpassing PC revenue for the first time ever.14. Still, PC and console-based gaming remain vital components   of the video-game market, with each segment comprising more than   $31 billion in sales in 2016, according toNewzoo.15. To date,Sony(NYSE: SNE) hasdominated the console wars, with sales of its PlayStation 4 recently surpassing 53 million   units worldwide. That's more than double the estimated 26 million   Xbox One unitsMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) has sold, and triple the 15 million Wii U units   sold byNintendo(NASDAQOTH: NTDOY) , according to research companySuperData.16. That's a valuable position for Sony -- and to a lesser   extent, Microsoft -- to hold, as consoles are increasingly   becoming an entertainment hub, with 50% of people who own game   consoles using them to watch movies, 28% using them to listen to   music, and 21% using consoles to consume live and other content,   according to the ESA.17. Notably, the growth in gaming appears to be coming at the   expense of other forms of entertainment. In particular, gamers   who are playing more video games than they did three years ago   are spending less time playing board games (49% of gamers),   watching TV (37%), and going to the movies (37%).18. Virtual reality appears to have a bright future within   gaming, as 58% of the most frequent gamers who are familiar with   virtual reality intend to play games on VR, and 40% say they will   likely purchase VR within the next year, according to the   ESA.19. An even more powerful growth driver for the gaming   industry is the emergence of eSports. The global audience for   eSports surged 36.6% to 323 million in 2016, and Newzooprojectsthat it will exceed 589 million worldwide by 2020.20. Global revenue in the eSports industry rose an even more   impressive 51.7%, to $493 million, in 2016 -- and isexpectedto approach $1.5 billion by 2020.21. All told, Newzooforecaststhat the global video game market will exceed $118 billion in   total revenue by 2019.Investor takeawayThe growing attraction of gaming among people of nearly all   ages and the surging popularity of eSports are propelling the   already $100 billion video-game industry to ever-rising   heights.While some are attempting to profit from this trend by buying   stock in console makers such as Sony or Microsoft, investors may   be best served by instead purchasing shares of the top video game   makers, such asActivisionBlizzard(NASDAQ: ATVI) andElectronic Arts(NASDAQ: EA) .Activision makes some of the most popular eSports games,   includingHeroes of the Storm,Call of Duty,StarCraft, andWarCraft,while Electronic Arts is owner of two of the most popular   sports-based eSports franchises inMaddenandFIFA.While console makers often struggle with razor-thin margins,   video-game makers are benefiting from the trend toward digital   distribution, which is boosting margins and overall profits for   bothElectronic ArtsandActivision.Perhaps most importantly, Activision and EA are video-game   pure plays, while Microsoft and Sony are much more diversified   businesses. As such, investments in Activision Blizzard and   Electronic Arts are a direct way to profit from the growth of the   global video-game market -- a bet I expect will pay off   handsomely in the years ahead.Offer from The Motley Fool: The 10 best stocks to buy       nowMotley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent     more than a decade beating the market.

Tech Most Popular Sector for Investment Fund Managers in 2017;2/24/2017;"Data show that Silicon Valley darlings once again captured the interest of stock fund managers looking to cash in on the sector's growth and dreams in the fourth quarter of 2016.In a ranking of the 20 S&P 500 stocks that U.S. funds managing more than $1 million bought the most, tech companies took eight spots: Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL), Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Cisco (CSCO), Alphabet (GOOG) and Intel (INTC). Microsoft and Apple also saw the most buying in the S&P 500, according to data compiled by GuruFocus.The results show U.S. investment fund managers packing into a market sector that already sprinted through last year, gaining 23.5% in 2016 versus 9.54% in the S&P 500. So far, it has not broken a sweat going into 2017, rising 29.49% year to date versus 5.58% in the S&P 500. Only one sector has outperformed it, financials, which rose 44.90% year to date on the back of investor optimism in future tax cuts and interest rate hikes.makeArticleAd();Some research indicates investors can expect further growth for tech. Global information company The NPD Group forecasts 2% growth in technology industry sales in 2017 from 2016, driven by innovation, new products and low prices. A gaggle of fresh product categories is also slated to lure more buyers, like drones, virtual reality and home automation products, in addition to seasoned products like TVs and PCs in the premium space.For just one product, drones, NPD researchers anticipate 177% in sales growth from 2016 to 2018, led mainly by hobbyists. Less tech-savvy consumers may also begin to get on board with smart home devices, where NPD predicts 80% growth over the same period.Other megatrends continue down the pipeline, like cloud computing, big dada and artificial intelligence, but some market watchers see reason for worry.""Looking at the other side of these favorable long-term trends, I remain wary of certain hardware companies whose products are becoming commoditized. For example, in the personal computer market, virtual reality headsets and computers are an opportunity for growth, but so far, demand has been largely anemic,"" said one analyst, Charlie Chai of Fidelity in a sector outlook.""""The smart-device market is increasingly saturated and lacks products capable of driving sustainable new excitement. On the enterprise hardware front, there continue to be many technology disruptions, which increase the long-term risks for some incumbents. Although valuations are generally low for enterprise hardware companies, I continue to struggle with their challenging long-term outlooks.""Employment momentum has carried over into 2017, indicating companies see these opportunities expanding. The tech industry added a net 9,000 jobs in the IT sector in January, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The highest employment growth occurred in software and technology services where 12,500 jobs were added, extending growth of 73,900 jobs in 2016, despite layoffs at numerous companies.Earnings growth has supported tech's rally. Of the 408 companies that had reported earnings as of Feb. 17, tech led all sectors with a 12.1% increase year over year, amounting to an additional $68.2 billion. Eight of the 11 sectors were expected to finish the quarter with improved earnings, according to Thomson Reuters. Yet when removing sub-industries with the highest growth, semiconductor equipment and electronic manufacturing services, the growth rate declines to 11.1%, more in line with financials and utilities.The S&P North American tech sector index had a trailing price-earnings ratio of 28.07 and projected price-earnings ratio of 20.47 as of Jan. 31. It also had a price-book ratio of 4.92%, price-free cash flow ratio of 16.52 and dividend yield of 1.21%. Its largest constituents are Apple, Microsoft, Facebook and Alphabet.Microsoft, favorite of most U.S. funds, grew fourth-quarter revenue 1.23%, operating earnings 2.5% and earnings 3.62% from the prior-year quarter, on the strength of cloud and office products and services. Personal computing fell 5% primarily by a drop in gaming revenue and its feature phone business, which it sold in November. During the quarter, the company returned $6.5 billion to shareholders in share repurchases and dividends.Donald Yacktman(Trades,Portfolio)'sYacktman Fund(Trades, Portfolio)s commented on the company in its recent letter, ""Microsoft's shares were solid contributors to fourth-quarter results as the company continues its remarkable transformation under CEO Satya Nadella. Microsoft could be a significant beneficiary of the new administration's proposed tax repatriation plan.""The biggest guru investor in Microsoft is Jeff Ubben (Trades, Portfolio), who has 19.71% of his reported portfolio in the company.Apple's performance also shined in most categories, with all-time sales record for its iPhone, services, Mac and Apple Watch. Fourth-quarter revenue rose 3.19%, and EPS increased 2.44% to an all-time high. Earnings for the company struggled, though, falling 2.62% year over year, as net and gross margins declined. Apple returned $15 billion to investors in share repurchases and dividends during the quarter. CEO Tim Cook also hinted at ""products in our pipeline.""A guru Apple shareholder, David Rolfe (Trades, Portfolio), commented in his Wedgewood Partners recent letter, ""Clearly the Company does not need to spend $10-$15 billion per year to sustain the evolutionary upgrades to the iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch and/or new video streaming services. Apple's nascent automotive program Project Titan may not be at all about creating a complete autonomous driving car (Apple Car), but rather the creation of software that makes existing cars smarter - or even autonomous. Now that is a huge, creatively disruptive opportunity.""Apple's top guru shareholder is David Einhorn (Trades, Portfolio), whose Greenlight Capital has 11.56% of its assets in his reported long portfolio in the stock. Another famous shareholder, Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio), owns 1.09% of Apple's shares, which make up 4.49% of Berkshire's portfolio. He added more than 42 million shares of the company in the fourth quarter.See more of fund manager's favorite S&P 500 stocks of the recent quarter here.Premium MembersThis article first appeared onGuruFocus."

How Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock Can Squeeze $26B From LinkedIn;2/24/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIt's been six weeks sinceMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) closed its $26.5 billion acquisition of LinkedIn, the largest deal ever made by the Seattle tech giant. Since the acquisition was announced in June 2016, there have been plenty of opinions surrounding the steep price paid for the business networking site - somepositive, somenegative- and those question marks will continue to follow Microsoft and MSFT stock until LinkedIn is able to pay its own way.makeArticleAd();Source:Mike Mozart Via FlickrI'm a fan of Microsoft stock - in late December,I predicted it would hit $80 in 2017- so I'm definitely rooting for LinkedIn to keep delivering the goods as it did in its Q3 2016 earnings, its last report as an independent company.Its$1.18 earnings per shareon a non-GAAP basis - 27 cents higher than what analysts were expecting - on $960 million in revenue was a major victory for LinkedIn which also saw memberships grow 18% to 467 million compared to the same quarter a year earlier. Most important, it actually made a small GAAP profit of $9.1 million in the quarter.MSFT is on a roll, but it will have to maintain momentum if it's going to have any chance of extracting future shareholder value of $26.5 billion or more over the next few years.Sure, the LinkedIn acquisition is about more than money, but ultimately that's one of the key criteria for evaluating a deal's success or failure.7 Blue-Chip Stocks That Are Flush With CashHere are the three things I believe will make the LinkedIn acquisition a success.Estimated Monthly UsersWhile LinkedIn is considered the top social media site for business networking, it has just 106 million monthly active users (MAU) out of 467 million members.Facebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) has almost 18 times that, with its1.86 billion MAU.Microsoft might have plans for LinkedIn that go beyond its user numbers but it's got to keep pushing the MAU metric higher because Facebook's not going to stop growing its user base, especially when it comes to helping people find and secure new jobs.LinkedIn isn't going to capture anyone but the high-income segment of the workforce; currently, 45% of those earning more than $75,000 use LinkedIn. That's got to be higher.Mobile Is KeyNielsen's2016 Social Media Reportreleased in January offered a really deep dive into the world of social media including mobile usage. Drawing data from 9,000 smartphone users 18 or older, Nielsen was able to determine the number of unique mobile users for the top 10 social media platforms; Facebook had 178.2 million unique users compared to 60.1 million for LinkedIn or just three times the number.If LinkedIn wants to capture a bigger social media audience, especially younger business professionals, it's going to have to get very smart about its mobile game plan which it appears to have done delivering a revamped mobile site in 2016.""We are seeing good results with the core experience, with our revamped mobile app driving significant engagement growth in 2016,"" Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said during the company's Q2 2017 conference call. ""This quarter, the sessions on LinkedIn grew more than 20% year over year, a consistent level of growth throughout 2016. We also achieved record levels of mobile page view.""LinkedIn TalentThe best thing Microsoft has done to date regarding its purchase of LinkedIn ispromoting Kevin Scottto chief technology officer for the entire company. That suggests that Microsoft didn't just buy a great networking site but also got a lot of talented people including Scott, who, in addition to his existing roles at LinkedIn will lead Microsoft's technology plans as well.As CTO, Scott will be empowered to continue to help grow Microsoft's cloud business by bringing it together with LinkedIn's network of professionals. Analysts see Microsoft's cloud businessgrowing by 33%annually over the next three years and accounting for 30% of Microsoft's overall revenue by the end of fiscal 2019.Apple Inc. vs. Alphabet Inc: Value or Growth?Often, when companies merge, the two businesses have vastly different corporate cultures creating turf wars between the different organizations. While early in the transition it appears that Nadella is very concerned about successfully integrating the LinkedIn team.Should this attitude remain, Microsoft's got a great chance at reaping the rewards necessary to recoup its investment.Bottom Line on MSFT StockObviously, it's way too early to assess the success or failure of the LinkedIn acquisition.However, looking back at the last five fiscal years, LinkedIn's best showing in terms of profitability was in 2012 when it had $56.9 million in operating profits on $972.3 million in revenue for an operating margin of 5.9%.If Microsoft can get LinkedIn to that operating margin within five years, it will be generating approximately $354 million in operating profits on $6 billion in revenue (15% CAGR), a good start on the way to repaying the $26.5 billion.These three points will certainly help.As of this writing, Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceThe 7 Best ETFs for Retirement InvestorsApple Inc.

Salesforce (CRM) to Report Q4 Earnings: What's in Store?;2/24/2017;"salesforce.com, Inc.CRMis set to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Feb 28. Last quarter, the company's earnings were in-line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderLast quarter, Salesforce witnessed significant year-over-year growth in both the top and the bottom line. The improvement was primarily attributed to the rapid adoption of the company's cloud-based solutions. Also, higher demand for Salesforce ExactTarget Marketing Cloud platform, part of the Salesforce1 Customer Platform, contributed to the improvement. We expect the trend to continue in the fourth quarter as well.A higher number of deal wins and geographical contributions should also boost results in the soon-to-be-reported quarter. Overall, the company's diverse cloud offerings and considerable spending on digital marketing remain growth catalysts. Moreover, strategic acquisitions and resultant synergies are expected to drive fourth-quarter results.Considering increased customer adoption and satisfactory performances, market research firm Gartner acknowledged Salesforce as the leading social CRM solution provider. We believe that the rapid adoption of the company's platforms indicates solid growth opportunities in the expanding cloud computing space, which will, in turn, boost results in the soon-to-be reported quarter.On the flip side, although the company is growing reasonably in the cloud market, growth prospects have been rationalized to a considerable extent due to intensifying competition from MicrosoftMSFTOracle Corp. and SAP AG. Moreover, currency fluctuations and stepped-up investments in international expansion and data centers could hurt the bottom line in the fiscal fourth-quarter bottom-line results.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Salesforce will beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positiveEarnings ESPand a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP:Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, currently stands at -25.00%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of 3 cents is a penny lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with ourEarnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank:Salesforce's Zacks Rank #2 when combined with a -25.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Salesforce.com Inc Price and EPS SurpriseSalesforce.com Inc Price and EPS Surprise|Salesforce.com Inc QuoteStocks to ConsiderHere are a couple of stocks that you may consider, as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Pure Storage Inc.PSTGhas an Earnings ESP of +4.17% and a Zacks Rank #2.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog includeAlphabet(NASDAQ:GOOGL-Free Report),Intel(NASDAQ:INTC-Free Report),NVIDIA(NASDAQ:NVDA-Free Report),Baidu(NASDAQ:BIDU-Free Report) andMicrosoft(NASDAQ:MSFT-Free Report).Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations.Get #1Stock of the Day pick for free.Here are highlights from Thursday's Analyst   Blog:Google Finds 'Waze' to Build Self-Driving TechnologyWhen asked some time back about the use cases for self-driving cars, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL-Free Report) executives said that they were exploring alternatives. Things have changed somewhat since then and we have slightly greater clarity on whether Google will maintain its own fleet, renting out for delivery of goods, food and/or passenger transport, or whether it will rent vehicles from their makers and sell those services itself.My bet was always on the latter, first because Google is primarily a technology company and thrives on making the kind of software that can take over our lives. Getting into the low-margin business of vehicle maintenance and renting just isn't its area of expertise.Furthermore, the kind of investment that is going into getting these animals on the road isn't justified unless there is a lucrative business out there with a relatively quick payback time.So the company's initial step toward commercialization by getting key people on board and announcing the name of the unit as Waymo was heartening. The goal of this unit is to develop self-driving technology for car makers.How Does All This Tie In with the Waze Carpool   Service?Waze was an Israeli crowd-sourced mapping service providing users with information such as traffic, road conditions and other helpful pointers, so they could quickly decide their route. At least that's what it was in 2013 when Google acquired it for $1.15 billion.Today, Waze is also a carpooling service that gets people travelling in the same direction to travel together and share the cost of gas. So yes, there are headaches to availing the service like having to book way in advance or not having anybody to pick one up on occasion. It also doesn't allow anyone to become a driver, so they can't make a living from it.All this goes to show that Google's plans in the area probably aren't crystallized and the service is a temporary measure to access that all-important thing these days called data. Data that can add to the treasure trove Google's already collecting through the test driving of its self-driving cars.The difficulties don't seem to have deterred users, however, because Google just announced the expansion of the service to unannounced locations in the U.S. and Latin America. And while not all Waze users are signing up for carpooling, it's significant that their numbers have reportedly swelled from 45 million in 2013 to 75 million today. So even if a small percentage of this growing number of people goes for it, it can still be a compelling number.Taxi Service Is What Uber, Lyft Do WellThere's no doubt about it, these two companies have been growing in leaps and bounds as the convenience and quality of service have attracted more and more people. So the prospect of other, perhaps cheaper (because a self-driving car doesn't need a driver) services coming online certainly isn't good news.Google was an initial investor in Uber, but when the company started developing self-driving technology to save its neck, Google representative David Drummond removed himself from its board. Uber still uses Google mapping services, but has increased investments to develop maps of its own.ConclusionUber and its pals have popularized the concept of ride-hailing/car-sharing services but now that the concept has caught on, there will be new entrants. This is a big opportunity for car makers because this is the space where new cars will be deployed in the future.On the technology side, there is the need for machine learning and cloud support, mapping technology, and sensors, which have to be installed on cars built to house the technology. And that's exactly why companies like Intel (NASDAQ:INTC-Free Report) are tying up with companies like Mobileye, while NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA-Free Report) pairs up with Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU-Free Report) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT-Free Report). Then of course there's Google. These companies are in turn testing the technology through collaboration agreements with automakers.But who will get there first? Industry watchers don't expect anything viable until 2020. Even if it's a couple of years out from there, it does look like there will be more than one approach/technology driving the experience. And since the possibilities are tremendous, there won't necessarily be a single winner.Google, Microsoft, Intel and NVIDIA all have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now. But you can findthe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy)   stocks here.Zacks' Top 10 Stocks for 2017In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2017?Who wouldn't?

Digital   security does not even stop at the company level as we saw in the   recent United Stateselection.Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) President and Chief Legal Officer Brad Smith   believes that the tech industry has both the ability and   responsibility to work together on protecting the world from   digital attacks/cybercrime. In a piece posted on aMicrosoft blogin advance of the annual RSA Conference, which brings together   security professionals from around the world, he laid out his   case for what he called a Digital Geneva Convention -- a   commitment by the technology industry to collectively work across   borders to keep the world safe from digital crime.""Just as the Fourth Geneva Convention recognized that the   protection of civilians required the active involvement of the   Red Cross, protection against nation-state cyberattacks requires   the active assistance of technology companies,"" he wrote. ""The   tech sector plays a unique role as the internet's first   responders, and we therefore should commit ourselves to   collective action that will make the internet a safer place,   affirming a role as a neutral Digital Switzerland that assists   customers everywhere and retains the world's trust.""makeArticleAd();It's a bold idea that would sometimes force companies to work   against self-interest. For example, one pillar of Smith's   proposed Digital Geneva Convention calls for companies to ""report   vulnerabilities to vendors rather than stockpile, sell, or   exploit them."" That may not be easy to get industrywide   cooperation on, but Smith lays out a case that the need is very   strong.Cyber security has become a global problem. Image source:     Getty Images.How big is the problem?Nearly three quarters (74%) of the world's businesses expected   a cyberattack in 2016 with the economic impact of cybercrime   expected to reach $3 trillion by 2020, Smith wrote. What's worse,   the Microsoft executive said, is that crimes are not just being   carried out by rogue elements or even unscrupulous businesses,   they are now increasingly being carried out by nations.""TheSony(NYSE: SNE) attack by North Korea in 2014 was not the first   nation-state attack, but it represented a visible turning point,""   he wrote. ""While prior attacks had focused on economic and   military espionage, the Sony attack in 2014 involved retaliation   for free expression in the form of a (not very popular)   movie.""That breach and subsequent release of data was followed in   2015 by ""even more visible international discussion about   nation-state attacks aimed at the theft of companies'   intellectual property,"" wrote Smith. In 2016, he added, the issue   ""broadened again to include hacking incidents connected to the   democratic process itself.""What does Microsoft want done?Smith called on the world's governments to come together. He   wants them to agree on ""international cybersecurity norms that   have emerged in recent years, adopt new and binding rules and get   to work implementing them."" That's a bold ask given how hard it   is to get consensus on anything on a global or at least   near-global level. The Microsoft executive breaks it down into   six major points:No targeting of tech companies, private sector, or critical     infrastructureAssist private sector efforts to detect, contain, respond     to, and recover from eventsReport vulnerabilities to vendors rather than stockpile,     sell, or exploit themExercise restraint in developing cyber weapons and ensure     that any developed are limited, precise, and not reusableCommit to nonproliferation activities to cyber weaponsLimit offensive operation to avoid a mass eventYou can see that this list is really just a bare bones   guideline. Restraint, for example, can mean different things to   different people. Still, what Smith and Microsoft are proposing   would be a bold effort to engage the private sector in responding   to nation-state cyber attacks while also creating a framework for   how governments agree to use their own offensive digital attack   abilities.Why is this important to Microsoft?Governments cannot battle cybercrime effectively without help   from the private sector. Rogue nations however can do great   damage with cyber attacks.The Sony situation with North Korea involved a country using   digitally stolen material to lash back at a business over the   content of a movie. It was an event that showed that every   company is vulnerable whether it be through the release of   private communications, the theft of intellectual property, or   even the corruption of software or hardware to do things it's not   supposed to do (like spy on people, record data including credit   card numbers, or pretty much any other dastardly thing you can   think of).Because cyberspace is intangible, it's not as easily   governable as the real world. Different rules need to be created   and that requires a much broader consensus between nations. Going   forward however Microsoft is right that a new level of   cooperation is required between both rival companies and the   governments of the world.Cybercrime, hacks, and digital attacks can potentially not   only cripple businesses, but in theory change the fate of   nations. How the technology community and nations work in   fighting that together has to be worked out and ground rules   created before the next disaster strikes.10 stocks we like better than MicrosoftWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

He describes himself as ""strongly bullish"" on the name but adds that he only feels ""the urge to write about"" it when he thinks it is overvalued.He says he did call a pullback in Facebook stock in the past when it fell $10 to $123 per share over the four days following his call. Then it fell to $115 over the next two weeks.Of course the stock rallied, as he says it ""always"" will, but he notes that anyone who held through that pullback ""missed a significant buyback opportunity that would have more than accommodated a transition from capital gains tax on long-term holdings to income tax on short-term holdings for most sizable positions.""Verial noted that Facebook Inc (FB) stock has been in overbought territory since the end of January, which means it probably won't take much to set off a downward spiral. He pointed to seasonal patterns in data on the stock showing where it almost always goes in each month.According to him, Facebook stock almost always ends January in the green, and its highest Sharpe ratio also is in January. Average gains during the month stand at 10%.But in February, he said the stock's Sharpe ratio has fallen to zero, making the month neutral. Then in March, the Sharpe ratio turns negative, ""hinting at a significant opportunity cost."" He adds that even long-term holders may find it beneficial to avoid the stock during the worst months, which includes March, May and August. These months aren't usuallyearningsmonths anyway, and they're well after the holiday season at a time when spending on digital advertising starts to fall.He does feel that long is the only ""logical"" position to take on Facebook when looking at it from a long-term fundamental perspective.The postFacebook Stock Pulls Back After Touching Another Record Highappeared first onValueWalk.Many academics claim investing is a ""random walk.""

Apple Inc. Fesses Up to iPhone 6 Battery Issue, Releases Fix;2/24/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIf it seems as thoughApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) has been fighting with battery issues with the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s for months, that's because it has.makeArticleAd();Source: AppleThere was a limited recall of iPhone 6s batteries blamed on a manufacturing issue, problems in China and recently reports of widespread iPhone 6 sudden shutdown issues that seemed battery related. The company always denied any widespread issue.Until now.AAPL has finally acknowledged a problem related to the iPhone 6 battery … and says it has released a fix.The iPhone 6 Battery Has Been … ProblematicIf there's one thing 2016 will be remembered for when it comes to consumer electronics, it's the challenges of working with lithium-ion batteries.5 Income Tax Deductions You Can't Afford to MissThe poster child for just how wrong this technology can go isSamsung Electronic Co Ltd(OTCMKTS:SSNLF). Samsung had a terrible 2016 after its flagship Galaxy Note 7's lithium-ion batteries were implicated in multiple fires, This led to a complete recall of the device, an estimated $10 billion hit, a seriously damaged reputation and anextensive investigation to pinpoint the cause.In comparison, AAPL's iPhone 6 battery woes have been less spectacular, but the cloud over Apple's previous two generations of phones has lasted just as long - if not longer. And they proved much more frustrating in terms of nailing down a cause, or a fix. That's because there appear to be multiple issues at play. And just as Apple admits there's a problem and announces a solution, another iPhone 6 battery issue seems to pop up.In 2016, Apple had to deal with aninvestigation in Chinaover reports that iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s batteries were not only failing, but leaving the devices with expensive damage. Apple's findings pointed to cheap knock-off chargers as the culprit. Then there were reports of iPhone 6s phones unexpectedly shutting down. Apple eventually pinpointed the cause as being a manufacturing defect in a batch of batteries. Abattery exchange programwas launched, but that got off to a rocky start when Apple Stores were flooded by iPhone owners hoping for a replacement battery, and a backlog of repairs.Just as that mess was being sorted out, complaints began to rise of iPhone 6 sudden shutdown issues. This was a new iPhone 6 battery issue and seemed to affect a growing number of users. It also affected the iPhone 6s, but not the iPhone 7.The problem got so bad that at one point in January, rumors started thatApple was planning to launch a full-scale iPhone 6 battery exchange program. However, AAPL continued to deny there was a widespread problem with iPhone and 6s batteries.Now, Apple has come clean.Apple Releases Fix for iPhone 6 Shutdown IssueThe company finally admitted that iPhone 6 and 6s phones have been suddenly and randomly shutting down, forcing owners to plug them into a charger before they can be restarted. But, AAPL says it released a fix and it's effective.In a statement released toTechCrunch, Apple says iOS 10.2.1 finally addresses the issue:""We're seeing a more than 80% reduction in iPhone 6s and over 70% reduction on iPhone 6 of devices unexpectedly shutting down.""So what happened?AAPL says the iPhone 6 battery (and in some cases the iPhone 6s as well) suffers from a limitation of all-lithium-ion batteries. As these batteries get older, they sometime deliver power unevenly. This could trigger the iPhone's power management system to force an emergency shutdown to protect the device.Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Just Entered Dangerous TerritoryApple made changes to that system in iOS 10.2.1, essentially making it less sensitive to minor fluctuations. It also added new functionality so that should an iPhone 6 sudden shutdown occur, the user can restart their device without having to be connected to a charger. The company says it also will add a battery diagnostic screen to iOS that warns iPhone owners when their battery requires service.The fact this issue was directly related to aging lithium-ion batteries explains why it was the iPhone 6 battery being implicated more frequently than the 6s, why the numbers seemed to keep growing and why the iPhone 7 hasn't yet been affected.Will this mark the end of AAPL's drawn out iPhone 6 battery saga? The company has been playing whack-a-mole trying to identify issues with its lithium-ion batteries. But this fix seems to be enough of an umbrella solution that it may finally be able to put this chapter behind it.And let Apple go back to the good old days when complaints were limited to wishing the iPhone lasted longer on a battery charge …As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceWWDC 2017: Here's What Apple Inc.

Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) First Quarter Earnings Beat Not Enough;2/24/2017;"Shares of Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) plunged as much as 7% Thursday, falling to low of $23 in the after-hour session after the tech giant reported mixed first quarter fiscal 2017 result after Thursday's closing bell that showed despite the improvements HPE has made to grow in the realm of the cloud, competition from the likes of Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) aren’t going away.The Palo Alto, Calif.-based tech giant stunned the market with more than 80% stock gains over the past year, driven by its hybrid cloud initiatives. While the company’s transformation as a standalone entity since its separation from its printing arm, Hewlett Inc. (HPQ), has enabled HPE to show better financial performance, HPE on Thursday needed to account for the level of confidence investors have shown. In that regard, the miss on revenue and tepid guidance wasn’t enough.In the three months that ended January, Hewlett Packard Enterprise reported a net income of $267 million, or 16 cents per share. On an adjusted basis, when taking out one-time gains and costs, earnings, were 45 cents per share, which beat Thomson Reuters forecast by a penny and above last year’s total of 41 cents per share.makeArticleAd();First quarter revenue of $11.41 billion, meanwhile, not only fell short of Street forecasts of $12.13 billion, it marked a year-over-year decline of 10.4%. Notably, this is the company’s third consecutive quarter during which it has missed on the top line. The company's focus on hardware for data centers instead of faster-growing software has posed a challenge. The market for the latter, particularly cloud services is forecast to increase more than 20% annually.“I believe HPE remains on the right track,” said Meg Whitman, President and CEO of Hewlett Packard Enterprise in a statement. “The steps we’re taking to strengthen our portfolio, streamline our organization, and build the right leadership team, are setting us up to win long into the future.”Despite Whitman’s confidence, the company, which has placed long-term bets with investments in emerging markets, reduced its fiscal 2017 earnings per share forecast to $1.88 to $1.98, compared to analysts estimates of $2.03. Among other reasons for lowering forecast, Whitman cited currency fluctuations, higher commodities prices on items such as memory chips for servers and “near-term execution issues.”These issues aside, the stock’s punishment Thursday seems like an overreaction — though not surprising, given the strong gains over the past year. While I wouldn’t recommend jumping in to buy HPE stock at the moment, these shares — currently around $23 — should be bought if they fall to $22."

AAPL has $247 billion of cash on hand, although most of it is stuck overseas.However, we are in a new era, and it is an era where President Trump and Congress may lower the corporate tax rate to 15%. If that happens, the $230 billion of cash it holds overseas will be repatriated. That will leave Apple with $212 billion of cash.This insane amount of money will be partially used to bump the dividend, probably by as much as $4 per share over time, pushing AAPL stock into income stock territory.Blue-Chip Stocks: General Electric (GE)Source: ShutterstockCash Balance:$92 billionWhat It Should Do:M&A, Share buybacksGeneral Electric Company(NYSE:GE) is not the company it once was, and I recently wrote that I don't think you want to be buying GE stock at $30 per share.

Google Finds 'Waze' to Build Self-Driving Technology;2/23/2017;"When asked some time back about the use cases for self-driving cars, AlphabetGOOGLexecutives said that they were exploring alternatives. Things have changed somewhat since then and we have slightly greater clarity on whether Google will maintain its own fleet, renting out for delivery of goods, food and/or passenger transport, or whether it will rent vehicles from their makers and sell those services itself.My bet was always on the latter, first because Google is primarily a technology company and thrives on making the kind of software that can take over our lives. Getting into the low-margin business of vehicle maintenance and renting just isn't its area of expertise.Furthermore, the kind of investment that is going into getting these animals on the road isn't justified unless there is a lucrative business out there with a relatively quick payback time.So the company's initial step toward commercialization by getting key people on board and announcing the name of the unit as Waymo was heartening. The goal of this unit is to develop self-driving technology for car makers.How Does All This Tie In with the Waze Carpool Service?Waze was an Israeli crowd-sourced mapping service providing users with information such as traffic, road conditions and other helpful pointers, so they could quickly decide their route. At least that's what it was in 2013 when Google acquired it for $1.15 billion.Today, Waze is also a carpooling service that gets people travelling in the same direction to travel together and share the cost of gas. So yes, there are headaches to availing the service like having to book way in advance or not having anybody to pick one up on occasion. It also doesn't allow anyone to become a driver, so they can't make a living from it.All this goes to show that Google's plans in the area probably aren't crystallized and the service is a temporary measure to access that all-important thing these days called data. Data that can add to the treasure trove Google's already collecting through the test driving of its self-driving cars.The difficulties don't seem to have deterred users, however, because Google just announced the expansion of the service to unannounced locations in the U.S. and Latin America. And while not all Waze users are signing up for carpooling, it's significant that their numbers have reportedly swelled from 45 million in 2013 to 75 million today. So even if a small percentage of this growing number of people goes for it, it can still be a compelling number.Taxi Service Is What Uber, Lyft Do WellThere's no doubt about it, these two companies have been growing in leaps and bounds as the convenience and quality of service have attracted more and more people. So the prospect of other, perhaps cheaper (because a self-driving car doesn't need a driver) services coming online certainly isn't good news.Google was an initial investor in Uber, but when the company started developing self-driving technology to save its neck, Google representative David Drummond removed himself from its board. Uber still uses Google mapping services, but has increased investments to develop maps of its own.ConclusionUber and its pals have popularized the concept of ride-hailing/car-sharing services but now that the concept has caught on, there will be new entrants. This is a big opportunity for car makers because this is the space where new cars will be deployed in the future.On the technology side, there is the need for machine learning and cloud support, mapping technology, and sensors, which have to be installed on cars built to house the technology. And that's exactly why companies like IntelINTCare tying up with companies like Mobileye, while NVIDIANVDApairs up with BaiduBIDUand MicrosoftMSFT. Then of course there's Google. These companies are in turn testing the technology through collaboration agreements with automakers.But who will get there first? Industry watchers don't expect anything viable until 2020. Even if it's a couple of years out from there, it does look like there will be more than one approach/technology driving the experience. And since the possibilities are tremendous, there won't necessarily be a single winner.Google, Microsoft, Intel and NVIDIA all have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now.

Why Nokia Corp (NOK) Stock Should Make a BIG Comeback Soon;2/23/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsNokia Corp (ADR)(NYSE:NOK) announced its fourth-quarter results on Feb. 2 and it exceeded analysts' expectations. NOK's operating profits dropped by 27% from the prior-year quarter to 940 million euros, or $1 billion. Analysts polled byReuterswere expecting profits of 788 million euros for Nokia stock.makeArticleAd();Source:Open Grid Scheduler / Grid Engine via Flickr (Modified)Given the better-than-expected results, analysts at Morgan Stanley, led by Francois Meunier upgraded Nokia stock to ""overweight"" from ""equal weight,"" with a new price target of €5.70. Meunier particularly likes how NOK stock is improving its margins.In addition to improving margins, I believe Nokia's return to the smartphone market should also bring optimism.NOK-Branded Smartphone Coming Back to the MarketThe story of Nokia's last ten years or so has been all about how the smartphone revolution swept the company into oblivion. It eventually sold its phone business toMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT), which eventually sold it to Foxconn and HMD Global in 2016.Following the transfer of phone assets, HMD Global launched the Nokia 6 smartphone in China in January of this year. According to reports, the smartphone is being bought so quickly that it created an impression that HMD Global was only doing flash sales. HMD Global hadto clarifythat quick sellouts were the reason it appeared as though it has been a flash sale.7 Ultra-Cheap Value Stocks to Buy NowHMD is expected to announce a few more Android-run Nokia phones at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona later this month. According to reports, HMD will be announcing the Nokia P1 and two Nokia D1C smartphones at the event. We expect the Nokia P1 to be a high-end smartphone, with Nokia stockhinting at usingitsWeibo Corp (ADR)(NASDAQ:WB) account that an Android-powered Nokia phone with the Snapdragon 835 SoC is in the works.Other reports claim that the P1 phone will sport a 22.6 megapixel camera and IP68 water and dust resistance. Its pricing would range between $779 and $900, depending on the storage size.On the other hand, one of the Nokia D1C smartphoneswill be a mid-range smartphone, sporting the Snapdragon 430 SoC, 3GB RAM and a 16-megapixel rear-facing camera, according to reports. It's expected to cost around $200. The other D1C smartphone is expected to be of lower spec with 2GB RAM and a 13-megapixel rear-facing camera.I decided to give a rundown of what's expected to point out that Nokia stock and its licensees are targeting every segment of the smartphone market with their pipeline. The P1 will compete at the high-end of the market; one of the D1C's will compete at the mid-level market, while the other D1C will compete for low-end customers.I believe that this multi-pronged approach increases the chances that NOK stock will be somewhat relevant in the smartphone market - at least one of the consumer segments should find its phones attractive.I'm particularly optimistic about the low-end D1C smartphone. Variousreviews about affordable branded smartphoneshave carrier-locked iPhone 5s as the most affordable smartphone around. And that price is mostly limited to the U.S. Unlocked versions cost more. So in essence, by the time the low-end Nokia D1C gets to the market, it would be just about the most affordable branded smartphone there is.Bottom Line on Nokia StockWith such an offer, I see an opportunity for NOK stock to capture the ""unbranded"" smartphone market. Higher affordability is a common feature of unbranded smartphones phones. With the low-end D1C, Nokia will be offering customers who have been deterred by high price an opportunity to own branded phones at an affordable price.2 Reasons Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA) Stock Is Even More EnticingThe seemingly high demand for Nokia 6, which launched for 1699 Chinese Yuan (roughly $247) in China, is proof that lower-end NOK stock phones stand a chance.But, it should be noted that the company would only receive royalty payments on every sale of Nokia branded products. In other words, only a portion of the money these phones generate will end up in NOK's books.Still, this is high-margin revenue since the licensees bear the production costs and it will go some way to help Nokia stock fix its worsening revenue problem over the long-term.Overall, while I believe that NOK stock is on the right way to recovery. However, Nokia stock isn't for the faint-hearted. Although the reward could be great for long-term investors with a high risk-taking quotient.As of this writing, Craig Adeyanju did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace7 Consumer Stocks That Will Knock Your Socks Off7 Stocks to Sell or Short Before the Bears StrikeThe postWhy Nokia Corp (NOK) Stock Should Make a BIG Comeback Soonappeared first onInvestorPlace."

PowerShares QQQ Trust (QQQ): Short the Titans of Tech;2/23/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe rally inPowerShares QQQ Trust, Series 1 (ETF)(NASDAQ:QQQ) has reached epic proportions as the tech rally moves relentlessly higher on a daily basis. Like all good things, however, it will eventually come to an end. And the end is nigh for the Nasdaq. I expect QQQ to have a meaningful pullback over the coming few weeks.makeArticleAd();QQQ is comprised of the top 100 Nasdaq stocks, with the largest five holdings comprising nearly 40% of the index. These are the heavyweights of tech, with names likeApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL),Microsoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT),Amazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN),Facebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) andAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL).While the valuations given to AMZN and FB have always been rich (or perhaps absurd), now even Apple, the biggest component of the QQQ, is no longer the value stock is was a year ago. AAPL currently sports a price-to-earnings multiple over 16, by far the highest over the past year.Click to EnlargeYear-to-date, the QQQ is up a stunning 10%. To put that in a different context, if the Q's maintained the torrid pace of the rally, it would end up the year with a gain of 97.8%. Of the 34 trading days this year, QQQ has been up 27 days and down only seven.In February, there have been 12 up days and only two down days, with the two down days only being 11 cents and 4 cents.Certainly might be difficult to sustain that type of pace going forward.7 Ultra-Cheap Value Stocks to Buy NowThe Q's are by far the most overbought in the past two years with a 14-day RSI reading over 85. Readings at these extremes are rare indeed, especially for an index or ETF.Click to EnlargeImplied volatility (IV) is priced at the lowest levels over that time frame, meaning option prices are cheap, trading at only 4%. Yesterday saw notable put trading in the QQQ, with an inordinate amount of put selling. This type of action is usually indicative of tops in the underlying shares.So with the Q's at grossly overbought levels and with option prices dirt cheap, taking a bearish position using long put options makes a lot of sense.QQQ Trade IdeaBuy QQQ March $130 puts at $1.50 or better.These are the at-the-money puts and cost only 1.1% the price of the QQQ. With IV at low levels, gamma is high, meaning these options are poised to move. A mere 2% pullback over the coming few weeks would result in a doubler for these options.Those wishing to defray some of the exposure could elect to sell shorter-term weekly options against the long traditional Mar $130 puts.As of this writing, Tim Biggam did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Why Twilio Inc (TWLO) Stock Is Still Too Expensive;2/22/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsApplication software supplierTwilio Inc(NYSE:TWLO) did not make much of a jump on the stock markets after reporting its fourth-quarter earnings. In fact, Twilio stock is still far from the $70.96 high it reached last year in September 2016. Bearishness is extremely high, as its short float stood at 66.3%. And despite all of this, the company reported soaring revenue and smaller losses and projected Q1 figures higher than consensus. However, these are not good enough reasons to pay over 10 times sales for TWLO stock.makeArticleAd();Source:Web Summit Via FlickrLast quarter, Twilio reported 60% year-over-year growth, or $82 million in revenue. The company broke even, compared to expectations for a $0.05 per share loss. The company now forecast revenue of $82 million to $84 million, above a consensus of around $78 million.For the full year, Twilio still expects a loss of between $0.15 to $0.19 per share. The loss estimates are higher than the consensus for a drop of $0.10 per share.TWLO: Business MoatTwilio's moat is showing up in the financial results. Base revenue grew 73% YoY. Its platform business model added 2,000 new active customers in the quarter. Companies like Blue Cross Blue Shield,Capital One Financial Corp.(NYSE:COF) and one of the largest airlines are only some of the customers TWLO added. Businesses need call center technology that supports the growing telephone volumes. These companies count on Twilio for its monitoring capabilities and platform scalability.Functionally, Twilio's edge over competitors is providing the transformation from legacy hardware and physical networks to software. Although TWLO is losing money now, its profit margin is higher in software. Revenue will eventually exceed costs.The 10 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold ForeverTwilio's solutions add efficiency for its customers and improve the customer experience. First, the company added more offerings, including dual-channel recording. Second, it added private Ethernet and MPOS connections for customers to the cloud for VoIP (voice-over-IP). Third, APIs allow customers to add users to the solution in an easy and automated way. TWLO's solution supportsMicrosoft Corporation's(NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure Bot Service andAmazon.com, Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AMZN) Lex framework.Partners such as Zendesk andSalesforce.com, Inc.(NYSE:CRM) both support Twilio's APIs.Despite the growing customer base and higher revenue, Non-GAAP operating expenses were 59%, or $48.2 million, of total revenue. Although expenses are up from $34 million last year, the company barely managed break-even (non-GAAP) earnings. For fiscal-year 2017, TWLO still expects a non-GAAP loss of $17 million to $13 million, due to hiring and upfront costs. It expects to break-even in the fourth quarter of 2017.Boeing Co: 2 Tailwinds That Could Propel BA StockOn theconference call, Twilio pointed to artificial intelligence as one of the catalysts for top-line growth: ""within our partner ecosystem, we are starting to offer AI powered solutions to our customers in the form of the marketplace that we launched last year where we do a revenue share with those partners between our customers.""To win customers, TWLO relies on what the developer brings to the enterprise. The company does not spend too much from the sales and marketing. Still, it will beef up that unit to win customers and grow revenue.Bottom Line on TWLO StockBy catering to developers through APIs, Twilio is making it easy for customers to build a use case and scale a proof of concept. That accelerates adoption of Twilio's solution, allowing the company to add thousands of customers by 155% last year. Yet the stock is not cheap: Short-sellers are betting the valuations will fall if growth slows sooner than thought. Chances are low that TWLO will face a slowdown this year. Beyond that, investors risk downside if it reports just one bad quarter.As of this writing, Chris Lau did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceThe 10 Best Oil Stocks to Buy Now for Big-Time Gains7 S&P 500 Stocks Poised For Explosive GrowthThe postWhy Twilio Inc (TWLO) Stock Is Still Too Expensiveappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Tech Stock Roundup: FB TV App, AAPL Original Content;2/22/2017;"Technology stocks had a relatively quiet week although there were increased signs that companies like FacebookFBand AppleAAPLwere getting more serious about not just content acquisition but also content creation. While this may not be in direct competition with NetflixNFLXit does look like competition for Alphabet'sGOOGLYouTube, Spotify and PandoraP. It's also definitely competition for eyeballs in what is limited free time for all-Facebook TV AppFacebook has launched a new TV app for Amazon Fire TV, Apple TV and Samsung Smart TV, with possible plans to further expand to other platforms like Microsoft Xbox, Sony PlayStation and other streaming devices. While this will likely enable/support longer video formats, Facebook has said its intention is not to compete with Netflix but rather to enable Facebook users to watch their preferred video on just about any screen of their choice (and that includes TV screens).Of course that's not the only video announcement Facebook made. The company says that henceforth, videos will play automatically with the sound turned on by default (if the device sound is turned on) and the window will retreat to the bottom corner of the screen so you can keep watching the video while scrolling through your newsfeed. Facebook says that testing is showing a positive reaction from users, although it's obvious that not everyone will be overjoyed.Facebook is also reportedly in talks with music labels to bring their content to the app, which seems like an open challenge to YouTube, Google's competing site. For labels, the new distribution channel will increase their leverage against YouTube for more favorable terms. On the flip side, the chances of piracy will increase given the nature of Facebook's free platform.The increased scope for advertising is also an indication that the company is gearing up to grab its share of TV ad dollars.Apple Getting Ready to Debut Reality ShowEddie Cue, Apple's SVP of Internet software and services used the Recode Media Conference to express a lot of enthusiasm for Apple's soon-to-be released ""Planet of the Apps"" reality show on its music subscription service. Contestants will get 60 seconds to explain their idea on an escalator and could win up to millions in venture capital funding if judges will.i.am, Jessica Alba, Gary Vaynerchuk and Gwyneth Paltrow approve. This is the first attempt by Apple to create original content and will likely be joined by Carpool Karaoke in April (Apple bought out the unscripted version of this show in the summer of last year).Google Fiber RestructuringAlphabet has been trimming staff at its Access unit, which is responsible for its high-speed Internet service called Fiber. But last week, the trimming was more in the nature of hacking as it transferred hundreds of employees to other units, retaining just enough to work in the field. The unit also has a new CEO in Greg McCray, who was formerly CEO of Aero Communications and currently also serves on the board of telecom company CenturyLink.The changes while significant are not really surprising, because Google has had a lot of trouble with Fiber not only because of the expense but also because of tussles with telecom companies over their control on telecom poles. In fact, ever since its acquisition of WebPass last year, speculation has been rife that the company will replace or reduce fiber deployment with a cheaper wireless service. That plan seems to have crystallized now as Google cuts staff but remains committed to expanding its Fiber service.CompanyLast WeekLast  6 MonthsAAPL+2.36%+22.12%FB+2.45%+7.12%GOOGL+1.79%+3.68%MSFT+0.50%+10.23%INTC-3.23%+0.86%CSCO+0.61%+1.61%AMZN+2.12%+7.94%Other stories you might have missed-CorporateAussie Banks Respond to Apple Statement: In response to Apple's contention that the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, National Australia Bank Ltd., Westpac Banking Corp. and Bendigo & Adelaide Bank Ltd were looking for a free ride, they have told the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission (ACCC) that on the contrary, Apple's policies attempted to prevent competition in wallets. Because if Apple allowed them access to its NFC antenna, they would pledge their participation in the Apple Pay rollout.Australian law allows such collective bargaining, provided it is approved by the government. In its draft ruling, the ACCC denied the banks' request. The final ruling is expected in March and in the meantime, the Australian Retailers Association have backed the banks, making their own submission that the collective negotiations would be beneficial for ""all banks, merchants, app developers and ultimately customers in Australia and overseas.""Facebook Seeks Independent Media Audit: Facebook has agreed to be audited by Media Rating Council, an industry body that advertisers trust for ad measurement metrics. Ad prices on the social network have been rising despite the fact that Facebook has repeatedly come out with statements seeking to rectify viewership numbers.The company has therefore been under slight pressure to mend relationships with advertisers. The agreement should increase transparency and instill confidence in advertisers, which are directly responsible for its bread and butter.Mark Zuckerberg Talks: The Facebook CEO wrote a long-winded essay sharing his long-term vision for the social network that mainly covered the importance of a global community in an increasingly individualistic world. The purpose of the ""mission statement"" wasn't really clear since most government bodies in the U.S. and elsewhere don't have a problem with people connecting on the social network and there aren't any bans as such on people connecting even if they later turn out to be terrorists. Of course Facebook has access to a boatload of data on people that governments might ask for (as they have been doing).New Technology/ProductsFacebook Gets into Recruitment Services: Facebook has found another use for its sprawling network: it is now connecting employers with employees. While LinkedIn (now part of Microsoft) has been around for a while, the site is more popular with higher-income groups. Facebook on the other hand has people from every walk of life and employers of every kind on its network, so it's in a very good position to corner a much larger section of the market than LinkedIn ever reached.Google Loon Tech Improves: Google's Project Loon may get to market sooner now that the company has found a way of moving them more efficiently. According to a blog post from Astro Teller, head of its moonshots division called Google X, the company now has the algorithms necessary to direct groups of balloons from their point of launch to their points of deployment (remote area where Internet access is required) within a few weeks. Earlier this took a few months.The announcement was made after the company successfully launched its Internet beaming balloons from Puerto Rico and directed them towards Peru. The loon project is already testing in Sri Lanka and Peru although testing in Indonesia, the other country that has approved the project, is yet to commence.Amazon Echo, Google Home Taking Calls: The home automation devices from Google and AmazonAMZNmay soon be equipped with phone calling capabilities according to the WSJ, which cited its sources. The idea is to keep users away from their phones as much as possible when in the house, so they don't get distracted into using other services like Facebook. Or maybe it's just to help people get their calls even when they have both hands full.AWS Launches Chime: Amazon's AWS has launched a video conferencing software suite called Chime that competes with Microsoft's Skype for Business, Cisco's WebEx and others. Other than the basic version for which it doesn't charge, a Plus version with IT admin tools and screen-sharing comes for $2.50 per user per month and a Pro version that supports upto 100 attendees at $15. Microsoft charges $5 and $12.50 for the Office 365 Business Essentials and Business Premium packages, respectively. Cisco charges $69 on the basis of the number of hosts, irrespective of the number of attendees.HP-Sure Click: HP has collaborated with Bromium to introduce a hardware based security solution for unsafe Internet browsing. The solution, called HP Sure Click is activated every time a user accesses the browser, which then isolates the browsing session from other files/documents. So if malware or other malicious software opens up, other tabs or the system itself remains uninfected.M&A and CollaborationsMicrosoft Collaborates with India's Tata Motors: The two companies have inked a technology collaboration deal that will see MicrosoftMSFTdeliver its connected vehicle technologies (artificial intelligence, machine learning, IoT) through Azure.

Skift estimates that Google accounted for 90% of travel ads in 2016, generating $12 billion in revenue.

Could Apple Inc. (AAPL) Be The First Ever $1 Trillion Company?;2/22/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsI stumbled across a prediction last week that would impress even Mad Money's Jim Cramer.makeArticleAd();According to a recent report from Oxfam, an international charitable organization, Bill Gates has a shot at becoming the world's first trillionaire. Oxfam speculates that if the returns on the tech mogul's $75 billion fortune in the next 25 years are similar to those in the last 25 years, Gates has a shot at jumping the $1 trillion mark.That got me thinking, if one man has a shot at becoming a trillionaire, certainly one of theS&P 500′s biggest companies has a shot at becoming the world's first $1 trillion company?Turns out, a few do.I see five S&P 500 companies with a shot at breaking the $1 trillion mark in the next five years.-Facebook Inc(FB) is the smallest company on the list with a market cap of $386 billion. Facebook's share price would need to hit $345, up 159%.-Amazon.com, Inc.(AMZN) has a market cap of $400 billion. Shares would need to hit $1,980, up 125%.-Microsoft Corporation(MSFT) has a market cap of $498 billion. Shares would need to hit $130, up 100%.-Alphabet Inc(GOOG) is currently worth $570 billion. Shares would need to hit $1,431, up 70%.I believe every one of these companies will eventually be worth $1 trillion. However, one other company will beat them all to it.Thanks to a variety of factors,Apple Inc.(AAPL) is set to become the first $1 trillion company in the world in the next five years.The company has been on a roll. After beating fourth-quarter earnings by 4%, shares just hit a new all-time high above $135.That gives Apple a market cap of $710 billion, making it the largest company in the S&P 500. It has also placed Apple within striking distance of the $1 trillion mark. Shares of Apple would only need to climb 50% to $200 to give it a market cap of $1 trillion.7 Tech Stocks With Explosive Growth PotentialThat is well within reach.If its current valuation stayed the same, Apple would need to grow earnings by 8% annually in the next five years to hit that target. As it stands, Apple is expected to grow earnings by 8% this year and another 13% in 2018. Those two years alone get Apple almost half way to 50% earnings growth.But even if Apple's earnings grow slower than expected, it has an ace up its sleeve.Apple Has $246 Billion In Cash On Its Balance SheetApple's cash position is larger than the GDP of most countries. In recent fourth-quarter results, Apple's reported a cash position of $246 billion. Some of that cash is already accounted for in Apple's $700 billion valuation. But not all of it.Using as little as half of its cash balance to repurchase shares adds another $125 billion to Apple's market cap.Apple's Is One Of The Most Undervalued Stocks In The S&P 500Apple is one of the most undervalued stocks in the S&P 500. Its forward P/E ratio of 15 is a discount to the S&P 500s 20. That lower valuation exists despite the fact that Apple is projected to grow earnings faster than the S&P 500 in the next five years.Technically speaking that means Apple should be trading with a higher P/E ratio than the S&P 500. If Apple traded with the same P/E ratio as the S&P 500, shares would shares would climb 25%, giving Apple a market cap of $887 billion.Warren Buffett Just Made A Huge Investment In AppleApple's pursuit of the $1 trillion threshold has attracted the attention of the world's greatest investor. In recent regulatory filings, Berkshire revealed it had quadrupled its ownership in Apple to 57 million shares. Buffett's stake was worth approximately $6.6 billion at the end of 2016.With shares of Apple already up 17% on the year, Buffett has pocketed a quick $1.1 billion gain in less than six weeks.7 Dividend Stocks for the Retirement You DeserveRisks To Consider:Apple has struggled to launch new hits in the last few years. Although sales growth in its most important product the iPhone is still strong, Apple isn't the innovative company it was under Steve Jobs.Action To Take:Apple is on pace to become the world's first $1 trillion company. Even though shares are trading at an all-time high, I see plenty of growth and gains ahead. Buy shares anywhere below the all-time high and hold until Apple becomes the first $1 trillion company in the world.Editor's Note:Tech companieshave a history of turning stockholders, secretaries and even janitors into ""overnight"" millionaires.In 2017, innovations in virtual reality will do the same for owners of these 2 stocks…StreetAuthority's mission is to help individual investors earn above-average profits by providing a source of independent, unbiased - and most of all, profitable - investing ideas.

Can Amazon's Chime Challenge Microsoft's Skype and Cisco's Spark?;2/21/2017;"Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) recently introduced Chime, an  enterprise   collaboration service for online meetings, video conferencing,   voice calls, chat, and content sharing. Chime's apps work on iOS,   Android, Windows, and Mac, and the content is synchronized across   all platforms via Amazon Web Services (AWS).Chime comes in three versions -- Chime Basis, for 1:1 voice   and video calls and chat; Chime Plus, which adds screen sharing   and the integration of company directories; and Chime Pro, which   adds tools for scheduling, hosting, recording, and personalizing   meetings for up to 100 people.Image source: Amazon.makeArticleAd();These features indicate that Amazon is taking aim at   collaborative tools likeMicrosoft's(NASDAQ: MSFT) Skype andCisco's(NASDAQ: CSCO) Spark. But are those rivals already too deeply   entrenched in the enterprise market for Amazon to disrupt? Let's   take a closer look at Amazon's game plan to find out.Entering the crowded SaaS marketAmazon's AWS, which has an annual run rate of $14 billion, is   the  biggest cloud infrastructure platform in the world.   It's several times larger than its closest competitor,   Microsoft's Azure. But while AWS dominates the cloud platform   (infrastructure/platform as a service) market -- which hosts   storage space, processing power, and other tools for companies   and developers -- it doesn't have a major presence in the SaaS   (software as a service) market yet.The SaaS market is the crowded, consumer-facing side of the   cloud, which includes services like Microsoft's Office 365,   Dynamics CRM, and Skype. The lion's share of Microsoft's   commercialized cloud revenue run  rate of $14 billion is   generated by those SaaS products instead of Azure. Microsoft has   also been expanding Skype's capabilities as an enterprise   collaboration tool with  Microsoft Teams, which enhances   Skype's cloud-based communication features and tightly integrates   the service into Office 365.Microsoft Teams. Image source: Microsoft.Meanwhile, networking giant Cisco aggressively bundles   software and security products with its routers, switches, and   unified computing systems. Those bundles include collaboration   tools like Spark, the cloud-based platform for  messages,   meetings, and calls it launched in late 2015. Last quarter,   Cisco's collaboration revenues rose 4% annually to $1.06 billion   -- making it its third largest business after its  core   businesses of router and switches.But Microsoft and Cisco aren't the only players in the crowded   field of cloud-based collaborative tools.Alphabet's Google has been promoting Hangouts to enterprise customers   over  the past year,Boxhas added collaborative tools on top of its cloud storage   platform, andLogMeInacquiredCitrix's GoToMeeting video conferencing platform for the same purposes.   However, all these challengers notably lack Microsoft and Cisco's   clout in the enterprise market.That's why Amazon believes it can succeedBut like Microsoft and Cisco, Amazon also has leverage -- the   growing importance of AWS to enterprise customers. Amazon likely   believes that by offering Chime as an extension of AWS   (especially with its 30-day free trial) to its enterprise   customer base, it can gain a foothold in the crowded ""unified   communication"" platform market.Amazon previously launched enterprise SaaS products like    WorkSpaces, WorkDocs, and WorkMail, but it hasn't ever   released official growth figures for those products. However,   most industry watchers believe that those products are still   dwarfed by comparable solutions from Microsoft and Cisco. This   strongly indicates that AWS' dominance of the PaaS/IaaS markets   doesn't guarantee that Chime will become a Skype or Spark killer   anytime soon. Chime Pro also  costs more than Skype for   Business -- so it doesn't look like Amazon plans to undercut its   way into the market.The key takeawayChime sounds like a logical way for AWS to straddle the   PaaS/IaaS and SaaS markets, but it's easier said than done. The   market for cloud-based unified communication platforms is   incredibly crowded, and it's doubtful that a new service -- even   one bundled with AWS -- can claim a meaningful slice of the   market. However, Amazon investors should still keep an eye out   for future SaaS products to see if the company can eventually   challenge heavyweights like Microsoft and Cisco.10 stocks we like better than MicrosoftWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

SaaSy B2B Sales Are in the Clouds;2/21/2017;"My pet project the last six months has been to learn everything I can about Facebook (FB) advertising. Let me explain why I chose that specific niche.I decided last year that it would be counter-productive to try and master the understanding of too many areas of technology. Between industry areas like big data, cloud computing, artificial intelligence and robotics there are hundreds of companies with dozens of different business models and customers.After looking at those four related areas, I also decided that the best way to conquer the investment puzzle would be to simply buy the four most important players who will likely dictate the future markets for those technologies. Those four companies I profiled in my June Zacks Confidential reportBig Economic Disruption: Big Data, AI, & Robotics.They were Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), and IBM. To me, keep it simple and just own the powerhouses who were already investing heavily in those areas, while also busy swallowing up advanced tech and startups before the other guy.And the competition is heated as tech titans clash with war chests of cash. A fifth name could have been Cisco (CSCO), the arms dealer for the infrastructure of the Internet. Last month, they plunked down $3.7 billion for a software company that was within days of going public.You can read about that ""buzzer beater"" in my January 27 articleCisco Snatches IPO Baby from the Arms of Wall Street.Why Facebook Advertising?So with all this ""battle of the tech titans"" going on, why settle on the boring niche of FB ads? Two reasons: first, it was easier to understand and more tangible than all the different things Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and IBM were doing. And second, something explosive and fascinating occurred last year in Facebook when they grew ad revenue to $26.5 billion, representing 55% annual growth.I wanted to know what was driving that growth. And I was very intrigued to find it was a whole new world of marketing and sales freedom for small and medium-sized businesses around the world.Giving access to the little guy to advertising power that formerly belonged only to big corporations didn't just steal market share from the pie that Google Adwords had baked in the past decade.It created a much bigger pie altogether as local businesses, online marketers, and digital nomads found magic in the FB Power Editor to target ad campaigns, audiences and even their ad budgets.Study SaaSy SalesThe universe of technology is changing exponentially. Disruption is the norm for most industries. But one way to keep it interesting and engaging is to pick a software company and learn more about their business, customers and vendors.In the video that accompanies this article, I show a jungle of companies and industries related to SaaS (software-as-a-service) providers and cloud computing.Along the theme of marketing and sales ""SaaS for the little guy,"" ala Facebook, I really like the business model of HubSpot (HUBS) who claims to have invented ""inbound"" marketing solutions where leads are generated online and then nurtured through email campaigns to eventually drive customer conversions.HUBS offers a free CRM to lure clients in. And speaking of CRM, be sure to watch my video where I tell the story of the war of words between Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Salesforce.com CEO Marc Benioff over the former's bid for LinkedIn.A private competitor in this space is Infusionsoft. You have probably noticed a link or two from an email, landing page or autoresponder that was being driven by Infusionsoft.Getting Giggy TooAnd some of the most exciting companies to study are those involved with services in the ""sharing"" or ""gig"" economy.While Angie's List invented the model 20 years ago, and CraigsList keep it ""underground,"" plenty of money is being invested by VC in new freelancer portals like Upwork, TaskRabbit, and Thumbtack.Thumbtack raised over $200 million in 2015 from Google Ventures and Sequoia. And just this year, Australia's Airtasker nailed a Series B funding round worth $23 million.Be sure to watch my video to get more details on all these industries and trends.

Why 42% Of Schwab Investors Are On The Prowl For Stocks;2/21/2017;"Investors know what they like, and they liked the November election results and December's interest-rate increase by the Federal Reserve.Those events prompted a jump in investors who have retail accounts withCharles Schwab(SCHW) to declare themselves bullish. In a fourth-quarter survey of those investors, Schwab found 42% of them said they now feel bullish. That was a big jump up from the 34% who felt that way in Q4 a year earlier.makeArticleAd();""As a result of the election, clients saw an increased prospect for a reduction in personal and corporate tax rates, an increased likelihood of spending on infrastructure, and an increased likelihood of a reduction in regulatory burdens for some industries,"" said Myhanh Hoskin, a Schwab financial consultant, who is based in Seal Beach, Calif. ""The rate increase was a sign of growing strength in the economy.""Amid that widespread perception that the stock market had become increasingly worth investing in, Schwab investors did as much buying as selling in the quarter.The top five U.S. holdings among all Schwab stock mutual funds wereApple(AAPL),Microsoft(MSFT),Exxon Mobil(XOM),Johnson & Johnson(JNJ) andJPMorgan Chase(JPM) as of Feb. 16, according to Morningstar Inc.Apple is up 17% year to date, while Microsoft is up 4%, Exxon is down 10%, Johnson & Johnson is up 3%, and JPMorgan is up 5%.In Schwab's survey of its clients, the general balance between buying and selling bodes well for the market in additional ways. ""It shows there isn't a sense of euphoria,"" Hoskin said. ""It shows caution by many investors. And that suggests that we're not seeing a market top. That is a good thing. When you have too many people doing the same thing, that tends to be a contrarian indicator.""On the other hand, only 13% of investors said their top concern about the market is that it appears overdue for a correction, suggesting a tone of overconfidence.In contrast, a whopping 88% said they are confident about reaching their financial goals.Allocations And OutlookInvestors had 41.3% of their money in stocks, 21.1% in cash, 18.8% in mutual funds, 11.9% in exchange traded funds, and 6.9% in fixed income.And 21% of those investors said they planned to move more money into stocks during the current first quarter.Stocks were the most popular planned destination for additional allocations.ETFs were the second most popular target asset, with 17% of investors saying that's where they planned to put more money.Mutual funds were the third most popular, with 15% of investors saying they would move money into them in Q1.Investors were more inclined to get help in making investment decisions. The number of clients seeking planning advice rose 10% from a year earlier.RELATED:How This Mutual Fund Is Lighting Up Retirement AccountsAre Fidelity's Recent Stock Buys And Sells Retirement Account Hot Sauce?"

These Are the 10-Most Admired Companies in the World;2/21/2017;"When the public votes for something the results can skew based   on perception, emotion, or sometimes even the desire to mess with   the outcome.That's how a $300 million state-of-the-art British polar   research ship earned the name ""Boaty McBoatface."" The question of   the ship's name was put to an internet vote, and while over 7,000   names were submitted, according toCNN, ""Boaty McBoatface"" won easily with 124,109 votes. Votes being   open to the public have given us many questionable,   past-their-prime Major League Baseball all-stars, as well as a   whale being tracked by Greenpeace being named Mr. Splashy   Pants.These are all ridiculous votes skewed by a playful public, but   they illustrate that sometimes open voting can produce less-than   reliable results. In creating its annualMost-Admired Companies ListFortune does not leave the question open to a public vote,   instead the publication works with its partner Korn Ferry Hay   Group to build a list and then survey executives from the   companies that make the initial cut.makeArticleAd();Image source: Getty.After starting with about 1,500 candidates (the 1,000 largest   U.S. companies ranked by revenue, along with non-U.S. companies   in Fortune's Global 500 database that have revenues of $10   billion or more), the selections are cut down to the   highest-revenue companies in each industry. That leaves 680   companies in 28 countries, and 3,800 insiders affiliated with   those companies voted on the list.""To determine the best-regarded companies in 51 industries,   Korn Ferry Hay Group asked executives, directors, and analysts to   rate enterprises in their own industry on nine criteria, from   investment value and quality of management and products to social   responsibility and ability to attract talent,"" Fortune explained.   This, as you can see, is not a fan vote, but an insider's   perspective on which companies are most admired by their own   executives, competitors, and people who should actually know.Apple topped the list of most-admired companies. Image     source: Apple.Which companies are the most admired?Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL)Amazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN)Starbucks(NASDAQ: SBUX)Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK-A) (NYSE: BRK-B)Disney(NYSE: DIS)Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL)General Electric(NYSE: GE)Southwest Airlines(NYSE: LUV)(Tie)Facebook(NASDAQ: FB) /Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT)Why is making this list important?While there's no definitive benefit to making a list             like this, there's a clear value in being well-regarded             by industry insiders. The 10 companies above are not             only successful, but those best-placed to judge are             saying they admire them, which should be taken as a             strong positive by shareholders and potential             investors.""Having the respect of your peers and your             competitors is absolutely crucial in business and             almost everywhere else,"" said Fortune's Assistant             Managing Editor Nicholas Varchaver in avideothat accompanied the list. ""Fortune's World's             Most-Admired Company's List is a list that embodies             precisely that idea.""This isn't a popularity contest or a thrown-off             quick vote. It's a fairly in-depth look at the             companies most-admired by business leaders. Making the             list suggests that these are brands that do things the             right way, companies with solid foundations likely to             not only be around for the long haul, but to continue             to thrive.Being held in this type of high regard by your             competitors may also come with actual advantages.             In-demand workers are likely to want to work for             companies they admire. The brands on this list likely             have an easier time recruiting top talent because they             are thought of this way and in competitive markets like             coders, top technology executives, and sales leaders,             that can be the difference between staying on top and             slipping to the back of the pack.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a               stock tip, it can pay to listen.

But one way to keep it interesting and engaging is to pick a software company and learn more about their business, customers and vendors.In the video that accompanies this article, I show a jungle of companies and industries related to SaaS (software-as-a-service) providers and cloud computing.Along the theme of marketing and sales ""SaaS for the little guy,"" ala Facebook, I really like the business model of HubSpot (HUBS) who claims to have invented ""inbound"" marketing solutions where leads are generated online and then nurtured through email campaigns to eventually drive customer conversions.HUBS offers a free CRM to lure clients in. And speaking of CRM, be sure to watch my video where I tell the story of the war of words between Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Salesforce.com CEO Marc Benioff over the former's bid for LinkedIn.A private competitor in this space is Infusionsoft. You have probably noticed a link or two from an email, landing page or autoresponder that was being driven by Infusionsoft.Getting Giggy TooAnd some of the most exciting companies to study are those involved with services in the ""sharing"" or ""gig"" economy.While Angie's List invented the model 20 years ago, and CraigsList keeps it ""underground,"" plenty of money is being invested by VC in new freelancer portals like Upwork, TaskRabbit, and Thumbtack.Thumbtack raised over $200 million in 2015 from Google Ventures and Sequoia. And just this year, Australia's Airtasker nailed a Series B funding round worth $23 million.Be sure to watch my video to get more details on all these industries and trends.

What's in the Cards for Workiva (WK) this Earnings Season?;2/21/2017;"Workiva Inc.WKis set to release its fourth-quarter 2016 earnings on Feb 23. In the last quarter, the company reported a positive earnings surprise of 25.58%. We note that the company has delivered positive surprises in each of the last four quarters resulting in an average positive surprise of 23.97%.The company reported a non-GAAP net loss of 32 cents per share in third-quarter 2016 that was narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 43 cents.Workiva offers a cloud-based and mobile-enabled platform, Wdesk for enterprises to collect, manage, report and analyze critical business data in real time. The company reported a loss of 32 cents per share in the third-quarter that was narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate that stood at a loss of 43 cents.However, improving results failed to provide significant momentum to the share price. We note that Workiva has underperformed the ZacksInternet Softwareindustry over the last one year. While the industry gained 18.5%, the stock returned only 11.2% over the same period.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderWorkiva recently announced that its Wdesk platform enjoyed steady demand as evident from the fact that companies like Meredith Corporation and MFA Cornerstone Consulting continued to use the platform to streamline their collaborations and enhance compliance efficiencies.The company collaborated with Frazier and Deeter so as to help the latter upgrade its risk, governance and compliance processes through the use of Wdesk. Also, Workiva partnered with Business Wire to enable its Wdesk platform users seamlessly file their SEC reports.In October, the Wdesk platform was adopted by the State University System of Florida for streamlining tuition and fees reporting.We can surmise that Workiva's Wdesk platform is gaining traction in the market, which remains a positive for the company and the impact is likely to be reflected in its bottom line in the soon-to-be reported quarter.However, a competitive landscape with the presence of major document creation vendors such as MicrosoftMSFTand Google remains a concern for Workiva in the soon-to-be reported quarter.Earnings Whispers?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Workiva is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positiveEarnings ESPand a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

Virtual Reality Was a Flop in 2016. Will 2017 Be the Year It Takes Off?;2/20/2017;"Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();Consumer-level virtual reality (VR) received its first big   push in 2016 with major headset launches fromFacebook(NASDAQ: FB) ,HTC(NASDAQOTH: HTCCY) , andSony(NYSE: SNE) , but uptake for the technology fell short of many   analysts' expectations, and there are a range of challenges that   threaten to limit future adoption. Sales for Facebook's   Oculus Rift and HTC's Vive headsets dried up after their   respective launches, and SuperData cut its 2016 sales estimate   for Sony's PlayStation VR from 2.6 million units to 745,000 units   -- potentially worrying signs for the future of head-mounted   displays.VR still has compelling prospects, but it's also clear that   the technology will have to overcome certain roadblocks before   it's ready for prime time. In order to better understand the   potential growth trajectory for virtual reality in 2017 and   beyond, let's take a look at some of the factors that are shaping   the progression of the technology.More affordable, but not cheap enoughThe fact thatSamsung's Gear VR -- which uses compatible cellphones for its display   and retails at $99 -- is the top-selling headset suggests that   price will continue to be a key hurdle for higher-end virtual   reality adoption. The Oculus Rift still sells for $599, while the   Vive is priced at $799, and the PlayStation VR retails at $399.   In addition to a growing list of compatible phones for Gear VR   and Alphabet's Google Daydream platform, more headsets will hit   the market in 2017 and fill in the gaps between high- and low-end   experiences. Increased competition should put pressure on   Facebook, HTC, and Sony to lower the prices for their devices or   improve value propositions through bundling and other   promotions.Lenovois expected to release a headset this year that delivers higher   resolution than the Rift or the Vive, a lighter weight, and   augmented reality (AR) capabilities -- all at a sub-$400 price.   Lenovo's device will be part ofMicrosoft's(NASDAQ: MSFT) Windows Holographic virtual reality ecosystem,   and make use of a dual-camera internal tracking system (as   opposed to the external systems used by the Vive, Oculus Rift,   and PS VR) that could be instrumental in the emergence of more   affordable headsets. Windows Holographic headsets will reportedly   start in the $300 price range and are being designed to be   compatible with mid-range computers -- moves that should make   virtual reality more accessible and build Microsoft's position in   the space. Companies including Asus,Acer,HP, and Dell are also developing entries for the Windows   Holographic virtual reality platform, though it's not clear   which, if any, will launch this year.Even with new entrants, the cost of high-end VR will likely   continue to be prohibitive to mass-market adoption, but reports   that Facebook is closing 200 out of 500 Oculus Rift demo stations   atBest Buylocations due to low engagement suggests other obstacles to VR   going mainstream this year.VR isn't going to break out yetWhile new competition means the cost of entry for mid-level   and high-end virtual devices is likely to fall this year, a   growing selection of headsets will contribute to the trend of   fragmentation that threatens to limit the progression of VR.   Early competition to establish leadership in the space and   technological differences between high-end and low-end   devices have created a situation where many software   offerings are not compatible across devices. Fragmenting even   exists within individual platforms, with Oculus Rift developers   needing to account for segmentation created by the introduction   of the device's touch-based controllers.For now, VR hardware lacks a ""killer app"" to justify the cost   of entry, and the dynamics of the current market present barriers   to the arrival of breakthrough software. With small and fractured   installed bases for VR headsets, developing big-budget virtual   reality experiences still doesn't make sense for most developers,   and that issue is likely to persist through 2017. Even Sony, a   platform holder with wide range of video game development   studios, seems to have few projects on the horizon to support its   headset. Without standout software experiences to hook users and   encourage engagement with the new display mediums, the high cost   of entry will remain prohibitive to the mass market audience.Future potentialWhile early uptake for VR has been disappointing compared to   initial projections, it's important to remember just how young   this technology is. The overly optimistic forecasts for VR   adoption in 2016 give cause for some skepticism when looking at   future targets, but expectations for huge growth in the category   persist, with a study fromCitigroupestimating that the combined market for VR and AR will reach   $2.16 trillion by 2035.Despite initial roadblocks, the immersive potential offered by   VR and AR and improvements to hardware and software make it   likely that the technology will eventually achieve mass adoption.   Last year marked the beginning of the consumer VR push, and,   while it doesn't look like 2017 will deliver the confluence of   factors needed to propel the medium into the mainstream, the   long-term outlook remains very bright.The early adopter market is mostly buying VR for video games,   but the technology will eventually be bridged to online shopping   and other uses, and the immersive qualities of AR and VR should   open up huge advertising opportunities that help build support   for the new mediums.10 stocks we like better than MicrosoftWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

How the Leaders of Enterprise Management SaaS are Growing;2/19/2017;"The battle for space in the Enterprise Management Software or Business Management Software segment has gotten a bit intense of late, with Salesforce (CRM), Oracle (ORCL), Microsoft (MSFT) and SAP (SAP) fighting to increase their market share.Salesforce is the only niche player in the segment, with a heavy focus on the Customer Relationship Management segment. The company came from behind to beat leaders of the segment, Oracle and SAP, and have more than $6 billion in annual revenues to show for their efforts. The CRM market is estimated to reach $36.5 billion in size in 2017, with Salesforce in pole position.makeArticleAd();Oracle has recently upped its focus on this segment, as the company wants to race against Salesforce to be the first SaaS/PaaS provider to reach ten billion dollars in annual SaaS sales. Oracle is more of a horizontal player in the segment, with hands in CRM, ERP, HCM and SCM. The company recently bought Netsuite for $9.3 billion because it gave them a solid footing in the cloud ERP market.During the second quarter of 2017 Oracle had $878 million in revenue from its SaaS and PaaS units, a growth of 81% compared the to the prior period. To hit ten billion dollars in revenue their quarterly revenues have to go over $2.5 billion. Even if the company were to continue its current growth rate, it will easily take them two more years to get there. It's possible, but Oracle has to remain aggressive if its wants to beat Salesforce to $10 billion, because Salesforce revenue grew 25% during the recent third quarter results to reach $2.14 billion, with subscription and support revenue touching $1.983 billion.But whoever gets there first is only going to get the bragging rights, and nothing more. The fact remains that Salesforce is still a very strong player in its niche and will stay that way for a long time. Oracle is astutely going after multiple areas in the enterprise management software segment because a head to head collision is only going to slow things down for them.Microsoft is also slowly beefing up its capabilities in the enterprise management segment through Dynamics. It is the smallest player of the three right now, but Microsoft has nothing to lose by moving into a segment they see as a natural extension of their office collaboration suite of products. Thanks to Office 365 and its growing portfolio of offerings, it makes sense to dig deeper and wider into the enterprise market with asset management tools.Moreover, with LinkedIn, they're sitting at arm's length from millions of businesses that are potential clients, so it's natural for the software maker to drive their strategy in that direction. In fact, that was very likely their intention behind acquiring the professional network in the first place.The enterprise management software market is dominated by large vendors, with some niche players in the mix. Due to the size and growth pace of the segment, all of them will be able to show revenue growth in a sustainable manner.Disclosure:I have no positions in the stock mentioned above and no intention to initiate a position in the next 72 hours.Premium MembersThis article first appeared onGuruFocus."

More Bullish, Schwab Investors Are On The Prowl For Stocks;2/17/2017;"Investors know what they like, and they liked the November   election results and December's interest-rate increase by the   Federal Reserve.Those events prompted a jump in investors who have retail   accounts withCharles Schwab(SCHW) to declare themselves bullish. In a fourth-quarter survey of   those investors, Schwab found 42% of them said they now feel   bullish. That was a big jump up from the 34% who felt that way in   Q4 a year earlier.""As a result of the election, clients saw an increased   prospect for a reduction in personal and corporate tax rates, an   increased likelihood of spending on infrastructure, and an   increased likelihood of a reduction in regulatory burdens for   some industries,"" said Myhanh Hoskin, a Schwab financial   consultant, who is based in Seal Beach, Calif. ""The rate increase   was a sign of growing strength in the economy.""makeArticleAd();Amid that widespread perception that the stock market had   become increasingly worth investing in, Schwab investors did as   much buying as selling in the quarter.The top five U.S. holdings among all Schwab stock mutual funds   wereApple(AAPL),Microsoft(MSFT),Exxon Mobil(XOM),Johnson & Johnson(JNJ) andJPMorgan Chase(JPM) as of Feb. 16, according to Morningstar Inc.Apple is up 17% year to date, while Microsoft is up 4%, Exxon   is down 10%, Johnson & Johnson is up 3%, and JPMorgan is up   5%.In Schwab's survey of its clients, the general balance between   buying and selling bodes well for the market in additional ways.

VMware, Inc. (VMW) Keeps the Momentum Going;2/17/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsVMware, Inc.(NYSE:VMW) may not be one of the first companies that comes to mind when you're thinking about cloud services stocks. But, it should be.makeArticleAd();Source:FlickrBelieve it or not, VMW is one of the top enterprise cloud services and virtualization companies out there. And, its growth up to now, while impressive, is just the beginning. In the past 12 months, VMW stock has almost doubled.That sounds compelling, but the underlying story is what makes VMW's rise something you should understand, especially if you're looking for exposure in this massively disruptive market.Simply put, cloud computing means that your computer doesn't need to have individual software packages for each specific job you want it to do. In the old days, you ran a word processing program, a spreadsheet program, a design program, etc. And, every machine had to have its individual software suite.The rise of networked computers meant that all of this software could be stored on a network ""library"" and each user could access what they needed.7 Tech Stocks That Could Implode at Any MinuteThe next iteration of these networks were housed in the ""cloud,"" which simply implies a virtual space built into servers. One of the primary advantages is the ability to access your information from the cloud, regardless of where you are or what computer you're using.Cloud computing has been around for a long time, and companies such asAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL),Microsoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT),Oracle Corporation(NYSE:ORCL) andAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) have been using the cloud for many years.Now, companies of all sizes are migrating to the cloud, and within the cloud universe there both public clouds (where many people have access) and private clouds (where only select people have access). VMW provides the ability to develop each of these systems, and also facilitates unique access between public and private clouds.Why Don't We Hear Much About VMware?VMWare is actually owned byDell Technologies Inc(NYSE:DVMT) subsidiary,EMC Corporation(NYSE:EMC). Last April, Dell bought EMC to become the largest privately-held tech company in the world. So, VMWare is a cloud-based, publicly-traded branch of this major tech player now.Part of the reason you don't hear about VMWare as much as its competitors is because the company's relationship to its owners is a bit convoluted, and analysts aren't very confident in figuring out how to value VMW stock. Their loss is your gain.3 Stocks to Buy for Under $10 With 25%-Plus UpsideQ4 and full-year numbers were posted in late January, and they show how strong VMW stock remains. Earnings beat analyst expectations and revenue continued to grow at a solid clip. A new strategic partnership with AMZN's cloud-computing juggernaut, Amazon Web Services (AWS), adds some serious firepower to the VMW arsenal. It also helps the company remain competitive in a very dynamic field.When you have a tech parent like EMC and a tech partner like AWS, you are doing very well. These brands are major players in the enterprise sector and will open even more doors for VMW in the future.

Apple Inc. (AAPL) May Have Different View On Trump’s iPhone Manufacturing Plans;2/17/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsApple Inc.(AAPL) does not mind making Trump furious.makeArticleAd();The U.S. President has been targeting Apple's low-energy and economically-sensible overseasmanufacturingsince the beginning. Even though the iPhone maker has so far stayed away from this debate, recent comments from CFO Luca Maestri suggest that the U.S. firm has no plans of closing up shop in China any time soon, according toBGR.In response to a question about overseas manufacturing at a Goldman Sachs conference, Maestri said, ""One of the points that we are making in Washington is the fact that we have been a very large contributor to the US economy during the last decade. We made billions ofinvestmentsin the United States. In the last 10 years, we created about 2 million jobs in this country - in the developer community in our retail stores in our call centers and through the supplier chain.""Maestri then talked about Apple's U.S.-located call centers, adding that speculating on Apple's manufacturing plans is really difficult, especially when Trump hasn't outlined any specific policies.He did note that imposition of a border tax on imported products would lead to an additional burden on the end consumer.This could also mean that Apple is making yet another attempt to take iPhone manufacturing off the table for discussions with Trump. It seems that the iPhone maker does not mind taking back ancillary services, such as support centers, back to the US, but it doesn't want to move the entire iPhone supply chain, notes BGR.Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock Could Win Big With 'Windows Cloud'Apple's iPhone manufacturing has been in the news for quite some time now.Reportedly, Apple asked its subsidiaries to examine the feasibility of iPhone manufacturing soon after Trump's electoral victory.

Apple to Begin Assembling iPhone SE in India from April;2/17/2017;"makeZacksArticleAd();Reportedly,Apple Inc.AAPLin collaboration with its manufacturer, Wistron Inc. will begin to assemble iPhone SE in India starting this April. The plant will be located in the state of Karnataka in south India.Though there is no official word on the matter from Apple or Wistron, it has been reported that initially the Cupertino giant wants to assemble 0.3-0.4 million units of iPhone SE. Apple hasn't even waited for the numerous tax concessions that it sought from the India government including the 15-year customs duty holiday.Analysts observe that it was prudent on part of Apple to begin assembling its most economic iPhone offering, SE, which was launched to cater to cost sensitive markets like India. Plus, it also will support future iOS upgrades unlike iPhone 5S, which will soon be discontinued in most of the markets including India.Apple Inc. PriceApple Inc. Price|Apple Inc. QuoteWhy is Apple Keen on India?Since the last year, Apple has been increasing its focus on India to claim a greater share of the vast smartphone market, of which it reportedly holds only 2% as of now. Apple faces slowing iPhone demand in most of the regions, either because of competition or regulatory hurdles (China) or market saturation (the U.S). Therefore, it makes sense for the company to solidify its position in India, which is projected to become the second largest smartphone market in the world. In fiscal 2016, Apple sales in India grew approximately 50% over the prior fiscal.Furthermore, a younger (and skilled) population and increasing investment in broadband network by the government also make India an attractive growth opportunity for Apple over the long run. In fact, the government under PM Narendra Modi is eager to bring foreign capital and boost manufacturing facilities in India.The recently outlined FDI policy also bodes well for the company as it eliminates the requirement to locally source products for at least a three-year period. This will enable Apple to open its solely-owned retails stores in India. Thereafter, the company will have to comply with the rule. The company has also partnered with telecom company Reliance, which is providing its Jio (a unique all-IP network) service for free with the new iPhones.Last year, Tim Cook was on a charm offensive in India. Besides meeting Modi, he also announced the opening of an iOS App Design and Development Accelerator in Bengaluru and a map development office in another southern Indian city, Hyderabad in collaboration with regional firm RMSI.ChallengesThe market is highly cost sensitive. Reportedly, majority of the smartphones sold are priced around INR 10K (roughly $145). iPhone 7 on the other hand costs almost five times more. Even iPhone SE is priced at INR 30K. The lion's share of Apple's revenues in the country comes from devices, which are a couple of generations old. Newer models have relatively low demand given the hefty price tag.  A few days back, it was reported that the Apple team in India is trying to increase revenues to $3 billion by 2017-18 and by local assembling operations, the company can start to operate its own retail outlets and avail a 10% tax benefit. This should lower prices.Plus, Apple's rival Samsung along with a few Chinese smartphone makers dominates this market. Samsung has long been in the market and with reportedly 23% share, it is a leading player in the country. Apple is quite late to the party.Also, Apple's lack of focus on regional customers' demand is a concern. India is categorized by handsets that work on dual SIMs. Apparently, Apple is not keen on making dual SIM handsets. This could be a very big impediment to growth in the country.Also, analysts observe that Apple is ""relocating"" manufacturing to India from China, given rising labor costs. However another analyst argues that though labor is cheap compared with China, productivity is relatively better in China. Simple assembling may not drastically bring down prices. However, the creation of a local supply chain as in China will be a big positive.Despite the pros and cons, Apple is expected to continue its India drive.

Better Buy: Microsoft Corporation vs. Oracle Corporation;2/17/2017;"Co-founder and Chief Technology Officer Larry Ellison   describesOracle(NYSE: ORCL) as a cloud leader to be reckoned with, and he may be   right -- eventually. But today it'sMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) at the top of the cloud heap. But Oracle's late   start -- thanks to Ellison's early dismissal of cloud computing   as nothing more than ""the latest fashion"" -- could work in   investors' favor because it translates to tremendous upside from   here.Meanwhile, Microsoft's decision to name Satya Nadella as CEO   three years ago has proven to be an absolute game changer.   Microsoft's stock was meandering under former chief Steve   Ballmer, but no longer. Nadella has changed Microsoft's business   focus as well as its culture -- and it's working.So which stock is the better buy? Let's take a look.makeArticleAd();Image source: Oracle.The case for OracleOracle's fiscal second quarter (ended Nov. 30) was one to   remember as it relates to cloud results. For the first time,   Oracle's combined cloud Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS),   Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), and infrastructure revenues topped   the $1 billion mark. PaaS and SaaS revenue climbed 81% last   quarter  to $878 million.Cloud Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) couldn't match the   growth rate of Oracle's skyrocketing SaaS and PaaS results, but   its revenue still climbed 6% to $175 million, bringing total   cloud sales to $1.05 billion, equal to 12% of Oracle's $9 billion   in total revenue last quarter. For some perspective, a year ago   Oracle reported $649 million in cloud revenue, which equaled just   7% of its $8.99 billion in total sales.Oracle has quickly become a software vendor of note outside   the cloud, too. Its legacy hardware and related support sales of   $1 billion notched a 10% decline from a year ago, which can be   attributed to Oracle's shift to up-and-coming opportunities along   with the inevitable slowing of ""old-school"" enterprise hardware   markets.Though software and license sales declined 4% last quarter,   when combined with cloud revenue -- an Oracle earnings report   staple nowadays -- the $7.2 billion was a 2% year-over-year   improvement. Better still, and something worth watching for when   Oracle reports estimated third-quarter earnings on March 13, is   that combined cloud and software revenue now accounts for 80% of   all sales, up from 78% a year ago.Image source: Microsoft.The case for MicrosoftSimilar to Oracle, Microsoft's cloud results are centered on   SaaS. According toGartner, overall SaaS cloud revenue jumped $36 billion to $144 billion   in 2016. SaaS is forecast to grow at an annual rate of 37%   through 2020, and Microsoft is leading the charge. The only cloud   segment expected to grow faster than SaaS are business process   sales, at 43% per year, which is another key to Microsoft's   stellar results.Last quarter, Microsoft's cloud annual revenue run rate was   more than $14 billion, led by commercial Office 365 sales, its   Azure platform, and Dynamics CRM. Azure, which is Microsoft's   PaaS for delivering cloud solutions, soared 93%. Despite its   rapid cloud growth, Microsoft is controlling costs.Total revenue increased just 1.2% last quarter to $24 billion,   but net income grew nearly 4% to $5.2 billion. With about 200   million fewer shares outstanding and the company managing   expenses, Microsoft's $0.66-per-share earnings was a 6.5%   increase, and that included a negative $0.01 hit from the   LinkedIn acquisition.So, which is the better buy?In addition to being further along in its cloud transition   than Oracle, Microsoft has multiple revenue drivers including the   LinkedIn assets and the data that comes with it. And Microsoft is   leading the race to dominate augmented reality (AR), a market   expected to generate $83 billion by 2021 compared to virtual   reality's (VR) $25 billion.Oracle is on the right path, and its 1.5% dividend yield is   respectable. However, considering Microsoft's cloud and AR   leadership positions, a dividend yield of 2.5%, data analytics   driven by artificial intelligence (AI), Bing search, and OS   leadership positions, it all adds up to Microsoft as the better   buy.10 stocks we like better than OracleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock       tip, it can pay to listen.

Meet The 'Fastest-Growing' $1 Billion Enterprise Software Firm;2/17/2017;"Technology investors looking for high revenue growth often   find their answer in software-as-a-service companies.ServiceNow(NOW) is one of the fastest-growing companies that fits that   bill. ServiceNow's 2016 sales exploded 38% to $1.4 billion,   and it has laid claim to being the ""fastest-growing enterprise   software company with more than $1 billion in revenue.""[ibdchart symbol=""NOW"" type=""daily"" size=""threequarter""   position=""leftchart"" ]It has set big goals, too. The Santa Clara,   Calif.-based company plans to nearly triple its revenue   to $4 billion by 2020.makeArticleAd();""There's not another company that produces growth at our scale   like we do,"" Frank Slootman, ServiceNow's chief executive, said   in an interview. ""It's a trifecta - scale, growth and free   cash flow.""ServiceNow faces fierce competition, though, most notably fromSalesforce.com(CRM), currently the market leader in the industry known as SaaS.   Salesforce.com's 2016 sales boomed 24% to $6.7 billion, and the   San Francisco-based company is on track to hit $10 billion in   revenue for the current fiscal year. It's aiming to hit $20   billion after that.Salesforce.com has the higher profile, being oft-mentioned in   industry merger activity, whether it involvesMicrosoft(MSFT), LinkedIn,Twitter(TWTR) or another company. It specializes in software that helps   businesses organize and handle sales operations.But ServiceNow stock has shot up 25% in 2017, while   Salesforce.com is up 18% after lagging last year.How It WorksSaaS companies sell online subscriptions to software, rather   than one-time licenses. SaaS providers have high customer renewal   rates and book recurring revenue over the long term. Most sell   into the so-called ""enterprise market"" - large companies,   government agencies and other big customers.ServiceNow has prospered by taking away the customers of BMC   Software,Hewlett Packard Enterprise(HPE),CA Technologies(CA) and other ""on-premise"" software providers that shifted slowly   to cloud-based SaaS business models.Founded in 2004, ServiceNow developed software for information   technology service management, basically IT help-desk tools for   tracking internal company issues. As Salesforce.com has expanded   into marketing, customer service and e-commerce, ServiceNow has   made a similar push into customer-service tools, heightening the   rivalry between the two.Salesforce.com has been an acquisition machine, spending more   than $4.6 billion in 2016 alone to buy companies.In ServiceNow's case, though, it can hit its $4 billion target   by growing ""organically,"" meaning without big acquisitions, says   Alex Zukin, a Piper Jaffray analyst.""There may be opportunities for them to enhance the breadth of   their offerings with (small) tuck-in acquisitions,"" Zukin   added.New MarketsServiceNow expects to reach its $4 billion revenue goal by   expanding into new markets - human resources, customer service   management and security, to name a few - and by landing bigger   contracts while targeting the top 2,000 global companies.ServiceNow has bought small companies like Neebula Systems,   iTapp and most recently DxContinuum to acquire ""talent and   technology,"" said Slootman, who has been ServiceNow's CEO since   2011. He earlier headed Data Domain, which was sold to data   storage networking giant EMC in 2009.""Technology is not as useful without the talent,"" Slootman   said. ""We have the ability to sell, so I don't need to acquire   revenue or customers. We can do that ourselves. We try to acquire   small companies with promising technology before they go vertical   and their revenue explodes, because then it's way more expensive   (to acquire them).""ServiceNow still garners most revenue from service management,   but the 2014 Neebula acquisition provided key technology for   mapping a customers' IT infrastructure in case outages or other   problems occur. That's a different market, called IT operations   management. ServiceNow's 2016 purchase of ITApp provided cloud   management tools.ServiceNow's operations management tools account for about 9%   of subscription revenue, with that expected to grow to at least   15% by 2020.Common GroundSlootman says the same software tools that automate   information-technology workflows and record keeping can be   applied for finance, legal, procurement and other corporate   departments. Like Salesforce.com, ServiceNow is building a   library of business apps that customers can download via the   internet.The name of the game for many SaaS companies is building a   cloud ""platform"" so they can sell multiple software tools to   different industries.IBD'S TAKE:After a series offlat basesover the last 10 months, ServiceNow broke out last month and is     staking out higher ground above the 90 level. ServiceNow is theeighth-ranked companyin IBD's Computer Software-Enterprise Group. Tops on the list     isPaycom Software(PAYC), which has aComposite Rating of 95out of a possible 99.""In software everyone claims to be a platform play, but in   reality there are only a few that can make that claim, and   ServiceNow is one of them,"" said Matthew Hedberg, a RBC Capital   analyst in a report.Much of ServiceNow's revenue growth has come from   ""cross-selling."" Its sales staff aims to sell more products to   existing service management customers. IBM has emerged as a   key partner of ServiceNow, reselling its service management and   other tools. Accenture has been a marketing partner in the   government market.Alex Zukin, an analyst at Piper Jaffray, says IBM looms as a   ""logical acquirer (of ServiceNow) over the longer term.""""ServiceNow's platform would be a logical extension of IBM's   cloud infrastructure,"" Zukin said.Possible Buyout?In mid-2016, ServiceNow was among companies listed in a score   card of possible Salesforce.com acquisitions that leaked from a   board of directors meeting.Pegasystems(PEGA) andTableau Software(DATA) also were on Salesforce's wish list, but ServiceNow's   market cap is much bigger at more than $15 billion.ServiceNow generates hefty free cash flow, a feat that's not   common among SaaS companies, and a plus for any potential   acquirers. Free cash flow rose 40% to $322 million in   2016.The company reported unadjusted earnings of 71 cents in 2016   but it's still not profitable on an adjusted basis, which   includes stock-based compensation. Shares of ServiceNow   ended trading Friday up 1% to 92.74.ServiceNow has forecast 2017 revenue growth of 32% to $1.835   billion, at the midpoint of its guidance. Billing growth has   stabilized after slowing in 2015, when the company reorganized   sales. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters are modeling 54%   earnings growth to $1.08 a share in 2017.A roadmap to ServiceNow's $4 billion revenue goal was revealed   in May 2016. A month earlier, it settled patent infringement   cases with BMC and HPE. Analysts expect ServiceNow to   continue taking share in the service management market from   BMC and others, though privately held Cherwell Software is a   strong rival.As ServiceNow expands into new markets, analysts say it could   run into more competition from the likes ofAtlassian(TEAM),Zendesk(ZEN) andSplunk(SPLK).Zukin says that in many cases ServiceNow's management software   can work alongside other tools. He says human resources, whereWorkday(WDAY) is a leading provider, is one example.Growing RivalryThe Salesforce rivalry, though, seems to be growing.""Historically, ServiceNow's messaging has been that ServiceNow   and Salesforce.com can coexist in accounts. The new message seems   to be that customers are increasingly taking a 'CRM model' or   'service management' platform approach,"" Brian Schwartz, an   Oppenheimer analyst, wrote in a recent report to clients. ""In   other words, we believe the two platforms will increasingly be   seen as future alternatives rather than running in parallel.""ServiceNow aims to leverage its database technology to provide   more problem-solving tools in handling customer-service issues.   Both Salesforce.com and ServiceNow are adding artificial   intelligence to software. By embedding data analytics and   ""machine learning"" into software, they aim to make it easier for   customers to automate tasks.ServiceNow acquired AI startup DxContinuum in January.   Slootman says he plans to utilize DxContinuum's  throughout   ServiceNow's cloud platform. The tools will help customers build   predictive models that make it easier to categorize incoming   requests from company employees.Aside from HR, customer service and security, Slootman says   SeriveNow could target other areas.""The good thing about this model is we can try things, we can   be opportunistic,"" Slootman said. ""If something works, we'll do   more. But we can also back out if it doesn't. There are no   life-and-death bets. We can be very agile in how we move in or   out of adjacent markets.""RELATED:Will Microsoft Stymie Salesforce.com's Stock     Turnaround?"

Why Connected Cars Are a Big Deal for Microsoft Corporation's Cloud Business;2/16/2017;"Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) is making a big move in the automotive space   without making any cars of its own. The Redmond, Wash. company   has decided that it won't be joining the race to develop its own   cars, like many of its peers. Instead, Microsoft wants to become   the racetrack itself.Microsoft's automotive moveAt CES 2017, Microsoft announced the launch of the Connected   Vehicle Platform based on Azure in a bid to become the   cornerstone of the connected and automated car revolution. This   platform will focus on five key things the cars of tomorrow need   -- advanced navigation, predictive maintenance, better in-car   productivity, customer inputs, and finally, enabling autonomous   driving.Image source: Microsoft.makeArticleAd();According to a blog post by Microsoft Executive VP of   Business Development Peggy Johnson:Microsoft's cloud will do the heavy lifting by ingesting     huge volumes of sensor and usage data from connected vehicles,     and then helping automakers apply that data in powerful     ways.Microsoft, therefore, is taking the smart approach of becoming   the enabler of connected and automated cars. Such an approach   avoids the need for delivering any sort of packaged product to   automakers. The connected vehicle platform will use artificial   intelligence (AI) based on data provided by vehicles and drivers   in real time.In fact, the company has been shoring up its AI capabilities   in order to develop its automotive platform. Last month, it   announced the acquisition of Canadian AI company Maluuba for an   undisclosed amount. Maluuba uses deep learning and neural   networks to create independent machines that can ""think, reason,   and communicate like humans."" Microsoft can use these traits to   enhance the data processing and decision-making capabilities of   its own technology.Additionally, Microsoft will power the in-car productivity of   cars by equipping automakers with its key products, such as   Office 365, Cortana, and Skype for Business. This focus on   offering a cloud platform with advanced computing and   productivity to automotive clients should help it win a lot of   business in this space.The opportunity in automotive data processing and     storageComputer software provider Tuxera believes a new car in 2017   will generate 20 GB of data daily if it is driven for just two   hours. This amount of data will come from just 16 sensors and two   cameras, and these cars are far from being fully autonomous. By   comparison, future cars with enhanced self-driving capabilities   are expected to have at least 20 computers on board to process   the data captured by cameras.In fact, an autonomous vehicle is expected to generate 10 GB   of data each second, which will increase as more sensors are   added. This presents the need for a centralized   infrastructure to share the processing workload. This way, the   vehicle can collect data and prioritize actions that have to be   executed in real time and upload the rest to a data center for   further processing and analysis.Microsoft wants to become this data center with its connected   vehicle platform. The company has even equipped the Azure cloud   platform withNVIDIA's Quadro professional graphics card. As a result, Azure can now   offer supercomputing-class performance to its customers for   high-performance applications, indicating that it is prepared to   process the huge amount of data connected cars will generate.What connected cars mean for Microsoft's     businessMicrosoft is on the right track as it has already won   contracts with key automakers. TheRenault-Nissanalliance is one of the first adopters of the connected vehicle   platform as it plans to put 10 autonomous cars on the roads by   2020 using Microsoft's cloud.Investors should also note that car makers aren't the only   ones utilizing the Azure connected cloud platform. Reinsurance   provider Swiss Re, for example, is exploring the use of the Azure   cloud to collect and analyze telematics data to create specific   insurance packages for customers based on driving   behavior. Similarly, geographical information system   provider Esri has also signed up to use the Azure cloud to   provide analytics and data to the driver of a car.A growing, diversified client base can boost the company's   cloud business in the long run, which is already growing at a   faster-than-expected pace. When Microsoft released its second   quarter results, its cloud revenue grew 10% year over year to   $6.9 billion, outperforming analyst expectations.The company's cloud growth was driven by a 93% jump in revenue   from Azure as Microsoft saw the platform's usage by clients   double on a year-over-year basis. An increase in the adoption of   Microsoft's connected vehicle services over time will lead to   wins for the Azure platform as data needs inevitably grow.10 stocks we like better than MicrosoftWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Fidelity Investments' Revenue And Profit Rose In 2016;2/16/2017;"Known for managing millions of retirement accounts, college   savings plans and regular taxable-investment accounts, Fidelity   Investments on Thursday said 2016 revenue rose 3.4% to $15.9   billion, a record for the privately held company.The combination of revenue growth and slightly lower expenses   produced a record profit of $3.5 billion. That was an increase of   19.5% over 2015's $3 billion in operating income.""All businesses contributed to our strong results,"" a Fidelity   spokesman said.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');The 2016 profit increase reversed a profit decline in   2015, when profit fell $325 million, or 9.8%, from 2014's $3.282   billion.""Fidelity is profitable, strong, innovative and driven to   growth,"" said Jim Lowell, editor-in-chief of Fidelity   Investor, an independent newsletter. ""That's not true for many   financial services companies.""The 2015 profit erosion was caused by spending on staffing and   technology to compete with tough rivals.Operating expenses fell slightly to $12.35 billion in 2016   from $12.4 billion the year before.""The slowdown in expenses is because Fidelity is starting to   see the benefit in Abigail's (Johnson) leadership,"" Lowell said.   One way she has cut spending is by centralizing functions,   eliminating redundancies in information technology and   compliance. ""There's more efficiency,"" Lowell said.Across all of its stock mutual funds, technology was   Fidelity's largest sector as of Jan. 31 with a 20.3%, according   to Morningstar Inc.Fidelity's top U.S. holdings wereApple(AAPL),Facebook(FB),Amazon(AMZN),Alphabet(GOOGL) andMicrosoft(MSFT).Apple's stock has surged 22% since shortly after the election.   It has a so-so 76 Composite Rating from IBD. Facebook has a 90   Comp Rating and is trading near its all-time high after breaking   out of a cup-with-handle base in late January. Amazon has risen   12% this year, has a 76 Comp Rating, and has formed a   cup-with-handle base with a buy point of 843.94. Alphabet's Comp   Rating is 69. Microsoft has a weak 60 Comp Rating. It has   uptrended since June.99 is the highest possible Comp Rating, which is on a scale   from 1-99.Fidelity also reported a record $5.7 trillion in investor   assets under administration (AUA), up 10.6% from year-end   2015.Total discretionary and nondiscretionary asset flow for the   year was $218.9 billion, up 15% from 2015 flow.Discretionary flow includes flow to and from managed accounts,   mutual funds, exchange traded funds and collective investment   trusts.Nondiscretionary flow goes to and from investments not managed   by Fidelity, such as other firms' mutual funds and individual   securities.At year-end, Fidelity serviced 27.5 million members of   workplace retirement plans. It serviced another 8.9 million   retail households, plus 8.7 million institutional accounts.Those totals were 6%, 6.8% and 4.1% higher, respectively, than   at year-end 2015.Fidelity mutual fund managers found it harder to beat their   peers in 2016. Fidelity mutual funds beat 58%, 68% and 70% of   their peers for the trailing one-, three- and five-year periods   that ended Dec. 31. They outperformed 72% of their peers in   the one- and three-year periods and 71% of their peers in   the five-year span.Still, the outperformance rate was high. ""To beat 58% of your   peers and have that as a bad year - most fund companies   would kill for that number,"" said newsletter editor   Lowell. ""The falloff reflects the difficult time active   managers had during the six-week Trump (inspired) market run-up.   Odds are they'll be back to outperforming 70% or more in 2017.   That is excellent.""The annual report is a must-read mainly for Fidelity   employees, who control 51% of the voting stock, while the Johnson   family controls the other 49%.Abigail Johnson is chairwoman of parent company   FMR. She succeeded her father, ""Ned"" Edward C. Johnson III, late   last year, shortly before her 55th birthday. Ned Johnson had been   chairman since 1977.Fidelity was founded by Abigail's grandfather, Edward C.   Johnson II, in 1946. His father, Samuel Johnson, worked in the   family dry goods business at the C.F. Hovey department store.Abigail's brother, 52-year-old Edward C. Johnson IV, is   president of Fidelity's Pembroke Real Estate division.Going forward, a key challenge for Fidelity is persuading   customers - especially mutual fund investors - of the   value of active management. ""Broad indices are holding fair or   fully valued stocks (after the long market run-up),"" Lowell said.   ""Active managers can look at which stocks have the best cash   flow, best defensive characteristics, best growth opportunities,   rather than buying bundles of high-priced stocks passively.""Behind The 2016 ImprovementFormally, the annual report is for Fidelity Financial   Services, which consists of Fidelity Investments and the other   financial services lines of parent company FMR. It excludes FMR's   nonfinancial businesses such as its hotel and real estate   operations.Fidelity has lagged rival Vanguard in attracting net new money   from shareholders.In 2016, Fidelity saw the second-largest net outflow from   mutual funds, as shareholders hit the firm with $24.5 billion in   net redemptions, according to Morningstar Inc. That left Fidelity   with $1.2 trillion in mutual fund total net assets. That asset   count reflects open-end mutual funds and excludes money market   funds and funds of funds.Fidelity's mutual fund outflow was exceeded only by Franklin   Templeton Investments' $43.2 billion in net outflow. Franklin   Templeton had $378.7 billion in total net assets.Net inflow to passively run Fidelity funds - mainly exchange   traded funds - reduced its combined mutual-fund-and-ETF net   outflow by about $1 billion.Whether it was flow just to mutual funds or to funds plus   ETFs, shareholders largely had low costs on their minds. That   made index mutual funds and ETFs popular destinations for net   inflow. ""By far, 2016 belonged to Vanguard,"" Morningstar editor   Tom Lauricella and senior analyst Alina Lamy noted in a recent   report. ""The low-cost juggernaut dominated the flows landscape to   a remarkable degree.""Vanguard drew net inflow to its mutual funds that vastly   outpaced its rival firms'. Vanguard lured in a net $182.997   billion to its mutual funds.All other mutual fund complexes with inflow - there were 314   if them - had combined net inflow of $151 billion.Vanguard also attracted $94.26 billion in net inflow to its   ETFs.Still, Fidelity had bright spots. Investors poured $37.2   billion in net inflow into passively run Fidelity mutual funds   and ETFs. The trouble was that investors yanked a net $60.5   billion from Fidelity's actively run funds and ETFs.And three Fidelity portfolios were among the 12 top stock   mutual funds of 2016 in terms of gathering net inflow. Now-$111.4   billion Fidelity 500 Index Fund (FUSEX) pulled in a net $7.3   billion, fourth best. Sixth best was now-$5 billion Fidelity SAI   U.S. Large Cap Index (FLCPX), which drew in a net $4.4 billion.   And 11th best was now-$4.3 billion Fidelity SAI U.S. Quality   Index (FUQIX), which attracted a net $3.2 billion.Money Market FundsIn addition, a trio of Fidelity money market funds had massive   net inflow, which are not reflected in the Morningstar flow data   for long-term funds.Fidelity Institutional Government (FIGXX) pulled in $74.8   billion in net inflow. Fidelity Government Money Market Fund   (SPAXX) drew a net $37.7 billion. And Fidelity Government Cash   Reserves (FDRXX) pulled in a net $21.3 billion.Industrywide, money market fund inflowwas driven by investor uncertainty. Investors are unsure how markets will respond to President   Trump's policies, actions by the new Congress, the strong dollar,   expected additional interest-rate hikes by the Federal Reserve   and global political events, Tom Roseen, head of research   services for Lipper, told IBD.Another reason for volatile flow into and in some cases out   from money market funds is the new Securities and Exchange   Commission rule requiring certain money market funds to impose   redemption fees and limits to discourage shareholder exits in   time of market stress, Roseen says.The funds with net inflow hold government-issued debt.   Referred to as government money market funds, funds in that group   are generally exempt from the gates-and-fees requirement. In   turn, that makes them popular with investors who do not want   their ability to exit the fund to be limited or subject to   penalty fees.RELATED:Are Fidelity's Recent Stock Buys And Sells     Retirement Account Hot Sauce?Vanguard Net Fund Inflow Dwarfed Its Peers' In     2016Vanguard Drew The Lion's Share Of 2016's Mutual     Fund Net Inflow"

Would You Ditch Your Home Phone for Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN)?;2/16/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsRoughly half of American homes no longer have an old-school telephone, relying instead on cell phones and smartphones. IfAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) andAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL) have their way, home phones could become even more of a rarity.makeArticleAd();Source: AmazonA report inTheWall Street Journalsuggests the companies are working on adding voice-calling capabilities to the Amazon Echo and Google Home smart speakers.The Plan to Make Amazon Echo Your New TelephoneTheWall Street Journalis reporting that Google and Amazon are looking at an all-new use for their smart speakers:replacing the home telephone.The idea makes sense. Telephones increasingly seem like outdated technology. Between smartphones and PC-based calling services likeMicrosoft Corporation's(NASDAQ:MSFT) Skype, the days of the dedicated home phone seem numbered. In 2015, a survey by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (which, apparently, cares about these things) found thatnearly half of American homes had given up their dedicated landline.But, that still leaves a lot of telephones in operation.Apparently, it's occurred to both Amazon and Google that smart speakers such as the Amazon Echo and Google Home may be the right device in the right place at the right time. Smart speakers get the name because they leverage an AI-powered personal digital assistant.Why Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock Could Fly to $1,000 in 2017Amazon's Echo is home to Alexa, withover 5,000 skills. These devices have the smarts to take on telephone functionality. They could incorporate Skype, for example. And, Google has a slew of its own telephony applications it could leverage, including Google Voice and Duo.The Amazon Echo and Google Home are equipped with excellent microphones, they have speakers, they are always connected (to the internet) and they respond instantly to voice commands, even from across a room.So, as long as privacy isn't an issue (since using one would be like using a speakerphone), a smart speaker could replace a telephoneandsave consumers money by eliminating the monthly cost of a landline. While this would be a potentially useful trick for existing smart speaker owners, it's the kind of practical capability that could drive sales among those consumers who wouldn't otherwise consider a high-tech device like the Amazon Echo.The Challenges of Turning a Smart Speaker Into a TelephoneWhile the technology and built-in smarts may be there, in reality turning that Amazon Echo on your kitchen counter into your home phone may not be quite that simple.TheWall Street Journalarticle lays out some of the challenges. For example, there are potential privacy issues, not only in speaking out loud to the Echo (it lacks an AUX input, so you couldn't physically connect a handset), but the fact that now your telephone would always be listening to you and recording key data like phone numbers and call durations.Amazon and Google would also have to implement a feature to prevent voice commands from being triggered during a phone conversation.It's also been pointed out that switching from a cell phone or landline to an internet-based telephone service has implications for emergency services. For example, theFCC lists a series of limitations to 911 servicewhen home owners rely on internet-based (or VoIP) services.Calls may not be routed directly to an emergency center, locational information may not be available to emergency responders and, in a power outage, internet telephones go offline without battery backups.7 Tech Stocks That Could Implode at Any MinuteDespite the challenges,The Wall Street Journalsays its sources are convinced Amazon and Google will move forward, calling the move to telephone capability ""the logical next step for the artificial intelligence-powered speakers."" And, that move could happen later this year.The question is, knowing that there are some privacy concerns and potential safety issues in doing so, would you ditch your landline and use an Amazon Echo as your home's new telephone?As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace7 Stocks to Sell or Short Before the Bears StrikeBank of America Corp (BAC) Stock Is Going to $30 This Year7 Stocks Warren Buffett Is Buying or SellingThe postWould You Ditch Your Home Phone for Amazon.com, Inc.

Apple Inc. (AAPL) Careens Closer to Major AR Announcement;2/16/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) CEO Tim Cook has been talking an awful lot lately about augmented reality - or AR. The latest episode was last week, when hecompared the technology to the iPhonein terms of its potential to be big.makeArticleAd();Source: NanticAfter months of repeatedly playing up AR in public, it's beginning to feel as if Cook is setting the expectations of the press and public about the technology.That begs the question: Is Apple Inc. planning a major augmented reality announcement?AR vs. VR: What's the Difference?Augmented reality is related to virtual reality - or VR - but the two are also very different.Virtual reality uses technology to completely immerse people in a virtual world. This requires powerful computing hardware and special headgear. VR has spent several years as the next big thing, culminating withFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) buying VR pioneer Oculus for $2 billion in 2014.Virtual reality hasn't quite caught on in a big way - the expensive and awkward equipment is a big hurdle to overcome - but gamers have begun embracing it.7 Stocks Warren Buffett Is Buying or SellingSo far, Apple has shown no interest in virtual reality and Tim Cook has actually made a point in several interviews of downplaying VR. In the latest, when Cook spoke toThe Independent, he laments the fact that virtual reality""closes the world out.""""Most people don't want to lock themselves out from the world for a long period of time and today you can't do that because you get sick from it.""The antisocial aspects of virtual reality, the equipment requirements and side effects such as motion sickness have been common themes in Cook's argument against virtual reality.However, he is very excited by augmented reality and its ability to go mainstream. Instead of locking a person into a virtual world, AR overlays the existing world with additional information. One of the most popular examples of AR in action is the gamePokemon Go, released last summer. That game was themost downloaded app of 2016on Apple Inc.'s App Store.Is Apple Inc. Planning a Major AR Announcement?Tim Cook's views on augmented reality seem to have been getting more positive in the past few months, reaching the point where he's actively hyping the technology.In October, he said:""I do think that a significant portion of the population of developed countries, and eventually all countries, will have AR experiences every day, almost like eating three meals a day. It will become that much a part of you.""And last week, he toldThe Independent:""I regard it as a big idea like the smartphone. The smartphone is for everyone, we don't have to think the iPhone is about a certain demographic, or country or vertical market: it's for everyone. I think AR is that big, it's huge.""What's holding AR back is the technology.Hardware doesn't need to be as powerful as the silicon needed to drive virtual reality gear. And rather than a fully enclosed headpiece or goggles - that themselves are so complex they can cost $600 on top of the PC needed to drive them - augmented reality can be delivered through specialized eyeglasses or on a smartphone's display. The problem is current efforts haven't been quite good enough.Alphabet Inc's(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) failed Google Glass is the best-known example of the AR overlay glasses model, whilePokemon Goshows the relatively primitive AR experience that current smartphones can deliver.What if Tim Cook has been playing up augmented reality (and dissing VR) because Apple Inc. is preparing to make a major push into AR? It could be the company that takes augmented reality mainstream by nailing the hardware, while everyone else is distracted by trying to get consumers to buy into VR.There has been speculation that Apple is working with German optics firmCarl Zeiss AGonApple-branded AR glasses. The iPhone 8 could also incorporate next generation hardware - from cameras to CPU and GPU - that are optimized to make AR a killer feature.Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock Could Win Big With 'Windows Cloud'We'll have to wait until the company is ready to show its hand to know exactly what is up. But based on Tim Cook's continued promotion of the technology, it seems likely that Apple Inc. is priming us for AR-related announcement.And if Cook is even close to being right about augmented reality having the potential to be as big as the iPhone, the upside for Apple stock could be huge.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace7 Stocks to Sell or Short Before the Bears Strike3 Tire Stocks That Are Burning Rubber in ChinaThe postApple Inc.

QuoteSegment Revenue DetailsOn a year-over-year basis, products (73.3% of total revenue) were down 5.5% to $8.49 billion, while services (26.7%) increased 4.9% to $3.09 billion.Under the Product category, Collaboration, Wireless, Security and Other increased 4%, 3%, 14%, and 53%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis. However, this increase was partially offset by weak performance from Switching, NGN Routing, Data Center and Service Provider Video segments which decreased 5%, 10%, 4% and 41%, respectively.Geographically, on a year-over-year basis, revenues from the Americas, EMEA and APJC declined 4%, 1% and 4%, respectively. Total emerging markets declined 7% while the BRICs plus Mexico went down by 5%.In terms of customer segments enterprise inched up 1%, commercial grew 3%, public sector declined 6% and service provider dipped 1%.Operating DetailsNon-GAAP gross margin expanded 30 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter to 63.6% in the reported quarter. The expansion was primarily driven by higher service gross margin (up 210 bps).Operating expenses as percentage of revenues increased 40 bps to 35.6% primarily owing to increase in most of the expense line items. As percentage of revenues, Research and development (R&D) and General and Administrative (G&A) expenses increased 30 bps and 240 bps, respectively. However, Sales and Marketing (S&M) expense remained flat on a year-over-year basis.As a result, operating margin (including stock-based compensation) contracted 20 bps to 28%.Cisco Systems Inc. - Earnings Surprise |     FindTheBestBalance Sheet and Cash FlowCisco exited the second quarter with cash and investments balance of almost $71.8 billion compared with $71 billion in the prior quarter. Cash & cash equivalents and investments available in the U.S. at the end of quarter were $9.6 billion.Total debt (short term and long term) was $34.9 billion, slightly up from $34.8 billion at the end of previous quarter.Cisco raised quarterly dividend by 3 cents to 29 cents per share, to be paid on Apr 26, 2017. The company repurchased approximately 33 million shares of common stock under its stock repurchase program at an average price of $30.33 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $1.0 billion.As of Jan 28, 2017, Cisco had repurchased 4.7 billion shares for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $98.6 billion since the inception of the stock repurchase program. The remaining authorized amount under this program is approximately $13.4 billion.GuidanceFor third-quarter fiscal 2017, revenues are expected to decline in the range of 2% or remain flat on a year-over-year basis. Non-GAAP earnings are anticipated to be in the range 57-59 cents per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was pegged at 53 cents on revenue estimates of $11.87 billion.Gross margin is expected to be in the range of 63-64%, while operating margin is anticipated between 29% and 30% for the quarter.Our TakeWe believe that Cisco's expanding footprint in the rapidly growing security and data center market are promising. The company's security solutions continue to add customers, which is positive in our view.Although the transition from blade to rack server continues to hurt Data Center revenues, the collaboration with Microsoft'sMSFTAzure is expected to drive growth going ahead. Further, the acquisition of AppDynamics is also positive in our view.Additionally, the company's partnerships with the likes of salesforce.comCRMand International Business MachinesIBMwill help it to gain significant traction in the cloud and Internet of Things (IoT) market space in the long run.Moreover, continued share buyback and dividend hikes are positive in our view.We note that Cisco has outperformed the ZacksComputer Networksindustry in the last one year. While the stock gained 24.0%, the industry witnessed an increase of 23.2%. We expect the aforesaid factors to drive upside going forward.However, the modest second-quarter results reflected intensifying competition from several smaller players in the networking segments, slowing order growth from service providers and challenges in the emerging markets. We believe that third-quarter revenue guidance continues to reflect these growing headwinds.Zacks Rank & Key PicksCisco currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Buy).You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank   stocks here.Just Released - Driverless Cars: Your Roadmap to   Mega-Profits TodayIn this latest Special Report, Zacks' Aggressive Growth Strategist Brian Bolan explores a full-blown technological breakthrough in the making - autonomous cars.

3 Things for GameStop Investors to Watch in 2017;2/16/2017;"Image source: GameStop.GameStop(NYSE: GME) stock had a rough year in 2016, with its share price   falling roughly 11%, and same-store sales down between 10% and   12%. While the company faces challenges as a result of the   transition of software sales from retail channels to digital   distribution, the tough outlook and lagging sales have brought   its forward earnings multiple to roughly 7 and pushed its   dividend yield to 5.8%, and a beaten-down valuation suggests the   stock could bounce back this year if certain favorable trends   develop.makeArticleAd();Click through the presentation below for information on why   collectibles and key product releases from companies includingNintendo(NASDAQOTH: NTDOY) ,Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) , andActivision Blizzard(NASDAQ: ATVI)  are key points for GameStop investors to   watch this year.10 stocks we like better than MicrosoftWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

The Technology Sector Won’t Give Up Its Dominance;2/16/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsEDITOR'S NOTE: Sam Collins will return on Feb. 21.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');The markets continued their relentless march upward on Wednesday. TheS&P 500finished 0.5% higher, theDow Jones Industrial Averagewas a touch better at 0.52%, theRussell 2000index of small-cap stocks finished ahead by 0.54% and theNasdaq Compositeled the way, up 0.64%.In the aftermath of the presidential election in November 2016, the information technology (IT) sector - a sector that had been flying high during the latter half of 2016 - stumbled. As traders scrambled to move money into the financial, basic materials and industrial sectors to take advantage of President Donald Trump's promised tax cuts, regulatory reforms and infrastructure spending, they pulled money out of IT stocks, thinking their bullish run was over.How wrong they were!After the sector's temporary stumble in mid-November, IT stocks - such asApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL),Microsoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) andFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) - regained their footing and have been driving the market higher ever since, as you can see in theTechnology Select Sector SPDR ETF(NYSEARCA:XLK).Fig. 1 - Daily Chart of the Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLK)The IT sector owes its current success to three primary factors: strong earnings growth, a bullish outlook and a stabilizing global economy.7 Stocks Warren Buffett Is Buying or SellingStrong earnings growth has dominated the narrative surrounding the IT sector this earnings season. According to FactSet, the IT sector leads the way in earnings numbers that came in above the consensus estimate in the fourth quarter of 2016, with a whopping 87% of companies beating expectations (see Fig. 2).Fig. 2 - S&P 500 Earnings Above, In-Line, Below Estimates: Q4 2016The companies in the IT sector then kept the bullish ball rolling by providing more positive guidance for the future than any other sector, with 48% of companies issuing positive guidance (see Fig. 3).Fig. 3 - Percentage of S&P 500 Companies with Q1 Positive & Negative GuidanceOne of the reasons for this positive guidance is the bullish recovery not only of the U.S. economy but also of the global economy in general. The European Union (EU) upgraded itsWinter 2017 Economic Forecastfor the region on Monday, China reported stronger-than-expected gross domestic product (GDP) numbers last month and emerging-market economies are starting to thrive once more as commodity prices rebound.This global recovery is especially poignant for the IT sector, as it derives a larger percentage of its revenue from international sources than any other sector (see Fig. 4).Fig. 4 - S&P 500: Aggregate Sector Geographic Revenue Exposure (%)As the U.S. stock market continues to press on to all-time high after all-time high, look for the IT sector to remain a driving force as companies become increasingly reliant on their technology infrastructure and consumers continue their shift to a mobile, interconnected world.Today's Trading LandscapeTo see a list of the companies reporting earnings today,click here.For a list of this week's economic reports due out,click here.Tell us what you think about this article!

Tech Stock Roundup: INTC Analyst Day, AAPL Smartphone Lead;2/15/2017;"Intel Analyst DayIntel's analyst day was mostly about the growing importance of the data center business as a driver of both revenue growth and margin pressure. Within data center, the enterprise and government segment is expected to be the weakest due to delays related to the transition from on-premises to public cloud-based deployment, which is why it will grow a mere 2%.But this will be strongly supplemented with 15%+ growth in cloud service provider (helped by TAM expansion and higher prices) and 10%+ growth in communications service provider revenues. The much larger CPU portion will post a 6% CAGR dropping from 87% of revenue in 2017 to 75% in 2021. Non CPU parts of the data center business will record a 30% CAGR during the same time period.Intel put out some rather convincing charts showing the artificial intelligence opportunity and Intel's position within it along with its significance for total server revenue. Accordingly, in 2016, AI was just 7% of revenue, of which 60% was classic machine learning with the remainder being deep learning.In 2010, when NVIDIANVDAentered the market, Intel HPC accounted for 93% of the market with NVIDIA making up the rest. NVIDIA grew strongly for the next two years but Xeon Phi has started taking back share again. As a result, in 2016, Intel's combined technologies gained back some market to end at 84%.Because of the huge opportunity, Intel will be devoting more R&D dollars to strengthen this business and its new chips starting from the last iteration of 10nm will be first available to its data center customers. Increasing costs will therefore have a negative impact on this business over the next few years.In 2017, management expects revenue growth in the low single digit range, a gross margin of around 63% and EPS of around $2.80. DCG will be up high single digits, CCG will be down mid single-digits, NSG up 20%+, IoTG up 10%+ and PSG up mid-single-digits.Intel expects to spend $12 billion (+/- $500 million) on capex this year, of which $2.5 billion will be on memory. But capacity additions will account for most of the rest.Management also pointed to future opportunities: memory ($100 billion TAM), autonomous vehicles in 2025 ($10 billion TAM) and 5G connected devices (more than $50 billion TAM).Intel's U.S. Factory Endears It to TrumpIntel CEO Brian Krzanich met with Trump and promised to invest an additional $7 billion in an Arizona factory it originally started building back in 2011. The plant will employ 3K high-tech high-wage employees and it is estimated that indirect jobs relating to it will take employment up by about 10K.Intel has struggled to take the x86 architecture below 10nm, which could be partially responsible for construction being put on hold. Intel is one of the few technology companies that stuck with its U.S. fabs as a matter of policy even when many of its peers moved offshore. Intel owns leading edge IP that it wouldn't want to outsource to places where IP laws are suspect.The CEO made no bones about the fact that conducive tax and regulatory measures had prompted the company's decision to complete the investment now, so he may have eked out some concessions from Trump.Apple Sells More Smartphones Than SamsungAccording to IDC data published Feb 1, Apple shipped slightly more smartphones in the holiday quarter than Samsung, despite the fact that iPhone shipments were down for the first time in 2016. This is the first time in five years that the company gained the top spot.Apple's success was attributed to the iPhone 7 and Samsung's Galaxy Note 7 fiasco. Samsung said the exploding phones cost it $3 billion in sales. Overall smartphones grew just 2.3% in 2016 compared to 10.4% the previous year. Apple's 4.7% growth rate was better than the industry. Samsung shipments declined 5.2%.IDC expects the market to rebound this year, in part because of expectations of a landmark phone from Apple and renewed demand in the Middle East and Latin America, which didn't have a good 2016. Separately, Canaccord Genuity has said that while Apple accounted for just 18% of the smartphone market last quarter, it took 92% of the profits.Google Selling Its Satellite CompanyGoogle has agreed to sell its high-resolution satellite imaging business, Terra Bella, to imaging startup Planet Labs for somewhere between $300 and $500 million. Planet Labs has a number of medium resolution satellites that will complement the ones it has acquired, according to Planet.Google is not quitting the mapping business and a long-term agreement to license the technology back from Planet is reportedly a part of the deal. This may not be a hugely profitable deal for Google given that it originally acquired Terra Bella for $500 million in 2014 when the company was called Skybox. But it may be a part of the realignment of its business units and goals under CFO Ruth Porat.CompanyLast WeekLast  6 MonthsAAPL+2.36%+22.12%FB+2.45%+7.12%GOOGL+1.79%+3.68%MSFT+0.50%+10.23%INTC-3.23%+0.86%CSCO+0.61%+1.61%AMZN+2.12%+7.94%Other stories you might have missed-CorporateApple Submits on Aussie Bank Boycott: Apple has submitted a statement to the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission (ACCC) charging the top four banks (Commonwealth Bank of Australia, National Australia Bank Ltd., Westpac Banking Corp. and Bendigo & Adelaide Bank Ltd) in Australia of delaying the expansion of Apple Pay, which could prove detrimental to smaller card issuers while reducing options for consumers.The banks, which are in the process of developing their own mobile technology, are seeking to bargain collectively with Apple to have their apps included in Apple Pay. Apple would rather have card issuers add their cards to its wallet and have the banks pay for inclusion. Apple said it won't give the banks a ""free ride"" while the banks responded saying Apple's assertion was ""incorrect and unsupported."" In its draft ruling, the ACCC denied the banks' request. The final ruling is expected in March.Apple Hires Away Amazon Executive: Timothy D. Twerdahl, who formerly headed Amazon's Fire TV unit as its general manager and director, has now joined Apple as its VP in charge of marketing Apple TV. Pete Distad who previously played that role will now help Apple negotiate content deals. Twerdahl has vast experience in streaming: before his four-year stint at Amazon he was VP of consumer devices at Roku and before that, he was an executive at Netflix. The executive changes seem to indicate that Apple is finally going to make some bold moves in this business, which hasn't really done that well versus competitors.Facebook VR Demo Stations Shutting Down: Facebook (FB) is closing down around 200 of its 500 VR demo stations at Best Buy stores. It appears that the Oculus wasn't as much of a success as anticipated because few people came in for a demo at all and store attendants said that frequent software issues with the headsets made them unsellable. But the headsets aren't going out of circulation. The stores will continue to sell them and Facebook has promised that there will be pop up and other stores that will continue with the demos. The program started with 50 stores that were later expanded to 500 in August last year.Facebook Hires MTV Executive: Facebook is very serious about content, video content in particular. On the earnings call, Zuckerberg mentioned how video was the next big thing just like mobile. So it has done everything possible to help share videos of every description and host Facebook Live streams. But in order to increase differentiation and the price of ads running adjacent to these videos,Facebook needs a little bit more. And now it's apparent that that is original content. The company has snapped up Mina Lefevre, who was in charge of scripted programming at MTV to head up its content development efforts. She will report to Ricky Van Veen, co-founder of CollegeHumor.Legal/RegulatoryMicrosoft Battles with Govt Spying: The court hasn't allowed the government's request to throw out a MicrosoftMSFTlawsuit, in which it contended that the Electronic Communications Privacy Act violates the first amendment. The act allows the government to issue gag orders when asking for data housed on third-party servers like those owned by Microsoft.The Justice Department had asked the government to dismiss the lawsuit saying that it needed to keep investigations confidential so as not to alarm possible wrong-doers and that they did eventually get to know when charges were filed. Microsoft succeeded in convincing the judge that this affected its ability to do business. But the court held that Microsoft couldn't assert constitutional rights for someone else, so it couldn't talk on behalf of its customers.Google Wants Warrants for Govt Snooping: Google's head of information security Richard Salgado visited senators to speed up the passage of a bill that has previously been endorsed by the House of Representatives. The bill seeks to do away with one clause of the current law that allows the government to obtain access emails that are more than 180 days old without a warrant. Google would like the law to be applicable for all emails irrespective of age. The bill was in the hands of Senator Jeff Sessions prior to the elections, when he was elevated to the position of Attorney General by President Trump.New Technology/ProductsCisco Announces First SIG: CiscoCSCOhas created a new Secure Internet Gateway (SIG) in the cloud that will allow on-field or mobile enterprise users to connect securely to the Internet even when they aren't connected through VPN. Cisco's solution is called Umbrella. Umbrella can identify which SaaS apps are being used and enforce policies to block risky or inappropriate apps; analyze over 100 billion internet requests every day, correlating with over 11 billion historical events to identify patterns, detect anomalies, and create models to automatically uncover attacker infrastructure being staged for the next threat; and other security checks through machine learning, Cisco Talos threat intelligence, and Cisco Advanced Malware Protection (AMP).Microsoft Extends Support to Cloud Customers: Boston Consulting Group says that while IP lawsuits have increased 22% over the last five years, patent trolls - companies that don't have a business but acquire patents to benefit from litigation - increased patent acquisitions by 35%. It is perhaps these trends that prompted Microsoft to expand its patent protection coverage to all users of its Azure infrastructure. Microsoft will give customers one of its own patents to help them deal with the litigation. Microsoft also expanded its indemnification program under which it provides funds or legal counsel to help customers defend themselves.M&A and CollaborationsNES and Google Have a Deal: Nashville Electric Service has withdrawn its lawsuit against the Metro Council and telecom companies filed last October, after Google promised to indemnify it against liabilities that may arise out of Metro's One Touch Make Ready policy. The current law requires that when a new provider's line is added to a utility pole, each existing provider is required to move its line, resulting in needless delay and disruption on the sidewalk.The new policy allows one person to move the poles, thus making the process more efficient. Existing providers like AT&T and Comcast object to the law on the grounds that Metro is not authorized to make the law, which is a matter for the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The deal is significant because NES owns 80% of the utility poles in Nashville and Google is likely to succeed because the action promotes competition in the market and can force incumbents to match Google Fiber's high-speed services.Some NumbersMicrosoft Azure Price Cuts: Microsoft has taken the lead in announcing price cuts for its Azure Virtual Machines. The company said that compute-optimized F Series instances would cost its customers up to 24% less, while A1 Basic instances would drop by up to 61%. Azure HotBlock Blob Storage and Cool Block Blob Storage costs are also down.

Attunity Ltd. - Big Data Enabler With 84% Upside;2/15/2017;"ByCobiaman:Share Price - $8.00Market Cap - $140 millionEnterprise Value - $131 million2016 Revenue - $54.5 million2017E Revenue - $66.9 million (23% growth)2018E Revenue - $82.5 million (23% growth)EV/2016 Revenue - 2.4xEV/2017E Revenue - 1.9xEV/2018E Revenue - 1.6xAttunity Ltd. (ATTU) provides software to enterprises used to replicate and integrate heterogeneous data sources into a single data lake, which provides the basis for creating data warehouses used for Big Data analysis. The company has been in existence for 20 years, first providing software used to integrate mainframe data and then adding more data sources as they became available in the market. Current data sources include Oracle (Oracle), Microsoft (MSFT), SAP (SAP), Amazon Redshift (AMZN), Teradata (TDC), Hadoop, and modern streaming data sources. The company has OEM relationships with Microsoft and Amazon where the companies embed Attunity's solution into their own when data replication is called for.Attunity's revenue grew quickly in the 2014-2015 time frame, with 43% growth in 2014 and 36% growth in 2015. This growth was driven by the need to gather data from various corporate sources and assemble it into data warehouses for analysis. Attunity has a simple but powerful solution that enables a much faster time to analysis for its customers. Attunity is admittedly a smaller player in the market facing bigger competition in Informatica (INFA) and IBM (IBM), but its solution is robust and has proven successful for its customer base. In 2014 and 2015, Attunity mostly sold into smaller opportunities of $1 million or less with six to nine month sales cycles. By 2016, Attunity's success and increasing name recognition began to attract larger deals with longer sales cycles and different sales team requirements. The company found that some of its sales force was not up to the task and revenue only grew 11% as some large deals slipped during the year.makeArticleAd();Attunity management acknowledged the problem and swapped out 15 of its weaker sales hands and replaced them with more experienced enterprise software sales people. Our work suggests that the company's problem in 2016 was indeed company-specific as the market for its type of software remained robust. Management is convinced that the worst of its sales issues are behind it and this was borne out by a beat and raise December quarter. The company notched sales of $15.6 million versus expectations of $14.3 million. Guidance for 2017 was set at $62-65 million, above consensus of $60 million.We believe that after the company's tough 2016, management is guiding more conservatively for 2017 than it did last year. The market seems to be supportive of growth rates seen in 2014 and 2015, yet neither the management team nor the analysts want to get ahead of themselves at this point. Given the very high gross margins in this business (90%), there is a ton of operating leverage once revenue gets moving. Management guided to 5-8% operating margins in 2017 but these could go much higher, especially in 2018, if revenue ramps ahead of plan.We value ATTU on an enterprise value to revenue basis based on 2018 numbers. Based on our current 2018 revenue forecast, ATTU trades at 1.6x revenue. We believe it should trade at a substantially higher multiple of 3x. The closest public comp, Talend SA (TLND) trades at 4x 2018 numbers and operates in essentially the same market. At 3x, ATTU would be worth $14.72, or 84% higher than its current trading price.In terms of an endgame, Attunity could grow organically for an extended period in this large market, but it could also present an interesting acquisition target for a larger strategic or financial player. The CEO, Shimon Alon, is the largest shareholder with 8% of the stock, so he has a considerable financial interest in the company's future. Interestingly Microsoft, as an OEM partner, has right of first refusal for any acquisition proposed by another party. This demonstrates the importance of ATTU to Microsoft and presumably to its other OEM partner.Attunity is a bit of a relic in its perpetual license revenue model. While most software companies today are in the Software-as-a-Service ((SAAS)) model, Attunity's customer base demands ownership of its software products, so it sells to them in a perpetual fashion. This business model is a two-edged sword as revenue above/below forecast drops to the bottom line and causes large EPS beats/misses. The main risk for Attunity is that some deals slip out of a quarter causing a revenue and earnings shortfall.See alsoBuffett Fleeing Wal-Mart: Beginning Of The End For The Giant Retailer?on seekingalpha.com"

Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock Could Win Big With ‘Windows Cloud’;2/15/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsNot long ago,Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) perfected the art of the big reveal. New Apple product announcements would be shrouded in mystery for weeks, and then the late Steve Jobs would get up on a stage and wow consumers and investors alike with the first-ever iPhone, the first-ever iPad or the first-ever iPod. AAPL stock would get an automatic 10% to 15% bump in the days that followed. CouldMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) have a similarly secretive catalyst in its so-called Windows Cloud product?makeArticleAd();Source:Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified)Windows Cloud is a mysterious operating system that was revealed via leaks, prompting a ""nothing to share"" response from Microsoft last week.What Is the Windows Cloud?A couple websites posted screen shots of Microsoft's yet-to-be-announced operating system, which would only run Windows Store apps designed to run on both desktop computers and mobile devices. The thought is that the Windows Cloud would supplement, not replace, the company's Windows 10 platform, which is only 18 months old.The Windows Cloud is already being viewed as Microsoft's answer toAlphabet Inc's(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Chrome OS. And by utilizing only its own apps, the platform could have a security advantage over Chrome, which uses non-native apps. That could position Windows 10 as a more appealing option to public institutions like schools, where protecting students' computers from outside apps or games can be difficult.Not much else is known about the Windows Cloud platform. And that's probably how Microsoft likes it. Although Wall Street didn't immediately embrace the top-secret new product by snatching up MSFT stock in droves, the real test will be when the company actually does its big Windows Cloud reveal. Will the platform impress enough to have an AAPL-like effect on Microsoft stock?7 Dividend Stocks Rewarding Shareholders With a RaiseClick to EnlargeFirst, let's look at how MSFT stock has been behaving lately.There was  big spike in MSFT stock last month has since been followed by a sharp retreat; however, the stock is still hovering above its 25- and 50-day moving averages, as well as two-month support in the $62-range.What you don't see is any kind of Microsoft stock price movement in the days since the Windows Cloud leak occurred. That means investors aren't quite sure exactly what the Windows Cloud is and how it could affect MSFT's business, which is why there has been no sudden rush to buy MSFT.If more details leak out, that could potentially move the needle. For now, though, the Windows Cloud remains a relative mystery that likely has Wall Street more confused than excited.MSFT Stock Is Strong Even Without the 'Cloud'In the meantime, Microsoft looks good on its own merits. MSFT stock is up nearly 30% in the last year, nearly 50% in the last two years, still trades at less than 20 times forward earnings estimates, and is expected to grow earnings-per-share by more than 6% this year and more than 9% next year. Sprinkle in a potential game changer in the Windows Cloud, and there's no reason to suspect Microsoft stock is going to suddenly backtrack.On the contrary, the recent mini-dip is a prime buying opportunity, so long as it holds above those short-term moving averages. I'd buy MSFT stock right here, with the hope that a future Windows Cloud unveiling could spark a quick run-up the way Apple's secret product launches used to.As of this writing, Chris Fraley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 Super-Safe Dividend Growth Stocks to Buy Today7 Tech Stocks That Could Implode at Any MinuteThe postMicrosoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock Could Win Big With 'Windows Cloud'appeared first onInvestorPlace."

Should I Buy Qualcomm, Inc. (QCOM) Stock? 3 Pros, 3 Cons;2/15/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsA few years ago,Qualcomm, Inc.(NASDAQ:QCOM) seemed like a sure bet. Hey, with its CDMA platform, the company was at the heart of the fast-growing mobile market. QCOM stock was essentially a cash machine.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockYet lately the company has been in a slump. Since the summer of 2014, QCOM stock has lost about a third of its value. Of course, the tech industry is chock-full of examples of darlings that fell on hard times.And yes, it can take time to get back into growth mode again. Although, when this happens, the gains can certainly be standout. Just look at the comeback ofMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT), which is up about 90% during the past couple years.So in the case of Qualcomm stock, is there much upside or should investors remain wary? Let's take a look at three pros and three cons and find out:QCOM Stock ProsMobile Powerhouse:The roots of QCOM go back to the mid-1980s, when seven engineers teamed up to capitalize on the mobile industry. At first they focused on technologies to provide location-based services and messaging for the trucking industry. Then after a few years, QCOM would go big - that is, develop a standard, called CDMA, which would allow for better cellular communications.The business model was to license the technology, which would mean getting aggressive with patents. While success was not immediate, QCOM was determined to make CDMA a critical part of the mobile industry. And of course, this wager ultimately paid off handsomely. For example, just some of QCOM's marquee customers includeApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL),Samsung Electronics(OTCMKTS:SSNLF),XiaomiandAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG).7 Tech Stocks That Could Implode at Any MinuteMegatrends:The mobile market is expected to grow at a nice pace, which should mean continued demand for Qualcomm offerings. There are currently about 4 billion 3G/4G connections using CMDA systems and this is expected to increase to6.4 billion by 2020. But there should also be substantial benefits from the emergence of 5G technologies. These will allow for better performance for the Internet of Things (IoT), wearables, autonomous vehicles, virtual reality and even remote medical procedures. While QCOM's R&D investments will be vital for capitalizing on these trends, the company has also ramped upped its deal-making. No doubt, the most notable example of this isthe proposed $38 billion acquisitionofNXP Semiconductors NV(NASDAQ:NXPI). Note that the company is one of the top players in the fast-growing market for self-driving cars.Financials:Granted, QCOM's revenues are not growing at a fast clip. In the latest quarter, there was a4% increase. But then again, the company is fairly mature, so it can be tough to churn out strong growth. Yet QCOM remains a highly profitable business, with fiscal 2016 net income coming to$6.7 billion. The company has also been shareholder friendly. Keep in mind that the current yield is at an attractive 4%.QCOM Stock ConsLitigation:Because of the extensive patent portfolio, QCOM collects a hefty royalty from most sales of smartphones across the globe - even for those devices that do not even include any of the technology! So as should be no surprise, there is much concern about this. The Chinese governmentchallenged QCOM's practices, and the case was eventually settled.But there are other major cases that are in the early stages, such as in South Korea, Europe and the U.S. Oh, and Apple has also launchedseveral major lawsuits against QCOM. The company certainly has tremendous resources to wage a brutal fight. Now as with any legal dispute, it is tough to predict the outcome. But if QCOM ultimately loses, then its core business model will be in jeopardy and this could certainly have horrendous consequences. Keep in mind that the company gets about80% of its pretax profits from licensing.Trump Factor:A key part of the president's agenda is to get tough against China, which Trump considers a currency manipulator. He has also called for stiff tariffs and sanctions. So if there is a trade war, the impact is likely to be adverse to U.S.-based companies that derives substantial revenues from China. Let's face it, the government is cracking down, favoring domestic-based operators over foreign ones. All in all, this poses material risks for QCOM. After all, about57% of revenuescome from China and Hong Kong.Competition:It is intense. Some of the tough rivals includeBroadcom Ltd(NASDAQ:AVGO) andTexas Instruments Incorporated(NASDAQ:TXN). There are also a variety of startups that are gunning for the mobile market. YetIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) may ultimately be the biggest threat to Qualcomm. Last year, Intel entered an agreement with Apple to supply chips. Before this, QCOM was thesole supplier.In other words, if the legal battles go against the company, Intel may be in a better position to snag more and more business.Bottom Line on QCOM StockWith the recent slide in Qualcomm stock, the valuation is definitely attractive. Consider that the forward price-to-earnings multiple is only about 11.5X.3 Reasons Sears Holdings Corp (SHLD) Stock Is Heading to ZeroBut this may not matter much. For the most part, the impact of the litigation is far from clear - and of course, legal disputes often move at a glacial pace. So in light of this, it's probably best to avoid QCOM stock for now.Tom Taulli runs the InvestorPlace blogIPO Playbookand also has his own free iOS app to estimate your tax refund, which is atPathwayTax.com.Follow him on Twitter at@ttaulli.

Should I Buy General Motors Company (GM) Stock? 3 Pros, 3 Cons;2/15/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsGeneral Motors Company(NYSE:GM) has certainly made a tremendous comeback since 2008, after having to declare bankruptcy. But there has been little for investors to cheer about. Back in late 2010, the company pulled off its IPO at $33 a share. But now GM stock is at only $37.20.makeArticleAd();Source:William Oliver via Flickr (Modified)To put things into perspective,InvestorPlace.com'sDana Blankenhorn has noted: ""Ever since the 2008 crash and government bailout, General Motors stock has been treated like dirt. No matter what GM does, it can't get out of first gear.""I actually think this is an understatement!Of course, Wall Street can be inexplicable. Yet eventually investors will recognize the value. Hey, this has happened with other stocks that languished for a long time, such asMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT), right?OK then, so would GM stock be a good play right now? Or should investors hold off? Well, to see, let's take a look at 3 pros and cons on General Motors:3 Pros On GM StockMomentum: For the past two years, General Motors has posted record earnings, net revenues, EBITDA and free cash flows. As forlast year, revenues increased by 9.2% to $166.4 billion and free cash flows came to $6.9 billion, up $4.7 billion from the previous year.7 Tech Stocks That Could Implode at Any MinuteThen again, General Motors has continued to pump out popular cars, with global sales at 10 million (making the company the No. 3 player). A big part of this has been the continued success in North America. But of course, China remains a major factor as well. Last year GM reported3.87 million car sales in the country. Keep in mind that the company sells more in China than any country, including the U.S.But GM has also been judicious with discounts and promotions. For the most part, GM is focused on making sure it makes profits, not just on increasing marketshare.Innovation: One of the hottest categories in technology is the auto industry, as seen with the efforts with operators likeAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG),Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) andTesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA). The good news is that GM has been ramping up its investments. To this end, the company made a $500 million investment inLyft(a top ride-sharing startup) as well as a $1 billion acquisition ofCruise Automation(a developer of autonomous car systems).Already there are signs that GM is getting traction. For example, the company is testing over 40 autonomous Bolt EVs. But there are also some other innovations, like Maven. This is a mobile platform that allows a person to search and reserve a car and unlock it with a smartphone. According toGM: ""With more than 25 million customers around the world projected to use some form of shared mobility by 2020, Maven is a key element of our strategy to changing ownership models in the automotive industry.""It's important to note that GM has the advantage of leveraging its experience with OnStar, which has been around for two decades. In fact, during this time, the system has logged about1.5 billion customer interactions.Yield & Valuation: GM has certainly been shareholder friendly. Last year, the company returned a hefty $4.8 billion - in a combination of share buybacks and dividends. In fact, GM stock has a nice yield of 4.1%.But the valuation is also attractive. Consider that the forward price-to-earnings ratio is at a lowly 6.1X. True, this may be deserved for a company that is showing declining growth. But as for General Motors, the company expects to increase the top line for 2017.In other words, the stock does look like a great value play right now.3 Cons on GM StockCompetition: The environment is brutal. And with more dealmaking, things will only get more intense. An example of this is the alliance ofRenault SAandNissan Motor Co Ltd (ADR)(OTCMKTS:NSANY) - which also involved the purchase of a large stake inMitsubishi Motors. With this, the companies were able to realize significant cost savings and also hit a global sales number of nearly 10 million last year.Although, accordingFiat SpA(ADR)(OTCMKTS:FIATY) CEO Sergio Marchionne, an automaker may need to reach levels of15 million cars sold annually to be competitive! The reason is that R&D will inevitably increase because of the enormous costs of new technologies.As a result, a company like GM may have little choice but to look for a similar alliance or a transformative acquisition, which would definitely be risky and expensive.Politics: The election of Donald Trump is a wild card for the auto industry. On the one hand, there are potential positives, such as with lower corporate tax rates and less onerous regulations.But these may not offset the issues with Trump's anti-trade bent. If there is a border tax, this could hurt GM because of its substantial production in Mexico. Actually, about 20% of light production is in the country. So if there is a border tax, it could mean higher prices in the U.S. - and yes, lower sales. According to theWall Street Journal: ""Even a more modest border tax under consideration would wipe out a quarter of GM's regional profit.""Global Issues:While the markets in China and North America have been robust for GM, there has been much softness in many other areas, such as in Europe and South America. Granted, there are signs of improvement - but the progress has been fairly slow. For example, in South America, GM has been able to cut back on the losses. But there was still $374 million in red ink last year.As for Europe, the growth has been sluggish across the continent. It also does not help that England has enacted the Brexit, which has caused a lot of uncertainty. As a result, GM lost $300 million in Europe last year and it appears there will not be break-even until 2018. To put things into perspective, the company has not seen a profit in the region since 2000!Bottom Line On GM StockPerhaps the biggest issue facing GM stock is the uncertainty regarding Trump's trade actions. Although, given the importance of the auto industry to the US economy, it does seem reasonable that any moves will likely be taken with care. Besides, General Motors CEO Mary Barra has been savvy to meet with Trump several times already.Gas Up With Chesapeake Energy Corporation (CHK) StockIn the meantime, she is doing a great job managing the core operations of the company. Note that there will be 18 new or refreshed models for five main brands in 2017, up from 13 last year. And yes, Barra has been aggressive with investments in new technologies.OK, so is GM stock a good buy right now? I think so, especially given the rock-bottom valuation.Tom Taulli runs the InvestorPlace blogIPO Playbookand also has his own free iOS app to estimate your tax refund, which is atPathwayTax.com.Follow him on Twitter at@ttaulli.

These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.Click here to find out which 9 other ETFs had   notable inflows »"

How Citrix Systems Inc. Is Repositioning Itself for Future Growth;2/15/2017;"Desktop virtualization services providerCitrix Systems(NASDAQ: CTXS) has made two big moves this year to shuffle its   product portfolio. First, it acquired application management   company Unidesk to shore up its core offerings. Then, it   completed thespinoffof its GoTo business toLogMeIn.Citrix has made these moves to streamline its product   portfolio, increasing its focus on its enterprise offerings and   becoming a pure-play software-as-a-service company. The spinoff   of GoTo and the acquisition of Unidesk will enable Citrix to ramp   up product development efforts in its two biggest segments by   revenue -- workspace services and delivery networking.Image source: Citrix Systems.makeArticleAd();Falling behind the competitionCitrix revenue has grown at a compound annual rate of 4% over   the past four fiscal years. That's way lower than the 33% annual   growth seen in the virtualization desktop infrastructure market   from 2009 to 2016, according to ABI Research. And that means   Citrix has failed to take advantage of the rapid industry   growth.Evidently, the company needs to reshuffle its offerings, as   there are still a lot of opportunities in the desktop   virtualization market. But to do so, it will need to focus   aggressively on the core businesses that drive the majority of   its top line.Workspace services and delivery networking businesses account   for 72% of total revenue, but they've grown at a very slow pace   in the past four years -- the former at just 2.3% annually and   the latter at 5.2%. To make more significant progress in these   segments, Citrix needs to spend more time and money on product   development to fight off competition from the likes ofVMware.In fact, Citrix has lost its innovative edge in this space to   VMware, which has a better strategy to tap the end market. IDC   ranked VMware as the leader in its magic quadrant chart because   of its acquisition strategy, while Citrix came in second.How Citrix is gearing up for growthCitrix should now be able to scale its core businesses by   giving them more time and R&D dollars. For example, the   company will incorporate Unidesk's layering technology into its   XenDesktop and XenApp services.Layering is an application packaging and management technology   that allows users to separate enterprise-related applications   from the operating system. This feature will enable Citrix   customers to manage the apps on their employees' devices from a   single location, without the need for physical inspection. Since   Unidesk is the only provider of full-stack layering technology,   Citrix has made a smart move with this acquisition.Citrix is also partnering withMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) on the Azure cloud computing platform. Azure is   Citrix' preferred cloud platform for service delivery, which is a   big positive for investors, since Microsoft's cloud service has   seen rapid growth in adoption. In the second quarter of fiscal   2017, Azure revenue increased a massive 93% year over year, which   pushed the revenue from Microsoft's commercial cloud business to   $14 billion.Microsoft is now ranked second in the public cloud afterAmazonWeb Services, and the rapid growth in Azure adoption has led to a   revenue increase at the company's channel partners. Citrix, for   its part, has been enhancing its offerings on Microsoft Azure by   making improvements to its XenDesktop service.Last month, Citrix introduced XenDesktop Essentials for   Microsoft Azure to deliver the Windows 10 software. Using this   service, Azure customers can deliver apps to devices running on   the platform in a secure manner. What's more, Citrix will   continue to enrich its Microsoft Azure offerings by adding more   apps such as Secure Web and Secure Mail.These moves should allow Citrix to attract more clients as it   focuses on offering a comprehensive suite of solutions. In fact,   Citrix' product-development moves are bearing fruit already, as   it won 96 new contracts with a value of more than $1 million each   in the fourth quarter. In comparison, there were 81 such   transactions in the year-ago period.In all, Citrix closed 850 contracts in virtual client   computing last quarter itself, up from 800 last year. The company   should be able to sustain this growth in the long run as the   desktop virtualization market gets bigger. For perspective,   TechNavio forecasts that the virtual desktop infrastructure   market will grow at an annual pace of 11% from 2017 to 2021.Citrix is gearing up to take advantage of this potential   growth by repositioning its portfolio under the leadership of CEO   Kirill Tatarinov, who was hired last year. Tatarinov's plan for   Citrix is to encourage cloud adoption among enterprises by   reducing complexity and offering enhanced security. The company's   recent moves clearly indicate that the CEO is taking concrete   steps in this direction by streamlining its offerings to power   long-term growth.10 stocks we like better than Citrix SystemsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Warren Buffett's Huge Stake in Apple: What He May See In AAPL;2/15/2017;"Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A,BRK-B) have long been adverse to investing in technology companies. That mantra started to change in 2011, when Berkshire startedinvestingin IBM (IBM).Since then, his investment manager lieutenants, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, have added to Berkshire's investment portfolio, buying up stakes in technology companies, but never to the size and scope of the IBM investment, which was $11 billion at the time.Now, it looks as if Buffett is doing it again -- this time with Apple (AAPL).makeArticleAd();In a recently released SEC filing, Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway revealed it now owns a sizable stake in the Cupertino, Calif.-based tech giant. At the end of the fourth-quarter, it owned  57.4 million shares, up from 15.2 million shares in a previous filing. At current prices, the stake is worth just over $7 billion, likely making the stake with Buffett's approval, if not done himself.Without putting words into his mouth, the Apple stake is likely similar to IBM in Buffett's eyes, as the venerable iPhone maker is becoming a services company, one with steady revenue coming from dependable subscriptions.Buffett's investment isn't about what technology is the ""next big thing,"" whether augmented reality is asbigas Apple thinks it will be or whether Apple is really making a car or not. It's pure and simple economics and the attractiveness of the subscription model.In Apple's fiscal first-quarter, itgenerated$7.1 billion in Service revenue, from things like Apple Music, iTunes, the App Store, Apple Pay and more. It's the healthiest portion of Apple's business, one that's growing at 18% year-over-year. CEO Tim Cook hassaidthat Apple's Service business will be the size of a Fortune 500 company sometime this year, indicating that growth isn't slowing down anytime soon.Yes, Apple is still beholden to sales of the iPhone, iPad and the Mac for the majority of its revenue, but the Service business is slowly, but surely, making Apple's revenue smoother and less lumpier from a quarterly perceptive. Visible, growing revenue is worth significantly more than revenue from hardware that acts like a roller coaster, with ups and downs.All investors need to do is look at the earnings multiples for companies like Salesforce.com (CRM), Microsoft (MSFT) and others to see the positive impact. Companies that have enormous subscription-based revenue, which put off tremendous amounts of operating cash flow in a predictable manner are ultimately more valuable than ones that do not.The company has a goal of doubling its Service revenue by 2020, which is an admittedly large task. But with a user base of over 1 billion active devices, Apple should be able to continue to grow parts of its Service business, like Apple Music and the App Store, as it continues to add new features (namely, TV shows for Apple Music).It's likely we will hear more about Buffett's Apple stake in the days and weeks to come. If we do get commentary from the Oracle of Omaha himself, expect Services and predictable revenue to be a big part of the line of thinking.I know it would be for me."

Why Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock Could Fly to $1,000 in 2017;2/15/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsI've said it before, and I'll say it again:Amazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) will take over the world. While the general public obsesses over bad hair and the color orange, I think we face a bigger threat. Amazon's drones and their uncanny way of doing business will fundamentally alter commerce as we know it. Note that I didn't say ""e-commerce."" When you dominate as much as AMZN stock has, your industry no longer requires a qualifying prefix.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockAnybody that doubts that AMZN stock could hit the$1,000 marksimply needs to peruse theircustomer serviceoptions.If you ever encounter an issue using Amazon, the company will take care of you promptly. Should you need immediate, on the spot assistance, AMZN will take you to a special menu screen. From there, you enter your phone number, and literally within seconds, you will be directed to a company representative.We all know firsthand how frustrating most customer service experiences are. I wouldn't be surprised if some companies deliberately promote poor service just so you won't call them. This of course is just another reason why Amazon stock is so special. They could rest on their laurels. They could kick back and relax, knowing that their status as king is unchallenged. Yet they still have the same hunger that they did back in the late 1990s.Maybe that's why AMZN stock is one of the greatest investments in history, while generational internet peersNetscapeandLycosarehistory.AMZN Stock Teeing Up for An Explosive 2017I can go on a full-blown rant listing all the reasons why every investor should at least consider Amazon stock, but a recent development in the markets really solidified the bullish argument. As you know, AMZN stock didn't do so well when Donald Trump won the general election on Nov. 8. Within a few days, shares had fallen by as much as 9%. This is understandable considering the bitter and contentious political campaign season.10 Super-Safe Dividend Growth Stocks to Buy TodayEven by the end of 2016, AMZN stock was conspicuously lower than its pre-election result close. However, that changed dramatically at the start of the new year. Amazon stock gained some much-needed traction, and shot above the $800-mark. Since breaching that psychological barrier, AMZN has yet to fall back below it. And for January, Amazon saw a robust 9% return.This is important because January is typically not a good time for Amazon stock. Of all the opening months going back to 1998, shares average an extremely pedestrian 0.6%. However, annual returns from 1998 through 2016 average 84%.Such huge discrepancies made me wonder - are there indicators in January that predict how AMZN stock will do later?Click to EnlargeThe answer is a resounding yes.This past January's performance for AMZN stock was the fourth best overall. Of the three other times that Amazon stock posted better opening months, investors later saw average annual returns of 120%. Inclusive of every positive January, AMZN still nets an amazing average annual return of 100%.That's not all. Of the seven years in which Amazon took a loss, six had Januarys that also incurred red ink. The one exception occurred in 2001, during the immediate aftermath of the tech bubble bursting. As long as January holds up, it's highly unlikely to be on the losing end.Amazon's Fundamentals Look Great Too!I don't recommend making a decision on an opportunity on the basis of a sole metric or indicator. The same can be said about statistical data. Even the best-reasoned and logical calculations can't account for every variable. Just like the election of President Trump, there are certain elements of unpredictability that can and will bite you.Another Take - Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN): Is It Time to Start Worrying?However, with AMZN stock, I think investors have a little more buffer to play with thanks to its solid fundamentals. Primarily, Amazon is still innovating. We saw a bit of that during the Super Bowl commercial featuring Amazon Prime Air. It's also a dominant player in cloud computing, frustrating companies likeMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT),SAP SE (ADR)(NYSE:SAP),International Business Machines Corp.(NYSE:IBM) andOracle Corporation(NYSE:ORCL).And while I acknowledge it's risky for AMZN stock if it doesn't work out, I like Amazon's venture into groceries. Granted, I'm not crazy on possible rumors that the company is thinking about rolling out2,000 stores. But if they do this right - particularly in trendy places like their Seattle hometown - AMZN could have another winner on its hands.These underlying drivers provide the confidence for investors willing to bet that Amazon stock will hit quadruple digits. However, what can't be denied is the momentum. When AMZN gets hot, it almost always stays hot. For many, that will be the nudge they need to make their final decision.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace7 Tech Stocks That Could Implode at Any Minute12 Stocks That Will Live and Die by Donald Trump's PenThe postWhy Amazon.com, Inc.

Apple Inc. (AAPL) Tips its Hand on iPhone 8 Wireless Charging;2/14/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThere are always plenty of rumors flying around aboutApple Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AAPL) coming iPhone releases. Usually, these are based on information leaked from the AAPL supply chain, but on a very few occasions, Apple itself inadvertently tips its hand.makeArticleAd();Source: Wireless Power ConsortiumThat appears to be the case with the iPhone 8. For several months, the 10th anniversary release has been rumored to feature wireless charging. Thanks to an AAPL move, that now seems like a lock.AAPL Joins the Wireless Power ConsortiumBusiness Insiderbroke the newsthat Apple has joined the Wireless Power Consortium (or WPC). WPC is an industry association that oversees Qi, the most widely used wireless charging technology. That puts AAPL in a group with over 220 other companies that are members, including smartphone rivalSamsung Electronic(OTCMKTS:SSNLF), whose Galaxy S7 supports Qi wireless charging.Apple does already use Qi wireless charging for the Apple Watch, but the company tweaked its implementation so it's not compatible with standard Qi chargers. And it never bothered to join WPC - until now. That move is a very strong indicator that AAPL is planning to incorporate Qi wireless charging on a larger scale, and that points to the iPhone 8.7 Dividend Stocks for the Retirement You DeserveApple confirmed it had joined WPC (although the confirmation isn't really necessary given that it's nowlisted as a memberon the organization's website), but it did so by trying to minimize the implications. A company spokesperson toldBusiness Insider:""Apple is an active member of many standards development organizations, as both a leader and contributor. Apple is joining the Wireless Power Consortium to be able to participate and contribute ideas to the open, collaborative development of future wireless charging standards. We look forward to working together with the WPC and its members.""What WPC Membership Means for iPhone 8 Wireless ChargingDespite AAPL's attempt to position its move as business as usual, joining WPC is a strong indication that rumors about the iPhone 8 offering wireless charging have been on the mark. However, Qi isn't the advanced, over-the-air wireless charging many people had been hoping AAPL would implement.Instead, Qi - which has been in use since 2011- uses inductive charging. Rather than plugging an iPhone into a charger with a Lightning cable, it would be placed on a charge pad. So there's still a recharger that requires physical contact, and that recharger is still plugged into the wall.And it seems very plausible that wireless charging would be supported by the iPhone 8, but only offered as an extra at an additional cost. There has already been speculation that AAPL would useoptional wireless chargingto further drive up the amount consumers spend on a new iPhone purchase. In this case, they would have to add an Apple wireless charger to the tab (somethingSamsung charges an additional $49.99 forwith the Galaxy S7).Couldn't iPhone 8 buyers simply buy one of the many Qi charge pads already on the market? They would undoubtedly be less expensive than Apple's version.Well, there's also a good chance that AAPL could pull a move like it did with the Apple Watch, tweaking its Qi implementation slightly so someone buying the new iPhone couldn't simply use a standard third-party Qi charger.Will Qi Wireless Charging Make the iPhone 8 More Desirable?IHS Technology noted thepopularity of wireless charging with consumers, suggesting it was a feature AAPL couldn't ignore with the iPhone 8:""The success of wireless charging adoption from Apple's competitors is something that Apple can no longer ignore. IHS Technology consumer survey data shows over 90% of consumers want wireless charging on their next device.""Consumers may be expecting somethingmorefrom the iPhone 8, though.Qi wireless charging is mainstream now, and there were hopes Apple would adopttruewireless charging, going with over-the-air technology instead of following the pack. Many smartphone buyers skip Qi charging altogether (the charge pad can actually be larger and more cumbersome than a plug-in charger), especially if it's an additional cost.The ability to set a device on furniture or other accessories like speaker systems ordesk lamps that have integrated QI charge padsis cool, but if AAPL chooses to go with a non-standard implementation, those probably wouldn't work with the iPhone 8.Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock Is on Cloud 9It may end up that wireless charging on the iPhone 8 is essentially a marketing move - a way to make extra money from those who care, and a bullet point on the features list that keeps the new iPhone on par with the competition. Or maybe AAPL engineers will pull off something unexpected.Either way, now that Apple has officially joined the WPC, you can expect Qi wireless charging on the iPhone 8.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace9 Top Pharmaceutical Stocks to Buy for the Dividends10 Super-Safe Dividend Growth Stocks to Buy TodayThe postApple Inc.

Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock Is on Cloud 9;2/14/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSome market prognosticators may tell you it's high time to get your head out of the clouds. But ifMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) is part of the conversation, cloud-chasing with a modified, hedged position in Microsoft stock has rarely looked this good.makeArticleAd();Source:Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified)It has been a few months since my last writing aboutMicrosoft stock's bullish prospectsboth off and on the price chart. Gains of around 8% in shares have been good, though not entirely impressive given theS&P 500's9% andNasdaq's8.5% increases over the same period.But this strategist continues to believe MSFT stock has only just begun to scratch the surface for investors when it comes to delivering shareholder value beyond healthy stock buybacks, dividend increases and the like.Not that those factors should be dismissed, but the real narrative in Microsoft stock worth paying attention to is the company's continued strong execution in growth areas outside of the PC market.For one, Microsoft's commercial cloud business continues to support better-than-expected top- and bottom-line results at the corporate confessional each quarter. In fact, with double-digit revenue growth and annual sales of $20 billion expected by next summer, Microsoft's cloud is big business.9 Top Pharmaceutical Stocks to Buy for the DividendsAnd we're not alone in thinking Microsoft's cloud acumen is not being fully appreciated.CNBC'sJames Cramer said as much Mondaywhen discussing the company as far more than a software and PC shop and saying it's time to take notice of Microsoft's cloud business.Other investors think there'smuch, much more to Microsoftunder the driven stewardship of CEO Satya Nadella as well. His ""Mobile First, Cloud First"" philosophy and technological vision for Microsoft should help set a path of growth for the next decade as the disruptive Internet of Things becomes more pervasive.Microsoft Stock Monthly ChartMicrosoft stock is currently trading just off recent all-time highs secured in the immediate aftermath of its earnings results. The provided monthly view of MSFT shows an overall constructive situation and room for shares to continue their rally.Prior to breaking above 1999's all-time high near $60, Microsoft stock put in a good deal of consolidation work in the form of a nearly two-year-long base-on-base pattern.The lengthy and durable platform has allowed for a successful launch into uncharted territory for MSFT shares. It has also helped keep the rally from becoming too steep in its trajectory and potentially prone to crumbling under its own weight.A daily pullback pattern above the 50-day simple moving average and prior highs, as well as oversold stochastic condition help to confirm the larger bullish set-up. Technically speaking and for intermediate-term investors, a trailing stop loss of 5% - 8% is viewed as reasonable in keeping with the big picture both on and off the Microsoft stock chart.MSFT Stock Modified Collar StrategyReviewing the MSFT options board, I like using a modified collar on Microsoft stock for positioning as part of a core holding within a portfolio.Specifically and with MSFT at $64.35, an investor can sell the April $67.50 call for 51 cents and simultaneously buy the April $62.50/$60 bear put spread for 51 cents.Combined with stock, the transaction costs $64.35, or the same as a naked long position in Microsoft stock, but with the benefit of hedging some of the downside risk.Using this type financial engineering on MSFT, the bullish investor maintains nearly 5% of upside into April expiration with the sold $67.50 call initially capping profits at $3.15 per spread.Stay FAR Away From Freeport-McMoRan Inc (FCX) StockThe max gain for this Microsoft stock position is unadjusted and calculated on an expiration basis, but does have the potential for larger gains if the investor rolls the position beyond the initial hedge.If MSFT shares decline, the bear put spread portion of the combo affords the trader a partial, but very effective hedge from $62.50 - $60. The positioning is in keeping with our discussed 'stop-loss' zone which looks technically important. Lastly, in using a modified collar during a non-earnings cycle and a period where the expectation is for lesser or at least contained price volatility, the price is definitely right for this no-cost strategy.Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in any of the securities or their derivatives mentioned in this article.

Bitcoin Meets Starbucks: iPayYou's Bold Bet Goes Live;2/14/2017;"By Michael ScottWith 2017 in full motion, Bitcoin’s price climb to the mid-$900 range and beyond continues to raise eyebrows. For many, this milestone is just one signal of cryptocurrency’s growing repute as a legitimate store of investment value.Little attention, however, has been given to Bitcoin’s utility as a day-to-day method of payment. Practical use cases involving consumer adoption, in fact, are rarely talked about. This is despite the well-documented cost, efficiency and security advantages of the Bitcoin payment network for both consumers and businesses alike.makeArticleAd();A new U.S.-based startup company aims to change this through an effort to accelerate the everyday use of Bitcoin for consumers worldwide. Launched in May of 2016,iPayYouis an online platform and digital wallet that promotes the viability of Bitcoin as a method of payment. It immediately saw early success through a unique feature known as Pay-by-Twitter — the first online platform site for peer-to-peer payments over Twitter (TWTR).Now in a bold bet sure to deliver a caffeine jolt to the retail sector, iPayYou this past December introduced Bitcoin Direct to Starbucks (SBUX), a new way for coffee aficionados to pay for those espressos and other drinks through the use of Bitcoin.This feature allows users to seamlessly transfer bitcoins from their existing iPayYou Bitcoin wallet to their Starbucks mobile app. They select how much (in USD) they wish to transfer before prompting Bitcoin Direct to Starbucks to automatically withdraw that amount from their iPayYou account. Once deposited into that person’s Starbucks account, purchases can be made via the mobile app at any Starbucks location.This latest addition to the iPayYou platform comes on the heels of iPayYou’s recent gift card integration, allowing Bitcoin to be used for instant gift card purchases from retailers like Amazon (AMZN), Best Buy (BBY) and iTunes (AAPL).These creative payment applications are the mastermind of founder and CEO Gene Kavner, former Worldwide Director of Amazon Associates. With extensive experience in the world of commerce, including prominent positions at Microsoft (MSFT) and Expedia (EXPE), Kavner developed iPayYou with the intention of establishing a easy-to-use Bitcoin wallet with simple features and low costs.Regarding the strategic collaboration with Starbucks, Kavner remarks: “The broader significance of this move is that iPayYou is able to encourage Bitcoins to be spent in ways that its creators intended — for everyday purchases from popular merchants without needing a bank account to do so. This arrangement with Starbucks allows coffee lovers to replenish their primary Starbucks account with their Bitcoin holdings.  We’ve accomplished this feat without Starbucks having to directly accept Bitcoin. Our hope is that through this demonstration Starbucks will soon begin accepting Bitcoin directly, sooner rather than later.”In terms of advantages for Starbucks regulars, Kavner continues: “We intend to show that Bitcoin is not only a great investment but is also becoming quite useful in everyday life. Because so many of us are addicted to coffee, being able to use Bitcoin to purchase anything at Starbucks is an enormous win for everyday consumers. And Starbucks will benefit too due to the amount of Bitcoin users who will now become customers.”Over time, Kavner believes that initiatives like this will encourage merchant acceptance of Bitcoin. “Probably the most important metric that every merchant looks at when deciding what methods of payment to accept is how many new customers will it help attract. A key reason for the slow merchant adoption of Bitcoin has been the relatively limited amount of people who wanted to use Bitcoin for POS transactions. Now, I believe that more and more will.”In terms of what’s next for Bitcoin Direct for 2017 and beyond, Kavner is optimistic: “We’re going to continue to make Bitcoin easier, safer and more useful over 2017 and beyond. We are planning on expanding to enable more merchant adoption as well as adding many features that every Bitcoin wallet should have. At the same time, we’ll make Bitcoin simple to understand, not just to those of us who know and love Bitcoin already but for the everyday consumer who may not even know what Bitcoin is. We’ll continue to innovate to make Bitcoin easier and more useful for everyone.”"

Tuesday’s Vital Data: Tesla Inc (TSLA), Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD) and Microsoft Corporation (MSFT);2/14/2017;"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsU.S. stock futures are showing signs of nerves this morning, as Wall Street prepares for Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen to testify to the Senate Banking Committee later this morning. Yellen will also appear before the House Financial Services panel tomorrow, and analysts will be scrutinizing her testimony for any clues on the future of interest rate hikes and monetary policy - especially after Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia President Patrick Harker said last week that a rate hike was ""on the table"" for March.makeArticleAd();With monetary policy on the mind, the markets started lower, but at last check, futures on theDow Jones Industrial Averagewere up 0.02%,S&P 500futures were up 0.03% andNasdaq-100futures were roughly even.On the options front, volume remained well above average on Monday, with about 17.7 million calls and 14.1 million puts changing hands on the session. Over on the CBOE, the single-session equity put/call volume ratio dropped to a two-week low of 0.61, driving the 10-day moving average to 0.68.Turning to Monday's volume leaders,Tesla Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA) options volume was mixed following expectations that the company would tap capital markets in order to fund production of the Model 3 - which is scheduled to begin at the end of this month. Meanwhile,Gilead Sciences, Inc.(NASDAQ:GILD) saw heavy call volume ahead of last night's clinical trial results for its new experimental HIV drug. Finally,Microsoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) was flooded with calls ahead of today's ex-dividend date.Tesla Inc (TSLA)With earnings just around the corner - next Wednesday to be precise - Tesla is making waves on Wall Street after announcing that it will begin production of its Model 3 by the end of the month. News on the Model 3 front send TSLA stock higher, and prompted analysts atOppenheimer to commentthat Tesla could take advantage of its new stock highs to dip into the capital market to raise funds for Model 3 production, which could be seen as a bullish sentiment indicator.7 Dividend Stocks for the Retirement You DeserveSo far, however, options traders are reluctant to get out in front of Model 3 production, or next week's earnings report. Volume on Monday came in at a brisk 301,000 contracts, but calls only accounted for 54% of the day's take. But the lull in call volume may be due to the fact that short-term traders are already heavily bullish on TSLA stock.Looking at TSLA's 27 Feb action, the put/call open interest ratio comes in at 0.68, with calls clearly in command. Overall, implieds for the series are pricing in a potential move of about 7%, with the upper bound at $300 and the lower bound at $260.Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD)GILD stock rallied nearly 2% yesterday ahead ofclinical trial data on the company's new HIV drug, and it appears that Gilead bulls are about to be rewarded. The company said that its HIV treatment, Bictegravir, delivered 97% virus suppression, which is just as effective as the leading HIV treatment made byGlaxoSmithKline Plc (ADR)(NYSE:GSK). Furthermore, there were no cases of emerging resistance and no reported kidney problems, which can be an issue with HIV treatments.GILD stock is up another 1% in premarket activity following the report, and yesterday's call traders have to be cheering the results. On Monday, GILD saw volume rise to 258,000 contracts, with calls snapping up 75% of the day's take.Turning to the March series, options traders have taken out heavy call positions at the $67 through $75 strikes, with more than 5,500 contracts open at each. Peak call OI for the month numbers 7,600 contracts at the $75 strike, though that would be a long haul for GILD, which recently plunged on news of declining revenue for the company's Hep-C cure.Microsoft Corporation (MSFT)While MSFT stock received a nice pop near the end of January following Microsoft's quarterly report, the shares have been relatively quiet since. MSFT continues to hover just below long-term resistance in the $65-$66 region, though the longer-term trend remains steadily higher along support at its 10-week and 20-week moving averages.Intel Corporation (INTC) Stock Will Claw Its Way HigherOn Monday, options traders flooded MSFT stock, with total volume hitting a near-term high of more than 650,000 contracts. Calls made up an impressive 82% of yesterday's activity. But the action doesn't appear to be any new wave of bullish expectations, with traders instead focusing on dividend capture strategies ahead of today's ex-dividend trading.On that front,shareholders of recordas of the close yesterday are eligible for a dividend of 39 cents per share, payable on March 9.As of this writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace9 Top Pharmaceutical Stocks to Buy for the Dividends7 Marvelous Mid-Cap Stocks to Buy for the Best of All WorldsThe postTuesday's Vital Data: Tesla Inc (TSLA), Gilead Sciences, Inc.

Jeremy Grantham Trims Consumer Defensive and Technology Empire;2/13/2017;"Jeremy Grantham(Trades,Portfolio), chairman of Grantham, Mayo, Van Otterloo & Co., is regarded as a knowledgeable investor in various stock, bond and commodity markets. During fourth-quarter 2016, Grantham trimmed positions inProctor & Gamble Co.(PG),Cisco Systems Inc.(CSCO),Microsoft Corp.(MSFT) andQualcomm Inc.(QCOM).Proctor & GambleGrantham sold 3,100,701 shares of Proctor & Gamble, nearly 99% of his stake in the company. P&G's stock price averaged $85.23 during fourth-quarter 2016, and the company currently trades at $88.10 per share.makeArticleAd();Although P&G's profit margins and returns outperform close to 90% of competitors, the company has negative three-year revenue, EBITDA and earnings per share growth rates, suggesting decreasing growth potential.P&G reported modest earnings performance in its fiscal second-quarter, including flat net sales compared to the prior-year quarter. Organic sales increased 2% overall, offset by a -2% impact from foreign exchange. Additionally, the company's diluted earnings per share from continuing operations declined 8% from the prior-year quarter. For fiscal 2017, P&G expects its all-in sales to be on par with fiscal 2016 sales: although the company expects organic sales to grow by 2-3%, the headwinds from foreign exchange and minor brand divestitures offset the organic sales growth.As the company's price, price-book ratio and price-sales ratio are all near a 10-year high, P&G is significantly overvalued. The company's current price is close to its maximum price-sales valuation based on its P/S valuation bands chart. P&G is also overvalued based on several other valuation methods, including the earnings power value method and the projected free cash flow method.P&G's Yacktman forward-rate of return of 3.02% is near a 10-year low and underperforms 55% of global household & personal products companies. As the company offers low growth potential, the Yacktman Focused Fund (Trades, Portfolio) pared 0.99% of its stake in P&G.Cisco SystemsGrantham axed 26.15% of his stake in Cisco Systems, selling 6,169,165 shares at an average price of $30.49. With this transaction, the fund manager trimmed 0.92% off his portfolio.Cisco has a profitability rank of 9 and a four-star predictability rank, which normally suggests high growth potential. Despite having profit margins near a 10-year high, Cisco has returns on equity below its 10-year average. Additionally, the company's per-share revenue growth has slowed down, with a one-year revenue growth rate of -0.2%.For fiscal first-quarter 2017, Cisco reported revenues of $12.4 billion, net income of $2.3 billion and diluted earnings of 46 cents per share. Net income and diluted earnings declined 4% from the prior-year quarter while revenues increased just 1%. CEO Chuck Robbins expressed that Cisco, despite a ""challenging global business environment,"" still managed to lead customers in digital transformations through ""highly secure, automated and intelligent solutions.""Although management gave positive remarks about the company's performance, Cisco expects to have weaker earnings performance for fiscal second-quarter, including a normalized revenue decline of 2% to 4% year over year (not including SP Video CPE Business revenues from fiscal second-quarter 2016). The company also expects fiscal second-quarter EPS to fall within 42 cents to 47 cents, suggesting a potential decrease in earnings for the upcoming quarter.As the company has low earnings potential in the short term, several gurus reduced their position in Cisco Systems. Tweedy Browne (Trades, Portfolio) knocked off 9.34% while Steven Romick (Trades, Portfolio) trimmed 8.93%. John Hussman (Trades, Portfolio) axed 58.96% of his Cisco position, selling all but 104,400 shares.MicrosoftGrantham removed 17.45% of his Microsoft position, selling 2,981,525 shares at an average price of $60.15. With this transaction, the guru trimmed his portfolio 0.81%.Although Microsoft reported strong cloud revenues during fourth-quarter 2016, deeper analysis of the company's historical profitability and growth metrics suggests a modest financial outlook for early 2017. Microsoft's operating margins, despite outperforming 89% of global infrastructure companies, is currently near a 10-year low of 19.41%. Additionally, Microsoft's five-year average operating margin growth rate and gross margin growth rate are -10.30% and -4.80%, despite the company having gross margins of about 58.90%.PRIMECAP Management (Trades, Portfolio), who currently owns the largest number ofMicrosoft sharesamong gurus, pared 5.21% off its stake.QualcommGrantham reduced his Qualcomm position 17.89%, selling 1,482,356 shares at an average price of $67.18. With the transaction, the guru trimmed his portfolio 0.48%.On a non-GAAP basis, Qualcomm reported good earnings performance in fiscal first-quarter 2017 compared to the prior-year quarter. Despite this, Qualcomm had a poor quarter based on GAAP results, with operating income, net income and diluted earnings per share declining about 54% year-over-year and 57% from the prior quarter. The GAAP values included an $868 million accrued expense for fiscal first-quarter 2017 related to the Korea Free Trade Commission investigation.Qualcomm's operating margin is near a 10-year low of 21.37% despite outperforming 93% of global semiconductor companies. The company's operating margin declined 5% on average for the past five years. Additionally, Qualcomm's gross margin declined 2.6% on average.While Qualcomm's three-year average buyback rate outperforms 97% of competitors, the company bought back the overvalued shares. Qualcomm's stock price is trading about 17.2% lower than the average buyback price. The company also issued about $11.7 billion in long-term debt within the past three years.Disclosure:I do not have positions in the stocks mentioned in this article.Start afree 7-day trial of Premium Membershipto GuruFocus.Premium MembersThis article first appeared onGuruFocus."

3 Stocks That Turned $10,000 Into at Least $3.68 Million;2/13/2017;"The dream of every investor is to purchase the nextAppleorJohnson & Johnsonas a small-cap stock and watch it bloom into one of the leading   companies within its industry. But companies that have the   ability and opportunity to grow their valuations from the   millions into megacap territory are quite rare.Furthermore, even when investors find one of these profit   powerhouses, they often have a hard time sitting still for the   long period of time required to let their investment thesis fully   pan out. Information is now constantly at our fingertips, and   with the rise of the internet and trading algorithms, holding   time frames have seemingly been on the decline for years.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();However, there are a select few companies that have turned   modest nest eggs into veritable treasure chests over the past 30   years or so. Had you invested $10,000 in any of the following   three companies in May 1986, you'd have at least $3.68 million   today. Best of all, one of them is a company I can almost   guarantee you've never heard of before.Balchem36,784% return, equating to $3.68 million from a $10,000       investment.If I asked for a show of hands to see how many investors had   heard ofBalchem(NASDAQ: BCPC) before, chances are, not too many hands would be   raised. Balchem, which is still just a midcap company today even   after its 36,784% romp higher, provides animal nutrition   products, food flavorings, and specialty ingredients to the   industrial and pharmaceutical industry.What has allowed Balchem to thrive isn't so much its business   diversity as its innovation (and a little bit of luck). As the   story wastold byThe Wall Street Journallast year, Balchem was nearing a point of reckoning in the   mid-to-late 1990s, when it was losing money hand-over-fist on a   new nutrient coating. Thankfully, management and Balchem workers   were able to double production without raising costs, and found   ancillary revenue channels for existing products.Image source: Balchem.An example the article gave was choline salts, which are   traditionally developed for food supplement purposes. A staff   engineer at Balchem realized that choline salts could also   stabilize clay deposits. That eventually opened a new revenue   channel for the company, as fracking for oil and gas requires the   stabilization of clay deposits. Interestingly, though, fracking   didn't become a major technology in the energy sector until years   after the engineer's discovery. These innovative pursuits have   expanded Balchem's product portfolio organically, allowing it to   wildly outpace theS&P 500.Today, Balchem looks to be fairly valued, if not a bit pricey;   but I guess that's to be expected after a nearly 37,000% run!   Valued at 31 times next year's estimated profit per share,   Balchem would have to produce a major surge in animal and human   nutrition and health sales to reasonably support a higher   valuation.Monster Beverage50,843% return, equating to $5.09 million from a $10,000       investment.Innovation was also the driving force forMonster Beverage(NASDAQ: MNST) , which has delivered nearly 51,000% gains since   May 1986. Monster's claim to fame are its energy drinks, which   have only grown in popularity over the years with young   adults.Over the past 12 months, Monster has generated nearly $3   billion in revenue, practically all of which was tied to its   namesake brand of energy drinks. By comparison, in 2006, it   generated only $606 million in full-year sales. This isn't to say   the company hasn't had its hiccups. In 2012, Monster was the   subject of a Food and Drug Administration investigation into the   deaths of five people who'd consumed its energy drinks, which   quelled sales for a short period. However, as you can clearly see   based on its latest sales numbers, those health safety issues   have been put in the rear view mirror.Image source: Monster Energy.In recent years, Monster's biggest catalyst has been a   partnership withCoca-Cola(NYSE: KO) . Under the agreement, Coca-Cola agreed to contribute   its energy drink portfolio to Monster, and Monster in turn sent   its non-energy product portfolio to Coca-Cola. The deal also   allowed Coca-Cola to take a 16.7% equity investment in Monster   Beverage, giving it access to the fast-growing energy drink   market. Finally, distribution agreements between the two   companies were amended, and since 2014 Monster's gross margin has   leaped from 54.4% to 62.8% on a trailing 12-month basis. The   result was a better-than-doubling of its net income over the past   three years for Monster.Monster Beverage isn't cheap after its run higher -- its   shares now sell for 30 times forward earnings -- but unlike   Balchem, it has the potential for double-digit percentage sales   and profit growth for years to come. Though I'd expect the gains   to be substantially more modest, Monster remains an intriguing   investment opportunity.Microsoft64,633% return, equating to $6.47 million from a $10,000       investment.Last, but not least, we have the operating system kingpin,Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) , which has generated a better than 64,600% return   over the past 30 years and change.It's certainly not hard to understand why Microsoft has been   so dominant. Despite numerous efforts during the emergence of   desktop and laptop computers to unseat it as the dominant   operating system provider, Microsoft dug in and ceded very   little, if any, market share. Today, Microsoft's Windows OS is so   dominant in the PC market, it's almost frightening.Image source: Microsoft.According to NetMarketShare.com, as of January 2017, Windows 7   and Windows 10 combined accounted for 72.5% of all desktop   operating systems. Group the less-popular XP, 8.1, 8, Vista, and   NT together, and they kick in nearly another 19%. That gives   Microsoft a desktop OS market share of about 91.5%, and as you   might have surmised -- correctly -- a lot of pricing power comes   with a veritable monopoly on desktop operating systems.But Microsoft hasn't been without its faults. Its Achilles'   heel, perhaps, has been its acquisitions; its big purchases have   included some notable duds throughout the years. For example,   Microsoft's acquisition ofNokia's handset business and aQuantive were both disasters. Its   $8.5 billion acquisition of Skype has netted the network a lot of   customer usage, but very little in the way of financial   benefits.Nonetheless, Microsoft remains a dominant force in PC   operating systems, is regularly generating $23 billion to $26   billion in annual free cash flow thanks to its substantial   operating margin, and recently acquired LinkedIn, which will   hopefully open new channels of revenue for the company. With   annual EPS growth throughout the remainder of the decade forecast   to be roughly 10%, Microsoft may still offer modest upside to   patient investors.10 stocks we like better than MicrosoftWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock Can Double Your Money;2/13/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) has been a premier tech giant for decades. Sure, it has had its fair share of flubs - many people still cringe at the failure that was the Zune - but overall, management is solid, and MSFT stock isn't too dependent on any one individual.makeArticleAd();Source:Johannes Marliem Via FlickrBill Gates has created a diversified cash cow system that diffuses impacts of potential errors.Technically, the daily short-term chart suggests that more upside in MSFT stock price is likely. But I have to acknowledge that the longer-term weekly chart is more pessimistic than the daily chart.Click to EnlargeSo the theme for today's trade idea? ""Don't overstay your welcome.""How to Trade MSFT Stock HereThe bet:Buy the Mar $65/$67.50 debit call spread for 60 cents per contract to open. This is the maximum I can lose.The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for 2017: The Experts' PicksBuying a spread near the money always statistically carries a coin-flip odds structure for winning. But on the flip side (pun intended), as soon as Microsoft stock rallies, I start gaining. Furthermore, if the rally retests recent highs, I stand to double my money.To mitigate my risk, I can sell downside premium against MSFT stock to lower my out-of-pocket expense. I only do this in stocks that I believe have a solid base that most buyers would be willing to buy on dips.The hedge (optional):Sell the MSFT Oct $52.50 put for $1.10 to open.By selling a naked put, I commit to buying Microsoft stock at the sold strike. Statistically, the 18% buffer from current price gives me a 90% theoretical chance of success. If MSFT stock falls through my strike sold before mid-October, I would be put the stock at $52.50 per share. If so, anything below $51.40 would accrue losses for me.I can restructure the hedge trade to better suit more conservative traders.The twist (optional):Sell the MSFT Oct $55/$52.50 credit put spread. This is also a bullish trade for which I collect 45 cents per contract to open. This has a slightly smaller buffer from current price but not too aggressively so. If successful, this trade would yield 20% on money risked.If the MSFT stock price stays above my sold put strikes, then any premium I recapture by selling the debit calls spread would be pure profit. This means I don't need Microsoft to rally for me to profit. I simply need it to stay above my sold downside risk.Why Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Holders Shouldn't Sweat SnapchatI am not required to hold my Microsoft options open through expiration. I can close any of them for partial gains or losses at any time.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director ofSellSpreads.com.

Console Wars 2017: Will Sony or Microsoft Win?;2/10/2017;"Sony PlayStation controller. Image source: Pixabay.Sony(NYSE: SNE) andMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) have been battling each other in the gaming   industry for 16 years. Gaming is far more important to the   livelihood of Sony than Microsoft, and therefore the stakes are   much higher for Sony.makeArticleAd();The console war between Sony's PlayStation (PS) and   Microsoft's Xbox has grown more heated with time. The first round   was no contest. Sony's PS2 -- launched in 2000 -- outsold the   original Xbox by more than 100 million units. In the next cycle,   the PS3 barely edged out the Xbox 360. So far in the current   cycle, Sony's PS4 has dominated, selling over 50 million units   compared to Microsoft Xbox One's 28 million.But Microsoft is planning a major counterattackThings started going Microsoft's way in 2016, when Xbox One   began to outsell PS4. To a degree, this may stem from some games   receiving higher ratings on Xbox One than PS4.However, Microsoft's momentum was halted in its tracks in the   fall when Sony released two new versions of its console -- the   PS4 Slim and PS4 Pro. The Slim is cheaper than the launch version   and is more compact, while the PS4 Pro features enhanced   processing power in order to display games in 4K resolution.The console landscape will change again later this year when   Microsoft launches a new console codenamed ""Scorpio."" Reports   show Scorpio's technology to be far superior to PS4 Pro. A   developer for some Microsoft exclusive games has even claimed   that Scorpio is not an intermediate upgrade like Sony's console   and instead Scorpio is taking a much bigger leap and is a   full-blown, next-generation console.How can Sony defend its lead?Typically, there is not much that differentiates competing   consoles. If you set up a PS4 and Xbox One on two TVs side by   side, you would be hard pressed to notice a difference while   viewing the same game.The way console makers differentiate themselves is mainly   through exclusive first-party games. Arguably the three best   franchises that are exclusive to Microsoft's Xbox areHalo,Forza, andGears of War. However, Sony's exclusive game portfolio is generally   considered more attractive than Microsoft's; this is possibly   partly why Microsoft's Xbox has never managed to outsell   PlayStation through an entire cycle.A console is a hit or flop based on the breadth of quality   games available for it. With this in mind, there are several   titles Sony has in development for release in 2017 that could   keep gamers choosing PlayStation over Xbox.Three in particular areHorizon Zero Dawn,Gran Turismo Sport, and a new installment in the popularUnchartedseries. There's a long list of others, but these three games   could each be contenders for Game of the Year.In contrast, Microsoft doesn't have anything in its arsenal to   match this lineup. In fact, one of Microsoft's most anticipated   exclusive games in development was recently canceled. It might   have been better planning to releaseGears of War 4(released this past fall) in fall 2017 to give Microsoft a   quality exclusive game to show off Scorpio's graphical prowess.   In the end, I wouldn't put it past Sony to discount the PS4 Pro   around the time of Scorpio's launch.So this begs the question: What kind of financial impact can a   hit game provide Sony?Let's take a look atUncharted 4, a Sony exclusive, which was released in May 2016 and was one of   the year's top-rated games. For the quarter it was released,Unchartedhelped Sony's gaming segment drive year-over-year revenue growth   of 14.5%, and operating income more than doubled to 44 billion   Japanese yen.This isn't to say that the games releasing this year will each   turn out likeUncharted 4. We can't know for certain how well each game will sell. But   Sony appears to have several exclusive titles scheduled for 2017   that are designed to sell more PlayStations and provide a buffer   against the invasion from Microsoft's Project Scorpio.Gaming is in Sony's DNAWith other Sony divisions struggling, Sony is highly dependent   on its PlayStation business. It's crucial that Sony invest in a   steady stream of high-quality exclusive games, and this involves   high risk. To a great extent, Sony's past success at beating   Microsoft, in both game development and console sales, can be   explained by Sony's dependence on gaming.Therefore, my bet is Sony will hold its own in the ongoing   console wars.10 stocks we like better than SonyWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

The Next iPhone Wants to Look Into Your Eyes;2/10/2017;"Expectations for the 2017 iPhone are running high, given the   fact that it will be the 10th-generation ofApple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) most important product. As always, a steady   stream of supply-chain leaks are stoking speculation as to what   features the Mac maker may or may not include. The most expensive   feature-packed model may even set customers backover $1,000. Today's rumor comes from the notoriously hit-or-missDigiTimes, which says that in addition to an OLED display and wireless   charging, the device will also include iris-scanning   technology.A boulder of saltAs always, investors should treat any and all iPhone rumors   with a healthy bit of skepticism. That's especially true since   we've heard similar reports before. Apple first started exploring   iris-scanning technology back in 2014, andDigiTimessaid in July 2016 that the iris-scanning feature wouldn't be   included until the 2018 iPhone. A month later, the same outlet   said 2017 would be the year Apple would debut the technology   after placing orders for iris-recognition chips with Taiwan-based   Xintec.Separately, there are conflicting reports that Apple may   instead prefer to use some type of facial recognition system, as   Apple has filed numerous patents around bio-recognition   methods.makeArticleAd();Biometrics are all the rage right nowIt makes sense that Apple is exploring iris-recognition   technology; what's less clear is the timing of when Apple will   pull the trigger. Iris recognition would be a strong complement   to Touch ID, adding another layer of biometric security. Iris   scanning is even more secure than fingerprint scanning since it's   harder to fake. You may remember when researchers cracked Touch   ID shortly after the feature's launch in 2013, although it still   stands that Touch ID is still vastly superior to alpha-numeric   passwords.Imagine Apple Pay using iris recognition. Image source:     Apple.Beyond logging in, it's also easy to imagine how Apple may   wish to add another layer of biometric security to Apple Pay,   making the company's mobile payment service even more secure.Everybody's doing itThis is an area rivals have already been exploring.Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) included an iris scanner and Windows Hello,   Microsoft's biometric login functionality, in 2015's Lumia 950   and 950 XL. The software giant has yet to bring iris recognition   to other Windows Hello-enabled devices, although many Windows 10   PCs can use facial recognition technology.Samsung's Galaxy Note 7 from last year also included an iris scanner,   which in addition to its propensity to spontaneously combust was   a differentiating feature from Samsung's other flagship devices   from 2016 like the Galaxy S7 or S7 Edge. While the South Korean   company's initial efforts to popularize iris-scanning technology   went down in literal flames, the forthcoming Galaxy S8 is   expected to feature an iris scanner. Samsung also launches its   Galaxy flagships in the spring, and the S8 is expected to be   unveiled in March ahead of an April launch.Apple cares little about being the first -- it just wants to   be the best. If it can implement iris scanning in a more seamless   and integrated way than rivals, it could accelerate the   popularization of biometric security better than anyone else.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

4 Technology Stocks Well Poised to Beat Earnings Estimates;2/10/2017;"The fourth-quarter earnings season has been reasonably well for 13 out of 16 Zacks categorized sectors, with overall earnings up +5.8% from the same period last year on +4.5% higher revenues. As per the latest ZacksEarnings Outlook, this growth rate is much better than +2.8% earnings growth on +2.0% revenue growth for this same group of companies in the third quarter.makeArticleAd();Notably, 319 S&P 500 members (76.3% of the index's total membership) have already reported their results. Of this, 69.6% stocks have beat earnings estimates and 54.5% have come ahead of revenue expectations. However, positive surprises are tracking below the 75.5% and 58.9% earnings and revenue beat percentages for this same group of companies in the preceding quarter, respectively.Overall, earnings are now anticipated to grow +7.3% on +3.9% higher revenues on a year-over-year basis. The anticipated figures mark a solid improvement over the third quarter earnings growth of 3.7% on the back of 2.2% higher revenues. Moreover, the earnings growth figure is the highest since the fourth quarter of 2014.Technology: A Standout Sector in Q4Technology has been one of the standout sectors in the fourth quarter. Almost 86.1% of the sector's total market capitalization has already reported. Total earnings for these companies are up +7.8% from the same period last year on +6.0% higher revenues, with 70.5% beating EPS estimates and 75% beating revenue estimates.The strong growth reflected solid performance from industry giants like Intel Corp,Microsoft(MSFT) andAlphabet(GOOGL). Contrary to the third quarter,Apple's(AAPL) big earnings beat also helped results this time.The rapid adoption of cloud was the common growth factor for these companies. Additionally, growing acceptance of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, personal assistants and Internet of Things (IoT) drove overall results.We believe the rapid adoption of cloud-based technologies will be the key catalyst going ahead. Per IDC, IT spending on cloud infrastructure - servers, enterprise storage, and Ethernet switches for the enterprise private cloud and co-location services - will increase 18.2% in 2017 to $44.2 billion. The growth rate is particularly noticeable when compared with spending on traditional IT, which is expected to decline 3.3% in 2017.How to Make the Right Pick?With the existence of a number of industry players, finding the right stocks that have the potential to beat earnings could be a daunting task. Our proprietary methodology, however, makes it fairly simple for you.

It provides the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Our research shows that for stocks with this combination, the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70%.Our ChoicesGiven below are four technology providers that have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Applied Optoelectronics Inc.(AAOI) - Sugar Land, TX-based Applied Optoelectronics designs, develops and manufactures advanced optical devices, packaged optical components, optical subsystems, laser transmitters and fiber optic transceivers.We note that the company has beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two out of preceding four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 106.74%.The company is expected to report fourth-quarter 2016 results on Feb 23.

SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY): The Quick Guide to SPY;2/10/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe U.S. exchange-traded fund (ETF) business is more than two decades old, and there are currently more than 2,000 exchange-traded products listed in U.S. But even with the industry's exponential growth, the king of U.S. ETFs remains theSPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust(NYSEARCA:SPY).makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');In recent years,ETFshave become an important part of everyday trading on U.S. exchanges, with some well-known funds seeing turnover rise to the point that many of the most heavily traded securities in the U.S. are ETFs.The SPY ETF embodies the rising importance of these funds, as highlighted by average daily volume of over 84 million shares. By comparison,Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) - the largest holding in traditional cap-weighted S&P 500 ETFs like SPY - has average daily turnover of about 31.3 million shares.SPY's popularity among institutional investors and traders helps bolster the ETF's liquidity. In fact, traders of all stripes should not expect to see the S&P 500 ETF's bid/ask spread deviate beyond a penny. For example, SPDR's S&P 500 tracker currently trades around $229 per share, so investors should expect their brokers to quote $229.01 on the offer and $229 on the bid.About the SPY ETFAs its name implies, SPY tracks the S&P 500, which is probably the most widely equity index in the world. SPY's primary competitors are theiShares Core S&P 500 ETF(NYSEARCA:IVV) and theVanguard S&P 500 ETF(NYSEARCA:VOO), both of which feature lower expense ratios than SPY. The SPDR S&P 500 charges 0.0945% per year, or about $9.45 on a $10,000 stake. IVV charges just 0.04% a year.The 10 Best Low-Cost Index Funds to Buy NowSPY's holdings are weighted by market value, meaning the U.S. company with the biggest market capitalization will be the ETF's largest holding and so on down the line. Apple isSPY's top holdingfollowed byMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT). Technology is the largest sector allocation in the S&P 500 at 21.4% followed by financial services at 14.5%.Underscoring the importance of technology stocks to the SPY ETF and the U.S. equity market in general, the weights of consumer staples, energy, materials and utilities, the S&P 500's sixth through ninth sector weights, would need to be combined to arrive at a number larger than technology's weight.Another important note about SPY is its structure. While it is commonly referred to as an ETF, this fund actually is structured as a unit investment trust (UIT). An advantage of the UIT structure for SPY is that it limits tracking error, or how much the fund deviates from the performance of the S&P 500. The primary disadvantage is that itsdividends cannot be reinvestedas they can be in IVV or VOO.As of this writing, Todd Shriber was long VOO.More From InvestorPlaceThe 10 Best ETFs on the PlanetThe 7 Most Popular Vanguard Funds for 401k PlansThe postSPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY): The Quick Guide to SPYappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Why General Electric Company (GE) Stock Is Strictly for Yield;2/10/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAfter holding shares ofGeneral Electric Company(NYSE:GE) for several years,I sold my position and wrote about it,on Jan 11., at $31.41 per share. GE stock opened Feb 10. at $29.65.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockAround here we call that a win.General Electric is like a baseball team that is always predicted to win the pennant, but somehow never gets out of the second division. Under Jeff Immelt, it has turned itself inside-out to become much like what it was a century ago, a company that builds big engines to capture fuel and burn it.The move was capped bya deal taking a majority interestinBaker Hughes Incorporated(NYSE:BHI), the oilfield services firm.You will still findGE stock bullshere and bless their heart. General Electric is a great old American company with thousands of employees, and retirees, depending upon it.But I'm done, and unlessyou're really into yield, you should be done, too. Here is why.Leaving GE StockImmelt has been running the company for over 15 years now and GE stock is still trading below where it was when he started. It's also 25% below its 2007 peak.7 Marvelous Mid-Cap Stocks to Buy for the Best of All WorldsAfter years of pounding the table for the stock, Jim Cramer finally threw in the towel this month, saying after an interview with Immelt that if General Electric fails to hit its 2017 targets it will become a ""must not own.""The 2017 goals are modest, organic growth of 3% to 5%. The result would be a nice little yield stock, but one that has no excitement.For all of General Electric's talk about becoming a software company withPredix, its industrial Internet of Things platform, technology remains a very small piece of the business. Even if Predix were to hit its goal of $15 billion in sales for 2020, that would still be barely 10% of the current company.Buying ServiceMax, in November, for $915 million, and consolidating the field service management arena, doesn't change that underlying reality. Linking software and services to sales of big ticket engines doesn't change the fact that the money still comes from the engines.That market is declining, and GE is a big reason why. When you make machines more energy efficient, when you make capital last longer, you eventually slow the replacement cycle. Things aren't broken, why fix them?General Electric isbig in wind power, too, but that doesn't change the fact that the vast majority of the company's energy operations are focused on fossil fuels, especially after the Baker Hughes deal. Immelt has been proclaiming the future while buying the past.The GE Dividend OpportunityThere is an opportunity here, but it is limited to investors seeking income, retirees and those with the patience to watch paint dry.Should Bill Gates Sell His Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock?Under Immelt, General Electric has proven to be a reliable payer of dividends. Over the last five years, for instance, those dividends have increased by nearly 50%, from 17 cents per share to 24 cents. Most years, GE's earnings should clear those dividends rather easily - in 2016, it paid out 93 cents per share to investors while earning $1.This means that the GE dividend is currently yielding 3.24%, against a 10-year bond rate of 2.4% and a 30-year bond rate of 3.02%. If you are seeking retirement income, you get a better deal with General Electric shares, especially if your income is modest (dividends are taxable income) than with U.S. government paper. And GE stock might go up. As referenced earlier, Richard Saintvilus, an InvestorPlace contributor I trust, thinks it may rise 20% this year.If he's right you have a bargain, even before Immelt retires and someone else gets the chance to turn General Electric inside-out again.Dana Blankenhornis a financial and technology journalist.

Apple Inc. a 50% Dividend Grower Hiding in Plain Sight (AAPL);2/10/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThere are two ways to get big dividends: you can buy stocks that boast highcurrentyields, or you can buy stocks that consistently grow their payouts.makeArticleAd();A well-balanced portfolio will include both types of companies, withdividend-growth stocksbeing the cornerstone of a longer-term income strategy.Still, investors sometimes get frustrated with dividend growers because to get their outsized payout growth, you often have to settle for a low current yield. And why buy a risky asset that yields 1% when you can get a long-term Treasury that pays 2%?There are two answers to this question. The first is that Treasuries aren't risk-free. If you buy a 10-year note and interest rates go up, the value of your Treasury will go down. If you need to sell early for some reason, you'll lose money.Secondly, dividend-growth stocks will increase their income over time-something Treasuries will never do. In fact, if you choose thebest dividend growth stocks, you'll see your income skyrocket in a few short years.And the best dividend growth stock is one of the world's most recognizable and popular brands:Apple Inc.(AAPL).If you read about investing in Apple, you almost always see a focus on iPhone sales, the value of future products and so on. Bears note slowing iPhone sales growth (or negative sales growth), devices that didn't quite catch on and rising competition. Bulls counter that Apple has a valuable and unique market position and innovative products that captivate consumers.Both arguments are really missing the point.The main reason to buy Apple is more boring but more important: net income, free cash flow (FCF) and dividends.Let's start with FCF, which is now $9.65 per share, meaning Apple's dividend-payout ratio is a measly 24%. But the really amazing thing is how the company's cash flow has exploded and continues to rise:FCF Boots UpYes, there's been a bit of a dip in the last year, but you can also see that FCF has already bottomed out and is now back on the rise.7 Tech Stocks With Explosive Growth PotentialThe next thing to consider is Apple's operating margin, which is currently 27%. This is important because it means the company is so profitable that it can continue to pay out dividends at the current payout rate. That operating margin has fallen slightly in recent years, partly as a result of changes in the smartphone market, but it's still historically high:Apple Remains a Profit MonsterNote that we've seen Apple's profit margin remain over 25% since 2009. This is great news for investors, but it also means Apple has become a very different company than it was in the 1990s and 2000s. It's no longer a burgeoning tech firm but an enterprise that reliably and consistently produces cash it can distribute to shareholders. In other words, it's a blue chip stock, not a speculative bet.Again, great news for investors-especially those looking for income. Ironically, many dividend-growth investors forget about Apple, or they may allocate a very small part of their portfolios to the company out of fear that it's risky. That's a mistake.In the last five years since Apple started paying dividends, its payout has soared 50.6%:Strong Dividend GrowthIf we compare that to some of the most popular and supposedly ""safer"" dividend payers, we see that Apple's dividend growth is a big outperformer:Apple Trounces the RestAs you can see,General Electric Company(GE), AT&T Inc.(T), Johnson & Johnson(JNJ), Chevron Corporation(CVX), Consolidated Edison, Inc.(ED)andExxon Mobil Corporation(XOM)are all growing their dividends at a slower pace than Apple.The tech giant also has a lower P/E ratio than all of these names (just 15.6, which is 39% lower than the rest of the S&P 500).It's time to think different about Apple; this is a relatively safe dividend stock that is destined to be a Dividend Aristocrat. While headlines about iPhone sales may cause some volatility in the short term, the company's strong cash generation will reward you with big payouts in the long run.Buy Apple Now … Then Add These 6 High YieldersThere's no doubt Apple is a best-in-class dividend-growth stock. But you also need high yields to go with that dividend growth-especially if you're in or near retirement.Should Bill Gates Sell His Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock?That's where the 6 reliable income generators in our new""No-Withdrawal"" retirement portfoliocome in. They throw offrock-solid yields of 6%, 8%, 9% and up.And with an average yield of 8.0%, this portfolio willeasily hand you a $40,000 income stream on a $500,000 nest egg.Each of those payouts is backed byrock-solid balance sheetsandsurging cash flows.Like Apple, these income powerhouses are all cheap now, but I don't expect that to last.These no-drama plays are perfect for 2017, with the market starting to look twitchy after the go-go ""Trump bump."" Don't miss out.Click here and I'll share our 6 top picks for high income and double-digit upside.More From InvestorPlace7 Cheap Stocks to Buy That Could Double in 2017The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for 2017: The Experts' PicksThe postApple Inc. a 50% Dividend Grower Hiding in Plain Sight (AAPL)appeared first onInvestorPlace."

CyberArk (CYBR) Beats Q4 Earnings and Revenue Estimates;2/10/2017;"Keeping its earnings streak alive for the tenth consecutive quarter,CyberArk Software Ltd.CYBRreported better-than-expected fourth-quarter 2016 results. The company reported adjusted earnings per share (excluding amortization of intangible assets and other one-time items but including stock-based compensation) on a proportionate tax basis of 30 cents per share, which came way ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 24 cents per share. Adjusted earnings however were flat year over year.Quarter DetailsCyberArk's revenues grew 25% year over year to $64.4 million and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $63 million. The company's revenues increased on a year-over-year basis, primarily due to better-than-expected demand for its privileged account security platform.Revenues were also boosted by a 23% increase in License revenues, which came in at $40.8 million and accounted for 63% of total revenue. Also, a 28% year-over-year increase in Maintenance and Professional Services revenues (37% of total revenues) positively impacted the quarterly results.Geographically, on a year-over-year basis, revenues from the Americas increased 12% and contributed 58% of total revenue. EMEA increased 53% and accounted for 36% of total revenue. Asia-Pacific and Japan increased 30% year over year, representing 6% of total revenue.CyberArk's adjusted gross margin (excluding amortization of intangible assets and other one-time items but including stock-based compensation) contracted 60 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis to 86.9%, primarily due to higher cost of sales.The company's adjusted operating margin (excluding amortization of intangible assets and other one-time items but including stock-based compensation) shrunk 80 bps from the year-ago quarter to 22.3%, primarily due to lower gross margin and higher adjusted operating expenses as a percentage of revenues. Adjusted operating expenses increased 25.7% year over year to $41.6 million.The company's adjusted net income (excluding amortization of intangible assets and other one-time items buts including stock-based compensation) came in at $11 million, which improved from $10.8 million reported in the year-ago quarter. On a GAAP basis, net income came in at $10.2 million compared with $9.9 million reported in the year-ago period.CyberArk exited the quarter with cash, cash equivalents, short-term deposits and marketable securities of approximately $238.3 million, flat with the previous quarter. Receivables were $20.4 million at the end of the quarter.CyberArk's balance sheet does not have any long-term debt. The company reported cash flow from operations of $59.2 million for 2016.GuidanceThe company provided guidance for the first quarter and full year 2017.For the first quarter, CyberArk expects revenues in a range of $57 million to $58 million (mid-point $57.5 million), representing 22% to 24% year-over-year growth. The mid-point of the guided range is below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $57.95 million. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in a range of $9.9 million to $10.7 million. The company expects non-GAAP earnings for the first quarter in a range of 21 cents to 23 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 13 cents.For the year, the company expects revenues in a range of $267 million to $270 million (mid-point $268.5 million), representing 23% to 25% year-over-year growth. The guided range is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $262.1 million. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in a range of $56 million to $58 million. The company expects non-GAAP earnings for 2017 in a range of $1.20 per share to $1.24 per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 88 cents.Our TakeCyberArk is an Israeli company that specializes in protecting accounts from cyber-attacks. The company offers several products that protect passwords, close loopholes in the security system, and secure cloud-based assets.The company ended 2016 on a strong note as evident from the better-than-expected results for the fourth quarter. While CyberArk's revenues marked a year-over-year improvement, its adjusted earnings were flat.CyberArk Software Ltd. Price, Consensus and EPS     SurpriseCyberArk Software Ltd. Price, Consensus and EPS   Surprise|CyberArk Software Ltd. QuoteShares of the cybersecurity firm fell 4.2% in yesterday's after-hour trade. We believe that the company's decelerating revenue growth rate may be a concern for investors.It should be noted that the company has reported the slowest revenue growth rate in the fourth quarter since it was enlisted in Sep 2014. Prior to this, CyberArk had witnessed over 35% revenue growth every quarter.Moreover, its outlook for the first quarter as well as full year depicts that it will remain in mid 20%. This makes us increasingly cautious about its growth prospects. Intensifying competition from peers such as CA Inc.CAand Microsoft Corp.MSFTand an uncertain macroeconomic environment add to its woes.Currently, CyberArk carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Notably, the stock has underperformed the Zacks categorizedIT Servicesindustry in the past three months. While the industry has gained 6.1% in the said period, CyberArk has lost 0.1% of its value.A better-ranked stock in the IT Services industry is Acxiom CorporationACXMwhich sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

The Death Of The Commercial Database: Oracle's Dilemma;2/10/2017;"BySamadhi Partners:(click to enlarge)Contributing authors:John Freeman,Fred McClimans,Zach Mitchell.____We see the $29.6b commercial database market contracting 20-30% by 2021, and do not believe Oracle (ORCL) can transition its revenue streams (from legacy commercial database to cloud-based subscription offerings) fast enough to offset the decline of this market, which represents a major legacy core of its revenue.makeArticleAd();(click to enlarge)The commercial database market - 80% of which is an oligopoly of Oracle, IBM (IBM), and Microsoft (MSFT) - has remained one of the most stable and sticky in all of tech for over two decades. However, we think the velocity and magnitude of its decline is likely to surprise many investors.(click to enlarge)The deflationary pressures that have already hit the database market are just getting started, including:Migration to SaaS, where most offerings use free open-source   databases;faster growth in use cases such as social media, IoT, and   unstructured/semi-structured data that are ill-suited to the SQL   standard upon which the database oligopoly is based;the increasing stability and functionality of a variety of   free open-source options, most of which are ""Not Only SQL""   (NoSQL) and are therefore much better suited to the   aforementioned use cases; andthe disproportionately large benefits that NoSQL databases   continue to realize as a result of Moore's Law-driven   improvements in processors, memory, solid-state storage, and   network throughput (these improvements increase NoSQL's ability   to handle both NoSQL and SQL use cases on-the-fly and   progressively marginalize SQL-only databases just as SQL-only   databases marginalized mainframe-based databases during the late   '80s and '90s).Revenue from database software represented ~36% of Oracle's total FY16 revenue and ~55% of its operating profit.(click to enlarge)Note: Database Software and On-Premise Applications include   both licenses and maintenance revenue.The company's decline in projected database revenue is distinct from and in addition to the decline in its on-premises application revenue, which accounted for ~25% of total FY16 revenue and ~39% of operating profit.(click to enlarge)Microsoft and IBM will be hurt only marginally, as database software generates just ~5% of revenue for each.Without aggressive action to significantly increase non-database revenue, we do not believe Oracle can offset the oncoming decline in commercial database revenue fast enough to maintain its present valuation.Specifically, we believe Oracle needs an even more radical and rapid organizational and cultural shift toward ""cloud-first"" that incentivizes both its sales force and its customers to move aggressively into the cloud. The company also needs to consolidate its various home-grown and acquired cloud/SaaS offerings toward a single platform in order to generate operational leverage down the road. Both of these initiatives will be painful in several ways, especially financially, for a few years to come. To partially offset the pain, Oracle should divest its remaining hardware and other non-core businesses.(click to enlarge)Source: Morningstar______ThemeExplanationFor those that are interested in a more technical dive, below is a deeper, historical explanation of the five interrelated trends that are gaining momentum, and that will, in combination, cause the commercial-database market to contract 20% to 30% by 2021:1. The Continued Enterprise Migration to SaaS/Cloud.Except for a few of the first SaaS offerings that were built on top of an Oracle database, namely Salesforce.com (CRM), NetSuite (N), and Oracle itself, it is difficult to find a SaaS provider that uses any commercial database. For companies founded after 2005, that number is virtually zero.The vast majority of SaaS providers today either use an open-source database, or, as is the case with SaaS HCM vendor Workday (WDAY), develop their own. Every user of an on-premises enterprise application, including one of the five core client-server application categories: ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning), CRM (Customer Relationship Management), HCM (Human Capital Management), SCM (Supply Chain Management), and BI (Business Intelligence) applications, which moves to SaaS therefore eliminates a commercial database seat, and with it, the maintenance/support and future upgrade revenue it would have generated. Even an enterprise seat that moves to Salesforce.com will generate far less revenue for Oracle than that seat did when it was deployed on-premises.Hence, we believe the enterprise migration to SaaS/cloud is highly deflationary for commercial-database revenue. Further, we are still early in the migration from client-server to SaaS/cloud. Depending on which research one believes, this migration is only 10% to 25% complete and is only just beginning to impact more mission-critical applications - such as ERP - that are more likely to be running on higher-end SQL databases (including those from Oracle and IBM, and to a lesser extent, Microsoft).2. Commercial SQL Databases are Not Well-Suited to Handle the Most Compelling Emerging Use Cases.After SQL was standardized in 1987, it went unchallenged for over 20 years in defining how data was organized, searched, and sorted. However, in the mid-2000s, colossal tech companies began running into the limitations of SQL databases in handling both the sheer volume and varying structure (or lack thereof) of the data that they wanted to preserve, navigate, analyze, and serve up on-demand to their users/customers.Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG) (GOOGL), LinkedIn (LNKD), and Facebook (FB) each solved its own scaling problems by developing and implementing its own database software that broke with the constraints of the SQL standard.What's more, each company released open-source versions of its databases shortly after. Dozens of new open-source databases were consequently produced in 2008 and 2009, leading to what Guy Harrison - the author of Next Generation Databases - termed ""a sort of Cambrian explosion."" As a result of their departure from SQL, these databases all fell under the term ""NoSQL"" - even though most were as different from each other as they were from SQL.Given the exponential growth in the volume and variety of data - driven by richer social media content, more social media users, and an explosion of autonomously captured IoT data - and given the increasing desire for analysis on captured data, we believe the number of use cases suited to NoSQL will soon far exceed those suited to SQL.The rise of these new use cases will drive greater adoption by large enterprises of open-source NoSQL solutions at the expense of commercial SQL databases.3. NoSQL Databases and Schema-on-Read Processes Are on the Right Side of Moore's Law;SQL and Schema-on-Write Are on the Wrong Side. In general, NoSQL databases are substantially more processor, memory, and storage intensive than SQL databases, even after considering the fact that they relax many of the constraints that SQL places on how data is organized. Though NoSQL database architectures existed well before 2005 - at least, in theory - there was simply not enough processing power, memory capacity, and storage space for them to be put to practical use outside of academia.During the comparatively processor/memory/bandwidth-starved 1980s and 1990s, adherence to the more-rigid SQL standard was effectively compulsory to ensure the performance and reliability that enterprises needed in order to migrate their applications, especially those more mission-critical applications, from mainframes and minis to the more-distributed and network-dependent client-server architecture.The price paid for SQL's acceptable performance and reliability was driven by:The overall inflexibility of the data structure, called a   schema;the onerous requirement to define that structure prior to the   deployment of the database and its associated applications;the difficulty in changing that structure over time in order   to capture different kinds of data, and to better reflect changes   in the structure of the data and in the organization of the   enterprise; andthe requirement for a schema-on-write process, which fits   data into the schema as it is inputted, as opposed to   schema-on-read, which is simply dumping data into a big   ""container"" and organizing it later into a schema.Over time, however, Moore's Law-driven improvements in processing power, memory capacity and speed, storage capacity and speed, and network throughput have made the rigidity of the SQL standard and the requirement for schema-on-write processes increasingly less necessary and will continue to do so. Hence, with every Moore's Law cycle, SQL and its resource-efficient schema-on-write process loses its competitive advantage, while NoSQL, with its relatively resource-inefficient but much more flexible schema-on-write process, becomes increasingly free from the constraints that prevented it from being adopted in the first place.4. In-Mem Possibilities and the Elimination of HDD Compromises. When SQL was standardized, hard disk drives (HDDs) were the only cost-effective storage medium that could be accessed in real time. Therefore, much of the fundamental code written into SQL database software is designed to accommodate the shortcomings of HDDs, such as the slow speed with which they can read and transmit requested data into memory and their relatively higher failure rates - at least, compared to the major solid state components of a system such as the CPU, memory, and network throughput. Now that SSDs are rapidly becoming a cost-effective replacement for HDDs, much of the design and certainly much of the code of legacy SQL database software that made such compromises in order to accommodate comparatively much slower HDDs is now rendered unnecessary.In contrast, many NoSQL databases are written so as to take maximum advantage of SSD storage and will likely be updated to take advantage of even faster-emerging non-volatile memory technologies such as Intel (INTC)/Micron's (MU) 3D xPoint, which is just now becoming commercially available. We believe that, given the strong requirement to maintain compliance with the SQL standard and maintain their own backward compatibility, SQL database vendors will not be able to optimize their code for SSDs nearly as fast as many of the open source projects will be able to, putting them further at a competitive disadvantage - a classic example of Clayton Christensen's ""The innovator's dilemma"".5. Increasing Availability of ""SQL Methadone"" Solutions for Weaning Enterprises Off Expensive Commercial Databases. We are seeing an increasing number of software tools and services designed to help enterprises migrate from commercial SQL databases. Even the most mission-critical applications running on an Oracle or IBM database can be increasingly surrounded, ""quarantined"", and dismantled over time, much like what happened to many of the legacy mainframe applications during the shift to the client-server architecture in the 1990s.While SQL databases from the likes of Oracle, IBM, and MSFT will survive in some enterprises for many more years - again, much like mainframes - they will be increasingly marginalized and cost-reduced as much as possible. We see many of these tools maturing already within the Hadoop ecosystem, which already has multiple ways to integrate with SQL databases and/or put SQL interfaces and querying ability on NoSQL databases. In our opinion, this is a very similar development to the early-1990s emergence of multiple ways to integrate mainframe applications with PCs and client-server applications.______To subscribe to the Samadhi Brief newsletter, please visit SamadhiPartners.com.

Genpact Limited (G) Stock Has Room to Grow;2/10/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsGenpact Limited(NYSE:G) stands for ""generating business impact"" and began as a business unit withinGeneral Electric Company(NYSE:GE) two decades ago. Unfortunately, over the last year or so, Genpact hasn't generated much shareholder impact, despite that catchy slogan. G stock is up around 3.5% just over a month into the new year, but is nearly that same amount in the red if we zoom out to the past 12 months.makeArticleAd();Still, I believe Genpact is about to start a more substantial recovery. Itsearningscall this morning - including an earnings beat and a slight miss on revenue - could be the beginning of a run that could tally up double-digit gains for 2017.More specifically, Genpact is a business-to-business company which hangs its hat on efficiency. The company offers digital solutions related to payments, processing services, risk and compliance, customer and channel management, and business insights and optimization. And it boasts 75,000 employees in 25 countries.For the fourth quarter, G stock posted earnings growth of 21%, while its full-year earnings growth was around 16%. That's solid considering Genpact is facing difficult currency exchange.Genpact Stock a Good DealBut despite those headwinds, Genpact still offers great deal for shareholders, as stock has a trailing price-to-earnings ratio of 21, which is well below the industry average of 35, and a forward P/E of just 16. This latest earnings beat wasn't a surprise either, as Genpact has posted an earnings beat in each of the last four quarters as well.7 Marvelous Mid-Cap Stocks to Buy for the Best of All WorldsThe previous quarter represented the smallest beat thanks in part to lower technology spending in the investment banking and healthcare markets. But it wasn't too bad: non-GAAP earnings still grew 9% year over year to36 cents- 3 cents better than Wall Street hoped.Plus, a recent acquisition by Genpact could fuel more growth down the line. The company just reached an agreement to acquire an Australian arm ofFiserv Inc(NASDAQ:FISV), which serves three of the four major retail banks in Australia, handling approximately 70% of all checks processed in the Australian market, according to the press release.Looking forward a bit further, Genpact's earnings are expected to maintain a double-digit average over the next five years, smoothing out right around 12%. That's almost double the average of the last five years, when Genpact stock still managed average gains of almost 7%.Add it up, and I like the moves Genpact is making and I like the estimates on tap. Efficiency is never going to go out of style across industries. Even if discretionary spending on B2B tech has been soft in spots of late, I like the prospects for the near-term and believe Genpact stock has some immediate value to realize.I expect investors to realize that now that the latest earnings report has come out, and recommend a buy before Genpact gets its post-earnings pop.Hilary Kramer is the editor ofGameChangers,Breakout Stocks,High Octane Trader,Absolute Capital ReturnandValue Authority.

Should Bill Gates Sell His Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock?;2/10/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIn late December, I made apredictionthatMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) stock would hit $80 in 2017. In reality, it was less a prediction than my agreement with Piper Jaffray analyst Alex Zukin's 12-month price target for MSFT stock of $80.makeArticleAd();Source:Via MicrosoftMore than one month into the year and the Microsoft stock price has a long way to go to reach this lofty goal.It's fair to say that if MSFT stock is going to hit $80, Microsoft's burgeoning cloud business - an annualized revenue run rate of $14.0 billion as of Q2 2017 - needs to deliver more growth over the next three quarters (April, July and October earnings announcements) to justify to investors a forward2018price-to-earnings ratio of 24.5.As I said in my earlier article, I think MSFT can deliver on this front.But it got me thinking about Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, the world's richest person at $85 billion and the owner of approximately 179 million shares of MSFT stock, a number that's been dwindling by approximately80 millionper year over the past decade or so; the proceeds going to fund the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.If this pace continues Bill Gates will have reduced his Microsoft stake to zero by sometime in 2019.Should Bill Gates Sell His MSFT Stock?No, I'm not talking about whether he should continue to fund his foundation - of course, he should -I'm merely wondering if there wasn't a better stock to sell to fund the foundation's good works.10 Super-Safe Dividend Growth Stocks to Buy TodayA quicklookat the financial statements for the foundation's 2015 and 2014 fiscal years shows that $11.3 billion was spent over the course of two years to fund its programs around the world, an average of $5.65 billion per year, about the same amount that Gates would currently generate from the sale of 80 million shares of Microsoft stock.So, from a financial planning standpoint, the 80 million figure makes a whole lot of sense.The holdings of the trust that oversees the investments and cash donated by the Gates's along with Warren Buffett for use by the foundation had a value of $18.5 billion as of September 30, 2016; more than half (57.8%) of the portfolio invested inBerkshire Hathaway Inc.(NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B) Class B stock.Since August 24, 2006 through July 2015, Buffett has donated 200.6 million shares of Class B Berkshire Hathaway shares to the foundation; this past year, Buffett donated roughly15 millionshares. The remaining 285 million shares he agreed to donate back in June 2006 will be doled out at a rate of 5% per year until all 500 million shares are in the hands of the foundation sometime around 2036.So, the choice comes down to whether it makes sense to sell the shares of Microsoft for cash to fund the foundation's work and continue to hold the Berkshire Hathaway shares as an investment or the other way around.The Gates have chosen the former rather than the latter.Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) Stock Is More Valuable Than You ThinkOn the surface, that would seem to be a mistake given MSFT stock has outperformed Berkshire Hathaway Class B stock by 269 basis points on annuallized basis over the last five years through Feb. 6.So, with that in mind, does it make sense for Bill Gates to sell his MSFT stock?I don't think he should as some of its best growth lies in the immediate future. But, I also don't think the trust should sell Berkshire Hathaway stock because it provides such good diversification and protection of capital.Both of these stocks are worth owning for the long haul.If it were up to me, I'd probably look at cashing in some of the trust's other holdings first, but thankfully for all those around the world deserving of the good education and healthcare the foundation looks to fund, it's not up to me.As of this writing, Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceThe Top 10 Dow Dividend Stocks for February7 Tech Stocks That Are Bucking the DowntrendThe postShould Bill Gates Sell His Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock?appeared first onInvestorPlace."

Why I’m Raising My Price Target On Microsoft Corporation Stock (MSFT);2/10/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIf you thinkMicrosoft Corporation(MSFT) shares are expensive now, they are about to get even more so.makeArticleAd();Back in December,I issueda 12-month piece target of $72 per share. But following the company's breathtaking fiscal second-quarter earnings results, I am now confident is too cheap.As such I'm raising my price target by $8 per share to $80 per share.Why the price increase? For starters, Microsoft stock is currently priced at a forward P/E of just 21 based on fiscal 2017 estimates of $2.97 per share. And while that P/E is two points above the average stock in the S&P 500 index, Microsoft's recent moves suggests it deserves a much higher multiple.With growth opportunities emerging in the realm of the cloud, Internet-of-Things, smart home and a host of other areas thanks to its recent acquisitions, Microsoft stock still looks like a bargain. I'll get back to this in a moment. But let's first assess its recent earnings.The main question heading into 2017 was to what extent Microsoft could sustain the strong cloud momentum it used in 2016 to surpassAmazon.com, Inc.(AMZN).Microsoft answered that question with authority. In three months that ended December, the company earned $5.2 billion, or 66 cents per share, rising from $5.02 billion a year earlier. On an adjusted basis, when taking out one-time gains and costs, earnings came to 84 cents per share, which beat the consensus estimate of 79 cents per share. Second-quarter revenue came in at $24.1 billion, while adjusted revenue was $26.1 billion, also topping Wall Street estimates.The company's aggressive move towards the cloud was the main driver of the strong top- and bottom-line beat. Not only does this lessen Microsoft's reliance on declining PC sales, but cloud businesses also generate higher margins. Revenue from the Office 365 business grew almost 50% year-over-year, while gross margins in its commercial cloud business, which includes Azure and Office 365 products sold to businesses, reached 48% during the quarter - up two percentage points year-over-year.7 Tech Stocks With Explosive Growth Potential""Our customers are seeing greater value and opportunity as we partner with them through their digital transformation,"" said CEO Satya Nadella in a statement. ""Accelerating advancements in AI across our platforms and services will provide further opportunity to drive growth in the Microsoft Cloud.""Azure revenue surged 93% year-over-year (up 95% in constant currency) during the quarter. Though Microsoft provided no specific dollar amount to help break down the cloud revenue, Bernstein analysts Mark Mordler estimates Azure now generates some 20% of commercial cloud revenue, which Microsoft said was generating an ""annualized run rate"" just north of $14 billion, according to Barron's. This means Azure now generates quarterly revenue at around $3 billion.Between now and 2020, worldwide spending on public cloud services is expected to soar to more than $195 billion. This is double the revenue the industry is expected to generate by the end of 2016, according to a research firm IDC.""Cloud software will significantly outpace traditional software product delivery over the next five years, growing nearly three times faster than the software market as a whole and becoming the significant growth driver to all functional software markets,"" said Benjamin McGrath, senior research analyst, SaaS and Business Models. ""By 2020, about half of all new business software purchases will be of service-enabled software, and cloud software will constitute more than a quarter of all software sold.""IDC is not alone in this prediction. Pacific Crest analyst Brent Bracelin forecasts public cloud spending, currently around $58 billion annually, will triple to $205 billion in the next three years. During that span, Bracelin sees spending on SaaS services to surge 20% annually, reaching $129 billion by 2020.As Microsoft's cloud business takes up greater portions of its total revenue, Microsoft stands to secure larger pieces of the cloud pie. And Microsoft, which during the second quarter completed its blockbuster $26.2 billion acquisition of LinkedIn, now has even more ways to attract businesses to Azure. To that end, Microsoft stock should command a higher P/E of 4 to 6 points above its current valuation.When applying a P/E of just 25 to fiscal 2018 estimates of $3.26 per share, this puts the stock's fair value at around $80. That valuation is still more than half that of Amazon, which relies on its AWS cloud platform for the bulk of its profits. And with almost $121 billion in cash on its balance sheet make more deals for growth in key areas, Microsoft, which also pays a 2.45% annual dividend yield, is a stock to own and forget about.Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) Stock Is More Valuable Than You ThinkRisks To Consider:Much of my optimism is based on the assumption that Microsoft can continue to increase cloud market share and successfully integrate LinkedIn.Action To Take:Microsoft should be kept on the watchlist of investors who are looking for a company with upside potential that pays a reliable dividend.Editor's Note:All Wall Street firms closely-guard theirblack box trading systemsto gain an edge over their competition.

Don't Overlook These 6 Incredible Amazon.com Numbers;2/9/2017;"Shares ofAmazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) fell more than 3% on Feb. 3 after the tech giant   posted mixed fourth quarter earnings and  soft guidance for   the first quarter. Revenue rose 22% annually to $43.7 billion,   but that  missed expectations by $980 million. The company   was hit hard by currency headwinds, which reduced its top line by   about $558 million. Amazon's closely watched AWS (Amazon Web   Services) revenue rose 47% annually to $3.54 billion, but that   also missed expectations of $3.6 billion and represented a   slowdown from 55% growth in the third quarter.For the first quarter, Amazon expects 14.1% to 22.7%   year-over-year sales growth, which missed analyst forecasts for   23.4% growth. But on a currency neutral basis, which excludes an   expected currency impact of $730 million, Amazon expects its   revenue to rise 17% to 25%.Image source: Amazon.makeArticleAd();Some negative reports about Amazon focused on those headline   numbers, but they glossed over many of the positive growth   figures. Let's take a look at six incredible numbers from that   report that investors shouldn't overlook.1. $749 million in net incomeDuring the fourth quarter, Amazon's net income rose 55%   annually to $749 million, or $1.54 per share -- which beat   expectations by $0.19. For the full year, its net income surged   over 300% to $2.4 billion.That incredible growth was mostly attributed to the rapid   growth of AWS' high-margin business, which gives Amazon much more   freedom to expand its e-commerce ecosystem with low-margin   hardware like its Echo speakers, loss-leading services like   Amazon Video and Prime Now, and logistics solutions like new   fulfillment centers and drones.2. AWS' operating margin of 26%AWS finished last quarter with an operating margin of 26%,   compared to 24% in the year-ago quarter. That margin expansion   indicates that AWS' massive scale is offsetting tough price   competition across the cloud platform market, which caused Amazon   and its rivals to reduce their prices throughout the year.3. AWS' annual run rate of $14 billionAmazon announced that AWS had achieved an annual run rate of   $14 billion, indicating that it maintains a commanding lead overMicrosoft's(NASDAQ: MSFT) Azure in the cloud platform race.Microsoft claimed that its ""commercial cloud"" had achieved an   annual run rate of over $14 billion last quarter, but most of   that total came from SaaS platforms like Office 365 and Dynamics   CRM. Azure -- which competes directly against AWS in the   IaaS/PaaS ""cloud platform"" markets -- accounts for a much smaller   percentage.Microsoft doesn't disclose how much revenue Azure generates,   but  combining earlier industry estimates and its reported   growth rate  over the past few quarters indicates that its   annual run rate could be around $3 billion.4. Over 1,000 new AWS featuresAmazon already serves massive customers like NASA, the CDC,   andNetflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) with AWS, but it's continuously widening the   platform's competitive moat against rival platforms like Azure   with new features. Amazon added over  1,000 new features and   services to AWS in fiscal 2016, compared to about 700 in   2015.It also opened eleven new AWS Availability Zones across five   geographic regions in 2016, bringing AWS' total coverage to 42   Availability Zones across 16 regions globally. That massive data   center expansion will help AWS reach more companies and   developers, all while supporting the expansion of its e-commerce   and digital ecosystem into new markets.5. Prime Video in over 200 countriesA big part of that digital ecosystem expansion is Prime Video,   the company's streaming answer to Netflix. Amazon has made the   platform a ""free"" perk for Prime subscribers and a stand-alone   subscription service that costs slightly less than Netflix.Like Netflix, Amazon is investing heavily in original content,   and popular shows likeTransparentandMan in the High Castlehelped it become the third largest video streaming platform in   the U.S. after YouTube and  Netflix last year, according to   research firm Sandvine. Amazon is also following Netflix's lead   and investing heavily in localized original content in key   markets like Japan and India, which could help  expand its   Prime user base worldwide.6. 4,000 new skills for AlexaAmazon also taught its voice recognition platform Alexa 4,000   new skills since last October. It noted that ""tens of thousands   of developers"" are building new skills for the platform -- which   powers the Echo, Kindle, and Fire TV devices -- and that it was   working with ""a lot of major companies"" to integrate their   products with that ecosystem.The expansion of the Alexa ecosystem is important, because it   can give Amazon control of users' connected homes via Dash   buttons, DRS-enabled appliances, and other connected devices. In   addition to boosting its e-commerce revenue with ""frictionless""   orders, that platform can process data through AWS and widen its   moat in the smart home race againstAlphabet's Google, which is trying to establish its own home-based   ecosystem around its Home smart speaker.The key takeawayAmazon's fourth quarter report was lumpy, but investors   shouldn't overlook these positive numbers. Analysts still expect   Amazon's revenue and  earnings to respectively rise 22% and   53% next year -- so its overall growth won't peak anytime soon.   Therefore, I believe that investors should take advantage of   Amazon's temporary swoon and pick up a few more shares for the   long term.10 stocks we like better than MicrosoftWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Voice Control Platforms a Key Technology Trend in 2017;2/9/2017;"Technology companies have spent years on computational linguistics to solve the basic problem of making machines more efficient in an era where they would have to deal with bigger data loads and more complex queries. One of the products of this research is voice driven artificial intelligence that can connect and drive everyday devices to understand human speech and react accordingly.The most basic form of voice technology is a person directing a machine to do routine tasks such as play a track, read the mail, send automated response to mails and such things that Apple'sAAPLSiri, Alphabet'sGOOGLGoogle Now or Microsoft'sMSFTCortana took care of. Home automation is a more recent trend and wouldn't it be cool if most of the smart devices/appliances used in the home can also take voice commands? And sync with each other to decide the desirable activity and then get it done?Amazon AheadWhile Microsoft has many years of research behind it, it is AmazonAMZNthat has really taken voice controlled platforms mainstream. The company launched its first Echo device a couple of years ago and sold more than seven million devices last year. While many of them were the cheaper Dot, it still puts Alexa, Amazon's voice assistant into that many new homes.At this year's CES, Amazon had a coup as companies ranging from FordF, Huawei and LG to a large number of startups unveiled phones, cars, home appliances and other gadgets with Alexa integration making Amazon's voice assistant that much more useful.And Amazon has doubled down to develop Alexa's ""skills,"" which are discrete voice-based applications that allow the system to carry out specific tasks (like ordering pizza for example). At launch, Alexa had just 20 skills, which has reportedly jumped to 5,200 today with the company adding about 100 skills per day.In fact, Bezos has said, ""We've been working behind the scenes for the last four years, we have more than 1,000 people working on Alexa and the Echo ecosystem … It's just the tip of the iceberg.""Just last week, it launched a new website to help brands and developers create more skills for Alexa. It also has a home consultation service called ""simplify your life"" where Amazon reps teach you to automate your home using Echo and Alexa. But all this works simply because everything is connected with AWS, which transmits data between different devices.Amazon.com, Inc. Price and ConsensusAmazon.com, Inc. Price and Consensus|Amazon.com, Inc. QuoteGoogle Has Jumped InAmazon is clearly the leader in voice controlled platforms today, but competition is in hot pursuit. Google Home was launched late last year and the search leader will do all it can to grow market share.To prove the point Google too had some important announcements for the Google Assistant, which drives Google Home. But some of the most important deals were for integrations into Hyundai's navigation system, Chrysler's 300 model, NVIDIA'sNVDAShield TV as well as others such as Belkin smart switches, Switchmate smart lights, Coway Airmega air purifiers, etc. Google still has miles to go before it catches up with Amazon, but it's made a strong start.Google has the most to lose if it can't make it big here because a lot of voice search will probably happen through these assistants going forward. But it also has an advantage, i.e., all the information it has curated over the years, your preferences and your habits that it can draw from to serve you. In short, it knows you better.Alphabet Inc. Price and ConsensusAlphabet Inc. Price and Consensus|Alphabet Inc. QuoteApple Also in the FrayApple doesn't have a separate Home device, but a useful app of the same name that can connect all the smart devices in your home and get them to communicate with each other. So it's also dependent on the number of gadget makers supporting the app and this number has been swelling in the recent past.While Apple's partners aren't making the news as much as the other two, there are a host of switch, light, camera, sensor, security system and other such device makers that have been announcing their support for Apple's platform the last couple of CESs (Apple makes it a point to stay away from the show).Apple Inc. Price and ConsensusApple Inc. Price and Consensus|Apple Inc. QuoteSamsung Taking NoticeSamsung paid a cool $8 billion to acquire auto infotainment, acoustics, display and other systems supplier Harman. That is a big sum to pay, although justified considering that Harman does offer a number of products that would be complementary with the displays and chips that are an important part of the increasingly electronic and soon-to-be self-driving cars. IHS iSuppli expects the market to grow from $42 billion in 2016 to $61 billion next year.But there's more: just last year, Harman announced a number of collaborations indicating its growing importance in the world of voice activated controls. In September, it agreed to incorporate Baidu speech recognition and synthesis technology in smart speakers so people can use voice commands to turn on audio experiences and access on-demand services.Earlier, the two collaborated to create CarLife offering advanced Internet capabilities, entertainment features and location-based services on HARMAN's in-vehicle infotainment head units for the Chinese market. At the World of Watson conference last October, Harman collaborated with IBM to bring voice activated intelligent assistance based on IoT and cognitive computing to hotels, offices and hospitals across the world.Along Comes SoundHoundKeyvan Mohajer of SoundHound says, ""We are at the inflection point of our long-term vision that every product or service needs to have a smart voice-enabled interface, and consumers have increasingly high expectations for this requirement, beyond simple commands or skills,"" said Mohajer.He may be right because of the $115 million raised in its 10-year long life, $75 million was contributed just last week from a group of companies including NVIDIA, Samsung's Catalyst Fund, Nomura Holdings, Sompo Japan Nipponkoa Insurance, Recruit Holdings' RSI Fund, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, SharesPost 100 Fund and MKaNN. Global Catalyst Partners, Walden Venture Capital and Translink Capital Partners participated for a second time.The reason the investment is significant at this juncture is SoundHound's voice interface technology called Houndify that will now be empowered to reach more users. Houndify was incorporated into more than 500 products within the first 12 months of launch.Its popularity in the past and why companies like Samsung and NVIDIA are interested in it right now is simple. The technology is not designed to take over the device or transfer data to SoundHound unlike platforms like Alexa and Google Home. So its proliferation will let device makers employ the technology and also retain user data. Houndify already has 20K developers working on the platform and this number could expand rapidly with the cash infusion. Houndify already hasSumming UpInteraction with machines is set to become more interesting than ever before as they gradually understand our needs to get things done the way we want it even before we tell them to or perhaps right after. Since this is a nascent market, there may not be any clear winners. Right now it does look as if there's enough growth opportunity for all the above players and more.Zacks' Top 10 Stocks for 2017In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2017?Who wouldn't?

The stock moved a bit over 4% on the week. Still, BBRY's march away from hardware devices and towards software sales will pay off. And with potential earnings growth of 31.6% next year (perFinviz), BBRY may make a run back to $8 a share.makeArticleAd();Source:WEi WEi via FlickrNokia Corp (ADR)(NYSE:NOK), BlackBerry's former rival, trades at a price-to-sales ratio of 1.11.

3 Covered Calls to Cash in on Blue-Chip Stocks;2/9/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOptions are still considered rather exotic securities by the average investor, and in some ways, that's a good thing. They can be exotic and there is a higher degree of risk associated with them, depending on what one's investment goals are. I made big mistakes using options early in my investing life because I didn't really have a clear purpose for using them.makeArticleAd();Source:401(K)2012 via FlickrHowever, there is one basic strategy that may be of interest to the average income investor, and it's a strategy involving covered calls. This is one of a few strategies I'll be using in my forthcoming stock advisory newsletter,The Liberty Portfolio.With covered calls, you either own a stock or purchase it, and then sell the right, but not the obligation, for another person to buy that stock from you at a given price on a given day. It generates income for you when you sell the call.7 High-Risk, High-Reward Stocks to Buy NowI sometimes like to use blue-chip stocks when selling covered calls. That's because they tend to have modest premiums, and if you don't have the stock called away, you are still owning a quality company. If it does get called away, you can always buy it back.Covered Calls: Microsoft (MSFT)Source:Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified)Microsoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) is a prime candidate for selling covered calls against blue-chip stocks. Believe it or not, MSFT is right near its all-time high and it has tons of cash.I actually think it's overpriced here at 30 times earnings with only 10% earnings growth, so if you own it and it gets called away, you may want to consider waiting for a price drop before buying back in.MSFT closed Wednesday at $63.34. The 24 March $63.50 covered calls are selling for $1.10. That's a very modest return of 1.74% for a holding period of 44 days, or about 13% annualized. It's a bit less than I'd like to get, but reasonable.Covered Calls: Exxon Mobil (XOM)Source:Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified)Oil prices seem to have stabilized butExxon Mobil Corporation(NYSE:XOM) has fallen out of favor with investors. After doing exceptionally well compared to most blue chips in the oil patch, XOM stock has floundered a bit.I think it's due to concerns over big expenses coming up, but I think this is unfounded. As I've written, I believe the Rex Tillerson confirmation will eventually lead to the big Rosneft deal starting to produce.There's probably also some concern about valuation. On an EV-to-Ebitda ratio, which I think is the best way to evaluate the big producers, it's expensive compared to almost all of its peers. Thus, I think a near-to-medium term decline seems likely, so having XOM called away is not a bad thing.12 Stocks That Will Live and Die by Donald Trump's PenXOM closed Wednesday at $81.50. The 24 March $81.50 covered calls are selling for $1.78. That's 2.2% returned in 44 days, or about 18% annualized.Covered Calls: AT&T (T)Source: ShutterstockAT&T Inc.(NYSE:T) can sometimes be one of the blue-chip stocks to sell covered calls against. For starters, despite its mountain of debt, it produces amazing amounts of free cash flow.It usually pays out about half to cover its 4.77% dividend. It recently hit a multi-year high, added DirecTV to its portfolio, and is now trying to merge withTime Warner Inc(NYSE:TWX).The merger makes great sense, but given President Trump's hawkishness toward media these days, some people think he might try to pressure agencies to block it. I don't think that'll happen, but it may put near-term pressure on the stock.T closed Wednesday at $41.21. The 24 March $41.50 covered calls are selling for 65, cents which is a return of 1.6%. However, if called away, you pick up another 29 cents in capital gains, or 0.7%, for a total of 2.3%.Lawrence Meyers is the CEO of PDL Capital, and manager of the forthcomingLiberty Portfolio stock newsletter. As of this writing, has no position in any stock mentioned. He has 22 years' experience in the stock market, and has written more than 1,600 articles on investing.

Snap Just Became One of Google's Most Important Cloud Customers;2/9/2017;"One of the many interesting details revealed inSnap's S-1 filing with the SEC is that it agreed to a $2 billion   contract with Google Cloud in January. The agreement with theAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) subsidiary spans five years with   relatively equal payments scheduled for every year.Snap has used Google Cloud since its creation, but had been   spending considerably less than the $400 million per year it's   slated to spend through 2021. For the first few years of its   existence, it spent less than $30 million per year on Google   Cloud. Last year, however, it started seeing its hosting costs   increase considerably, up $192 million for the year.Image Source: GettymakeArticleAd();Google's cloud service competes against the largerAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Web Services andMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Azure. A $2 billion infusion could help it catch   up to the competition.What does $2 billion mean to Google Cloud?Alphabet isn't exactly forthright with its cloud revenue. It   lumps Google Cloud in with Google's other revenue line item,   which also includes Google Play and hardware sales. In 2016, the   three categories produced $10.1 billion in revenue. Google Play   likely accounts for the bulk of revenue.The cloud unit had an estimated run rate of just $1 billion as   of the end of 2015, according to RBC Capital. Snap's new contract   likely makes it Google's biggest cloud customer.While Google has made several advancements in its cloud   services over the past year, so have its competitors. Microsoft   boasted that its Azure revenue increased 93% last quarter, but   Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss estimates the unit brought in   just $1.6 billion. Bernstein's Mark Mordler estimates Azure's run   rate at $3 billion as of last quarter.Meanwhile, Amazon just reported AWS sales topped $12 billion   in 2016. Sales surpassed $3.5 billion in the fourth quarter   alone, although that fell short of analysts expectations.Google still needs to diversifyThe growth of Snapchat has been a major boon to Google's cloud   services, but it's still actively seeking to pull customers away   from its competitors and take market share. The hiring of   cloud-computing veteran Diane Greene to lead the division has   helped the company attract numerous high-profile customers, but   there's still more work to do.On Alphabet's fourth-quarter earnings call, Google CEO Sundar   Pichai said, ""We have truly differentiated offerings in four key   areas: data analytics and machine learning, security and privacy,   tools for application development, and the ability to create   connected business platforms."" Snap can take advantage of at   least three of those four factors, so it's clear why it was   willing to lock down a long-term contract.At the same time, the contract is not exclusive. If Snap wants   to enter China, for example, where Google doesn't operate, it   could tap one of Google's competitors. Or it could build its   own servers.Snap recently hired Jerry Hunter from AWS, who ran global data   centers for the cloud-computing giant. In Snap's S-1 filing,   management notes, ""In the future, we may invest in building our   own infrastructure to better serve our customers.""If Snap continues to grow at the pace it has been for the last   few years, it may make economic sense for it to switch to its own   cloud infrastructure, which would be a huge blow for Google.What this means for SnapSnap is now on the hook for $400 million per year in cloud   costs. There is some wiggle room: The contract says it can   postpone up to 15% of expenses for a year, so it only has to   spend $340 million this first year. Still, that's a huge amount   for a company that generated just $404.5 million in revenue last   year.It also means that switching service providers will be   difficult, considering it would either have to eat the contract   as a loss, or leave at least some of its operations on Google   Cloud in order not to waste the money. That makes the economics   of building out its own infrastructure within the next five years   even costlier.On the flip side, analysts expect Snap's revenue to continue   growing at a rapid pace, approaching $1 billion this year fueled   by continued user growth and product expansion that will surely   put additional demands on Google's servers. It has plenty of   capital to cover the expense, and if last year's growth is any   indication of what to expect, it will need to spend at least $340   million on cloud infrastructure this year. The deal with Google   ensures that it gets the lowest rates possible, so it can to make   the most of its spend.Overall, it's not a bad deal for Snap, but it does tie the   company to Google for a long time.10 stocks we like better than Alphabet (A     shares)When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Here's Why Adobe Systems Incorporated Stock Will Continue To Soar;2/9/2017;"If anyone deserved a promotion, it'sAdobe(NASDAQ: ADBE) CEO and president Shantanu Narayen. Coming off   another stellar quarter and fiscal year, Narayen has Adobe   soaring, and he's earned his recently announced position of board   chairman to go alongside his roles as CEO and president. One of   the reasons Narayen warrants his chairman role is Adobe's   constant pushing of the innovation envelope.Adobe has long held the distinction in the design community of   being a leading packaged-software provider. But thanks to a few   targeted acquisitions and internal development efforts, Adobe is   now a cloud leader as well. A recent concept video speaks   directly to Adobe's willingness to explore new opportunities,   despite what some pundits think.Adobe Cloud. Image source: Adobe.makeArticleAd();Reading between the linesShortly after Adobe shared a voice-editing feature it's   exploring, it released a ""concept video"" demonstrating a similar   functionality for images. The demo of a voice-activated digital   assistant shows a user changing the size, framing, and saving of   an image. The demo finishes with a voice command that instantly   loads the edited pic onto the user's social-media page.A number of industry pundits chimed in with their   disappointment in the feature, complaining about how ""simplistic""   it is. They missed the point entirely. There's a reason Adobe   called it a concept video: The technology hasn't even progressed   to the beta-testing stage. The demo was simply a way to introduce   another of the innovations Adobe is undertaking to stay ahead of   the curve.Some creative types also bemoaned the notion of having to   learn another method -- in this case a voice-activated personal   assistant -- for editing their projects. But there's a reason   some of the biggest players in the tech industry, including Adobe   strategic partnerMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) , are testing voice-activated assistants   incorporating artificial intelligence, like the Windows king's   Cortana.According to one estimate, the use of virtual assistants will   grow by nearly 35% annually over the next seven years, becoming a   more than $11 billion market. As voice-activated tools like   Adobe's early-phase editing tool expand their capabilities, just   as with Cortana, using the technology will become second   nature.The bigger pictureSetting the criticisms aside, Adobe's editing demo speaks   directly to its commitment to innovation. In addition to working   together on incorporating virtual reality (VR) and augmented   reality (AR) into Adobe's design solutions -- a natural fit for   creative folks -- the two companies recently partnered in the   cloud, using Microsoft's Azure platform to incorporate artificial   intelligence (AI) and advanced analytics into Adobe's Marketing   Cloud solutions.Just as with its editing-assistant demo, the strategic   alignment with Microsoft is an indication that Adobe has no   intention of resting on its laurels, which should be music to the   ears of investors -- particularly those concerned with Adobe's   incredible performance of late.Coming off a quarter and fiscal year in which Adobe reported   record revenue of $1.61 billion and $5.85 billion respectively,   its shareholders have enjoyed a 44% jump in stock price the past   12 months. Some may question Adobe's relative value, given its   trading at a whopping 49 times earnings. Don't.Due in part to continuously exploring cutting-edge new   features and technologies, Adobe stock is trading at a mere 24   times forward earnings, less than half its current valuation.   Another feather in Adobe's cap is that its transition to an   annual recurring revenue (ARR) model is hitting on all cylinders.   Adobe exited last quarter with trailing ARR of $4.01 billion.In addition to building a strong, relatively stable revenue   foundation, ARR also gives Adobe the flexibility to focus its   spending on developing new advanced functionalities. Much of the   12.7% increase in operating expenses last year, which was more   than offset by Adobe's 22% increase in revenue, was spent on   research and development.Adobe's decision to act, rather than react, to the   ever-changing possibilities offered by new technologies is a big   reason it will continue to outperform its peers...despite what   near-sighted pundits may think.10 stocks we like better than Adobe SystemsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Burned by FireEye Inc (FEYE) Stock? Try These Rebound Trades;2/9/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThere was much hype surroundingFireEye Inc(NASDAQ:FEYE) back in 2015. The company had just come off revenue growth of 163% the year prior, and FireEye was the first cybersecurity firm to be certified under the Safety Act. But the company fell prey to a major faux pas in the technology world - it didn't innovate fast enough, and FEYE stock is now paying the price.makeArticleAd();Source:Fortune Brainstorm TECH via FlickrIn 2014, the cloud business model was breaking onto the scene, and it was creating enough of a stir that even major players likeCisco Systems, Inc.(NASDAQ:CSCO) andMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) were making significant moves into the new market. It was a lesson FireEye learned too late, as evidenced by the company's recent quarterly earnings report.Despite a major push and a plethora of incentives to boost sales, FireEye's revenue of $184.7 million missed Wall Street's estimates of $191 million. But the topline figure wasn't the only concern, as FireEye guided to a 3% decline in first-quarter revenue, compared to the Street's expected 5% growth.Among the myriad of problems facing the company, including slower corporate enterprise spending and increased competition in the cybersecurity market, FireEye's late restructuring into a cloud-subscription model is almost unforgivable - especially when blue-chip security firms were already headed that direction.But there is a bright side for FEYE stock investors, at least over the short term. Barring any other major surprises or management short-sightedness (CFO Mike Berry and board chairman David DeWalt are both stepping down, which could help), the worst appears to be already factored into FEYE's price. As such, literally any positive news for the company could kick off a short-term bounce.7 High-Risk, High-Reward Stocks to Buy NowAs usual, potential drivers for such a bounce would come from FEYE's sentiment backdrop. For instance, Thomson/First Call reports that 21 of the 31 analysts following FEYE stock rate the shares a ""hold"" or worse. The fact that there aren't more ""sell"" ratings after last week's quarterly report tells me that Wall Street is ready to reward FireEye for moving in the right direction. In other words, upgrades are a distinct possibility following any positive progress.Elsewhere, short sellers are already taking profits on FEYE. As of the most recent reporting period, the number of FEYE shares sold short dropped by 3% to 20.3 million. Still, roughly 13.3% of FireEye's float remains sold short, and could spark a round of profit taking or a covering rally if the stock can find its feet and move higher.Click to EnlargeJudging by FEYE's options configuration, short sellers may be preparing for just such an outcome. Currently, the March put/call open interest ratio for FEYE stock rests at 0.44, with calls more than doubling puts among options set to expire on March 17.FEYE is trading well below all major put and call accumulations in the series, with the $13 strike home to peak put OI and $14 representing the next significant call OI strike, leaving little in the way of potential options headwinds in the short term.March implieds, meanwhile, are pricing in a potential move of about 12.6% for volatile FEYE stock. This places the upper bound at $12.39, while the lower bound rests at $9.61.2 Trades for FEYE StockCall Spread:Bearish sentiment on an underperforming stock is to be expected, but FEYE stock is trading at oversold levels following a post-earnings beating. With said beating now out of the way, FEYE should trend higher, with any positive news providing additional lift.Those traders looking to take a risk on an FEYE comeback over the short-term might want to consider a March $12/$13 bull call spread. At last check, this spread was offered at 19 cents, or $19 per pair of contracts. Breakeven lies at $12.19, while a maximum profit of 81 cents, or $81 per pair of contracts, is possible if FEYE stock closes at or above $13 when March options expire.The Smart Money: Sears Holdings Corp (SHLD) Is Already InsolventPut Sell:Those looking for a more bullish-to-neutral position may want to look at a FEYE March $10 put sell position. At last check, this put was bid at 25 cents, or $25 per contract. Remember that you keep the initial premium received as long as FEYE stock closes above $10 when March options expire. However, if FEYE trades below $10 ahead of expiration, you could be assigned 100 shares of stock for every put sold at a cost of $10 per share.As of this writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace3 Stocks to Buy for Their Coming ReboundThe 2 Best, and 2 Worst, Dow Dividend Stocks TodayThe postBurned by FireEye Inc (FEYE) Stock?

Why Fitbit Inc (FIT) Needs to Wise Up Before It Can Win Again;2/9/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFitbit Inc(NYSE:FIT) may be great to improve your health, but as for Fitbit stock, it has been lethal for investors. During the last 12 months, FIT stock is off a horrendous 60%. This is certainly another case study of how high-profile IPOs can quickly come undone.makeArticleAd();Source:Via FitbitBut what about the future? Is there hope for Fitbit stock? Might there be a value play here?As I've written various times for InvestorPlace, it's probably not a good idea to be hopeful. For example, FIT is a company that develops a product that really is not a must-have. According to a recent study fromGartner, the abandonment rate on fitness trackers is 30%. The most common reasons for this include: users either get bored or the device breaks!The conclusion from the report: ""Dropout from device usage is a serious problem for the industry. The abandonment rate is quite high relative to the usage rate. To offer a compelling enough value proposition, the uses for wearable devices need to be distinct from what smartphones typically provide. Wearables makers need to engage users with incentives and gamification.""The Other Problems for FIT StockBut this is definitely not the only major issue with Fitbit stock. Let's face it, the competitive environment remains intense. The company must fight against tough rivals likeGarmin Ltd.(NASDAQ:GRMN),Samsung(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) andMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT). Although, the biggest threat isApple Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AAPL) Apple Watch, which is still in the early phases.7 Stocks That Will Drop by 10% or More This QuarterIn light of all this, is it any wonder that Wall Street is concerned with FIT stock? Of course not.More importantly, the company is already reporting major problems, as seen with the latest warning on fourth-quarter earnings. Fitbit's guidance calls for a loss of 51 cents to 56 cents a share on revenues of $572 million to $580 million. By comparison, the prior forecast was for earnings of 14 cents to 18 cents a share and revenues of $725 million to $750 million. Overall, it looks like the holiday season turned out to be a disaster for the company.Unfortunately, the bad situation isexpected to continue. The full-year prediction is for revenues of $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion and a loss of 22 cents to 44 cents a share on FIT stock. Wall Street, on the other hand, was looking for a much more robust $2.38 billion on the top-line and profits of 64 cents a share.Bottom Line on Fitbit StockTo deal with the challenges, FIT has a plan that looks weak. The company expects to reduce the workforce by mere 6% and to take other vague efforts to reduce operating costs, leverage data and launch products into new categories. Interesting enough, Fitbit wants to focus more on the smartwatch market, but this will likely mean more expenses.3 Reasons Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock Is STILL the KingEven worse, CEO James Parksaidthat the issues with the company were ""temporary"" and the ""performance is not reflective of the value of our brand, market-leading platform, and company's long-term potential.""Huh? Well, this really does seem like the talk of someone who is out-of-touch. And this should definitely be ominous for holders of FIT stock.Granted, perhaps there may be a buyout. But when it comes to broken hardware companies, this may be wishful thinking. For example, think about how long the rumors for a purchase of the beleagueredBlackBerry Ltd(NASDAQ:BBRY) have existed.For the most part, Fitbit stock may not be very interesting to a suitor. And this is not because the products are sub-par. Instead, it could be as simple as that the market has hit maturation levels and that big players like AAPL stand to capture a big part of what's available.Tom Taulli runs the InvestorPlace blogIPO Playbook.

Watch User Engagement When Twitter Inc (TWTR) Stock Reports Earnings;2/8/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTwitter Inc(NYSE:TWTR) is either a buyout target worth at least 20 percent more or is trading at roughlyfair valuein the $13 billion - $16 billion market cap range. Last year, rumors thatSalesforce.com, Inc.(NYSE:CRM) orMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) might buy it sent the stock trading at unsustainable levels.makeArticleAd();Source:Freestocks via UnsplashThe market has since removed any takeout premium from its stock price. Good fourth-quarter engagement numbers could therefore have a positive influence on the stock price.Previous Quarter Highlighted TWTR Stock's GrowthCEO Jack Dorsey stressed evidence of accelerating growth with its audience. Introducing new products and encouraging higher audience engagement are two goals for Twitter for this year. And last quarter, it focused on live events.By delivering on a better user experience, TWTR stock has a good chance of reporting higher engagement numbers. This includes DAU (daily active users), MAU (monthly active users) and time spent on the site. If these numbers are up, advertisers will willingly spend more per click and campaign.7 Tech Stocks With Explosive Growth PotentialAnalysts have low expectations for TWTR revenue and expect sales growth of only 4.2% year-over-year. The average revenue estimate is $740.13 million (the range is $713.4 million - $769.8 million. Yet for the full year, analysts expect sales growing 15% but just 9.3% next year.Also expect strong user engagement from the live events. TWTR launched the live initiative last September. It syndicated the experience to its partners, includingYahoo! Inc.(NASDAQ:YHOO),AOL,SBNationandSports Illustrated. Its TV partners, which includedApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft andAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN), were also channels for Twitter's platform.Presidential Election TweetsTwitter's 10.4% jump in the last week may already show the benefit of tweet volume increasing during the U.S. elections. Advertisers likely bid higher rates for exposure on the platform in that time.That could mean TWTR's revenue beats analyst expectations. Twitter noted that debates will help DAU numbers, but the platform requires constant live content tosustainquarterly active user growth:""We want to really leverage this nationally and globally recognized content on live to build awareness of underserved so that we do have a dependable place to find live content. So we're very encouraged by those events, but for them to have an impact over a 90-day period our live strategy has to be more fully rolled out. And we're on the process of doing that.""Live events will fuel Twitter's fourth-quarter revenue growth, although management gave no forecast on what it expects. Last quarter, the company cut its sales force. The restructuring from three channelsdown to twowill disrupt the short-term business results. In the next few quarters, expect improved operating efficiency to add meaningfully to profit margin.SNAP IPO Casts Shadow Over TwitterSnapchat's upcoming IPO, whichFortune Magazinesays may be the mostexpensivetech IPO ever, will cast a shadow on Twitter. Not only will markets ignore the lofty valuations for SNAP, but the company's cash injection will give SNAP the resources to invest in R&D and staff.Take a Free Ride on Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT) StockInvestors may also ignore the non-voting rights for Snapchat's shares. As SNAP stock soars, more investors will speculate on it, taking the attention away from Twitter.Twitter's earnings report on Feb. 9 should bring no negative surprises. The company cut expenses and turned its focus on live events. By doubling down on its strength of delivering live-tweeting in real time for sports events, user engagement likely improved. That news is good enough to send the stock higher.As of this writing, Chris Lau did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace7 Stocks That Will Drop by 10% or More This Quarter9 Best Cheap Stocks to Buy Now Under $9.99The postWatch User Engagement When Twitter Inc (TWTR) Stock Reports Earningsappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Technology ETFs Hitting All-Time High;2/8/2017;"Most of the sectors have been shining this year on proposed Trump policies and stronger earnings and, technology is no exception. In fact, almost every corner of the tech sector is delivering robust performances pushing the stocks higher (read:Will Trump's New Policies Hurt These Sector ETFs & Stocks?).makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');Behind the SurgeMost of the gains came from a string of better-than-expected Q4 results from heavyweights such as IntelINTC, International Business MachinesIBM, NetflixNFLX, MicrosoftMSFT, AppleAAPLand FacebookFBthat have injected a strong momentum into the entire sector, pushing many stocks to fresh highs.Additionally, a strengthening economy and better job prospects gave a solid boost to economically sensitive growth sectors like technology that typically perform well in a maturing economic cycle. Consolidation, increasing consumer spending and rising consumer confidence added to the strength.  Particularly, global IT spending is expected to increase 2.7% to $3.5 trillion this year, according to Gartner while Forrester projects spending to grow 3-4%.In the current emerging digital world, demand for advanced technologies such as cloud computing, big data, smartphones, high-speed fiber networks and the Internet of Things is growing by leaps and bounds. The adoption of innovative products such as wearables, VR headsets, drones, and virtual reality devices are fast becoming technology staples for savvy Americans. This is creating great opportunities for tech companies.Not to forget, most of these tech companies are sitting on a huge cash pile and are in a position to increase payouts to their shareholders. The cash reserves will ensure that these companies are not plagued by financial trouble in a rising interest rate environment.Further, Trump's proposed corporate tax reform, that could allow companies to bring back cash being held overseas at lower rates, is good for tech companies though his protectionist rhetoric including crackdown on immigration and travel ban is weighing on the sector (read:Top ETF Stories of January 2017).Moreover, the upside in this corner of the space could be confirmed by the ZacksSectorRank in the top 38% at the time of writing, suggesting solid growth prospects in the coming months.Given this, tech ETFs have been hitting all-time high levels in recent trading sessions.

"ABB Ltd. (ABB) Beats on Q4 Earnings; Macro Issues Linger";2/8/2017;"ABB Ltd.ABBreported operational earnings per share of 33 cents, down 5% year over year. Steady revenues and diligent cost-saving initiatives helped maintain earnings; however, it was more than offset by tough macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions which ultimately affected revenues. However, earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 27 cents.Despite the beat, ABB's shares were down 2.6% inpre-market trading, as global economic uncertainty and geopolitical developments signal mixed prospects for the company.Operational earnings for the full year came in at $1.29, up 3% year over year.Quarterly revenues were down 3% year over year and came in at $8,993 million. All round weakness and declines in the mining and oil and gas markets proved to be headwinds, more than offsetting steady execution of a healthy order backlog in the Power Grids space. Individually, revenues took a beating in three of the four segments of the company, thus dragging the overall top line. However, revenues came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8,914 million.For full-year 2016, revenues were down 5% as declines in Discrete Automation and Motion and Process Automation offset growth in Power Grids and Electrification Products. Total services and software revenues grew 3 percent (0 percent in US dollars) to 17.8Revenue by SegmentsDiscrete Automation & Motion(down 3% to $2,211 million): Sales remained steady on strong demand trends in robotics and the light industry; but declines in oil & gas industry arrested the unit's momentum. However, orders of this segment inched up 1% to $2,013 million on a year-over-year basis. The company said that this segment's electric vehicle charging, solar and power quality businesses were to be transferred to Electrification Products segment, effective Jan 1, 2017, due to expected synergistic prospects.Electrification Products(flat year over year at $2,462 million): Good execution of the systems backlog and higher demand in building products supported revenues. Orders were down 8% year over year to $2,157 million on account of persistent poor performance in the U.S., Canada and the UK. The transfer of the electric vehicle charging, solar and power quality businesses is likely to have a dampening effect on this unit's margin.Process Automation(down 10% to $1,737 million): Revenues were down in this segment, particularly due to declines in discretionary spending in oil & gas and related sectors. Orders declined 15% to $1,520 million, owing to lower capital spending in process industries and constrained discretionary spending in process industries.Power Grids(down 2% to $3,042 million): Currency fluctuations and adverse dragged the revenues, despite steady execution of a healthy order backlog. Orders rose 10% to $2,879 million mainly due to significant large contract awards.Total orders remained steady year over year at $8,277 million and were up 3% on a comparable basis, driven by large contract awards. Base orders shrunk 1% on a year-over-year basis, while large orders went up 35%. The order backlog at quarter end amounted to $23 billion (down 1% year over year).On a geographic basis, European countries, namely Spain, Norway and the UK witnessed order growth, which was more than offset by order declines in Turkey, France and the Netherlands. Orders were steady in the Americas, as the U.S. grew 9%, offsetting declines in Canada and Brazil. The Asia, Middle East and Africa (AMEA) witnessed robust performance with order growth in India and China, which more than offset order declines in Saudi Arabia and other parts of South East Asia.Book-to-bill ratio at the end of the fourth quarter was 0.92, up from 0.89 in the comparable quarter a year ago.Operational earnings before interest, taxes and amortization (""Operational EBITA"") in the quarter under view dipped 4% year over year to $1,057 million.Next Level Strategy: Stage 3In the third quarter, ABB launched the third stage of the revamped version of its ""Next Level Strategy"" which focuses on three areas, namely profitable growth, relentless execution and business-led collaboration. This stage calls for restructuring the company's divisions into four market-leading entrepreneurial businesses, unlocking its full digital potential, increasing momentum in operational excellence and boosting the company's brand.ABB will restructure its business into four segments: Electrification Products, Robotics and Motion, Industrial Automation and Power Grids, and the same will be effective from Jan 1, 2017. Further, in order to unlock its digital capabilities, ABB recently announced a strategic partnership with Microsoft CorporationMSFT, to shore up its capabilities in the industrial internet market, by combining cloud technology with industrial digital technology. Together, the companies will develop next-generation digital solutions on an integrated open cloud platform.Moreover, ABB is optimistic about its White-Collar Productivity savings program, which has surpassed expectations since its launch. Consequently, the company has raised the cost-reduction target under the program by 30% to $1.3 billion. Further, ABB is currently implementing its regular cost-savings programs to achieve savings equivalent to 3-5% of cost of sales each year. Another transition which the company is launching is to adopt a single corporate brand, by consolidating all its brands across the world under one umbrella.ABB Ltd Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseABB Ltd Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise|ABB Ltd QuoteLiquidity & Cash FlowsABB's cash and cash equivalents as of Dec 31, 2016 were $3,719 million compared with $4,565 million as of Dec 31, 2015. Total long-term debt fell to $5,800 million at the quarter end, from $5,985 million as of Dec 31, 2015.ABB's cash flow from operating activities came in at $1,519 million for the fourth quarter compared with $1,994 million in fourth-quarter 2015. The decline reflected ABB's focus on more stable quarterly cash generation throughout the year.Divestitures and PartnershipsDuring the third quarter, ABB decided to sell its global high-voltage cable system business to NKT Cables in a deal worth $934 million. The high-voltage cables unit is part of ABB's $11.6 billion Power Grids business. High voltage cables are the key components in sustainable energy networks.ABB and NKT Cables have also signed an agreement for a long-term strategic partnership, under which they will work together on future projects, in areas like sub-sea interconnections and direct current transmission links.ABB considered the offloaded unit as a niche business, which had been improving in recent times. However, the company is facing what will likely be the end to Europe's offshore wind-power boom years, as the industry grapples with shrinking investments and uncertainty over future subsidies.At the heart of it, the cables deal is part of ABB's active portfolio management and will make the core power grids business simpler, stronger, and more focused.Alongside, ABB also announced two important partnerships. It signed a partnership deal with engineering and construction firm, Fluor CorporationFLR. The deal was signed to cater to the growing needs of power grids worldwide for safe, dependable and state-of-the-art electrical substations. Through the strategic partnership, ABB and Fluor will execute large turnkey engineering, procurement, construction (""EPC"") electrical substation projects.Further, ABB formed an agreement to partner with Aibel to deliver offshore wind integration solutions. Per the contract, Aibel will be responsible for turnkey EPC services for the design, construction, installation and commissioning of the offshore platforms; while ABB will focus on high-voltage direct current technology.Per ABB, the two new alliances, in addition to greater focus on higher-margin consultancy services and software, will help elevate the Power Grids unit's margin target to 10-14% (up from a previous target of 8-12%).Share RepurchaseAt the end of the third quarter, ABB declared the completion of the $4-billion share buyback program introduced in Sep 2014. Under the program, the company repurchased approximately 171.3 million shares for about $3.5 billion.Consequently, ABB announced a new share buyback program of up to $3 billion from 2017 through 2019, reflecting consistent strength in cash generation and financial position.To ConcludeABB's fourth-quarter results recorded a rise in its quarterly orders for the first time since first-quarter 2015, driven by large contract awards. However, earnings still suffered from the uncertainties plaguing the process industries, from which the company derives a significant portion of its profits.Notwithstanding the turnaround in orders, energy markets are not expected to stabilize anytime soon, thus dampening ABB's short-term prospects. Lower capital spending for ABB's key upstream energy end-markets and foreign exchange volatility will likely continue to hurt its financials. The company is vulnerable to increased uncertainty stemming from the Brexit decision as well as geopolitical tensions elsewhere in the world, which are overshadowing global markets.Despite the negatives, we believe that the company's long-term growth prospects are stable. The company's three major customers in utilities, industry, and transport & infrastructure are likely to drive growth. Apart from this, positive development in electricity value chain, rapid progress of Internet of things, services and people and a surge in energy-efficient transport and infrastructure bode well.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderABB currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock Is Still Finding Growth;2/7/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMicrosoft Corporation(NYSE:MSFT) used to be a one-trick, maybe two-trick pony less than 10 years ago. My how things have changed.makeArticleAd();Source:Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified)Under founder Bill Gates, DOS and then Windows operating systems were on virtually every computer that wasn't anApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) machine. And that dominance continued unabated until the dotcom bubble burst.It wasn't the ensuing crash that hurt, it was the fact that tech had reached a point of inflection.From then on, it wasn't just about owning a fiber-optic switching company with a triple-digit price-to-earnings ratio. One of the sayings from those heady times was, if it doesn't have a triple digit P/E, it's not worth buying.The crash meant the internet and tech itself was growing up. There was plenty of consolidation that happened after the dotcom crash. Some worked out, some didn't. But it was necessary for companies that were going to survive to find a way to pivot into the new marketplace.9 Best Cheap Stocks to Buy Now Under $9.99It was also around that time that Microsoft was embroiled in a major antitrust case with the U.S. Government. This meant that MSFT had to change on many levels, just to survive. It was crucial to find a way out of this, because most of the government computers were running Windows, and if Microsoft couldn't find a bright path through the case, it may well lose a very lucrative long-term contract.By 2006, Gates was out of day-to-day operations and his No. 2, Steve Ballmer, took over. While he started strong, it wasn't long until it was apparent that doing the same thing a little differently was not going to cut it as technology was expanding rapidly and interconnections were popping among different tech fields.In 2014, the current CEO, Satya Nadella, took the helm and began to completely reorganize the company, shedding unprofitable and unwieldy divisions and focusing on the future of the company. That meant cleaning up the mess created by the acquisition of the mobile phone business ofNokiaand building a robust cloud-based business for both operating systems and for client storage.It certainly helped that he was previously head of MSFT R&D. But some were still skeptical of his approach, especially in the early days, when the new divisions weren't getting much traction and the established businesses were left wanting - remember Windows 8?Now three years into his role, Nadella has gone from potential goat to real hero. And the most recent earnings number prove out his strategy. He has remained focused and disciplined, and it has paid off.Microsoft has committed $1 billion into cybersecurity investment for its services as well as R&D. The company is reporting 600,000 to 700,000 attacks a week, up from about 20,000 just three years ago. But it's not as much the threat as the opportunity. According to tech sitetechemergence.com, there's an artificial intelligence-based cybersecurity market that will be worth $8.3 trillion market by 2035 in the U.S. alone.And given the fact that the U.S. government is one of MSFT stock's biggest clients, security is crucial.Why GoPro Inc (GPRO) Stock Deserves More PatienceGoing hand in hand with this is the impressive growth of Azure, Microsoft's cloud-based operating and storage system. Revenue growth year over year is running around 93% and Azure is getting big enough to compete with Amazon Web Services, the cloud division ofAmazon.com, Inc(NASDAQ:AMZN).Recent earnings were solid overall and there's no reason to think MSFT stock has seen its best days already. And while its 30 P/E may look expensive, AMZN is trading at a P/E of 185. And MSFT also delivers a solid 2.4% dividend as well.Richard Band'sProfitable Investingadvisory service helps retirement savers outperform the market without losing a minute of sleep along the way.

Why GoPro Inc (GPRO) Stock Deserves More Patience;2/6/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsShares ofGoPro Inc(NASDAQ:GPRO) have been under pressure, plunging as much as 14% Friday after the action camera maker reported fourth quarter fiscal 2016 earnings results Thursday afternoon that missed Wall Street's revenue expectations. But it's tough to ignore how GPRO stock, which is trading near 52-week lows, looks attractive from a risk versus reward perspective.makeArticleAd();Source:ETC-USC via Flickr (Modified)GoPro stock closed Friday at $9.58, down 12.7%. Even with Friday's punishment, the stock is still up 10% year-to-date, besting the 2.3% rise in theS&P 500index.Indeed, the fact that the company lowered guidance for the current quarter may have created a ceiling for the GPRO stock. For the current quarter, GoPro, which did not issue an earnings-per-share forecast, expects revenue of $200 million, up 9% year-over-year. This compares to Wall Street's estimates for $264 million.However, while the market focused solely on the the revenue miss and guide-down, investors ignored that not only did GoPro's profit margins improve, the company's adjusted EPS of 29 cents beat estimates by 7 cents. Notably, the $115.7 million loss the company posted in the fourth quarter, much of the total was due to a tax charge of $102 million.Plus, despite revenue of $540.6 million missing consensus estimates, it was nonetheless encouraging that GPRO managed to grow quarterly revenues by 24%. And with the company resuming Karma sales recently, there could also be a near-term floor on GoPro stock. Not to make light of the headwinds the company faces with a slowing market for cameras, but GPRO still has a dominant retail presence, which gives it an advantage over its competitors.Two Questions for GPRO StockAt the same time, GoPro is cutting costs to improve profitability. However, two main questions remain: How deep will the cuts go and can GoPro execute the cuts to achieve both revenue and profit objectives. In that regard, at some point CEO Nick Woodman, who promised last year that GoPro would be profitable in the fourth quarter, may now want to consider ""exploring strategic alternatives.""7 Tech Stocks With Explosive Growth PotentialThat is another way to say, a possible sale of the company should be on the table, which could free GPRO stock.More to the point, it's no longer a certainty that Goodman and gang can be trusted to lead GoPro out of this rut. Despite the many advantages GPRO has had as a brand, there have been too many missteps by management and self-inflicted wounds. Setbacks from the Hero5 camera and the Karma drone, which was recalled because of in-flight battery problems, are glaring examples.Microsoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) andFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) are two names with significantly better management that I think can take GoPro stock to the next level. Microsoft, which already has success with consumer products, such as the Xbox, should be able to leverage GPRO's cameras andsoftware toolsto enhance its AR and VR ambitions with HoloLens.As for Facebook, GoPro's drones and camera's would be ideal for Facebook's live video ambitions and 360 degree technology. And with GPRO's market cap now valued at just $1.35 billion and an enterprise value of $1 billion, it would be a drop in the bucket for either company. As for GoPro, with $225 million in cash on the balance sheet and zero debt.As of this writing, Richard Saintvilus did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 Stocks to Buy That Already Make America GreatThe Top 10 Dow Dividend Stocks for FebruaryThe postWhy GoPro Inc (GPRO) Stock Deserves More Patienceappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Midday Update: Stocks Defensive as Wall Street Weighs Fiscal Policies, Earnings, European Weakness;2/6/2017;"The Dow Jones Industrial Average continued to straddle the 20,000 mark as the struggle between buyers and sellers leaves the blue-chip index nearly unchanged from Friday's close.The uncertainty surrounding U.S. fiscal policy, remaining Q4 corporate earnings and pressure on European equities encouraged a cautious tone on Wall Street with all three benchmark averages slightly in the red.While equities trade defensively, the U.S. Treasury market was seeing yields pull back amid a safe-haven play, primarily in the belly of the yield curve. The 5-year and 10-year Treasury notes were both 6 basis points richer from Friday at 1.87% and 2.43%, respectively.makeArticleAd();The risk-off trade is weighing on the dollar against the yen, however, driving USD/JPY to its lowest level since November.Economic data was quite light on Monday with only the January Labor Market Conditions Index.

Here’s How Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Can Hit $200;2/6/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) delivered excellent earnings news Jan. 31 that pushed Apple stock to its highest level since the summer of 2015.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockThat's great news for long time owners of Apple stock who've had to suffer through a deluge of naysayers proclaiming its lack of innovation. More than a few have even suggestedinvestors dump AAPL stockand buyMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) stock in its place.Hey, I like Microsoft and I think what it'sdoing in the cloudis going to help it continue to grow over the next decade, but it's not in the same league when it comes to revenue and profit growth. Microsoft does, however, have a business model that's transitioning from one-time product sales to ongoing monthly recurring revenue, something many observers have noted is happening at Apple.Yes, Apple did sell more than78 millioniPhones in the first quarter, roughly five million more than it sold in the same quarter a year earlier, but it was the service revenue that had everyone in a tizzy.Jim Cramer likened the Apple business model tothe Gillette business model, where consumers buy a single razor and keep buying new razor blades; only in Apple's situation the iPhone is the razor and services such as the App Stores are the razor blades.You gotta love recurring revenue. Cramer does:""What has dogged Apple's stock for ages, what has kept its share price so low, at least in terms of its valuation, is the 'Blackberry-ization' issue,"" Cramer said onMad MoneyFeb. 1. ""The notion that in the end, the iPhone is just a device and device companies eventually get wasted asBlackBerry Ltd(NASDAQ:BBRY) did.""7 Tech Stocks With Explosive Growth PotentialThere's no question recurring revenue is good for a company's top and bottom line and should be welcome news for owners of Apple stock, but is it enough to drive Apple stock through its all-time high of $134.54 and upward to $200?That's debatable.While Apple's services revenue hit$7.2 billionin the first quarter, 18% higher than a year earlier, it's still only 9% of the company's overall revenue, or 100 basis points higher than a year earlier.By comparison, Microsoft's second quarter saw its service and other revenueincreased 29.7% to $7.5 billion. The only problem with that for Microsoft is the gross margins are 40% compared to 67.5% for its product revenue, which accounted for 68.5% of its overall revenue.You want your recurring revenue gross margins to be higher than your product margins, not lower; because if that's the way the world is headed, both stocks are looking at lower profits in the future.Apple doesn't break down its gross margins between products and segments. Overall, its gross margin in Q1 2017 was 38.5%, 160 basis points less than in Q1 2016. Microsoft's overall gross margin in its latest quarter was 58.9%, considerably higher than Apple's.That would seem to suggest Microsoft's in a better position when it comes to service revenue. It is both growing this aspect of its business faster than Apple and making more from every dollar of revenue. From this perspective, Apple is doomed.A quick look farther down the income statement, however, provides some clarity: Apple's operating margin in Q1 2017 was 29.9%; Microsoft's Q2 2017 operating margin was 25.7%, or 420 basis points less than Apple.The biggest reason for this difference: Microsoft spends about three times as much per year on research and development as Apple does; Apple spent 4.7% of its revenue in the trailing 12 months on R&D compared to 14.4% for Microsoft. And when you're talking about billions of dollars of annual revenue, the difference adds up quickly.Which brings us back to Apple's growing service revenue: InvestorPlace contributor Brad Moon highlightedthe positives of Apple's services revenuerecently. A couple of his points stick out for me.Don't Bet Against the Dow Jones Industrial AverageFirst, the App Store had $3 billion in revenue in December - a record. Secondly, Apple paid out more than $20 billion to developers in 2016. Extrapolate December's App Store sales over 12 months and you get $36 billion in revenue. Subtract $20 billion paid to developers in 2016 and that leaves a gross profit of $16 billion and a gross margin of 44%, which is pretty darn healthy considering very little R&D is required to keep that up and running.Can recurring revenue take Apple stock to $200? I believe it can. When, however, is another story.As of this writing, Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace3 Big Buyout Deals That Could Crush Investors9 Best Cheap Stocks to Buy Now Under $9.99The postHere's How Apple Inc.

Tech Companies Take a Stand Against Trump's Immigration Ban;2/6/2017;"Immigration has been a driving force behind many of the   leading technology companies in the United States.Some, includingMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) , are led by CEOs who were not born in this   country while over 200 companies on the Fortune 500 were started   by immigrants or their children. In addition most top tech brands   are global, with offices all over the world, and talent working   domestically that was not born in the U.S.At least partly because of that nearly 100 technology   companies including Microsoft,Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) ,Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) ,Facebook,Twitter, and many others have filed a legal brief in the U.S. Court of   Appeals for the 9th Circuit opposing President Donald Trump's   temporary immigration ban keeping people from seven predominantly   Muslim countries from entering the U.S. In the brief the   companies argue that the ban ""inflicts significant harm on   American business.""makeArticleAd();Trump signed an executive order banning immigration from     seven predominantly Muslim countries. Image source: Getty     Images.What are they opposing?In one of his first acts as president, Trump signed an   executive order banning refugees and visa-holders from seven   predominantly Muslim countries from entering the United States.   That order has been stayed by aU.S. District judgeand an appeals courtdeclined to immediately reinstatethe presidential order. The technology companies, many of which   operate and employ workers in and from the impacted countries   filed their brief to show their opposition to the president's   actions.""Immigrants make many of the Nation's greatest discoveries,   and create some of the country's most innovative and iconic   companies,"" the brief states. ""America has long recognized the   importance of protecting ourselves against those who would do us   harm. But it has done so while maintaining our fundamental   commitment to welcoming immigrants -- through increased   background checks and other controls on people seeking to enter   our country.""The companies that signed the brief acknowledged what Trump   was, at least on the surface, trying to accomplish with the   executive order.""We share your goal of ensuring that our immigration system   meets today's security needs and keeps our country safe,"" said a   draft of that letter obtained byBloomberg News. ""We are concerned, however, that your recent Executive Order   will affect many visa holders who work hard here in the United   States and contribute to our country's success.""Tech requires global talentPutting aside any political questions, the tech industry   opposes Trump's immigration ban in part because it takes global   talent to compete. The U.S. simply does not produce enough   workers -- specifically coders who write the software that powers   the products made by these companies -- to meet demand.To fill those needs companies across the U.S. use H1B visas to   receive special dispensation to hire workers who otherwise would   not be able to legally work in the country. A H1B visa, according   toMyVisaJobs.com, allows U.S. employers to temporarily employ foreign   professionals in specialty occupations for three years,   extendable to six years. ""To qualify for H1B Visa, the foreign   professional must hold a bachelor's or higher degree from an   accredited college or university in the specialty occupation,""   according to the site. In some cases specialized training can be   substituted for a degree.Technology companies dominate the list of employers using   workers on H1B visas. Data compiled by MyVisaJobs.com shows that   in 2016 Infosys held the top spot, having sponsored 25,405 visas.   while Microsoft, Apple, and Alphabet were all in the top 25.It's about more than self interestIt's easy to see the business reasons behind why these   technology companies oppose Trump's immigration restrictions.   Most, if not all of the companies that filed the brief would be   impacted by having employees unable to travel and in some cases   the executive order would impact hiring.For at least some of these companies, however, the opposition   goes beyond pure business logic. Many of these brands were either   founded by immigrants or by the children of immigrants and   immediate business concerns aside, they simply want a world where   new immigrants to the U.S. can be free to move here and found the   next Microsoft, Apple, or Alphabet.10 stocks we like better than MicrosoftWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Yet even given the torrid rally, large repeat call buying continues in CRM stock.makeArticleAd();Source:TopoI6 Via FlickrSalesforce also is poised at a critical technical breakout level and has been the topic of takeover talk in the past. Given all that, now might be the time to follow along with the big call buying and take a bullish position in Salesforce stock.As an options analyst, I look to identify situations where unusual option activity is evident. Many times these big option trades are done by ""informed"" institutional buyers who may have insider-type knowledge. They use calls to gain the potentially enormous leverage that options can provide in addition to their stock positions.Over the past few weeks, there has been large, repeat call buying in CRM options. Some of the more notable trades are highlighted below:20,000 May 90 calls on Jan. 2525,000 March 85 calls on Jan. 3016,000 May 90 calls on Jan. 3111,839 Apr 90 calls on Feb. 1These four trades alone account for over 72,000 call contracts, which control over 7.2 million shares of CRM stock. That's most assuredlynota small stake.9 Best Cheap Stocks to Buy Now Under $9.99From a technical standpoint, Salesforce is at a critical juncture. As the chart shows, CRM stock is trying to break out past the crucial $80 level, which could lead to a further move to all-time highs in the stock.Click to EnlargeSalesforce has has been the subject oftakeover chatterin the past.Microsoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) andOracle Corporation(NYSE:ORCL) have beenpotential rumored suitors, though obviously no deal has come to fruition yet.The enormous call buying has also had a big effect on option prices.

Current IV levels of 36% percentile far exceed historic volatility (HV) levels of only the 6% percentile.Click to EnlargeWith earnings not due out for another couple of weeks, it is highly unlikely the big-time call buying that is centered in April and May options is earnings-related.Since options prices (IV) are comparatively expensive, option selling strategies are favored. To position bullishly along with the big-time call buyers, selling out-of-the-money puts makes intuitive sense.How to Trade CRM Stock HereSell the CRM May $75 puts at $3.50 to openSell one put for each 100 shares of Salesforce stock you would be comfortable owning. The short $75 strike price is 6% below the $80.21 closing price of CRM.If Salesforce closes above $75 on May 19 expiration, you keep the $350 premium per put sold. If Salesforce closes below $75, you will be assigned the stock and end up buying shares at a net cost of $71.50.To avoid assignment, close out the trade if CRM stock is below $75 near expiration.As of this writing, Tim Biggam did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

See Which Of The Latest 13F Filers Holds Microsoft;2/6/2017;"AtHoldings Channel, we have reviewed the latest batch of the 21 most recent 13F filings for the 12/31/2016 reporting period, and noticed that Microsoft Corporation (Symbol: MSFT) was held by 11 of these funds. When hedge fund managers appear to be thinking alike, we find it is a good idea to take a closer look.Before we proceed, it is important to point out that 13F filings do not tell the whole story, because these funds are only required to disclose theirlongpositions with the SEC, but are not required to disclose theirshortpositions. A fund making a bearish bet against a stock by shorting calls, for example, might also be long some amount of stock as they trade around their overall bearish position. This long component could show up in a 13F filing and everyone might assume the fund is bullish, but this tells only part of the storybecause the bearish/short side of the position is not seen.makeArticleAd();Having given that caveat, we believe that looking atgroupsof 13F filings can be revealing, especially when comparing one holding period to another. Below, let's take a look at the change in MSFT positions, for this latest batch of 13F filers:FundNew Position?Change In Share CountChange In Market Value($ in 1000's)Tradewinds Capital Management LLCExisting-8,987+$1,164Cutter & CO Brokerage Inc.NEW+4,687+$291Jacobus Wealth Management Inc.Existing-1,080+$63Guardian Investment ManagementExisting+6,400+$649Boston PartnersExisting+722,276+$87,657Kissinger Financial Services LLCExisting+640+$56Financial Architects IncExisting-2,614+$161JJJ Advisors Inc.NEW+3,000+$186Cumberland Partners LtdExisting-8,050+$631Lbmc Investment Advisors LLCExisting-37+$15Provident Trust Co.ExistingUNCH$UNCHAggregate Change:+716,235+$90,873In terms of shares owned, we count 3 of the above funds having increased existing MSFT positions from 09/30/2016 to 12/31/2016, with 5 having decreased their positions and 2 new positions. Worth noting is thatTairen Capital Ltd, included in this recent batch of 13F filers, exited MSFT common stock as of 12/31/2016.Looking beyond these particular funds in this one batch of most recent filers, we tallied up the MSFT share count in the aggregate amongallof the funds which held MSFT at the 12/31/2016 reporting period (out of the 1,301 we looked at in total). We then compared that number to the sum total of MSFT shares those same funds held back at the 09/30/2016 period, to see how the aggregate share count held by hedge funds has moved for MSFT. We found that between these two periods, funds increased their holdings by 8,482,298 shares in the aggregate, from 570,825,175 up to 579,307,473 for a share count increase of approximately 1.49%.

There were the 200 quadcopters fromIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) that were part of Lady Gaga's halftime show. Those we were expecting, but another drone that showed up was a surprise.Amazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) chose the Super Bowl to tease Amazon Prime Air - packages delivered to your home by AMZN drones.makeArticleAd();Source: AmazonA big part of the Super Bowl experience is the advertising. This is the one time of year when viewers actuallywantto see commercials. And with those viewersestimated at over 100 million, companies that forked out over $5 million for a 30-second spot make a big splash.Heck, even in Canada, the networks wereforced to run American adsinstead of substituting local commercials.And those 100 million-plus viewers saw a very short teaser commercial with anAmazon drone hoveringoutside the window of a woman who had just ordered some snacks: Amazon Prime Air.10 Stocks to Buy That Already Make America GreatAccording to the voice of Alexa, AMZN's personal digital assistant, we can ""Look for delivery soon.""History of Amazon Prime AirHow can you talk about the history of a service that doesn't yet exist? In the case of Amazon Prime Air and its use of Amazon drones, there's already a big backstory to talk about. AMZNhas a websitewhere it describes the services, shows off a number of Amazon drone videos and even has an FAQ section that spikes out many of the details about Amazon Prime Air.""We're excited about Prime Air - a delivery system from Amazon designed to safely get packages to customers in 30 minutes or less using unmanned aerial vehicles, also called drones. Prime Air has great potential to enhance the services we already provide to millions of customers by providing rapid parcel delivery that will also increase the overall safety and efficiency of the transportation system.""The Amazon Prime Air storykicked off in 2013, when AMZN CEO Jeff Bezos took the wraps off a top secret project with Amazon drones on60 Minutes. Delivery of items under five pounds that would fit in the quadcopter's bucket would take place in under 30 minutes. At the time, Bezos told viewers to expect Amazon Prime Air within four to five years.Last December, a milestone was reached when AMZN claimedthe first Amazon drone delivery- an Amazon Fire TV and a bag of popcorn. As part of an Amazon Prime Air trial in the U.K., the company's drones had begun autonomously delivering packages to a very small group of consumers.Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Has a New Hero: Services!At the end of the year, the company hit the news again when it was discovered it hadfiled a patent for a flying warehousethat would serve as an airborne base for Amazon drone deliveries.When Can You Expect an Amazon Drone atYourWindow?Despite the Super Bowl ad and Alexa's promise that Amazon Prime Air is coming soon, it's a little early to get excited yet. In particular, there are regulatory hurdles to overcome. FAA restrictions on drones that aren't flying in line-of-site operation were the primary reason why the Amazon drone trial is taking place in the U.K. instead of here. AMZN even put up a small disclaimer on its ad:""Prime Air is not available in some states (or any really). Yet.""But the fact that it spent the big Super Bowl ad bucks and showed off that Amazon drone to millions of viewers shows AMZN is serious about this. Amazon Prime Air may not be launching tomorrow, but the company is determined to get people excited about drone delivery.

The product charges investors 20 basis points in fees (see:all the Large Cap ETFs here).Why the Move?The mega cap space of the broad U.S. stock market has been an area to watch lately given that the major bourses are again hovering around record levels. Trump's policy for the financial sector acted as a major catalyst for the stock market after a slew of anti-trade policies.

And, Surface and Azure are driving much of the optimism that has led MSFT stock to increase nearly 150% in a little over four years.But, lost in that optimism toward MSFT seems to be the fact that most of Microsoft's business is relatively unchanged from what it was three to four years ago - if not worse. Windows is a declining platform. There are multiple competitors trying to take down Office, and the cloud shift is cannibalizing some of Microsoft's SQL Server business.So, while there's a reason to see growth coming from Microsoft's new opportunities, investors in Microsoft stock need to remember that most of the business isn't nearly as attractive.Azure and Surface Are Driving Microsoft Stock HigherThere is reason for optimism toward Azure and Surface. The Surface line garners rave reviews, and sales have been strong. Microsoft has an impressive opportunity to drive commercial sales, with the company calling out a major contract with the U.K. Customs Service on its Q2 conference call.5 Stocks to Buy to Defy a Weak FebruaryGrowth in Azure has been even more impressive. Revenue increased 93% in the second quarter and 104% in the first half of FY17. Microsoft remains well behindAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) and its Amazon Web Services business. But, it has a clear opportunity to get to at least second place in what should be a large, fast-growing end market. That portends years of growth in Azure, a potential driver for MSFT stock.At the same time, however, Microsoft is a huge company, with trailing twelve-month revenue over $85 billion. And, neither Azure nor Surface represents a significant portion of those overall sales. Microsoft still doesn't break out Azure sales, but estimates suggest roughly $3 billion in fiscal 2017 - less than 4% of overall revenue.Per the MSFT 10-K, Surface sales were about $4.2 billion in fiscal 2016, and those sales actually declined 2% year over year in the second quarter. Some of that weakness came from the company's phasing out of Surface 3, and gross margins have improved. But, Azure and Surface combined are still less than 10% of total revenue. Even adding cloud computing as a whole, the figure barely gets to one-quarter next year, as MSFT is targeting a $20 billion run rate for commercial cloud.Simple math shows that it's tough for Microsoft to grow as a whole if only a small portion of revenue is driving that growth. Indeed, that's been the case this year. Overall revenue grew just 1.2% in the second quarter, and 0.8% for the first half. Excluding phone sales - where Microsoft has all but has exited the business - top-line growth was still under 5% in Q2 and Q1.Yet MSFT stock now is priced as a growth stock. That might be aggressive.MSFT Earnings Still Rely on Office and WindowsThe problem for MSFT stock is that so much of Microsoft's business still comes from its better-known products. The More Personal Computing segment generated nearly 50% of first half sales. That includes Windows revenue - which was almost 20% of FY16 sales - along with Xbox, Search, and devices (including Surface).Surface aside, that's not a particularly attractive group. Windows revenue seems likely to decline over the long term and has declined in each of the last two fiscal years. Bing has performed well of late, but in part because Microsoft has spent up to attract traffic. The Productivity and Business Processes segment is almost one-third of sales. Prior to Microsoft's acquisition ofLinkedIn Corp, it consisted primarily of Office and Dynamics, MSFT's CRM solution.First-half growth has been impressive, growing about 7%, excluding the contribution from LinkedIn. But, that comes after revenue in the segment declined between FY14 and FY16. While Office 365 sales growth looks solid, much of that growth is simply coming from a shift to ""on-premise"" Office licenses.Bottom Line on Microsoft StockThere are two concerns about the long-term growth prospects of Microsoft stock. The first is that some of the recent headline growth in categories such as cloud and office is simply coming from existing products. Some Azure sales are coming from customers switching away from Microsoft SQL Server. Office 365 sales aren't going to new customers who didn't have word processing software; rather, most subscribers are former users of disk-based Office products.A Trade War With China Puts These Stocks at RiskThe second concern is that so much of the business is stagnant (though bulls might say ""stable"" instead). That makes overall growth tough: if 20% of the business grows 20%, and the rest is flat or declining, overall growth rates stay in the 4% range.With MSFT stock steadily appreciated due almost solely to multiple appreciation, rather than earnings growth, investors are clearly expecting sales to pick up. But, it's important to remember that Azure and Surface won't be able to drive that acceleration on their own.As of this writing, Vince Martin did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace7 Stocks to Sell as Fear Returns to the Market5 Safe Dividend Stocks to Buy for RetirementThe Top 10 Dow Dividend Stocks for FebruaryThe postMicrosoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock Still Relies on Office and Windowsappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Amazon (AMZN) Q4 Earnings Beat, Revenues Miss Estimates;2/3/2017;"Amazon.com'sAMZNfourth-quarter 2016 earnings per share (EPS) of $1.54 cents surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.40.However, revenues of $43.74 billion lagged the consensus mark of $44.87 billion. The stock was down 4.15% in Thursday's after-hours trading in response to the lower-than-expected revenues, higher operating expenses and weak guidance.Over the last one year, the stock has however outperformed the Zacks  Electronic Commerce industry. It has gained 56.63% compared with the industry's gain of 47.98%.Last quarter, despite an increase in operating expenses, the company showed much better financial discipline. The spike in operating expenses was due to buildout of fulfillment centers, and increased spending on original TV shows and movies. Amazon Web Services (AWS) and India expansion-related expenses also resulted in higher spending.The North America and AWS segments contributed to profits while investments in international continued. Improvements in AWS were the result of operating efficiencies and increased utilization of assets.The numbers in detail-RevenuesAmazon reported revenues of $43.7 billion, up 33.7% sequentially and 22.4% from the year-ago quarter. Quarterly revenues were at the mid-point of the guidance range of $42-$45.5 billion.For the full year, revenues were $136 billion, up 27% from $107 billion in 2015.Both product and service sales were up sequentially and year over year. Service sales grew much stronger than product sales from the year-ago quarter (up 43.7% compared with product sales growth of 15.1%). Revenue distribution between the two was 70%/30%.The company generated record sales during this year's holiday season, primarily led by its devices strategy. Echo Dot, Fire TV Stick, Fire tablet and Amazon Echo topped the best-sellers list.Segment DetailsThe North America segment accounted for around 60% of sales, representing a sequential and year-over-year increase of 39% and 22%, respectively. The International segment accounted for 32%, up 31.6% sequentially and 17.9% year over year. The AWS segment was up 9.4% sequentially and a massive 47% year over year with revenue share at nearly 8%.North America: Media was up 30% sequentially and 7.1% year over year. EGM was up 40.9% sequentially and 24.8% year over year. Other was up 42.6% sequentially and 80.4% year over year.International: Media was up 35.6% sequentially and 2.6% from last year. Sales from EGM were up 30.5% sequentially and 23.8% from last year. Other revenue was up 19.35% sequentially and 17.9% year over year.AWS: The business contributed $3.5 billion in the fourth quarter. AWS is gaining momentum with customers including McDonald's, Workday, Capital One, Salesforce, GE Oil & Gas, Kellogg's, Brooks Brothers, Ferrara Candy Company, GPT Group, Hoya Corporation, Lionsgate, Macmillan Publishers India, RWE Czech Republic, and Bart & Associates Inc. Amazon ended the quarter with 42 available zones across 16 infrastructure regions. The Mumbai (India) region was added in the third quarter, which became the sixth region in the Asia Pacific. Amazon remains the cloud infrastructure leader, well ahead of MicrosoftMSFT, International Business Machines CorporationIBMand AlphabetGOOGL.Gross MarginGross margin was down 122 basis points (bps) sequentially but up 189 bps year over year to 33.8%. Sequential variations in gross margin were largely mix-related, although increased investments were also a factor. Growth in AWS had a positive impact on margin. Pricing is also an important factor, given the increase in product categories all over the world and Amazon's strategy of heavily discounting products and services while building a position in any market. Third party sites did better than retail, which was also a positive.Gross profit dollars were up 29.8% from last year. The consistently rising gross profit dollars from the year-ago period reflects the success of Amazon's strategy.Net income was up 197.2% sequentially and 55.4% year over year.Operating MetricsAmazon's operating expenses of $13.5 billion were up 24.3% sequentially and 31.4% from the year-ago quarter. Amazon's heavy investing activities (headcount, fulfillment centers, content, etc) over the past few quarters have been driving up its costs. Cost of goods sold increased 121 bps sequentially as a percentage of sales with marketing expense increasing 45 bps and technology and content increasing just 5 bps. All other expenses declined as a percentage of sales.The net result was an operating margin of 2.9%, up 111 bps sequentially but down 23 bps from the year-ago quarter. Amazon reported an operating profit of $1.3 billion compared with $575 million in the previous quarter and $1.1 billion in the year-ago quarter.North America segment's operating margin of 3.1% was up 176 bps sequentially and 15 bps year over year. The International segment's operating margin of 4.07% shrank 315 bps sequentially but was up 100 bps from the year-ago quarter. Operating margin of AWS was 26.2%, down 46 bps sequentially but up 207 bps year over year.Consolidated segment operating income (CSOI) was up 111 bps sequentially but down 23 basis points from the year-ago quarter.Net IncomeAmazon generated fourth quarter net income of $749 million, or 1.7% of sales, compared with $252 million, or 0.8% in the previous quarter and $500 million, or 1.3% of sales in the same quarter last year. There were no one-time items in the fourth quarter. Therefore, the GAAP EPS was the same as the pro forma EPS of $1.54 compared with 52 cents in the previous quarter and $1 in the year-ago quarter.Amazon.com, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS   SurpriseAmazon.com, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS   Surprise|Amazon.com, Inc. QuoteBalance Sheet and Cash FlowAmazon ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments balance of $19.81 billion, down $146 million sequentially. The company generated $10.65 billion of cash from operations, spending $2.01 billion on fixed assets (including internal-use software and website development costs) and $3 million on acquisitions. Principal repayments of capital lease obligations were $1 billion in the fourth quarter.GuidanceManagement provided guidance for the first quarter of 2017. Revenues are expected to include a 250 bps positive FX impact and come in around $33.25-33.75 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $35.83 billion. Operating income is expected to come in at approximately $250-$900 million.To ConcludeRetail: Amazon's retail business remains very hard to beat on price, choice, convenience, you name it. The company has a solid loyalty system in Prime and its FBA strategy, and content addition continues to add selection to Prime memberships. If Amazon is able to replicate its domestic success internationally, investors could see far more growth. At the moment, international contributes a third of revenue but generates just a fraction of profits.AWS:Amazon Web Services on the other hand is the cash cow for Amazon. The business generates much higher margins than retail, so it has a positive impact on Amazon's profitability. We remain optimistic about the functionality, partner ecosystem and the experience AWS offers and believe this will lead to continued customer wins.IoT:Amazon has converted the nascent smart home market into a potential area of growth, in a very short time, backed by its Alexa-powered Echo devices. With third-party partnerships, Amazon is making Alexa the central point of connecting IoT devices used in any household. , It appears that Echo is well poised to penetrate every stream of business on the back of Amazon's robust performance.The company has accelerated signing on third-party device makers, so that these companies integrate Amazon's voice assistant - Alexa - which brings them into the respective eco systems.Currently, Alexa is equipped with thousands of skills and can connect to any stream of business. We believe that Amazon has just started to unfold what it could do with Alexa.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderCurrently Amazon has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Best Place to Start Your Stock SearchToday, you are invited to download the full list of 220 Zacks Rank #1 """"Strong Buy"""" stocks - absolutely free of charge.

Apple Inc. (AAPL) Smartwatch Is Still Dominant Despite All the Doubt;2/3/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhenApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) CEO Tim Cook went on the attack against claims Apple Watch sales were in the dumpster his comments about record holiday sales were taken with a healthy dose of skepticism.makeArticleAd();Source: AppleAfter all, it was his job to talk up his company's products. Even a similar claim in Apple's Q1 earnings report seemed questionable, with no detail provided. However, a report on global smartwatch shipments for Q4 2016 supports AAPL's claims.The numbers say Apple Watch sales did indeed set a holiday record and took an even larger share of overall smartwatch sales that quarter than in the 2015 holidays.Defending Apple Watch SalesTim Cook had his work cut out for him after AAPL launched the Apple Watch Series 2 in September. Apple was counting on the new model to boost sales going into the holiday quarter of a year where consumer interest in smartwatches was slipping.Alphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) opted to skip its expected Android Wear 2 smartwatch operating system upgrade.Pebble, the early smartwatch pioneer, would soon collapse and have its assets bought up byFitbit Inc(NYSE:FIT).When research firm IDC released a report in December saying Apple Watch sales had tanked, dropping 71% from the previous year, Cook went on the offensive.In an e-mailtoReuters, he wrote:""Our data shows that Apple Watch is doing great and looks to be one of the most popular holiday gifts this year. Sales growth is off the charts. In fact, during the first week of holiday shopping, our sell-through of Apple Watch was greater than any week in the product's history. And as we expected, we're on track for the best quarter ever for Apple Watch.""The problem was, with a new model just launched and the crucial holiday shopping season ramping up, everyone was expecting AAPL to put a positive spin on Apple Watch sales. And without numbers to back it up, Cook's statement wasn't necessarily taken at face value.10 Companies That Are Bringing Jobs Back to AmericaEven Apple's Q1 earnings report, where the Apple Watch was noted to have set an ""all-time revenue record"" didn't convince everyone. AAPL didn't spike out any actual number to back that up and the Other division that includes the Apple Watch saw its revenue drop 8% year-over-year.AAPL Wasn't Blowing Smoke About Apple Watch SalesResearch firm Strategy Analytics released itsreport on global smartwatch shipments for Q4, 2016(the period corresponding to AAPL's Q1 2017). In it, global smartwatch sales are shown to have recovered from a slow first half, to mark a 1% increase over 2015. As for the Apple Watch?""Demand for Apple's new Watch Series 2 as a holiday-season gift in Western markets was surprisingly strong and it enabled Apple to clear a large backlog of smartwatch inventory during the quarter.""According to Strategy Analytics, that translated to a record 5.2 million Apple Watch sales in the fourth quarter, up from 5.1 million the previous year. In addition, while AAPL lost ground in the overall smartwatch market in 2016 - dropping to a 55% share compared to over 65% in 2015 by selling 2 million fewer smartwatches on the year - during the holiday quarter, the company captured over 63% of all smartwatch sales.Where Does This Leave AAPL and the Apple Watch?Apple is still the dominant smartwatch maker, and the Apple Watch Series 2 showed the company isn't sitting still. Its overall market share dropped to 55%, but it remains firmly on top.Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Has a New Hero: Services!Second placeSamsung Electronics Co Ltd(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) took a big hit over the holiday quarter, despite releasing a new model of its own, the Gear S3. Samsung's holiday quarter marketshare dropped from 16% to 9.8%, while its overall marketshare for 2016 dropped from 13% to 11.4%. A collection of other manufacturers from Fitbit toLGtook over one third of the market in 2016 (up from 21.6%) showing the increasing diversification of smartwatch sales.The smartwatch market still isn't setting the world on fire, but despite a slow 2016, any reports of its death are greatly exaggerated. And while AAPL is sharing the market with an increasingly diverse group of competitors, Apple Watch sales have not cratered. They were down overall for the year, but Apple maintained a dominant position and the new Apple Watch Series 2 did indeed propel the company to record smartwatch sales over the holidays.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceIs Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Ending the Age of Intel (INTC)?Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Steps on Amazon and Google's TurfThe postApple Inc.

Apple Inc. (AAPL) Could Be a Step Closer to Booting Intel From Macs;2/3/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIt's an idea that has been around for several years now: replace theIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) chips currently powering Mac computers with ARM chips fromARM Holdings plc (ADR)(NASDAQ:ARMH). Doing so would have many advantages forApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL). According to aBloombergreport, the prospect of ARM CPUs in Macs is getting closer, with AAPL working on a new chip that would independently control a MacBook's low power mode.makeArticleAd();Source: ARM HoldingsWhether you think it's a great idea or a head scratcher, theTouch Baris the tentpole feature of Apple's new MacBook Pro. The Touch Bar is an OLED strip that replaces the laptop's function keys with a programmable touch display, with virtual buttons based on the application currently being run. It also incorporates a fingerprint reader.And the Touch Bar is powered by the T1, Apple's first ARM-based Mac chip.New ARM CPUs in Macs?Bloombergis now reporting thatAAPL engineers are taking the next step toward ARM in Mac, by having the ""Power Nap"" mode controlled by an ARM chip. Power Nap is a feature that lets Mac laptops run basic background functions such as retrieving e-mail and installing software updates, while closed and sleeping. By shifting control of Power Nap from the Intel CPU to an ARM chip, less power is used and MacBook battery would last longer.Why the excitement about the possibility of Apple making a complete switch and replacing Intel processors with ARM CPUs in Macs?ARM in Mac: The PayoffsThere are many compelling reasons, includingthose laid out last yearby theMacObserver. ARM chips power all of Apple's mobile devices, so switching to ARM CPUs in Macs would simplify and unify code development between MacOS and iOS.10 Companies That Are Bringing Jobs Back to AmericaIntel has moved away from tick-tock processor development cycles, so it may not be moving forward fast enough for Apple's needs. Modern, 64-bit ARM processors are becoming competitive with Intel on power, including the power needed to run an operating system like Windows in a virtual environment; therefore, ARM in Mac wouldn't have to mean Macs lose the option to runMicrosoft Corporation's(NASDAQ:MSFT) Windows.Then there's cost. In a post dating back to 2015AppleInsiderbroke down thepotential financial gain should Apple ditch Intel. It estimated the cost of the A-series chips used in the iPhone and iPad at roughly $25, while Intel CPUs used in Macs were somewhere in the $180 to $300 range.The site points to the Apple TV as an example of Apple making the switch. The first generation ran a version of OS X on Intel processors. For the second generation, AAPL switched to an ARM-based A4 chip running iOS. That move shrunk the Apple TV size and knocked the price from $299 to $99. The numbers may have changed a little since then, but the same basic math applies: ARM is considerably cheaper.Will Apple Ditch Intel?There would be many risks in switching to ARM CPUs in Macs. Even if AAPL did make that decision, it would still need Intel CPUs for a number of years while it made the transition across the Mac product line - and Intel would be able to stick it to Apple for those chips. There would be challenges around integrating ARM chips with high-end graphics cards like those made byNvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA). Other third-party hardware would also require work.Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Has a New Hero: Services!There is also the issue of manufacturing capacity: AAPL's suppliers would need to be able to pick up the slack from Intel and churn out the needed ARM chips.However, as intense as all this sounds, it's worth remembering that AAPL has done it all before. Twice! The company transitioned the entire Mac platform from 68k to PowerPC in 1998, and then from PowerPC to Intel in 2005.ARM CPUs in Macs aren't a reality yet, but with the new ARM chips rumored for MacBooks, it seems as though AAPL is testing the waters. With Nvidia already causing it grief byturning its video cards into high-powered CPU-bustersand Microsoft once again trying for a version ofWindows on ARM processors, Intel has to be watching the ARM in Mac situation with more than a little consternation.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceMicrosoft Corporation (MSFT) Steps on Amazon and Google's TurfApple Inc.

Investors Turned 'Very Bullish' On Tech ETFs In January Amid Earnings;2/3/2017;"[ibd-display-video id=453308]ETF investors bet big on technology stocks ahead of earnings   reports from marquee names in January. Powered by demand for the   iPhone 7 Plus,Apple(AAPL) delivered supersize results on Jan. 31 and saw its shares   soar.Technology was the strongest S&P 500 sector in terms of   flow of money as the new year got underway, according to Sector   SPDRs. Investors last month poured $897.3 million into   Technology Select Sector SDPR (XLK), the largest and most active exchange traded fund for exposure   to this sector.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');This marked a significant reversal from 2016, when investors   yanked nearly $900 million from XLK for the year, said   Dan Dolan of Sector SPDRs. Trading activity in XLK so far   this year suggests thatETF   investorsare ""very bullish"" on the technology sector, in his view.""In addition to the flows, the short positions declined by   27%"" in January, Dolan told IBD via email. ""Earnings have been   very good,"" he pointed out, ""for most of the big names.""Those names includeMicrosoft(MSFT) andIntel(INTC) - tech stalwarts reinventing themselves for a new cloud-driven,   Internet of Things era - as well as chipmakersAdvanced Micro Devices(AMD),Texas Instruments(TXN),Microsemi(MSCC),Lam Research(LRCX) andKLA-Tencor(KLAC).Outliers includedAlphabet(GOOGL) andQualcomm(QCOM), which delivered mixed results.Tech earnings are tracking higher, at 9.6%, than the 6.6%   expected at the start of the Q4 season, according to CFRA   Research. And XLK's 4.3% year-to-date gain, vs. 1.8% for SPDR   S&P 500 (SPY), reflects investors's optimism   about improving industry fundamentals.[ibdchart symbol=""xlk"" type=""daily"" size=""quarter""   position=""leftchart"" ]While earnings season has put technology   companies under a spotlight, the macro outlook is   driving interest too.Technology stocks are expected to benefit from the economic   strength that tends to go hand-in-hand with periods of rising   interest rates.""As business spending picks up, as consumer confidence grows   and consumption increases, tech companies will be the   beneficiaries of those trends,"" said Todd Rosenbluth, director of   ETF research at CFRA. Other tailwinds include the promise of   corporate tax reform and repatriation of foreign cash under   President Trump, which disproportionately benefits the tech   sector, Rosenbluth pointed out.Apple CFO Luca Maestri noted   at Tuesday's earnings call that 94% of   his company's record $246.1 billion cash pile is stashed   abroad. Under a Trump proposal, the iPhone   maker could potentially bring home foreign earnings at   a special tax rate of 10%, instead of up to 35%. That tax holiday   could be one of the single biggest catalysts for the sector going   forward, CFRA analysts say.Risks to the sector include the uncertainty surrounding   Trump's vision for economic renewal, the crimp that a   strengthening dollar could put on global IT spending, and the   onslaught of low-cost rivals such as Huawei in key foreign   markets.Investors who remain bullish on the sector's outlook have four   dozen ETFs to choose from. Many of the new launches make   extremely focused bets in extremely small industry niches -   3D printing or Big Data or wearable devices, for example.In Rosenbluth's view, most investors would do well to stick   with a technology ETF offering broadly diversified exposure to   the sector, and to then layer on thematic ETFs in   specific tech industries.Investors have been seeking diversification. Two tech   ETFs far outpaced their peers last year by gathering more   than $1 billion apiece in fresh assets, and both hold a   broad basket of tech stocks. But they take markedly different   approaches to investing in the sector.Vanguard Information Technology (VGT) tracks a   market-cap-weighted index of U.S. tech companies,   including more small- and microcap stocks than most other   broad tech ETFs. It invests $10.75 billion in assets across 366   stocks for an extremely low 0.10% expense ratio.First Trust Nasdaq-100 Tech Sector (QTEC) follows an   equal-weighted index of Nasdaq-listed U.S. technology stocks. It   has virtually no exposure to small- and microcap stocks, but has   a significant midcap stake. At 0.60%, its expense ratio is among   the highest in the segment.Investors should be aware that ETFs may sound alike   but offer very different exposures, which affects their   performance, Rosenbluth says.QTEC rose 25% in 2016, nearly double the gains of its   Vanguard peer. It benefited in part from its extreme overweight   to the semiconductor industry.Looking ahead, Rosenbluth believes VGT may benefit more than   other broad-based peers from an improving U.S. economy,   given its larger stake in smaller tech companies.XLK and VGT made a 52-week high on thestock marketon Jan. 27.RELATED:High-Yield Strategy Uses 10 ETFs To Deliver     All-Weather Income With Low Risk7 Best ETFs For Your Growth And Income Needs As     Trump Takes The Wheel"

Warning: Don’t Sell Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Stock Short!;2/2/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsNvidia Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA), whose shares spiked 224% in 2016, has been lethal for short sellers. They lost a stunning$4.4 billion. And yes, it will probably still be bad for them to continue with their bearish bets on NVDA stock for the new year.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockNow short sellers are some of the world's best investors. If anything, they have to since the consequences of being wrong are so great! After all, a win for a short seller is if the stock goes to zero - which rarely happens. But as seen with Nvidia shares, the downside can be horrific.The irony is that short positions can provide tremendous fuel for price appreciation. Keep in mind that short sellers need to buy back shares to close out their positions.Something else to keep in mind: It's generally not a good strategy to take a short position merely because the valuation is excessive. There are many examples of companies - likeMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) in the 1980s and 1990s, orAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) during the past decade - that have sustained long bull runs. Wall Street is more than willing to place premiums on firms that can grow fast and with consistency.As for NVDA stock, the valuation is definitely pricey. Consider that the forward price-earnings ratio is roughly at 42! By comparison,Intel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) trades at 12.5 andQualcomm, Inc.(NASDAQ:QCOM) sports a multiple of 11.10 Stocks to Buy That Already Make America GreatBut, of course, NVDA is growing at breakneck speed. So over time the multiples will normalize as the earnings continue to build up. For example, in the latest quarter, Nvidia reporteda sizzling 54% spike in revenuesto $2 billion and GAAP earnings came to 83 cents a share, up 89%.The thing to keep in mind is that Nvidia is positioned nicely to benefit from various megatrends, which should provide lots of room for growth. The company's deep experience with graphics processing units (GPUs), which allow for intensive computations, is becoming the elixir for cloud computing, artificial intelligence, virtual reality, self-driving cars and gaming. All these markets are massive and on the verge of major changes.For example, according to a recentpresentationfrom Nvidia, the market opportunity for autos alone is at least $10 billion. And the company may be in the best position to benefit. The company has built a full platform for so-called AI car computing - called Nvidia Drive PX 2 - that uses high-performance chips and software to detect surroundings as well as determine optimal routes. Actually, there are over80 automakers that use the system, includingTesla Motors Inc(NASDAQ:TSLA).At the core of all of Nvidia's advantages in various large markets is the company's focus on AI. For the most part, GPUs have proven adept at this type of advanced computing, which allow for trillions of deep learning transactions per second. The result is that a system can quickly adapt and learn. So, this means a self-driving car will know where to turn or stop. Or it could mean that a corporate cloud system has the ability to understand important trends or risks.According toInvestorPlace'sBrad Moon:""Because the GPU is designed for one primary purpose - everything including computer graphics boils down to crunching numbers - NVDA is able to produce them at far lower cost than a CPU at an equivalent performance level, while producing less heat and using less power.""Great, right? Definitely.Valeant Pharmaceuticals Intl Inc (VRX) Has Only a Little Time LeftYet, this does not necessarily mean that the NVDA stock price will continue to rack up three-digit returns for years to come. No doubt, there will be lots of volatility. But again, when a company is at the forefront of tidal changes in technologies, taking a long-term bet often leads to nice market-beating returns.Tom Taulli runs the InvestorPlace blogIPO Playbookand is a registered investment adviser representative (you canvisit his siteto learn more about his financial planning services).He is also the author of various books on investing like All About Commodities, All About Short Selling and High-Profit IPO Strategies.Follow him on Twitter at@ttaulli.

Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA) Stock Has a Secret Weapon;2/2/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAlibaba Group Holding Ltd(NYSE:BABA) is often compared toAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN), which isn't always accurate. Most notably, Alibaba doesn't hold inventory like its larger U.S. peer, and it doesn't have AMZN's massive distribution capabilities. But, there is one notable similarity that doesn't seem priced into BABA stock at the moment:makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockA large, fast-growing cloud computing offering.Amazon's cloud business, called Amazon Web Services (AWS), has been a major factor in the rise of AMZN stock from less than $200 to more than $800 over the past five years.Alibaba Cloud is still much smaller, but its growth profile looks much like that of AWS back in 2011-12. That explosive growth - and the ability to be a legitimate competitor to Amazon.com andMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) - has the potential to drive significant additional upside in BABA stock.The Impact of Alibaba Cloud on BABA StockSo far, the cloud business hasn't done much for Alibaba's revenue, or BABA stock, for that matter. BABA still trades around $100, basically the same levels at which it went public in late 2014.Through the first nine months of fiscal 2016, cloud has generated just 3.3% of total revenue. Over the past four quarters, Alibaba's cloud sales total just $765 million - likely less than 6% of what AWS will create in calendar 2016. And at the moment, Alibaba's cloud business actually is a drag on BABA earnings. The business has lost $92 million in EBITA (not EBITDA; BABA uses EBITA for segment income) over the past four quarters.3 BRICS Buys That Play Banking, Buying and ... Beef?But the gap to Amazon and the losses in the business have more to do with Alibaba's relatively late start than with a lack of demand. Cloud revenue growth has been impressive, increasing 130% through the first nine months of fiscal 2016, and 115% in the December quarter, despite a pricing cut.That follows a 138% increase in cloud sales in fiscal 2016. Most impressively, the number of customers nearly doubled year-over-year in Q3, and BABA added 114,000 new customers in the December quarter alone.As for profitability, Alibaba isn't worried, yet, with management saying on the Q3 conference call it was spending to gain market share. Profitability will come, but for now, Alibaba is looking to cement its dominance of the lucrative Chinese market.Losses now are OK - AWS lost money until recently - because those new customers will provide high-margin recurring revenue going forward, possibly for decades.The Impact of Alibaba Cloud on BABA Stock Going ForwardThe good news for BABA stock is that it looks like the cloud business is nearing an inflection point. Losses are narrowing, but still represent a drag on overall earnings for BABA. Over the past 12 months, cloud has actually had a negative impact on EPS of about $0.03. That will change shortly, as Alibaba has said that the business will hit a profit around 1 million users, a milestone almost certain to be hit in 2017.The question is what happens after that. If Alibaba's growth looks anything like Amazon's going forward, it should be very positive for BABA stock.AMZN didn't break out cloud revenue until 2015; it appears that the business generated about $1 billion in sales in 2011 and $2 billion in 2012. That then grew to almost $4 billion in 2013, $5.6 billion in 2014, and $7.9 billion in 2015. 2016 growth to date suggests a figure over $12 billion in 2016. AWS is now estimated by analysts to be worth (on its own) about $150-$160 billion.Can Alibaba grow its cloud business to the same extent? Goldman Sachs analysts argued it could,projecting a valuefor Alibaba Cloud of $42 billion by 2019, based on $5 billion in sales. That growth alone would add almost 20% to the value of BABA stock over the next few years and it's not as outlandish as it seems.The Future Looks Bright for BABA StockGrowth rates have been over 100%, yet cloud computing is still relatively unknown in China. On the Q3 conference call, Alibaba CEO Daniel Zhang estimated that, even assuming pricing discounts to lure customers using hard drives, the addressable market for cloud in China would be $30 billion. And in November, Alibaba added new data centers in four locations worldwide: Sydney, Tokyo, Dubai and Germany.The concern might be whether a Chinese company will be able to compete internationally with Amazon and Microsoft. U.S. companies might prefer domestic providers, and elsewhere there could be worries about security.But, the reverse of that argument is that Alibaba should have a huge advantage in marketing to Chinese consumers, as those customers might be similarly unwilling to use American companies for their cloud services. Even with BABA now worth approximately $250 billion, the $30 billion Chinese market is more than enough to provide a material catalyst.3 Stocks to Buy for Better Deals Than the Great RecessionAWS profit margins already arenearing 25%despite its own spending in that business. Assuming Alibaba can get half of the Chinese market at 30% margins, the cloud segment could contribute as much as $1.50 per share in EPS annually, enough to add $30 billion-$40 billion in market value. Any international success would simply add to that value.Until now, the business hasn't been a focus of BABA stock investors, but that seems likely to change. When the company hits the 1 million mark and turns cloud profitable in 2017, coverage of the business should likely increase. And, further awareness of that driver seems equally likely to drive upside for BABA stock. Investors should consider getting long in Alibaba stock before the rest of the market figures that out.As of this writing, Vince Martin did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceThe 5 Best Stocks to Buy for Big Emerging Markets ProfitsThe Top 10 Dow Dividend Stocks for FebruarySears Holdings Corp (SHLD): A Great American Tragedy Nears Its EndThe postAlibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA) Stock Has a Secret Weaponappeared first onInvestorPlace."

3 Big Stock Charts for Thursday: Microsoft Corporation (MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) and Cincinnati Financial Corporation (CINF);2/2/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWe're still seeing a lot of weakness in the market as the earnings season is failing to add the spark that most investors were hoping for. While the aggregate bullish effect of the season hasn't been felt, there have been some stocks that are seeing opportunities to extend themselves higher likeMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) andAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN). On the other hand,Cincinnati Financial Corporation(NASDAQ:CINF) has found itself in a must-win situation ahead of next week's earnings results as the company's stock is barely hanging on to its long-term bullish trend.makeArticleAd();Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN)Amazon heads into the earnings confessional this afternoon as the stock sits near its highs around $850 technically teasing those looking at taking a position ahead of the numbers.The charts indicate that AMZN shares have become less overbought over the last week as the stock took a move towards its 20-day moving average. This move is very familiar to those of us that watch Amazon as it is a carbon copy of the pre-earnings activity last quarter.Today's AMZN chart is somewhat different and more supportive of the bulls as the stock is now shifting into an intermediate-term bull trend with the 50-day trendline crossing back over the 100-day. Our historical testing shows that Amazon stock is 63% more likely to outperform the at-any-time returns for the two months following this crossover.Volume on AMZN has dropped a little over the last week as we've seen traders back away ahead of the earnings. Call options on the stock have dropped in premium, suggesting that the options traders aren't expecting Amazon stock to knock the cover off of the ball this afternoon.7 High-Yield Stocks Ripe For A Short SqueezeThis adds up to breakout potential for the stock on an in-line report. The potential fly in the ointment would be the fact that MSFT is growing their Azure line of business. Watch for this to take a little away from the magic that has been AWS, Amazon's real driving force. Outside of that, the charts suggest a breakout on the way for AMZN.Cincinnati Financial Corporation (CINF)Last month, Cincinnati Financial shares took a hit on the exposure to the tragedy in Gatlinburg. Since then, CINF shares have spent their time consolidating and trying to place a tradable bottom, but there's a hanging issue.As of this week, all but the 200-day moving average have transitioned into a short- to intermediate-term bearish pattern. This means that Cincinnati Financial stock is likely to start feeling more pressure from the sellers again as overhead pressure builds.CINF chart watchers remember the significance of the $70-level last October. The shares took a decline to this level after an earnings report that failed to impress. Now, Cincinnati Financial prepares to report its quarterly results next Wednesday as the stock sits on this same critical chart support level. This makes the earnings announcement a ""must win"" for CINF.The 20-month moving average sits at $66.50, which is the line in the sand that long-term investors should be watching. A move to or below this level is going to spark additional selling as this stock has been one of the better performers in its peer group.Microsoft Corporation (MSFT)Again we get to cover Microsoft this week as the stock appears to be giving those patient traders an opportunity.Why Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock Should Expect Fireworks SoonMSFT shares rallied after a positive earnings announcement and took the shares to new all-time highs. After ringing that bell, the profiteers stepped in to lock in gains resulting in a near 5% drop in the Microsoft stock price.Technically, MSFT stock is now setting up for a nice short-term buying opportunity as it has worked off a technically overbought indication at the same time that it is nearing the 50-day moving average at $62.40.Since breaking above the 50-day in October, Microsoft stock has found significant buying interest on each test of the widely watched trendline. The last test, in December, resulted in an 8% rally over an 11-trading day period.Those looking to hold off and be patient can look for MSFT stock to head to the $60.50, which is the next site of trendline support at the 100-day. For now, our money is on a more shallow pullback to the 50-day holding as the more likely technical scenario to play out on Microsoft.As of this writing, Johnson Research Group did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceThe Top 10 Dow Dividend Stocks for February7 Awful Stocks You Need To Ditch Right AwayThe post3 Big Stock Charts for Thursday: Microsoft Corporation (MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc.

The International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) Stock Dip Beckons to Profit-Seekers;2/2/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTraders seeking strength are flocking to theNasdaqin droves. The tech-laden index continues to be the best looking of the bunch, and its dominance has only increased during earnings season. Solid performance fromApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) toMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) following their respective earnings releases has helped keep the good times rolling. But do you know which heavy hitter may be sporting the best opportunity right now?International Business Machines Corp.(NYSE:IBM).makeArticleAd();Source:Open Grid Scheduler Via FlickrLet's take a deep dive into the chart of IBM stock to see what kind of trade we can drum up.Like the lion's share of the equities market, IBM jumped into an uptrend following last year's election and it hasn't looked back since. The tech titan entered the new year with a solid high base pattern that created a breakout opportunity for technical traders.And they didn't have to wait long. Big Blue's earnings beat from Jan. 19 served as the excuse for buyers to come rushing in.The action in IBM stock since then has been textbook. After breaching the $170 resistance level, the stock gained a quick ten bucks before the bulls' fury finally faded.5 Safe Dividend Stocks to Buy for RetirementSince then, mild profit-taking has created an attractive four-day pullback. Traders loath to chase now have their opportunity to scoop up shares at a discount.Source: OptionsAnalytixRecent volume patterns have also been favoring buyers. The post-earnings breakout was accompanied by a handful of accumulation days suggesting institutions were entering the fray with aggression. And while the stock has retreated in recent days, the volume has been muted suggesting a lack of any real conviction by sellers here.Throw it all together, and this IBM stock dip looks like a buy.IBM Stock Calendars, Anyone?With earnings fading in the distance, IBM options have become cheap again. And that means long option trades carry much less risk. Let's build a calendar spread to capitalize on further upside in the stock over the coming month.First, buy to open the Apr $170 call for around $7.60. Then, sell to open the Mar $180 call for around $1.25. This creates a diagonal call spread for a net debit of $6.35. The max loss is limited to the initial debit and will be forfeited if IBM sits below $170 at Apr expiration.Why Sony Corp (ADR) (SNE) Stock Should Ditch the Entertainment BizTo minimize the loss, I suggest exiting if the stock breaks the $165 support level.The max profit is around $400 and will be captured if IBM sits right at $180 at March expiration. Since the April option will only have one month remaining at March expiration, I suggesting exiting at that point.At the time of this writing, Tyler Craig had no positions in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace5 Stocks to Buy to Defy a Weak FebruaryThe 5 Best Stocks to Buy for Big Emerging Markets ProfitsThe postThe International Business Machines Corp.

3 Naked Puts on High-ROI Stocks;2/2/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThis week I'm going to do something a little different as I discuss naked puts.

DLTR closed Wednesday at $76.39.By selling the 17 March $75 naked puts, assuming you get $3.10 per contract, you get a ""raw real return"" of 4.06%, which is calculated by dividing $3.10 by $76.39. Because the contract runs 44 days, that comes out to 33.7% annualized.Another way to calculate it is to assume DLTR stock is put to you, but that the stock is purchased using margin. Most brokers have a 35% margin requirement for an effective short positions - an amount set aside to partially cover the cost of a potential purchase. So 35% of the total purchase price if DLTR were put to you is $2,625. Thus, what I would call the ""gross ROI"" would be $310 divided by $2,625, or 11.81%.Naked Puts: Starbucks (SBUX)Source:Javier González Via FlickrGross ROI is just another way to compare option trades. Let's look at another example with it and raw real return forStarbucks Corporation(NASDAQ:SBUX).SBUX stock has fallen the past few days on earnings results that annoyed some people, but it's a long-term story and it means being able to get the stock at a cheaper price with naked puts.SBUX closed Wednesday at $53.90. The 10 March $54 naked puts are selling for about $1.10. So the raw real return here is 2.04%, which comes out to 20.1% on an annualized basis.3 ""Left for Dead"" Stocks Making a ComebackTaking our 35% margin requirement on a $5,400 purchase, we come out to $1,890. Dividing $110 into $1,890 gives us a gross ROI of 5.82%.Naked Puts: Microsoft (MSFT)Source:Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified)Finally, look atMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT), which closed at $63.58 on Wednesday. The 10 March $63.50 naked puts are selling for $1.35. On a raw real return basis that comes out to 2.12%, or 20.9% on an annualized basis. A 35% margin requirement on a $6,350 purchase is $2,222. So our gross ROI is 6.07%.Now, compare all three. Note that the more volatile stock, DLTR, offers a higher premium but also sells at a higher price. Even though DLTR stock is only $13 more expensive than MSFT stock, or about 20%, and the contract is only one week longer, the premium sells for 130% more, thus creating a higher gross ROI.SBUX stock is about 20% cheaper than MSFT stock, yet both its raw real return and gross ROI are about the same. The purpose of this exercise is just to show a different way to calculate a return should a stock get put to you, and you elect to actually purchase it instead of just buying back the naked position.Lawrence Meyers is the CEO of PDL Capital, and manager of the forthcomingLiberty Portfolio stock newsletter.

"Microsoft Sells ""Thousands"" of HoloLens -- What Now?";2/2/2017;"Microsoft's(NASDAQ: MSFT) HoloLens -- a ""mixed reality"" headset which   projects virtual and augmented reality ""holograms"" on real   objects -- captured the attention of many gadget enthusiasts last   year, but the development kit's$3,000 price tagkept it mostly in the hands of serious developers.However, Microsoft recently announced that  it had sold   ""thousands"" of HoloLens units since last March -- indicating that   developer base was growing. Let's take a look at what lies in   store for the HoloLens this year, and when a cheaper   consumer-facing model might finally arrive.Image source: Microsoft.makeArticleAd();The Windows 10 Creators UpdateUnder CEO Satya Nadella, Microsoft has gradually built a ""One   Windows"" ecosystem in which various devices are connected by a   single operating system, app store, and cloud platform. HoloLens   will play a crucial role in tethering ""mixed reality"" users to   that ecosystem via Windows 10.The first major step toward that integration will be the    Windows 10 Creators Update this spring. That update will   add 3D image capture and editing tools, which will enable artists   and developers to create 3D objects which can be viewed in   HoloLens. That learning curve sounds steep, but Microsoft claims   that the tools will be so simple that they can be used by   12-year-olds. Doing so could help Microsoft attract more   developers to make Windows 10 and HoloLens a truly ""holographic""   combination.The virtual reality training wheelsLast October, Microsoft announced that it would  launchVR headsetsthat could track a user's head rotation and position without   using external sensors likeFacebook's(NASDAQ: FB) Oculus Rift andHTC's Vive. Like the Rift and Vive, Microsoft's VR headsets will be   tethered to PCs.But Microsoft's headsets will start at just $300 --   significantly undercutting the Rift and Vive's respective price   tags of $600 and $800. Microsoft also claims that the headsets   will work on mid-range PCs, which could pull PC gamers away from   the Rift and Vive. Microsoft won't manufacture these headsets on   its own. Instead, it will rely on hardware partners likeHP,Lenovo,Dell,Asus, andAcerto launch the devices.These headsets will notably use similar voice and gesture   commands as the HoloLens. This means that they could serve as   cheaper ""training wheels"" for the HoloLens -- so the controls   feel more familiar when the commercial version finally   arrives.More retail and enterprise partnershipsMicrosoft has been boosting the HoloLens' public exposure with   several retail partnerships.Volvouses the HoloLens to let consumers ""virtually"" customize their   dream cars in augmented reality -- regardless of a dealer's   in-store inventory. That virtual customization helps dealers   minimize inventory space to reduce real estate expenses.The HoloLens being used at a Volvo dealership. Image source:     Microsoft.Home improvement retailerLowe'slets customers use the  HoloLens to view changes to   their homes in virtual reality. Microsoft will likely sign   similar retail partnerships this year, since they help both   retailers and customers understand the practical uses of   HoloLens' mixed reality features.Microsoft has also signed enterprise deals with several   companies to test the HoloLens' effectiveness in the workplace.   Its integration withAutodesk360 helps designers create hologram versions of their   designs, and its partnership withTrimblestreamlines communications for construction workers and   provides them with 3D visualizations of their projects.Japan Airlinesalso used the headset to train mechanics and flight crew members   last  year. That list will likely grow this year if the   Creators Update whets companies' appetite for holographic   applications.But don't expect a consumer release in 2017Microsoft is laying down the foundations for the HoloLens, but   consumers shouldn't expect a cheaper version of the device to   arrive this year. Alex Kipman, who oversees the development of   the HoloLens, recently toldCNETthat he doesn't expect hardware prices to significantly decline   anytime soon. Kipman admitted that ""roadmaps"" for getting the   price under $1,000 exist, but he declined to share any additional   details.It's very common for a device to have a long waiting time   between developer kit releases and the commercial launch. Oculus,   for example, released the first dev kit of the Rift in March   2013. The commercial version didn't arrive until three years   later. Therefore, we could still need to wait averylong time before a cheaper HoloLens arrives.10 stocks we like better than MicrosoftWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Symantec (SYMC) Tops on Q3 Earnings, Down on Tepid View;2/2/2017;"Symantec CorporationSYMCreported third-quarter fiscal 2017 results. The company's adjusted earnings (excluding deferred revenues fair value, amortization, restructuring and other one-time items but including stock-based compensation) of 22 cents per share came a penny ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate. On a year-over-year basis, it remained flat.Furthermore, on a non-GAAP basis, Symantec's earnings came in at 32 cents per share, which not only came ahead of its own guidance range of 27 cents to 29 cents but also marked a year-over-year increase of 23%. The year-over-year improvement in non-GAAP earnings was mainly driven by increased sales.Despite a strong bottom-line performance, shares of Symantec fell approximately 4% in yesterday's after-hour trade as the company's top-line results and fourth quarter revenue outlook fell short of analysts' expectations.Nonetheless, the stock has outperformed the Zacks categorizedComputer-Softwareindustry in the year-to-date period. Symantec shares gained 11% in the said period while the industry's gain was just 5.6%.Quarter in DetailSymantec's revenues of $1.041 billion increased 14.5% year over year mainly driven by strong performance at the company's Enterprise Security segment. However, it fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.085 billion.Nonetheless, adjusted for deferred revenues fair value, revenues were $1.088 billion compared with $909 million in the year-ago quarter. Moreover, the company's non-GAAP revenues were above the mid-point of its own guidance $1.070 billion to $1.090 billion (mid-point: $1.080 billion).Segment-wise, the Consumer Security division witnessed a 4% year-over-year decline in revenues, while revenues at Enterprise Security increased 30% on a year-over-year basis. Moreover, adjusted for deferred revenues fair value, Enterprise Security revenues surged 40%.Symantec's adjusted gross profit of $917 million was up 19.7%, primarily attributable to a higher revenue base and lower cost of goods sold. Consequently, as a percentage of revenues, gross margin improved 380 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis to 86.9%.Furthermore, adjusted operating income increased 8.3% year over year to $234 million, as the benefits from increased revenues and lower cost of goods sold were partially offset by a 24.2% jump in adjusted operating expenses. Consequently, adjusted operating margin contracted 130 bps year over year to 22.5%.On a non-GAAP basis, operating income grew 30.3% year over year to $331 million while margin improved 250 bps to 30.4%. Moreover, non-GAAP operating margin was higher than the company's guidance range of 27% to 28%.The better-than-expected margin was mainly driven by strong top-line growth and realization of cost savings ahead of time. As per Symantec, it remains on track to realize over $200 million of cost savings in fiscal 2017 through its cost restructuring initiatives and synergies from the newly acquired business, Blue Coat.Adjusted net income for the quarter came in at $136.6 million compared with $151.6 million in the year-ago quarter. However, on per share basis, adjusted earnings per share were flat year over year at 22 cents as a lower numerator was offset by a lower denominator.Balance Sheet & Cash FlowSymantec exited the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $5.575 billion, compared with $5.619 billion last quarter. Long-term debt was $6.358 billion, down from $6.576 billion in the previous quarter.During the first three quarters of 2016, Symantec used operating cash flow of $573 million. Moreover, it paid $173 million as dividend during the period.GuidanceSymantec did not provide any update on the fiscal 2017 guidance. It should be noted that during the second-quarter earnings release, the company had reiterated its non-GAAP revenue guidance but raised its non-GAAP operating margin and earnings per share outlook for fiscal 2017. For fiscal 2017, Symantec still expects revenues in a range of $4.040 billion to $4.120 billion (mid-point $4.08 billion). Non-GAAP operating margin is now anticipated in a range of 27% to 29% (previously 26%-28%). Non-GAAP earnings per share are now expected to be $1.12 to $1.18 (previously $1.08 to $1.14).However, it provided guidance for the fourth quarter. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, Symantec expects GAAP and non-GAAP revenues in a range of $1.039 billion - $1.059 billion (mid-point $1.049 billion) and $1.070 billion - $1.090 billion (mid-point $1.080 billion), respectively. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.11 billion.GAAP and non-GAAP operating margin is projected in a range of 1%-3% and 27%-29%, respectively. Management expects to report a breakeven to loss of 2 cents on a GAAP basis for the fourth quarter. However, on a non-GAAP basis, it expects earnings between 27 cents and 29 cents.LifeLock AcquisitionDuring the third quarter of fiscal 2017, Symantec entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Arizona-based LifeLock Inc.LOCKfor $2.3 billion. The company anticipates completing the acquisition on Feb 9.In connection with this, the company yesterday announced raising $1 billion in aggregate principal amount by issuing senior unsecured notes due 2025.In our opinion, the acquisition will be a strategic fit for Symantec, which is trying hard to expand its business in the high growth area of next-generation cybersecurity. The acquisition will help Symantec enhance its capabilities in identity protection, which is currently a huge concern for almost every sector, be it financials, retail or technology.Symantec expects the LifeLock acquisition to contribute about $100 million in revenues and around $9 million of non-GAAP earnings before interest and taxes in the fourth quarter. However, the benefits will not impact its net income as these will be offset by incremental interest expenses from the debt used to fund the transaction.Our TakeSymantec reported modest third-quarter results wherein its bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate but the top line missed the same. However, the company exceeded its own guidance on all metrics.Symantec Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS     SurpriseSymantec Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS   Surprise|Symantec Corporation QuoteAccording to Symantec CFO, Nick Noviello, ""Our third quarter results exceeded our constant currency revenue, operating margin, and EPS guidance. In just two quarters since combining Symantec and Blue Coat we are tracking ahead of schedule on product integrations, cost savings and synergies. We are pleased to be increasing our fiscal year 2017 financial outlook.""Investment in growth areas such as Enterprise Backup, Storage Management and Security businesses are expected to boost Symantec's long-term prospects. Moreover, restructuring initiatives and synergies from acquisitions are expected to support its bottom line.Nonetheless, we are disappointed by the company's fourth quarter revenue guidance, which fell short of our estimate. Furthermore, the company's announcement of issuing another $1 billion of senior notes to fund the acquisition of LifeLock will increase its interest expenses, thereby negatively impacting its bottom-line going forward.Moreover, smaller companies like Kaspersky are consistently launching comparable products. These, along with competition from the likes of MicrosoftMSFT, remain headwinds. The uncertainty over PC sales adds to its woes.Currently, Symantec carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A better-ranked stock in the computer software space is Check Point SoftwareCHKP, sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks   here.The stock has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice while matching the same once in the trailing four quarters.

The Clock Ticks Down to the Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) Acquisition;2/2/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsI'm increasingly confident thatYahoo! Inc.'s(NASDAQ:YHOO) acquisition byVerizon Communications Inc.(NYSE:VZ) is going to close only a little behind schedule.makeArticleAd();Source:Christian Barmala Via FlickrYes, the online superpower is facing an SEC investigation into why management waited years to let the world know their billion-user database had been hacked. But those managers and the compliance systems the regulators want to test are unlikely to stick around once VZ stock takes its prize.Troubles for YHOO Stock?The SEC investigation doesn't seem like it will become the kind of juicy probe into fraud that can bring a company to its knees. All the regulators really want to know is whether the timing of the hack announcement left outside investors at a disadvantage.Based on price action since we all found out that YHOO security was compromised several years ago, I'd say the gun just isn't smoking. Management confessed that the database had been accessed back in September, when the stock was trading at a comfortable $44.15. Today, shares are priced around $45, so any investor harm here is minimal at best.The Top 10 Dow Dividend Stocks for FebruaryWhat we're left with is a deal timeline that is pushed back only a few months. Given the complexity of YHOO stock's media architecture, a merger like this takes time to do right, so I'm actually pleased to see a few delays.And they're almost certain to be just delays and not any kind of hard stop. This deal made sense before the investigation, and it still makes sense now.YHOO's business may have flattened out, but Verizon isn't interested in building a business organically from the ground up. They're already running a $200 billion juggernaut that has stopped growing on its own. Bolting YHOO onto that chassis could help earn VZ stock 4%-5% of top-line growth in the first year after the deal closes. That's enough to keep shareholders happy in the near term.From there, it's a matter of strategic execution.VZ stock has ambitious media plans, and I think the ongoing presence of theHuffington Postproves that the company is dedicated to building an empire of online content. Granted, YHOO itself hasn't been growing that fast lately - revenue stalled last quarter - but that's what happens when managers brace for a transition - plans get mothballed, ideas get filed away, and the innovation cycle pauses.Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock: Buy This Old Dog for Its New TricksWhether it gets back to work down the road is up to the new managers. In the meantime, it's likely that the processes which facilitated the security breach at Yahoo will go away as the acquisition unfolds.Verizon has its own account security, and moments like this are a traditional opportunity to let IT managers on both sides take the best overall solution for the larger enterprise and let the weaker systems go.Hilary Kramer is the editor ofGameChangers,Breakout Stocks,High Octane Trader,Absolute Capital ReturnandValue Authority.

3 Tech Stocks Paying Better Dividends Than Apple;2/2/2017;"Technology stocks, once the domain of high-flying growth investors, are becoming an increasingly generous source of dividends for income investors. The information technology sector led the market by total dividends paid both for the third quarter of 2016 and for the 12 months that ended September 30, according to a FactSet analysis of the 419 dividend payers in Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. Apple (symbolAAPL) was tops in the IT sector, paying $12.2 billion in dividends over the 12-month stretch.But just because Apple handed out the most money to its shareholders doesn't mean it's the best source of income in the sector. In fact, Apple's stock currently yields just 1.8%, even less than the S&P 500's 2.1%. So we set out to find mature tech stocks with solid business outlooks that offer superior yields to Apple. Our search turned up three blue-chip names. How blue? Like Apple, all three of our picks are components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Take a look.makeArticleAd();Cisco SystemsCisco Systems, which makes the routers, switches and modems that form the backbone of the internet, is poised for better-than-expected sales growth, analysts say. A recent survey of its customers by UBS Securities revealed that spending on Cisco products remains a top budgetary priority. The tech company gets good marks for being easy to work with, and two-thirds of respondents said it has the best overall security offering. The growth of cloud-based computing (storing data and applications on remote servers) and the Internet of Things (the expanding digital interconnectivity of everyday items, from cars to refrigerators) are long-term tailwinds for the company and the stock. UBS has a ""buy"" rating on Cisco shares.Analysts, on average, expect Cisco's earnings to rise by just a penny this fiscal year ending July 30, to $2.37 from $2.36, according to a survey by Thomson Reuters. Sales are forecast to slip 1.9% in fiscal 2017. The more bullish case for Cisco stems from projections for the following fiscal year (ending in July 2018), when profits are projected to climb 5% to $2.49 a share, and revenue is expected to gain 2.4%.Cisco's dividend, which dates back to 2011, has increased annually. The company disbursed $5 billion in common dividends for the 12 months ended Oct. 31. That was supported by $12 billion in free cash flow, or cash left over after spending the money required to operate and expand the business.SEE ALSO:10 Stocks Every Retiree Should OwnIntelConsumers are increasingly forgoing desktop computers for mobile devices. As a result, PC sales have become a slowly melting iceberg. Market research firm Gartner found that PC sales fell for eight consecutive quarters as of the third quarter of 2016. That has forced Intel, the world's largest maker of the central processing units that serve as a PC's brain, to find new ways to generate revenue growth.The expansion of cloud-based services has been a boon to Intel, thanks to its market-share dominance in server chips. True, Intel faces changes in customer demands and competition from rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), but analysts at Stifel say it's responding well. ""Intel has been acquiring technologies and recruiting outside managerial talent to prepare for the changing market,"" Stifel analyst Kevin Cassidy, who rates Intel shares a ""buy,"" said in a recent note to clients.Analysts expect 2017 earnings to rise to $2.79 from $2.72 a share in 2016, according to Thomson Reuters. Revenue is forecast to increase 1% to $60.1 billion. Intel paid its first cash dividend in 1992, and the company resumed annual dividend hikes two years ago. Intel's payout ratio, or dividends as a percentage of earnings, is a conservative 37% and below even the S&P 500's average ratio of 40%.SEE ALSO:3 Reasons to Own Apple Stock in RetirementMicrosoftMicrosoft is another tech company that's benefiting from the rise in cloud computing. An increasing number of customers now pay a recurring subscription fee to use its software rather than purchasing it outright. It's proving to be a hot area of growth. ""The closely watched commercial cloud business -- which includes Office 365, Azure and Dynamics 365 -- continued to grow at a torrid rate, reaching over $14.0 billion in annualized revenue in the second quarter [which ended December 31, 2016],"" William Blair & Co. analyst Jason Ader said in a recent note to clients.Importantly, the analyst expects Microsoft to become more profitable over time because of its ""disproportionate growth in its commercial cloud business, which is being boosted by rapid customer adoption of Office 365 and Azure."" Azure is Microsoft's cloud-computing platform, and Office 365 is the subscription version of its popular Office applications. Cloud-based services can have higher profit margins than traditional licensed software.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters project earnings to rise to $2.97 a share for the current fiscal year ending June 30, from $2.79 in fiscal 2016. Revenue for fiscal 2017 is expected to increase 4.9% year over year, to $96.5 billion. For its second quarter, which ended December 31, Microsoft generated $1.3 billion in free cash flow after disbursing $3 billion worth of dividends. The company has paid a dividend to its shareholders since 2003. By contrast, Apple resumed paying a regular quarterly dividend only in 2012, following a 17-year layoff.SEE ALSO:10 Best Dividend-Paying Stocks for 2017"

Will Microsoft's $1 Billion Cybersecurity Play Hurt Smaller Players?;2/1/2017;"Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) recently announced that  it will invest over   $1 billion per year on cybersecurity research and development.   That amount, which is equivalent to roughly 8% of its R&D   spend over the past 12 months, doesn't include any acquisitions   that Microsoft might make. Let's see why Microsoft is beefing up   its cybersecurity efforts, and what that could mean for smaller   players across the fragmented industry.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();What cybersecurity means to MicrosoftMicrosoft's Windows is the most widely used PC operating   system in the world, Office is the  most popular   productivity suite, and Azure is the second largest cloud   platform in the world afterAmazon's(NASDAQ: AMZN) AWS. Much of this massive ecosystem has   traditionally been protected by third party companies.   Microsoft's own products -- like Windows Firewall, Windows   Defender, and Microsoft Security Essentials -- were  often   considered inferior to third-party ones.However, Microsoft's ecosystem has become more cohesive under   CEO Satya Nadella's ""One Windows"" strategy, which aims to install   the same OS and app store across multiple platforms. Since users   would ideally download apps from the Windows Store and deliver   their data to Cortana and Bing via Azure, it would be logical to   add first-party, self-updating security solutions across the   entire ecosystem. Microsoft claims that the number of weekly   cyber attacks has risen from 20,000 to as many as 700,000 over   the past two to three years.To counter those threats while expanding its ecosystem,   Microsoft acquired three Israeli cybersecurity firms over the   past two years -- enterprise security start-up Aorato, cloud   security firm Adallom, and data protection firmSecure Islands. Those acquisitions and its planned R&D investments could   help Azure challenge AWS, which already integrates an    arsenal of security features into its cloud infrastructure   platform. Azure's revenue surged 93% annually last quarter, but   Microsoft hasn't revealed its exact sales figures yet.How this could hurt smaller playersAs Microsoft's cybersecurity ecosystem grows, it could overlap   with the services of many smaller stand-alone third-party   players. For example, Microsoft recently  launched Windows   Defender ATP (Advanced Threat Protection) for Windows 10. That   endpoint service matches events with Microsoft's cloud-based   Security Graph, which gathers data across over a billion Windows   devices worldwide. It also works with Microsoft's email   protection services from Office 365 and Microsoft Advanced Threat   Analytics.This platform directly competes against ""perimeter"" players   like threat prevention firmFireEye(NASDAQ: FEYE) and next-gen firewall vendorPalo Alto Networks(NYSE: PANW) . During last year's RSA Conference, Microsoft   principal research lead Tanmay Ganacharya toldDark Readingthat Windows Defender ATP can ""help capture network traffic out   of a given endpoint"", so that it could ""detect the same attacks""   as FireEye and other threat detection services.Consider what $1 billion means to these smaller cybersecurity   companies. Palo Alto and FireEye are expected to respectively   generate $1.8 billion and $720 million in revenues this year --   so there's no way that they could match Microsoft's R&D   investments. Windows, Office 365, Azure, Dynamics, and other   platforms all give Microsoft the ability to bundle and scale up   its cybersecurity services very quickly. It can also offer lower   prices and offset those losses across other parts of its   ecosystem.But ""best in breed"" cybersecurity firms could still     surviveMicrosoft's growing interest in the cybersecurity market could   render some smaller players obsolete, but ""best in breed"" players   like FireEye and Palo Alto have survived similar assaults from   bundled players before.Cisco(NASDAQ: CSCO) , for example, has aggressively bundled threat   prevention and next-gen firewalls into its networking hardware   and software. Yet FireEye still serves 5,000 customers across 67   countries, which includes nearly half of the Forbes Global 2000.   Palo Alto serves over 35,500 customers in more than  140   countries, including 80 of the Fortune 100 and half of the Global   2000.Those numbers indicate that companies will likely value a   company's track record and reputation over the convenience of   cheaper bundles. They also indicate that it could be smarter for   Microsoft to either acquire or partner with smaller stand-alone   players instead of trying to render them obsolete.The key takeawayBeefing up its cybersecurity business will help Microsoft   counter Amazon and tighten up its ""One Windows"" ecosystem. While   some of the new features seem destined to crush third-party   security players, investors should remember that companies will   likely stick with ""best in breed"" players instead of the cheapest   bundle, and a mass switch to a new security platform can be   costly and time consuming.Therefore, investors in cybersecurity companies should be   mindful of Microsoft's ambitions, but they should remember that   many ""best in breed"" companies have weathered similar attacks   from companies like Cisco before.10 stocks we like better than MicrosoftWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock: Buy This Old Dog for Its New Tricks;2/1/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsCompanies likeMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) are rare for a reason. You can call it the Polaroid effect: Scientist and inventor Edwin H. Land's idea for a light polarizing lens sparked multiple innovations, includinginstant photography.makeArticleAd();Source:Johannes Marliem Via FlickrTogether with businessman George Wheelwright, Land formed Polaroid in 1937. Land and Wheelwright completely dominated the instant photography sector, until that sector was no longer relevant. Once considered an economic bellwether,Polaroiddeclared bankruptcyin 2001.True, the company is back on the wheel again, but not before taking down its original investors. Worst of all, they're an afterthought. Polaroid is seemingly stuck in a reality that hasseen its zenith30 years ago. It's a fate that anyone vested in MSFT stock will obviously want to avoid. Still, it is a legitimate fear, especially among technology companies. In this day and age, if you're not ahead, you're almost intractably behind.MSFT Stock Is Getting the Job DoneBased on its most recent second-quarterearnings report, Microsoft stock is in good hands. On a year-over-year basis, earnings grew 3.6%, matching consensus estimates for 79 cents per share. Top-line sales increased by a 2.2% margin over the year-ago level, which slightly exceeded forecasts. While InvestorPlace writer Tom Taulli is correct in pointing out that these aren't earth-shattering figures for MSFT stock, they're more than good enough.I've made the argument before that Microsoft stock issteady, not sexy- and that's not a bad thing. Sure, everybody lovesFerrari N.V.(NYSE:RACE) and its incredible machines. Rarely do people rave when they have to spend an inordinate amount of time in the shop. I'm not suggesting that MSFT stock is the market equivalent of a minivan; what I am saying is that it's not going to pull too many unwanted surprises.Take a look at the broader picture of its earnings performances. In the past fourteen quarters inclusive of the latest Q2, MSFT shares have only failed to meet earnings consensus twice. Of those misses, the negative surprise averaged 6% below forecast. While that's a notable ding, the total average earnings surprise for Microsoft stock in the aforementioned time frame is well over 8%.No matter how you look at it, that's a respectable trend. It's especially true given that MSFT is an old dog with fierce rivals chomping at the bit.Microsoft Is Still in the Innovation GameCEO Satya Nadella has made it no secret that he wants MSFT stock to be more than just a play on software and computers. To that end, the company has been investing heavily in cloud applications. It's a market that is projected to jump from last year's$204 billionto$318 billionin two years' time.Unfortunately, it's a market that has stiff opposition for Microsoft stock. Public enemy number one isAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), which commands air superiority in the cloud.SAP SE (ADR)(NYSE:SAP),International Business Machines Corp.(NYSE:IBM) andOracle Corporation(NYSE:ORCL) are big league players that are eager to make their presence known. Certainly, they're not going to make the ride easy for those vested in MSFT shares.This, however, is one of those areas where being an old dog has its advantages. Primarily, MSFT stock carries the leverage of a ubiquitous, utilitarian brand. While SAP and Oracle have powerful cloud applications, chances are, unless you're a business analyst for a Fortune 500 company, you're not going to be too familiar with their platforms. Even Amazon has a little bit of a vulnerability in this area, considering that it's mostly used as an e-commerce function.For Microsoft stock, it's all about selling the trust factor. Everybody - from the high school student writing a research paper to experts from all industries -knows MSFT's platform. Many of us have literally grown up with the company. Already, there's an entire generation of workers that have known nothing but Microsoft Windows' graphical user interface.MSFT Is Backed by Smart MovesThis familiarity definitely carries substance to it. Back in January of 2014 - after the ""One Microsoft"" brand message was launched - the tech giant became themost trustedcompany according to a brand survey conducted by Forrester Research. Beating outApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), this ledForresteranalyst Tracy Stokes to conclude that Microsoft ""has a utilitarian essentiality, not the kind of emotional essentiality that Apple relies on.""Although the remarks were made three years ago, they're still spot on today. For example, Microsoft's acquisition of LinkedIn gives it an incredible professional network: LinkedIn has467 million usersand 128 million in the U.S. - roughly 40% of our total national population. Better yet for MSFT stock, that 40% represents the company's target audience - tech savvy, money-making individuals.Here's Why General Electric Company (GE) Stock Will Definitely Gain 20%-PlusTo be sure, Microsoft has a lot of challenges. Obviously, the personal computer segment isn't doing anyone any favors. At the same time, investors in MSFT shares don't have to worry about thePolaroideffect. Management is making smart moves that are paying dividends - literally and figuratively.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceThe 5 Best Stocks to Buy for Big Emerging Markets Profits3 Stocks to Buy for Better Deals Than the Great RecessionThe postMicrosoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock: Buy This Old Dog for Its New Tricksappeared first onInvestorPlace."

What Apple's (AAPL) Earnings Say About The Future;2/1/2017;"When you regularly give your opinion on something as unpredictable as financial markets, gloating when you get something right is rarely a good idea. That is especially true when those opinions arearchivedfor all to see; it's too easy for a reader to check out that archive and find examples of when the market and hindsight combine to make even logical arguments seem foolish. I am fully aware of that, but when it comes to yesterday’searnings release from Apple(AAPL), I will still say""told you!""What really matters about the Apple release to investors is certainly not that I got it right, nor is it even that the tech giant returned to growth in revenue for the first time in a year, nor that the already great margins at Apple increased. Those last two are important, but necessarily backward looking, as all hard data in an earnings release are by definition.What matters most is what the report tells us about the future and there the message was somewhat mixed.makeArticleAd();The official guidance for Q1 2017 contained in the release fell just short of Wall Street’s expectations, which would normally be enough of a negative to more than offset the good historical results. In this case, though, a look at where Apple succeeded in Q4 2016 suggests that that guidance may just be another example of Apple’s past tendency to err on the side of under-promising and over-delivering when it comes to guidance. That is why, even though growth stalled last year, AAPL has beaten EPS expectations in three of the last four quarters.First and foremost, iPhone sales hit another record. That is particularly significant as not that long ago many were predicting that Google parent Alphabet (GOOG:GOOGL)’s move into the phone business would do Apple some serious harm. It looks now as if those saying that were about as accurate as those that maintained that the Windows phone from Microsoft (MSFT) or the Amazon (AMZN) Fire phone would be the next big thing.The fact is that the iPhone has an iconic status that looks almost impossible to challenge. Even phones that are objectively better in some ways, such as memory capacity, camera resolution, or speaker quality for example, cannot take market share. As Apple advances the iPhone with each release, beating them on those and other fronts becomes harder, but remains, according to the evidence so far, a pointless exercise. As long as that dynamic remains, holding Apple stock and adding to holdings at times of weakness still makes sense for investors.The weakness in this release was mainly in one area; iPad sales declined for the twelfth successive quarter. That, however, was offset to some extent by strong sales of Macs and Apple Watches. For the latter we are reliant on the word of Tim Cook as Apple doesn’t release a breakdown of watch sales, but, as I pointed out in the article referenced above, anybody who tried to buy a Series Two watch as a Christmas gift is probably aware that sales were at least more than Apple expected. None were available in any of the five states where I tried and most stores have just now received inventory.That shortage of watches, combined with Cook’s admission that they seriously underestimated demand for the iPhone 7 Plus, means that the record sales reported yesterday were achieved with a background of supply constraints. Given that and the fact that there was considerable growth in areas such as services and enterprise operations that still have lots of room for Apple to expand, the message underlying yesterday’s earnings is that, despite conventional wisdom, growth can still be achieved."

Advanced Micro (AMD) Q4 Loss In Line, View Disappoints;2/1/2017;"Advanced Micro DevicesAMDreported loss of 4 cents per share in fourth-quarter 2016, which matched the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Revenues increased 15.4% year over year to $1.11 billion primarily driven by higher GPU sales. However, revenues decreased 15.4% sequentially, primarily due to seasonally soft sales figures for its semi-custom System on Chips (SoCs). Notably, revenues were well above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.07 billion.AMD's shares rose 1.2% in after-hour trading. We note that shares have outperformed the ZacksElectronics Semiconductorsindustry over the last one year. While the industry gave a positive return of 67.2%, AMD gained a whopping 384.6%.The company benefited from strong demand for its graphics products. However, AMD's first-quarter 2017 will be impacted by seasonal weakness.RevenuesAdvanced Micro has two reportable segments -Computing and Graphics(focused on the traditional PC market) andEnterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom(focusing on adjacent high-growth opportunities). The details of these segments are discussed below:Computing and Graphics includes desktop and notebook processors and chipsets, discrete GPUs and professional graphics. This segment accounted for 54.2% of revenues and was up 27.1% sequentially and 27.7% year over year to $600 million.Notably, this segment's revenues grew on an annualized basis for the first time since 2011 as AMD's increased efforts to strengthen this particular segment paid off.Also, the segment posted the highest revenue in the last two years. Client revenues were the highest in the last seven quarters. Graphics processor revenues were also the highest in the last 11 quarters.During the reported quarter, strong adoption of the company's seventh generation notebook accelerated processing units (APUs) drove growth for the company. While desktop processor sales improved on a sequential basis, it declined on a year-over-year basis.The company also won a number of high-end design deals with global original equipment manufacturers over its Ryzen desktop processor that is expected to be launched in early Mar 2017.AMD's Polaris line of GPUs witnessed increased adoption in the fourth quarter. Also, Radeon Pro 400 mobile GPUs were launched, which are used in Apple'sAAPLpremium segment notebooks.The Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment includes server and embedded processors, dense servers, semi-custom SoC products, engineering services and royalties. This segment brought in the remaining 45.8% of revenues, down 39.4% sequentially but up 3.7% year over year to $506 million.The year-over-year increase was driven by higher sales of embedded processor sales and game consoles by MicrosoftMSFTand Sony that are powered by AMD's chips.The segment witnessed increased adoption in targeted markets. Notably, the company continues to gain traction in Naples, Italy.Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS   SurpriseAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. Price, Consensus and   EPS Surprise|Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. QuoteOperating ResultsNon-GAAP gross margin (excluding Wafer Supply Agreement (WSA) charges) was 31.7%, which expanded a whopping 494% sequentially but only 24% on a year-over-year basis.Adjusted operating expenses of $354 million increased 0.6% sequentially and 6.6% year over year.Non-GAAP operating loss was $3 million compared with a loss of $49 million in the year-ago quarter and loss of $293 million in the previous quarter.Mentor Graphics PartnershipAdvanced Micro's recent strategic partnership with Mentor Graphics on embedded technology will offer more choice to embedded developers in the x86 architecture high-performance computing segment. As more and more devices become interconnected, Advanced Micro's efforts to further strengthen its position in the burgeoning embedded markets will reap benefits. (Read:AMD and Mentor Graphics Ink Deal on Embedded Technology).Google DealIn November, the company announced that its FirePro server GPUs have been selected by AlphabetGOOGLto power its cloud platform in 2017. These developments are expected to help the company gain more traction in the GPU space and close in the market share gap with NVIDIA. (Read:AdvancedMicro Scales New Highs, Clinches Deal with Google).Balance SheetAdvanced Micro exited the fourth quarter with cash and cash equivalent balance of $1.26 billion, up $6 million from the previous quarter.During the quarter, the company raised approximately $1.4 billion in cash, before issuance costs, as a result of issuing $690 million of common stock and $700 million of Convertible Notes due 2026.Inventory was $751 million, up 10.8% on a year-over-year basis but down 2.7% sequentially. Total debt (short term and long term) was $1.43 billion, down $0.2 billion sequentially.GuidanceManagement expects first-quarter 2017 revenues to decrease 11% sequentially (+/- 3%), primarily due to seasonal weakness in semi-custom and graphics products. If the company manages to achieve the mid-point of its guidance, it will translate to 18% growth in revenues on a year-over-year basis.Gross margin is likely to be 33% while non-GAAP operating expenses are estimated to be $360 million.On the other hand, interest expense, taxes and others will amount to $30 million. Inventories are expected to remain flat on a sequential basis.Our TakeThe decent fourth-quarter results reflected AMD's improving position in key markets with the introduction of several APUs and GPUs. Moreover, partnerships with the likes of Google for the supply of Radeon Pro GPUs and FirePro server GPUs are positive in our view.Notably the company trails NVIDIA as the second-largest manufacturer of graphics chips for high-end computing and is gradually gaining traction in the space.Additionally, upcoming products like Ryzen and Zen are expected to drive the top line going ahead.Zacks RankAdvanced Micro has Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank stocks here.Zacks' Top 10 Stocks for 2017In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2017?Who wouldn't?

Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Has a New Hero: Services!;2/1/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) reported its fiscal first-quarter earnings on Tuesday after the bell, and it kicked the year off the right way. Apple set an all-time quarterly revenue record - snapping its streak of declines - and broke its previous iPhone sales record. AAPL stock is up strongly Wednesday morning as a result.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');Source: AppleBut the star of yesterday's show wasn't the iPhone. It was the Services division, which includes the App Store, Apple Pay, iTunes, AppleCare and Apple Music. Services didn't just set another record - it also posted the strongest year-over-year growth of any AAPL division.Services Is on Fire, Led by the App StoreApple reported that the quarterly revenue for its Services division topped $7.17 billion for Q1, an increase of 18% compared to the previous year. If that sounds like a lot of money for what is largely made up of mobile payment transaction fees and digital content, it is. In comparison,Netflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX) experienced its largest-ever subscriber growth in the final quarter of 2016, leading it to post revenue of $2.48 billion.During the AAPL earnings conference call, CEO Tim Cook noted that he expects the Services division to bethe size of a Fortune 100 company by the end of the year. Other key information about the Services division from that earnings call includes:App Store revenue for December alone was a record-setting $3 billionThere are now 2.2 million apps in the App Store, and AAPL paid out over $20 billion to developers in 2016The number of Apple Pay users has tripled over the past year, with transaction volume up over 500% year-over-yearAppleCare and storage services (iCloud) both set all-time recordsApple's music business grew for the third straight quarterWhy Services Revenue is ImportantYou might not know it based on Apple's record-setting iPhone sales this quarter, but selling hardware is tough.The Top 10 Dow Dividend Stocks for FebruaryOnce a consumer has an iPhone in his or her hands, it becomes very difficult to convince them to spend a minimum $649 to ditch that smartphone for a new one. In one sense, a huge installed user base - which AAPL has, withmore than 1 billion iOS devices in active use- works against the company. When the iPhone first began to take off, AAPL was selling to people who'd never owned one before. Now, that pool of easy sales is dwindling. And Apple is left in the tougher position of convincing its installed user base to upgrade.Thus the hand-wringing about slowing iPhone sales.Apple's Services division largely benefits from that huge installed user base, though. True, AAPL only gets one shot at selling these customers AppleCare. But once they own an iPhone, iPad, iPod, Mac, Apple Watch or AppleTV, they begin to explore Apple's other services. They are increasingly adopting Apple Pay. They are in a prime position to buy movies on their Apple TV. They are perfect candidates to subscribe to Apple Music. There are plenty of hooks for storing data on iCloud. And of course, there is the App Store and the lure of its millions of apps.Apple's Services revenue doesn't come in big chunks like selling an iPhone. It's $9.99 a month here, 99 cents for an app there, a few cents for a transaction. But it adds up, especially when over a billion customers are generating it.More importantly, that revenue doesn't drop off the same way hardware revenue does when people stop buying new iPhones.Some services - like iCloud and Apple Music - are subscription-based. AAPL keeps automatically billing the customer's card every month regardless of whether their iPhone is brand new or five years old. Apple Pay revenues are increasing as more countries and businesses accept it and iPhone owners grow more accustomed to using it.Bottom Line for AAPLPeople never stop buying apps. They may slow down after the initial rush of a new device, but developers keep bring enticing new games and other apps to the App Store. That means the 1 billion users continue to download.Trade of the Day: Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock No Longer a Home RunJust look at the 40 million-plusSuper Mario Rundownloads from the App Storein only four days.How many iPhones will AAPL sell two years from now? No one knows for sure, but odds are it won't be many more than it does now. On the other hand, Apple is confident its highflying App Store, Apple Pay and other services will see Services division revenue double in that time.The iPhone may have driven Apple stock growth over the past decade. But Services revenue is increasingly important as AAPL stock searches for that elusive next hardware hit.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 Stocks to Buy That Already Make America GreatCan Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Jump Over These Hurdles?The Only 3 Vanguard Funds You Need to Build a PortfolioThe postApple Inc.

Can Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Jump Over These Hurdles?;2/1/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAhead of earnings forFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB), which will come out at the end of trading on Wednesday, investors are certainly upbeat. And why not? FB stock has been a pretty good bet.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockBut could things be different this time around? Maybe the enthusiasm for Facebook stock is too carried away?Well, it is important to note that the valuation is still reasonable. The forward price-to-earnings ratio on FB stock is at about 25X. This compares to roughly 20X for bothAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) andMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT). And these companies are not growing at anywhere near the pace of Facebook.What's more, it seems like Facebook earnings should do fine in Q4. Revenues are expected to jump by 46% to $8.5 billion and adjusted EPS are forecasted to come to $1.31, up from 79 cents during the same period a year ago. Keep in mind that - for the past five quarters - the company has beat the Street on both the top and bottom lines.FB Stock Still Faces Several RisksBut the real potential issue for Facebook stock is any disappointing commentary on the future growth trends. Interestingly enough, on the Q3 earnings call, the company's CFO had this ominous thing tosay: ""We continue to expect that revenue growth rates will decline in Q4 as we lap a strong fourth quarter in 2015. We also continue to expect that our total payments and other fees revenue in Q4 will be lower than it was in the fourth quarter of last year.""10 Stocks to Buy That Already Make America GreatNo doubt, this should not be a surprise. As FB gets much larger, it will increasingly get more difficult to churn out strong revenue numbers. It's the curse of the so-called ""law of large numbers.""Let's face it, Facebook already has a massive user base. In the most recent quarter, the number of monthly active users hit 1.79 billion, up 16% on a year-over-year basis. There were also a stunning 1.2 billion daily users.But going forward, what will the sources of new users be? It's hard to tell. But initiatives from FB show concerns. After all, the company has been working hard to provide internet access to developing nations.And don't forget about China. According to a report from theWall Street Journal, it appears that Facebook has made little progress. Instead, rivals likeWeibo Corp(ADR)(NASDAQ:WB) andTencent(OTCMKTS:TCEHY) have been capitalizing on the opportunity.At the same time, other problems could affect FB stock. For example, during the last few months, there have been various embarrassing stories about how the company has inflated certain metrics. Might this cause some pushback from advertisers?The Snapchat IPO: The Next Facebook Inc (FB) ... Or Twitter Inc (TWTR)?Then there is the ""fake news"" controversy. Granted, the company has taken actions to improve the publishing of news, such as with a focus on credible sources. But this could result in lower clicks and views, which would slow down the revenue momentum for Facebook stock.Something else that could dampen some of the enthusiasm for FB stock: the upcoming Snapchat IPO, which should hit the markets within the next couple of months. Of course, there will be tremendous buzz and excitement. There will also be the inevitable comparisons to FB. In other words, investors may look at Snapchat as an alternative to Facebook stock when seeking the next growth play.Overall, Wednesday's earnings announcement will definitely be important. And if there are signs of deceleration on the top-line, FB stock could be vulnerable, especially since it has already pulled off a nice run for the year.Tom Taulli runs the InvestorPlace blogIPO Playbookand is a registered investment adviser representative (you canvisit his siteto learn more about his financial planning services).He is also the author of various books on investing like All About Commodities, All About Short Selling and High-Profit IPO Strategies.Follow him on Twitter at@ttaulli.

Is Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Resurrecting the Cursed Windows RT?;1/31/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsDon't look now, butMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) looks to be taking another run atAlphabet Inc's(NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) Chrome operating system. References have begun popping up in builds of the Windows 10 Creators Update (which is due to arrive in April) to Windows 10 Cloud.makeArticleAd();Source: MicrosoftSpeculation is growing that Windows 10 Cloud is in fact a new simplified version of Microsoft's operating system, designed to run on devices powered by inexpensive ARM chips fromARM Holdings plc (ADR)(NASDAQ:ARMH).In other words, it appears that Microsoft is preparing to take on the threat of Chromebooks - the cheap, popular laptops running Google's Chrome OS. And it seems to be doing so by resurrecting the idea of Windows RT.Windows 10 CloudWindows 10 Creators Build is the next major revision of the Microsoft Windows PC operating system. It's due to begin rolling out to users around April 17.The 5 Best Stocks to Buy for Big Emerging Markets ProfitsBut developers have been testing pre-release builds of Microsoft's software and recently some of them began to notice something strange: The code references different variations of the operating system. For example, Windows 10 Pro for Workstation and Windows 10 for Enterprise are spiked out. Nothing unusual there. But then, references to Windows 10 Cloud began to appear. And that started raising eyebrows - what is Windows 10 Cloud?ZDNet'sMary Jo Foley put the pieces together yesterday. Quoting unnamed sources, she says that the mysterious Windows 10 Cloud is a new, simplified version of Microsoft Windows that will run only Unified Windows Platform (UWP) apps. In other words, it's a""simpler, safer, cheaper"" version of Windows 10.You might also think of it as another crack at Windows RT …Windows RT? But Why?Everyone remembers the mess that wasWindows RT. The attempt to shoehorn a version of Windows onto a consumer tablet running ARM chips -the ill-fated Surface RT - very nearly dealt MSFT's tablet aspirations a fatal blow.However, despite the failure of Windows RT, Microsoft has never given up on the idea of Windows on ARM chips. By doing so, it can get Windows onto mobile devices that can't use the more powerful and expensive chips fromIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC). The company has already been showing offWindows 10 running in emulation on high-end ARM chips. As part of that effort, it could also be working on a ""lite"" version that can deliver much of the Windows 10 experience on less expensive, lower powered ARM hardware.So why, why,whywould Microsoft risk falling flat on its face again with what essentially amounts to another crack at Windows RT? There are two reasons.The first is that dream of ""Windows everywhere."" Having the full Windows 10 experience on high-powered ARM chips is great, but only flagship smartphones and tablets can afford to use those chips. Windows 10 Cloud would get Microsoft Windows (and Bing) onto a whole lot more mobile hardware.The second is Google's Chrome OS and Chromebooks. These cheap laptops have been under Microsoft's skin for years. They've become extremely popular in the education sector thanks to low cost, ease of use and built-in security. And Chromebooks have just kept selling, to the point where last year they passed evenApple Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AAPL)MacBooks in sales.Microsoft has tried fighting back by helping manufacturers put out cheap Windows 10 laptops, but that hasn't stemmed the Chromebook flood. Windows 10 makes for a sluggish experience on inexpensive Intel hardware, it's far more complex than Chrome OS to use and lacks the drop-dead easy security of Chromebooks.Cash Out of Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Before EarningsWindows 10 Cloud running on laptops with ARM processors would compete head-to-head with Chromebooks running Chrome OS: simpler, safer and cheaper than Windows 10.Microsoft refused to comment on theZDNetpost, but the pieces pointing to Windows 10 as a Chrome OS-fighting, second crack at Windows RT make sense. Naturally, MSFT is going to avoid all references to Windows RT - that's poison - and the Windows 10 Cloud name could end up being a code name.It could also be an attempt to steal some of the Chrome OS ""cloud"" thunder. Expect to get the final answer on Windows 10 Cloud from Microsoft prior to that April 17 Windows 10 Creators Build release.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace3 ""Golden"" Ammo Stocks to Buy for Big 2017 Returns3 Stocks to Buy for Better Deals Than the Great RecessionThe postIs Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Resurrecting the Cursed Windows RT?appeared first onInvestorPlace."

4 Reasons I'm Buying Baidu Inc. (ADR) Stock;1/31/2017;"Chinese search giantBaidu(NASDAQ: BIDU) is often dismissed as a slow-growth tech stock   that has run out of room to grow. Its heavy investments in   expanding its ecosystem into adjacent markets have weighed down   its bottom line growth, making the stock seem like dead money.   Despite those challenges, however, I recently started a new   position in Baidu for four main reasons.Baidu Image Search. Image source: Author's screenshot.makeArticleAd();1. It's still the 800-pound gorillaBaidu controls roughly 80% of the internet search market in   China. That dominant position enables it to expand its ecosystem   in the same way asAlphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google. Its sprawling ecosystem   now includes Baidu Maps, video streaming site iQiyi, its Duer   voice assistant, the Baidu Wallet payment platform, numerous   portal sites, and various O2O (online-to-offline) services in its   ""monolithic"" mobile app.While the profitability of these services varies greatly, they   all help Baidu gather data from its users for targeted ads. Last   quarter, Baidu's revenue per online marketing customer rose 10.6%   annually. This indicates that Baidu still remains a top   advertising pick in China, even as other popular apps -- likeTencent's WeChat -- tether more users to their ecosystems. Moreover,   China still has an internet penetration rate of just 52%, which   means that there may be plenty of room for all these companies to   expand without stepping on each other's toes.2. Its slowdown is temporaryBaidu fell out of favor with growth investors as its top and   bottom line growth seemingly dried up. Last quarter, its revenue   fell  0.7% annually, its core online marketing revenue slid   6.7%, and its non-GAAP net income rose just 6.3%. Analysts expect   its  revenue to rise 6% this year, but for its earnings to   decline 9%.However, that slowdown was mainly caused by three temporary   headwinds. First, Chinese regulators forced Baidu to remove   misleading pharmaceutical ads following the death of a student   who bought unapproved cancer drugs advertised on the site.   Second, Baidu sold its stake in online travel agencyQunarto its rivalCtrip(NASDAQ: CTRP) , essentially swapping its stake in Qunar for one   in Ctrip but temporarily throttling revenue growth.Lastly, Baidu's heavy investments in R&D are squeezing its   margins, but launching new services could boost its long-term   growth and widen its moat against rivals like Tencent. That's why   analysts believe that Baidu's revenue and earnings will   respectively rebound 21% and 33% in fiscal 2017.3. Growth potential in next-gen marketsLike Google, Baidu is investing heavily in artificial   intelligence, driverless cars, and other ""next-gen"" technologies.   Machine learning and AI have become increasingly important to   search and advertising companies, since they help gather more   data from users to create targeted ads that users are more likely   to click on. Baidu has been hiring a lot of top talent in that   field -- its chief scientist, Andrew Ng, previously led the   Google Brain AI project, and its  new augmented reality   chief Qi Lu was aMicrosoftexec specializing in AI.To showcase its AI efforts, Baidu pitted its AI robot against   Google's AlphaGo AI in a battle of facial and voice recognition   in early January. It partnered withNVIDIAand HERE Maps to develop mapping systems for autonomous vehicles,   and plans to launch a driverless shuttle bus in China in 2018. It   also partnered with  smart remote maker Peel to establish a   foothold in the growing smart home market. These projects   won't generate meaningful revenue for years, but they could   greatly expand Baidu's O2O ecosystem over the long term.4. The stock is still cheapBaidu currently trades at just 13 times earnings, which is   much lower than Google's P/E of 31 and the industry average of 50   for internet information providers. But due to its projected   decline in earnings this year, the stock has a forward P/E of 30.   While that forward multiple doesn't seem cheap, we should   remember that Baidu's earnings are expected to rebound in   2017.The key takeawayBaidu will likely remain weighed down by near-term challenges   over the next few quarters, but it's still well-positioned to   profit from the long-term growth of the Chinese internet market.   Baidu may struggle to pull social users away from Tencent and   shoppers away fromAlibaba, but its dominance of the search-based ad market won't end   anytime soon.10 stocks we like better than Alphabet (A     shares)When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Alphabet Employees Protest Against Trump's Immigration Ban;1/31/2017;"Protests against Donald Trump's anti-immigration policy are gaining steam and the technology sector appears to be leading the way.  More than 2000Alphabet Inc.'sGOOGLGoogle employees staged protests against Trump's immigration ban by walking out of eight offices worldwide including the company's headquarters in Mountain View on Monday. Photos and videos of the walkouts have been tweeted using hashtag #GooglersUnite.Google co-founder Sergey Brin and CEO Sundar Pichai have extended their full support to the opposition.Concurrent with the protest, Google created a $4 million fund to support immigrant rights groups like the Immigrant Legal Resource Center, the American Civil Liberties Union, the U.N. Refugee Agency and the International Rescue Committee.The protest was particularly against Trump's executive order to ban nationals of seven Muslim majority countries - Iraq, Iran, Somalia, Libya, Syria, Sudan and Yemen - from coming to the U.S. Pichai denounced the order and stated that the ban affects about 187 Google employees.We note that not quite long ago, Trump had called up technology leaders and urged them to create and retain jobs within the U.S. to which most of them had given their nods. However as the immigration ban order rolled out, the sector is sending clear indications that it will not create jobs at the cost of preventing entry to external talent.Alphabet Inc. Free Cash Flow (TTM)Alphabet Inc. Free Cash Flow (TTM)|Alphabet Inc. QuoteProtests Across the Technology IndustryTrump's immigration restrictions have faced the flak of tech leaders in the form of tweets, memos and statements. Chief executive officers of MicrosoftMSFT, AppleAAPL, NetflixNFLX, Uber, Airbnb and Tesla Motors have all indicated that they are against the decision.The technology sector recruits a big chunk outside talent and the survival of the sector could be at stake if immigration reduces or stops completely.The sector fears that Trump may overhaul the H1-B program that allows Silicon Valley to bring foreign engineers and technical experts to the U.S. for three to six years.Zacks Rank and Stock Price MovementAt present, Alphabet is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company.

The proportion of companies beating EPS and revenue estimates, however, is tracking moderately below other recent periods.Looking at Q4 as a whole, combining the actual results from the 171 index members with estimates from the still-to-come 329 companies, total earnings are expected to be up +5.3% from the same period last year on +4% higher revenues. This is the best earnings and revenue growth pace in the last 8 quarters. Importantly, estimates for the current period (2017 Q1) are holding up fairly well; they are coming down, but not at the pace as would typically expected. All of this should help add to confidence in market expectations for the current and following quarters when growth is expected to notably ramp up.Buy ratedMicrosoftshares lagged the Zacks Tech sector through the fall, but have led the way over the last three months (up +9.8% versus +6%) on greater appreciation for the company's reorganization and repositioning which got reconfirmed by the company's impressive quarterly results last week. The Zacks analyst points to the company's continuing enterprise strength, benefits from the Office 365 subscription model, strong growth prospects of Azure and promising new products. The recent acquisition of artificial intelligence startup Maluuba is a big positive for the company given the growing demand for artificial intelligence techniques throughout the world. Further, the anticipated completion of the LinkedIn acquisition will boost Microsoft's presence in the social media market.

The company's fourth-quarter 2016 results were mixed, with revenues beating expectations and earnings coming in-line. But the Zacks analyst likes the business mix and diversification which allows the company to deliver consistent earnings and dividend growth. The company is focused on revamping its aerospace unit to overhaul the organizational structure and accelerate inorganic growth through potential acquisition opportunities.

Apple Inc. Gets Extra Help From the Dual Camera iPhone 7 Plus (AAPL);1/30/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhenApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) first introduced its new, big and bigger smartphones - the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus - the company opted to offer a few minor features for buyers of the largest model. The 6 Plus had longer battery life, and an image stabilized camera. That basic strategy continued with the 6s Plus in 2015. But last year with the iPhone 7 Plus, AAPL included a more significant carrot in the signature Dual Camera feature.makeArticleAd();Source: AppleThe move of making a key feature exclusive to its larger phones appears to have paid off with a big increase in iPhone 7 Plus sales compared to regular iPhone 7 sales.Having more of the costlier iPhone 7 Plus models in the mix means AAPL can generate more revenue, even if overall unit sales are soft.Differentiating Between Big and BiggerHistorically, the larger-sized iPhone hasn't sold nearly as well as the ""standard"" 4.7-inch model.When AAPL first introduced the two model strategy in 2014, the iPhone 6 Plus had an immediate bump in demand from Apple fans who were hungry for a phablet. It was also very popular in Asian markets, where phablets, which can take the place of both smartphone and tablet, are often preferred. However, overall the bigger and more expensive iPhone 6 Plus only accounted foraround 20% of overall iPhone salesglobally.10 Stocks to Buy That Already Make America GreatIn 2015, AAPL added a little more appeal to the bigger iPhone, adding increased RAM to the optically image stabilized camera for the iPhone 6 Plus. However, that saw just a small uptick in sales of the bigger model.Last year, Apple rolled the dice: It decided to release a dual camera smartphone, a premium upgrade that it heavily promoted as a must-have feature. With this advanced camera system, users could take DSLR-like portraits and optically zoom in on subjects. AAPL made this key feature an iPhone 7 Plus exclusive, at the same time boosting the price of its larger iPhone. Previously, it had charged $649 and $749 respectively for the two sizes. In 2016, the company still started the iPhone 7 at $649, but to get the dual camera smartphone feature required shelling out at least $769 for the iPhone 7 Plus.iPhone 7 Sales See Big Increase in iPhone 7 Plus AdoptionTheWall Street Journalis reporting that Apple's iPhone 7 Plus strategy appears to have paid off. Citing numbers from Cowen & Co. UBS, Cowen and Creative Strategies Inc., theWSJsays that in AAPL's first quarter (ending in December), theiPhone 7 Plus is estimated to have accounted for 40% of total iPhone 7 sales, globally.Breaking the numbers down regionally, it's estimated that 52% of Chinese iPhone buyers opted for the more expensive iPhone 7 Plus, while in the U.S. it accounted for 47% of total iPhone 7 sales.Why Increased iPhone 7 Plus to iPhone 7 Sales MatterThe difference between the two iPhone models is material to AAPL's bottom line.Apple Inc. New iPads Might Be Late to the Party (AAPL)It's likely that the iPhone 7 Plus costs Apple more to manufacture than previous Plus versions - it does have more RAM, a larger battery and that dual camera system - but at least some of the additional cost is offset by the boost from $749 to $769.The profit margin for Apple on the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus probably remains roughly the same. However, with a base price that's $120 higher, having more Plus models in the mix means that even if overall iPhone 7 sales are soft, the average selling price of a new iPhone goes up. As a result, iPhone revenue could get a boost, despite sales that may not meet expectations.And, as theWSJarticle points out, there's another positive point for AAPL in the iPhone 7 Plus numbers. The fact that pricing the iPhone 7 Plus so high still resulted in big gains for the premium smartphone bodes well for later this year when the company will release the10th anniversary iPhone 8. The iPhone 7 sales numbers indicate that AAPL has additional room to price the iPhone 8 as an ultra-premium, special edition model if it chooses.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace3 Things Apple Inc.

But for the short term, investors have to contend with the knee-jerk reactions.Having said that, there are ways I can trade earnings reports without much out-of-pocket risk. Last week I sold puts in MSFT to buy its calls. The trade was an easy win.10 Stocks to Buy That Already Make America GreatThis week, I will set up a trade to benefit from a positive reaction to FB's earnings. Experts think that Wall Street will not be impressed by what FB stock management has to report and that the risk is to the downside. I want to bet on the opposite but without much immediate risk.FB Stock TradesClick to EnlargeThe Trade:Buy Facebook Mar $135 calls. This is a bullish trade for which I pay $3 per contract to open. To profit, I need FB stock to rally past my strike before mid March. I could change this trade to a debit call spread to lower the entry cost. So I would instead buy the $135/$140 debit call spread and only spend $1.40 per contract. The trade-off is that with the spread, I cap my maximum profit to $3.60 per contract.I usually like to lower my entry cost especially when volatility is high so I need to cautiously sell options.The Bank:Sell the Facebook Dec $100 put. This is a bullish trade for which I collect $3.80 per contract. This trade has an 85% theoretical chance of success and a 18% price buffer from current price.I only sell naked puts if I am willing and able to own the stock at the strike sold. IF FB stock falls below $100 per share this year I would be put the stock. Anything lower than $96 per share would be losses for me.The Twist:Selling naked puts is not suited for every risk profile. So I can change the bank trade to being a credit put spread instead. Selling a spread makes the trade's maximum risk finite. For example, I can sell the FB Dec $100/$95 credit put spread. I collect $1.06 per contract to open. If successful, this trade yields 22% on money risked.Why Under Armour Inc (UA) Stock Could Be ScrewedThis is one of those occasions where I could do either or both. Some traders don't like selling risk into an earning report. I don't mind doing it with quality stocks like FB. I also usually do it far out in time and away from current levels.I am not required to hold option trades through expiration. I can close them at any time for partial gains or losses.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director ofSellSpreads.com.

One Put, One Call Option To Know About for Microsoft;1/30/2017;"Consistently, one of the more popular stocks people enter into theirstock options watchlistat Stock Options Channel is Microsoft Corporation (Symbol: MSFT). So this week we highlight one interesting put contract, and one interesting call contract, from the July expiration for MSFT. The put contract our YieldBoost algorithm identified as particularly interesting, is at the $57.50 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $1.23. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 2.1% return against the $57.50 commitment, or a 4.5% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this theYieldBoost).Selling a put does not give an investor access to MSFT's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. So unless Microsoft Corporation sees its shares fall 11.7% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $56.27 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $1.23 from $57.50), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 4.5% annualized rate of return.makeArticleAd();Interestingly, that annualized 4.5% figure actually exceeds the 2.4% annualized dividend paid by Microsoft Corporation by 2.1%, based on the current share price of $65.13. And yet, if an investor was to buy the stock at the going market price in order to collect the dividend, there is greater downside because the stock would have to lose 11.69% to reach the $57.50 strike price.Always important when discussing dividends is the fact that, in general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of Microsoft Corporation, looking at the dividend history chart for MSFT below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 2.4% annualized dividend yield.Turning to the other side of the option chain, we highlight one call contract of particular interest for the July expiration, for shareholders of Microsoft Corporation (Symbol: MSFT) looking to boost their income beyond the stock's 2.4% annualized dividend yield. Selling the covered call at the $70 strike and collecting the premium based on the $1.33 bid, annualizes to an additional 4.3% rate of return against the current stock price (this is what we at Stock Options Channel refer to as theYieldBoost), for a total of 6.7% annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away. Any upside above $70 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away, but MSFT shares would have to climb 7.5% from current levels for that to occur, meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called, the shareholder has earned a 9.6% return from this trading level, in addition to any dividends collected before the stock was called.The chart below shows the trailing twelve month trading history for Microsoft Corporation, highlighting in green where the $57.50 strike is located relative to that history, and highlighting the $70 strike in red:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the July put or call options highlighted in this article deliver a rate of return that represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Microsoft Corporation (considering the last 251 trading dayMSFT historical stock pricesusing closing values, as well as today's price of $65.13) to be 20%.In mid-afternoon trading on Monday, the put volume among S&P 500 components was 1.08M contracts, with call volume at 1.29M, for a put:call ratio of 0.83 so far for the day, which is unusually high compared to the long-term median put:call ratio of .65. In other words, there are lots more put buyers out there inoptions tradingso far today than would normally be seen, as compared to call buyers.Find out which 15 call and put options traders are talking about today.Top YieldBoost MSFT Calls »"

The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights: Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and Intel;1/30/2017;"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL - January 30, 2017 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog includeMicrosoft(NASDAQ:MSFT-Free Report),Apple(NASDAQ:AAPL-Free Report),Amazon(NASDAQ:AMZN-Free Report),Alphabet(NASDAQ:GOOGL-Free Report) andIntel(NASDAQ:INTC-Free Report).Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations.Get #1Stock of the Day pick for free.Here are highlights from Friday's Analyst Blog:The Cloud Drives Technology Stocks This QuarterAnalysts and experts have talked at length about the importance of cloud computing and how it would transform the technology sector. But the sense of waiting that underpinned such discussions is now giving way to a sense of arrival.Several factors are making cloud computing a reality today, the most important of which are an awareness of the resultant cost reductions, awareness of the economic value of processing ever-increasing volumes of data, and recognition of the advantages of sharing resources and having anytime anywhere access to data and information.Of course, along with all these advantages comes concerns related to privacy and security, which have been further exacerbated by government snooping, gag orders and orders to turn over data in private individual devices or in servers on foreign soil that have in turn made individuals and corporations wary about adopting the cloud.But technology companies are fighting it out. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT-Free Report) for one has strongly resisted government demands as have Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL-Free Report) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN-Free Report). Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOGL-Free Report) Google has also been vocal in its opposition. It makes perfect sense when you consider that these are some of the biggest cloud computing stocks that also offer computing and other devices. So they have vested interests at both ends of the networks.Other players with similar interests are chip makers like Intel (NASDAQ:INTC-Free Report); networking companies like Cisco and Juniper; and software/service companies like IBM and Oracle.Here's a brief glimpse of three cloud companies that just reported December quarter results:IntelIntel's results this quarter were driven by both the PC and data center businesses. The PC strength was seasonal and unlikely to be sustained.Although non-volatile memory had the strongest growth rate of 24.8% and will grow even stronger this year, it currently contributes a lower share of revenue, which equates to fewer incremental dollars. Also, the business is poised to benefit from Intel's strength in the server market.Data center revenue growth of 8% year over year was helped by platform volume growth of 3% and platform price increase of 4%. Intel has new products in the pipeline and will also be integrating some technology it acquired through Altera, so this year may be less disappointing than the last when enterprise softness skewed expectations.MicrosoftMicrosoft has become a cloud-focused company, impressing analysts and investors alike. The company is making the most of legacy workloads that use its software and its all-new Windows OS, while leveraging Office productivity software and enterprise relationships to post record growth in cloud revenue.The company reported solid cloud results, with Azure revenue growing 93% (95% in constant currency) and compute usage doubling year over year. Its cloud productivity business also saw strong growth: Office 365 commercial revenue grew 47% (49% in constant currency) with seat growth of 37% and monthly active iOS and Android devices more than doubling to 65 million, Office 365 consumer revenue grew 22% (21% in constant currency) with seat growth of 20.9%.Dynamics 365 paid seats also more than doubled. Nadella promised commercial cloud annualized revenue runrate of $20.0 billion in 2018 and last quarter's $14.0 billion means that Microsoft is definitely on track to beat or exceed the target.AlphabetAlphabet doesn't break out its cloud revenue separately although independent market research data indicates that it is well behind market leader Amazon and even runners up Microsoft. In fact after the December quarter results some analysts have started saying that Microsoft has also started pulling away from the pack in its chase of Amazon.Alphabet's growth should not be discounted however because while cloud and hardware are lumped together right now, its common knowledge that most of its new hardware has been unavailable for a lot of the time. So the 62% growth in this segment seems to be less on account of hardware sales and more of an indication of strength it is seeing in the cloud.CFO Ruth Porat has said that cloud, hardware and YouTube subscriptions will be ""major revenue drivers for Google in the next several years."" This will of course require capital investment, something the company can afford given the way the search business continues to rake in cash. Capex was around $3.08 billion last quarter, that's nearly up by a billion dollars and will mostly be spent on data centers to support its cloud business.Now See Our Private Investment IdeasWhile the above ideas are being shared with the public, other trades are hidden from everyone but selected members.

Monday’s Vital Data: Facebook Inc (FB), Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN);1/30/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsU.S. stock futures are pulling back this morning, as President Donald Trump's travel ban on immigrants from several predominantly Muslim countries cast doubts on further economic policies. The uncertainty has placed theDow Jones Industrial Average'stentative hold on 20,000 in question amid a flood of key corporate earnings this week.makeArticleAd();Heading into the open, futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average are off 0.3%, whileS&P 500futures have dropped 0.34% andNasdaq-100futures have fallen 0.35%.On the options front, volume arrived below average on Friday, as about 14.4 million calls and 13.6 million puts crossed the tape. Over on the CBOE, puts gained traction ahead of the weekend, as the single-session equity put/call volume ratio jumped to a one-month high of 0.73, forcing the 10-day moving average to tick higher to 0.66.Turning to Friday's volume leaders, earnings was the major driver for several large tech names on the top ten most active options listing.Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) reports after the close tomorrow afternoon, whileFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) will step into the limelight after the close on Wednesday. Finally, online retailing giantAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) joins the fray after the close on Thursday.Facebook Inc (FB)FB stock saw a wellspring of call option activity on Friday at a time when many traders were seeking protection ahead of the weekend. Total volume on the stock rose to 755,000 contracts, with calls snapping up an impressive 71% of the day's take.7 Stocks to Buy That Could Double by 2018Call buying was the order of the day, as traders appear to be anticipating a post-earnings rally from Facebook this Wednesday.Following Friday's close, the 3 Feb put/call open interest ratio slipped from 0.82 at the beginning of the session to 0.75 as calls were added at a faster rate than puts among options most affected by Facebook's quarterly report - implying rising expectations for a bullish post-earnings move. Implieds are still pricing in a move of about 5.3% for FB stock, with the upper bound lying at roughly $139.50 and the lower bound resting at $125.50.For the record, Facebook earnings are expected to rise nearly 66% to $1.31 per share, with sales soaring 45.4% to $8.49 billion. According toEarningsWhispers.com, the whisper number for Facebook's fourth-quarter comes in at $1.37 per share.Apple Inc (AAPL)iPhone maker Apple is also on tap to release its quarterly report this week. Analysts are expecting a year-over-year decline of about 2% for Apple earnings, down to $3.22 per share from $3.28 per share a year ago. Revenue is expected to creep 2% higher to $77.38 billion.Even speculative analysts remain reserved on Apple, asEarningsWhispers.comreports a whisper number of only $3.23 per share. That said, iPhone unit sales and guidance amid the current geopolitical climate could be the major drivers for any post-earnings reaction for AAPL stock.As such, options traders appear to be playing it close to the vest on AAPL. Friday's activity revealed a bit of trepidation, with calls accounting for a below-average 58% of the 637,000 contracts traded on Apple stock. The 3 Feb. options series also shows a bit of concern for AAPL's earnings reaction, with the put/call OI ratio coming in at 0.74, slightly above Apple's historic pre-earnings range nearer 0.70. Furthermore, peak 3 Feb. call OI rests at the in-the-money $120 strike, hinting at low expectations for AAPL stock.Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN)Last, but certainly not least, Amazon.com will release its fourth-quarter earnings report after the close on Thursday, and it looks like evenI underestimated AMZN stock's potential. Several retailers have already reported this quarter, blaming lower-than-expected sales figures on slowing foot traffic, mainly due to the rising dominance of online shopping - a market in which Amazon commands38% of the market share.How to Trade Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock After EarningsStill, AMNZ options traders appeared reluctant to jump on the bullish bandwagon on Friday. Total volume rose to 247,000 contracts, with calls only eking out 58% of the day's take.That said, peak call OI for the 3 Feb series totals 1,300 contracts at the deep out-of-the-money $900 strike, with another 1,200 contracts at the $870 strike. So, while volume remains a touch conservative, AMZN options traders still appear to have high expectations for a post-earnings rally.As of this writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 Stocks to Buy That Already Make America Great10 High-Yield Dividend Stocks That Are SOMEHOW Still BargainsThe postMonday's Vital Data: Facebook Inc (FB), Apple Inc.

Facebook Inc (FB) Stock: New All-Time Highs or New Problems?;1/30/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB) enters this week's fourth-quarter earnings report in a peculiar position: Despite the fact that FB stock is trading near all-time highs, Facebook absolutely has something to prove.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockThat's because FB has spent the past three months recovering from a rough Q3 report that sent the stock to one of its biggest dips since coming public in 2012. While the company reported a strong earnings beat, Facebook CFO warned about a slowdown in revenue growth for Q4, and said ad load might ""come down meaningfully"" in the second half of this year.The news sparked a selloff from which Facebook wouldn't really recover until the start of 2017. But recover it has - FB stock is up roughly 15% in the past month to trade near all-time highs around $113.So, what's in store for Facebook this time around?If you believe Jefferies analyst Brian Fitzgerald, FB could be sitting on the powder keg that sends Facebook through the price ceiling.Fitzgerald believes Instagram and mobile ad revenues will drive the business forward, and expects Q4 revenues to grow 46% year-over-year to $8.54 billion - slightly ahead of Wall Street's broader estimates for $8.5 billion. He also projects GAAP profits of $1.05, which are a penny higher than the consensus mark.""We remain particularly optimistic around Instagram, bottom-funnel ad units like DPAs, and Live video,"" says Fitzgerald, whose $175 price target represents 33% upside from here. ""While expense growth is a potential concern, FB has a history of under-promising and overdelivering in this area.""10 Stocks to Buy That Already Make America GreatIndeed, mobile is king for Facebook, which crossed the 1 billion mark for ""mobile only"" active users in Q3. In fact, 84% of the company's $6.82 billion in ad revenues came from mobile - up from 78% in the year-ago period. At about $5.7 billion, mobile ad sales came in more than 30% higher thantotalFacebook ad sales in Q3 2015.Still, if Facebook matches Wall Street's projections for 45.6% sales growth, that would be down both sequentially from Q3's 59% revenue expansion, and last Q4's 52% increase in sales. Which means investors will be looking for other areas of growth.They could get it in Facebook Live, the company's somewhat controversial live streaming service that has unwittingly exposed users to real-time torture and suicide videos. Still, CEO believes images and video are the future of Facebook - and the expansion and advertising of Live's services reflect that plenty.Facebook will need to show Wall Street something exciting, though, or FB could be in for its second straight quarterly tumble.Facebook shares reached all-time highs just above $133 in late October. They then dropped but rebounded to the $132 area, but were rejected following the Q3 earnings report. FB then was sent packing to the $114 level, which it fought several times before rebounding into the current rally.Now, Facebook stock finds itself challenging the $132-$133 area once more, but this time with an overbought Relative Strength Index (RSI) reading in the low 70s.And from a fundamental perspective, Facebook's forward price-to-earnings ratio of 25 isn't nearly on par with the likes of pricey Big Tech stocks such asNetflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX), but it's still a little lofty.At the very least, it'll be on investors' minds - especially if Facebook lays an egg Wednesday.More Earnings in FocusApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Jan. 31:When Apple reports fiscal Q1 earnings this Tuesday, Wall Street expects the iPhone maker to finally snap its short streak of consecutive revenue declines with a small 2% uptick in sales. Earnings, however, are expected to shrink slightly, by about 2% to $3.22 per share. Naturally, the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus will be in focus - Q1 covers the holiday season, which typically accounts for the year's biggest chunk of the iPhone revenue pie.However, Macquarie Capital's Ben Schachter thinks Services - which includes the App Store and AppleCare -might be the star of this show:""The oft underestimated and misunderstood Services segment has the potential to drive ~100 bps [=1%] of overall gross margin expansion per year for Apple. However, if one believes that iPhone units can grow with iPhone 8 and then be roughly stable going forward, we believe Services and Apps will become the growth engine for Apple.""Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Feb. 2:Amazon, on the other hand, is expected to keep up its torrid growth numbers when it reports Q4 earnings on Thursday. Profits are expected to improve by 35% to $1.35 per share, while revenues should surge 25% to $44.67 billion. Numerous brick-and-mortar retailers reported difficult holiday seasons, hinting at more gains for the ubiquitous e-tailer.How to Trade Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock After EarningsAlso promising is a note from Cowen analyst John Blackledge, who says Prime has ""maintained healthy growth."" He pointed toward a Cowen survey suggesting that Amazon Prime's customer base has grown 22% year-over-year to 50 million. Keep an eye on Amazon Web Services, however, as AMZN's cloud-based profit generator is having to contend with an increasingly aggressive Microsoft Corp.

Symantec (SYMC) to Report Q3 Earnings: What Lies in Store?;1/30/2017;"makeZacksArticleAd();Symantec Corp.SYMCis set to report third-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Feb 1. Last quarter, the company's earnings were in-line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Notably, the stock has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate twice while matching the same once and missing on it once in the trailing four quarters. It has an average positive earnings surprise of 5.36%.Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderSymantec's earnings and revenues have been under pressure due to persistent weakness in PC sales, which particularly hurt its core Norton anti-virus software business. Apart from this, intensifying competition from Palo Alto Networks, FireEye Inc. and Check Point Software has also been eroding its market share in the enterprise segment.As a result, the company has been singularly focused on restructuring its business. In early 2016, Symantec closed the sale of the Veritas business to Carlyle Group for $7.4 billion. Symantec also completed the acquisition of Blue Coat, which has enabled it to reduce dependence on the PC market and strengthen its position in the enterprise security space. Revenues from the enterprise security segment are now expected to contribute 62% to the company's top line.These restructuring initiatives will positively impact results in the third quarter too, continuing the trend of the first half of fiscal 2017.Nonetheless, continued investments to launch new and innovative products could impact margins in the soon-to-be reported quarter. Also, competition from major players like MicrosoftMSFTand smaller companies like Kaspersky, which are consistently launching comparable and competitive products, poses a concern.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Symantec will beat earnings this quarter.

Overall the market was flat at the end of the week with the five highest-weighted sectors changing no more than 0.1% since Wednesday. Those sectors are technology, financials, health-care, consumer discretionary and industrials. Consumer staples and energy fluctuated more than others because of factors specific to their industries.The technology sector led all others because of an unexpected quarterly earnings gain byMicrosoft Corporation(NYSE:MSFT) due to gains in its cloud-computing business. The stock jumped 2.4%, up $1.51 to $65.78.The energy sector was weak on Friday due to a drop in the price of WTI crude oil to $53.18 per barrel, off 1.1%, and an earning miss byChevron Corporation(NYSE:CVX).According to FactSet, almost 34% of the S&P 500's stocks had reported earnings, at a blended growth rate of 4% compared to expectations of 5.2%7 Stocks to Buy That Could Double by 2018At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 7 points at 20,094, the S&P 500 lost 2 at 2,295, the Nasdaq gained 6 points, closing at 5,661, and the Russell 2000 closed at 1,371 for a loss of 5 points.

Intel Disappoints With Lukewarm Growth;1/29/2017;"Intel(INTC) topped analyst estimates during the fourth quarter, reporting earnings of 79 cents per share and revenues of $16.37 billion, while the market was expecting earnings of 74 cents per share and revenues of $15.752 billion.Intel was able to post better-than-expected results due to strong performance from two key segments, Client Computing and Internet of Things, according toCNBC. Internet of Things Group grew by 16% while the Data Center Group, which has a long-term double-digit growth target, only grew by 8%. Client Computing Group, the lead earner in Intel's portfolio which is dependent on PC sales around the world, posted a better than expected 4% year over year growth to reach $9.1 billion in revenue during the fourth quarter.Despite the noteworthy performance in 2016, Intel is still in the transition phase, as its revenue mix has yet to cut off reliance on the Client Computing Group.makeArticleAd();""We expectIntel'sclient computing segment revenues to decline by approximately $1.2 billion over the next five years. The revenue from this segment primarily includes the sales of Intel's processors in PCs, notebooks, tablets and mobile phones.""-Trefis, September 2016The segment's revenue grew by 2.13% in 2016 year over year to reach $32.908 billion, from $32.219 billion in 2015. Data Center Group revenue for 2016 was $17.236 billion, a growth of 7.8% year over year. Internet of Things group revenue grew by 14.7% to reach $2.638 billion.Intel needs the Data Center Group and Internet of Things group to grow to a level from where they both can offset any decline in the core segment, if necessary. In 2016, DCG and IOTG posted combined revenues of $19.874 billion, a full $12 billion less than CCG. Together, these two segments posting high single-digit growth can offer some protection against headwinds faced by CCG, but it's still not a great position to be in from a long-term perspective.Intel needs to crank up the pace on DCG, which also happens to the most profitable unit for the company. If this segment starts posting double-digit growth numbers, then Intel would be in a much better position. As such, 2017 will give us a clear indication of how long it will take for us to see the new Intel.The market knows that despite a solid 7% revenue growth performance from Intel in 2016, the company's transition is not in clear sight. That's the reason why it is still trading at nearly 16 times earnings and 3 times sales, whileMicrosoft(MSFT) has a much better valuation despite seeing its revenue decline last year, posting flat growth during the first quarter and strong growth only during the second quarter. In Microsoft's case, it's because the transition seems to be near its end, and we are also able to see the path forward. Intel still needs to get there.Disclosure:I have no positions in the stocks mentioned above and no intention to initiate a position in the next 72 hours.Start a free seven-day trial of Premium Membership to GuruFocus.Premium MembersThis article first appeared onGuruFocus."

17 Years Later, Microsoft Corp. Is Worth $500 Billion Again!;1/29/2017;"Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) is putting some pep back in its step these days.   On Friday, Reuters pointed out that the software giant's market   cap has risen above $500 billion for the first time since March   2000.I'm all for celebrating neat milestones, including this   17-year benchmark. And it's no secret that Microsoft really isdoinga lotof thingsrightthese days. Large-cap stocks don't post market-crushing 55%   returns in two years for no reason.That being said, I would like to argue that the Microsoft you   see today is miles removed from the $500 billion beast you knew   17 years ago.makeArticleAd();Horace Chow, Microsoft's general manager of Hong Kong     operations, illustrating ""transformation"" on stage. Image     source: Microsoft.Inflated dollar valuesFirst, let me point out that $500 billion ain't what it used   to be. The inexorable march of inflation hollows out the value of   your dollar over time, and 17 years of that action can do a lot   of damage. To wit:The buying power of $500 billion in 2016 dollars works out     to just $363 billion of inflation-adjusted 2000 currency.Conversely, $500 billion then is the equivalent of roughly     $697 billion in today's dollars.From this perspective, Microsoft would need a market cap     boost of 37% from today's total in order to make up for the     inflation effect.Okay, nobody sets up milestones and goalposts at $697 billion.   We want nice, round numbers. But if you don't consider   inflation-based erosion over the long run, you're doing a   disservice to your investments.It's real.Another yardstickMarket cap is the easy way out. You simply multiply current   share prices by the number of shares outstanding. Handy for   discussion and popular at every cocktail party, market cap is one   of those metrics you can lean on for quick comparisons.But it's also an overly simplistic measurement in many ways.   Let's say you actually wanted to buy all of Microsoft. You (or   the cabal of multi-billionaires and cash-rich companies you're   working with) would then have to take over all of Microsoft's   debts, because lenders and bondholders won't just drop their   claims when the takeover happens. On the upside, you also get to   keep all of Microsoft's cash equivalents, which is kind of like   buying a nice wallet and finding a hundred-dollar bill   inside.Now we're looking at theenterprise valueinstead. The market cap is just a starting point, followed by   adding the company's debt balances and subtracting its cash   reserves. This (plus an appropriate buyout premium) would be the   true price tag in a takeover.As it turns out, Microsoft comes with more cash equivalents   than debt. Today, this metric stops at $459 billion -- a few   bucks short of the magic $500 billion waterline. Here's how   Redmond's enterprise value has developed over the last 17 years   compared to the simpler market cap:MSFT Market Capdata byYCharts.But wait, there's more!Honestly, there's always more to say about a business as   complex as Microsoft. I'm not here to write a book today, so   let's keep this short and sweet.Before I go, let me just point out that Microsoft has done a   lot of growing up since the dot-com boom and bust. Trailing sales   have nearly quadrupled, while free cash flows doubled:MSFT Revenue (TTM)data byYCharts.The company's dividend policy is just 13 years old, but now   provides a decent 2.4% yield. And Microsoft's balance sheet was   free of long-term debt 17 years ago, but that changed in 2009.   The current statement of financial accounts has very little in   common with the lean, low-capital version it wielded in 2000.   Cash and debt balances have skyrocketed in recent years, and   Microsoft has started amassing a generous chunk of plant,   property, and equipment assets (PP&E in the chart below).If I didn't know better, this almost looks like the   balance-sheet antics of an industrial manufacturing   conglomerate:MSFT Net PP&E (Quarterly)data byYCharts.Meet the new boss, not the same as the old bossAny way you slice it, the rejuvenated version ofMicrosoft sharesfew characteristics with the older owner of a $500 billion market   cap. The world has changed, the software industry never stops   changing, and Microsoft is forever busy adjusting to new   realities.So if your opinions and investment thesis regarding Microsoft   haven't changed in 17 years, I'm sorry to say that the company   didnotjust hop in a time machine to skip the last 17 years. You'll have   somereadingto do if you want to keep up.10 stocks we like better than MicrosoftWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Microsoft Goes From Window(s) Cleaning to Cloud-Gazing;1/29/2017;"After nearly two years,Microsoft(MSFT) finally reported quarterly revenue growth during the second quarter of 2017. In many ways, Microsoft's performance during the second quarter is a peek into what the future holds for the company. Revenue from the Productivity and Business Process segment and the Intelligent Cloud segment was up10%during the quarter, while More Personal Computing declined by 5% due to lower phone revenues.Microsoft raced past analyst estimates, posting adjusted EPS of83cents on the back of $26.07 billion in revenues, while the market was expecting 79 cents in earnings and $25.3 billion in revenues.The above-average results were made possible by stellar performance from Microsoft's cloud business, whose annualized commercial cloud revenue run rate has now exceeded $14 billion. Microsoft takes the revenue earned from cloud products (Office 365, Microsoft Azure, Dynamics 365) in the final month of the quarter, and multiplies it by 12 to get to its annual cloud run rate. During the first quarter, Microsoft said that its cloud run rate exceeded $13 billion, and in the second quarter it has gone past $14 billion. This means Microsoft's cloud properties brought nearly $1.08 billion in September 2017 and $1.16 billion December 2017.makeArticleAd();Microsoft's cloud-based businesses are still growing sequentially, which is great news for the company as it transitions from being Windows-dependent to being cloud-reliant. Office 365 commercial revenue grew 47% during the quarter, while Office consumer products and cloud services revenue increased by 22%.Office and related products, especially the cloud-delivered lineup, has been growing in a very strong way for the company. Microsoft has steadily built its lead in this segment, and if the above-47% growth of the last six quarters continues, it will be very difficult for the competition to catch up.Microsoft Azure has been clocking triple-digit growth rates for the past several quarters, and in the second quarter it came very close, posting 93% growth over the prior period. Microsoft noted that Azure compute usage has more than doubled during the quarter.Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud, the two forward-looking business streams that are based on cloud delivery, made $14.283 billion during the second quarter, nearly $2.5 billion more than the More Personal Computing segment that hosts Windows OEM, Phone and Gaming revenues. Though Windows OEM revenue increased by 5% during the quarter, Windows revenue are on shaky grounds due to the steady decline of PC sales around the world. As smartphones and tablets keep replacing PCs, the Windows operating system, which has a negligible presence in the mobile world, does not have a great future, at least in the short to medium-term.But second quarter results have already proved that Microsoft has successfully transitioned into a new era, where cloud, not Windows, dominates the revenue landscape. The company is now poised on the threshold of where CEO Satya Nadella wants it to ultimately go, and the next several quarters will make that transition even more pronounced.Disclosure:I have no positions in the stocks mentioned above and no intention to initiate a position in the next 72 hours.Start a free seven-day trial of Premium Membership to GuruFocus.Premium MembersThis article first appeared onGuruFocus."

Microsoft Corporation's Cloud-Computing Business Is Surging;1/28/2017;"Software giantMicrosoft's(NASDAQ: MSFT) stock rose about 2.3% on Friday after the   company reported better-than-expected fiscal 2017 second-quarter   results. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.83 on adjusted   revenue of $25.8 billion were 6% and 2%, respectively, better   than analysts' consensus estimate for the quarter.But there's a more interesting story from the quarter than the   company's market-beating financial results. Microsoft's   cloud-computing business, Azure, which competes directly withAmazon.com's(NASDAQ: AMZN) Amazon Web Services (AWS), saw its revenue   skyrocket 93%, or 95% in constant currency.Here's a look Azure's growth, and why it's important.makeArticleAd();Image source: Getty Images.About Azure's growthAzure is a cloud-computing business giving enterprise   customers scale and efficiency for secure server infrastructure   and cloud applications. And it's driving results for   Microsoft.With 93% year-over-year growth in revenue, Azure played an   important role in the growth in Microsoft's intelligent cloud   segment, which delivered $6.9 billion in revenue for the company   during the second quarter, up 8% year over year and 10% in   constant currency.Investors should take notice of this key growth driver for   Microsoft's intelligent cloud segment. Though Microsoft doesn't   break out Azure's exact revenue figures, or even Azure's   operating margin, there's no mistake that the intelligent cloud   segment to which Azure belongs is important to the company's   results. The overall segment accounted for 43% of Microsoft's   overall operating profits in Q2 -- a level that will likely grow   as Azure becomes a larger part of this segment.Big opportunityIf the performance of Amazon's AWS is any indication of the   potential for Azure, Microsoft's cloud-computing segment has a   promising future. Indeed, based on AWS' robust performance, Azure   has likely already morphed into a significant cash cow for   Microsoft.Amazon, which provides direct visibility into the financials   of its AWS unit, generates about 75% of its total operating   profits from the cloud-computing segment. Further, AWS is a   growth machine for Amazon. In Amazon's most recently reported   quarter, for instance, AWS operating income soared about 100%   year over year, to $861 million.Indeed, Microsoft seemed to confirm the profit-driving   characteristics of Azure in the company's second-quarter earnings   call. During the call, management said a 2 percentage point   year-over-year increase in its commercial cloud gross margin, to   48%, was ""largely driven by improvement in the Azure gross margin   percentage.""Azure. Image source: Microsoft.Azure's success is a particularly positive development for   Microsoft since management indicates that the segment's   performance carries over to the company's intelligent cloud   segment in its entirety. Microsoft CFO Amy Hood explained (via a   Reuterstranscript) this interlinking between Azure and other components of the   company's cloud segment:So, when I think about the material gross margin improvement     we saw on Azure, it continues the path we've actually been on.     Where we've been discussing, as you continue to see customers     ask for us and our help in managing their digital estate     consistently, securely, through one interface, you'll actually     see growth across all components of that cloud.It benefits margin, not just in Azure, but across, actually,     the entirety of the cloud.In other words, not only is Azure's revenue and profitability   increasing rapidly, but its impact on the company's overall   intelligent cloud business is growing. At this rate, Azure is   bound to have a meaningful impact on Microsoft's overall growth   in the coming years.10 stocks we like better than MicrosoftWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock       tip, it can pay to listen.

Why Microsoft Corporation Will Put $1 Billion Into Cyber-Security (MSFT);1/28/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMicrosoft Corporation(MSFT) will continue to sink large chunks of money to battlecyber-attacksover the next several years, as it has pledged to spend at least $1 billion every year to protect its users.makeArticleAd();That amount includes research and development to stay ahead of hackers, but it doesn't include any cash Microsoft might spend on acquisitions in the area of cyber-security.Microsoft Makes Ready For a Growing ThreatMicrosoft data suggests that two to three years ago, hackers attempted to carry out about 20,000 cyber-attacks each week. However, the firm states that the number of attempts is now up to between 600,000 and 700,000 per week.But the growing number of cyber-attack attempts isn't the only reason cyber-security is growing in importance.Microsoft Vice President of Security Bharat Shah toldReutersat the company's BlueHat conference in Israel that it's also important because of consumers' growing adoption of cloud services.Over a little more than two years, Microsoft has also acquired three firms with expertise in the area ofcyber-security. The company has bought startupAorato, which focuses on enterprise security, Adallom, a general cloud security company, andSecure Islands, maker of a technology for protection of data and files.Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Q2 Earnings: They're Good … Just Not GreatSecure Islands' technology has already been integrated into Microsoft's Azure Information Protection cloud offering.The Windows maker is also sinking money into cyber-security by making investments externally through its venture capital arm. The company has reportedly invested into three Israel-based firms. One of those investments was made just this week, with Microsoft investing an undisclosed amount into Illusive Networks.The firm is able to detect cyber-attacks through its deception technology, which some banks and retailers have already been using. Microsoft also said earlier this month that it had invested in Team8, the maker of Illusive Networks.Shah told Reuters that they don't currently plan to start using deception technology in any of its products, it does examine many different kinds of technologies that could be of use at some point.He also expects to move toward broadening non-password methods for user authentication.

Comparable-store sales growth fell to a 3% pace worldwide, down   from 5% over the prior 12 months. A major contributor to that   decline was falling customer traffic in the critical U.S. market   that pushed comps there down to a 3% pace from 4% in the prior   quarter. Executives noted that Starbucks still managed solid   growth ""in the face of a challenging environment for restaurant   retailers overall.""Those challenges will apparently continue, as the company   lowered its fiscal 2017 growth outlook to 9% at the midpoint of   guidance from the 10% it had projected in early December. Despite   the weaker outlook for the industry, Starbucks still plans to   open over 2,000 new locations this year on its way to expanding   its store base by 50% over the next five years.Microsoft beats expectationsMicrosoft was the best-performing stock on the Dow, up 2.35%   on the day, after the software giant announced surprisingly   strong earnings results. Revenue ticked up by 1% to $26.1   billion, while consensus estimates would have settled for closer   to $25.3 billion. The tech titan also outperformed on profit,   with $0.83 per share of earnings compared to expectations of   $0.79 per share.Image source: Getty Images.The company enjoyed steady growth in its office commercial   products and a 22% spike on the consumer side as the Office 365   subscriber base rose to 24.9 million from 24 million in the prior   quarter.Yet its cloud computing stole the show again, with a   near-doubling of Azure revenue helping the intelligent cloud   segment book 8% growth. ""We see strong demand for our cloud-based   services and are executing well on our long-term growth   strategy,"" Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood said in a press   release.Microsoft's PC business shrank, pulled down by a slump in   phone revenue, worse results out of the search engine business,   and a slight decline in Xbox sales. Yet management is optimistic   about its overall sales position. It forecast revenue of $23.5   billion at the midpoint of guidance next quarter, which beat Wall   Street analyst targets that averaged $22.7 billion.10 stocks we like better than MicrosoftWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Treasury bonds were stronger, the dollar was stronger, gold lost 0.1%. and crude oil reversed some of its recent strength by falling 1.1%. The drop in oil boosted theProShares UltraShort Crude Oil(NYSEARCA:SCO) recommended toEdgesubscribers to a 2.4% gain.Healthcare stocks led the way with a 0.8% gain while energy was the laggard, down 0.9%. A number of retailers were hit as well, withTarget Corporation(NYSE:TGT) losing its 200-week moving average for the first time since 2011, as Trump seemed to warm to the idea of a border tax that would increase the cost of goods sold.Intel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) gained 1.1% after reporting a fourth-quarter earnings per share beat 4% ahead of estimates thanks to results from its cloud computing group.Microsoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) gained 2.4% after reporting a top-and-bottom line beat as analysts remain excited about the company's cloud business.Alphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) fell 1.4% after missing on earnings.10 Stocks to Buy That Already Make America GreatOn the downside,JetBlue Airways Corporation(NASDAQ:JBLU) fell 6.9% after suffering a downgrade from analysts at Argus citing valuation concerns after a rally over the last three months.

The unemployment rate has compressed in recent months, standing at 4.7% in January, as the job market tightens.

Earnings Growth Returns, Will it Continue?;1/27/2017;"makeZacksArticleAd();Corporate earnings have started growing again, with growth in the ongoing Q4 earnings season on track to reach its highest level in 8 quarters. Growth is still modest - the Q4 earnings growth is currently on track to reach +5.2% and the final growth tally for the quarter will at best be a couple of percentage points higher. But this is still a notable improvement over what we were experiencing in the recent past.Please recall that earnings growth turned positive only in 2016 Q3, having declined in each of the preceding 5 quarters, as the chart below of year-over-year earnings growth for the S&P 500 index shows.Positive surprises, particularly on the earnings front, are tracking below other historical periods at this stage. We will see if this trend continues this week as we enter the heart of the earnings season, with more 400 companies coming out with quarterly results, including 106 S&P 500 members.Q4 Scorecard(as of January 27, 2017)We have crossed the one-third mark in the Q4 reporting cycle, with results from 170 S&P 500 members, or 33.9% of the index's total membership, already out. Total earnings for these 170 index members are up +6.0% on +3.1% higher revenues, with 64.1% beating EPS estimates and 54.7% coming ahead of top-line expectations.The table below provides the current Q4 scorecardThe charts below provide a comparison of the results thus far with what we have seen from this same group of 170 S&P 500 members in other recent periods.As you can see, the Q4 growth pace is notably tracking above what we had seen from the same group of 170 index members in other recent periods. But positive surprises (right-hand chart above) are tracking on the low side at this stage, particularly on the earnings front. The 64.1% proportion of Q4 companies beating EPS estimates compares to 81.2% in the preceding quarter, 76.3% as the 4-quarter average and 72.2% as the 12-quarter average. Positive revenue surprises are tracking below what we had seen from the same group of companies in Q3, but are roughly in-line with historical periods.The chart below compares the proportion of companies reporting Q4 results that are beatingbothEPS and revenue estimates with what this same group of companies had reported in other recent periods.Standout SectorsSectors with strong growth and better than expected results include the Finance, Technology, Construction, Industrial Products, Basic Materials and Consumer Discretionary sectors. Positive surprises for all of these sectors are tracking above the index level.Finance: With results from 57.7% of the sector's market cap in the S&P 500 index already out, total earnings for the sector are up +11.3% from the same period last year on +3.1% higher revenues, with +66.7% beating EPS estimates and +46.2% beating top-line estimates.This is a better growth performance than we have seen from the sector in other recent periods, as the comparison charts below show. Please note that positive surprises are as hard to come by in the Finance sector as they are elsewhere.Strong Finance sector growth is a big driver of the aggregate growth performance for the S&P 500 index as a whole. Excluding the Finance sector, the Q4 growth pace still compares favorably with other recent periods, but a lot less so, as the right-hand chart below shows.Technology: For the Technology sector, we now have Q4 results from 59.6% of the sector's total market cap. Total earnings for these companies are up +7.2% from the same period last year on +4.9% higher revenues, with 69% beating EPS estimates and 82.8% beating revenue estimates.We will see what this week'sApple(AAPL) andFacebook(FB) reports bring, but the sector's Q4 earnings and revenue growth is about in-line with what we saw from this same group of Tech companies in the preceding quarter (2016 Q3), though it is notably tracking above the 4-quarter and 12-quarter averages. With respect to positive surprises, Tech companies appear to be beating EPS estimates at a lower proportion than has historically been the case, though the proportion of positive earnings surprises remains above the index level. Revenue surprises, on the other hand, are tracking notably above historical periods.Key Reports for the Week of January 30thTuesday - 1/31/2017: Monday has a relatively light reporting docket, but Tuesday is very busy with more than 90 companies reporting results, including 33 S&P 500 members (of which 22 are in the morning). The focus will be onApple(AAPL), which reports after the market's close.Exxon(XOM),Pfizer(PFE),Eli Lilly(LLY) andUnder Armour(UAA) will be the key reports in the morning.Apple is expected to report $3.22 in earnings on $76.2 billion in revenues, which compare to $3.28 on $75.9 billion in revenues in the year-earlier period. The stock is up +9.7% since November 8th vs. +7% for the S&P 500 index and +6.1% for the Zacks Technology sector. December quarter estimates have been stable in recent days, though they have come down for the March quarter.Wednesday - 2/01/2017:Facebook(FB) is the most high profile of the 27 index members reporting results today (it will report after the market's close). The focus will be on the social media giant's ad revenues and daily active users, but the current Zacks Consensus EPS estimate is $1.13 on $8.4 billion in revenues. This compares to EPS of $0.59 on $5.8 billion in revenues in the year-earlier period. Estimates have modestly inched up in recent days. The stock has performed in-line with the Zacks Tech sector since November 8th, up +6.3% vs. +6.1%.Thursday - 2/02/2017: On a busy reporting day with 35 index members coming out with Q4 results (23 in the morning & 12 after the market's close), the notable reports are fromCME Group(CME) andInternational Paper(IP) in the morning andAmazon(AMZN) in the evening.Amazon is expected to report $1.41 in earnings (up +41.5% year over year) on $44.8 billion in revenues (up +25.4% in revenues). Estimates have come down ahead of the earnings report, but Amazon has never really been an EPS story; it is all top-line growth, particularly gains in its cloud business, Amazon Web Services. Amazon, along withMicrosoft(MSFT), which came out with impressive cloud numbers of its own, has staked a well-regarded claim to leadership in the fast-growing cloud business. The stock has been a strong performer over the past year, up +31.4% vs. +12.4% gain for the Zacks Retail sector.Friday - 2/03/2017:AutoNation(AN) andHershey(HSY) are the notable reports today, both in the morning.Q4 Expectations As a WholeFor Q4 as a whole, combining the actual results from the 170 S&P 500 members that have reported with estimates for the still-to-come 330 companies, total earnings are expected to be up +5.2% from the same period last year on +4.0% higher revenues. This would follow the +3.8% growth in Q3 earnings on +2.3% higher revenues, the first instance of positive earnings growth for the index after five quarters of back-to-back declines. Comparisons for the Energy sector, a big driver of the earnings recession, turn positive in Q4, with the sector's earnings growth turning positive for the first time after 8 quarters of declines.The chart below shows the Q3 earnings growth contrasted with declines in the preceding 5 quarters. As you can see in the chart below, the growth pace is expected to ramp up in 2017.The table below shows the summary picture Q4 contrasted with what was actually achieved in the preceding quarter.For a complete analysis of the Q4 earnings season, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report -3 Takeaways from the Q4 Earnings SeasonNote: Sheraz Mian heads the Zacks Equity Research department and is a well-regarded expert of aggregate earnings.

Microsoft's Surface Lineup Is Now a $4.3 Billion Business;1/27/2017;"Surface lineup. Image source: Microsoft.WhenMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) first launched itsSurface lineup in 2012, I had my doubts as to whether or not the company could   successfully jump into hardware. The company has had its fair   share of missteps for the Surface, but it's safe to say at this   point that Microsoft has exceeded most early expectations for its   first-party devices. Microsoft has adapted quickly to flops like   Surface RT, which resulted in a $900 million writedown back in   2013, and pushed forward with expanding the portfolio, most   recently with Surface Studio.makeArticleAd();Surface revenue during the fourth quarter came in at $1.3   billion, representing a sequential increase of over 40% for the   busy holiday shopping season. That's enough to bring full-year   2016 Surface revenue to an impressive $4.3 billion.Data source: Microsoft. Chart by author. Calendar years     shown.It also probably helps that CEO Satya Nadella is a stronger   leader than his predecessor, even though the Surface strategy was   conceived under Steve Ballmer. The push with Surface hardware   created a rift between Ballmer and Bill Gates, and may have also   contributed to Ballmer's ouster.Out with the old, in with the newDuring the earnings call, Nadella noted that Surface has   enjoyed three consecutive quarters of 25%-plus growth. Sales mix   is transitioning toward the newer products like Surface Pro 4 and   Surface Book, and Surface 3 sales are expected to continue   winding down.The customer reception for Surface Studio in particular has   been strong, which is especially impressive for two reasons:   Surface Studio was not widely available during the fourth   quarter, and it's extremely expensive, starting at $3,000.   Inventories for the new all-in-one should start improving this   quarter as production ramps up.Taking a bite out of AppleMore broadly, Surface is but part of a bigger push among the   Windows PC crowd to take a bite out ofApple's(NASDAQ: AAPL) turf: the premium PC market. Surface is doing   well, but it was never expected to comprise a large chunk of the   Windows ecosystem; that's what original equipment manufacturers   (OEMs) are for.CFO Amy Hood said that Microsoft's ""OEM non-pro performance   should grow ahead of the market, due to strength in the premium   device category."" In other words, high-end consumer-oriented PCs   made by Microsoft's partners are gaining traction in the market,   at a time when Apple lost PC market share for thefirst three quartersof 2016 (Apple reports fourth-quarter results next week). OEM   non-pro revenue grew 5% last quarter, outpacing the broader PC   market.Surface is profitable, tooIt's also worth pointing out that Surface is now profitable on   a gross margin basis (up 6% last quarter in dollar terms), so   those revenue gains are starting to enjoy some operating   leverage.Unfortunately, currency headwinds are adversely impacting   profitability, as Surface gross margin was up 17% on a constant   currency basis in dollar terms. There's a big discrepancy between   the currency impacts on revenue (2 percentage points) compared to   gross margin (11 percentage points), which is due to the fact   that Surface devices are manufactured in Asia and the Surface   cost structure is more vulnerable to currency fluctuations.Still, you have to give Nadella credit for being able to take   a struggling segment conceived under Ballmer and turn it into a   profitable $4.3 billion business within just a couple of   years.10 stocks we like better than MicrosoftWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Cisco Snatches IPO Baby from the Arms of Wall Street;1/27/2017;"makeZacksArticleAd();On January 24,Cisco (CSCO)revealed they were buying a private company called AppDynamics for $3.7 billion. The funny thing is that the little guy already had a stock symbol picked out, APPD, for its scheduled IPO this week. Talk about a buzzer-beater.But Cisco is also viewed as paying a hefty premium for a software firm specializing in a niche called application performance management (APM). Why would they do that?According to Pacific Crest Securities, ""AppDynamics is a natural fit for Cisco's portfolio, in our view, given its ability to monitor legacy applications and infrastructure and its growing presence in next-generation application deployments.""AppDynamics' software stack now allows Cisco's product portfolio to extend its insight across the network, security and application layers. The acquisition broadens Cisco's software portfolio as Cisco attempts to diversify its revenue base with more subscription and recurring revenue.""Tech Titans Clash With War Chests of CashThis was precisely a theme that I discussed on the Zacks Ultimate webinar January 12: tech titans like Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), IBM, Facebook (FB) and Alphabet (GOOGL) ""battling for innovation"" with war chests of cash to scoop up ""off-the-shelf"" technology before the other guy.And MarketWatch reported in a story on January 25 that there is a trend of the smaller companies gladly accepting these buyouts to avoid the market volatility of the public markets. ThinkTwilio (TWLO)there. Here were a couple of interesting lines from the story by Caitlin Huston...""Just last week, SimpliVity, a software company, took a big valuation cut after it agreed to be bought by Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) for $650 million in cash, compared with a $1 billion private valuation.""Cisco and HPE show that large legacy tech companies are willing to swoop in to acquire startups, but the wide range of potential outcomes could lead to startups trying to stay private another year,"" said Max Wolff, market strategist at 55 Capital Partners. The top-tier of unicorn companies, such as SnapChat and Airbnb are not as affected, he added.Stifel: Potential Takeout Candidates After APPD DealCourtesy of TheFly.com...Cisco's acquisition of AppDynamics is a sign that the wave of Software deal activity in 2016 has carried over into the new year, Stifel analyst Brad Reback tells investors in a research note. He believes the deal bodes well for the small- and mid-cap names across his firm's coverage list, including potential consolidation candidates such as Barracuda (CUDA), ChannelAdvisor (ECOM), FireEye (FEYE), HubSpot (HUBS), Paycom (PAYC), Paylocity (PCTY), Proofpoint (PFPT), SecureWorks (SCWX), Splunk (SPLK), Tableau (DATA), Ultimate Software (ULTI), Veeva (VEEV) and Zendesk (ZEN). He notes that AppDynamics most directly competes against other application performance management vendors such as New Relic (NEWR) and privately-held Dynatrace.Death By AmazonThis was my theme for the Zacks Ultimate webinar earlier this month. You can watch all or part of it below in the player, and there's no sales pitch. This was premium content for our ZU members that we wanted to share with a wider audience because we thought it was so good.While I've been furiously researching the ""Amazon Effect"" onmobile commerce, entrepreneurship, and public companies like Macy's for the past 2 years, I can't take credit for the ""Death By Amazon"" tag.That comes from Bespoke Investment Group who actually created an index to follow the public company impact of Amazon's disruptive model as it has grown at exponential scale. I show their chart in the webinar.And my latest research project is focused on Facebook advertising which grew 55% to $26.5 billion last year and will add another $10 billion this year.Facebook Ads are truly an economic phenomenon because they are actually expanding the pie that Google Adwords created with PPC (pay per click).In other words, just like the ""Gig Economy"" creates jobs the government doesn't know about, the ""GAF (Google-Amazon-Facebook) Economy"" is creating thousands of small businesses that you maybe didn't know about.Exploring the GAF EconomyCheck out the webinar below where I also had a great discussion with my colleague Eric Dutram, Zacks ETF Strategist, as his topic -- the Internet of Things -- fit in perfectly with mine.And I highlight 4 areas of disruption after I studied the investment approach of VC Chris Sacca of lowercase capital who hit grand slams with Twitter, Uber, Instagram and Twilio.Kevin Cook is a Senior Stock Strategist for Zacks Investment Research where he runs theTAZR Traderservice.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The Cloud Drives Technology Stocks This Quarter;1/27/2017;"Analysts and experts have talked at length about the importance of cloud computing and how it would transform the technology sector. But the sense of waiting that underpinned such discussions is now giving way to a sense of arrival.Several factors are making cloud computing a reality today, the most important of which are an awareness of the resultant cost reductions, awareness of the economic value of processing ever-increasing volumes of data, and recognition of the advantages of sharing resources and having anytime anywhere access to data and information.Of course, along with all these advantages comes concerns related to privacy and security, which have been further exacerbated by government snooping, gag orders and orders to turn over data in private individual devices or in servers on foreign soil that have in turn made individuals and corporations wary about adopting the cloud.But technology companies are fighting it out. MicrosoftMSFTfor one has strongly resisted government demands as have AppleAAPLand AmazonAMZN. Alphabet'sGOOGLGoogle has also been vocal in its opposition. It makes perfect sense when you consider that these are some of the biggest cloud computing stocks that also offer computing and other devices. So they have vested interests at both ends of the networks.Other players with similar interests are chip makers like IntelINTC, NVIDIANVDA, Qualcomm and Advanced Micro DevicesAMD; networking companies like Cisco and Juniper; and software/service companies like IBM and Oracle.Here's a brief glimpse of three cloud companies that just reported December quarter results:IntelIntel's results this quarter were driven by both the PC and data center businesses. The PC strength was seasonal and unlikely to be sustained.Although non-volatile memory had the strongest growth rate of 24.8% and will grow even stronger this year, it currently contributes a lower share of revenue, which equates to fewer incremental dollars. Also, the business is poised to benefit from Intel's strength in the server market.Data center revenue growth of 8% year over year was helped by platform volume growth of 3% and platform price increase of 4%. Intel has new products in the pipeline and will also be integrating some technology it acquired through Altera, so this year may be less disappointing than the last when enterprise softness skewed expectations.MicrosoftMicrosoft has become a cloud-focused company, impressing analysts and investors alike. The company is making the most of legacy workloads that use its software and its all-new Windows OS, while leveraging Office productivity software and enterprise relationships to post record growth in cloud revenue.The company reported solid cloud results, with Azure revenue growing 93% (95% in constant currency) and compute usage doubling year over year. Its cloud productivity business also saw strong growth: Office 365 commercial revenue grew 47% (49% in constant currency) with seat growth of 37% and monthly active iOS and Android devices more than doubling to 65 million, Office 365 consumer revenue grew 22% (21% in constant currency) with seat growth of 20.9%.Dynamics 365 paid seats also more than doubled. Nadella promised commercial cloud annualized revenue runrate of $20.0 billion in 2018 and last quarter's $14.0 billion means that Microsoft is definitely on track to beat or exceed the target.AlphabetAlphabet doesn't break out its cloud revenue separately although independent market research data indicates that it is well behind market leader Amazon and even runners up Microsoft. In fact after the December quarter results some analysts have started saying that Microsoft has also started pulling away from the pack in its chase of Amazon.Alphabet's growth should not be discounted however because while cloud and hardware are lumped together right now, its common knowledge that most of its new hardware has been unavailable for a lot of the time. So the 62% growth in this segment seems to be less on account of hardware sales and more of an indication of strength it is seeing in the cloud.CFO Ruth Porat has said that cloud, hardware and YouTube subscriptions will be ""major revenue drivers for Google in the next several years."" This will of course require capital investment, something the company can afford given the way the search business continues to rake in cash. Capex was around $3.08 billion last quarter, that's nearly up by a billion dollars and will mostly be spent on data centers to support its cloud business.Now See Our Private Investment IdeasWhile the above ideas are being shared with the public, other trades are hidden from everyone but selected members.

The company will report the results of the transition period in the first 10Q of fiscal 2018.The new company called Dell Technologies holds approximately 80% of VMware shares, which were earlier held by its parent EMC.Our TakeVMware remains one of the leading companies in the virtualization and cloud computing market.  The company's innovative product pipeline and robust international sales are expected to drive overall results. Additionally, the company continues to make strategic acquisitions and ink partnerships with the likes of Amazon.com Inc'sAMZN, AWS and International Business Machines CorporationIBM.

Samsung (SSNLF) Expected to Launch Galaxy S8 on March 29;1/27/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWith the official Galaxy Note 7 battery review out of the way, everyone has been waiting forSamsung Electronics Co Ltd(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) to release the new Galaxy S8. Samsung still isn't saying anything, but clues have been building that it will be later than normal. NowVentureBeatsays it has the first photos of the elusive smartphone as well as an exact Galaxy S8 launch date.makeArticleAd();Source: SamsungSamsung's well-publicized disaster with the Galaxy Note 7 had a big ripple effect on the Galaxy S8.First, the company had to identify - without question - what had caused Galaxy Note 7 batteries to burst into flames. Then it had to pinpoint a fail-safe solution to the problem. After that, it had to hold an event where it publicly reviewed its findings and outlined the steps it had taken to ensure it never happens again. Thatevent took place last week.Galaxy S8 Launch Pushed Back by Battery ConcernsAs part of the battery investigation, Samsung also had to take measures to ensure the Galaxy S8 would not have similar problems, and that would have involved delayed finalization of the battery and related components. And you can bet the company has taken testing of the battery on its new flagship smartphone to new levels.As a result, it seemed likely the Galaxy S8 launch date would be pushed from it's traditional Mobile World Congress unveiling in February. Samsung confirmed this during last week's event.7 Stocks to Buy That Could Double by 2018The Guardian, citing anonymous sources close to Samsung, pointed to alate March release date. Yesterday,VentureBeat'sEvan Blassclaimed to have specifics, saying the Galaxy S8 launch will take place at a Samsung Unpacked event in New York City on March 29.Galaxy S8 DetailsTheVentureBeatreport also includes many technical details about SSNLF's new flagship handset(s), including photos.As has been speculated, it appears that this year both Galaxy S8 smartphones will feature a curved ""Edge"" Super AMOLED display, but both will also lose the Home button so nearly the entire front is display - the camera remains at top. As a result, even though the overall dimensions stay roughly the same, both new smartphones will have larger displays than the Galaxy Note 7: 5.8-inches and 6.2-inches.The fingerprint sensor has been moved to the back, and high tech biometrics are supplemented by an iris scanner. The charge port is the new USB-C standard, base storage moves to 64GB (with SD card expansion still offered) and unlikeApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL), Samsung will reportedly keep the headphone jack.By connecting to an optional dock, the Galaxy S8 will be able to be used as an Android computer. And it will feature Bixby, theadvanced AI personal assistantSamsung gained when it purchased Viv in October.Apple Inc. New iPads Might Be Late to the Party (AAPL)Interestingly,VentureBeatsays the price of both models - which it says will go on sale April 21 - will be €100 (roughly $100) more than last year's models.The Importance of the Galaxy S8 LaunchIt can't be understated how critical this release is to SSNLF. After recalling 3 million Galaxy Note 7s', its reputation took a serious blow. Apple will be pulling out all the stops with the iPhone 8 later this year, as it celebrates the iPhone's 10th anniversary and mounts a major campaign to convince upgraders.Alphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) released its first Google-branded smartphone in the Pixel Phone at the height of the Galaxy Note 7 debacle, and a follow-up is expected this year.Both rivals will be gunning to boost sales at Samsung's expense.In the last quarterly sales report (from the end of October), Samsung's smartphone sales marketshare haddropped 13.5%compared to the previous year. The next quarter's numbers could be even worse. If the Galaxy S8 launch flops, Samsung's time at the top of the smartphone sales charts would likely be over.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace3 Things Apple Inc.

The Gap Widens After Dow 20,000: How Much Should You Worry?;1/27/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTheDow Jones Industrial Averagefinally broke above the 20,000 level Wednesday, which has no fundamental or technical meaning, but it's an interesting benchmark. The only real message from the new record is that traders continue to bet on the so-called ""Trump rally.""makeArticleAd();The gains in the market aren't just based on expectations for spending, tax cuts and deregulation from the Republican congress and administration. Growth in earnings has been strong even when adjusted for the one-off windfalls in the financial sector. This quarter's year-over-year growth rate will likely hit expectations for a 5% gain.The real question isn't whether there is continued improvement in the economy, but whether asset prices have gotten ahead of those reasonable estimates. Investors must be worried that evidence that the gap between asset values and what we actually know about the Trump administration's plans is probably widening too much.As you can see in the next chart, the adjusted price-earnings ratio (blue line) is above its 2008 highs. In fact, besides the ""dot-com"" bubble of the late 1990s, the adjusted P/E ratio hasn't been higher since ""Black Tuesday"" in the early 20th century.The 3 Best Sector ETFs to Buy for a Profitable 2017Traders should be careful, however, not to try and derive a timing signal from this ratio. What it really means is that future growth expectations are extremely elevated, which have historically been disappointed.S&P 500 P/E ratio (blue line) versus SPDR S&P 500 ETF (orange line)The reason we care about this measure is that is helps us to understand whether expectations may be gapping away from what we actually know or can reasonably estimate about the future, which creates higher levels of risk. It's certainly not the case that the Trump administration can't help the economy, but usually government intervention takes a long time to come to fruition, and congress hasn't been that good at ""picking winners"" in the past.Who is at risk? The fact remains that changes to international trade relationships carry uncertain risks. The Dow hit its new benchmark mostly becauseBoeing Co(NYSE:BA) reported earnings above expectations.However, one-third of the company's revenue and 40% of its backlog are international customers. This quarter's earnings were really great, but can that continue if reciprocal trade protection strategies are deployed in Asia, North America and Europe?Should You Buy Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock? 3 Pros, 3 ConsMost of the risks posed by the gap between current expectations and what we actually ""know"" don't translate very well into timing signals. Instead, what we can anticipate is that volatility will probably remain relatively high. This is not a bad thing for option traders.Wider price swings are frustrating when they move against us, but the potential for bigger, faster gains in our favor should offset that issue. The breakout in theS&P 500this week is legitimate. However, the likelihood that the trend will hit its price target this quarter is low.InvestorPlace advisors John Jagerson and S.

Tech ETFs to Watch Post Microsoft & Alphabet Results;1/27/2017;"After the closing bell on Thursday, a couple of tech biggest players like MicrosoftMSFTand AlphabetGOOGLreported their quarterly results. While Microsoft beat our estimates on earnings, Alphabet missed. Meanwhile, both tech titans topped our revenue estimates. This has put spotlight on technology ETFs for the coming days.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');Let's take a quick look on the major details of their earnings releases:Microsoft Earnings at A GlanceEarnings per share for fiscal second-quarter 2017 came in at 83 cents, easily outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 79 cents and improving 9% from the year-ago quarter. Revenues rose 2% year over year to $26.07 billion topping our estimate of $25.2 billion.The outperformance was credited to continued strength in the cloud business, particularly Azure, whose sales grew 93% from the year-ago period, as well as a stabilizing personal-computer market. Investors should note that Microsoft's total cloud business brought in about $6.86 billion in the fiscal second quarter and is on track to reach $20 billion in fiscal 2018.This clearly shows that Satya Nadella's efforts of turning around the business, and focusing on cloud services and mobile applications are paying off and bode well for the company's future growth (read:5 ETF Investment Ideas for 2017).Following the results, shares of the world's largest software maker rose 1.43% in after-market hours on elevated volumes. Currently, Microsoft carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) with a top VGM Style Score of A, suggesting that it is poised to outperform in the days ahead.Alphabet Earnings at A GlanceSearch engine kingpin Alphabet reported earnings per share of $7.56 in the fourth quarter, well below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.65. Revenues increased 22% year over year to $21.2 billion and outpaced our estimate of $20.6 billion.Fast-growing cloud-computing business and booming YouTube video advertising were behind the robust revenue performance. Aggregate paid clicks rose 36% year over year while cost per click dropped 15%.Given weaker-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings, Alphabet's shares tanked 2.5% in after-hours trading on elevated volumes. However, the dip could be a buying opportunity given that the stock has a solid Zacks Rank #2 with a top VGM Style Score of B (read:Will Q4 Earnings Strengthen Tech ETFs Further?).ETFs in FocusInvestors' seeking to bet on the earnings releases of these tech giants with lower risk could definitely look into the ETF world.

In the past year, Alibaba's growth has slowed down a little, but its stock still beat expectations at the New York Stock Exchange.Alibaba Diversifying Revenue SourcesAlibaba has diversified itsrevenuesourcing and has persuaded U.S. mega-retailersCostco Wholesale Corporation(COST) andMacy's Inc(M) to open online shops. The Chinese firm has even signed a $2.6-billion privatization deal withIntime Retail Group Co. and expanded its efforts to reach out to medium and small-sized enterprises, says Yibada.Nearly 650,000 American companies are already registered on Alibaba.com.

3 Big Stock Charts for Friday: Microsoft Corporation (MSFT), Starbucks Corporation (SBUX) and Intel Corporation (INTC);1/27/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe largest week of the earnings season closes out with some big names on Thursday asMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT),Starbucks Corporation(NASDAQ:SBUX) andIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) were among those providing their quarterly results after the market's close.makeArticleAd();Like so many this week, these three stocks were teetering on significant technical levels that combined with their earnings results will drive the trading activity for the next few weeks.Microsoft Corporation (MSFT)Microsoft shares are enjoying a bump this morning after better-than-expected results on the top and bottom line. The stock spent the past two days rallying ahead of the earnings report, breaking above their top Bollinger band.The break above the top band is now supported by the positive earnings, which means upside volatility should accelerate as shares are now moving to new all-time highs.3 Fast-Food Stocks That Are Sweating Bullets Thanks to McDonald'sIn addition to the short-term acceleration pattern, momentum indicators for the share movement are now moving higher, indicating that intermediate-term strength for the shares should improve.Slow and steady has been the pace for Microsoft as the stock is trading 24% higher over the last 12 months with lower average volatility than theS&P 500. Unlike most of the market, Microsoft was able to maintain its ascent over the past few months instead of consolidating, which has attracted longer-term investors as indicated by the increased volume.For now, the shares are likely to take a fast track higher, but the charts indicate that the longer-term upside potential for Microsoft remains bullish.Starbucks Corporation (SBUX)Starbucks will trade lower this morning after the company's earnings report fell short of expectations and the company lowered their forward-looking guidance.Shares of Starbucks had been working toward breaking out of their recent range with momentum building towards the $60 price level, a move that will reverse this morning. Traders will see a critical test this morning with shares trading just below the $56 level.The test comes in the form of the stock's intermediate-term trendlines. Currently, the 100- and 200-day moving averages are trading at the $56.02 and $55.58 levels respectively. These trendlines helped to form a tradable base for the stock in early January.A hold of this support level will indicate that the traders have an opportunity for a short-term trade from $56 back to $59. Failure to hold this intermediate support level will result in another round of selling that will target the $53.00 level.From a longer-term perspective, Starbucks does risk passing into a long-term bearish pattern with a few more closes below the $57 mark as this is where the stock's 20-month moving average resides. Long-term traders will be watching this as a signal to lighten-up on position in February.Intel Corporation (INTC)Like Microsoft, Intel provided a positive view to investors after the close as the company provided upbeat earnings and forward guidance as demand for PCs appears to be improving.Shares have been battling with the $38 level, which they are crossing back above this morning.  Intel has spent a long period lagging peer companies within the sector as theSemiconductor ETF(MUTF:SMH) has more than doubled Intel's 12 month performance.Bank of America Corp (BAC) Stock Is STILL Too Cheap to IgnoreNonetheless, Intel's breakout above will improve the longer-term outlook as the company is now breaking above its 2014 highs.Looking at the analyst recommendations for Intel, only 66% of those covering the stock have it ranked a buy.  This indicates that there is a good chance for Intel shares to see upgrades from the analyst community which will accelerate the rally.As of this writing, Johnson Research Group did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace7 Stocks to Buy That Could Double by 201810 High-Yield Dividend Stocks That Are SOMEHOW Still BargainsThe post3 Big Stock Charts for Friday: Microsoft Corporation (MSFT), Starbucks Corporation (SBUX) and Intel Corporation (INTC)appeared first onInvestorPlace."

Econ Data into Early Weekend Slumber;1/27/2017;"Friday, January 27, 2017makeArticleAd();Ahead of the bell for this Friday, we're seeing some of the vibrant activity from early in the week tamp down a bit. We see bland Q4 earnings released before the bell, along with worse-than-expected economic data. The S&P 500 is unched, Dow is down marginally and Nasdaq is up slightly. It's cloudy outside, too.Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for Q4 2016 came in far lower than analysts had expected at 1.9%. This is the first read, and obviously subject to revisions in subsequent reads. But it's also a big leg down from the 3.5% produced in Q3. Consumer spending was down a half of 1%, while the price index rose 2.1% and consumption was up 2.5%. But this 1.9% is a disappointment also in that we look to have ended 2016, on average, below 2% growth overall.Durable Goods was also down ahead of today's open, -0.4% compared to the +2% expected. This is a more volatile read traditionally, and last read we saw -4.8%. Ex-transportation was +0.5% and non-defense, ex-aircraft was +0.8%. We see clearly how big orders for things like airplanes affect these reads, and we got exactly that this time around.ChevronCVXmissed big on its Q4 earnings before the bell today. 22 cents per share was nearly two-thirds short of the 64 cents expected. Shares of the oil & gas supermajor are down 3% in the pre-market. ColgateCLmatched estimates on the bottom line while revenues missed, and AbbVie reported in-line $1.20 per share on lower quarterly sales, although Humira performed well.Yesterday afternoon we saw solid, if unspectacular, results from tech majors like MicrosoftMSFT, IntelINTCand AlphabetGOOGL. But none of these were enough to push markets higher this morning.

If MSFT's 1.7% premarket gain carries over into the open, the shares are poised to close out the week north of heavy 27 Jan. call open interest (roughly 13,000 contracts) at the $65 strike.What's more, there are more than 45,000 call contracts at this strike in the Feb. series, with little in the way of additional OI above $65, leaving the door open for additional gains if MSFT stock can close out strong today.Starbucks Corporation (SBUX)Starbucks' earnings werelacking that caffeinated buzzlast night. The coffee king's quarterly results of 52 cents per share were in-line with expectations, but revenue of $5.73 billion missed the consensus estimate of $5.85 billion in sales.In fact, sales growth was down across the board, with global same-store sales up only 3% versus expectations for 3.8% growth, and U.S. comparable-store sales rising 3% versus expectations for a 4% gain.Options traders seemed to have an inkling that things were amiss at Starbucks. Yesterday's volume came in at 397,000 contracts, with puts claiming 51% of the day's take. SBUX is off more than 4% near $56 per share in premarket action, placing the stock below peak 27 Jan. put OI of 18,000 contracts at the $56.50 strike.Looking out to Feb options, roughly 9,100 puts reside at the $55 strike, creating a potential area of options related support for SBUX stock. Given that the $54 region is home to long-term support/resistance, however, follow-through selling could push SBUX down for a retest of this area before the shares recover.Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ)Verizon is starving for growth. You only need to look at this week'squarterly earnings reportfor evidence of the company's troubles. And with its leading competitorAT&T Inc.(NYSE:T) looking to finalize itsTime Warner Inc.(NYSE:TWX) acquisition, Verizon needs to do something to spice things up.And Verizon appears to be doing just that, as the company is reportedly intalks for a merger dealwith privately held Charter Communications Inc. That said, no official offer has been made, contrary to earlier reports.The Boeing Co (BA) Stock Rally Is Looking A Little Too GreedyThe initial reaction to the news was mixed in the options pits. Volume rose to 327,000 contracts, with calls only scraping together 51% of the day's take. Many VZ options traders are likely still reeling from the stock's 4.4% post-earnings plunge, so enthusiasm surrounding a potential merger with not details is understandably muted.That said, calls are gaining the upper hand in the Feb. series. Currently, the put/call OI ratio for Feb. rests at 0.92, with the reading falling from its pre-earnings perch north of 1.00 this week. Any final deals or details on a Charter tie-up should prompt a surge in call speculation, if not arbitrage plays by VZ options traders.As of this writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 High-Yield Dividend Stocks That Are SOMEHOW Still Bargains5 Funds That Could Double Your Retirement Nest EggThe postFriday's Vital Data: Microsoft Corporation (MSFT), Starbucks Corporation (SBUX) and Verizon Communications Inc.

Microsoft's second-quarter fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings of 83 cents and revenues $26.07 billion easily beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate.

After a six-month delay, Nintendo has now officiallylaunchedits blockbuster hit game, Pokémon Go in South Korea, on both Alphabet'sGOOGLPlay Store and Apple Inc.'sAAPLiOS store. Per media reports, Nintendo's Pokémon Go works with Google Maps, which has ""limited access"" in South Korea. Niantic had earlier sought permission from the South Korean government for access to Korean maps, which was flatly refused. Google had not agreed to South Korean government's demand to ""blur"" sensitive locations like government buildings on Maps.Reportedly, the denial stemmed from the fact that South Korea remains concerned about its national security. It doesn't share warm ties with its neighbor, North Korea. The simmering border tension between the two nations has led the South Korean government to disallow storage of detailed maps of the country on any other servers except those in South Korea, add media reports.It remains unknown how Niantic, the firm which developed Pokémon Go, bypassed the Maps issue, add media reports. Niantic chose to remain silent on this issue during the press conference it held in Seoul on Jan 23, 2017.Nintendo carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The success of Pokémon Go helped the company's share price. Over the past one year, its shares are up 55.86% compared with ZacksToys/Games/ Hobby/Productsindustry's gain of 18.42%.3. Meanwhile, Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg in a post announced that ex-Xiaomi vice president, Hugo Barra will spearhead all the company's VR initiatives as well as the Oculus unit. Zuckerberg further added ""Hugo shares my belief that virtual and augmented reality will be the next major computing platform. They'll enable us to experience completely new things and be more creative than ever before. Hugo is going to help build that future, and I'm looking forward to having him on our team.""Facebook had acquired Oculus for $2 billion in 2014. With Oculus, the company is trying to fuel its ambitious AR/VR efforts. Zuckerberg has time and again mentioned that VR is the next big business opportunity. Facebook has been pumping ample resources to boost its VR efforts. A few days back, Zuckerberg said that Facebook was going to spend over $3 billion over the next 10 years.However, Oculus has beenslappedwith a $2 billion lawsuit filed by video game company, ZeniMax. Zuckerberg appeared in a Dallas courtroom to testify against the allegations. Apparently, Zuckerberg has denied all allegations and stressed that ""The idea that Oculus technology is based on someone else's is just wrong.""At present, Facebook has a Zacks Rank #2.  In the past one year, Facebook's shares have generated a return of 39.92%, compared with the ZacksInternet Servicesindustry's gain of 19.39%.PerformanceThe following table shows the price movement of the major video game companies over both the past five trading days as well as the last six months:CompanyLast 5 DaysLast 6 MonthsATVI1.34%-5.03%EA1.68%6.32%GLUU6.98%-3.77%MSFT2.50%13.23%NTES6.00%23.20%TTWO4.15%33.77%ZNGA-2.65%-10.76%Over the last five trading sessions, Glu Mobile IncGLUUwas up 6.98% whereas Zynga IncZNGAwas down 2.65%.Over the last six-month period, Take Two InteractiveTTWOsurged the most (33.77%).

Futures Trim Gains as Economic Growth Slows;1/27/2017;"Dow and S&P 500 futures are straddling the flatline after having returned their very modest gains into Friday's open after data that showed economic growth slowed to an annual rate of just 1.9% rattling Wall Street investors. Nasdaq futures remain higher with a comfortable gain of 0.18%.Additionally, durable goods orders fell 0.4% last month, well below expectations for an increase of 2.6%. Excluding a 2.2% decline in transportation-related orders, durable goods orders increased an as-expected 0.5%, while November was revised higher to +1.0% from +0.5% previously.Leading into this morning's data, futures were marginally higher as the markets continued to digest a flurry of fourth quarter results. Starbucks (SBUX) and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) reported mixed results, Microsoft's (MSFT) results came in well above expectations, while American Airlines (AAL) crushed earnings estimates, driving the entire airline sector higher inpremarket trading.makeArticleAd();In related markets, oil futures are defensive as rising U.S. production continues to weigh on the energy market. The Baker Hughes oil rig count later this afternoon will likely show that U.S. oil and natural gas rigs increased as producers capitalize on the recent gain inoil prices.

"Intel (INTC) Beats on Q4 Earnings; '17 View Lacks Shine";1/27/2017;"Intel CorpINTCreported fourth-quarter 2016 non-GAAP earnings of 79 cents per share, which increased almost 4% from the year-ago quarter but declined 1.3% sequentially. Earnings per share (EPS) beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4 cents.makeArticleAd();The strong year-over-year earnings growth was driven by 9.8% increase in revenues, which totaled $16.37 billion and comfortably surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of nearly $15.80 billion. Revenues increased 3.8% sequentially.The robust year-over-year revenue growth came on the back of impressive results from the Client Computing, Data Center and Internet-of-Things groups, which contributed to almost 88.7% of total revenue in the reported quarter.Intel Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS     SurpriseIntel Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS   Surprise|Intel Corporation QuoteIn 2016, EPS was $2.72 as compared with $2.49 reported in 2015. Revenues increased 7.5% year over year to $59.49 billion. The company's capital expenditure jumped more than 31% to $9.6 billion reflecting continuing investments on new high-performance chip technology for the emerging markets of Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI) and autonomous vehicle.Moreover, Intel's 2017 capital expenditure forecast exhibits continuing investments on the emerging markets. However, revenue growth is expected to remain flat, which will weigh on profitability.We note that Intel has underperformed the ZacksSemiconductor Generalindustry in the past one year. While the company's shares gained 25.9%, the industry returned 52.4% in the same period. Moreover, we don't expect the shares to rebound in the near term.Segment Revenue DetailsClient Computing Group(55.8% of revenues) - Intel bundles PCs, notebooks, 2-in-1s, tablets and other computing devices under the Client segment, which actually helps comparison with the PC market numbers provided by IDC and Gartner.Revenues increased 4.3% year over year and 2.7% sequentially to $9.13 billion. The growth rate was encouraging as it continued to beat PC market trends. We believe Intel is gaining share in the emerging, connected and computing devices market, which is neutralizing declines in the core PC market.Overall unit volumes were down 4% sequentially and 7% on a year-over-year basis. PC volumes decreased 4% while notebook volumes were flat compared with the year-ago quarter. Tablet volumes continued to decline in the quarter.Average selling prices (ASPs) increased 6% and 7% on a sequential and year-over-year basis, respectively. The year-over-year increase came from both PC and notebooks, which were up 2% and 3%, respectively.Data Center Group(28.5% of revenues) - Revenues increased 8.4% year over year and 2.8% sequentially to $4.67 billion. Data Center volume declined 3% sequentially but gained 3% from the year-ago quarter. ASP increased 6% sequentially and 4% from year-ago quarter.We believe that growing demand for server chips that are used in the data centers from the cloud-based service providers like Amazon.comAMZN, AlphabetGOOGLand MicrosoftMSFTis a key catalyst for Intel.Internet of Things Group(4.4% of revenues) - Revenues jumped 16.2% from the year-ago quarter and 5.4% quarter over quarter to $726 million. The growth was backed by strength in retail, video and transportation applications.Non-Volatile memory solutions group(5% of revenues) - Revenues jumped 24.8% year over year and 25.7% sequentially to $816 million.Memory is a commodity-type business, so prices vary widely depending on available supply. Intel is expected to launch data storage products based on 3D XPoint technology in 2017, which is encouraging in our view.These products bring the kind of differentiation to Intel's memory business that could help it generate stable memory demand and pricing in an otherwise commodity-type market. The goal is to take these technologies to Data Center and enterprise customers, where they will generate solid revenue and profits. Further, XPoint is likely to have broader application.Intel Security Group(3.4% of revenues) - Revenues grew 7.4% year over year and 2.4% sequentially to $550 million.In September, Intel announced that it is divesting a majority stake in the division to alternative asset fund manager TPG. The deal valued at $4.2 billion includes an equity value of approximately $2.2 billion for the security division in addition to net debt of approximately $2 billion.Intel anticipates realizing a pre-tax gain on the sale of roughly $500 million when the transaction closes in second-quarter 2017.Programmable solutions group(2.6% of revenues) - The Altera business is now the Programmable Solutions Group, declining 1.2% sequentially and generated $420 million in revenues in the last quarter.Intel also has a residual segment, which includes results of operations from New Technology Group and other adjustments. The segment reported revenues of $65 million up 10.2% from the year-ago quarter and 47.7% on a sequential basis.Operating DetailsThe gross margin for the quarter was 63.1%, which contracted 160 basis points (bps) sequentially and 170 bps year over year, better than guided 63%. The contraction resulted from higher factory start-up costs (primarily on 10 nm), higher product warranty, and IP charges and investments on the Non-Volatile Memory Solutions Group as well as Altera acquisition.Research & development (R&D) and marketing, general & administrative (MG&A) increased 3.8% year over year and 7.2% sequentially to $5.44 billion, lower than management's guided range of $5.2 billion. As percentage of revenues, R&D and MG&A declined 190 bps on a year-over-year basis but increased 100 bps sequentially in the quarter.The operating margin was 29.9%, down 270 bps sequentially but up 20 bps year over year. Segment wise,Client Computing groupoperating margin were 38.6% up 750 bps on a year-over-year basis and 120 bps sequentially. The massive expansion came on the back of lower investments and declining costs.Data Center groupoperating margin was 40.3%, as compared with 50.5% in the year-ago quarter and 46.5% in the previous quarter. The decline can be attributed to higher investments on Broadwell, the first 14-nanometer server product.Internet of Thingsgroup operating margin was 25.1% as compared with 21.3% in the year-ago quarter and 27.7% in the previous quarter.Intel Security groupoperating margin expanded 330 bps on a year-over-year basis but declined 270 bps sequentially to 18.7%.Non-Volatile memory solutions groupreported loss of $91 million as compared with profit of $24 million in the year-ago quarter primarily attributed to start-up cost for China factory and costs associated with 3D XPoint.However,Programmable solutions groupreported profit of $80 million in the quarter.Balance SheetCash, marketable securities and fixed income trading asset balance at quarter end was almost $17.10 billion, down $670 million during the quarter.Intel has $20.65 billion in long-term debt now as well as $4.63 billion in short-term debt, which has led to a net debt balance of $8.18 billion.Intel paid dividends of $4.9 billion and used $2.6 billion to repurchase 81 million shares in 2016.GuidanceIntel guided first-quarter 2017 revenues of around $14.8 billion (+/-$500 million), almost flat sequentially. The non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be around 63% (+/-1%). R&D and MG&A expenses are anticipated to come in at around $5.3 billion.Operating income is projected to be approximately $4.1 billion, while earnings are anticipated to be 65 cents (+/- 5 cents) per share.For full-year 2017, management expects revenues to remain flat and gross margin of 63% (+/-2%). R&D and MG&A expenses are anticipated to come in at around $20.5 billion (+/- $400 million).Operating income is projected to be approximately $17.1 billion, while earnings are anticipated to be $2.80 per share.Full-year capex is now expected to be $12 billion (+/-$500 million) up $2.4 billion from 2016.Zacks RankCurrently, Intel carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Amgen, Inc. (AMGN) Stock Is a Bet on Fatter Yields;1/27/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAmgen Inc.(NASDAQ:AMGN), the largest of the so-called biotech stocks, is a very fat company with enormous margins and middling growth.makeArticleAd();Source:Richard Masoner via FlickrIt is the kind of company conservative brokers stick in a client's portfolio knowing it's safe. With a 3% yield, it's almost a bond. Over the last five years, its capital gains of 122% have exceeded those of the NASDAQ, up 99.3%, but not by an enormous amount.Writers like our James Brumleytalk breathlessly about Amgen's court cases concerning ""biosimilars,"" drugs that mimic the work of patented medicines but are made in a different way. But AMGN stock can win no matter how the courts rule.Whether you, as a self-directed investor, want a piece of Amgen depends on your goals. If you want growth, you may want to take a pass. If you want yield, you may want in.Eyes on the Amgen DividendAmgen is due to report its 2016 numbers on Feb. 2, and analysts are expecting the usual roughly 5% growth on both the top-line and bottom line. For the quarter, that means almost $2.1 billion in earnings,$2.78 per share, and revenues of $5.73 billion.The 7 Best High-Yield Investments for RetirementThis means Amgen is bringing over 30% of revenue to the net income line, with mid-single-digit growth. Operating margins are approaching 50%, and management has used that money to reduce debt slightly - about 41% of assets are under debt currently.What you should be looking at is the dividend, which looks ordinary at $1.15 per share, a current 3% yield, but has been growing like gangbusters since it was instituted in 2011 at about 28 cents. If you got in back in 2012, when the stock was at around $70, you're now getting a yield of 6.6%, a yield covered nearly three times by earnings. For a dividend investor, that's a home run.Knowing that AMGN stock management has been hiking the dividend steadily regardless of earnings fluctuations should give you confidence that today's slim yield could easily be tomorrow's fat one.The only question is whether the five-year pattern repeats.AMGN Stock's Patent StoryThis is where the patent story comes into play.Drug companies are all about patents, and Amgen is no different. If you have taken Enbrel for arthritis, or a relative has been given Neulasta to treat side effects of cancer chemotherapy, or your mother has taken Prolia to prevent bone fractures, you're a customer.But all patented medicines are threatened - or rather, their fat monopoly profits and margins are threatened - by biosimilars, drugs that mimic the action of patented medicines but are different enough to merit a separate patent.AMGN stock recently got a biosimilar fromRegeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc(NASDAQ:REGN)pulled from the market, but it is also in court fighting for a biosimilar to Humira fromAbbvie Inc(NASDAQ:ABBV). As Brumley notes, Amgen is also fighting a biosimilar to Neupogen fromNovartis AG (ADR)(NYSE:NVS).If courts rule for biosimilars, the margins on many drugs could be under long-term threat. If courts rule against them, the biosimilar pipelines of many companies, including Amgen, could also be under threat. But take the word threat here with a grain of salt. AMGN stock is playing both sides of the game, and will likely win either way.Should You Buy Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock? 3 Pros, 3 ConsThe bottom line thus remains the same. You buy Amgen if you believe the dividend can keep growing, making today's yield fatter tomorrow. You buy Amgen as part of a diversified portfolio, if you want safe exposure to the biotech field.Then, once you buy it, ignore analyses like this one. Just put it away and leave it alone for five years. You should do OK.Dana Blankenhornis a financial and technology journalist.

International Business Machines Corp. Is Back! (IBM);1/27/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWorking forInternational Business Machines Corp.(IBM) was the dream of many students in my business school. A job with the world's leading high-tech company was far and away the most popular goal of both the graduate and undergraduate students.makeArticleAd();The talk was always very positive about the disciplined environment, the uniform of a dark suit, crisp white shirt, sober looking tie, the respect from others, and of course the relatively high pay for their sales representatives. When this company would visit the campus for career day interviews, it was insane. Everyone jockeyed to look their best and get an interview.Perhaps best known for their work in the very early days of the personal computer, ""Big Blue"" is sometimes credited with its invention, a disputed fact. But one thing is for sure: they certainly popularized the PC.The world changed on August 12, 1981; the company announced the personal computer with the unheard-of price tag of $1,565. Just twenty years earlier, machines with similar capabilities could cost millions of dollars, demanded an entire office building floor, and required a large staff to maintain.This initial mass-produced PC was powered by an Intel 8088 microprocessor running at speeds measured in millionths of a second. It was the size of a portable typewriter and contained 40K of read-only memory and 16K of user memory, as well as a built-in speaker for creating sounds. Its five expansion slots could be used to connect such features as expanded memory, display and printing units, and game ""paddles.""Although this $158 billion market-cap bruiser remains one the Dow's 30 stocks, it is no longer known as an innovator. In fact, many investors consider IBM to be a washed-up giant, worthwhile only for to its 3%-plus dividend and index credentials.But that's all about to change. IBM is repositioning itself on the cutting-edge, with plans to have five life-changing innovations released within the next five years.The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for 2017: The Experts' PicksInternally called 5 in 5, this initiative will not only change our lives, but it may also supercharge the share price over the same time frame.Innovation 1: Making The Invisible VisibleIBM plans to make the invisible visible by focusing artificial intelligence on cognitive health. The goal is to analyze physical signals such as speech patterns to reveal neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's. This will enable medical professionals to take pre-emptive measures to help treat diseases before the more easily observable visible symptoms arise.Innovation 2: Superhero VisionThe company is also using AI to create hyper-powerful imaging devices. Just like the comic book heroes, the technology will help humans see widely beyond the domain of visible light by combining multiple bands of the electromagnetic spectrum. Most interestingly from the investor and consumer point of view, these devices will be portable, affordable, and accessible to everyone.Innovation 3: The MacroscopeIBM's Macroscrope project will organize and quantify vast and complex data gathered by billions of devices within the range of our vision and understanding. It is a system of software and algorithms to bring all of Earth's complex data together.Simply stated, this tool or system will digitize the physical world by gathering trillions of data points produced by the internet of things. IBM states that there are already more than six billion connected devices generating tens of exabytes (billion gigabytes) of data per month, with a growth rate of more than 30% per year.Innovation 4: Medical Lab On A ChipThis device, like Star Trek's medical tricorder, would be a portable and capable of diagnosing any disease. However, IBM's goal is to shrink the system down to a single silicon chip that would contain all of the processes necessary to analyze an illness that would today require a full-scale biochemistry lab. IBM scientists are developing lab-on-a-chip nanotechnology that can separate and isolate bioparticles down to 20 nanometers in diameter, a scale that gives access to DNA, viruses, and exosomes.Innovation 5: Real-Time Pollution DetectionImagine being able to instantly know that there is a leak in a pipeline or energy plant. IBM is developing affordable sensing technologies that can be deployed near natural gas extraction wells, around storage facilities, and along distribution pipelines will enable the industry to pinpoint invisible leaks in real time. This technology has the potential to work wonders in helping to save the environment.Should You Buy Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock? 3 Pros, 3 ConsRisks To Consider:IBM has high goals and the resources to reach them. However, it remains speculative what objectives will be achieved and in what time frame. Investors need to understand that every stock market investment has risk no matter how seductive it appears.Action To Take:Enter long under $180.00 per share with an upside target of $220.00. Initial stops are suggested at $162.50 per share.Editor's Note:America'smost successful tech investorsare getting ready to make MILLIONS off 2017's virtual reality breakthroughs.But they're not investing in what you think…StreetAuthority's mission is to help individual investors earn above-average profits by providing a source of independent, unbiased - and most of all, profitable - investing ideas.

Alphabet (GOOGL) Misses on Q4 Earnings, Beats Revenues;1/27/2017;"AlphabetGOOGLfourth-quarter earnings of $7.56 missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.65 due to higher taxes. However, earnings were up 7.1% year over year.Following weaker-than-expected earnings, shares were down more than 2% in after-hours trading. Higher cost of revenue and steeper taxes impacted the quarter's earnings.Coming to the price performance, over the past one year, shares of Alphabet have been steadily treading higher. The stock returned 19.43% compared with the Zacks categorizedInternet Servicesindustry's gain of 19.39%.On the Other Bets side, most of the businesses included in it are in their early stages. However, it is gradually picking up. Management said that Nest, Fiber and Verily were revenue contributors in the fourth quarter.The main drivers of the Google business haven't changed. Pricing remains under pressure both on account of the ongoing FX concerns as well as continued strength in mobile and TrueView. Volumes are however encouraging as total paid click growth of 36% remains a reassuring number.Google continues to enjoy strength on the mobile platform. One of the drivers is Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP). This is being accepted by many publishers and sites around the world covering more than 700,000 domains. Management is focused on driving mobile experiences and the company is well positioned to pick up strong intent-to-buy signals as a result of studying mobile searches from its huge data base. As a result, direct response marketers remain interested in it.Google also mentioned messaging as an important addition to its product line in the form of Allo (mobile messaging) and Duo (video messaging) to further drive user experience. Also, the company said that Google Cloud is generating substantial revenue growth, reflecting the ongoing momentum in the business.The company has greater control on the browser through Android as well as distribution agreements with Apple (AAPL). But the upcoming threats shouldn't be ignored. Apple may not renew its agreement, MicrosoftMSFTWindows 10 could steal overall search market share, FacebookFBgraph search and the social network itself could take away advertising dollars, and AmazonAMZNalready takes care of most product searches.Management said that YouTube remains a strong contributor benefiting from the increase in online video consumption. More than a thousand creators are currently engaged with the platform, bringing in a thousand subscribers everyday.And finally, Google platforms like Android, Chrome and Daydream continue to help it draw more users and sell more ads.The Numbers in DetailRevenuesGross total revenue of $26.06 billion grew 16.1% sequentially and 22.2% year over year (up 24% in constant currency or CC). The increase was primarily driven by the strength in Mobile Search, with the ongoing strength in YouTube. Also, strength in newer investment areas and solid progress in Other Bets aided revenue growth.The geographic distribution was as follows: the U.S. generated around 49% of revenues, up 19.8% sequentially. The U.K., with an 8% revenue share was up 10.5% sequentially. Other international markets accounted for the balance, representing sequential increase of 14.1%.Google SegmentThe segment includes search, advertising, Play, hardware and Cloud & Apps.Coming to the search business, on a sequential basis, revenues from Google-owned sites grew 11.7%, while that from partner sites increased 18.7% resulting in a total advertising revenue growth of 13.0%.Google-owned sitesand partner sites grew 20.3% and 7.0%, respectively, year over year and brought in 69% and 17% of quarterly revenues.Management said that mobile search continued to benefit from improvements in ad formats and delivery initiated in the third quarter of 2015 as well as remained optimistic about search revenue growth on both tablets and desktops. TrueView and DoubleClick Bid Manager were the primary drivers of YouTube revenue although app promotions are becoming bigger contributors.The traditional AdSense benefited from strength in programmatic and AdMob, offset by a decline in the traditional network business.Other revenue was up 39.9% sequentially and 62.0% year over year to just over 13% of fourth quarter revenue. The strength was on account of Play Store sales (apps, content) and cloud revenues.Other Bets SegmentAlphabet broke out the segment for the first time in the March quarter of2016. The segment includes Fiber, Verily, Calico, Nest and incubation activities in X Labs. Revenues were up 33.0% sequentially and 74.7% year over year.Since this segment is a combination of several businesses that are in the pre-revenue stage, operating different models and serving diverse end markets, the results are likely to be lumpy in any given quarter.Total traffic acquisition cost, or TAC(the portion of revenue shared with Google's partners and amounts paid to distribution partners and others who direct traffic to the Google website) was up 15.9% sequentially and 19.6% year over year.TAC paid out to network partners were up 17.5% sequentially and 7.6% year over year. Mobile search carries higher TAC so the increase in mobile search revenue is driving related TAC according to management.TAC for distribution arrangements was up 13.3% sequentially and 48.3% year over year.Net advertising revenue, excluding TAC was up 12.2% sequentially and 16.8% year over year.Revenue net of TAC came in at $21.22 billion, up 16.1% sequentially and 22.8% year over year. The top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $20.58 billion.MarginsGross margin of 59.1% shrank 216 bps sequentially and 251 bps from the year-ago quarter.Price declines remained negative in both sequential and year-over-year comparisons as the mix continued to move toward lower-margin business.Cost per click (CPC) was down a respective 9% and 15% from the previous and year-ago quarters. On a sequential basis, CPC was down 11% on Google sites but remained flat on network sites. On Google sites, CPCs were down 16% from the year-ago quarter, while network CPC declined 19%.Paid clicks grew 20% sequentially and 36% year over year, helped in part by growing volumes of mobile and TrueView ads on YouTube. Google sites did better than Network sites with paid clicks growing 23% and 43%, respectively, from the previous and year-ago quarters. Network paid clicks also increased 6% sequentially and 7% from the year-ago quarter.Operating expenses of $8.76 billion increased 9.8% sequentially and 12.9% from the December quarter of 2015. The operating margin was 25.5%, down 22 bps sequentially but up 425 bps from the year-ago quarter.Non-operating gains were $218 million compared with $278 million in the previous quarter and ($180) million in the Dec 2015 quarter.Alphabet reported net income of $5.33 billion, or 20.5% of sales, compared with $5.06 billion, or 22.5% of sales in the Sep 2016 quarter and $4.92 billion, or 23.1% of sales in the year-ago quarter. GAAP earnings of $7.56 a share were up from $7.25 in the previous quarter and $7.06 in the year-ago quarter.Balance SheetAlphabet has a solid balance sheet, with cash and short-term investments of around $86.33 billion, up $3.27 billion from the third quarter. The company generated around $9.41 billion of cash from operations in the fourth quarter and spent $3.08 billion on capex, netting a free cash flow of $6.34 billion.Alphabet also spent $662 million on acquisitions and $13 million to repay some debt.Alphabet Inc.

Why a Toy Maker and a Coffee Company are Pushing Virtual Assistants;1/26/2017;"By now we have all seen demonstrations of the practicality of   thevirtual personal assistant. The biggest tech companies have made daily requests like   directions, internet searches, and local restaurants commonplace,   but companies likeMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) aren't the only ones playing in the virtual   assistant space -- plenty of other smaller players are   incorporating the tech into their existing offerings to keep with   the times and avoid being left behind.Virtual assistants at a tipping point.  Image source:   Pixabay.makeArticleAd();Aristotle virtual assistant for children. Image source:     Mattel.Virtual babysitter?Not to be outdone by big tech,Mattel(NASDAQ: MAT) is creating a device-based virtual assistant for an   entirely different demographic -- your kids.  Its entry,   Aristotle, is a multi-function smart speaker designed to grow   with children. It works as a baby monitor in their early years,   with live streaming encrypted video to your phone. It can also be   programmed to soothe a crying baby with soft lighting or music,   help parents monitor feedings and diaper changes, and remind   users to order diapers when they get low. The distinguishing   feature of Aristotle is the use of voice recognition, which gives   it the ability to understand children's voices from the age of a   toddler. It will read stories, answer child-like questions, and   be a digital friend. It is designed not to be static, but to grow   with kids, like helping older children with homework.    Aristotle incorporates Bing search and Cortana technology   courtesy of Microsoft. It also boasts 256-bit encryption in all   communications, with a focus on protecting the privacy of its   users.Traditional toy makers have been battling a powerful trend as   children gravitate to more digital forms of play. They have been   trying to remake themselves in an attempt to remain relevant   going forward amid the changing landscape. Mattel's entry into   the virtual assistant category is a brilliant move in trying to   capture the hearts and minds of children as they grow.Virtual photo editorImage source: Pixabay.Adobe(NASDAQ: ADBE) is another company you may not expect in the   category. It is considering the introduction of a virtual   assistant that can handle simple photo editing. In aconcept videoreleased on YouTube, it demonstrates a man using voice commands   to crop a photo, flip the aspect, reverse it, and finally post it   on Facebook.  The caption to the video reads, ""Our Adobe   Research team is exploring what an intelligent digital assistant   photo editing might look like. With Adobe Sensei we combined the   emerging science of voice interaction with a deep understanding   of both creative workflows and the creative aspirations of our   customers.""  While it appears to still be in the concept or   potentially development stage, it provides insight into potential   future uses.Image source: Starbucks.Virtual baristaDuring its investor day in December,Starbucks(NASDAQ: SBUX) revealed that it too will introduce a virtual   assistant, My Starbucks Barista, to its mobile app later this   year. Users will be able to place orders by talking into their   cellphone. It will recognize complicated drink orders and confirm   orders via text message.  This isn't the first time   Starbucks has used emerging artificial intelligence (AI)   technology to better connect with its customers. Its   gold-standard rewards program uses AI to personalize over 400,000   different rewards per week. These rewards are tailored to each   user based on order history.The takeawaySmartphone virtual personal assistants are becoming   commonplace, but the technology is still in its infancy.

Revenue productivity jumped more than 10% in the quarter, partly on excellent growth in its Azure unit, which was up 93%. Microsoft will provide guidance in its upcoming conference call.Intel beat on both top and bottom lines late Thursday, reporting 79 cents per share -- representing a 4-cent beat -- on $16.37 billion in revenues, better than the $15.76 billion in the Zacks consensus estimate. Gross margins came in-line and guidance for Q1 rose a bit higher.

The number of transactions in the quarter was also higher than expected, while volumes were actually $2 billion below. Guidance seems to be growing more conservative as well, which has led to the after-market sell-off.Click here for Zacks Director or Research Sheraz Mian's   latest Earnings Trends Report:3 Takeaways from Q4 Earnings SeasonWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Whiffs on Earnings, But Here’s the Bright Side;1/26/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe world's biggest and most recognizable all-things-internet nameAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) reported its fourth-quarter numbers after the bell, and they fell unusually short of estimates.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockFor the quarter ending in December, the company formerly known as Googleearned $9.36per shareversus expectations of $9.63.Alphabet's top line of $26.06 billion compares favorably to analyst predictions for revenue of $25.22 billion. The company reported a profit of $8.67 per share of GOOGL stock in the same quarter from a year earlier, when it drove sales of $21.33 billion.The numbers interrupt a long-term streak of forward, even if not perfect, fiscal progress. Alphabet has topped estimates in five of the past seven quarters.CFO Ruth Porat commented on the Alphabet earnings report:""Our growth in the fourth quarter was exceptional - with revenues up 22% year on year and 24% on a constant currency basis. This performance was led by mobile search and YouTube. We're seeing great momentum in Google's newer investment areas and ongoing strong progress in Other Bets.""GOOGL shares were 2.1% lower in after-hours trading.New Focus on Hardware Going WellAlphabet, while it was still called Google, was founded primarily as a web search engine, and that's still the lion's share of its revenue mix. Though aggregate cost-per-click fell, continuing a long (and industry-wide) trend of deterioration, with another 9% year-over-year decline, that dip continues to be more than offset by a sheer increase of volume.7 Stocks to Buy That Could Double by 2018Aggregate paid clicks grew 20% on a year-over-year basis. Google - the search engine and its ancillary products and services - contributed $25.8 billion worth of last quarter's revenue, and was responsible for $7.88 billion of the $8.5 billion in Alphabet's operating income.Although search and ads are still its bread-and-butter business, the company has recently begun the development of hardware and Internet of Things devices. The highest-profile of these new initiatives is the so-called Pixel phone. Although the company had brought smartphones to the market in the past - like the Nexus - those were mostly third-party/branded handsets. The Pixel is a true, home-grown,in-house smartphonefrom Google that's designed to take aim at the popular iPhone line fromApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL).Bloomberg recently reported thatAlphabet sold an estimated 1 million Pixels last quarter; the company doesn't provide such details. That doesn't even come close to the45.5 million iPhones Apple sold last quarter, but it's a very good first effort.The Pixel is just one way Alphabet has remained relevant as consumers continue to migrate from desktops to mobile devices. Its Android operating system isnow the OS of choiceon nearly 90% of all handheld devices sold, funneling users to Google's apps, services and revenue-bearing display ads.Digital Is Still ImportantAnd the company is getting serious about squeezing more revenue out of its Google Play store. Going forward,Chromebooks will run all Android apps, making Chromebooks as well as more of its apps more marketable. The move poses a threat to the current king of laptop/notebook operating systemsMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT).YouTube was another bright spot for Alphabet during its fourth fiscal quarter.Although garnering traffic has never been a problem for the online-video venue (the site attracts more than 30 million viewers per day, who collectively watch nearly 5 billion clips every day), optimizing the ad revenue YouTube generates has proven difficult. The organization seems to have finally found a winning formula though.Again, Alphabet doesn't provide such specifics, but RBC Capital analyst Mark Mahaney estimated thatYouTube generates $10 billion in annual ad revenue, or roughly a tenth of the company's total revenue. Porat also made a point of saying Mobile Search and YouTube led the company's revenue growth for the quarter.Looking Ahead for GOOGL StockJust within the past few days, two experts have chimed in with bullish expectations for GOOGL shares. Specifically, Pacific Crestbegan coverage of Alphabet last week with a price target of $1,030, and this week,Barron'sopinedGOOGL shares could reach $1,000before the end of 2017. Those targets are approximately 20% higher than where the stock closed on Thursday.Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Q2 Earnings: They're Good ... But Not GreatAnalysts expect Alphabet to earn $41.07 per share this year, on $104.07 billion in revenue. Those figures are 19% and 16% higher, respectively, than 2016's tally. Nothing about last quarter's numbers suggests the company won't reach those targets.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace5 Blue-Chip Stocks to Sell in February10 High-Yield Dividend Stocks That Are SOMEHOW Still BargainsThe postAlphabet Inc (GOOGL) Whiffs on Earnings, But Here's the Bright Sideappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Alphabet (GOOGL) Earnings: Fourth Quarter Revenue Soars 22%;1/26/2017;"Google earnings (Shutterstock photo)Google parent Alphabet (GOOG) reported another strong set of financial results Thursday, beating Wall Street’s fourth quarter revenue estimates, which grew 22% year over year, thanks to the company’s continued dominance in advertising.Over the past couple of quarters, the Mountain View, Calif.-based tech giant has been working to offset declining mobile advertising value with higher clicks. The rate of revenue and earnings growth suggests that this strategy continues to pay off.makeArticleAd();In the three months that ended December, Alphabet reported a net income rose to $5.33 billion, or $7.56 per, up from $4.92 billion, or $7.06 per share, a year earlier. On an adjusted basis, when taking out one-time gains and costs, earnings were $9.36 per share, which misses estimates of $9.64 per share. Fourth quarter revenue rose 22% to $26.06 billion, easily topping Street forecast of $25.23 billion.“Our growth in the fourth quarter was exceptional -- with revenues up 22% year on year and 24% on a constant currency basis. This performance was led by mobile search and YouTube,” said CFO Ruth Porat in a statement. “We’re seeing great momentum in Google’s newer investment areas and ongoing strong progress in Other Bets.”Indeed, advertising revenue — up 17% to $19 billion — remains the company’s bread-and-butter business, accounting for some 90% of revenue. Google has, however, begun to show strength is its “Other Bets” — a segment that includes autonomous vehicles, virtual/augment reality headsets, its cloud business and, more recently, its smartphones. Revenue in that group came in at $262 million, surging 75% year over year from $150 million a year ago.Google’s cost-per-click, a key metric determining the value of an ad, fell 11% year-over-year this quarter. But aggregate paid clicks increased 20%, showing that the management continue to find ways to offset the decline. As have been the case for some time, the primary growth driver continues to be the strength in search and YouTube. Notably, Google Cloud, which hopes to compete with Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT), has begun to show meaningful revenue growth.Google websites revenue rose 20% to $17.9 billion, while Google Network revenues increase 7% to $4.4 billion. As with the strong showing the third quarter, paid clicks on Google websites were up 43% year over year. Alphabet did not provide a forecast, but the consensus first-quarter 2017 estimates call for EPS of $9.34 on revenues of $23.74 billion. For the full year analysts forecast EPS of $41.07 on revenues of $104.07 billion.Alphabet stock traded lower on the report, down by about 2.5% at $834 in after-hours trading. I see this as a solid buying opportunity. With some patience, GOOGL stock should reach $1,050 in 2017, delivering 23% returns."

Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Q2 Earnings: They’re Good … Just Not Great;1/26/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) just pulled off a pretty good fiscal second quarter. The cloud continued to provide a lift for the company, which also saw a positive impact from itsLinkedInacquisition. But it appears Wall Street had already factored much of this in, as MSFT stock was up just less than 1% in Thursday's after-hours trading.makeArticleAd();Source:Via MicrosoftShares may have been due for a breather, though. Since late June, Microsoft stock is up by about 33%.For the quarter, earnings grew by 3.6% year-over-year to 79 cents a share and revenues improved 2.2% to reach $25.3 billion. That's good for a small beat on the top line, and an analyst match on the bottom line.Here are some of the highlights of the Microsoft earnings report:The company returned $6.5 billion in buybacks and dividends.Revenues in the Productivity and Business Processes rose 10% to $7.4 billion.Revenues for the Office consumer products and cloud services jumped 22%There are no 24.9 million Office 365 consumer subscribers.Revenues for the cloud-based Azure business soared 93%.This story has been updated.Microsoft Stock and The Cloud OpportunityOver the past few years, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has been doubling down on the cloud market, where there's plenty of room for growth. According to Gartner, total global spending is forecast to increase from $204 billion in 2016 to $318 billion by 2019.7 Stocks to Buy That Could Double by 2018The irony is that the main rival for MSFT isAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN), which currently dominates the cloud market.SAP SE (ADR)(NYSE:SAP),International Business Machines Corp.(NYSE:IBM) andOracle Corporation(NYSE:ORCL) have been notable laggards, but they're ramping up their efforts.For holders of Microsoft stock, it is important to note that the success with the cloud has not been just about being early to the game. MSFT has some some incredible advantages, such as a trusted brand, years' of experience with mission-critical systems and a global infrastructure.What's more, Microsoft has been smart and aggressive about acquisitions. LinkedIn - which provided MSFT with a massive professional network and even core next-gen cloud strategies - ia a clear case for this. There also should be nice synergies for integrations with the Office franchise, Skype and Yammer.Also encouraging is Microsoft's progress in revamping its old-line products, then moving them toward the cloud. Just look at Dynamics, a customer relationship management (CRM) product. Dynamics revenues increased 7% year-over-year in the latest quarter, primarily driven by the cloud version. This could be a sign that MSFT is gaining ground on the giant in the space,Salesforce.com, Inc.(NYSE:CRM).Bottom Line on MSFT StockYes, Microsoft does have issues, such as the PC side of the business, which continues to lag. In Q2, revenues here dropped 5% to $11.8 billion. But a big part of this was an expected drop in phone revenues; once you dig into the numbers, you'll see a 5% increase in Windows OEM products.Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Whiffs on Earnings, But Here's the Bright SideGoing forward, MSFT stock could get a nice lift from the expected tax changes from the Trump administration as well. A tax repatriation would allow the company to bring back more than $113 billion from offshore accounts. That would allow for more acquisitions, stock buybacks and maybe a special dividend.All of that would be key in keeping shares in bull mode.Tom Taulli runs the InvestorPlace blogIPO Playbookand is a registered investment adviser representative (you canvisit his siteto learn more about his financial planning services).He is also the author of various books on investing like All About Commodities, All About Short Selling and High-Profit IPO Strategies.Follow him on Twitter at@ttaulli.

By comparison,Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) is up nearly 25% in the last year whileNokia Corp (ADR)(NYSE:NOK), which exited the Windows Phone market and focused on networking, fell 33%.Still, the DTEK70 release is important for BBRY.BlackBerry and TCL PartnershipBlackBerry outsourced its entire hardware development and manufacturing withTCL. Early signs are positive that ""Mercury"" will win customers, especially in the business space. BlackBerry said that it is 100% indevelopingsoftware solutions. TCL's ""Mercury"" build offers a secure Android operating system and has a physical keyboard. The company earns IP and royalty revenue for each device TCL sells.On its conference call in December, BlackBerrydescribedthe TCL deal:This licensing model allows BlackBerry to generate ongoing high margin royalty revenue from a device software based on the number of units sold. We have a pipeline of additional opportunities that are focusing on, including a late discussion in India that are ongoing.""Decent Price to PerformanceBlackBerry priced the budget DTEK50 in the right range but did not win the mainstream market.

At that price and size, business users who crave for higher productivity will snap up this phone when it is launched.Profit MarginBlackBerry CEO John Chen will not allow the company to sell devices at a loss. Assume profit margins in the range of 25%-50% for TCL. When the costs of software development are included, the profit margin for BBRY may run above 50%-60%.Launch DateOn its blog, BlackBerry said it will give more details about the smartphone at the Mobile World Congress show.

In the third quarter, the $172 million in software services revenue accounted for 57% of the company's revenue.The TCL licensing deal, though, is a game-changer for the software company. DTEK70's development costs are all shouldered by its partner. BlackBerry gets a cut in the sales through the software licensing. High profit margins from software sales will translate to more profits for the company.The one big catch is that BBRY and TCL must advertise and promote this upcoming device. BlackBerry made $12 million in operating income in the third quarter.Profit Model for DTEK 70Assuming TCL pays a 10% royalty on the profits of the $350 device, or $20 per device, BlackBerry could earn the following:Units Sold per quarterProfit100,000  $   2,000,000250,000$ 5,000,000 500,000  $ 10,000,000Selling 500,000 units a quarter would match the company's third-quarter operating income.3 Reasons to Buy Ford Motor Company (F) Stock on This DipBottom Line on BBRY StockThe smartphone market is still wide-open for small players like BlackBerry.

Should You Buy Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock? 3 Pros, 3 Cons;1/26/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIf you bought and held stock inMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) at the height of the dot-com run, it's been an unpleasant 16 years. However, after a long wait, MSFT stock finally reached a new all-time high last month. Despite the tech world changing drastically in the ensuing years, Microsoft's PC dominance lives on, minting money for the company.makeArticleAd();Source:Mike Mozart Via FlickrThe company's various new efforts over the years have mostly been flops. There's a reason Microsoft stock has performed poorly; efforts such as Windows phones simply haven't panned out. However, it seems Microsoft has finally turned the corner.It is making real headway in several promising areas, including its cloud offering. And investors have cheered, sending Microsoft's stock up sharply since 2013. Can the good times continue, or will buyers up at these levels be in for another long decade?MSFT Stock ConsHuge Stock Run-Up: Since 2013, MSFT stock has more than doubled. At first glance, that seems fine, the market has performed strongly in recent years after all. However, Microsoft is so large, that it becomes hard to achieve further such doublings. With a market cap just under $500 billion today, even one more double takes Microsoft to a trillion dollar market cap. It's worth asking what the company has going from a growth perspective that could justify such a lofty figure.Sure, the company has some growth initiatives under way. The cloud offering is going well. And the LinkedIn acquisition may start to bear more fruit. But after watching the stock run from under 30 in recent years to over 60 today, you have to ask how much more upside really makes sense, particularly since the company has had near non-existent revenue growth lately.10 High-Yield Dividend Stocks That Are SOMEHOW Still BargainsHigh Valuation:First things first, MSFT stock isn't really trading at a 30 price-earnings ratio. I know that's what financial websites report. However, that's based on GAAP figures that include one-off losses related to restructuring. On an adjusted basis, Microsoft is trading in the mid-20s, and at 21 times forward earnings. However, even that doesn't paint a flattering picture for the company. Microsoft traded at 12 times earnings or less over much of the past decade. Is Microsoft worth paying twice as much for now?Sure, the PC market has stabilized, but it isn't likely to ever be a meaningful growth driver again. And the newer initiatives such as cloud seem likely to take years to reach strong profitability. At 21 times forward earnings, MSFT stock is pricing in some serious growth prospects that may well not materialize.Questionable Deal-Making:Microsoft has a reputation for making some head-scratching M&A moves. The less said of the aQuantive purchase and the Nokia buy, the better. Those two alone resulted in almost $14 billion of write-offs. And the recent LinkedIn deal raises questions. Microsoft paid $26 billion for LinkedIn, and offered a massive premium to where shares where trading previously. At the price Microsoft paid, it offered around 30x free cash flow for LinkedIn. On an earnings basis, LinkedIn was still losing money.Sure, Microsoft can cut some costs there, particularly for stock-based compensation, but it's still a massive price tag. And with Microsoft having such a huge war chest on its balance sheet, the temptation will surely be there for the company to make other huge value-destructive deals.MSFT Stock ProsPC Market Stabilizing:For quite a few years now, the traditional PC market appeared to be in serious decline. Sales peaked in 2011, with364 million unitssold that year globally. Since then, sales have plunged. By 2015, sales dropped 24% from that peak year, falling to just 275 million units. And 2016 showed another solid decline, with sales reaching just 260 million units. However, the worst may now have passed. 2020 projections are for 250 million units sold, only a fractional decline from current levels.And themost recent datasupports this further moderation: sales slipped just 1.5% versus the same period last year. And in several areas globally, including Canada and Japan, PC sales are actually increasing again. One possible reason, the rate of forward technological progress has slowed for both tablets and smartphones, reducing pressure on consumers to switch to smaller screens. A stable market would be great news for MSFT stock.Partnership With Qualcomm:Microsoft has partnered withQualcomm, Inc.(NASDAQ:QCOM) for their Internet of Things efforts. Qualcomm has entered conflict withIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) at first over the IoT market. In the longer-run, Qualcomm may use its chips to even forcefully attack Intel's long-held dominance in the PC market. In any case, Microsoft benefits nicely from partnering up with Qualcomm.The IoT offerings born from this venture will help spread Windows 10 outside of just the traditional PC market. And given the shellacking that QCOM stock took earlier this week followingApple Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AAPL) lawsuit against the firm, Qualcomm has reason to deepen ties with friendly partners. As an industry outcast, Qualcomm needs whatever help it can get, and if Microsoft can use that to expand Windows as a broader OS, all the better.Solid Dividend Option:Microsoft has quietly turned into a nice yield choice for more conservative investors. The company has tripled its dividend since 2008. In total, it's posted 16%, 18% and 16% dividend growth rates over the past three, five and ten years. While the payout ratio currently looks a little high, that's based on abnormally soft recent earnings. Make no mistake, there is plenty of room left here for more dividend increases. The company has an astounding $137 billion in cash on its balance sheet. Even after subtracting out debt, the company has a net cash position of $62 billion, leaving plenty of firepower for increased dividends, share buybacks or acquisitions.VerdictMSFT stock is a decent selection if you're purely concerned with its yield and safety. The company's main PC business is looking healthier than it has in quite awhile. The balance sheet is tremendous. The dividend is significant at today's level, and is bound to keep rising quickly.Here's Why Chevron Corporation (CVX) Stock Is the Best Play in OilHowever, there's little to recommend Microsoft on valuation. The stock is expensive, even when you look closely. Microsoft has plenty of growth initiatives in the works, but actual operating results recently have only been so-so. When buying stocks at all-time highs, you want to see a business with more operating momentum.At the time of this writing, Ian Bezek held INTC and QCOM stock. He had no position in Microsoft.

Play Smart in the Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock Pullback;1/26/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsA relatively dismal start to 2017 forAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMD) received a bit more negative feedback Wednesday. But before anyone cries out ""Bear Market!"" let's examine AMD stock both off and on the price chart for clues about why, as well as check the options market for a suitable strategy.makeArticleAd();Source:Matthew Rutledge via Flickr2016 wasthe best of times for AMD stockand for good reason. Investors cheered a massive turnaround in the chipmaker's business attributed to strong execution, design wins withMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) andSony Corp (ADR)(NYSE:SNE) and even a return to non-GAAP profitability after flirting with bankruptcy not so long ago.The strong reboot didn't go unnoticed on AMD stock either.Investors witnessed a massive bullish reversal from a January 2016 low of $1.75 to a high of $12.42 by late December. AMD's near-300% gain in 2016 also put the outfit atop the semiconductor group in share price performance.But 2017 hasn't been as kind out of the gate. Nearly one month in and with theNasdaq 100up over 5%, AMD stock has shed roughly 7%. What's behind the about-face and relative weakness?5 Blue-Chip Stocks to Sell in FebruarySome investors could rightfully be looking ahead and concerned that while good progress has been made in Advanced Micro's fortunes, more is required and 2017 could prove pivotal.From the introduction of next-generation, high-end graphics and computing chips to the need to increase market share across key business segments and continuing to build on its bottom-line and cash-flow, there are clear challenges facing Advanced Micro Devices this year.If AMD falters or altogether fails to execute, shares are likely to be targeted by bears. But first things first. Under the leadership of CEO Lisa Su, who took over the role in 2014, AMD has been rising to the occasion withconcentrated betsand surpassing most analyst expectations.And withanalyst sentiment still somewhat coolon Advanced Micro Devices' prospects and AMD stock affording a lower-risk entry, a bit of optimism on the price chart and margin of safety afforded from a hedged AMD position could be well-served.AMD Stock Daily ChartAs mentioned, shares of AMD are off by about 9% year-to-date. From December's high the past month though, corrective activity has resulted in a run-of-the-mill but nice-sized dip of 24% in shares at the recent low of $9.42.Pullbacks like AMD's are common after a substantial price run. In fact, declines of up to 30% are considered quite normal if for no other reason than ordinary profit-taking, which quite honestly doesn't require a bearish shift in the narrative.And technically, with AMD shares having tested 2010's pivot high and the 50-day simple moving average, there are a couple more reasons to embrace, rather than fear, today's and this year's weakness in AMD stock.AMD Stock CollarReviewing AMD stock's options and with shares trading at $10.29 Wednesday evening, the March $12 call/$9 put collar is attractive.Priced for even money, the package price of $10.29, and equivalent to a naked long stock purchase, allows for guaranteed downside protection at $9 in AMD from the purchased put. The insurance policy of sorts is slightly below the recent technical low and a desirable level to protect the stock position for possible re-evaluation if required.As earnings in AMD stock are on tap next week, the collar's protection versus the more open-ended risk alternative, becomes even more attractive in our opinion. So, what's the catch?Bank of America Corp (BAC) Stock Is STILL Too Cheap to IgnoreThe real cost to this AMD position is the matching credit taken in to finance the long put. At the end of the day, the trader has sold a call at the $13 strike.However, as the initial cap on profits is set at 16.6% for slightly less than a two month holding period-there's no alternative facts to suggest this strategy is anything less than a great way to manage risk.Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in any of the securities or their derivatives mentioned in this article.

3 Covered Calls to Drop a $1,000 in Your Bank Account;1/26/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTo me, covered calls serve two really solid purposes when it comes to using this strategy in a long-term diversified portfolio, such as the one I'll be building in my upcoming stock advisory newsletter,The Liberty Portfolio.makeArticleAd();Source: ShutterstockCovered calls can be used as a hedge. Let's say the market may turn south, which it may do since it's 20% overvalued right now; if a stock you own is going to go down with it, but you still want it as part of the portfolio you own, sell covered calls against the stock.First, you earn a premium for selling the covered calls, which will partially offset any loss the stock might experience.5 Blue-Chip Stocks to Sell in FebruaryHowever, covered calls are also a relatively low-risk way of generating income. Yes, you risk losing upside if the stock is called away, but you can always repurchase it if you desire.$1,000 Covered Calls: Microsoft (MSFT)Source:Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified)Microsoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) tricked me several years ago into believing it had nowhere to go. I stopped paying attention - always a mistake - and it has since become a far different operation than it was under Bill Gates.Yet despite it being as solid a company as you'll find, MSFT stock tends to be rather volatile, and that leads to generous premiums when selling covered calls. Combining a safe company with volatility is a great strategy for covered calls.Usually, I aim to squeeze 1.5% to 2.5% out of selling covered calls, for something approaching a 30-day contract period. That means something like 24% annualized.Microsoft stock closed Wednesday at $63.68. There are numerous many choices for both strike price and expiration, but it's nice and simple to go for selling the 17 Feb $64 covered calls for $1.33. You earn a 2.1% return. Sell four of these for $532 total.By the way, if it is called away, you earn 32 cents in capital gains, or another 0.5%.$1,000 Covered Calls: Starbucks (SBUX)Source:Javier González Via FlickrIn a similar vein,Starbucks Corporation(NASDAQ:SBUX) offers both safety in the underlying stock and lots of volatility that contributes to even more generous premiums. SBUX is going to enter a new phase soon, as Howard Schultz concocts a new growth trajectory. In the meantime, SBUX remains a dominant global brand with a solid balance sheet.SBUX stock closed Wednesday at $58.70. Thanks to options now being available at 50-cent increments for so many stocks, you can sell the 17 Feb $59 covered calls for $1.15. That provides you with a 2% return, and it's actually for a contract period of only 23 days! That offers an annualized return of 32%.It isn't much, by the way, but if it is called away, add 30 cents in capital gains to the trade, or 0.5%.10 Stocks to Buy to Survive a ""Trumpsy-Turvy"" 2017Sell three of these for $345, bringing you total to $877.$1,000 Covered Calls: AT&T (T)Source: ShutterstockI'm not a fan ofAT&T Inc.(NYSE:T)as far as it being a long-term growth or value stock to hold. It's not in any kind of trouble, but I just don't see the compelling ROI here. I do, however, understand buying it as a dividend stock, since it pays a very reliable yield now at 4.7%.Regrettably, the ten-year chart shows T stock has literally gone nowhere, although you certainly managed some nice dividend payments during that period. So if want the proverbial ""safe"" income stock, T stock is a fine choice. It also happens to be a good choice for covered calls to generate income. Again, it's a safe stock. The premiums are not that generous, but you can earn something.It closed Wednesday at $41.39. The 17 Feb $41.50 covered calls are selling for 65 cents. Sell two of these to bring you to a total of $1,007.Lawrence Meyers is the CEO of PDL Capital, and manager of the forthcomingLiberty Portfolio stock newsletter.

Facebook Inc (FB) Hires Former Google Exec to Lead Oculus;1/26/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFacebook Inc's(NASDAQ:FB) virtual reality division Oculus has had a rough six months, but it looks as though the company is ready to to push VR in 2017 and turn things around. CEO Mark Zuckerberg took to Facebook last night to announce thatHugo Barra will be joining FB to lead VR efforts, including Oculus. If the name sounds familiar it should. Barra is very well known in the technology industry.makeArticleAd();Source: FacebookSo who is Hugo Barra? He was in the news just last week when it was revealed he was leaving Chinese consumer technology giantXiaomi.He was hired in 2013 to lead that company's efforts to polish its image in western markets and help push its products into the U.S. market. At the time Barra said he was returning to his Silicon Valley roots, but gave no details.What Does Hugo Barra Bring to FB?Prior to Xiaomi, he served asAlphabet Inc's(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google vice president of Android product management.In his announcement of Barra's hire, Zuckerberg wrote:""I'm excited that Hugo Barra is joining Facebook to lead all of our virtual reality efforts, including our Oculus team. Hugo's in China right now, so here we are together in VR. It seems fitting.I've known Hugo for a long time, starting when he helped develop the Android operating system, to the last few years he's worked at Xiaomi in Beijing bringing innovative devices to millions of people. Hugo shares my belief that virtual and augmented reality will be the next major computing platform.""FB's Oculus ChallengesWhen Facebook bought Oculus for $2 billion in 2014, the prospects for its new virtual reality division seemed limitless. But for the last six months, the division has been struggling.10 Stocks to Buy to Survive a ""Trumpsy-Turvy"" 2017Founder Palmer Luckey was bringing inbad press over his political views, complaints over the highprices for its Oculus Rift headsetand the new Touch Controllers continued, andSony Corp (ADR)(NYSE:SNE) unexpectedly began to gain traction with both consumers and game developers with its much more affordable Playstation VR. In December, Oculus CEO Brendan Iribe stepped down. Now, FB and Luckey aretied up in a lawsuitclaiming the Oculus founder stole trade secrets and violated copyrights in order to develop his Oculus Rift VR headset.On top of all this, the hype over virtual reality is beginning to fade. After being a major part of past Consumer Electronics shows, there was a feeling thatVR wasn't particularly compelling at CES 2017.In short, it's understandable why FB wants to kickstart Oculus. An industry veteran like Hugo Barra -someone who is experienced in leading a critical division in a technology giant and skilled at promotion - may well be the answer.Kickstarting OculusWhen Barra takes over at Oculus, there are a few immediate challenges to take on. The lawsuit will have to be dealt with, but FB lawyers will be able to manage most of that.The bigger issue in terms of getting consumers to buy into the Oculus rift is pricing. The Oculus Rift already has mindshare as the VR headset people think of. But where the Oculus Rift was once pretty much the only game in town, every major consumer technology company - exceptApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) - is offering virtual reality gear, and it's almost always cheaper.Apple Inc. New iPads Might Be Late to the Party (AAPL)That wouldn't be such a big deal if you were looking at $100 versus $75. But an Oculus Rift plus Touch Controllers goes for $798. Then you need a reasonably powerful PC (many computer owners would have to upgrade), which is at least another $1,000. In comparison, a complete Sony Playstation VR system (including the PS4) can be had for about $800. However, the Playstation VR headset is compatible with the original PS4 - which many gamers already own, so that brings their investment to just $500.Largely as a result of those cost differences, it'sestimated Sony will have sold over 745,000 Playstation VR systems in 2016, while projections are for the Oculus Rift to hit just 355,000.The hire of Hugo Barra sets the stage for FB to aggressively promote the technical superiority of its Oculus virtual reality technology over that used by competitors like Sony. It's also a good move in promoting developer relations in an effort to boost the Oculus' lead in compelling VR content. And if he can find some wiggle room to get Oculus Rift pricing down a bit, Barra stands a good chance of turning things around for Facebook's virtual reality division in 2017.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace3 Things Apple Inc.

Freeport-McMoRan Inc (FCX) Stock Will Keep Grinding Higher;1/26/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsShares of natural resources companyFreeport-McMoRan Inc(NYSE:FCX) fell after the company reported its latest earnings on Wednesday, Jan. 25. Through a multiweek lens, however, FCX stock remains well-positioned to push higher. Better still: The stock is offering well-defined areas of support, which you can use to define your own risk.makeArticleAd();As I discussed yesterday,materials stocks as a sector this weekhave been showing notable relative strength. Freeport-McMoRan also is a materials stock, so purely through sector analysis, FCX should continue to have wind at its back for the time being.At least until a major bearish reversal rears its ugly head.For the fourth quarter, Freeport reported net income of $292 million, or about 25 cents per share, which came in below analyst estimates. Still, FCX stock has shown great relative strength versus the broader stock market over the past 12 months.Barring a sudden change in winds, this looks to continue.FCX Stock ChartsTo show this more visually, I created the below ratio chart where I divided FCX stock by theS&P 500- as represented by theSPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust(NYSEARCA:SPY). Note that after years of relative weakness, FCX in early 2016 finally began to break out of this down-trending channel.Click to EnlargeAll else being equal, this change of trend looks set to continue. That is to say, FCX could see continued outperformance versus broader U.S. stocks.5 Blue-Chip Stocks to Sell in FebruaryOn the multiyear weekly chart, we see that FCX stock - from its 2011 highs down into its early 2016 lows - lost more than 90% of its value, which is reflective of the relative weakness of the stock over this period of time.Click to EnlargeAfter the stock in early 2016 marginally pierced below its lows from the year 2008, it began to rise from the ashes. Since then the stock has managed to push itself back above its 50-week (yellow) and 100-week (blue) simple moving averages. Upside momentum in this time frame, as represented by the MACD indicator at the bottom of the chart, is also curling higher.Barring a major outside shock the stock now looks to be gravitating toward the multiyear diagonal resistance line (purple-dotted line diagonal), which currently also matches up with the 200-week (red) moving average.On the daily chart, note that after FCX stock in early November 2016 broke above horizontal resistance around the $13.50 area, it retested this level upon a pullback in early January and promptly began to bounce.Click to EnlargeThis week, on Jan. 24 - ahead of its earnings report the next day - FCX stock gapped higher and broke past resistance and its November 2016 highs.Trade of the Day: Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB)Active investors and traders now could try to play Freeport-McMoRan higher upon a push above $17 for a move toward $18 as a next upside target, using the $15.80 area as a stop-loss area. Traders with somewhat lengthier time frames could look to remain long the stock or leg into initial long positions for a move toward the $20 area.Any major bearish reversal on a weekly closing basis must be respected as a potential stop-loss signal.Like what you see?

Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Q2 Earnings Preview;1/25/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) stock has had an impressive run over the past few years. Heading into Thursday's fiscal second quarter earnings report, MSFT stock is right near an all-time high, having increased about 150% over the past few years.Source:Via MicrosoftWhat's interesting about the gains for such a large stock - MSFT is the third-most valuable company on U.S. markets, behind onlyApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) andAlphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOGL) - is that they haven't been based on Microsoft earnings. Microsoft's EPS was $2.73 in fiscal 2012, and $2.79 in fiscal 2016.makeArticleAd();Rather, the multiple investors assign to MSFT stock has expanded. It has more than doubled, in fact.That multiple expansion has come from increasing confidence toward Microsoft'sfutureearnings potential, most notably in mobile and cloud. Where investors four to five years ago saw a fading giant whose earnings were likely to decline, Microsoft now looks like a sleeping giant. And investors clearly believe the company's self-described ""mobile first, cloud first"" strategy is going to push Microsoft earnings up - at some point.It's in that context that the market will analyze the Microsoft earnings report due on Thursday.Microsoft's Growth Isn't There…YetIt's always dangerous for an investor to believe that the numbers don't matter, but in the case of MSFT stock, the numbers really aren't the most important thing right now.10 Stocks to Buy to Survive a ""Trumpsy-Turvy""     2017Analyst consensus - informed in large part by Microsoft earnings guidance - doesn't predict a particularly impressive second quarter earnings report. The Street expects EPS to rise just a penny year-over-year, which given share repurchases, implies that Microsoft's total net profits actually will be lower in Q2 FY17 than they were ago.  Revenue is estimated to fall almost 2% year-over-year.Microsoft's guidance projects growth in its Productivity & Business and Intelligent Cloud segments, but a sharp decline in More Personal Computing.That shouldn't be surprising. Office 365 growth has helped business revenue, and the Azure platform continues to be a worthy, if still much smaller, competitor to Amazon Web Services in cloud. It's the potential for success in those products that has offset fears about continuing pressure on revenue from Windows, as PC sales decline and mobile usage increases.Indeed, the gain in MSFT stock from $27 to $63 has come mostly from the transition.The fears of Windows losses that led MSFT stock to be valued around 10x EPS in 2013 have turned to optimism toward growth in Azure, Office 365, Enterprise Mobility and other areas. That optimism has pushed the same stock to be valued at about 21x FY17 earnings.So it seems unlikely that investors will focus on the major headline numbers coming out of the Microsoft earnings report. A beat or miss of a penny or two on earnings likely isn't going to drive the market's reaction to the report - particularly if that weakness comes from Windows. Rather, the focus is going to be on the growing, smaller, businesses, most notably Azure.There's a reason Microsoft has steadily expanded its disclosure around Azure and cloud growth: That's where investor attention has been. And it seems likely that's where investor attention will stay coming out of the Q2 Microsoft earnings report.What to Watch For in Microsoft EarningsInvestors seem likely to have some patience with a modest miss in the Microsoft earnings report, as expectations remain relatively low. The company still is getting out from under its deal withNokia Corp (ADR)(NYSE:NOK), and layoffs this year should provide a boost to margins over the next few quarters. Wall Street in particular isn't expecting growth to pick up until fiscal 2018, where sales are projected to grow more than 6% against a rate under 2% in fiscal 2017.So what seems to be important in the Q2 Microsoft earnings report is whether the base of that growth is intact.While Azure is estimated to generate just 3% of total revenue,accordingto analyst firm MKM Partners, its growth rate certainly will be watched closely. After a 140% increase in Q2 FY16, and 116% last quarter, any slowdown seems likely to hurt the stock. But another 100%-plus figure would give further evidence that Azure is a worthy competitor to AWS, and support the current MSFT stock price.The cloud business as a whole - including Office 365 and Dynamics, which is trying to take share fromSalesforce.com, Inc.(NYSE:CRM) - will be another area of post-earnings analysis.Here's Why Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock     Will Hit $75What does that mean for Microsoft stock coming out of the Microsoft earnings report?Overall, it means that the quarter seems likely to be judged more on ""feel"" than on the hard numbers. Even though cloud and mobile still aren't the majority of MSFT revenue or earnings, they are the cornerstones of the Microsoft strategy going forward. And for now, it's relatively clear that the market is content to wait for those sales and profits - as long as it continues to trust in that strategy.If Microsoft can deliver another earnings report that shows growth is on the horizon, MSFT stock likely will rise - even if the headline numbers aren't perfect. But if there's any sort of stumble in either cloud or mobile, that investor patience could reverse - quickly.As of this writing, Vince Martin did not hold a position in   any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 High-Yield Dividend Stocks That Are SOMEHOW     Still Bargains7 Straight-A Stocks to Build Your Portfolio     AroundMicrosoft Corporation (MSFT) Is Building an AI     MonsterThe postMicrosoft Corporation (MSFT) Q2 Earnings Previewappeared first onInvestorPlace."

Tech Stock Roundup: AAPL-QCOM Deal, FB's Zuckerberg Testifies;1/25/2017;"With the 45thPresident of the United States vowing to bring back jobs to the country, teach China a lesson and institute large-scale tax reform, there has been a great deal of uncertainty surrounding technology stocks. To make matters worse, President Trump has an axe to grind with AmazonAMZNand AppleAAPLwhile most AlphabetGOOGLexecutives have openly supported the democrats going into the elections.So companies are now making nice with the President like Tesla's Elon Musk, who has changed tunes and is now tweeting his support. It's been reported that Google's Schmidt has also found reasons to visit the President. Executives that have supported Trump from the start are better off: some speculate that Zuckerberg is considering politics while ex-MicrosoftMSFTand GM employee Chris Liddell is moving to the White House as assistant to the President and director of strategic initiatives. Oracle CEO Safra Catz joined the executive committee of Trump's presidential transition team in December.Then there's Cramer, promising us that the post inauguration sell-off won't last and that it's actually an opportunity to buy stocks.Amidst all the excitement surrounding the swearing in, the FTC sued QualcommQCOMfor anti-competitive practices while Mark Zuckerberg took the stand to defend Facebook'sFBpurchase of Oculus. So let's dig in.Apple Forced to Use Qualcomm ChipsFollowing similar lawsuits, huge fines ($1 billion in China and $890 million in Korea) and anticompetitive investigations in Taiwan and the EU, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has sued Qualcomm for ""de facto exclusive deals that were as effective as express purchase requirements and that effectively foreclosed Qualcomm's competitors from gaining processor business at Apple.""The FTC alleges that Qualcomm allowed Apple billions in discounts for exclusively using its chips and not using the competing 4G Wi-Max standard that Intel was pushing. This agreement, running from 2011 to 2016, ultimately killed WiMax. Apple wasted no time in sourcing from Intel after the expiry of the agreement in Sep 2016.Another point in contention is Qualcomm's practice of limiting access to its cellular chips and then hiking royalty payments, amounting to ""a tax on the manufacturers' use of baseband processors manufactured by Qualcomm's competitors."" The FTC filed the lawsuit after a 2-1 vote. Qualcomm has of course denied the charges while Apple chose not to comment.Following the FTC lawsuit, Apple filed one of its own against Qualcomm for a billion dollars. The amount is what Apple alleges that Qualcomm is witholding for rebates. Like the FTC says, the deal was to keep Qualcomm chips in Apple products and is a fair indication that Qualcomm finally has some real competition.Mark Zuckerberg TestifiesFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg took the stand last week to deny charges that Facebook was aware of the violation of any employee agreement between Occulus head John Carmack and its former employer id Software, a unit of ZeniMax, the plaintiff in this case. He also denied that the technology developed by the startup Occulus and its founder Palmer Luckey was based on copyrighted technology belonging to ZeniMax.Carmack previously testified that he copied files from ZeniMax before moving to Occulus but did not use the information in Occulus and the terms of his employment allowed him to get involved with Occulus even while in ZeniMax employ. But the thing that could cost Facebook at this point is ZeniMax lawyer Toni Sammi's question: ""So your plan for a $2-point-something billion deal was to begin legal diligence on Friday, and sign the deal on Monday, over a weekend, right?"" to which Zuckerberg said, ""Yeah.""CompanyLast WeekLast  6 MonthsAAPL+2.09%+21.62%FB+0.33%+6.42%YHOO-0.14%+10.80%GOOGL-0.16%+9.94%MSFT+0.21%+16.26%INTC+0.63%+5.38%CSCO+0.20%+0.64%AMZN-0.65%+9.82%Other stories you might have missed-CorporateIndia Considering Apple Case: It's hard to tell just how badly India wants Apple to manufacture in the country. But if government officials agree to Apple's demands, it would indicate that they want it bad. Because Apple has asked for just about every concession possible, ranging from reduction in import duties on smartphones, customs duty exemption on manufacturing equipment and raw materials, a ""less-intrusive"" customs procedure to be completed in 30 minutes, the right to import and refurbish iPhones that are more than 3 years old so they can be exported, and so forth.Apple is trying to convince government officials that Indian made iPhones won't be competitive unless they give in to these demands even as its manufacturing costs in China are on the rise. But Asian phone makers are already manufacturing in the country with no such concessions, so the regulations themselves may need to be altered and relaxed to accommodate not just Apple but also other manufacturers. This could take time.On a positive note, Reuters reports that Information Technology Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad has mentioned the setting up of a government panel headed by the cabinet secretary that would now clear investment proposals in the electronics sector above $1 billion, instead of them going through multiple government departments.Microsoft Executive Joins Baidu: Baidu has appointed Qi Lu as its Chief Operating Officer and Group Head as it turns focus to artificial intelligence as the next growth driver. The company was mixed up in a scandal involving medical ads that led to stricter government regulations and consequently hit its revenues.Lu left Microsoft last year on health concerns but was in charge of its search business and also part of the team involved in architecting its artificial intelligence and bots technology. He holds more than 40 U.S. patents.Google Ad Auctions Are Suspect: The Wall Street Journal has independently confirmed that ads for Google products and the products of its sister companies usually find the top spot on the search engine results page. On checking 25K search results, it found that Google products occupied the top spot 91% of the time and the top two spots 43% of the time.Google has said that this is because it is also a buyer of ads, so its position comes from paying a higher price. It also says that this doesn't raise prices because when others bid for the price, it's as if Google isn't bidding. Bottom line: other advertisers lose the top spot no matter what they bid for it. Google reportedly removed its ads in a number of cases when confronted with the data last December.Amazon, Apple End Audiobook Exclusivity Deal: Apple and Amazon have decided to end the deal initiated back in 2008, according to which Amazon subsidiary Audible became the exclusive supplier of audiobooks to Apple and was barred from selling to any other party. The agreement was actually serving no one because the market for audiobooks has advanced since then and it's now in the interest of both parties to be able to source from others and in Audible's case, to also be able to sell on other platforms. Nonetheless, it was preceded by regulatory scrutiny of the deal by German and EU competition authorities that felt it was inflating prices.Pandora Shares Gain: Pandora preannounced fourth-quarter results that it said exceeded its revenue and EBITDA targets. This came as a relief because it has been lowering expectations the last two quarters indicating continuing bad news. Moreover, Pandora also said that the $5-a-month Pandora Plus garnered 365K new subscribers in the quarter and the Pandora Premium service remained on track to launch later this quarter. It also expects to lay off around 7% of the U.S. workforce, which will further boost margins.Legal/RegulatoryCisco-Arista Developments: The U.S. Customs and Border Patrol agency has expressed concern that its earlier decision to lift the ban on Arista switches may have been incorrect. Following conversations with CiscoCSCO, the CBP therefore intends to reinstate the ban. Arista has said that it will respond to Cisco points and re-engage with the CBP.In the meantime, U.S.-manufactured switches will have to make do, which can result in supply glitches and pressure on its gross margin. On Dec 2, the ITC judge ruled that Arista patents infringe on Cisco's and Arista has subsequently produced workaround while denying the charges. A full commission review of the judge's decision will be completed by Apr 9.New Technology/ProductsGoogle to Launch Android One Phones In U.S.: Google's high-end Pixel phones are mostly unavailable, but it's already gearing up to launch the low-end ($200-$300) Android One devices in the country by the middle of the year. The goal seems to be to build brand value and familiarize people with the Android ecosystem.Android One was first launched in India and later in other countries including Japan and then Europe. It is a system under which Google agrees beforehand with handset manufacturers to push out Android updates as soon as they are available so the experience is true to the latest iteration of the software.M&A and CollaborationsHPE Buying Simplivity: Hewlett Packard Enterprise is dishing out $650 million to buy SimpliVity, the second largest provider of hyperconvergence software (after Nutanix which has over 50% market share). The company describes a hyperconverged system as one that integrates compute, storage and networking into a pre-configured system, managed by a user-friendly software platform that doesn't require extensive IT staff for set up and management.Within a couple of months after the deal closes, HPE will offer a range of integrated HPE SimpliVity hyperconverged systems based on HPE ProLiant Servers. The acquisition significantly strengthens its position in the space where competitors like Cisco and Dell/EMC base their hyperconvergence solutions on market leader Nutanix or Simplivity software. HPE will initially support current SimpliVity customers.Cisco, Ericsson Join Forces in Australia: The collaboration between Ericsson and Cisco on telecom cloud infrastructure has yielded a major customer in Vodafone Hutchison Australia (VHA). The companies will virtualize Vodafone's infrastructure, enabling it to improve customer service and user experience while increasing network agility, reducing opex and capex, and speeding up the deployment of services. The partnership has reportedly generated 60 new deals and is expected to generate revenue of a billion dollars to each partner by 2018.Microsoft Acquires Simplygon: Microsoft has acquired 3D data optimization specialist Simplygon of Sweden for an undisclosed sum. This is intended to play an important role in developing its 3D For Everyone strategy, which is part of the Windows 10 Creators Update. 3D optimization is used by game developers and others to facilitate 3D content creation.Simplygon also does more than this: it has already started optimizing content for AR and VR technology, including for Microsoft's Hololens. Microsoft believes that by making the technology a part of its creators update, users will be empowered to capture, create and share 3D content thus augmenting their productivity, collaboration and creativity.Google Buys Twitter Developers Platform: Google has acquired Fabric, which is based on Crashlytics technology (crash analytics, app feedback and real-time analytics) that Twitter acquired back in 2013. Google hasn't said how much it's paying for Fabric, but has said that it will be a part of its cloud based mobile software effort called Firebase that was itself acquired in 2014. Firebase offers mobile app developers tools to build and monitor their apps, so any attempt to build its capabilities should help the company attract developers.Alibaba Has Long-term Digital Deal: Alibaba and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) signed a deal, according to which Alibaba will be responsible for the IOC's digital presence through its cloud platform. The deal makes Alibaba the digital sponsor of the Olympics in cloud services, e-commerce and television for a period running through 2028. While immediate returns may not there, this lends credibility to the service and should help Alibaba win big customer accounts.WDC Considering Toshiba Stake: Nikkei Asian Review has reported that Toshiba is looking to spin off or sell off a 20% stake in its chip business in which case Western Digital might be the one picking it up. Toshiba is in trouble right now as it has to deal with an unprofitable nuclear business and accounting scandal that requires it to cough up some cash. Selling off a share to its longtime partner Western Digital (the two operate a flash memory fab in Japan) might be just the answer it needs.Some NumbersUK App Store Prices Up: As a result of the pound's continued declines, Apple has been compelled to raise App store prices by as much as 25%.Intel Invests in Retail Tech: At the National Retail Federation's annual conference in New York, Intel said that it intended to invest $100 million in retail technology over the next five years. It also announced the Intel Responsive Retail Platform, which uses a combination of sensors, software kits and other hardware solutions to provide ""in-the-moment information about what customers are buying, what they want and how to manage inventory so it arrives just in time for customers to take it home"".Companies That Reported Results Last Week: CHKP, NFLX, PLXS, IBM, SWKSSome Companies Reporting This Week: CA, XLNX, FFIV, DST, AVT, YHOO, TXN, BABA, EBAY, LRCX, TER, GOOGL, KLAC, PYPL, IBM, SWKS, SIMO, GLW, STX, WDC, INTC, MSFT, JNPR, AMCC, VMW, SYNAZacks' Best Investment Ideas for Long-Term   ProfitToday you can gain access to long-term trades with double and triple-digit profit potential rarely available to the public.

Baidu Scoops Up AI Talent From Microsoft, But the Tech Titan Won't Be Left Behind;1/25/2017;"Baidu(NASDAQ: BIDU) has made no secrets aboutits ambitionsin the area of artificial intelligence (AI). CEO Robin Li has   said that this is the end of the mobile era and the beginning of   the AI era. Baidu sees AI as a ""key strategic focus for the   next decade."" To that end, it continues to hire some of the   foremost minds in AI for key positions in the company.The brightest minds in AI. Image source: Pixabay.Hiring the best and brightestNews broke earlier this month that Baidu hired Dr. Qi Lu as   its chief operating officer. Lu was most recentlyMicrosoft's(NASDAQ: MSFT)  global executive vice president of   applications and services group. According to his LinkedIn   profile, Lu was responsible for ""all of the research and   development teams across Microsoft Office, Office 365,   SharePoint, Exchange, Yammer, Skype for Business, Skype, Bing,   and the Advertising platform."" While in charge of R&D,   he directed Microsoft's advances in AI and the pursuit of bot   technology during his tenure. He stepped down from his   duties at Microsoft several months ago to recover from a bicycle   accident and it was not clear if or when he would return.makeArticleAd();Lu has a PhD in computer science from Carnegie Mellon   University and is recognized as a leader in the field of AI. He   has been issued 40 U.S. patents and published papers in AI   research. He previously worked as a research staff member atIBM's(NYSE: IBM) Almaden Research Center, which performs much   of the company'sAI-related researchand is the storehouse of IBM's AI figurehead andJeopardy!-winning contestant, Watson. The AI and machine learning   developed there and integrated into IBM's cognitive computing   business produced 35% of IBM's full-year revenue for   2015. The research done here was likely the genesis for Lu's   later interest in AI and the direction he took while at   Microsoft.Microsoft making acquisitions of its ownMicrosoft pursuit of deep learning. Image source:Pixabay.Microsoft continues to pursue its own AI agenda. On the heels   of Lu's departure, it was revealed that Microsoft had acquired   Maluuba, a company that specializes in deep learning and   reinforced learning in the field of AI. The company has made   several AI-related acquisitions in the last few years, but this   is the first that focuses on teaching computers to learn in the   same way as the human brain. To achieve this also requires large   amounts of data for the system to learn. Maluuba's technology   combined with data gained from the acquisition of LinkedIn late   last year gives Microsoft the tools necessary to expand its AI   initiatives.Fitting right inLu will be a natural fit in helping Baidu pursue its AI   agenda. In an interview last year, Lu expressed his frustration   with the state of the mobile experience and apps in general. Lu   believes that the next-generation platform will be led by speech   technology. He said, ""We see a full spectrum of using language as   the baseline, but using graphical interactions in a thoughtful,   meaningful way, to elevate the experience."" That may provide us   insight into some of the places that Baidu will go under his   guidance.For Baidu, this isn't the first such high-profile hiring of an   AI expert. In 2014, it hired Andrew Ng, its chief scientist, who   was previously the lead ofAlphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL)Google Brain projectand an adjunct professor at Stanford University where he taught   AI. This shows that Baidu is willing to make bold moves in order   to succeed in AI.In the press release announcing Lu's hiring, Baidu's CEO Robin   Li had this to say: ""To achieve our goals, especially in   artificial intelligence, which is a key strategic focus for the   next decade, we will need to continue attracting the best global   talent. With Dr. Lu on board, we are confident that our strategy   will be executed smoothly and Baidu will become a world-class   technology company and global leader in AI.""10 stocks we like better than BaiduWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

These 5 Stocks Drive Vanguard High Dividend Yield's Performance;1/25/2017;"Dividend stocks have been a lifesaver for investors who need   income from their investment portfolios, especially in light of   rock-bottom interest rates on bonds and other fixed-income   assets. In particular,Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF(NYSEMKT: VYM) offers a low-cost way to get diversified exposure   to more than 400 stocks, all of which have above-average dividend   yields.Yet as with most funds, a substantial portion of the Vanguard   ETF's assets go toward just a handful of stocks, and the ETF's   top-five holdings make up nearly 20% of the entire portfolio.   Let's look more closely at the stocks that Vanguard High Dividend   Yield ETF sees as being most important to its success.Image source: Getty Images.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF's top holdingsStockPercent of PortfolioMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT)5.14%ExxonMobil(NYSE: XOM)4.12%Johnson & Johnson(NYSE: JNJ)3.46%JPMorgan Chase(NYSE: JPM)3.41%General Electric(NYSE: GE)3.06%Data source: Morningstar.What the Vanguard ETF's top holdings say about its   strategyInvestors look to dividend ETFs to provide a combination of   high income and broad-based diversification. The fund's   five-largest holdings show how Vanguard High Dividend Yield   achieves both of those goals. With exposure to technology,   energy, healthcare, financials, and industrials, the five stocks   above would make up an impressive mini-portfolio in their own   right. Moreover, they all have better dividend yields than the   overall market, ranging from JPMorgan Chase's 2.3% yield to the   3.5% that ExxonMobil currently pays.Yet in some ways, the fact that the Vanguard ETF's top-five   holdings are as diverse as they are is just an accident of the   market. The ETF tracks the FTSE High Dividend Yield Index, which   weights its components by market capitalization. It's only   because Microsoft has the highest valuation of any of the   companies in the index that it shows up at the top of the   list.That's not the way all dividend ETFs work. Some base their   weightings on the actual dividends that each component pays.   Under that rubric, ExxonMobil would have a heavier weighting than   Microsoft because the energy giant's dividend payments on an   annual basis are higher than what the tech behemoth pays. The net   impact on performance is to keep the Vanguard ETF's returns more   in line with large-cap stock indexes, generally, because the   relative weightings will be similar to the broader index.How Vanguard High Dividend Yield's top holdings have   faredDividend stocks have been extremely popular, and all five of   the stocks above have given investors double-digit returns over   the past year, contributing to the Vanguard ETF's performance.   JPMorgan Chase has led the way with gains of more than 55%, as   the rise in interest rates and more favorable conditions in the   financial markets have combined to give the Wall Street banking   colossus a more encouraging outlook going forward. Microsoft has   produced 26% returns over the past year as it continues to find   ways to navigate changing emphasis areas in the tech   industry.For ExxonMobil, the stock's 19% return has come on the heels   of an impressive rebound in energy prices from their lows in   early 2016. Yet even with the gains, crude oil in the $50s still   has room to run higher, and some ExxonMobil investors are   counting on seeing further gains in order to support earnings and   dividends more securely. Meanwhile, Johnson & Johnson also   produced 19% gains for shareholders over the past year, riding   the success of its pharmaceutical segment, but making key gains   in its medical device and consumer products businesses, as   well.General Electric brings up the rear with gains of just 10%.   Yet GE has equally solid potential as it continues to key in on   its core industrial exposure. Having largely moved out of the   volatile financials arena following the financial crisis in 2008   and early 2009, General Electric now hopes that investments in   areas like aerospace, energy, and healthcare will keep paying off   in the future.Keep watchingdividend   stocksWith these stocks in its arsenal, the Vanguard High Dividend   Yield ETF has the capacity to keep delivering on the dividend   front. With high yields, income investors will be pleased to see   these five stocks and the rest of the ETF's portfolio generate   solid dividends both now and in the future.10 stocks we like better than Vanguard High Dividend     Yield ETFWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Here’s Why Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock Will Hit $75;1/25/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIt's no longer the mid-1990's, but if you've blinked, you might have missed how quicklyMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) transformed from a slow-moving bellwether to fast-growing tech company again.makeArticleAd();Source:Johannes Marliem Via FlickrAnd this time, Windows and Office - while still huge money makers for the company - are not the products doing the heavy lifting. And thatbodes wellfor MSFT stock.The Nadella EffectNew CEO Satya Nadella deserves much of the credit for the turnaround in Microsoft and MSFT stock. Since Nadella was was appointed as CEO on Feb. 4, 2014, Microsoft shares have skyrocketed as much as 75%, when factoring its 52-week high of $64.10 reached on Dec. 23.That comes out to 25% annual returns. And for a number of catalysts currently in play, MSFT stock is poised to reach $75 in the next 12 to 18 months, delivering some 25% returns.Not only has the market rewarded Nadella for moving Microsoft toward high-growth areas such as the cloud with Office 365 and the company's dominant Azure platform, Nadella has - in the process - made investors forget Microsoft's failures under former CEO Steve Ballmer. Notably, missing out on mobile and being surpassed by the likes ofApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) andSamsung Electronics(OTCMKTS:SSNLF).10 High-Yield Dividend Stocks That Are SOMEHOW Still BargainsBut thanks to Nadella's strong pulse on the company, Microsoft won't miss out on anymore opportunities.The M&A EffectTake, for example, last week'sacquisition of Simplygon, a company that develops 3D-optimization solutions for video game developers and other industries that need to visualize 3D data. Microsoft didn't reveal how much it paid for Simplygon, not that its price is important. What matters is the extent to which this deal can help Microsoft leverage its existing ""3D to everyone"" initiative, which makes it easy to capture, create and share in 3D images.The deal for Simplygon follows last Friday's deal for artificial intelligence (AI) startupMaluuba, which specializes in deep learning and reinforcement learning. And to say nothing about its $26.2 billion blockbuster deal for LinkedIn Corp, which closed in December.With almost $140 billion in cash on its balance sheet, there's not much Microsoft can't afford. And Satya seems determined to deploy the company's cash to ensure Microsoft's growth never peaks.Bottom Line on MSFT StockMicrosoft stock - currently priced at a forward price-earnings ratio of just 19 - deserves a higher multiple. With growth opportunities emerging in the realm of Internet of Things, smart homes, the cloud and now 3D and AI, MSFT stock - despite trading near all-time highs - still looks attractive.The LinkedIn deal, which exposes Microsoft to a new set of growth areas such as advertising, putting it in the realm ofFacebook Inc(NASDAQ:FB), deserves an additional three to four points above Microsoft's current P/E.Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Q4 Earnings PreviewLooking out to the next 12 to 18 months, MSFT stock is poised to reach $75, when assigning a P/E of 23 (compared to Facebook's 24) to fiscal 2017 estimates of the $3.27 per share.Aside from delivering 10% earnings growth in 2017, MSFT stock pays a 2.5% dividend yield, making it one of the better bargains in tech.As of this writing, Richard Saintvilus did not hold any a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceCan the Shark Tank Make These 3 Canadian Stocks Great Again?The 3 Best Under-the-Radar Trump Stocks to BuyThe postHere's Why Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock Will Hit $75appeared first onInvestorPlace."

Why Apple Inc. Stock (AAPL) Was Downgraded Ahead Of Earnings;1/25/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsApple Inc.(AAPL) stock was little changed in early trading on Tuesday before rallying in Wednesday morning trading following a rare downgrade from analysts atBarclays.makeArticleAd();The iPhone maker is scheduled to release its next earnings report on Jan. 31, and the story on Wall Street is weak iPhone 7 sales.Still, some are finding cause to remain positive as consumers seem to be favoring the more expensive iPhone 7 Plus, which of course is a good thing for the average selling price. Barclays' downgrade follows aprice target increaselast week.Apple Stock DowngradedIn a research note Tuesday morning, Barclays analyst Mark Moskowitz went so far as to say that he doesn't see any big catalysts for Apple stock for the next 12 months. This implies that he's not even sure that the iPhone 8 will move the needle on sales enough to boost investor confidence, at least in the early days. Twelve months will bring us past the launch of this year's iPhone models.The analyst downgraded Apple stock from ""Overweight""to ""Equal-weight""and trimmed his price target by $2 to $117 per share.Part of Moskowitz's newfound bearishness on Apple stock is less company-specific and more about the decelerating smartphone sales being felt across the industry.10 Stocks to Buy for Donald Trump's Second WindLooking out to the long term, however, he feels that the stickiness of the iPhone maker's ecosystem, big cash stash and tenth anniversary iPhone (widely expected to bethe iPhone 8) will serve as a support for investors.Here's how two additional analysts view the future prospects for AAPL stock…Buy AAPL On a PullbackPacific Crestanalyst Andy Hargreaves said on Monday that investors should think about buying Apple stock on a ""meaningful pullback."" Although he thinks December quarter sales might be in line with consensus, he warned that March quarter sales could decline on the back of the iPhone's weakest sell-through data ever.However, he maintained his ""Overweight""rating and $127 price target on Apple stock.UBSanalyst Steven Milunovich also has $127 price target paired with a Buy rating on Apple stock, and he said in a note dated Jan. 24 that the CIRP survey suggests a mix shift toward the iPhone 7 Plus and models with more storage in the U.S., both of which are good for the average selling price.The survey indicated that 42% of iPhone sales were the Plus models, a much greater percentage than last year's 26%. Sixty-two percent of buyers favored the $100 or $200 step-ups in storage, and Android switchers remained stable even as the upgrade rate was strong.Milunovich is concerned about China and currency headwinds even though he still looks for iPhone growth in the double digits for fiscal 2018. He expects continued declines in China.Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Q4 Earnings PreviewFurther, the higher bill of materials for the iPhone 7 lineup could offset the mix shift toward more expensive models, pressuring the gross margin.The UBS analyst is roughly in line with consensus on Apple'sDecember quarter earnings. He's looking for $77.8 billion in sales, compared to the consensus of $77.4 billion and toward the high end of the company's outlook of $76 billion to 78 billion.He pegs the iPhone maker's earnings per share at $3.24 and its iPhone units at 76 million, compared to the Street's estimate of 78 million.

Apple Inc. (AAPL) iPhone Takes a Hit From … Netflix, Inc.? (NFLX);1/25/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhenApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) designed the iPhone and iOS mobile operating system, the company chose to exclude support for external storage. On the other hand, many smartphones runningAlphabet Inc's(NASDAQ:GOOGL) Android operating system included the ability to supplement onboard storage using inexpensive SD memory cards. Not a game-changer, clearly.Source: TwitterButNetflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX) just made the difference a little more important, by adding support for Netflix downloads to SD cards on Android.makeArticleAd();To SD or Not to SDFrom the start, AAPL spurned the idea of giving iPhone (or iPad) users access to external storage. The company designed iOS to hide file directories from the user level - keeping the user interface extremely simple - and that meant not being able to choose whether to save a file in built-in storage, or in external storage.Besides keeping the user interface clean and easier to support, the move also was a financial windfall for Apple. Without any option to boost storage, users who wanted more than the bare minimum would be forced to pay for the next tier in iPhones. So that $649 base model became $749.AAPL's profit margin on that extra $100 was considerable, since the flash memory used for storage is inexpensive.For point of comparison, going from 32GB to 128GB on the iPhone 7 is an extra $100, while a 128GB microSD card can be had for $50. And that's paying retail prices, which AAPL most certainly does not.Google, on the other hand, supported the use of SD cards for external storage. It was limited at first, but by Android Marshmallow, Android users could use that extra storage for virtually anything, including apps. They could buy cheap, lower-capacity micro SD cards and swap them out at will.10 Companies That Are Bringing Jobs Back to     AmericaThis was a very popular feature, asSamsung Electronics Co Ltd(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) discovered when it ditched the feature on the Galaxy S6. After the outcry, the capabilityreturned with the Galaxy S7.Netflix Downloads Makes SD Card Support a Bigger DealThe announcement of Netflix downloads for iOS and Android was a very popular move. Watching video on a smartphone is popular, but cellular data isn't cheap. The new feature meant you could watch Netflix on iPhone or Android devices while commuting, traveling of just hanging around - without worrying about a big data bill.Yesterday, Netflix downloads gainedSD card support on Android. Suddenly, those cheap storage cards - that the iPhone cannot use - became a bigger deal. One hour of HD video downloaded to a mobile device from Netflixuses about 440MB of storage space.With movies approaching 1GB each, you can see how this could add up quickly.For travelers using Netflix on iPhone, the downloads could turn into an exercise in strategic file management.

Tech Stock Earnings Slated on Jan 26: MSFT, GOOGL, PYPL;1/25/2017;"The fourth-quarter earnings season is underway with results from 63 S&P 500 members or 19.2% of the index's total market capitalization already out (as of Jan 20).Per the latestEarnings Preview, total earnings of these index members are up 4.7% year over year on the back of 2.7% higher revenues. Beat ratios are impressive with 66.7% beating earnings estimates and 50.8% coming ahead of revenue expectations.Notably, earnings and revenue growth numbers are better than the recent quarters and on track to cross the highest level in the last eight quarters. However, positive earnings surprises are tracking low at this stage compared with the past quarters.Technology SectorTechnology will be in the spotlight this week, with several major companies including MicrosoftMSFT, IntelINTCand AlphabetGOOGLaka Google scheduled to report results this week. As per our latest report, 10.1% of the technology sector's total market capitalization on the S&P 500 index reported their results.Total earnings of these tech companies are up 1% from the same period last year on 2.2% higher revenues, with 85.7% beating earnings estimates and 71.4% surpassing revenue expectations. Per the report, technology earnings are expected to be up 3.6% on 4.3% higher revenues.Among the technology firms slated to report their quarterly earnings on Jan 26, let's see what's ahead for these three:Microsoft Corporation, one of the largest broad-based technology providers in the world, is slated to release second-quarter fiscal 2017 results.According to our model, a company needs the right combination of two key ingredients - a positiveEarnings ESPand a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) - to increase its odds of an earnings surprise.Consequently, we do not expect the company to post an earnings beat since it carries a Zacks Rank #2 and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with ourEarnings ESP Filter.Microsoft is benefiting from its hybrid and hyperscale cloud, which spans multiple jurisdictions, making it ideal for multinational companies and banks that have operations worldwide and are required to be in compliance with laws of the countries in which they operate.Microsoft cites this as the primary reason behind drawing 80% of the world's largest banks to Azure. Moreover, the company's expanding cloud services have also helped it to capture big customers like Boeing, Rolls-Royce, Schneider Electric and Facebook.Notably, Microsoft results surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the preceding four quarters. It has an average four-quarter positive surprise of 10.55%.Coming to the share price, Microsoft underperformed the Zacks categorizedComputer Softwareindustry over the last one year. While the industry gained 21.57%, the stock gave a positive return of only 21.96%.Microsoft Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseMicrosoft Corporation Price and EPS Surprise|Microsoft Corporation QuoteWe also don't expectAlphabet Inc., a leading provider of target-based advertisements on the web, to post an earnings beat when it reports fourth-quarter 2016 results.This is because the company has a Zacks Rank #2 but an Earnings ESP of -0.26%. We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Strong Sell) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.However, Alphabet's top line is expected to benefit from strength in the mobile platform. Also, YouTube remains a strong contributor benefiting from the increase in online video consumption. (Read More:Alphabet: Will it Beat Earnings Estimates in Q4?)We note that the surprise history has been decent in Alphabet's case. The company missed estimates just once in the last four quarters, that too by a small margin. It has an average four-quarter positive surprise of 4.55%.Over the past one year, shares of Alphabet outperformed the Zacks categorizedInternet Servicesindustry. While the industry grew 15.10%, the stock returned 14.67%.Alphabet Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseAlphabet Inc. Price and EPS Surprise|Alphabet Inc. QuoteSimilarly, we don't expectPayPal Holdings, Inc.PYPL, a worldwide online payments system operator, to outperform estimates when it reports fourth-quarter 2016 results. The company has a Zacks Rank #2 and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.Partnership and mobile centrism continues to be PayPal's top priorities. The company's ongoing strategic partnerships with Visa and MasterCard offer great flexibility and choice to consumers. Partnerships with Facebook, Apple, and Alibaba are also reaping results. (Read More:What to Expect from PayPal this Earnings Season?)However, PayPal's surprise history is impressive as it surpassed estimates in three of the last four quarters and matched estimates on one occasion. It has an average four-quarter positive surprise of 7.09%.Over the last one year, the stock has outperformed the ZacksInternet - Softwareindustry.

The Tech Battle for the Classroom Is Heating Up;1/24/2017;"Image source: Getty Images.Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) has been making steady gains in   the classroom, thanks to the Chromebook. The search giant is   looking to maintain that momentum and has just announced two new   Chromebooks that are specifically designed for the educational   market. Google is also taking the opportunity to share a few data   points. There are now 20 million teachers and students using   Chromebooks and Google Classroom, and over 70 million people now   use G Suite for Education, the company's online productivity   suite that's tailored for educational purposes.makeArticleAd();A tale of two new educational ChromebooksThe two new devices are the Acer Chromebook Spin 11 and the   ASUS Chromebook C213. Google says it collaborated with educators   to include features that would specifically help in the   classroom. Specifically, that includes stylus support for   students to draw and take notes. In order to keep costs down, the   styluses are cheap, don't need to be charged or paired, and are   easily replaced if lost. This move is clearly designed to broaden   appeal by offering something that tablets do.In May 2016, Google said it was bringing Android apps to   Chrome OS. This was part of Google's broader strategy to merge   Chrome OS and Android. Administrators will be able to install   Android apps on educational Chromebooks, which is a big win   considering how much more educational content is available for   Android.Microsoft wants inChromebooks and tablets have largely displaced low-costMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) PCs, but the software giant is fighting back.   Microsoft also just announced Intune for Education. Intune is the   company's mobile device management offering, which has   historically been catered to the enterprise. Intune for Education   will be a cloud-based application for device management, which   will allow administrators to manage a group of Windows 10 devices   in educational settings. Microsoft says this is one of two   critical pieces that it has been missing in the educational   market, with the other being affordable Windows 10 PCs.Video source: Microsoft.Microsoft makes it clear that it's taking a direct shot at   Chromebooks, saying, ""New Windows 10 Devices Offer Great   Alternatives to Chromebooks."" The company is unveiling a slew of   new Windows 10 devices that are targeting education, fromHP, Acer, and Lenovo.Where's Apple?A few years back,Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) tried to position the iPad as the ideal   educational computing device, but for the most part those   aspirations have fallen flat. Chromebooks are able to undercut   iPads by a significant margin, and the presence of an attached   keyboard is important for education and productivity. Many of the   Chromebooks and Windows PCs that are gaining traction in the   educational market are priced at just $150 to $300; the cheapest   iPad is the aging iPad Mini 2 that was launched in 2013 and   currently costs $269.The educational market has long been important to Apple from a   philosophical perspective, if not a financial one. But prices   continue to fall, hindering Apple's ability to compete.   Importantly, 2-in-1 devices are expected to continue growing in   education, and Apple does not offer a full-fledged 2-in-1   product.It looks like Microsoft and Google may end up winning the   battle for the classroom.10 stocks we like better than MicrosoftWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) Q4 Earnings Preview: Pixel & Home Could Fuel Growth;1/24/2017;"As per usual, all eyes will be on the company formerly known as Google, Alphabet Inc.GOOGL, as the tech giant prepares to release its fourth-quarter earnings report on Thursday. The company rolled out its new Google Pixel phone and ushered in a new era of hardware-software interaction during the quarter, making this week's announcement even more important than usual.In fact, the Google Pixel will most likely be the most compelling aspect of Alphabet's latest report, and investors will be clamoring to know how the device sold. It will also be interesting to see what the company says about its Google Home Controller, which also launched in the U.S. this quarter.The Google Pixel is important because it is Alphabet's first high-end smartphone entirely produced in-house and represents a significant challenge to Apple'sAAPLiPhone line. The Google Home tells another story of competition; the ""Internet of Things"" in-home hub is one of the only competitors to Amazon'sAMZNEcho speaker.More importantly, both of these products underscore Alphabet's efforts to usher in its intelligent personal assistant software, Google Assistant. With similar functions to Apple's Siri and Microsoft'sMSFTCortana, Google Assistant is the backbone of the Pixel and Home devices and promises to be the foundation for all of Google's original products heading forward.Also, investors should not forget about the other products that Google launched in the quarter, all of which were officially unveiled at the same event in October. The company debuted its stylish headset for the Daydream VR platform, the ""Daydream View,"" as well as its first router, ""Google Wifi,"" and a Chromecast update, ""Chromecast Ultra.""All of these products are important pieces of Google's effort to create a complete line of products that work together and with the new Google Assistant software. This is just the first quarter of sales, but it is also the holiday quarter and should give us a good idea of whether or not these products are resonating with shoppers.Heading into the report, Alphabet Inc. has seen one positive estimate revision over the past week. Our current consensus estimates indicate EPS growth of 8.40% and sales growth of 18.75%, and this has helped earn the company an ""A"" grade for growth. This is especially noteworthy given the relative size and status of Alphabet already. Overall, the stock has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), and that's always a good sign heading into an earnings announcement.Nevertheless, Alphabet currently has an Earnings ESP of -0.26%, which makes surprise prediction a bit more difficult.Zacks' Top 10 Stocks for 2017In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest tickers for the entirety of 2017?Who wouldn't?

Why 2017 Will Be the Year of the Virtual Assistant;1/24/2017;"In its annual mobile apps survey, Research firm Gartner   predicted that by 2019 virtual assistants will account for20% of all smartphone interactions. With that level of user engagement,  predictably all of   the largest technology companies are invested in the segment and   each brings a different strength to the field.Will 2017 be the year of the virtual assistant?  Image   source: Pixabay.makeArticleAd();Amazon Echo powered by Alexa. Image source: Amazon.com.AmazonMany media reports  are callingAmazon's(NASDAQ: AMZN) Alexa the hit of the Consumer Electronics Show.    In 2015, Amazon made a skills kit available to developers   that allowed partners to incorporate voice commands. Fast forward   to 2017 and Alexa can integrate with an estimated 5,000   third-party apps,  from refrigerators to TV's, from cars to   vacuums, and lest we forget, the Echo smart home speaker.    The novelty of this device made it among the top selling   items on Amazon's website during the holidays. This was a   brilliant strategic move by a company without a smartphone as an   installed base. Amazon does, however, have a roster of well-known   companies in its corner including Ford, Samsung and LG to name a   few. In addition to product integration, Alexa can be found in a   dizzying number of bots that can order a pizza from Domino's,   schedule an Uber, or check your Capital One balance. This gives   Amazon the early lead in terms of reach and momentum, but the   lack of a mobile device means that challenges remain.Apple's Siri. Image source: Apple.AppleApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) , represented in the category by Siri, hasn't seen   much love. Her earliest incarnation could only answer correctly   about 65% of the time,  and users complained that far too   often she defaulted to Google rather than answering the question.   Consumers tend to remember those early first experiences, and   Siri still has a bad reputation. She shouldn't be counted out   yet, though. Apple has been taking steps to improve Siri's   understanding. In mid-2014, Siri's brain was replaced by an   artificial intelligence (AI) based neural network and Apple   claims that Siri now has a less than 5% error rate. Apple argues   that it isn't necessary to upload all of your data to the cloud   in order for Siri to improve. It uses a technique called   differential privacy, which keeps individual information at the   local phone level and protects user privacy.  Though it   currently doesn't have a, Echo-like voice-activated speaker,reports indicatethat a prototype is currently in the testing stage.Google Home powered by Google Assistant. Image source:     Google.AlphabetAlphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google has introduced Google   Assistant, which expands on the capabilities of Google Now and OK   Google. This assistant is currently available on its Pixel phones   and can be accessed on other smartphones via the Google Allo app.   This virtual helper is more conversational and has produced   impressive early results due to experiences gained from its   predecessors. It was found to rival and in many cases surpass its   nearest competitors. Assistant's greatest strength may be the   ability to answer follow-up questions, a feature many of its   rivals lack. Integration with Google Home smart speaker puts it   squarely in competition with Amazon's Echo. Its strengths include   entire home synchronized audio and grouping of smart-home   commands.Some researchersbelieve that Alexa will cede its early lead in the category to   Google Assistant by 2020.Microsoft Cortana. Image source: Microsoft.MicrosoftMicrosoft's(NASDAQ: MSFT) Cortana is available across its Windows 10-based   devices including phones, tablets and PC's. It has many competing   features, but has exhibited difficulties responding to requests,   reminiscent of Siri's early days. Microsoft announced late last   year that it would open Cortana to third party integration, so   expect a number of hardware integrations on the horizon. It has   yet to introduce an interactive speaker, but its first hardware   partner is Harman Kardon and one is expected sometime this year.    In a shrewd move, the kit used by developers is remarkably   similar to that of Alexa, allowing them to piggyback off the work   they have already done. This will accelerate the process of   producing hardware that will integrate Cortana.Near-ubiquitous technologyThose interested in a task-based comparison between the four   might findthis articlebyBusiness Insiderof interest. Despite the varying capabilities among these   entries, one thing is clear: nearly every person with a computer,   tablet, smartphone, or home speaker system will have access to a   virtual personal assistant in the coming year. With this level of   exposure, consumers will begin to adopt these virtual assistants,   and as the technology becomes more advanced, providers will find   new, more innovative ways to incorporate them into our everyday   lives. Society is still in the early stages of the adoption cycle   for these digital helpers, but it appears that this year is the   tipping point.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock       tip, it can pay to listen.

Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Is Building an AI Monster;1/24/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading     TipsWhen investors think of artificial intelligence stocks,Microsoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) isn't usually the first name that comes to mind. Many consumers   viewAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) as the leader in at-home AI, due to the success of the   company's Echo device, while ""Watson"" fromInternational Business Machines Corp.(NYSE:IBM) is arguably the top turn-key artificial intelligence solution   for enterprise-level entities.Those investors who believe AI is the future, however, may want   to put MSFT stock back on their radar as a way to play the   movement.makeArticleAd();The software giant's recent acquisition of Maluuba speaks   volumes about its artificial intelligence ambitions and what it   actually wants to ""do"" with it.What's Maluuba?Maluuba isn't a household name, but within artificial   intelligence circles (and these are VP of AI Research Harry Shum's   words), ""Maluuba's vision is to advance toward a more general   artificial intelligence by creating literate machines that can   think, reason and communicate like humans - a vision exactly in   line with ours.""In simpler terms, the AI agent doesn't just serve up a   canned response to the most likely question it thinks it's being   asked based on keywords. Rather, Maluuba understands the words   being used,their context, and what information is desired. The utility of such a tool   could vary from finding a specific qualification or experience   from within a company's ranks to a chatbot that actually works   without talking in circles.Those are just small examples of how a   next-generation artificial intelligence - called artificial   general intelligence, in this case - could be used and monetized.   In September, when Microsoft assembled 5,000 engineers to work on   AI, Shum specifically pointed out that such a technology could   not only make Cortana and Skype more potent, butcould be incorporated into Microsoft's popular   cloud-based apps such as Office 365 and Azureto enhance the ease-of-use factor for those platforms.7 Blue-Chip Dividend Stocks That Are Dead       Weight Right NowYou Ain't Seen Nothin' YetIt's difficult to see, or sense, but Microsoft is developing   its AGI know-how with as much of a philosophical bent as it is a   technical one.Just in time, too. AsCIO's Matt Kapko observed in December, ""While machine learning has generated tremendous interest   throughout the enterprise, a wide gap still exists between   research and beneficial use cases in the real world.""The ramped-up focus on AI (and this happened well before   Maluuba) couldn't have come at a better time for Microsoft,   either, and by extension, for owners of MSFT stock.Calling a spade a spade, Microsoft largely missed out on the   early phase of artificial intelligence; now it's play catch up.   It's playing it well, though, particularly focusing on ""bots"" -   or chatbots that can intelligently text-chat with a user - as the   organization believes that's the interface that makes the most   sense of such a platform. This kind of AI could potentially   replace many of the touch-based apps found on your smartphone   withone voice-based conversational tool that actually   does everythingthe way you want it done.President and principal analyst of Moor Insights &   Strategy, Patrick Moorhead, has taken notice, too, commenting   last month that ""Microsoft surprised everyone in 2016 and I'm   expecting more surprises in 2017."" Specifically, Moorhead   believes Microsoft will unveil an artificial intelligence that   will not only be more powerful to individual consumers than   Amazon's Echo, but will also serve a specific business (read   ""revenue-bearing"") function. Incorporating Maluuba's know-how   will only move the company closer to that end zone.At stake is a piece of a market thatcould be worth $16.6 billion by 2022. Tractica thinks the artificial intelligence market willbe worth $36.8 billion by 2025. Both are a far cry from 2016's estimated global AI revenue of   $644 million.Now, all of a sudden, Microsoft's intense interest makes   sense.Bottom Line for MSFT StockNone of this is to suggest that that MSFT stock should be   viewed first and foremost as an artificial intelligence stock,   now or later. It's still a productivity-solutions stock, and AI   simply helps the organization provide better solutions.7 Stocks to Buy to Double Your Money in       2017Nevertheless, Microsoft may well be working on one of the most   marketable uses of artificial intelligence, serving enterprises   in a very real way - beyond the home-utility that the Echo   provides, while not imposing overkill with something   like IBM's Watson. MSFT owners may soon find Microsoft quietly   winning the AI war with an elegant, customizable solution to real   challenges.Even if few have come to fully appreciate just how potent this   artificial intelligence product is.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position     in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceThe Top Dividend Stocks to Buy for Safety in       201710 Dividend Growth Stocks That Simply Print       Money7 Stocks to Sell Before They ImplodeThe postMicrosoft Corporation (MSFT) Is Building an AI   Monsterappeared first onInvestorPlace."

The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $345.3 million. Non-GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations are likely to range within 18 cents to 25 cents. GAAP earnings are expected in the range of 17-26 cents.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Teradyne will beat estimates this quarter.

How Microsoft Has Changed in the Past 3 Years;1/24/2017;"Satya Nadella became CEO ofMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) about three years ago, with his formal appointment   coming on Feb. 4, 2014. It was an inspired pick that also   represented a change in tone from previous boss Steve Ballmer.   What wasn't known at the time is just how radically Nadella would   divert from the strategies of his predecessor and founder/CEO   Bill Gates before him.Nadella wasn't another member of the old guard taking over. He   wasn't a Gates disciple who'd been around since the early days of   the company in the mid-1970s, but having started in 1992. He did   have a strong base of knowledge about where the company was and   where it needed to go. When he took over, he made it very clear   that changes were coming and they were going to come quickly.""Microsoft is one of those rare companies to have truly   revolutionized the world through technology, and I couldn't be   more honored to have been chosen to lead the company,"" Nadella   said in apress releaseat the time. ""The opportunity ahead for Microsoft is vast, but to   seize it, we must focus clearly, move faster, and continue to   transform. A big part of my job is to accelerate our ability to   bring innovative products to our customers more quickly.""makeArticleAd();Those remarks would prove prescient, as it's fair to say   Nadella quickly changed how Microsoft does business. It was a   radical remake that turned a still-successful tech dinosaur into   a company built for the future as well as the present.Microsoft has changed dramatically in three years under   Nadella. Image source: Microsoft.How has Microsoft changed?Under Gates and Ballmer, Microsoft operated in a closed   ecosystem. The company wanted people to buy Windows computers, so   it generally kept its products inside that system. There wereApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Mac versions of Office, but even those weren't   updated nearly as often as the Windows versions -- and they only   succeeded because so few options existed.Trying to keep everything in the Windows world backfired on   Microsoft when iOS and Android phones and tablets exploded. Not   having key products such as the various Office programs in the   two major app stores started teaching a generation of younger   folks that there were alternatives.Nadella quickly changed that. In November 2014, he brought the   signature productivity suite to Apple iOS and Android devices. In   addition, the company offered up free versions of programs   including Word, Excel, and PowerPoint that allowed for viewing   documents, as well as some limited editing.These moves, which the new CEO pushed through, also helped   Microsoft change its business model for these programs. Rather   than pushing Office as a one-time sale, the company moved users   toward subscriptions. That was made much easier by Microsoft's   newfound willingness to allow consumers to use Office on whatever   device they wanted, instead of just Windows machines.A different companyIf Microsoft had kept the walls up, it probably would have had   a long future as a steadily shrinking business selling to a core   group of business users. With its new strategy, the company has   been able to introduce Office, Skype, and even Windows to a new   generation while creating a steady flow of subscription revenue.   For example, revenue for Office 365, the name for the   subscription plan, was up nearly 70% in Q2 2016.In addition to opening up the company's products to Apple and   Android products, Nadella has also been a decisive leader. He   made the bold decision to scrap Windows 8 and distance the   company from it by moving right to Windows 10 -- a revamp that   brought back many well-liked features. He was also quick to back   away from the Windows Phone, even if that meant admitting that   the company largely wasted $7.6 billion buyingNokia's devices division.Nadella has also been a strong champion of innovation at his   company. He supported the struggling Surface hybrid, which has   slowly become a strength for Microsoft. In addition, the CEO has   backed HoloLens, a future-looking platform that could help bring   virtual and augmented reality into the mainstream.Microsoft is hip nowCompared with Apple, Microsoft was always square. That's why   the old ""I'm a Mac/I'm a PC"" commercials worked. Now, under   Nadella, Microsoft no longer feels the same. It still may not be   quite as hip as Apple, but the Windows maker has gained some   ground, and its media events now also contain surprises, like the   SurfaceBook laptop.In three years, the new CEO has taken his company from one in   decline to one that has a bright future. Some moves, such as   Microsoft's growing cloud business, can also be credited to   Ballmer, but opening up the company's products to all platforms   has changed the company's trajectory by exponentially opening up   its potential audience.10 stocks we like better than MicrosoftWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

How to Trade Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock After Earnings;1/24/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading     TipsBig technology stocks are stepping on to the earnings stage   over the next couple of weeks, andMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) will be among their number. MSFT stock has acted splendidly for   the past seven months or so. But now, it's coming into a   bigger-picture area on the chart that could offer some more   headwinds.It's difficult to make risk-adjusted choices - whether in the   stock market or in life - without perspective. During a   conversation with a group of fellow traders yesterday, I was   reminded how short-term-ism is an epidemic in this industry.makeArticleAd();Everyone in this group was discussing potential breakouts or   breakdowns in this and that stock. But until I brought it up,   they ignored the fact that the broader stock market for the past   month-and-a-half has been stuck in a tight consolidation   range.In other words, if most stocks as represented by the indices   are stuck in a tight range, then any given stock is likely to do   the same, until a broader directional move takes hold.We need this type of perspective when we look at MSFT stock at   the current juncture.Specifically, Microsoft earnings are scheduled for   Thursday, Jan. 26, after the close of trading. The last time I   discussed shares of MSFT - onNov. 30, 2016- I offered that although the stock at the time was already   reaching bigger-picture technical resistance, upside toward the   $64 area into year's end looked likely.10 Stocks to Buy to Survive a ""Trumpsy-Turvy""       2017Over the ensuing three weeks, Microsoft proceeded to rally,   and on Dec. 22, it hit my $64 price target right on the nose. But   shares have been consolidating in a sideways pattern ever   since.MSFT Stock ChartsLooking at the weekly chart, we see that the year-end rally in   MSFT stock pushed it right to the very upper end of a multiyear   uptrending channel that I marked with the purple-dotted   parallels.Click to EnlargeAt the same time, the stock's momentum oscillators - such as   the MACD at the bottom of this weekly chart - remain stretched on   the upside.To be clear, this doesn't mean Microsoft stock has to correct   to the downside immediately. It just means the upside momentum   here likely will be capped.On the daily chart, note that since last summer, MSFT shares   have traded in several well-defined consolidation patterns, each   one leading to a next leg higher.Click to EnlargeThe million-dollar question now is whether this latest   multiweek consolidation pattern (which on the above chart is   taking place at the very upper end of the longer-term uptrend)   will resolve to the upside or to the downside.Trade of the Day: Activision Blizzard, Inc.       (ATVI) Stock Looks to Rack Up GainsLuckily, traders now have well-defined levels to focus on:A break and hold above $63.50  could open upside     toward $65-$66.Alternatively, a break and hold below the 50-day simple     moving average (orange, currently around $61.60) could be the     beginning of a mean-reversion lower with a first price target     in the $56-$57 area. However, traders must respect any sharp     bearish reversal upon an initial post-earnings breakout (a     breakout fake-out move) as a stop-loss signal on longs.Like what you see?

Alibaba Earnings: BABA Crushes Wall Street's Q3 Earnings, Revenue Estimates;1/24/2017;"Alibaba announced earnings (Shutterstock photo)Shares of Alibaba (BABA) are rising more than 3% in Tuesday’s pre-market session after the company reported third quarter fiscal 2017 financial results that beat Wall Street estimates on both revenue and profits.The Chinese e-commerce giant, which posted a 54% jump in quarterly revenue, benefited from a combination of factors including higher sales during its Single's Day shopping event. And the fact that the company beat on the bottom line by a whopping 17 cents underscores the extent to which analysts misjudged how quickly founder/executive chairman Jack Ma and CEO Daniel Zhang can accelerate profit margins.makeArticleAd();In that vein, while BABA shares — already up 12% this year — are not a screaming bargain, good luck betting against it. Let’s go through the numbers.“We reported another excellent quarter, with robust revenue growth of 54%. With three quarters of the year coming in ahead of expectations, we are adjusting up our 2017 fiscal year revenue guidance from 48% to 53% year-over-year growth,” said CFO Maggie Wu in a statement.In the three months that ended December, Alibaba reported reported fiscal third-quarter profit of $2.57 billion, or $1 per share. On an adjusted basis, when taking out one-time gains and costs, earnings were $1.30 per share, which beats Thomson Reuters consensus estimates of $1.13 per share. The Hong Kong-based online retailer posted revenue of $7.67 billion, which also topped Street forecasts by about $375 million.“Our robust December quarter demonstrates the strength of the Chinese consumer and Alibaba’s ability to create value across our vast ecosystem,” CEO Daniel Zhang said.Beyond Single’s Day, the strong revenue beat was driven by the company’s emergence in the cloud, which posted a 115% year-over-year jump in revenue of RMB 1.76 billion (US $254 million). Not only is Alibaba enjoying an increase in the number of paying customers, the customers are also spending higher than usual, reflecting increased usage of services. Alibaba entered 2017 with a goal of challenging the likes of Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) for cloud dominance. In that vein, this was a solid first step.The company began reporting on each segment since the first quarter of fiscal 2017, breaking down the performances in four crucial areas. Growth its dominant core e-commerce segment continue to drive better-than-expected results. Plus, with revenue from the core e-commerce business growing 45% year over year, marking a more than the 41% jump sequentially, Alibaba — combined with its cloud growth — has tons of momentum heading into 2017 to send the share price higher. And the fact that Alibabahas friends in high placeswon’t hurt either."

Will Chuck E. Cheese's Be the Best Restaurant IPO in 2017?;1/23/2017;"We all know the place to go ""where a kid can be a kid"". However, in technology-laden 2017, do kids really want to leave the comfort of their homes to play virtual games? Pizza and arcade chain Chuck E. Cheese's has been battling this question lately, especially as home consoles and mobile gaming, with their added level of convenience, have slowed down growth and presented new competition for the arcade chain.Based in Texas, Chuck E. Cheese's is a family oriented restaurant-arcade establishment for children. It was founded in 1977 by Atari creator Nolan Bushnell, and the company now operates 522 locations with an additional 58 franchise locations in the United States and Canada. Parents take their families to the holistically advertised establishment for food and fun as their children flock to use their purchased tokens to play arcade games and earn tickets to win prizes.Private Buy OutApollo Global ManagementAPO, a leading global alternative investment manager, acquired Chuck E. Cheese's parent company, CEC Entertainment, in a private equity deal worth $1.3 billion in January of 2014. With a turnaround plan of new offerings such as free guest Wi-Fi and a new sophisticated food menu for parents, Apollo had proven to do well for CEC Entertainment; revenues in 2015 compared to 2014 rose 11% to $920 million.Increased SubstitutionsSurveys show most American children, both boys and girls, play with at-home video game consoles. This proves to be a challenge for Chuck E. Cheese's, as their revenue growth slumped in 2016. In its third quarter of fiscal 2016, total revenues grew 2.8% compared to a growth rate of 11.1% in the same quarter in 2015.Today, consoles such as the Xbox One by MicrosoftMSFThave taken the excitement of winning in virtual gaming to children's homes. Innovations and ideas such as gamer points, leader boards, and on-line play have not only made gaming more personal and comfortable, but also globally connected.With video game and virtual reality innovations on the rise, Chuck E. Cheese's finds it difficult to increasingly capture the attention of children. As a kid in the 1990's, Chuck E. Cheese's was one of my favorite places to go. Hitting a jackpot and winning physical tickets for a prize was an absolute thrill. However, I did not have the availability and technology children do now. With that in mind, will kids push their parents to seek an experience which they can already find in their living rooms?Looking ForwardCurrently, Apollo Global Management has started discussions with underwriters to take Chuck E. Cheese's parent company public. The aim is to take CEC Entertainment public in the second half of 2017, a deal which will be valued at over $1 billion including debt. Sources have yet to be named as IPO preparation is kept confidential.Right now, it's all speculation regarding a Chuck E. Cheese's IPO. If it follows in Dave & Buster'sPLAYfootsteps, the company has the possibility of outperforming the popularity of the personal gaming industry because of its utilization of interactivity. Children's preferences and attention continually shift as technology progresses. Chuck E. Cheese's taken public has the ability to do well through being an established household name, still proving growth, and shifting offerings to consumer preferences.Stocks that Aren't in the News…YetYou are invited to download the full, up-to-the-minute list of 220 Zacks Rank #1 ""Strong Buys"" free of charge.

Interesting January 2018 Stock Options for MSFT;1/23/2017;"Consistently, one of the more popular stocks people enter into theirstock options watchlistat Stock Options Channel is Microsoft Corporation (Symbol: MSFT). So this week we highlight one interesting put contract, and one interesting call contract, from the January 2018 expiration for MSFT. The put contract our YieldBoost algorithm identified as particularly interesting, is at the $50 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $1.85. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 3.7% return against the $50 commitment, or a 3.7% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this theYieldBoost).Selling a put does not give an investor access to MSFT's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. So unless Microsoft Corporation sees its shares fall 20.3% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $48.15 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $1.85 from $50), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 3.7% annualized rate of return.makeArticleAd();Worth considering, is that the annualized 3.7% figure actually exceeds the 2.5% annualized dividend paid by Microsoft Corporation by 1.2%, based on the current share price of $62.73. And yet, if an investor was to buy the stock at the going market price in order to collect the dividend, there is greater downside because the stock would have to lose 20.33% to reach the $50 strike price.Always important when discussing dividends is the fact that, in general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of Microsoft Corporation, looking at the dividend history chart for MSFT below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 2.5% annualized dividend yield.Turning to the other side of the option chain, we highlight one call contract of particular interest for the January 2018 expiration, for shareholders of Microsoft Corporation (Symbol: MSFT) looking to boost their income beyond the stock's 2.5% annualized dividend yield. Selling the covered call at the $72.50 strike and collecting the premium based on the $1.60 bid, annualizes to an additional 2.6% rate of return against the current stock price (this is what we at Stock Options Channel refer to as theYieldBoost), for a total of 5.1% annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away. Any upside above $72.50 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away, but MSFT shares would have to advance 15.5% from current levels for that to occur, meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called, the shareholder has earned a 18.1% return from this trading level, in addition to any dividends collected before the stock was called.The chart below shows the trailing twelve month trading history for Microsoft Corporation, highlighting in green where the $50 strike is located relative to that history, and highlighting the $72.50 strike in red:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the January 2018 put or call options highlighted in this article deliver a rate of return that represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Microsoft Corporation (considering the last 251 trading dayMSFT historical stock pricesusing closing values, as well as today's price of $62.73) to be 21%.In mid-afternoon trading on Monday, the put volume among S&P 500 components was 1.12M contracts, with call volume at 1.12M, for a put:call ratio of 0.72 so far for the day, which is above normal compared to the long-term median put:call ratio of .65. In other words, if we look at the number of call buyers and then use the long-term median to project the number of put buyers we'd expect to see, we're actually seeing more put buyers than expected out there inoptions tradingso far today.Find out which 15 call and put options traders are talking about today.Top YieldBoost MSFT Calls »"

QuoteWhat is Driving the Better-than-Expected Earnings?We note that Microsoft has posted positive earnings surprise of 10.55% in the trailing four quarters. Moreover, shares have outperformed the ZacksComputer Softwareindustry in the past six months. While the industry has posted returns of 6.5%,Microsoft sharesgained 10.6% during the period.Microsoft is benefitting from its hybrid and hyperscale cloud, which spans multiple jurisdictions, making it ideal for multinational companies and banks that have operations worldwide and are required to be in compliance with laws of the countries in which they operate.Microsoft cites this as the primary reason behind drawing 80% of the world's largest banks to Azure. Moreover, the company's expanding cloud services have also helped it to capture big customers like Boeing, Rolls-Royce, Schneider Electric and Facebook.Microsoft continues to expand its data center footprint. During the quarter, the company announced its plan to build data centers in France so as to provide Azure, Dynamics 365 and Office 365 services to the French populace by the beginning of 2017.The expansion will help Microsoft to compete Amazon.comAMZN, which also intends to open an Amazon Web Services (AWS) Region in Paris in 2017. Moreover, strategic partnerships with the likes of Adobe have aided revenue growth of its cloud based products.Further, we note that although worldwide IT spending declined in 2016, the rate of decline (0.6%) was much lower than previously expected. This also aided Microsoft's top-line growth.Additionally, IT spending is forecasted to improve in 2017, with spending across data center systems segment forecasted to rise 2.6% and touch $175 billion, mainly driven by an anticipated rise of 5.6% in the global server market. This is significantly positive for Microsoft, in our view.Microsoft is also rapidly expanding its presence in the fast emerging Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) market as is evident from the recent acquisition of Maluuba, an expert in the field of deep learning and reinforcement learning for question-answering and decision-making systems. Further, the company is gradually shifting its focus from being an operating system provider for automakers to run their in-car information and entertainment systems. All these initiatives are positive for the company in our view.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other companies you may consider as our proven model shows they too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Applied OptoelectronicsAAOI, with an Earnings ESP of +15.87% and a Zacks Rank #1.Applied MaterialsAMAT, with an Earnings ESP of +6.06% and a Zacks Rank #1.Read our Video Article on Tech Earnings Preview Here:Will AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, and AMZN Beat This   Quarter?Zacks' Top Investment Ideas for Long-Term ProfitHow would you like to see our best recommendations to help you find today's most promising long-term stocks?

Samsung (SSNLF): TWO Different Battery Failures on Galaxy Note 7;1/23/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSamsung Electronic(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) held a press conference this weekend that was buried by coverage of the U.S. presidential inauguration and the Women's March on Washington. The company announced the final results of its Galaxy Note 7 investigation, and according to Samsung, there was not one buttwoseparate Galaxy Note 7 battery flaws to blame.Source:Sylwia Bartyzel Via UnsplashThe second was introduced in the replacement battery after the initial issue was discovered.makeArticleAd();Samsung's Galaxy Note 7 Testing MarathonIt was pretty obvious once Galaxy Note 7s started bursting into flames that the battery was involved. But when the problems continued with replacement smartphones using a new battery from a different supplier, suddenly the root cause got murkier.At thepress conference, Samsung explained just how deeply it investigated the Galaxy Note 7.10 Blue-Chip Stocks That Could Be Holding You     BackEverything from the new USB-C port, to wireless charging and even software overload was closely studied and eliminated as a factor. So was Samsung's manufacturing process. The company built four test facilities (one at each site where it assembled the doomed smartphone) and put 700 engineers to work testing 200,000 Galaxy Note 7s plus 30,000 Galaxy Note 7 battery packs on their own. External testers from three different firms were also added to the teams.Exploding Galaxy Note 7 Battery Cause: Almost UnbelievableThe result?It turns out that SSNLF got hit by an almost unbelievable coincidence.In its rush to take advantage of the expected low-keyApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone 7 launch, it used a battery sourced from an unnamed supplier, that had a hidden design flaw. The battery lacked sufficient space to expand and contract - as batteries do - when charging and discharging. As a result, the battery's electrodes could touch, then short circuit. This issue was not caught by the battery manufacturer.Samsung pointed out that for its own quality assurance team to have noticed the problem, they would have had to X-Ray the batteries.Batteries from a second supplier (also un-named) used in some Galaxy Note 7s were fine. They became the go-to replacement batteries once the first wave of trouble began. However, Samsung then pushed that second supplier to dramatically increase its Galaxy Note 7 battery production volume.The demand to quickly churn out 10 million batteries overwhelmed that company's production capability and manufacturing defects crept in. A faulty internal weld could cause these replacement batteries to also short circuit and again, the defect was not visible.Samsung's Safety Pledge and the Galaxy S8Samsung took full responsibility for the Galaxy Note 7 battery fiasco, admitting that it had pushed suppliers and the limits of the manufacturing process.Going forward, the company is implementing an8-point battery safety checkthat includes accelerated usage testing, durability tests, X-Ray examination and physically disassembling the batteries.In recognition that lithium-ion batteries can be extremely volatile, Samsung has also committed to leaving more space around the battery packs in its smartphones going forward. While this runs contrary to the ""thinner at all cost"" mentality that Samsung and Apple have been pursuing, additional buffer space will protect the battery from impacts.In aninterview with Recode, Samsung's mobile division head said: ""I wish [that] this serves as an opportunity to improve safety of lithium-ion not only for Samsung but for the entire industry.""Samsung also made it clear that the Galaxy S8 - due for release this spring - will be covered by the enhanced battery safety procedures.Bank of America Corp's (BAC) Irrational     Exuberance Will EndThat Galaxy S8 launch will be the critical test of whether SSNLF truly recovers from the Galaxy Note 7 battery fiasco. The chapter is estimated to havecost the company $10 billion, Samsung stock took a hit (although strong performance by its chips division more than made up for that) and its brand was damaged.If consumers accept Samsung's findings, apology and pledge to prevent this from happening in the future, the Galaxy S8 could see a sales rebound. If the Galaxy Note 7 battery episode still surrounds the company, Apple's iPhone 8 stands a chance of clawing back share from Android when it launches in the fall and the Samsung's place on top of the Android pyramid could ultimately be in doubt.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in   any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceApple Inc.

Juniper (JNPR) Q4 Earnings: What's in the Cards this Time?;1/23/2017;"Juniper Networks, Inc.JNPRis set to release fourth-quarter 2016 earnings on Jan 26. In the last quarter, the company reported a positive earnings surprise of 14.63%. We note that the company has delivered positive earnings surprises in three of the last four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 3.09%.We also note that shares of Juniper have outperformed the ZacksWireless Equipmentindustry over the last one year. While the industry lost 6%, the stock gained 4.7%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderJuniper is a leading provider of networking solutions and communication devices. The company's frequent product launches, cost reduction initiatives and improving execution are encouraging. Additionally, the company's expansion into the software defined network segment is likely to strengthen its position in the networking space and have a positive impact on results in the to-be reported quarter.Moreover, contract wins from the likes of  National Credit Union Federation of Korea MASMOVIL, one of the largest mobile operators based in Spain, indicated increasing adoption of the company's technology.Additionally, the launch of carrier-grade unified security and routing for AWS Marketplace for enterprises is also positive. The new product will make it easier for enterprises to switch to the cloud. However, an uncertain global macro environment and potentially weak investment patterns among customers are the major headwinds. Moreover, stiff competition and ongoing consolidation in the telecom market might dampen results in the to-be reported quarter.Earnings Whispers?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Juniper is likely to beat earnings this quarter.

The company's offerings of the newly developed cloud services like vCloud Air and vCloud Air Network along with its offerings like NSX, AirWatch, virtual SAN, VxRail continues to aid the company.For fourth quarter 2016, the company expects the midpoint of its revenue range to be $1.990 billion and that of License revenues to be $850 million. Non-GAAP earnings per share are expected to be $1.39 at the midpoint.However, rising competition from players like MicrosoftMSFTremains a concern.VMware Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseVMware Inc.

What Lies in Store for InvenSense (INVN) in Q3 Earnings?;1/23/2017;"InvenSense, Inc.INVN, a leading provider of motion tracking devices, is expected to report third- quarter fiscal 2017 results on Jan 25. Last quarter, the company posted a negative earnings surprise of 60%.Over the last one year, the stock has outperformed the ZacksElectronics - Miscellaneous Componentsindustry. It has gained 59.32% compared to the industry's gain of 29.69%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderInvenSense reported a sequentially strong fiscal second quarter with revenues increasing 32%. Revenues however declined 29% year over year. Management issued a weak fiscal third-quarter guidance, which indicates continued poor demand in the mobile market.For fiscal third quarter, InvenSense expects total revenue in a range of $77-$83 million, representing a sequential increase of just 1% at the midpoint. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margin is likely to be 45.5%-46.5%.Non-GAAP income per share is projected in a range of breakeven to 3 cents, while GAAP loss per share is expected in a range of 12 cents to 15 cents.The high end smartphone market is likely to remain saturated. Thus, InvenSense has turned its focus on sensor-based solutions for image stabilization, navigation and Augmented Reality (AR).  The company is also diversifying into the broader industrial and automotive sensor market.With technological advancements, demand for console and portable video gaming devices, digital still and video cameras, drones, wearables, AR and VR head mounts and navigation devices is growing. InvenSense's chips target all these categories and hence should experience demand growth, in our opinion.However, increasing competition and uncertain demand patterns remain headwinds.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that InvenSense will beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positiveEarnings ESPand a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

It has gained 65.22% compared to the industry's gain of 60.56%.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Lam Research is likely to beat estimates this quarter. A stock needs to have both a positiveEarnings ESPand a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Lam Research has the right combination of two key components.Zacks ESP:Lam Research currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.46%.

You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with ourEarnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Lam Research currently carries a Zacks Rank #2, which when combined with an ESP of +0.46% make us reasonably confident of a positive surprise.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Lam Research Corp. Price and ConsensusLam Research Corp. Price, Consensus and EPS   Surprise|Lam Research Corp. QuoteWhat is Driving the Better-Than-Expected   Results?Lam Research has been improving on WFE market share significantly since 2013 and expects to continue to make gains.The company continues to see increased adoption rates of 3D NAND technology, FinFETs and multi-patterning. The company has initiated cost reduction and density scaling for 3D NAND and new memory technologies.Lam Research is likely to remain the market leader in dielectric etches as VECTOR Strata and ALTUS deposition and its Flex and Kiyo etch products are extremely successful thus far. It anticipates strong demand for leading-edge silicon in the enterprise market to continue, driven by the long-term move to the cloud, storage and networking applications.Moreover, the company is making good progress with its customer support business and anti-trust agency reviews.Last quarter, Lam Research terminated its proposed acquisition of California-based KLA-Tencor, following antitrust objections from the Justice Department. The department's antitrust division cited serious concerns over the deal as the combined company might restrict competition. Nonetheless, the fact that the company will not have to shell out a merger termination fee is a positive.However, concerns persist in the form of volatility and lower growth expectations globally, with a slow-but-steady improvement in some developed markets balancing the weakness in certain emerging economies.Per its second quarter guidance, on a non-GAAP basis, the company expects revenues of approximately $1.84 billion (+/- $75 million). Shipments are projected to be roughly $1.85 billion (+/- $75 million). Gross margin is predicted to be around 46.0% (+/-1%), while operating margin is likely to be about 25.0% (+/-1%).Stocks to ConsiderYou could consider the following stocks with a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank:Seagate Technology plcSTX, with an Earnings ESP of +1.87% and Zacks Rank #1.

We don't recommend Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or #5) going into the earnings announcement.However, eBay's surprise history has been much impressive, since the company has beaten estimates in three of the last four quarters and matched estimates on one occasion.What Happened Last QuartereBay's third-quarter earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on revenues that also beat estimates. The results were driven by continuous strong performance across Marketplace, StubHub and Classifieds. The company added 1 million active buyers in the third quarter taking the total to 165 million.What We Are WatchingLast quarter, eBay acquired Corrigon Ltd., which it expects will contribute significantly to its Marketplace platform's structured data initiative. It also closed the acquisitions of Ticket Utils and TicketbiS that are expected to improve seller tools.The company added Qualcomm, Mattel, Fender and Magic Chef to its strategic brand partner's list to attract more customers to its online properties. It rolled out curated experiences in Fashion, Home and Garden and eBay ShopBot on Facebook Messenger for a better user experience.StubHub rolled out a combined primary and secondary ticket experience for the Philadelphia 76ers, and enabled users to obtain support through a Skype chatbot. Seller hub continued to drive more engagement from consumer sellers.eBay sold most of its stake in MercadoLibre, Inc., a move that is expected to realize considerable gain on investment.Summing UpeBay's unique capabilities backed by technological improvements give it an edge over competitors.

Alphabet (GOOGL): Will it Beat Earnings Estimates in Q4?;1/23/2017;"Alphabet Inc.GOOGLwill report fourth-quarter 2016 earnings on Jan 26 after the bell.The surprise history has been decent in Alphabet's case. The company missed estimates just once in the last four quarters, that too by a small margin.Coming to the price performance, over the past one year, shares of Alphabet have been steadily treading higher. The stock has returned 12.89% compared with the Zacks categorizedInternet Servicesindustry's gain of 12.78%.What Happened in the Last Reported Quarter?Alphabet's third-quarter earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues which also grew year over year. The increase was primarily driven by the boom in Mobile Search, with the ongoing strength in YouTube. Also, strength in programmatic advertising and Play aided revenue growth. Other Bets revenues remained lumpy.Factors at Play in Q4The main drivers of the Google business haven't changed. Pricing remains under pressure, both on account of the ongoing FX concerns as well as continued strength in mobile and TrueView. Volumes are however encouraging as total paid click growth was a reassuring 33% last quarter.Google has gained strength in the mobile platform. Management is focused on driving mobile experiences and the company is well positioned to pick up strong intent-to-buy signals as a result of studying mobile searches from its huge database. As a result, revenue from mobile platform is expected to increase in the upcoming results.YouTube remains a strong contributor benefiting from the increase in online video consumption. More than a thousand creators are currently engaged with the platform, bringing in a thousand subscribers every day.Also, Google has turned more aggressive toward the commercialization of its self-driving cars. It aims to expand its revenues from this segment in the upcoming release. However, the current regulatory environment doesn't support fully automated cars, so there could be some problems on their part.Google's cloud business trails Amazon's AWS, Microsoft's Azure and IBM. The company's cloud business is expected to well in the to-be reported quarter. And finally, Google platforms like Android, Chrome and Daydream continue to help it draw more users and sell more ads.On a cautionary note, Google's troubles in the EU are mounting and despite its attempts to appease authorities by investing in the region, the region may prove much more expensive for it. Google is not providing for this outflow, which could mean that it still has a reasonable chance to come out victorious. But the developments are worth keeping an eye on as these are the main reasons for the overhang on the company's shares.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not show that Alphabet will beat on earnings this third quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positiveEarnings ESPand a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

Will Ericsson (ERIC) Disappoint Again in Q4 Earnings?;1/23/2017;"Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson(publ)ERICis set to report fourth-quarter and full year 2016 results on Jan 26.Last quarter, the company posted the third consecutive earnings miss, recording a negative surprise of 55.6%. Ericsson has an average negative surprise of 23.0% for the trailing four quarters, clocking only one beat.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors Influencing this QuarterOver the past one year, soft mobile broadband demand and slowdown in emerging markets have significantly dented sales. Challenging macroeconomic conditions in the emerging nations have acted as a deterrent for major investments by telecom equipment behemoths. Among its markets, Europe has been hit the worst, marring the company's prospects.Also, Ericsson's mobile broadband sales continue to be affected by adverse industry trends. During the third-quarter results, the company expressed concerns regarding renewing an important ""managed services contract"" in North America with reduced scope, thus signaling at bleak prospects. In addition, a decline in both mobile broadband coverage and capacity sales are expected to dent the top and the bottom line to a great extent.Ericsson Price and EPS SurpriseEricsson Price and EPS Surprise|Ericsson QuoteIn addition, the benefits from the cost-cutting initiatives of the company are slower than expected. Ericsson has been witnessing high restructuring charges that are proving to be a drag on financials. In relation to job reduction in Sweden, Ericsson raised its 2016 restructuring charge estimates for 2016 to SEK 5.5-6.5 billion from SEK 4-5 billion.Higher restructuring charges will likely translate into increased operating expenses for the soon-to-be-reported quarter. We believe Ericsson's savings plans and job reductions are not an adequate measure to counter the steep decline in demand.Despite these challenges, Ericsson is the world's largest supplier of LTE technology with a significant market share and has established a large number of LTE networks worldwide. During the fourth quarter, the company was selected by Turkcell to manage and operate its mobile and fiberoptic fixed networks. In addition, the company clinched two European Commission funded projects as part of the Horizon 2020 Programme.Also, the company's broadcasting and media industry business has managed to rake in significant revenues. During the fourth quarter, the division won a multi-year feature film deal from 20thCentury Fox Television Distribution along with a media delivery services contract from Australian public service broadcaster, Special Broadcasting Service (SBS). We believe these contracts will help the company counter the near-term challenges and boost its top line to some extent.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Ericsson is likely to beat the estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positiveEarnings ESPand a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

Qualcomm (QCOM) Faces $1B Patent Royalty Suit from Apple;1/23/2017;"Qualcomm Inc.QCOM, the largest mobile chipset manufacturer using baseband technology globally, has recently been pressed with a $1 billion lawsuit related to licensing royalty payments by tech giant Apple Inc.AAPL. In the lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California, Apple has accused Qualcomm of overcharging for chips and refusing to pay some $1 billion in promised rebates.Notably, just a couple of days before filing of Apple's lawsuit, Qualcomm had faced an anti-trust lawsuit from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC). The regulator filed a lawsuit with the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California claiming that the company has used anticompetitive measures to maintain a monopoly in baseband chipset market.The FTC said Qualcomm had established an exclusivity agreement with iPhone and iPAD maker Apple from 2011 to 2016. Through this deal the San Diego-based chipmaker provided billions of dollars in license rebates to Apple subject to the condition that Apple would not use chipset of Qualcomm's rival companies. The company recognized that any competitor that won Apple's business would become stronger, and used exclusivity of the deal to prevent the latter from working with and improving the effectiveness of its competitors.However, Qualcomm argued that the FTC's complaint is based on ""flawed legal theory, a lack of economic support and significant misconceptions about the mobile technology industry"". While the chipset maker observes major flaws in the accusations, it is likely get a full hearing. In the last five trading days, the stock price of Qualcomm has declined 5.34% on Nasdaq.The FTC alleged that Qualcomm has barred competitors from getting a foothold in the baseband chipset market by using unfair means to secure business, thereby harming consumer choice. Notably, Intel Corp.INTCand Media Tek are closest competitors of Qualcomm in this field. In addition to iOS, Qualcomm chipsets are vastly used for Alphabet Inc.'sGOOGLGoogle developed Android software and Microsoft Corp.MSFTdeveloped Windows operating system.Qualcomm generates approximately 29% of its total revenue from the licensing business however, this business accounts for almost 77% of the company's net profit. Moreover, the company has a history of facing allegations related to licensing disputes. The US regulator is latest in the line of accusers alleging Qualcomm of abusing its dominant position and imposing unfair licensing terms.In 2015, the Chinese regulatory authority, National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) fined Qualcomm nearly $975 million for abusing China's anti-competitive terms. In Dec 2016, the company was fined nearly $886 million in South Korea for restrictive licensing practices. Moreover, since 2011, Qualcomm has been under investigation for competition violations in the European Union region.In its filing, Apple has accused Qualcomm of pressurizing the company in providing false statement to South Korea's antitrust regulator, the Korea Fair Trade Commission regarding the above mentioned anti-trust case in that country. Apple and Samsung Electronics are the two major customers of Qualcomm's chipsets for modems that connect phones to wireless networks. The two companies together accounted for over 40% of Qualcomm's $23.5 billion in revenue in fiscal 2016 (ended in Sep 2016). Thus, a royalty lawsuit from Apple may harm Qualcomm in big way.Price Performance of QualcommIn the last one year, the stock price of Qualcomm has gained a substantial 32.16% compared with 5.97% loss witnessed by the Zacks categorizedWireless Equipmentindustry. Qualcomm, the undisputed leader in the global wireless baseband chipset market is widening its presence in adjacent opportunities, including automotive, networking, and mobile computing strategies which bode well for long-term growth. Qualcomm's Snapdragon processor is best known for its versatility in IoT applications.However, aggressive competition in the mobile phone chipset market, stringent regulatory norms and anti-competitive charges are some of the major headwinds faced by the company. We believe that these are the reasons behind the company's currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

3 Stocks That Are Up 20% in January;1/22/2017;"The S&P 500 has risen less than 1% since the beginning of   the year, but plenty of stocks posted double-digit gains during   that time. Let's take a closer look at three stocks that have   rallied about 20% in January --Shopify(NYSE: SHOP) ,Box(NYSE: BOX) , andWorkday(NYSE: WDAY) -- and see if they can continue rising through the   rest of the year.Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();ShopifyShopify provides a cloud-based e-commerce platform for small   to medium-sized businesses. Its software enables companies to   design, set up, and run their own online stores, and lets them   accept credit cards, view incoming orders, and review completed   transactions.Shopify's 18% rally in January is a continuation of its 150%   rally over the past 12 months. That rally can be attributed to   its impressive top-line growth -- its revenue surged 89%   annually, to $99.6 million last  quarter, following four   straight quarters of 90%+ growth.Shopify served over 325,000 merchants at the end of last   quarter, which was a big jump from its customer base of ""over   200,000"" merchants in the prior-year quarter, and its gross   merchandise volume doubled to $3.8 million. It also announced   deeper integration withAmazon's sales channel earlier this month, making it easier for its   customers to sell products on  the e-commerce giant's   marketplace.Analysts expect Shopify's revenue to rise 86% for the   full year, but it still isn't profitable yet on a GAAP or   non-GAAP basis. Its GAAP loss widened last quarter, mainly due to   higher stock-based compensation expenses, but its non-GAAP loss   slightly narrowed. Shopify is a pretty pricey stock at 13 times   sales, but its growth trajectory might support that   valuation.BoxBox provides online file sharing and personal cloud content   for businesses. The company faces tough challenges in the   cloud-storage market from Dropbox and bigger tech giants, but its   customer base already includes massive companies likeGeneral ElectricandSymantec.Like Shopify, Box has great top-line growth and weak   bottom-line growth. Its revenue rose 31% annually, to $102.8   million last quarter, as billings rose 26%. Deferred revenue, a   key indicator of future demand, jumped 36%, to $192.6 million.   Box's quarterly revenues have now risen by more than 30% annually   for the past five quarters, and analysts anticipate 31% sales   growth this year. Box is unprofitable by both GAAP and non-GAAP   metrics, but its losses are narrowing by both measures.Image source: Getty Images.Box has rallied 23% in January, but still trades at six times   sales, which is only slightly higher than the industry average of   four for  application-software companies. But looking ahead,   Box and Dropbox both face very tough competition in the   cloud-storage market.Companies likeMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) are offering plenty of free and cheap storage to   enterprise customers to tether them to their cloud ecosystems.   Despite that competition, Microsoft has integrated Box into   Office 365, sparking rumors of an eventual takeover. With an   enterprise value of just over $2 billion, Box could certainly be   a lucrative target in a consolidation of the cloud-storage   market.WorkdayWorkday provides enterprise cloud applications that help   companies staff, pay, and organize their workforces. They also   utilize analytics and machine learning to help companies make   financial and workforce-related decisions.Demand for these services has been robust -- Workday's sales   rose 34% annually last quarter and have risen 30% to 40% over the   past four quarters. Analysts expect its revenue to rise 35% this   year, although the company warned in early January that a few of   its bigger deals had been delayed by global uncertainties   regarding Brexit, the U.S. presidential election, and other G8   country elections.But like Shopify and Box, Workday has weak profitability.   That's because the cost of securing new customers coupled with   price competition and the low margins of the cloud SaaS (software   as a service) market make it tough to squeeze out a profit, even   with double-digit sales growth. Workday squeezed out a narrow   non-GAAP profit last quarter, but its GAAP earnings remain deep   in the red. Its price-to-sales ratio of 11 also looks pricey   relative to its software-industry peers.However, Workday stockrecently ralliedafterWal-Mart(NYSE: WMT) subscribed to its Human Capital Management,   Recruiting, Learning, and Planning products. That dealmightadd $100 million to $200 million to Workday's annual revenues   (5%-10% of its projected revenues for next year), according to   Drexel Hamilton analyst Brian White -- but Wal-Mart didn't   disclose how many of its 2 million+ employees would actually use   the system. Nonetheless, that rally lifted Workday stock 24% in   January.Should you buy these stocks?Shopify, Box, and Workday are all fairly high-risk growth   stocks. I believe that Box's lower valuation and buyout potential   make it the ""safest"" stock on this list, while Shopify's   incredible top-line growth makes it the best growth play. Workday   is also a good growth play, but its weak profitability and high   valuations make it a risky bet for a frothy market.Find out why Workdayis one of the 10 best stocks to buy nowMotley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent     more than a decade beating the market.

Why Himax Technologies Is Not a Top Stock to Buy Now;1/22/2017;"Image source: Getty Images.Himax Technologies(NASDAQ: HIMX) may seem poised to benefit from the potential   growth of augmented reality (AR), but there's one major hurdle   the company will have to overcome before that happens: AR devices   are too expensive for the mass market right now.makeArticleAd();This challenge can be overcome -- after all, we're still at   the beginning stages of AR's growth. But as a component maker,   Himax relies on mass adoption to be able to scale its AR   component production. With device prices so high, and adoption   rates so low, Himax may not be a top stock to buy right now.AR is still too expensive for consumersNorthland Capital Markets' Tom Sepenzis wrote in a recent   investor note (republishedonBarron's):Augmented reality remains the largest potential for HIMX     with its LCOS and WLO products, but the market has hit another     stumbling block as prices remain prohibitive for consumers. We     believe that this will limit the number of new AR devices for     the next 12-24 months....He's referring to Himax's liquid crystals on   silicon (LCOS) and wafer-level optics (WLO) products   that the company is ramping up this year, with plans tobring new production online late this yearor in early 2018. Himax says that it works with 30 augmented   reality device makers right now, and believes that it's at ""the   beginning of a very long-term growth story"" for AR.The problem is that some AR devices, suchMicrosoft's HoloLens (which Himax is a supplier for), cost $3,000. To be   fair, the current version of HoloLens is for developers. But at   $3,000, AR devices are still a very long way from becoming a   Saturday afternoon purchase for most consumers.A Bloomberg article fromlast yearsaid it could take four to five years for AR and virtual reality   (VR) headsets and other technologies to reach mainstream   adoption, and that price will be one of the main factors in   determining when they take off.A bit too earlyIt's hard to get passed the idea that Himax's AR potential may   still be a little too far off. Sure, the company is bringing new   production lines online to prepare for possible AR component   growth, but AR's viability is not a sure thing.It can be a great thing for investors to find a company that's   betting on a new market that's poised for growth, but there   appears to be too many unknowns for Himax. First, investors will   be waiting until the end of this year, or the beginning of 2018,   to see the company's LCOS and WLO production ramp up. If AR was a   sure-thing, then sitting patiently for that to come to fruition   would be easier to stomach. As it stands, AR is still in its   nascent stages.Second, component makers like Himax can easily getting burned   in situations like this, where the need to score big design wins   from tech makers can take precedence over earning solid margins   and strong revenues. Himax CEO Jordan Wu indicated on the   November earnings call that its AR component sales were falling   because just one ""major customer"" was pulling back on demand:We therefore expect our LCOS and WLO sales to decline in the     fourth quarter, as well as over the next few quarters in 2017.     We are not particularly worried about the short-term headwind     as the said major customer is more committed than ever in the     long-term development of the AR product concept, which is     viewed as a new computing platform and that Himax remains a     critical partner to the customer in these AR efforts.Himax might be on the right path, but the company's reliance   one just one key customer for AR sales -- and current AR device   prices being too high -- make me perfectly comfortable staying   away from the stock right now.10 stocks we like better than Himax     TechnologiesWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

3 Things to Watch in the Stock Market This Week;1/22/2017;"Stocks ticked lower last week, but remain up slightly through   the first few weeks of 2017. TheDow Jones Industrial Average(DJINDICES: ^DJI)  and theS&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC)  each remain near all-time highs as   investors brace for an avalanche of quarterly earnings reports   over the coming weeks.^SPXdata byYCharts.makeArticleAd();Hundreds of companies are set to post results for the final   quarter of 2016 this week. A few of the most anticipated reports   includeStarbucks(NASDAQ: SBUX) ,McDonald's(NYSE: MCD) andMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) .McDonald's sales growthFast-food giant McDonald's starts the week off for investors   with fourth-quarter results due out on Monday morning. After a   disappointing two-year stretch, the restaurant chain is on a   winning streak of five straight quarters of comparable-store   sales growth, including a 6% spike early in 2016.The company's latest report wasn't as impressive, but global   comps still accelerated to a 3.5% pace from the prior quarter's   3.1% uptick due to continued help from its all-day breakfast   shift and a popular McPick 2 value platform. Growth might be   harder to come by this quarter given the overall weak selling   environment in the fast-food industry.Shareholders will likely hear updated thinking from management   on industry trends and how they plan to keep improving the guest   experience through menu additions and store remodels. On the   financial side, McDonald's will complete most of its   refranchising plan in 2017, which should raise significant funds   for reinvesting in the business and returning cash to   shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks.Starbucks' customer trafficStarbucks kicks off its 2017 fiscal year with results due outafter the market closeson Thursday. The coffee titan has seen its traffic gains slow   recently, with transactions rising 2% in the past year following   a 3% bump in the prior period. Beverage innovations and increased   food sales helped average customer spending jump higher. However,   the traffic decline muted overall gains.Image source: Starbucks.The coffee chain will need steady transaction growth to hit   its long-term expansion plans. Executives believe they can boost   earnings by between 15% and 20% each year through 2021 as   Starbucks adds 12,000 stores to its base and increases sales at   existing locations by about 5% annually. ""I have never been more   energized or optimistic about the opportunities ahead,"" CEO   Howard Shultz said in early December as he discussed handing over   his leadership role to Chief Operating Officer Kevin Johnson.Investors will be looking for evidence this week that these   ambitious targets are achievable through initiatives like mobile   ordering, global expansion, and a deeper push into the retailing   world .Microsoft's cloud revenueMicrosoft is coming off astrong 2016that saw the stock finally surpass the all-time high it posted   during the dot-com bubble era in late 1999. Investors sent shares   higher, thanks to the success of its cloud business, which has   been helped along by a doubling of Azure revenue. In Mr. Softy's   most-recent quarter, growth in that segment helped offset a   decline in the company's personal computing (PC) division, which   was driven by continued weakness in the PC market.Image source: Microsoft.Consensus estimates call for a 2% sales decline and flat   earnings when Microsoft posts results on Thursday. CEO Satya   Nadella is likely to focus his management comments on high-growth   cloud services, including an Azure offering that the company aims   to grow into a $20 billion business by fiscal 2018.""The cloud is winning significant customer support,"" Nadella   said following Microsoft's blockbuster July quarterly report. The   key question for the company going forward is whether those   growth engines will ramp up quickly enough to offset declines in   legacy business like PC software and video gaming.Find out why Starbucksis one of the 10 best stocks to buy nowMotley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent     more than a decade beating the market.

Has Toymaker Mattel Beaten Netgear With This New High-Tech Device?;1/21/2017;"When it comes to high-tech gadgetry, you'd think networking   hardware specialistNetgear(NASDAQ: NTGR) would have a commanding lead over toymakerMattel(NASDAQ: MAT) , but while both companies are branching out in new   directions, where they're intersecting may actually have Barbie's   parent in the lead.Even baby monitors have gone high-tech from their humble   walkie-talkie beginnings. Image source: Joris via Wikimedia   Commons.makeArticleAd();Baby monitors have come a long way from the walkie-talkie-type   devices that let you listen in on the coos and cries of your   infant. Today they're part of the Internet of Things in a   connected home that let you wirelessly watch your child on your   computer, laptop, or smartphone whether you're at home, outside,   or away. Yet for all their tech wizardry, they're really little   more than remote viewers, which is why the surprising new   developments from Mattel and Netgear are so innovative. They lift   the baby monitor out of being just a static device that watches   and listens and turn it into something that is interactive.Security outside the home, and in the nurseryNetgear's Arlo Baby is a natural progression from its Arlo and   Arlo Q home security cameras that it acquired back in 2012, which   were marketed at the time under the VueZone brand. After   significantly upgrading the hardware and networking capabilities,   they were rebranded as Arlo and won industry plaudits. So it's   really not such a stretch for Netgear to go from helping you   watch your house and possessions to keeping an eye on your   baby.Image source: Arlo.Shaped like a rabbit -- a small, Cyclops-like rabbit -- the   Arlo Baby offers parents two-way talk and listen capabilities,   night vision, and 1080p video. That's not much more than what   you'll find on existing baby monitors on the market like the   Summer Infant Baby Link camera or TrendNet's WiFi Baby Cam, and   even its preloaded lullabies and ability to play your own music   can be found on devices like the iBaby Monitor M6S. Its   sensors monitor temperature, humidity, and air quality levels in   the nursery as well as provide alerts when the baby moves,   similar to features found on thePhilipsIn.Sight monitor.Where Netgear's device improves on existing monitors is   combining them all into one product and then adding a few   upgrades such as the ability to distinguish between a baby's cry   and other sounds an infant might make, and note it in its audio   alerts. It also records movement and sound and stores the clips   in the cloud, allowing you to download them for free for seven   days, and allows for expansion with five additional cameras being   added for free, and up to 15 cameras total.Technology doesn't come cheap, though, as an Arlo Baby will   set you back around $250, or $300 if you add a dedicated 7-inch   LCD viewer to it. Other accessories, including cat and Dalmatian   designs, are also available.This is definitely not a toyMore remarkable, however, may be what Mattel has achieved with   its Aristotle by Nabi baby monitor. Essentially performing all of   the same tasks as Netgear's Arlo, the toymaker's device is no   toy.Mattel entered the market in a roundabout way, acquiring last   year for $21.5 million the bankrupt company Fuhu, which made the   popular Nabi children's tablet. It unveiled the Aristotle at this   year's Consumer Electronics Show, and though it will cost $299   when it becomes available this summer, it offers what appears to   be superior functionality over the Arlo and other devices on the   market.Image source: Microsoft.Beyond the capabilities found elsewhere, the system is billed   as the first artificially intelligent smart assistant for kids.   Essentially anAmazonEcho or Google Home, the Aristotle device usesMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) programming andQualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM) processors to recognize your child's voice   patterns, and as the child grows, it becomes more interactive. It   can read stories, help a child learn the alphabet, and using   Microsoft's Bing search engine, it can help a child search for   answers to homework assignments.Furthermore, Mattel has partnered with retailers likeTargetand Babies 'R' Us to take advantage of its ability to take note   of nap and diaper change times, and to speed up orders of baby   supplies that may be running low, like diapers or formula. It   sees the device also becoming connected with other toys for a   greater immersive play experience as well as partnering with   other companies for additional capabilities.Considering the opportunity for this ""baby monitor"" to develop   into something much more than simply a static device to watch,   listen, and monitor, as well as to last beyond a child's infancy,   it would seem Mattel has jumped well ahead of Netgear and other   companies trying to compete for a share of the playroom.10 stocks we like better than MattelWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

Let's Make Earnings Season Important Again;1/21/2017;"Now that we officially have a new President and the market has broken its losing streak, it's time to direct our focus back to earnings season. So far, Donald Trump has been completely overshadowing the reports, but that should change next week when the season really kicks into gear.makeArticleAd();As Steve said in today'sRTA:""keep an even keel in your reaction to each individual report. Don't get too upset if it goes against us…don't get too elated if we seem to have a non-stop string of winners. This state of mind will help us navigate the often turbulent waters of earnings season to get to desired shores of higher profits"".It was a challenging week for the market but it ended on a high note as the Dow broke its five session losing streak with an advance of 0.48% to 19,827.3. The S&P was up 0.34% to 2271.3 and the NASDAQ increased 0.28% to 5555.33. The market reacted much better on the first day of Trump's presidency then Obama's, but we must remember that the now former president came to power during the Great Recession. President Trump has been bequeathed a growing economy and low unemployment, so it will be interesting to see what he can do with that.The portfolios saw a couple big winners on Friday.Options Traderdecided to remove one of its spreads ahead of its quarterly report, which brought the portfolio a triple-digit return.Surprise Traderhad its second consecutive double-digit winner from the same stock, and also bought today. Learn more about these moves below, along with some excerpts from other portfolios.Triple-Digit Winner for Options Trader→ TheOptions Trader's bull call spread in State Street (STT) is fully in-the-money, but the stock has dropped in the past few days. With earnings scheduled for next week, Kevin thought this would be a good time to remove the spread and take a nice return of 104%. Therefore, he sold to the close the Feb. 70.00 Call AND bought to close the Feb. 75.00 Call.→ TheSurprise Tradermade a big double-digit profit yesterday as shares of CSX (CSX) soared. But the stock pulled back on Friday a bit more dramatically than Eric was expecting. So the editor sold the second half of the position to secure a double-digit return of 13.8%.Today's Portfolio Highlights:• Microsoft (MSFT) has been pretty impressive at earnings season of late with two straight quarters of double-digit beats. Eric is hoping for more of the same when this tech giant reports again after the bell on Thursday. The company has amassed an average surprise of 10% over the past four quarters and has a positive Earnings ESP heading into next week, so it appears set for another solid performance. The stock is also a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) with a Zacks VGM Score of ""A"". For all these reasons, MSFT was added toSurprise Traderon Friday with a 12.5% allocation.• ""The inauguration is over and the market chopped around again, much too many traders dismay. Trump was sworn in and gave a populist speech that caused modest selling. However, markets came right back with the S&P finishing up 0.34% and the Nasdaq closing 0.28% higher.""I talk to a highly skilled trader on instant messenger all day and it was interesting getting his perspective this week. In his words ""This is the strongest weakest marker ever"". I agree, there seems to be so much energy building up to shoot higher, but it just can't seem to go. Something is holding it back, whether it's a manipulation, foreign selling, democrats selling or whatever you want to dream up.""When the selling is done, you really have to wonder if there will be anything left to hold the market back, or if we just explode up like a rubber band being stretched too far. We will find out shortly,""said Jeremy inZacks Counterstrike.• ""The Trump economy officially kicked off today as Donald J Trump was sworn in as the 45th President of the United States of America. The volatility that traders had murmured about through the course of the week simply did not show up. Stocks ended on a strong note and the bulls were back in charge. Earnings season ended its first big week without any huge disappointments and now we're set up for a pretty good January so far.""It looks like smooth sailing on the horizon for the market in the early part of earnings season here. Next week there is a huge emphasis on tech with a lot of big names reporting. Should make for some volatility on the NASDAQ and could be fuel to push the S&P 500 on through to new highs,""said Dave inMomentum Trader.Have a Great Weekend,Jim GiaquintoRecommendations from Zacks' Private Portfolios:Believe it or not, this article is not available on the Zacks.com website.

Nokia's New Phone Sells Out in a Minute -- But What Does That Mean?;1/20/2017;"Nokia's(NYSE: NOK) new Android phone, the  Nokia 6, reportedly   sold out within the first minute on its launch day in China. The   device was offered briefly in an online flash sale, although   Nokia didn't disclose how many units were actually offered.   However, over a million people reportedly registered for the   flash sale.The Nokia 6. Image source: Nokia.makeArticleAd();The Nokia 6 is a mid-range device which sports a Snapdragon   430 chipset, 4GB of RAM, a 16-megapixel rear camera, 8-megapixel   front camera, a 3,000 mAh battery, and a 5.5"" screen. The device,   which is only available in China for now, costs  around $245   and runs Android 7.0 out of the box.Those specs don't sound too impressive, but the device marks   Nokia's long-awaited return to the smartphone market. But before   investors start thinking that this is the start of Nokia's   comeback, they should understand that Nokia's smartphone business   changed considerably after it sold its handset unit toMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) back in 2014.The evolution of Nokia's smartphone businessAfter Nokia sold its handset unit to Microsoft, it signed a   non-compete agreement with Microsoft which barred it from selling   new mobile devices until the  end of 2016. During the   following two years, Microsoft dropped the Nokia branding from   its Lumia devices, and tried using them to grow Windows Phone's   market share against iOS and Android. That effort flopped, and   Windows Phone now  controls less than 1% of the smartphone   market. Admitting defeat, Microsoft took a $7.6 billion writedown   on the unit, laid off most of the handset unit, and reduced the   number of annual Lumia launches.During that time, Nokia formed a new business unit called   Nokia Technologies, which housed its patent portfolio and   developed experimental new products like the Ozo VR camera. Nokia   then realized that it could license out its design, patents, and   branding to other companies that wanted to create Nokia-branded   devices. This strategy enabled Nokia to keep its brand relevant   and collect low-risk royalties without shouldering any production   costs.Nokia's N1 tablet. Image source: Nokia.Since Nokia was prohibited from launching new phones, it   licensed out its brand toFoxconnto create the N1 Android tablet for China in early 2015. Nokia   and Foxconn used a flash sale strategy for the N1, proclaiming   that  the device sold out ""within minutes"" each time --   although the first batch only included 20,000 units. Nokia then   realized that it could apply the same strategy to the smartphone   market once the non-compete agreement expired.The birth of HMD GlobalFor that purpose, private equity fund Smart Connect formed a   new company, led by former Nokia executives, calledHMDGloballast year. HMD obtained the exclusive global license (excluding   Japan) to create Nokia-branded phones and tablets over the next   decade, and signed a contract to exclusively source the   production of the devices to Foxconn's subsidiary FIH Mobile. HMD   and FIH Mobile also co-purchased Nokia's feature phone business   from Microsoft last May.The creation of HMD Global meant that HMD and Foxconn would   produce brand new Nokia devices while paying Nokia Technologies a   steady stream of royalties. This means that robust sales of new   Nokia handsets would benefit HMD much more than Nokia, but Nokia   would be insulated from any downside risks.But can Nokia smartphones become relevant     again?Nokia devices face a long uphill battle to becoming relevant   again in the highly saturated smartphone market. The Android   market in China is a particularly brutal one flooded with   low-margin players. EvenXiaomi, the former Chinese market leader which lost its crown toHuaweiin late 2015, admitted that it  didn't make any money from   its smartphone sales last November.Nokia's design and specs don't really stand out in the Chinese   market, so HMD is likely counting on Nokia's brand strength and   the hype of flash sales to boost demand. While the initial   reports of the Nokia 6 ""selling out"" are encouraging, the lack of   actual sales figures indicate that it's just an attempt to   generate hype like the claims of its N1 tablets ""selling out""   during its flash sales. Therefore, investors should keep an eye   on the Nokia 6's reception in China, but they shouldn't believe   that it signals a comeback for Nokia in the smartphone   market.10 stocks we like better than NokiaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Q4 Earnings Growth the Highest in 8 Quarters;1/20/2017;"makeZacksArticleAd();The Q4 earnings season has gotten off to a good start, with earnings and revenue growth tracking above other recent periods and on track to reach the highest level in 8 quarters. Positive surprises, particularly on the earnings front, are a bit on the low side relative to historical periods at this stage. We will see if this trend continues this week as we enter the heart of the earnings season, with more than 300 companies coming out with quarterly results, including 105 S&P 500 members.As of Friday, January 20th, we have seen Q4 results from 63 S&P 500 members that combined account for 19.2% of the index's total market capitalization. Total earnings for these 63 index members are up +4.7% on +2.7% higher revenues, with 66.7% beating EPS estimates and 50.8% coming ahead of top-line expectations.The table below provides the current Q4 scorecardThe charts below provide a comparison of the results thus far with what we have seen from this same group of 63 S&P 500 members in other recent periods.As you can see, the Q4 growth pace is notably tracking above what we had seen from the same group of 63 index members in other recent periods. But positive surprises (right-hand chart above) are tracking a bit on the low side at this stage, particularly on the earnings side. The 66.7% proportion of Q4 companies beating EPS estimates compares to 81% in the preceding quarter, 75% as the 4-quarter average and 71.3% as the 12-quarter average. Positive revenue surprises are tracking below what we had seen from the same group of companies in Q3, but are roughly in-line with historical periods.The chart below compares the proportion of companies reporting Q4 results that are beatingbothEPS and revenue estimates with what this same group of companies had reported in other recent periods.Trump Bump for BanksThe sample of Q4 earnings reports is heavily weighted towards the Finance sector at this stage whose improved results are helping the aggregate growth picture as well. The growth picture looks a lot less impressive once looked at on an ex-Finance basis.Total earnings for the roughly half of the Finance sector's market cap in the S&P 500 index that have reported results are up +11.8% from the same period last year on +2.6% higher revenues, with +68.2% beating EPS estimates and +45.5% beating top-line estimates.This is better growth performance than we have seen from the sector in other recent periods, as the comparison charts below show. Please note that positive surprises are as hard to come by in the Finance sector as they are elsewhere.We didn't really see the full impact of higher interest rates on the banks' net interest margins in Q4 results. But higher interest rates, increased confidence and the resultant enhanced appetite for risks did juice the trading revenues forJPMorgan(JPM),Bank of America(BAC),Goldman Sachs(GS) and evenMorgan Stanley(MS). This didn't come as a surprise to the market, as estimates and stock prices had already run up quite a bit ahead of these earnings reports. It is reasonable to expect these bank stocks to remain in a holding pattern in the coming days till fundamentals changes in a meaningful way and/or progress on legislative expectations start showing up.Key Reports for the Week of January 23rdMonday - 1/23/2017:McDonalds(MCD) andHalliburton(HAL) are the notable for the four index members reporting results today. Estimates for Zacks Rank # 1 (Strong Buy) rated Halliburton have been going up lately, reflecting the company's strong positioning in the North American oilfield region. The stock has literally been on a tear lately, up +88.9% in the past year vs. +44.2% gain for the Zacks Energy sector and +41.9% gain for peerSchlumberger(SLB) whose Q4 results failed to impress on Friday.Tuesday - 1/24/2017: We have 21 S&P 500 members reporting results today, of which 12 report before the market's open.Verizon(VZ),Johnson & Johnson(JNJ) and3M(MMM) are the notable reports, all reporting in the morning. China'sAlibaba(BABA) is also on deck to report results today.Wednesday - 1/25/2017: Of the 31 index members reporting results today (16 in the morning), the notable reports are fromBoeing(BA) andAT&T(T). Boeing shares are up +11.8% since November 8th, outperforming the Zacks Aerospace sector (up +8.9%) on hopes of ramped up defense spending from the Trump administration.Thursday - 1/26/2017: On a busy reporting day with 37 index members coming out with Q4 results (24 in the morning & 13 after the market's close), we haveAlphabet(GOOGL),Intel(INTC) andMicrosoft(MSFT) reporting results after the close. Other notable reports today includeCaterpillar(CAT) andFord(F) in the morning andStarbucks(SBUX) after the close.Estimates for Microsoft have gone up ahead of the earnings release and the stock has outperformed the broader Tech sector (up +21.5%) and Alphabet (up +13.4%) by gaining +23.4% over the past year. Starbucks has been a notable laggard over the past year, with the stock modestly in negative territory over that time period, though it has turned around a bit since early November.Friday - 1/27/2017:Chevron(CVX) andAmerican Airlines(AAL) are the notable reports today, both in the morning.Q4 Expectations As a WholeFor Q4 as a whole, total earnings for the S&P 500 companies are expected to be up +4.8% from the same period last year on +3.7% higher revenues. This would follow the +3.8% growth in Q3 earnings on +2.3% higher revenues, the first instance of positive earnings growth for the index after five quarters of back-to-back declines. Comparisons for the Energy sector, a big driver of the earnings recession, turn positive in Q4, with the sector's earnings growth turning positive for the first time after 8 quarters of declines.The chart below shows the Q3 earnings growth contrasted with declines in the preceding 5 quarters. As you can see in the chart below, the growth pace is expected to ramp up in 2017.The table below shows the summary picture Q4 contrasted with what was actually achieved in the preceding quarter.Note: Sheraz Mian heads the Zacks Equity Research department and is a well-regarded expert of aggregate earnings.

Square Inc (SQ) Stock Needs to Make Some Money;1/20/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSquare Inc.(NYSE:SQ) has never been a money-making proposition. Like many tech companies, net income has not been their thing, man.Growthhas been their thing. Revenues rose from $552 million in 2013 to $1.267 billion two years later, and that record will likely be beaten when the company next reports on Jan. 31.makeArticleAd();Source:Chris Harrison via Flickr (Modified)Analysts are expecting$451 million in revenue for the quarter, or $1.307 billion for the year. The whisper on losses, 8 cents per share, would bring total losses for the year to 46 cents. Square survives on hope and cash flow, which was slightly positive in 2015 and the third quarter of 2016. Its growth is slowing noticeably.But what if, just for fun, Square did something wild, crazy, and in-line with what the rest of the payments industry does, and made a little money for shareholders?The stock would take off. It would take off bigly.How Square Stock Might Make MoneySquare is not going to make a net profit as a processor. It's not going to bypass exchange fees. Instead it's going to become profitable as a platform, with a host of financial products attractive to its small business base.The 7 Best High-Yield Investments for RetirementAs our James Brumley wrote this weekthese include Square Capital, whose loans havedoubled over the last year. Square is also offeringpayroll services, inventory management and analyticsto its small business customers.This hope has sent SQ stock up 56% in the last six months, which sounds great until you take the chart out a few months, and see that stock hit another peak in April, 2015, which took it higher than the present price of $14.90. At that point, speculation on brighter days had pushed it to $15.13.Who Wants SQ Stock?Partly for that reason, our Tom Taulli has another reason to buy Square stock.As takeout bait.Square has a powerful brand (at least within its niche), it's big in mobile, and there are a lot of big tech companies that aren't in payments yet but might like a play there, likeMicrosoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT).That's interesting, but if SQ stock were going to be taken out, the buyer would not likely come from that quarter. Processing is something a tech company can do for itself, if it's interested in that low-margin business. There are easier ways to make money.It's more likely the buyer would come from the payments mainstream - processors likeFirst Data Corp(NYSE:FDC),PayPal Holdings Inc(NASDAQ:PYPL) andVantiv Inc(NASDAQ:VNTV). These companies understand just how complex processing merchant payments are, and what the capacity is worth. Wait a few years and maybe some banking organizations likeJP Morgan Chase & Co.(NYSE:JPM) orCapital One Financial Corp.(NYSE:COF) might come calling.A move by any of these players could set off a feeding frenzy in the industry, one that would deliver shareholders a premium well over its current $5.3 billion price.That may be why a processor isn't making such a move. SQ stock is already bigger, by market cap, thanNCR Corporation(NYSE:NCR), which has been around since the 19th century.The ancillary businesses may also be unattractive. It's hard enough just processing payments.A winning premium would also make Square unaffordable for a merchant processor outfit like Vantiv, worth $12.3 billion, and make the merchants payment outfit vulnerable to takeover by one of the banks that distribute cards and serve the customer side of the transaction. MaybeIntuit Inc.(NASDAQ:INTU) orAmerican Express Company(NYSE:AXP) might be interested in upsetting the apple cart in that way, but again you're talking about a less-profitable operation and, in the case of Intuit (worth $30.1 billion), a deal that could soak up a lot of its market cap.A SpeculationThere are many companies that could make a move on SQ stock, setting off a frenzy of merger activity in the payments space akin to what everyone keeps expecting will happen in media after Sumner Redstone dies and the sharks come forViacom, Inc.(NASDAQ:VIAB).Is the Groupon Inc (GRPN) Comeback Done for Good?But waiting for such a frenzy, betting on it with your money, is speculation. Square today is still a money-losing proposition in an industry where losing money is uncommon, and a company whose growth is slowing rapidly.Go for it if you wish, but don't hock the silver. This is a mad money play.Dana Blankenhornis a financial and technology journalist. He is the author of the sci-fi novellaInto the Cloud, available at the Amazon Kindle store.

Donald Trump Inauguration: Stocks To Buy, Sell For The Next Four Years;1/20/2017;"Donald Trump (Shutterstock photo)Donald Trump has been sworn in as the 45th president of the United States. The President-elect, who pledged to “Make America great again,” promised plenty of things he would do regarding his first day in office. From repealing and replacing Obamacare to renegotiating NAFTA and beginning the construction of the wall on the Mexican border.We won’t know for certain which of Trump’s policies will take priority or how they will be enforced. But what we do know is that for Trump to make good on his promises to bring back jobs, grow GDP and strengthen industry, he needs businesses to lead, innovate and hire workers. For that to happen, businesses leaders need to know their government is on their side. To that end, here are some names to own for the next four years (at least) as Trump’s policies take shape.makeArticleAd();Lower Corporate TaxesTrump’s promise to lower corporate taxes can have a boosting effect on the tech sector, which has an estimated $1.4 trillion stashed in overseas tax havens. These include some America's largest corporations such as Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT), which could face a huge tax hit if they bring that cash home. Not only has Trump promised to lower the business tax rate from 35% to 15%, he pledged to eliminate the corporate alternative minimum tax.Beyond lowering the tax rate, it would hardly shock anyone if Trump — given his pro-business stance — were to enact a tax holiday at some point during his presidency. Companies like Cisco (CSCO), Facebook (FB) and Alphabet (GOOGL) would thrive. They would no longer need to borrow cheap cash to fund their operations. Likewise, a better capitalized Tesla (TSLA) can accelerate the building of its Gigafactory, helping it achieve not only higher profit margins, but also higher vehicle production. In the process, Tesla would ignite the state of Nevada as an innovative hub, while mass-producing producing emission-free vehicles at affordable prices.“Repeal and Replace”The Affordable Care Act, a.k.a Obamacare was designed to — among other things — “insure the un-insurable.” Notably, to provide insurance coverage to people with pre-existing conditions who were blocked under the then-existing rules. Depending on what side of the aisle you’re on, Obamacare either did its job or was a “complete disaster,” according to Trump. Still, whether Obamacare is entirely dismantled or parts of it is kept, you don’t have to look too far beyond UnitedHealth (UNH) to find a stock can will thrive.UnitedHealth has worked aggressively to exit the Affordable Care exchanges, which reduces its  exposure to any changes Trump might make. What’s more, added from being the nation's largest health insurer, UnitedHealth owns Optum, which provides pharmacy benefit management services. Last week, not only did the company beat top- and bottom-line estimates, UnitedHealth raised its fiscal 2017 financial outlook, suggesting it is ready for whatever Trump decides to do.Not every company will be as lucky. Conversely, companies such HCA Holdings (HCA) and Universal Health Services (UHS) that prospered under Obamacare may suffer. As will government health care providers such as Centene Corporation (CNC) and Molina Healthcare, Inc. (MOH).Scale Back Dodd-FrankCutting down strict regulations imposed on financial institutions has been another policy Trump has proposed. After all, how can he achieve economic growth and strengthen small business if banks aren't lending money — something banks collectively struggled to do under Dodd-Frank. But as evidenced by the strong earnings results released so far from the likes of Bank of America (BAC), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C) and Goldman Sachs (GS), financials are once again the sector to bank on.Written to strengthen consumer protection and create tougher rules on excessive risk-taking, the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act has been cited by bank executives as a prohibiter of growth. ""There's many aspects of it that we've got to kill,"" said Steven Mnuchin, Trump's pick for Treasury secretary. Mnuchin former partner at Goldman Sachs, called Dodd-Frank ""the number one priority on the regulatory side.”To that end, I would be surprised if Trump doesn’t take to “repeal and replace” Dodd-Frank in his first 100 days in office. Combined with the prospect of higher interest rates, lower taxes it’s tough to ignore the potential upside a bank like Morgan Stanley (MS) can provide. It’s not just the big banks that will prosper, however. Keep an eye on super regionals like Comerica (CMA), US Bancorp (USB) and PNC Financial (PNC), which Trump has made great again."

Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Can’t Please Everybody;1/20/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsI have to admit straight off the bat that I'm not too fond of writing aboutApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). For starters, everyone - and I do meaneveryone- has an opinion on Apple stock.Source: AppleEven those that may be uninterested in the markets, or consumers who prefer products fromSamsung Electronic(OTCMKTS:SSNLF) orSony Corp (ADR)(NYSE:SNE), still seem to throw in their two cents. That's the power of the Apple brand.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','vanguard','','');I'm not complaining. Although I have a financial interest in SNE stock, and have owned Samsung smartphones in the past, Apple products are better. Its ecosystem is seamlessly connected, and its interface is intuitive. Best of all, the company has an uncanny ability to provide solutions for which you have yet to realize is a problem. And no - finding a good-looking, untucked dress shirt isnot a real problem!The central issue I have with Apple stock is that investors may be too emotionally vested. If there's any advice I can give, it's that business is all about the numbers. Holding any other view could lead you down a dangerous path.Positive Factors Buoying Apple StockAdmittedly, Apple stock doesn't make market agnosticism easy. The heart of the organization of course is the iPhone. Last Friday, rumors circulated that the upcoming iPhone 8 will featurebetter water resistancethan its predecessor. The improvement could potentially allow the ""8"" to survive immersion greater than one meter deep. Whether the safety feature is actually useful or not, it's agreat marketing tool. Samsung initiated their waterproof model with their Galaxy GS4 Active to critical acclaim.7 Stocks to Sell Before They ImplodeOf course, there's much more to Apple's flagship product than making it accident proof. According toInvestorPlace writer Tom Taulli, there are already ""indications that the device will be standout, such as with OLED (organic light emitting diodes) screens, which will be thinner and perhaps even allow for bending. Interestingly enough, there may not even be a bezel, which will not only make the device look sleeker - one of Apple's hallmarks - but allow more room on the screen.""We also must consider the Apple stock price in comparative value against the broader consumer technology industry. As Taulli notes, ""AAPL stock still sports a reasonable valuation, with the forward price-to-earnings ratio of 11.5X. Hey,Microsoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) is at 19X andOracle Corporation(NYSE:ORCL) is trading at 14X.""To go along with this analysis, you have to appreciate the creative synergy that drives Apple stock. Despite roadblocks like theSupreme Court decisionthat has serious implications for intellectual property rights, AAPL, and by extension, AAPL stock keeps on chugging. I don't doubt for a second that they'll continue asserting themselves in the retail market. They're too much of avaluable entityfor any other course of action.Weaknesses in Apple's ArmorYet it's in the financial markets where Apple stock loses some sheen. AsInvestor's Business Dailywryly notes, in the same year that AAPL ""opens an edifice to its greatness - a massive new headquarters that looks like a flying saucer - the company faces growing questions about its future and whether it can still surprise and delight customers with exciting new gadgets."" Furthermore, expectations are ""sky-high that 2017's 10th anniversary iPhone will be something special that unleashes the full potential of the Apple revenue-generating ecosystem.""No one questions that AAPL stock is backed by a solid team carrying out founder Steve Jobs' grand vision. Nevertheless, that's a lot of pressure riding on the company. It's a well-known fact that a majority of AAPL's sales and profits comes from the iPhone. In fact, we are starting to see some kinks in the vaunted armor.Again,Investor's Business Dailywrites that iPhone ""sales declined last year for the first time ever, during the iPhone 6S cycle. They could fall again this year, during the iPhone 7 cycle. In fiscal 2016, iPhone unit sales declined 8%, while iPhone revenue shrank 12%.""Furthermore, there's an overreliance on its smartphone division that could come back to haunt them. A glaring example is the fact that Apple hasn't done much of anything with its premium line of Mac computers. Sure, that industry is in decline, but Apple has always been chic-cool. If it's abandoning Macs in favor of portable e-devices, it's going to be in a dogfight with discount-price leaders.And if it can't protect its designs as the Supreme Court decision implies, that just makes Apple's job all the more difficult. Hence, it either needs to kill it with its new iPhones or it needs other products for diversification.Technical Challenges AheadClick to EnlargeThis is where we get into a real tough decision. My heart tells me that AAPL is going to be just fine - and there's good reason to believe that.But Apple stock really hasn't shown that much confidence. Yeah, it's soared from last summer, but that's what rallies from yearly lows are supposed to do. What happens next is the critical question.In 2015, Apple stock took multiple bites at $130, only to be rebuffed. It then faltered, and only began to pick itself up just recently. Now, it's heading toward another crack at the psychological price target. Is the fifth time the charm? I'm sure AAPL stock is good for another 8% or 9% - enough to get real close to $130.Abandon General Electric Company (GE) Stock     After Q4 EarningsBut to actually breach that level and build something substantive on top of it? That's where I have my doubts about Apple stock. What AAPL does, no one does better. But after so many years following the release of the first smart devices, the consumer is expecting much more. Apple will deliver, but what it does may not be so exciting for Wall Street.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto was long SNE stock.More From InvestorPlaceThe Most Dangerous Dividend Stocks for 20173 Vanguard Funds That Are Taking on WaterThe postApple Inc.

Mattel's Aristotle Connects Wired Child, Smart Home;1/20/2017;"""Alexa, play digger, digger,'"" the redheaded,   still-learning-to-speak toddler in the video appears to tell a   small electronic device on a bedside stand.The family's new Amazon.com (AMZN) Echo Dot, one of the more popular voice recognition personal   assistant devices, replies:""You want to hear a station from porn detected, porno ring   tone, hot chick amateur girl …"" Frantic relatives scramble to   shut off the device as it veers into some highly NSFW (not safe   for work) language.makeArticleAd();The now-viral video is a prime example of how cutting-edge   language recognition tools fail when faced with kid-speak. Toy   makerMattel(MAT) recognized the failure as an opportunity: a market niche for a   kid-focused, parent-controlled smart speaker amid a growing   connected-home market.Alexa, Meet AristotleLaunched this month at CES, the Consumer Electronic Show in   Las Vegas,  Mattel's Aristotle sets the market's early   standard. Slated to hit the shelves this summer, the gizmo is the   brainchild of Mattel's Nabi unit, the maker of colorful   children's tablet computers acquired a year ago for $21.5 million   from its bankrupt parent, Fuhu.The friendly-looking red-and-white, camera-equipped   Aristotle looks like a cross between an Amazon Echo and a baby   monitor. The design is a joint effort between Mattel,Qualcomm(QCOM), Silk Labs, andMicrosoft's(MSFT) Cognitive Services and Cortana Intelligence.Cortana is Microsoft's voice recognition personal assistant   product, similar to Apple's Siri, Amazon's Alexa and Google's   Assistant.Aristotle is no Echo. The design is uniquely tailored to   recognize the idiosyncrasies of young children's speech. The cost   of that development reflects in its $299 price - more than double   that of the devices geared for grown ups.IBD'S TAKE:The N in theCAN SLIM investing strategystands for new, because new management, new company strategy or     structure and innovative new products are all historic traits     of winning stocks.But even at that price, Aristotle earns its keep. It starts   with a WiFi-enabled camera capable of motion detection and object   recognition.  It's got a ""smart light system"" that includes   a night light, reading light and changing light. And new parents   will probably be intrigued to know that Aristotle can not only   reorder baby supplies, but also flick on a lullaby and dim   the lights when the little one wakes up crying.""Our solution is hyper-focused on the nursery and in early   learning,"" Mattel Senior Manager of Marketing and Communications   Lisa Lee told Investor's Business Daily via email.The company aims to introduce Aristotle to a home at around   the same time a baby is coming into the family ""because it is   firstly, a voice-controlled smart baby monitor,"" Lee said.High-tech nursery gadgets aren't new. Mattel-owned   Fisher-Price offers smart rockers, swings and crib mobiles. Nabi   also makes kids' fitness trackers, as well as tablet   computers.But security and monitoring is where many consumers dip their   toes into connected-home products, said Ben Arnold, NPD   Group's executive director of consumer technology. So it's not   surprising, he says, to see a product that combines remote   monitoring, a sound machine and changing lights to soothe a   child.It's ""pretty much in line with the overall movement in   the smart home market,"" he said.A Budding $200 Billion MarketThe smart-home, or connected-home, market is projected to hit   $83 billion this year and more than double to $195 billion by   2021, according to Juniper Research. The category is broad - it   includes automation, lighting, entertainment, wellness and   monitoring - with enough products to fill a ""Jetsons""-style home,   from Philips' wireless Hue bulbs to Nest's smart thermostats and   smoke alarms to Samsung's extensive SmartThings line.Amazon leads the way, said the report, followed by Samsung,   Google ownerAlphabet(GOOGL) and Apple - and the ""Big 4"" aren't likely to give up their   spots anytime soon. But among specific sectors, the maturing   smart entertainment segment is seen slowing as smart appliances   and home automation take hold of consumer interest.""The share from connected services such as Netflix and Amazon   are set to fall from 70% of the total market in 2017 to 50% in   2021,"" said Juniper. ""Meanwhile, growing segments such as   Monitoring & Automation will be driven by disruptive   entrants, such as littleBits, Notion and iVee, who will rival   established players by taking novel approaches to product   development.""In the smart speaker/digital assistant space, Aristotle joins   the $180 Amazon Echo, $129 Google Home and another CES debutante,   the Google Assistant-equippedNvidia(NVDA) Spot. (The Spot - a small smart speaker that can go   in any room - enhances the reach of the Shield, Nvidia's new   media-streaming device.)It's a hot space: After its Fall debut, the Google Home   quickly became the fifth best-selling wireless speaker brand on   the market, with 7.3% dollar share, according to November   2016 data from NPD. (A notable asterisk: the firm does not track   Echo sales data, and the category is admittedly broad and   includes more traditional wireless speakers.) Google zipped   up to the No. 5 spot behind JBL, Ultimate Ears, Sonos and top   dog, Bose.We're on a ""good course"" toward the mainstreaming of smart   speakers, said Arnold, although it remains to be seen what kind   of applications will be most popular among users. Hailing an   Uber? Ordering takeout? Making to-do lists?""It's less about a speaker that sits on your tabletop and more   about (how) your digital assistant can work its way into your   lifestyle,"" he said.The Aristotle's focus on child care means it is unlikely to   become challenge Echo as a mainstream hit. But the smart speaker   is designed to help kids of all ages, providing a stealthy   opportunity for it to grow on the family whom it serves.According to the company, the device can quiz toddlers on   their ABCs, help grade-schoolers with their homework, and teach   tweens foreign languages.That kind of stickiness is valuable - especially as young   people gravitate toward AI help. A recent Accenture study said   31% of 14- to 17-year-olds use voice-enabled digital assistants   regularly vs. just 14% of 35- to 55-year-olds, according to   eMarketer.And should it choose to, there's precious user data to be   mined for Mattel, including ""regional idiosyncrasies, national   (trends) that are sticking"" or even what kind of product it   should be distributing to retailers likeTarget(TGT) orWal-Mart(WMT), said Morningstar analyst Jaime Katz.Every Home A Smart Home In Five To 10 Years?Amazon, that destroyer of publishing and retail worlds, is   poised to stay ahead of the pack.NPD's Arnold pointed out that there's a ""decent amount"" of   overlap between Aristotle and Echo's capabilities, and suggested   that the continual tweaking Amazon does to Alexa could narrow   that gap.""You could certainly have a scenario where Amazon improves   Alexa and she's able to differentiate (between) kids' voices,"" he   said, conjuring up an Alexa of the future that would be able to   cater specifically to whomever is talking to her at the time.Mizuho Securities points to the combined power of Amazon's   Echo and Alexa amassing $11 billion in revenue for the company by   2020.Calling Amazon a ""leader in home automation,""   Mizuho analyst Neil Doshi wrote on Jan. 9 that he sees $4   billion of that revenue coming from sales of Echo devices and the   rest stemming from Alexa-based transaction revenue.How much revenue potential the Aristotle holds for Mattel   isn't immediately clear.Morningstar's Katz says sales from Aristotle are ""incremental,   but not something that changes the overall valuation of   (Mattel's) business.""Mattel's Lee declined to comment on projected revenue, but   said the company sees ""ample opportunity to bring new   technology-enabled play and learning products to market.""And as the smart home pie grows ever larger, devices like   Echo, Home and possibly even Aristotle could challenge   smartphones to become the nerve center for a home's connected   electronics.With an estimated 22 million connected homes in the U.S.   last year, according to a recent McKinsey report, that number is   expected to grow to 29 million this year, with a compound annual   growth rate of 31%.""With technological advances in voice control and artificial   intelligence, the intelligent assistant is now a viable control   center for the connected home,"" wrote McKinsey researchers, who   wrote separately that they see connected-home penetration rising   from ""from 22 percent today to every home being connected in five   to ten years.""And even as Alexa poses a threat to the dirty-word-free   innocence of childhood, Mattel isn't looking for a fight. It   sees Aristotle, which reportedly also includes Alexa as a   built-in digital assistant for the grown-ups, getting along just   fine with the Echo and Home.""We don't compete with other voice-assistants or home   automation devices,"" said Mattel's Lee. ""If a household utilizes   other smart home devices, Aristotle will be compatible with a   growing number of other (Internet of Things) systems.""RELATED:Can This New Device Beat Out Amazon Echo,     Google Home, Nvidia Spot?"

We note that the company's strategy to trim down its global workforce given a shrinking PC business worldwide is a step in the right direction and will boost the company's bottom line in the to-be reported quarter.Moreover, strong demand for hybrid drives also augurs well for the company going into the earnings season. Notably, on Oct 25, Seagate launched the world's fastest hard drive - Seagate Enterprise Performance 15K HDD v6 for enabling mission critical applications. Also, on Oct 28, 2016 Seagate launched its LaCie line of products targeted at creative professionals. Additionally, Seagate introduced a dedicated game drive for Xbox SSD on Oct 31, which is likely to have a positive impact on the company's earnings in the to-be reported quarter.However, declining PC shipments and intensifying competition in the storage space are likely to remain overhangs.Overall, we expect to witness an earnings beat from Seagate this time around.Seagate Technology PLC Price and EPS SurpriseSeagate Technology PLC Price and EPS Surprise|Seagate Technology PLC QuoteOther Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other companies you may want to consider as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Corning IncorporatedGLWwith an Earnings ESP of +6.98% and a Zacks Rank #2.You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks   here.Microsoft CorporationMSFTwith an Earnings ESP of +1.28% and a Zacks Rank #2.TE Connectivity Ltd.TELwith an Earnings ESP of +1.00% and a Zacks Rank #2.The Best Place to Start Your Stock SearchToday, you are invited to download the full list of 220 Zacks Rank #1 ""Strong Buy"" stocks - absolutely free of charge.

Apple Inc. New iPads Might Be Late to the Party (AAPL);1/20/2017;"InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading     TipsIt's a pretty safe bet at this point thatApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) is releasing new iPads in 2017. Rumors had been pointing to a   March special event for AAPL to take the wraps off its latest   tablets, including the iPad Air 3 and two new iPad Pro   models.However, a newly released report - based on information from   Apple's supply chain - suggests the launch may be pushed to the   second half of 2017.makeArticleAd();New iPads Delayed9to5Macreported on aDigitimesstory based on sources from within Apple's supply chain. These   sources claim that the new iPads are still in the planning stage,   and may not be released or even announceduntil the second half of 2017.Many Apple watchers expected a Marchspecial event announcing the new iPads(the 9.7-inch iPad Pro was unveiled at a March 2016 event),   but that timeframe now seems in doubt. Summer product   announcements are practically unheard of. Everyone is in vacation   mode and not paying close attention to what tech companies are   doing. That makes a fall announcement and release the most likely   option if spring falls through.MacRumorselaborated on potential causes for the delay, besides the generic   ""being stuck in the design phase"" description. The site points to   speculation that the new A10X processor, which would power the   new iPad Pro models, is running into manufacturing challenges.   Reports since December have said the chips aresuffering from lower than expected yield   rates.3 Things Apple Inc. (AAPL) MUST Do to Soar in       2017If so, this wouldn't be the first time pushing the boundaries   of technology has tripped up Apple, or other consumer tech   companies.Fitbit Inc(NYSE:FIT) andGoPro Inc(NASDAQ:GPRO) both faced retail shortages of new products prior to Christmasdue to production issues.What to Expect: New iPad Pro Models and iPad Air 3While nothing is certain when trying to anticipate AAPL's   moves, the expectation of what the company will release in terms   of new iPads is beginning to firm up.The consensus among Apple watchers and analysts is leaning   toward a second generation, 12.9-inch iPad Pro, powered by the   A10X chip. This is AAPL's flagship tablet, competing against the   likes ofMicrosoft Corporation's(NASDAQ:MSFT) Surface Pro 4. Apple will want to keep its momentum in the   professional/enterprise tablet space.An all-new iPad Pro model in the form of a 10.5-inch,   bezel-free device that's a more business-friendly size than the   current 9.7-inch iPad Pro likely will make its debut.As for the 9.7-inch form factor, that's up in the air. It's   too small for many business users, so there's a good chance Apple   will drop the ""Pro"" designation. Instead, it would become the new   low-cost midsize tablet in the Apple lineup, repackaged as the   iPad Air 3.Experts also expect a new version of the Apple Pencil stylus   to be in the mix.If theDigitimesreport is correct and AAPL is forced to push the release of new   iPads to the second half of the year, the company could have a   very crowded calendar come fall.Apple Inc. (AAPL) Faces New Challenges for       the iPhone 8The 10th anniversary iPhone 8 is a given for September. There   are rumors that anApple Watch Series 3could accompany the new iPhone on stage. Analysts are calling for   a refreshed MacBook Pro with new Kaby Lake CPUs fromIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) to go into production in the third quarter. The Apple TV is   also overdue for a refresh, and fall is typically when it gets   featured.That may make for a quiet spring for Apple.Updated iMacs and MacBooks might give it something to show   off. But going into the holiday shopping season, AAPL would have   a killer lineup of new products, including that all-important   iPhone 8, plus long-awaited new iPads.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position     in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceMicrosoft Corporation (MSFT) Steps on Amazon       and Google's Turf7 Stocks to Sell Before They Implode10 Stocks to Buy for Donald Trump's Second       WindThe postApple Inc.

Market projection suggests 5G data rates to be 10X the speed of card 4G and LTE solutions. Based on its product portfolio the company is well positioned to address the connectivity challenges both these markets present. This will eventually drive top-line growth in the long run.Margin ContractsNon-GAAP gross margin contracted 20 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis but remained almost flat sequentially to 50.7%.Research & development (R&D) expense increased 20 bps, while selling, general & administrative (SG&A) expense remained almost flat from the year-ago quarter.

Management stated that it is well poised for margin expansion in second-half 2017, driven by sequential revenue growth.Non-GAAP earnings are anticipated to be $1.40 per share, much better-than the Zacks Consensus Estimate that was pegged at $1.28.Skyworks also announced a new share buyback program worth $500 million.Share Price Expected to ReboundNotably, Skywork shares have gained 23.9% in the last one year, underperforming the ZacksSemiconductors - Radio Frequencyindustry's return of 31.8%.

Waters Corp. (WAT) Q4 Earnings: Will the Stock Disappoint?;1/20/2017;"Waters CorporationWATis set to report fourth-quarter and full-year 2016 earnings results, before the opening bell on Jan 24.Breaking its impressive streak of nine back-to-back earnings beats, Waters Corp. had reported in-line earnings in its third-quarter 2016 results. Overall, the company has an average positive surprise of 3.0%, with three beats over the trailing four quarters.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors Influencing this QuarterWeakness in academic and government demand is expected to play a major spoilsport for Waters Corp.'s fourth-quarter results. Unfavorable order timing and volatility associated with the instrument-heavy business have been hampering performance of the academic and the government businesses. Softness in key end markets, including Japan, Europe and the U.S., is proving to be a major drag on these business lines.In addition, a sluggish industrial segment has been lingering longer than anticipated, hurting the company's prospects, in turn. Global weakness in the chemical industry is likely to restrict the sales of both TA Instruments and Waters' product lines during the fourth quarter, thus adding to the company's woes.Waters Corp. Price and EPS SurpriseWaters Corp. Price and EPS Surprise|Waters Corp. QuoteAlso, high R&D expenses over the last few years have been hurting the company's financials. In third-quarter 2016, R&D expenses (including new product development expenses and incremental investment outlay) were up roughly 8%, on a constant currency basis, over the previous-year quarter. The higher outlay, although beneficial in the long run, will likely flare up expenses and affect immediate profits for the soon-to-be-reported quarter.This apart, debt levels and the consequent interest expenses remain a burden due to its recent acquisitions. Moreover, given that Waters Corp. generates a substantial portion of its revenues from the non-U.S. markets, currency volatility is also estimated to thwart top-line growth to some extent.Despite these challenges, pharmaceuticals business - the company's major revenue driver - is likely to supplement revenue growth for the fourth quarter. Waters Corp.'s robust product portfolio and growing adoption of the previously launched products, including ACQUITY Arc System, Vion IMS QTof Mass Spectrometer and UNIFI Scientific Information System Software, are also projected to rake in profits.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Waters Corp. is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, that is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks ESP:TheEarnings ESPrepresents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. This leads to an ESP of -1.41% for Waters Corp. as the Most Accurate estimate is pegged $2.10, while the consensus estimate is pegged higher at $2.13. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with ourEarnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank:Waters Corp. has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).  We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Applied Optoelectronics, Inc.AAOIhas an Earnings ESP of +15.9% and a Zacks Rank #1.

TE Connectivity (TEL) Q1 Earnings: Stock Poised to Beat;1/20/2017;"We expect WatersTE Connectivity Ltd.TELto beat earnings expectations when it reports first-quarter fiscal 2017 results before the opening bell on Jan 25.The company has an excellent earnings surprise history, with an average positive surprise of 5.6% for the trailing four quarters. TE Connectivity scored its fourth consecutive earnings beat, during the last reported quarter, as it beat estimates by 6.7%.We expect the company to post an earnings beat in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that TE Connectivity is likely to beat earnings because it has the right combination of two key ingredients.Zacks ESP:TheEarnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +1.00%. This is a very meaningful and leading indicator of a likely earnings surprise.Zacks Rank:TE Connectivity carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 or 3 (Hold) have a significantly higher chance of beating estimates. On the other hand, Sell-rated stocks (#4 and 5) should not be considered going into an earnings announcement.The combination of TE Connectivity's Zacks Rank #2 and ESP of +1.00% makes us confident of an earnings beat in the upcoming report.Growth Factors for the QuarterTE Connectivity, a market leader in the connectivity and sensor business, is armed with a comprehensive portfolio that supplements its strength. About 80% of the company's revenues are driven by harsh environment applications. For the past five years, the company's harsh business applications have been experiencing mid-single digit growth, bolstering revenues. We believe that stellar traction of harsh environment applications will continue to support the top line and margin growth for first-quarter 2017.TE Connectivity Ltd. Price and EPS SurpriseTE Connectivity Ltd. Price and EPS Surprise|TE   Connectivity Ltd. QuoteIn addition, all three segments of the company, namely Transportation, Industrial and Communications businesses are expected to act as key profit churners for the quarter to be reported. In addition, robust expansion in the heavy truck market, especially in Asia, is likely to stoke the growth of Commercial Transportation business. Further, robust growth of Commercial Aerospace and Defense business makes us believe that Industrial segment is poised to register a decent performance.Further, the communications segment has bright prospects and is estimated to grow in low-single digits, by appliances and SubCom business line. Especially, SubCom is anticipated to remain as one of the strongest growth drivers, with its $1-billion backlog, benefiting from the build-out of the cloud.Over the past year, strategic acquisitions have given TE a leading position in solutions for the minimally-invasive medical market, fortified its portfolio of industrial connectors and bolstered the company's offering of sensors for the auto market. We believe that the previously completed acquisitions, including AdvancedCath, Measurement Specialties and Creganna will propel the company's inorganic revenues substantially.TE Connectivity has charted an impressive growth of 12.5% for the past six months, outpacing the Zacks categorizedElectronics-MiscellaneousComponents industry average of 6.3%.Other Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some other companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Applied Optoelectronics, Inc.AAOIhas an Earnings ESP of +15.9% and a Zacks Rank #1.

Check Point (CHKP) Stock Up on Q4 Earnings & Sales Beat;1/20/2017;"makeZacksArticleAd();Shares ofCheck Point Software Technologies Ltd.CHKPwere up 7.5% yesterday following the company's announcement of impressive fourth-quarter 2016 results, wherein its revenues and earnings came ahead of its own expectations as well as the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Check Point's adjusted earnings per share (including stock-based compensation but excluding amortization of intangible assets) of $1.33 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.15. Adjusted earnings also climbed approximately 21% on a year-over-year basis, driven mainly by higher revenues and a lower share count, which were partially offset by higher operating expenses.On a non-GAAP (excluding stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets) basis, the cybersecurity company posted earnings of $1.46, which were not only 21.7% higher than the year-ago quarter but way ahead of its own guidance range of $1.20 to $1.28. Moreover, it should be noted that this was the best quarterly non-GAAP EPS growth rate the company has witnessed since the third quarter of 2010.Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseCheck Point Software Technologies Ltd. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise|Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. QuoteRevenuesFourth-quarter revenues came in at $486.7 million, up 6.3% year over year, and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $477 million. The figure was also close to the upper end of the company's guidance range of $460 million to $490 million (mid-point $475 million).Top-line growth was aided by sales growth of 9.7% in Products & Software Blades and 1.6% in Software Updates and Maintenance. The company also reported a 25.5% surge in subscription revenues at Software Blades.Check Point witnessed higher demand for data center and high-end appliances. Another factor contributing to overall growth was the increased number of large deal signings. The number of new customers who signed deals worth $1 million or more was 99, a 15% increase from the year-ago quarter's tally of 86. Moreover, customers who signed deals worth $50,000 and more contributed 76% to the total order value, up from 72% registered in the fourth quarter of 2015.Geographically, the Americas contributed 47% to revenues and Europe accounted for 38%, while Asia-Pacific, Japan, and the Middle East and Africa added the remaining 15%.Operating ResultsOn a year-over-year basis, adjusted gross profit (including stock-based compensation but excluding amortization of intangible assets) increased 6.1% to $428.5 million. However, as a percentage of revenues, gross profit contracted 20 basis points (bps) to 88%.Adjusted operating expenses (including stock-based compensation but excluding amortization of intangible assets) rose 13.8% year over year to $183.8 million as the company continued to make investments. The increase may also be attributed to higher research and development, and selling and marketing expenses as well as to acquisitions made over the past year. As a percentage of revenues, operating expenses increased 250 basis points (bps).Adjusted operating income (including stock-based compensation but excluding amortization of intangible assets) came in at $244.7 million, up nearly 1% year over year. However, margins contracted 260 bps as a percentage of revenues mainly due to higher operating expenses.Adjusted net income (including stock-based compensation but excluding amortization of intangible assets and other one-time items calculated on a proportionate tax basis) was $225.3 million or $1.33 per share, up from $197.7 million or $1.10 reported last year.Balance Sheet & Cash FlowCheck Point exited the year with cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and short-term investments of approximately $3.669 billion. During 2016, the company generated operating cash flow of $923 million. Moreover, Check Point repurchased $988 million worth of common stock in 2016.OutlookTaking into account the back-to-back quarters of favorable business trends, Check Point provided a strong revenue and earnings guidance for the first quarter and full year 2017.The company expects to generate revenues between $420 million and $440 million (mid-point $430 million). The mid-point of the guidance is slightly higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $428.7 million. Non-GAAP earnings are projected in a range of $1.15 to $1.20 per share. GAAP earnings per share are anticipated to be 17 cents or less. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.03 per share.For 2017, Check Point anticipates to generate revenues between $1.85 billion and $1.90 billion (mid-point $1.875 billion). The mid-point of the guided range was is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.84 billion. Non-GAAP earnings are projected in a range of $5.05 to $5.25 per share. GAAP earnings per share are anticipated to be 70 cents or less. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $4.39 per share.Our TakeCheck Point ended 2016 on a strong note, reporting better-than-expected results for the fourth quarter. The robust year-over-year upside in the top and bottom lines was encouraging. Buoyed by a strong quarterly performance, the company provided a solid outlook for the first quarter and full year 2017.Favorable fourth quarter results and a strong outlook sent shares of this Israel-based cybersecurity firm as high as $97.92, touching nearly its 16-year high. However, the intraday gain slightly cooled off later in the day and the stock settled at $96.34, up 7.5% from the previous day's closing price.Notably, Check Point has been clocking solid returns over the last three months and has gained approximately 25%, outperforming the Zacks categorizedComputer-Softwareindustry's gain of just 6.2%.Moving ahead, rapid adoption of Check Point's data center appliances and continuous enhancements in data center product lines are expected to provide ample top-line support.Furthermore, we believe that Check Point Software will continue to benefit from strong demand for cybersecurity solutions. Note that the financial well-being, brand image and reputation of enterprises and governments are always exposed to the risk of cyber threats. Consequently, cybersecurity has become a mission-critical, high-profile requirement.Per IDC's report, corporate spending on threat intelligence security services will reach $1.4 billion in 2018 from an estimated $905.5 million in 2014. Another research firm, MarketsandMarkets, projects that the global threat intelligence security market will reach approximately $5.86 billion by 2020 from $3.0 billion in 2015, representing compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 14.3%.We believe Check Point Software is capitalizing on this opportunity and this may well be reflected in the company's forthcoming quarterly results. Additionally, the company's efforts on continuous share buybacks bode well for investors.Check Point currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Is Texas Instruments (TXN) Poised to Beat on Q4 Earnings?;1/20/2017;"makeZacksArticleAd();Texas Instruments Inc.TXNor TI, a global semiconductor company and one of the world's leading designers and suppliers of digital signal processors and analog integrated circuits, is expected to beat expectations when it reports fourth-quarter 2016 results on Jan 24.Over the last one year, the stock has underperformed the ZacksSemiconductor Generalindustry. It has gained 48.26% compared to the industry's gain of 49.02%.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that TI is likely to beat estimates this quarter. A stock needs to have both a positiveEarnings ESPand a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Texas Instruments has the right combination of two key components.Zacks ESP:The company currently has an Earnings ESP of +1.24%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at 82 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 81 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with ourEarnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Texas Instruments currently carries a Zacks Rank #3, which when combined with an ESP of +1.24% makes us reasonably confident of a positive surprise.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Texas Instruments Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseTexas Instruments Inc. Price and EPS Surprise|Texas Instruments Inc. QuoteFactors at PlayTexas Instruments is currently riding high on strengthening auto and industrial markets. The communications and enterprise market is also improving. Personal electronics and other markets remain weak but TI has done well to tackle the challenges.Internally, the company has always executed rather well. It, along with chipmaker Intel (INTC) remains one of the few semiconductor companies that depend on internal capacity for manufacturing the bulk of its devices. Since the company usually builds out capacity well ahead of demand, it is able to make opportunistic purchases. As a result, it is able to contain capex at up to 4% of sales even while on an expansion plan.Overall, we remain optimistic about TI's compelling product line, the differentiation in its business and lower-cost 300mm Analog output that should drive earnings. We note that channel inventories remain very low, meaning that demand is likely to remain strong.Texas Instruments also continues to prudently invest its R&D dollars into several high-margin, high-growth areas of the analog and embedded processing markets. This is gradually increasing its exposure to the industrial and automotive markets and increasing dollar content at customers, while reducing its exposure to the volatile consumer/computing markets.According to TI's guidance for the fourth quarter, revenues are expected between $3.17 billion and $3.43 billion (down 10.8% sequentially at the mid-point). Earnings for the quarter are expected to be 76 to 86 cents. Capex target remains at 4% of revenues.Stocks to ConsiderSeagate Technology plcSTX, with an Earnings ESP of +1.87% and Zacks Rank #1.

7 Best ETFs For Your Growth And Income Needs As Trump Takes The Wheel;1/20/2017;"""Wait and see"" is the mantra of ETF investors as Donald Trump   assumes the reins of the highest office in the land. Will his   ambitious campaign proposals translate to policy or get lost   in translation?""The U.S. equity markets have enjoyed a classic 'buy the   rumor' rally,"" built around Trump's promises, said David Haviland   of Beaumont Capital, an expert at investing in exchange traded   funds. ""The question is, what will be the news that causes the   sell?""Haviland is one of two money managers who spoke to IBD   recently about their stock market outlook as well as their bestETF   investment ideasfor the year ahead. For the moment, Haviland is making some   bullish bets.makeArticleAd();One of Haviland's picks, O'Shares FTSE U.S. Quality Dividend (OUSA) holds stocks that could rocket if Trump delivers fiscal   stimulus as promised and allows U.S. companies to bring home   their offshore cash.Henry Ma of Julex Capital, another investing pro, expects two   postelection rotation trades - from bonds to equities and from   high yield to growth - to continue. His ETF picks, too, reflect   an overall optimism.Still, both Haviland and Ma have eyes wide open to downside   risks. Like many other investors, they straddle hope and   caution as the White House welcomes its newest resident.Here they are in their own words:David Haviland is managing partner and portfolio   manager at Beaumont Capital Management, a Needham,   Mass.-based asset manager offering ETF-based growth strategies   with defensive capabilities since 2009; assets under management   and advisement: $3.7 billion as of September 2016.After the Nov. 8 election, the U.S. equity markets have   enjoyed a classic ""buy the rumor"" rally. The rally has focused on   the promises made during the election and the prospects for   beneficial change.Specifically, some of the key topics include a $1 trillion,   10-year Federal stimulus package to improve infrastructure, the   reworking of the federal corporate tax system to make our tax   code more competitive, the renegotiation of several trade   agreements that currently induce the exportation of jobs, and the   likelihood of large amounts of repatriation of U.S. multinational   foreign profits.All of these items should serve to stimulate growth and   reflation here in the U.S. The question is, what will be the news   that causes the sell? Investors tend to buy the rumor and sell   the news.Here are four ETFs that should do well in 2017. These ETFs are   currently owned or could be purchased at any time within BCM   strategies.O'Shares FTSE U.S. Quality Dividend(OUSA) uses a rules-based process to screen for various levels of     quality, including low volatility, liquidity, high cash flow,     dividend growth and dividend yield.In a low-interest-rate environment, the baby boomers need   income from their portfolio to live off of. O'Shares has   distilled the universe of large-cap equities down to a portfolio   of 151 companies across all sectors that should provide better   long-term, risk-adjusted returns.Examples of these portfolio companies with superior balance   sheets includeApple(AAPL),Johnson & Johnson(JNJ),Microsoft(MSFT),Exxon Mobil(XOM) andProcter & Gamble(PG). (Editor's note: OUSA has a 2.32% 12-month yield.)First Trust Dow Jones Internet(FDN) holds mostly ""new tech,"" or companies poised to     innovate and change our world using the web/cloud.To be included, at least 50% of a company's sales and revenue   must come from the internet. The ETF also uses a more limited   screening process for liquidity and size. The top holdings   include the ""FANG"" stocks -Facebook(FB),Amazon(AMZN),Netflix(NFLX) and (Google parent)Alphabet(GOOGL).PowerShares Global Water(PIO) invests in companies that conserve or purify water across     the globe.Over one-third of humanity currently lives without clean   water. The infrastructure required for this most important   resource will be massive here in the U.S. as well as across the   globe in both developed and emerging markets.The ETF should benefit from Trump's infrastructure build here   in the U.S. We do not currently own this ETF but we have in   the past, and it could make its way back into the portfolio in   2017.Top positions in the fund includeDanaher(DHR), London-basedWolseley,Switzerland-basedGeberitand France-basedVeolia Environmental, which illustrates the global reach.(Editor's note: While the ETF has relatively low average   trading volume, a large asset manager like BCM can access the   underlying liquidity of the stocks in the index through the   create/redeem process.)IShares 0-5 Year TIPS Bond(STIP) is a ""double-duty"" rising-rate defensive play for     bonds.In a rising-rate environment, Treasury inflation protected   securities (TIPS) tend to perform better than regular bonds given   their yield plus inflation construct - the principal rises with   inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, while the   yield is fixed.This ETF also uses a short duration, currently 2.4 years, as   added protection against rising rates. It yields 0.89%.Henry Ma is president and chief investment officer     at Julex Capital Management, an SEC-registered     quantitative investment management firm based in Boston. The     firm's tactical unconstrained investment solutions aim to limit     downside risks while maximizing upside potential; total client     assets as of September 2016: $358 million.As we enter 2017, we may be witnessing major shifts of   economic policies, which could have significant impacts on   financial markets. The new year is likely to see a continuing   rise of protectionism, which is evidenced notably in the Brexit   referendum and the U.S. presidential election.This trend could undermine global growth, but there will be   winners and losers. The export-dependent sectors have the most to   lose.After eight years of monetary stimulus, policymakers among the   developed countries have realized that loose monetary policies   are no longer effective and fiscal policies are needed to spur   economic growth. In the U.S., President-elect Donald Trump has   pledged to reduce taxes and spend $1 trillion on   infrastructure.These potential fiscal expansion programs have   improved growth prospects, fueling higher inflation   expectations, pushing bond yields upward, and causing losses for   bond holders. We will see more rotation from bonds to equities in   this reflationary environment. Within the equity markets, the   yield-seeking trade has run its course as investors rotate from   high-yielding sectors to growth sectors. We expect these two   rotation trades to continue, and recommend three ETFs that could   outperform in 2017.Financial Select Sector SPDR(XLF) provides the most liquid and low-cost cap-weighted     exposure to the financial sector of the S&P 500.The Fed is likely to raise interest rates to 1.25%-1.50% at   the end of 2017. This higher rate will certainly boost the profit   margin for financial stocks. The potential appeal or revision of   financial regulations such as Dodd-Frank by the Trump   administration will also help improve their profitability and   earnings growth.Technology Select Sector SPDR(XLK) provides the most liquid and low-cost cap-weighted     exposure to the technology sector of the S&P 500.As we expect the U.S. economy to grow above 3% in 2017, the   tech sector will benefit from increasing demand and higher   revenue growth. The valuation is still attractive as the sector   is traded at a slightly lower forward PE ratio than the S&P   500 index.IShares Russell 2000(IWM) provides the most liquid and low-cost cap-weighted     exposure to the small-cap sector.Potentially protectionist trade policies and fiscal expansion   programs will generate more domestic demand for small companies'   products. The trailing PE ratio of IWM is 21.4, which is close to   the PE ratio of the S&P 500 Index (20.4). Better growth   prospects will provide small-cap stocks with more upside   potential.(Editor's note: These ETFs are currently owned/were recently   owned by Julex Capital strategies and could be purchased at any   time within their client portfolios.)RELATED:High Yield Strategy Uses 10 ETFs To Deliver     All-Weather Income With Low Risks6 Best ETFs For When You're Both Bullish And     Cautious About The Markets"

Alibaba Group (BABA) Q3 Earnings: What Awaits the Stock?;1/20/2017;"Alibaba GroupBABAis set to report third-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Jan 24. Last quarter, the Chinese e-Commerce giant posted a positive earnings surprise of 34.04%.Over the past one year, shares of Alibaba Grouphave been steadily treading higher. The stock has returned 39.72% compared with the Zacks categorized Electronic Commerce industry's gain of 34.65%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderAlibaba's second-quarter fiscal 2017 earnings of 63 cents per share exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 47 cents. The solid growth in its core e-commerce business as well as growing cloud computing services led to the strong results. Management expects these factors to continue driving results for the upcoming quarter.Revenues were also up sequentially as well as year over year. The increase was driven by continued revenue growth in China's commerce retail business and the consolidation of newly acquired businesses (namely Youku Tudou and Lazada).The Chinese e-Commerce company, which operates as a platform for third-party sellers, neither sell goods directly to merchants nor holds inventory. Alibaba Group's strong market position in China, uninterrupted growth in mobile business, unfazed improvement in commerce retail business and improving gross merchandise value should boost fiscal third-quarter earnings.Additionally, Alibaba is expected to continue witnessing increase in monetization rates. The company is building up its online marketing inventory on both mobile and PC. Also due to higher monetization rate, its profits are too expected to go up.However, the company has been making huge investments in varied growth initiatives. This could impact profits to some extent in the near term. Also, macro headwinds and increasing competition could dampen the upcoming results.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not show that Alibaba Groupwill beat on earnings this fiscal quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positiveEarnings ESPand a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP:Both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 85 cents. Hence, the difference is 0.00%.

What's in Store for Comcast (CMCSA) this Earnings Season?;1/20/2017;"Comcast Corp.CMCSA, the leading cable multi-service operator (MSO) in the U.S., is slated to report fourth-quarter 2016 results on Jan 26, before the opening bell.Last quarter, Comcast Corp.'s bottom-line matched the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, the company's earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the previous four quarters, with an average beat of 1.58%.Moreover, shares of Comcast Corp. witnessed growth of 11.86% in the past three months, outperforming the Zacks categorizedCable TVindustry's increase of 8.51% in the same time frame.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayComcast has forayed into the over-the-top video delivery market with the launch of its Internet TV service - ""Stream"". We believe this would help the company check customer churn and provide viewers with more streaming options and flexibility at breakthrough prices. Further, Comcast's Cable business is doing well and the NBC Universal segment is witnessing significant improvement. It also announced that it will be starting its own wireless service from mid 2017. Moreover, the company is participating in the 600 MHz low-band wireless spectrum auction in the U.S.Comcast's decision to venture into the U.S. wireless space bodes well with its diversified business model. The company also expanded its theme park business through an alliance with Nintendo Co. Ltd., the worldwide leader in the creation of interactive entertainment and home video game systems such as Nintendo 64 and Game Boy. Further, it has even ventured into the lucrative digital media market seeking growth by investing in online social news site BuzzFeed. We believe that these efforts have been the reason behind Comcast Corp.'s Business Services segment's strong momentum and revenue growth. Rogers Communications Inc.RCIalso announced plans to dump its Internet Protocol TV (IPTV) platform and adopt Comcast Corp.'s cloud-based X1 video platform.However, intensifying competitive threat, consolidation-related woes, mounting programming costs and a highly leveraged balance sheet remain potent headwinds for the Comcast. Also, the company continues to bear the brunt of increasing programming expenses.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Comcast is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positiveEarnings ESPand a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

Why Microsoft Stock Gained 12% in 2016;1/19/2017;"Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella. Image source: Microsoft.What happenedShares of software giantMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) rose 12% in 2016, according to data provided byS&P Global Market Intelligence. While Microsoft made plenty of news last year, including the   blockbuster acquisition of LinkedIn, the rapid growth of its   cloud business seems to be the main thing driving the stock   higher.So whatMicrosoft reported mostly positive results throughout 2016,   consistently beating analyst estimates for revenue thanks to the   growing cloud business. Nearly all of the stock's gains occurred   following the company's fiscal fourth-quarter report in July,   which easily beat analyst estimates for both revenue and   earnings.makeArticleAd();MSFTdata byYCharts.During the fourth quarter, revenue from Azure, Microsoft's   cloud computing platform, surged 102% year over year, with usage   more than doubling. Microsoft has yet to disclose exactly how   much revenue Azure produces, but the company is recognized as a   strong No. 2 player in the cloud infrastructure market.Other cloud-based products grew quickly as well. Office 365   commercial revenue soared 54% year over year, and Office 365   consumer increased its subscriber count to 23.1 million. Dynamics   CRM Online, the subscription version of Microsoft's customer   relationship management product, grew paid seats by a factor of   2.5 compared to the prior-year period.All of these cloud businesses continued to grow quickly during   the fiscal first quarter, with Azure revenue surging 116%, Office   365 commercial revenue jumping 51%, and Office 365 consumer   adding another 900,000 subscribers. While total revenue and   earnings growth was sluggish, Microsoft CFO Amy Hood emphasized   that the company was investing and positioning itself for   long-term growth.Now whatUnder CEO Satya Nadella, Microsoft has made good progress   transitioning from a PC-centric company to one focused on the   cloud. Investors clearly liked what they saw in 2016, pushing   shares of Microsoft to their highest level since the dot-com boom   more than 15 years ago.There's still plenty of work to do, however. In June,   Microsoft chairman John Thompson questioned whether the company   was moving fast enough, worried that the traditional software   business could disappear in the matter of just a few years.Investor confidence in Microsoft's strategy grew in 2016 along   with the stock price. But for the stock to continue on its upward   path in 2017 and beyond, Microsoft will need to replace legacy   software revenue with cloud revenue fast enough to stave off a   significant sales decline. A failure to move quickly enough could   undo last year's gains.10 stocks we like better than MicrosoftWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.
